    <section title="Stored Header Encoding">
      
      <t>The Stored Header Encoding is an alternative "binary header encoding" for 
      HTTP/2.0 that combines the best elements from three other proposed encodings,
      including:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>The "Header Delta Compression" scheme proposed by Roberto Peon in
          http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rpeon-httpbis-header-compression-03</t>

        <t>The "Header Diff" encoding proposed by Herve Reullan, Jun Fujisawa,
          Romain Bellessort, and Youenn Fablet in 
          http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ruellan-headerdiff-00</t>

        <t>The "Binary Optimized Header Encoding" proposed by James Snell (me) in 
          http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-httpbis-bohe-03</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>The Stored Header Encoding seeks to find an elegant, efficient and simple
      marriage of the best concepts from each of these separate proposals.</t>

    <section title="State Model">
      
      <t>The compressor and decompressor each maintain a cache of header value pairs.
      There is a static cache, prepopulated by the specification, and a dynamic
      cache, populated through the compression and decompression process. Each 
      cache contains a maximum of 128 individual key+value pairs. </t>

      <t>Each item in the index is referenced by an 8-bit identifier. The most 
      significant bit identifies whether an item from the static or dynamic
      cache is being referenced. Note: the Nil byte (0x00) is a valid identifier
      for the dynamic cache.</t>

      <figure><artwork>
  0xxxxxxx  --  Dynamic Cache
  1xxxxxxx  --  Static Cache
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>The dynamic cache is managed in a "least recently written" style, that is, as
      the cache fills to capacity in both number of entries and maximum stored byte
      size, the least recently written items are dropped and those index positions 
      are reused.</t>

      <t>Index positions from the dynamic cache are assigned in "encounter order", 
      beginning from 0x00 and increasing monotonically to 0x7F. That is to say, the 
      positions are assigned in precisely the same order that they are serialized, 
      and thereby encountered by the decompressor upon reading and processing the 
      block.</t>

      <t>Each item in the store consists of a Header Name and a Value. The Name is a 
      lower-case ISO-8859-1 character sequence. The Value is either a UTF-8 string, 
      a number, a Timestamp or an arbitrary sequence of binary octets. </t>

      <t>The available size of the stored compression state can be capped by the 
      decompressor. Each stored value contributes to the accumulated size of the
      storage state. As new key+value pairs are assigned positions in the dynamic
      cache, the least-recently assigned items must be removed if necessary to free 
      up the required space. </t>

      <t>The size of string values is measured by the number of UTF-8 
      bytes required for the character sequence.</t>

      <t>The size of number and timestamp values are measured by the number of 
      unsigned variable length integer (uvarint) encoded bytes it takes to represent 
      the value (see the section of value types below).</t>

      <t>The size of raw binary values is measured by the number of octets.</t>

      <t>Header names DO NOT contribute to the stored state size of the compressor; 
      only the size of the value is considered. Duplicate values MUST be counted 
      individually.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="Header Serialization">
      
      <t>Headers are serialized into four typed header groups, each represented by a
      two-bit identifier. These groups are serialized sequentially. A serialized
      header block can contain, at most 256 header groups. The first byte of the
      serialized block is an unsigned, 0-based counter indicating the number of
      groups. A serialized block MUST contain at least one header group.</t>

      <figure><artwork>
  00 -- Index Header Group
  01 -- Index Range Header Group
  10 -- Cloned Index Header Group
  11 -- Literal Header Group
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>The Cloned Index (10) and Literal (11) header group types have an additional
      "ephemeral" property that indicates whether or not the group affects the 
      compression state. </t>

      <t>Each header group contains a single 8-bit prefix and up to 32 distinct header 
      instances. </t>

    <section title="Header Group Prefix">
      
      <t>The Header Group Prefix is a single octet that provides three distinct 
      pieces of information:</t>

      <figure><artwork>
  00 0 00000
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>The first two most significant bits of the header group prefix identify the 
      group type.</t> 

      <t>The next bit is the "ephemeral flag" and is used only for Cloned
      and Literal group types. This bit indicates whether or not the group alters
      the stored compression state.</t>

      <t>The remaining five bits specify the number of header instances in the group, 
      with 00000 indicating that the group contains 1 instance and 11111 contains 32. 
      A header group MUST contain at least one instance.</t>

      <t>The remaining serialization of the header group depends entirely on the 
      group type.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="Index Header Group">
      
      <t>The serialization of the Index Header Group consists of the Header Group Prefix
      and up to 32 additional octets, each referencing a single 8-bit storage index
      identifier for items in either the Static or Dynamic Cache.</t>

      <figure><preamble>For instance</preamble><artwork>
  00000000 00000000 = References item #0 from 
                      the dynamic cache

  00000001 00000000 10000000 = References item #0 from the 
                               dynamic cache and item #0 
                               from the static cache
      </artwork></figure>
                              
      <t>Index Header Groups do not affect the stored compression state. If an Index
      Header Group references a header index that has not yet been allocated, the 
      deserialization MUST terminate with an error. This likely means that the 
      compression state has become out of sync and needs to be reestablished.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="Index Range Header Group">
      
      <t>The serialization of the Index Range Header Group consists of the Header Group 
      Prefix and up to 32 additional 2-octet (16 bits) pairs of 8-bit storage index
      identifiers. Each pair specifies a sequential range of adjacent ranges. </t>

      <figure><preamble>For instance:</preamble><artwork>
  01000000 00000000 00000100 = References items #0-#4 from 
                               the dynamic cache.
                               (five distinct items total)
       </artwork></figure>

       <t>A range MAY span dynamic and static index values. Index values are treated
       as unsigned byte values, so indices from the static cache are numerically 
       greater than dynamic cache values.. e.g.</t>
 
       <figure><artwork>
  01000000 01111111 10000001 = References item #127 from the 
                               dynamic cache, and items #0 
                               and #1 from the static cache.
       </artwork></figure>

      <t>Index Range Header Groups do not affect the stored compression state. If a 
      range references a header index that has not yet been allocated, the
      deserialization MUST terminate with an error. This likely means that the 
      compression state has become out of sync and needs to be reestablished.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="Cloned Index Header Group">
      
      <t>The serialization of the Cloned Index Header Group consists of the Header Group
      Prefix and up to 32 Index+Value pairs. Each Index+Value pair consists of a
      leading 8-bit storage index of an existing stored header followed by a new
      serialized value. The serialization of the value depends on the value type
      (see discussion of Value serialization below).</t>

      <t>The Cloned Header Group affects the stored compression state if, and only if,
      the "ephemeral" flag in the Header Group Prefix is NOT set. If the header 
      group is not marked as being ephemeral, then the specified value is stored in
      the next available storage index using the key name from the referenced storage
      index.</t>

      <t>For instance, assume the dynamic cache currently contains an item at index #1 
      with key name "foo" and value "bar", the following causes a new item to be 
      added to the storage with key name "foo" and value "baz":</t>

      <figure><artwork>
  10000000 00000001 00000000 00000100 
  10111000 01001111 10110101 00100000
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>An explanation of the value syntax is given a bit later.</t>

      <t>If a Cloned Header Group references a header index that has not yet been 
      allocated, the deserialization MUST terminate with an error. This likely 
      means that the compression state has become out of sync and needs to be
      reestablished.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="Literal Header Group">
      
      <t>The serialization of the Literal Header Group consists of the Header Group
      Prefix and up to 32 Name+Value pairs. Each Name+Value pair consists of a 
      length-prefixed sequence of ASCII bytes specifying the Header Name
      followed by the serialized value. The serialization of the value depends 
      on the value type. The length prefix is encoded as an unsigned variable
      length integer (uvarint). The length prefix SHOULD NOT be longer than five
      octets and SHOULD NOT specify a value larger than 0xFFFF. </t>

      <t>The Literal Heaer Group affects the stored compression state if, and only if,
      the "ephemeral" flag in the Header Group Prefix is NOT set. If the header
      group is not marked as being ephemeral, then the specified key name and value
      is stored in the next available storage index.</t>

      <figure><preamble>For instance:</preamble><artwork>
  11000000 00000011 01100110 01101111
  01101111 00000000 00000010 10111000
  01000100 11010010
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>Stores a new header with name "foo" and value "baz" in the dynamic cache.</t>

      <t>Each Header Group consists of up to 32 distinct Header Instances. If a 
      particular serialization block contains more than 32 intances of a given 
      type, then multiple instances of the Header Group Type can be included in 
      the serialized block. For instance, if a given message contains 33 index 
      references, the serialized block may contain two separate Index Header Groups.
      While this is allowed, it is expected to be rare.</t>

        <t>All UTF-8 text values are compressed using a modified static huffman code.
        "Modified" because the encoded version may contain compact-representations 
        of raw, arbitrary UTF-8 bytes that are not covered by the static huffman
        code table.</t>

        <t>There are two huffman tables in use, one for HTTP Requests and another for 
        HTTP Responses, each covers UTF-8 codepoints strictly less than 128 as well
        the fifty possible UTF-8 leading octets.</t>

        <t>The encoded result MUST end with a specific terminal sequence of bits 
        called the "HUFFMAN_EOF". Currently, the HUFFMAN_EOF is the same for both
        the Request and Response tables, but that could change if the tables are 
        regenerated. Currently, the HUFFMAN_EOF sequence is 101001.</t>

        <t>Codepoints >= 128 are handled by first taking the leading octet of the UTF-8 
        representation and serializing it's associated huffman code from the table
        to the output stream, then, depending on the octets value, serializing the 
        six least significant bits from each of the remaining trailing octets.</t>

        <t>For instance, the UTF-8 character U+00D4 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH 
        CIRCUMFLEX), with UTF-8 representation of C394 (hex) is encoded as:</t>

        <figure><artwork>
  11000100 01010010 10010000
        </artwork></figure>

        <t>The first 8-bits represents the huffman-table prefix, the first six most 
        significant bytes of the second octet are taken directly from the six least
        significant bits of the second UTF-8 byte (0x94). Following those six bits 
        are the six bits of the HUFFMAN_EOF 101001, followed by four unset padding 
        bits.</t>

        <t>The number of raw UTF-8 bits to write depends on the value of the leading
        octet. If the value is between 0xC2 and 0xDF (inclusive), six bits from the 
        second continuation byte is encoded. If the value is between 0xE0 and 0xEF
        (inclusive), six bits from the second and third continuation bytes are 
        encoded. If the value is between 0xF0 and 0xF4 (inclusive), six bits from 
        the second, third and fourth continuation bytes are encoded. UTF-8 codepoints
        that require greater than four bytes to encode cannot be represented.</t>

    <section title="Updated Standard Header Definitions">
      
      <t>In order to properly deal with the backwards compatibility concerns
      for HTTP/1, there are several important rules for use of Typed Codecs
      in HTTP headers:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>All header fields MUST be explicitly defined to use the new header 
          types. All existing HTTP/1 header fields, then, will continue to be
          represented as ISO-8859-1 Text unless their standard definitions are
          updated. The HTTP/2 specification would update the definition of
          specific known header fields (e.g. content-length, date, if-modified-since,
          etc).</t>
        <t>Extension header fields that use the typed codecs will have specific
          normative transformations to ISO-8859-1 defined.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>UTF-8 Text will be converted to ISO-8859-1 with extended
               characters pct-encoded</t>
            <t>Numbers will be converted to their ASCII equivalent values.</t>
            <t>Date Times will be converted to their HTTP-Date equivalent values.</t>
            <t>Binary fields will be Base64-encoded.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>There will be no normative transformation from ISO-8859-1 values
        into the typed codecs. Implementations are free to apply
        transformation where those impls determine it is appropriate, but it
        will be perfectly legal for an implementation to pass a text value
        through even if it is known that a given header type has a typed codec
        equivalent (for instance, Content-Length may come through as a number
        or a text value, either will be valid). This means that when
        translating from HTTP/1 -> HTTP/2, receiving implementations need to
        be prepared to handle either value form.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>A Note of warning: Individual header fields MAY be defined such 
        that they can be represented using multiple types. Numeric fields, 
        for instance, can be represented using either the uvarint encoding 
        or using the equivalent sequence of ASCII numbers. Implementers will 
        need to be capable of supporting each of the possible variations. 
        Designers of header field definitions need to be aware of the 
        additional complexity and possible issues that allowing for 
        such alternatives can introduce for implementers.</t>
      
      <t>Based on an initial survey of header fields currently defined by
        the HTTPbis specification documents, the following header field 
        definitions can be updated to make use of the new types</t>

    <section title="State Management Alternatives">
      
      <t>In the current design, dynamic cache storage slots are assigned
        by the decompressor in "encounter order". While this is effective,
        it requires that all compressor and decompressor implementations 
        utilize the exact same algorithm for assigning storage slots, 
        precluding any implementation from experimenting with more efficient
        algorithms. An alternative approach is to allow the compressor
        to assign the slots and communicate the assigned slots with each
        header. This would require a single additional byte per header 
        instance in the Literal and Cloned Header Groups.</t>
        
      <t>The serialization syntax for Cloned and Literal Header Groups
        would change to:</t>
        
        <figure><artwork>
  ; Cloned-Index Header Group
  cloned-index-header-group  = cloned-index-header-prefix 
                               1*32(cache-index cache-index value)

  ; Literal Header Group
  literal-header-group       = literal-header-prefix 
                               1*32(cache-index name value)
        </artwork></figure>
      
        <t>The decompressor would used the specified storage index 
          locations to store header values rather than relying on 
          the encounter order, increasing the general efficiency of
          the algorithm with a minimal impact on transmission size.</t>
          
        <t>On the downside, this puts the compressor in greater 
          control over the decompressor-maintained state because the 
          decompressor would not know how long it needs to hold 
          on to stored items. This opens the decompressor up to
          possible abuse from malicious compressors. The current 
          least-recently-written cache approach allows the decompressor
          to reliably drop items as space fills without fear of 
          falling out of sync with the compressor.</t>

    <section title="Alternative Timestamp encodings">
      
      <t>This specification currently uses the number of milliseconds from
        the UNIX Epoch to represent timestamps. This 64-bit number is encoded
        using the same uvarint encoding as Numeric fields. This means that 
        the timestamp is encoded using a variable width that, right now
        (for about the next 100 years or so), will encode in six bytes, 
        then seven bytes for the reasonable future.</t>
        
      <t>One possible alternative approach we can take is similar to 
        NTP's handling of Era's. We can take the current timestamp
        and generate an Era value, with a maximum of 255 (0xFF). This
        is used as a multiplier for the timestamp value. The two 
        values are calculated using the following formula:</t>
        
        <figure><artwork>
 m   = 4294967296000
 now = milliseconds since UNIX Epoch
 era = now / m
 ts  = now % m
        </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>The allowable values for "era" would be capped at 255. This value 
        is encoded as a single byte, followed by a uvarint encoding of
        ts. This ensures that the timestamp will never be encoded using
        more than 7-bytes total, though it may be encoded in as few as 
        two bytes on extremely rare occasions (specifically, immediately
        following each era rollover).</t>
        
      <figure><preamble>Wire Syntax:</preamble><artwork>
  era       = %x00-FF
  ts        = uvarint
  date-time = era ts
      </artwork></figure>
        
      <t>To convert back to the Epoch, the formula is equally simple:</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
  now = era * m + ts
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>The largest date we can encode using this format is 
       "36812-02-20T00:36:15.999Z". Dates prior to the epoch 
       cannot be represented.</t>
      
      <t>The significant drawback with this approach is that current dates
      would encode in 7-bytes until the next era rollover, which will 
      occur at approximately 2106-02-07T06:28:15.999Z (give or take a 
      few leap seconds thrown in here and there).</t>
      
      <t>Note: The byte lengths assume we want millisecond precision. 
        If we opted to keep the second precision currently in HTTP/1, 
        then this alternative encoding ensures that our timestamps 
        never exceed six-bytes in length.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="Alternative uvarint encodings">
      
      <t>The uvarint encoding currently specified by this specification is 
        certainly not the only possible option we can use. I chose it 
        simply because it is drop dead simple to implement. There are 
        quite a few other approaches we can take, each of which can be
        used as drop-in replacements for the current approach. Below are 
        just a couple alternatives. There are plenty others. We just need
        to pick the one that we feel will work the best.</t>
        
      <t>It ought to be noted that while each of these schemes vary 
        in details such as endianess, specific wire-format, etc, each
        will typically encode the same numbers using the same number
        of bytes with variations of only a single byte only in the edge 
        cases. Processing time for each is also equivalent when dealing
        with any number less or equal to 64-bits in length. This means
        that the choice is largely a matter of style than substance.</t>
      
      <section title="Option 1:">
        
        <t>With this option, leading bits are used to indicate the total 
          number of bytes used to encode the number value, with no fixed
          upper limit. Values strictly less than 128 are encoded using a 
          single byte.</t>

          <t>The number of leading 1 bits specify the number of additional
          bytes used to serialize the value. A single 0 bit is used to mark
          the end of this prefix, the remaining bits are used to encode the 
          minimum bits necessary to encode the value (with appropriate leading
          0 bits to ensure proper byte-alignment).</t>

          <t>For instance, the integer value 500, which is represented in 
            binary as 00000001 11110100, can be encoded using two bytes, 
            10000001 11110100</t>
            
          <t>The integer value 9770098, which is represented in 
            binary as 10010101 00010100 01110010, can be encoded using four 
            bytes: 11100000 10010101 00010100 01110010</t>

         exception of being capped at a maximum of nine encoded octets
         total. Rather than growing indefinitely, the encoded value 
         must never require more then eight continuation bytes to 
         encode. Because of this restriction, there is no need for a
         trailing 0-bit spilling over past the first leading byte.</t>

          <t>The number of leading 1 bits specify the number of additional
          bytes used to serialize the value. If the number of bytes required
          is less than 8, a single 0 bit is used to mark the end of this prefix, 
          the remaining bits are used to encode the minimum bits necessary to 
          encode the value (with appropriate leading 0 bits to ensure proper 
          byte-alignment).</t>

          <t>For instance, the integer value 500, which is represented in 
            binary as 00000001 11110100, can be encoded using two bytes, 
            10000001 11110100</t>
            
          <t>The integer value 9770098, which is represented in 
            binary as 10010101 00010100 01110010, can be encoded using four 
            bytes: 11100000 10010101 00010100 01110010</t>

          <t>This format is not capable of encoding any number requiring more 
            than 64-bits.</t>

    <section title="Set-Cookie and Cookie Alternatives">
      
      <t>The Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are interesting in that they
        establish a subordinate layer of key+value pairs exchanged within an
        HTTP dialog. Up to this point, Cookies have been handled largely as
        blobs of text, which is generally inefficient and inflexible. Even 
        though it works, the design is not optimum.</t>
        
      <t>The introduction of a new header serialization mechanism and HTTP/2's
        new framing provides us with an interesting opportunity to make 
        significant improvements to the way cookies work.</t>
        
      <t>Consider, for example, rather than defining Set-Cookie as a header
        field, we could create a modified Headers Frame that contains 
        header fields that ought to be persisted and returned by the client.</t>
        
      <t>The new Headers Frame flags would be:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>P (0x1)  - Persist. If set, the headers in this frame are to be 
            persistently stored and returned in subsequent streams.</t>
          <t>C (0x2)  - Clear. If set, any existing stored state is cleared.</t>
          <t>E (0x4)  - Ephemeral. If set, state is only stored for the duration of
            this connection.</t>
          <t>H (0x8)  - HttpOnly. Equivalent to Set-Cookie HttpOnly parameter.</t>
          <t>S (0x10) - Secure. Equivalent to Set-Cookie Secure parameter.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>These flags would pertain only to the header fields contained by the 
        one Headers frame.</t>

       <t>Within the header block, similar to how special ':' prefixed 
        HTTP header fields are handled, there would be a handful of 
        special ':' fields:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>:host    - text, equivalent to the Set-Cookie domain parameter</t>
          <t>:path    - text, equivalent to the Set-Cookie path parameter</t>
          <t>:expires - timestamp or text</t>
          <t>:max-age - uvarint or text</t>
        </list>
      </t> 

      <t>When the Server wishes to send Cookies to the client, rather than 
        sending a separate Set-Cookie header for every individual name+value
        pair it wishes the client to persist, it would send a Stateful Header
        Frame. The client would receive this, persist the contained set of 
        name+value pairs just as it would persist cookies today, then return
        those to the server in a separate Headers Frame in all appropriate
        subsequent streams.</t>

      <t>This approach has a number of distinct advantages of the current
        Set-Cookies mechanism:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Currently, handling Set-Cookie requires it's own separate 
            parsing logic. With this new approach, we would leverage the 
            same header block encoding as all other types of headers,
            without the need for problematic and error-prone text parsing
            logic.</t>
          <t>Currently, the Set-Cookie Expires and Max-Age parameters use
            inefficient ASCII encodings, with this new approach, those 
            fields are encoded using efficient variable-length encodings
            and allow multiple key+value pairs to be stored with the same
            expiration to eliminate redundancy.</t>
          <t>Currently, cookie values are limited to a specific ASCII subset.
            With this new approach, Cookie values can take advantage of the 
            exact same value type codecs described in this document. Cookie
            values could be text, numeric, timestamps or raw binary, providing
            significant new options.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
   
      <t>For example, suppose the server wishes the client to store two cookies
      for 10 seconds with the HttpOnly and Secure flags set. The server wishes
      the client to also clear any previous cookies it had stored. To accomplish 
      this, the server would send a Stateful Headers Frame to the client with 
      bit flags P, C, H and S set to 1 and the following key-value pairs encoded 
      in the serialized header block:</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
 :host    = "example.com"
 :path    = "/" 
 :max-age = 10
 foo      = "bar"
 baz      = 123
      </artwork></figure> 

      <t>Upon creating a new streams for the domain "example.com" and path "/",
        the client would include the "foo" and "baz" header fields in the set of 
        headers encoded in the request:</t>
        
        <figure><artwork>
 :method = GET
 :path   = "/foo"
 :host   = "example.com"
 foo     = "bar"
 baz     = 123
        </artwork></figure>
        
        <t>Note that this approach is backwards compatible with Set-Cookie
          and Cookie in that those header fields could continue to be used
          by existing implementations.</t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction"> 

    <t>
      This specification updates the HTTP LINK and UNLINK methods originally
      defined in <xref target="RFC2068"/>.
    </t>
  
    <t>
      In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", 
      "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
      are to be  interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
    </t> 

  </section> 
  
  <section title="Link Relationships" anchor="model">
    
    <t>
      The LINK and UNLINK methods are used to manage relationships 
      between resources. Those relationships are defined using the Link
      model established in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC5988" />. For 
      every individual link, the context IRI, link relation type, target 
      IRI, and optional collection of target attributes MUST be considered; 
      that is, for any effective request URI, there can exist at most one Link 
      relationship between any context and target IRI pairing with any given 
      combination of link relation type and target attributes.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      Within LINK and UNLINK requests, a <xref target="RFC5988"/> Link 
      header field is used to describe a Link relationship to be 
      managed. Any single LINK or UNLINK request MAY contain multiple Link
      header fields, each of which describes a separate relationship between
      a context IRI and target IRI. When a LINK request contains multiple 
      Link header fields, the server MUST create all of the specified relationships
      or not create any of them. Likewise, when an UNLINK request contains
      multiple Link header fields, the server MUST either remove all the 
      specified relationship or not remove any of them.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      The target and context IRIs of a Link relationship are determined 
      following the requirements specified in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of 
      <xref target="RFC5988"/>.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      When determining whether or not a relationship already exists between
      a context IRI and target IRI, implementations will need to compare the 
      given IRIs with other, previously established relationships. To do so,
      the implementation MUST first resolve the IRIs as required by 
      <xref target="RFC5988" /> and then compare on a case-sensitive, 
      character-by-character basis. For instance, the IRIs 
      "http://example.org/foo" and "http://example.org/Foo" MUST NOT be 
      considered to be equivalent.
    </t>
    
  </section>
  
  <section title="LINK" anchor="link">
  
    <t>
      The LINK method is used to establish one or more relationships between
      the resource identified by the effective request URI and one or more other 
      resources. Metadata contained within Link header fields <xref target="RFC5988"/>
      provide information about the relationships being established. A payload 
      within a LINK request has no defined semantics.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      LINK requests are idempotent but are not safe. Establishing a 
      relationship causes an inherent change to the state of the target 
      resource.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      Any successful response (using a 2xx status code) to a LINK request
      indicates that all of the Link relationships described in the request
      have been established. No specific 2xx status code is required. 
    </t>

    <t>
      Responses to LINK requests SHOULD contain one Link header field
      for each Link relationship established by the LINK request.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      Responses to LINK requests are not cacheable. If a LINK request passes 
      through a cache that has one or more stored responses for the effective 
      request URI, those stored responses will be invalidated (see Section 6 
      of <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache"/>).
    </t>

    <t>
      The semantics of the LINK method change to a "conditional LINK" if
      the request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-
      Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field
      (<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional"/>).  A conditional 
      LINK requests that the relationship be established only under the 
      circumstances described by the conditional header field(s).
    </t>
    
  </section>
  
  <section title="UNLINK" anchor="unlink">
  
    <t>
      The UNLINK method is used to remove one or more relationships
      between the resource identified by the effective request URI and 
      other resources. Metadata contained within Link header fields 
      <xref target="RFC5988"/> provide the information about the 
      relationships that are to be removed. A payload within an UNLINK request 
      has no defined semantics.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      UNLINK request messages are idempotent but are not safe. Removing a 
      relationship causes an inherent change to the state of the target 
      resource.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      Responses to UNLINK requests SHOULD contain one Link header field
      for each Link relationship removed by the UNLINK request.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      Any successful response (using a 2xx status code) to an UNLINK request
      indicates that all of the Link relationships described in the request
      have been removed. No specific 2xx status code is required. 
    </t>
    
    <t>
      Responses to UNLINK requests are not cacheable. If an UNLINK
      request passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses
      for the effective request URI, those stored responses will be
      invalidated (see Section 6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache"/>).
    </t>

    <t>
      The semantics of the UNLINK method change to a "conditional UNLINK" if
      the request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-
      Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field
      (<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional"/>).  A conditional 
      UNLINK requests that the relationship be established only under the 
      circumstances described by the conditional header field(s).
    </t>

  </section>

  <section title="Relationship to other HTTP Methods and Discoverability of Links">
    
    <t>
      The use of the LINK and UNLINK request methods to manage relationships 
      between resources has no direct bearing on the use or appearance of Link 
      header fields within any other HTTP request or response message 
      involving the same effective request URI. Nor do the methods have any 
      direct normative impact on the use of link-like structures within the resource
      representations returned by a server for any particular resource.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      Whether and how to represent relationships managed using LINK 
      and UNLINK is left solely at the discretion of the server implementation.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      This specification does not define a means of discovering or 
      enumerating the relationships that have been established using the 
      LINK request method.
    </t>
    
  </section>

  <section title="Example" anchor="example">
  
    <t>There exists a broad range of possible use cases for the LINK and UNLINK
    methods. The examples that follow illustrate a subset of those cases.</t>

     the IRIs "acct:joe@example.org" and "acct:sally@example.org")</preamble>
     <artwork><![CDATA[

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
      The LINK and UNLINK methods are subject to the same general security 
      considerations as all HTTP methods as described in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics"/>.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      Because the LINK and UNLINK methods cause changes to a resource's state, 
      the server is responsible for determining the client's authorization to 
      make such changes.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="IANA Considerations">
    
    <t>
      IANA is requested to add the LINK and UNLINK methods to the 
      permanent registry at &lt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods&gt;
      (see Section 8.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics" />).

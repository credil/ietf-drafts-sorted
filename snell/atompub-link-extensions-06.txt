Internet-Draft            Atom Link Extensions                 June 2010


1.  Introduction

   This specification adds additional attribute to the Atom Syndication
   Format [RFC4287] link and content elements that may be used to
   express additional metadata about linked resources.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

    "atom": "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"


3.  Hash Attributes

3.1.  Computing Hash Digests

   When the resource referenced by atom:link or atom:content elements is
   retrievable using HTTP, hash digest values are computed by first
   performing an HTTP GET request on the URL specified by the @href or
   @src attributes, extracting the returned entity-body, then following
   the steps specified in Section 14.15 of [RFC2616].

   It should be noted, however, that there are a variety of factors that
   influence whether the entity-body returned by the HTTP GET will yield
   a hash digest value matching that specified by a hash attribute
   contained by the atom:link or atom:content elements.  Accordingly,
   hash attribute values MUST be considered to be strictly advisory and
   cannot be used reliably as an end-to-end integrity check.

3.2.  The 'hash' attributes

   The 'hash' Attribute specifies a whitespace-delimited list of hash
   digest values calculated over the resource identified by the atom:
   link/@href or atom:content/@src attributes.  Each digest value is
   represented as a token identifying the hash algorithm and the hex-
   encoded digest separated by an ASCII colon (":").  The 'hash'
   attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:content
   elements.

Internet-Draft            Atom Link Extensions                 June 2010


     hash = attribute hash { digest-list }
     digest-value = token ":" 1*HEXDIG
     digest-list = digest-value *( LWSP digest-value )

   An example MD5 and SHA-256 digests of an enclosed MP3 file:

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       hash="md5:9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6
             sha-256:6bf05cbbde96d6...d5ffe91e29272d805c98b988dc" />

   This specification defines the following hash algorithm tokens:
   "md2", "md5", "sha-1", "sha-224", "sha-256", "sha-384", and "sha-
   512".  Additional hash algorithms MAY be used.


4.  The 'etag' attribute

   The 'etag' Attribute specifies an Entity Tag [RFC2616] for the
   resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element as
   provided by the server hosting the resource.  The 'etag' attribute
   MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:content elements.

     etag = attribute le:etag { entity-tag }

     entity-tag = [ weak ] opaque-tag
     weak       = "W/"
     opaque-tag = quoted-string

   An example weak entity tag for an enclosed MP3 file:

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
        href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
        etag='W/"xyzzy"' />

   Note that HTTP defines the Entity Tag production such that quotes are
   significant.  For example, the values "W/xyzzy" and W/"xyzzy"
   represent two distinctly different Entity Tags, the former being
   considered a "strong" entity tag, the latter a "weak" entity tag.
   The etag attribute value MUST include the appropriate double
   quotation marks.

   The presence and placement of the quotes in the entity tag value can
   introduce some difficulty when inserting the value into the etag
   attribute.  Producers of Atom documents must either use single quotes
   when specifying the value of the etag attribute, e.g.
   etag='W/"xyzzy"' or use the &quot; entity reference to escape the
   double quotes within the etag value, e.g. etag="W/&quot;xyzzy&quot;".

Internet-Draft            Atom Link Extensions                 June 2010


   A strong entity tag would be encoded as either etag='"xyzzy"' or
   etag="&quot;xyzzy&quot;".


5.  The 'modified' attribute

   The 'modified' Attribute specifies the date and time when the
   resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element was last
   modified.  The value MUST conform to the "date-time" production
   defined by [RFC3339].  An uppercase "T" character MUST be used to
   separate date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character MUST be
   present in the absence of a numeric time zone offset.  The 'modified'
   attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:content
   elements.

     modified = attribute modified { xsd:dateTime }

   An example last-modified attribute for an enclosed MP3 file:

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       modified="2010-12-12T12:12:12Z" />


6.  The 'accessed' attribute

   The 'accessed' Attribute specifies the most recent date and time when
   the resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element was
   accessed.  The value MUST conform to the "date-time" production
   defined by [RFC3339].  An uppercase "T" character MUST be used to
   separate date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character MUST be
   present in the absence of a numeric time zone offset.  The 'accessed'
   attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:content
   elements.

     accessed = attribute accessed { xsd:dateTime }

   An example accessed attribute for an enclosed MP3 file:

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       accessed="2010-12-12T12:12:12Z" />


7.  The 'media' attribute

   The 'media' attribute identifies the optimum media for the resource
   identified by the atom:link/@href attribute.  The value MUST be a

   valid media query as specified by the Media Queries Specification
   [W3C.CR-css3-mediaqueries-20090915].  The media attribute MUST be
   considered to be purely advisory and identifies for which type of
   media the resource in question was designed.  The 'media' attribute
   MAY appear as a child of the atom:link element.

     media = attribute media { media-query }

   An example media attribute on an atom:link element:

     <atom:link rel="alternate"
       href="http://example.org/media/index.html"
       media="handheld and (min-width: 20em)" />

   Section 4.1.2 of the Atom specification [RFC4287] limits the ability
   for an atom:entry to contain multiple atom:link elements with a rel
   attribute value of "alternate".  Specifically, the specification
   states that an atom:entry "MUST NOT contain more than one atom:link
   element with a rel attribute value of "alternate" that has the same
   combination of type and hreflang attribute values."  This restriction
   limits the ability of an Atom document publisher to provide multiple
   media-targeted alternate links of the same content type.  Each
   alternate link MUST specify a different media type or language.
   Other types of links do not share the same limitation.


8.  Security Considerations

   The 'hash', 'etag' and 'modified' attributes are intended to allow an
   Atom publisher the means of describing the state of a linked resource
   at a point-in-time -- usually at the moment specified by the
   'accessed' attribute or at the moment the atom:link or atom:content
   element was created.  An Atom consumer that is aware of these
   attributes can use their values as an integrity check to determine if
   the linked resource has been modified since the attribute values were
   established by the publisher.

   The 'hash' attribute is intended for use when the publisher of an
   Atom document requires the ability to link to a specific version of a
   resource that is expected to remain stable and unchanged for a useful
   period of time.  If publishers fall into the habit of regularly
   including hash digests for resources whose states change frequently,
   there is a danger that consumers of feeds containing large numbers of
   invalid digests will simply begin to ignore them and completely
   undermine the utility of the attribute.

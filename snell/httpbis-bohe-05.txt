1.  Stored Header Encoding

   The Stored Header Encoding is an alternative "binary header encoding"
   for HTTP/2.0 that combines the best elements from three other
   proposed encodings, including:

   o  The "Header Delta Compression" scheme proposed by Roberto Peon in
      http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rpeon-httpbis-header-
      compression-03

   o  The "Header Diff" encoding proposed by Herve Reullan, Jun
      Fujisawa, Romain Bellessort, and Youenn Fablet in http://
      tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ruellan-headerdiff-00

   o  The "Binary Optimized Header Encoding" proposed by James Snell
      (me) in http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-httpbis-bohe-03

   The Stored Header Encoding seeks to find an elegant, efficient and
   simple marriage of the best concepts from each of these separate
   proposals.

2.  State Model

   The compressor and decompressor each maintain a cache of header value
   pairs.  There is a static cache, prepopulated by the specification,
   and a dynamic cache, populated through the compression and
   decompression process.  Each cache contains a maximum of 128
   individual key+value pairs.



Snell                   Expires October 22, 2013                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft           Stored Header Encoding               April 2013


   Each item in the index is referenced by an 8-bit identifier.  The
   most significant bit identifies whether an item from the static or
   dynamic cache is being referenced.  Note: the Nil byte (0x00) is a
   valid identifier for the dynamic cache.

   0xxxxxxx  --  Dynamic Cache
   1xxxxxxx  --  Static Cache


   The dynamic cache is managed in a "least recently written" style,
   that is, as the cache fills to capacity in both number of entries and
   maximum stored byte size, the least recently written items are
   dropped and those index positions are reused.

   Index positions from the dynamic cache are assigned in "encounter
   order", beginning from 0x00 and increasing monotonically to 0x7F.
   That is to say, the positions are assigned in precisely the same
   order that they are serialized, and thereby encountered by the
   decompressor upon reading and processing the block.

   Each item in the store consists of a Header Name and a Value.  The
   Name is a lower-case ISO-8859-1 character sequence.  The Value is
   either a UTF-8 string, a number, a Timestamp or an arbitrary sequence
   of binary octets.

   The available size of the stored compression state can be capped by
   the decompressor.  Each stored value contributes to the accumulated
   size of the storage state.  As new key+value pairs are assigned
   positions in the dynamic cache, the least-recently assigned items
   must be removed if necessary to free up the required space.

   The size of string values is measured by the number of UTF-8 bytes
   required for the character sequence.

   The size of number and timestamp values are measured by the number of
   unsigned variable length integer (uvarint) encoded bytes it takes to
   represent the value (see the section of value types below).

   The size of raw binary values is measured by the number of octets.

   Header names DO NOT contribute to the stored state size of the
   compressor; only the size of the value is considered.  Duplicate
   values MUST be counted individually.

3.  Header Serialization

   Headers are serialized into four typed header groups, each
   represented by a two-bit identifier.  These groups are serialized



Snell                   Expires October 22, 2013                [Page 3]

   sequentially.  A serialized header block can contain, at most 256
   header groups.  The first byte of the serialized block is an
   unsigned, 0-based counter indicating the number of groups.  A
   serialized block MUST contain at least one header group.

   00 -- Index Header Group
   01 -- Index Range Header Group
   10 -- Cloned Index Header Group
   11 -- Literal Header Group


   The Cloned Index (10) and Literal (11) header group types have an
   additional "ephemeral" property that indicates whether or not the
   group affects the compression state.

   Each header group contains a single 8-bit prefix and up to 32
   distinct header instances.

3.1.  Header Group Prefix

   The Header Group Prefix is a single octet that provides three
   distinct pieces of information:

   00 0 00000


   The first two most significant bits of the header group prefix
   identify the group type.

   The next bit is the "ephemeral flag" and is used only for Cloned and
   Literal group types.  This bit indicates whether or not the group
   alters the stored compression state.

   The remaining five bits specify the number of header instances in the
   group, with 00000 indicating that the group contains 1 instance and
   11111 contains 32.  A header group MUST contain at least one
   instance.

   The remaining serialization of the header group depends entirely on
   the group type.

3.2.  Index Header Group

   The serialization of the Index Header Group consists of the Header
   Group Prefix and up to 32 additional octets, each referencing a
   single 8-bit storage index identifier for items in either the Static
   or Dynamic Cache.

   For instance




Snell                   Expires October 22, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Stored Header Encoding               April 2013


     00000000 00000000 = References item #0 from
                         the dynamic cache

     00000001 00000000 10000000 = References item #0 from the
                                  dynamic cache and item #0
                                  from the static cache


   Index Header Groups do not affect the stored compression state.  If
   an Index Header Group references a header index that has not yet been
   allocated, the deserialization MUST terminate with an error.  This
   likely means that the compression state has become out of sync and
   needs to be reestablished.

3.3.  Index Range Header Group

   The serialization of the Index Range Header Group consists of the
   Header Group Prefix and up to 32 additional 2-octet (16 bits) pairs
   of 8-bit storage index identifiers.  Each pair specifies a sequential
   range of adjacent ranges.

   For instance:

   01000000 00000000 00000100 = References items #0-#4 from
                                the dynamic cache.
                                (five distinct items total)


   A range MAY span dynamic and static index values.  Index values are
   treated as unsigned byte values, so indices from the static cache are
   numerically greater than dynamic cache values.. e.g.

   01000000 01111111 10000001 = References item #127 from the
                                dynamic cache, and items #0
                                and #1 from the static cache.


   Index Range Header Groups do not affect the stored compression state.
   If a range references a header index that has not yet been allocated,
   the deserialization MUST terminate with an error.  This likely means
   that the compression state has become out of sync and needs to be
   reestablished.

3.4.  Cloned Index Header Group

   The serialization of the Cloned Index Header Group consists of the
   Header Group Prefix and up to 32 Index+Value pairs.  Each Index+Value
   pair consists of a leading 8-bit storage index of an existing stored
   header followed by a new serialized value.  The serialization of the
   value depends on the value type (see discussion of Value
   serialization below).

   The Cloned Header Group affects the stored compression state if, and
   only if, the "ephemeral" flag in the Header Group Prefix is NOT set.
   If the header group is not marked as being ephemeral, then the
   specified value is stored in the next available storage index using
   the key name from the referenced storage index.

   For instance, assume the dynamic cache currently contains an item at
   index #1 with key name "foo" and value "bar", the following causes a
   new item to be added to the storage with key name "foo" and value
   "baz":

   10000000 00000001 00000000 00000100
   10111000 01001111 10110101 00100000


   An explanation of the value syntax is given a bit later.

   If a Cloned Header Group references a header index that has not yet
   been allocated, the deserialization MUST terminate with an error.
   This likely means that the compression state has become out of sync
   and needs to be reestablished.

3.5.  Literal Header Group

   The serialization of the Literal Header Group consists of the Header
   Group Prefix and up to 32 Name+Value pairs.  Each Name+Value pair
   consists of a length-prefixed sequence of ASCII bytes specifying the
   Header Name followed by the serialized value.  The serialization of
   the value depends on the value type.  The length prefix is encoded as
   an unsigned variable length integer (uvarint).  The length prefix
   SHOULD NOT be longer than five octets and SHOULD NOT specify a value
   larger than 0xFFFF.

   The Literal Heaer Group affects the stored compression state if, and
   only if, the "ephemeral" flag in the Header Group Prefix is NOT set.
   If the header group is not marked as being ephemeral, then the
   specified key name and value is stored in the next available storage
   index.

Internet-Draft           Stored Header Encoding               April 2013


   For instance:

   11000000 00000011 01100110 01101111
   01101111 00000000 00000010 10111000
   01000100 11010010


   Stores a new header with name "foo" and value "baz" in the dynamic
   cache.

   Each Header Group consists of up to 32 distinct Header Instances.  If
   a particular serialization block contains more than 32 intances of a
   given type, then multiple instances of the Header Group Type can be
   included in the serialized block.  For instance, if a given message
   contains 33 index references, the serialized block may contain two
   separate Index Header Groups.  While this is allowed, it is expected
   to be rare.

4.  Header Values

   Header Values can be one of four types, each identified by a two-bit
   identifier.

   o  00 -- UTF-8 Text

   o  01 -- Numeric

   o  10 -- Timetamp

   o  11 -- Raw Binary Octets

   An individual value MAY consist of up to 32 distinct discreet "value
   instances".  A value with multiple instances is considered, for all
   intensive purposes, to be a single value.

   Each serialized value is preceded by an 8-bit Value Prefix.

   00 0 00000


   The first two most significant bits specifies the value type.

   The third significant bit is a reserved flag.  Future iterations of
   this specification might make use of this bit.

Internet-Draft           Stored Header Encoding               April 2013


   The final five least-significant bits specify the number of discreet
   instances in the value.  00000 indicates that one instance is
   included, 11111 indicates that 32 instances are included.  The value
   MUST contain at least one instance.

   The remaining serialization depends entirely on the type.

4.1.  UTF-8 Text Values

   UTF-8 Text is encoded as a length-prefixed sequence of Huffman-
   encoded UTF-8 octets.  The length prefix is encoded as an unsigned
   variable-length integer specifying the number of octets after
   applying the Huffman-encoding.

4.2.  Numeric Values

   Numeric values are encoded as unsigned variable-length integers
   (uvarint) of up to a maximum of 10-octets.  Unsigned values larger
   than 64-bits (0xFFFFFFFF) MUST NOT be used.  Negative values cannot
   be represented using this syntax.  The uvarint syntax is described
   below.

4.3.  Timestamp Values

   Timestamp values are encoded as unsigned variable-length integers
   specifying the number of seconds that have passed since the standard
   Epoch.  The syntax is identical that used for Numeric Values.  Dates
   prior to the epoch cannot be represented using this syntax.

4.4.  Raw Binary Octet Values

   Binary values are encoded as a length prefixed sequence of arbitrary
   octets.  The length prefix is encoded as an unsigned variable length
   integer.

4.5.  Unsigned Variable Length Integer Syntax

   The uvarint syntax is identical to that used by Google's protobufs.
   They are serialized with the least-significant bytes first in batches
   of 7-bits, with the most significant bit per byte reserved as a

   For example, the binary representation of the 32-bit integer 217 is:

   00000000 00000000 00000000 11011001


   The variable length encoding is:

   11011001 00000001


   The binary representation of the 32-bit integer 1386210052 is:

   01010010 10011111 11100011 00000100


   The variable length encoding is:

   10000100 11000110 11111111 10010100 00000101


4.6.  Huffman Coding

   All UTF-8 text values are compressed using a modified static huffman
   code.  "Modified" because the encoded version may contain compact-
   representations of raw, arbitrary UTF-8 bytes that are not covered by
   the static huffman code table.

   There are two huffman tables in use, one for HTTP Requests and
   another for HTTP Responses, each covers UTF-8 codepoints strictly
   less than 128 as well the fifty possible UTF-8 leading octets.

   The encoded result MUST end with a specific terminal sequence of bits
   called the "HUFFMAN_EOF".  Currently, the HUFFMAN_EOF is the same for
   both the Request and Response tables, but that could change if the
   tables are regenerated.  Currently, the HUFFMAN_EOF sequence is
   101001.

   Codepoints >= 128 are handled by first taking the leading octet of
   the UTF-8 representation and serializing it's associated huffman code
   from the table to the output stream, then, depending on the octets
   value, serializing the six least significant bits from each of the
   remaining trailing octets.

   For instance, the UTF-8 character U+00D4 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH
   CIRCUMFLEX), with UTF-8 representation of C394 (hex) is encoded as:

   11000100 01010010 10010000


   The first 8-bits represents the huffman-table prefix, the first six
   most significant bytes of the second octet are taken directly from
   the six least significant bits of the second UTF-8 byte (0x94).
   Following those six bits are the six bits of the HUFFMAN_EOF 101001,
   followed by four unset padding bits.

   The number of raw UTF-8 bits to write depends on the value of the
   leading octet.  If the value is between 0xC2 and 0xDF (inclusive),
   six bits from the second continuation byte is encoded.  If the value
   is between 0xE0 and 0xEF (inclusive), six bits from the second and
   third continuation bytes are encoded.  If the value is between 0xF0
   and 0xF4 (inclusive), six bits from the second, third and fourth
   continuation bytes are encoded.  UTF-8 codepoints that require
   greater than four bytes to encode cannot be represented.

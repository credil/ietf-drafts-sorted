1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Predicates, a JSON-based [RFC4627]
   syntax for the description and serialization of logical boolean
   predicate operations intended to be used in conjunction with other
   JSON-based mechanisms, such as JSON Patch [RFC6902], as a means of
   incorporating conditional processing.

   JSON Predicates can be used, for instance, to extend a JSON Patch
   [RFC6902] document to provide for a broader range of conditional
   processing options not currently supported by JSON Patch.

   Example: Given a source JSON document

   {
     "a": {
       "b": {
         "c": "ABC!XYZ"
       }
     }
   }


   The following JSON Patch with JSON Predicates document will first
   test that the value of the "c" property is a string containing the
   character sequence "ABC" prior to applying the specified "replace"
   operation.

   [
     {
       "op": "and",
       "path": "/a/b/c",
       "apply": [
         {
           "op": "type",
           "value": "string"
         },
         {
           "op": "contains",
           "value": "ABC"
         }
       ]
     },
     {
       "op": "replace",
       "path": "/a/b/c",
       "value": 123
     }
   ]


   It is important to note this specification does not define a distinct
   JSON Predicates Document format.  Rather, it is the intent for JSON
   Predicates to be used within other JSON-based document formats.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   A JSON Predicate is a JSON Object whose members describe a testable
   condition that evaluates as either true or false.

   The essential components of a JSON Predicate include:

   o  A label identifying the predicate operation,

   o  A reference to the value being tested, and

   o  The condition against which the referenced value is to be
      evaluated.

   Predicate objects MUST have exactly one "op" member whose value
   indicates the type of predicate operation to perform.  It's value
   MUST be one of: "and", "contains", "contains-", "defined", "ends",
   "ends-", "in", "in-", "less", "matches", "matches-", "more", "not",
   "or", "starts", "starts-", "test", "test-", "type", or "undefined".
   The semantics for each are defined in the sections that follow.

   Note that the value of the "op" member is case-sensitive and that
   each of the operations listed are in lower-case.  The value "Starts",
   for example, is not equivalent to "starts".

   If the "op" member specifies any value other than one of those listed
   above, the evaluation of the predicate operation MUST cease and be
   handled as if a boolean value of "false" was returned.  The
   application processing the predicate operation MAY signal that an
   error condition has occurred depending on the specific requirements
   of the application within which JSON Predicates are being used.

   The remaining structure of each predicate operation depends on the
   specific type.  There are two basic types of predicates.

   o  First Order Predicates that are used to test one name value pair
      against a single condition, and

   o  Second Order Predicates that aggregate one or more subordinate
      First or Second Order Predicates.

   In addition to the required "op" member, First Order Predicates have
   exactly one "path" member whose value MUST be a string containing a
   JSON-Pointer [RFC6901] value referencing the name value pair that is
   to be tested.  If the "path" member is not specified within the
   predicate object, it's value is assumed to be an empty string.

   Second Order Predicates MUST have exactly one "apply" member whose
   value is a JSON Array containing one or more First or Second Order
   Predicate Objects.

   Additional members can be required depending on the specific
   predicate operation.  All other members not explicitly defined by
   this specification MUST be ignored.

   Note that the ordering of members in JSON objects is not significant;
   therefore the following operations are equivalent:

   {"op": "contains", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": "ABC"}
   {"path": "/a/b/c", "op": "contains", "value": "ABC"}
   {"value": "ABC", "path": "/a/b/c", "op": "contains"}


2.1.  Predicate Context

   All JSON Predicates are evaluated against a given base context.  The
   nature of this context is dependent entirely on the application
   within which JSON Predicates is being used.  For instance, when used
   together with JSON Patch, the JSON Predicate operations are evaluated
   relative to the JSON document that is the target of the JSON Patch
   operation.

   Although Predicate Objects use JSON Pointer references to identify
   values against which a predicate operation is evaluated, the base
   context is not required to be a JSON object or array.  In such cases,
   however, it is the responsibility of the application implementation
   to determine how to interpret the JSON Pointer reference relative to
   the base context.

2.2.  First Order Predicates

2.2.1.  "contains" and "contains-"

   The "contains" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element
   is defined and has a value whose string representation contains the
   exact sequence of characters given by the predicate object's "value"
   member.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": "This is a test"
     }
   }


   The following predicate would evaluate as "true":

   {
     "op": "contains",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "value": " is a "
   }


   By default, character matching MUST be performed in a case-sensitive
   manner.  To override this default behavior and perform case-
   insensitive matching, use "contains-" as the value of "op".

   For instance, the following will evaluate as "true":

   {
     "op": "contains-",
     "path": "/a/b/",
     "value": " Is A "
   }


2.2.2.  defined

   The "defined" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element
   exists within the target context.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
   "a": {
     "b": null
    }
   }


   The following predicate would evaluate as "true" because the path "/a
   /b" exist within the document despite being explicitly set to null:

   {
     "op": "defined",
     "path": "/a/b"
   }


   The following predicate would evaluate as "false" because the path "/
   a/c" does exist within the document.

   {
     "op": "defined",
     "path": "/a/c"
   }


2.2.3.  ends

   The "ends" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element is
   defined and has a value whose string representation ends with the
   exact sequence of characters given by the predicate object's "value"
   member.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": "This is a test"
     }
   }


   The following predicate would evaluate as "true":

   {
     "op": "ends",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "value": " test"
   }


   By default, character matching MUST be performed in a case-sensitive
   manner.  To override this default behavior and perform case-
   insensitive matching, use "ends-" as the value of "op".

   For instance, the following will evaluate as "true":

   {
     "op": "ends-",
     "path": "/a/b/",
     "value": " TEST"
   }


2.2.4.  in

   The "in" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element
   specifies a value exactly equal to one of the members of a JSON array

   provided by the predicate's "value" member.  Equality is determined
   following the sames rules specified for the JSON Patch "test"
   operation in [RFC6902], Section 4.6, with one exception given for
   optional case-insensitive comparisons.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": 10
     }
   }


   The following will evaluate as "true":

   {
     "op": "in",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "value": [1, "foo", 10, {"z":"y"}]
   }


   The value specified for the "value" member MUST be a JSON Array.

   By default, when comparing string values, character matching MUST be
   performed in a case-sensitive manner.  To override this default
   behavior and perform case-insensitive matching, use "in-" as the
   value of "op".

2.2.5.  less

   The "less" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element is
   defined and specifies a number whose value is less than that
   specified by the predicate object's "value" member.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": 10
     }
   }


   The following will evaluate as "true":

   {
     "op": "less",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "value": 15
   }


2.2.6.  matches

   The "matches" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element
   is defined and has a value whose completely string representation
   matches the regular expression provided by the predicate object's
   "value" member.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": "this is a test"
     }
   }


   The following evalutes as "true":

   {
     "op": "matches",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "value": "[\\w\\s]*"
   }


   The predicate's matching pattern is expressed as a string value
   conforming to the JavaScript Regular Expression syntax (see [1]).

   By default, matching against the regular expression MUST be performed
   in a case-sensitive manner.  To override this default behavior and
   perform case-insensitive matching, use "matches-" as the value of
   "op".  Using this alternative is equivalent to using the "i" modifier
   flag within the JavaScript Regular Expression syntax (e.g. "/\w\s/*/
   i").

   For instance:

   {
     "op": "matches-",
     "path": "/a/b/",
     "value": "[\\w\\s]*"
   }


2.2.7.  more

   The "more" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element is
   defined and specifies a number whose value is greater than that
   specified by the predicate object's "value" member.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": 10
     }
   }


   The following will evaluate as "true":

   {
     "op": "more",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "value": 5
   }


2.2.8.  starts

   The "starts" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element is
   defined and has a value whose string representation begins with the
   exact sequence of characters given by the predicate object's "value"
   member.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": "This is a test"
     }
   }

     "path": "/a/b",

   }


   By default, character matching MUST be performed in a case-sensitive
   manner.  To override this default behavior and perform case-
   insensitive matching, use "starts-" as the value of "op".

   For instance, the following will evaluate as "true":

   {
     "op": "starts-",
     "path": "/a/b/",
     "value": "this "
   }


2.2.9.  test

   The JSON Patch "test" operation, as defined by [RFC6902],
   Section 4.6, can be used as a First Order Predicate operation.  It
   evaluates as true if the referenced element exists and specifies a
   value that is exactly equal to that provided by the predicate's
   "value" member.  The rules for evaluating equality are identical to
   those defined within [RFC6902], Section 4.6, with one exception given
   for optional case-insensitive comparisons.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": "this is a test"
     }
   }

   The following predicate would evaluate as "true"

   {
     "op": "test",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "value": "this is a test"
   }


   By default, when comparing string values, character matching MUST be
   performed in a case-sensitive manner To override this default
   behavior and perform case-insensitive matching, use "test-" as the
   value of "op".

2.2.10.  type

   The "type" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element
   exists and specifies a value whose value type is equal to that
   specified by the predicate's "value" member.

   The "value" member MUST specify one of: "number", "string",
   "boolean", "object", "array", "null", "undefined", "date", "date-
   time", "time", "lang", "lang-range", "iri" or "absolute-iri".

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": "this is a test",
       "c": [1,2,3]
     }
   }


   The following predicate would evaluate as "true"

   {
     "op": "type",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "value": "string"
   }


   When evaluating the type of a value, the following rules apply:

   o  If the "value" member specifies "number", the type predicate will
      evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member is a
      JSON number.

Internet-Draft               JSON Predicates              September 2013


   o  If the "value" member specifies "string", the type predicate will
      evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member is a
      JSON string.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "boolean", the type predicate will
      evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member is a
      JSON boolean.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "object", the type predicate will
      evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member is a
      JSON object.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "array", the type predicate will
      evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member is a
      JSON array.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "null", the type predicate will
      evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member is a
      JSON null.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "undefined", the type predicate
      will evaluate as true if the member referenced by the "path"
      member does not exist.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "date", the type predicate will
      evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member is a
      JSON string conforming to the [RFC3339] "full-date" construct.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "time", the type predicate will
      evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member is a
      JSON string conforming to the [RFC3339] "full-time" construct.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "date-time", the type predicate
      will evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member
      is a JSON string conforming to the [RFC3339] "date-time"
      construct.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "lang", the type predicate will
      evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member is a
      JSON string conforming to the [RFC5646] "Language-Tag" construct.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "lang-range", the type predicate
      will evaluate as true if the value referenced by the "path" member
      is a JSON string conforming to the [RFC4647] "language-range"
      construct.

   o  If the "value" member specifies "absolute-iri", the type predicate
      will evaluate a true if the value referenced by the "path" member
      is a JSON string conforming to the [RFC3987] "IRI" construct.

2.2.11.  undefined

   The "undefined" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element
   does not exist within the target context.

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
   "a": {
     "b": null
    }
   }


   The following predicate would evaluate as "true" because the path "/a
   /c" does not exist within the document:

   {
     "op": "undefined",
     "path": "/a/c"
   }


   However, the following predicate would evaluate as "false" because
   the path "/a/b" does exist within the document, despite specifying an
   explicit null value.

   {
     "op": "undefined",
     "path": "/a/b"
   }


2.3.  Second-Order Predicates

   Second Order Predicates are defined as sets of one or more
   subordinate First and Second Order Predicates.

   All Second Order Predicates MAY contain a "path" member whose value
   specifies a root path prefix for all contained predicates.  If the

   "path" member is not specified, it's value is assumed to be an empty
   string.  For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": {
         "c": "ABC!"
       }
     }
   }


   The following would evaluate as true because the path "/a/b/c" is
   defined.

   {
     "op": "and",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "apply": [
       {
         "op": "defined",
         "path": "/c"
       }
     ]
   }


   The above example is equivalent to:

    {
      "op": "and",
      "apply": [
        {
          "op": "defined",
          "path": "/a/b/c"
        }
      ]
    }


2.3.1.  and

   The "and" predicate evaluates as "true" if all of it's contained set
   of predicate operations evaluate as "true".

   For example, given the JSON document:

       "b" : "foo",
       "c" : {
         "d": 10
       }
     }
   }


   The following would evaluate as "true" because the element "/a/b" is
   defined and the value of element "/a/c/d" is less than 15.

   {
     "op": "and",
     "apply" [
       {
         "op": "defined",

       {

         "path": "/a/c/d",
         "value": 15
       }
     ]
   }


   However, the following would evaluate as "false" because while the
   element "/a/c" exists, the value of that element is not a string.

   {
     "op": "and",
     "apply": [
       {
         "op": "test",
         "path": "/a/c"
       },
       {
         "op": "type",
         "path": "/a/c",
         "value": "string"
       }
     ]
   }

2.3.2.  not

   The "not" predicate evaluates as "true" if all of it's contained set
   of predicate operations evaluate as "false".

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a" : {
       "b" : "foo",
       "c" : {
         "d": 10
       }
     }
   }


   The following would evaluate as "true" because the element "/a/b/e"
   is undefined and the value of element "/a/c/d" is not less than 5.

   {
     "op": "not",
     "apply": [
       {
         "op": "defined",
         "path": "/a/b/e"
       },
       {
         "op": "less",
         "path": "/a/c/d",
         "value": 5
       }
     ]
   }


   However, the following would evaluate as "false" because the element
   "/a/c" exists and the value for element "/a/b" begins with the letter
   "f"

     ]
   }


2.3.3.  or

   The "or" predicate evaluates as "true" if at least one of it's
   contained set of predicate operations evaluate as "true".

   For example, given the JSON document:

   {
     "a" : {
       "b" : "foo",
       "c" : {
         "d": 10

     }
   }

   defined.

       }
     ]
   }


   However, the following would evaluate as "false" because neither
   elements "/a/e" or "/a/f" exist.

   {
     "op": "or",
     "apply": [
       {
         "op": "test",

       {

         "path": "/a/f"
       }
     ]
   }


2.3.4.  Nesting Second Order Predicates

   Second Order Predicates can be combined in a variety of ways to
   define more complex test operations.  For example:

   {
     "op": "or",
     "path": "/a/b",
     "apply": [
       {
         "op": "not",
         "path": "/c",
         "apply": [
           {"op": "undefined"},

           {"op": "starts", "value": "f"}
         ]
       },
       {
         "op": "not",
         "path": "/d",
         "apply": [
           {"op": "defined"},
           {"op": "type", "value": "number"}
         ]
       }
     ]
   }


2.4.  Error Handling

   When an error condition is encounted during the processing of a JSON
   Predicate, the predicate MUST evaluate as false.  Whether or not the
   error condition is reported is dependent on the specific requirements
   of the application within which JSON Predicates are being used.

   Error conditions can arise in each of the following conditions:

   o  JSON Predicate Objects contained within a document fail to conform
      to any normative requirement of this specification, or

   o  The Predicate Object specifies an unknown predicate operation, or

   o  The Predicate Object specifies a JSON Pointer referencing a value
      that does not exist and the specified Predicate operation is not
      specifically intended to test for the absence of a value (i.e. the
      "undefined" and "defined" predicates), or

   o  A First Order Predicate Object specifies a predicate operation
      that requires a "value" member providing the condition to test but
      no "value" member is provided.

   o  The "value" member given for a given predicate operation is of an
      unexpected or unsupported type for that operation (e.g.
      specifying a string value for the "more" and "less" predicate
      operations).

2.5.  Using JSON Predicates within JSON Patch Documents

   While JSON Predicate objects can be used in a variety of
   applications, the syntax has been specifically designed for
   compatibility with the JSON Patch Document format.  JSON Predicate
   objects MAY be used directly within a JSON Patch Document as tests to
   evaluate whether or not the application of a set of patch operations
   should succeed or fail.

   Because of requirements defined by the JSON Patch specification, when
   Second Order Predicates are used as patch test operations within a
   JSON Patch document, the "path" member MUST be specified.  The value
   of the "path" member MAY be an empty string.

   For example, given the following JSON document:

   {
     "a": {
       "b": {
         "c": "123"
       }
     }
   }


   The following JSON Patch + JSON Predicates document will first test
   that the path "/a/b/c" references a string value matching the given
   regular expression prior to replacing that value:

   [
     {
       "op": "and",
       "path": "/a/b/c",
       "apply": [
         {"op": "type", "value": "string"},
         {"op": "matches", "value": "\\d{3}"}
       ]
     },
     {
       "op": "replace",
       "path": "/a/b/c",
       "value": "ABC"
     }
   ]


   When a JSON Predicate object within a JSON Patch document evaluates
   as false, processing of the JSON Patch Document MUST be handled



Snell                    Expires March 27, 2014                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft               JSON Predicates              September 2013


   exactly the same as an unsuccessful JSON Patch operation would be
   handled as defined in JSON-PATCH [RFC6902].  Specifically, processing
   of the JSON Patch document SHOULD terminate and application of the
   entire patch document SHALL NOT be deemed successful.

   The MIME media type "application/json-patch-test" is used to identify
   JSON Patch documents that contain predicates.

   For example:

     PATCH /some-document HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/json-patch-test+json

     [
       {
         "op": "matches",
         "path": "/a/b/c",
         "value": "\\d{3}"
       },
       {
         "op": "replace",
         "path": "/a/b/c",
         "value": "ABC"
       }
     ]


   JSON Patch implementations that do not implement or recognize JSON
   Predicate objects will treat them as unknown patch operations that
   will cause evaluation of the Patch document to fail.

2.5.1.  Conditional Patch Operations

   In addition to being included as top-level operations within a JSON
   Patch Document, Predicate objects can be used to make conditional
   JSON Patch Operations through the use of the optional "if" and
   "unless" properties.

   For instance, in the following example, the value at path "/a/b/0" is
   only removed if the value at path "/a/b" is an Array.

     PATCH /some-document HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/json-patch-test+json

     [
       {



Snell                    Expires March 27, 2014                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft               JSON Predicates              September 2013


         "op": "remove",
         "path": "/a/b/0",
         "if": {
           "op": "type",
           "path": "/a/b",
           "value": "array"
         }
       }
     ]


   Unlike a typical JSON Patch operation, however, the processing of the
   complete Patch document does not fail if the stated condition is not
   met.  The operation is considered to be successful even if the stated
   modification is not performed and processing will continue.

   In the following example, the value at path "/a/b/0" is removed
   unless the value at path "/a/b" is undefined and missing.

     PATCH /some-document HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/json-patch-test

     [
       {
         "op": "remove",
         "path": "/a/b/0",
         "unless": {
           "op": "undefined",
           "path": "/a/b"
         }
       }
     ]


   In a normal JSON Patch document without using predicates, processing
   of the "remove" operation would cease and an error would be reported.
   Using the "if" and "unless" properties, the error condition can be
   avoided and compensated for using a combination of operations.  For
   instance, in the following example the patch document ensures that
   the "/a/b" path exists and is an array before attempting to add new
   items.  If the existing value of "/a/b" is not an array, it's value
   is changed to an array prior to adding items, ensuring that the
   second "add" operation will succeed.

     PATCH /some-document HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/json-patch-test

     [
       {
         "op": "add",
         "path": "/a/b",
         "value": [],
         "unless": {
           "op": "and",
           "apply": [
             {"op": "defined"},
             {"op": "type", "value": "array"}
           ]
         }
       },
       {
         "op": "add",
         "path": "/a/b/-",
         "value": "ABC"
       }
     ]


   The "if" and "unless" properties can be used with any JSON Patch
   operation in a document using the "application/json-patch-test+json"
   content type.  The "if" and "unless" properties MUST NOT be used in
   JSON Predicate objects.

   JSON Predicate objects do not, by themselves, introduce any
   particular security concerns.  Note that JSON documents that consist
   of an arbitrary number of nested Second Order Predicate objects can
   have a detrimental impact on overall performance and could be
   leveraged by a malicious entity as part of a denial of service
   attack.

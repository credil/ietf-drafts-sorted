1.  Introduction

   This specification updates the HTTP LINK and UNLINK methods
   originally defined in [RFC2068].

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Link Relationships

   The LINK and UNLINK methods are used to manage relationships between
   resources.  Those relationships are defined using the Link model
   established in Section 3 of [RFC5988].  For every individual link,
   the context IRI, link relation type, target IRI, and optional
   collection of target attributes MUST be considered; that is, for any
   effective request URI, there can exist at most one Link relationship
   between any context and target IRI pairing with any given combination
   of link relation type and target attributes.

   Within LINK and UNLINK requests, a [RFC5988] Link header field is
   used to describe a Link relationship to be managed.  Any single LINK
   or UNLINK request MAY contain multiple Link header fields, each of
   which describes a separate relationship between a context IRI and
   target IRI.  When a LINK request contains multiple Link header
   fields, the server MUST create all of the specified relationships or
   not create any of them.  Likewise, when an UNLINK request contains
   multiple Link header fields, the server MUST either remove all the
   specified relationship or not remove any of them.

   The target and context IRIs of a Link relationship are determined
   following the requirements specified in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of
   [RFC5988].

   When determining whether or not a relationship already exists between
   a context IRI and target IRI, implementations will need to compare
   the given IRIs with other, previously established relationships.  To
   do so, the implementation MUST first resolve the IRIs as required by
   [RFC5988] and then compare on a case-sensitive, character-by-
   character basis.  For instance, the IRIs "http://example.org/foo" and
   "http://example.org/Foo" MUST NOT be considered to be equivalent.

3.  LINK

   The LINK method is used to establish one or more relationships
   between the resource identified by the effective request URI and one
   or more other resources.  Metadata contained within Link header
   fields [RFC5988] provide information about the relationships being
   established.  A payload within a LINK request has no defined
   semantics.

   LINK requests are idempotent but are not safe.  Establishing a
   relationship causes an inherent change to the state of the target
   resource.

   Any successful response (using a 2xx status code) to a LINK request
   indicates that all of the Link relationships described in the request
   have been established.  No specific 2xx status code is required.

   Responses to LINK requests SHOULD contain one Link header field for
   each Link relationship established by the LINK request.

   Responses to LINK requests are not cacheable.  If a LINK request
   passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses for the
   effective request URI, those stored responses will be invalidated
   (see Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache]).

   The semantics of the LINK method change to a "conditional LINK" if
   the request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-
   Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field
   ([I-D.ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional]).  A conditional LINK requests
   that the relationship be established only under the circumstances
   described by the conditional header field(s).

4.  UNLINK

   The UNLINK method is used to remove one or more relationships between
   the resource identified by the effective request URI and other

   resources.  Metadata contained within Link header fields [RFC5988]
   provide the information about the relationships that are to be
   removed.  A payload within an UNLINK request has no defined
   semantics.

   UNLINK request messages are idempotent but are not safe.  Removing a
   relationship causes an inherent change to the state of the target
   resource.

   Responses to UNLINK requests SHOULD contain one Link header field for
   each Link relationship removed by the UNLINK request.

   Any successful response (using a 2xx status code) to an UNLINK
   request indicates that all of the Link relationships described in the
   request have been removed.  No specific 2xx status code is required.

   Responses to UNLINK requests are not cacheable.  If an UNLINK request
   passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses for the
   effective request URI, those stored responses will be invalidated
   (see Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache]).

   The semantics of the UNLINK method change to a "conditional UNLINK"
   if the request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-
   Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field
   ([I-D.ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional]).  A conditional UNLINK requests
   that the relationship be established only under the circumstances
   described by the conditional header field(s).

5.  Relationship to other HTTP Methods and Discoverability of Links

   The use of the LINK and UNLINK request methods to manage
   relationships between resources has no direct bearing on the use or
   appearance of Link header fields within any other HTTP request or
   response message involving the same effective request URI.  Nor do
   the methods have any direct normative impact on the use of link-like
   structures within the resource representations returned by a server
   for any particular resource.

   Whether and how to represent relationships managed using LINK and
   UNLINK is left solely at the discretion of the server implementation.

   This specification does not define a means of discovering or
   enumerating the relationships that have been established using the
   LINK request method.

6.  Example

Internet-Draft        HTTP Link and Unlink Methods         November 2013


   There exists a broad range of possible use cases for the LINK and
   UNLINK methods.  The examples that follow illustrate a subset of
   those cases.

   Example 1: Creating two separate links between an image and the
   profiles of two people associated with the image:

   LINK /images/my_dog.jpg HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Link: <http://example.com/profiles/joe>; rel="tag"
   Link: <http://example.com/profiles/sally>; rel="tag"


   Possible response:

   HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
   Link: <http://example.com/profiles/joe>; rel="tag"
   Link: <http://example.com/profiles/sally>; rel="tag"


   Example 2: Removing an existing Link relationship between two
   resources:

   UNLINK /images/my_dog.jpg HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Link: <http://example.com/profiles/sally>; rel="tag"


   Possible response:

   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   Link: <http://example.com/profiles/sally>; rel="tag"


   Example 3: Establish a "pingback" or "trackback" style link to a blog
   entry about an article

   LINK /articles/an_interesting_article HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Link: <http://example.com/my_blog_post>; rel="mention"

Internet-Draft        HTTP Link and Unlink Methods         November 2013


   Example 4: Establish a link between two semantically related
   resources:

   LINK /some-resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Link: <http://example.com/schemas/my_schema>; rel="describedBy"


   Example 5: Add an existing resource to a collection:

   LINK /some-collection-resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Link: <http://example.com/my-member-resource>; rel="item"


   Example 6: Link one resource to another that monitors its current
   state (e.g. pub/sub)

   LINK /my-resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Link: <http://example.com/my-monitor>; rel="monitor"


   Example 7: Using the Link anchor attribute to change the context IRI
   (in this example, a link relationship is established between the IRIs
   "acct:joe@example.org" and "acct:sally@example.org")

   LINK /my-resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Link: <acct:joe@example.org>; rel="follow"; anchor="acct:sally@example.org"


7.  Security Considerations

   The LINK and UNLINK methods are subject to the same general security
   considerations as all HTTP methods as described in
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics].

   Because the LINK and UNLINK methods cause changes to a resource's
   state, the server is responsible for determining the client's
   authorization to make such changes.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the LINK and UNLINK methods to the permanent
   registry at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods> (see
   Section 8.1 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics]).

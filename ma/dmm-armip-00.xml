	<t>The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected to be ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a limitation for deploying current mobility management schemes that are intrinsically centralized, e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy MIPv6. This evolution in user traffic demand is tackled by a different approach for IP mobility, called Distributed Mobility Management, which is focusing on moving the mobility anchors from the core network and pushing them closer to the users, at the edge of the network.</t>
    
	<t>The work presented here copes with the distributed approach, describing a novel solution for distributed mobility management support in a flat architecture without central mobility anchors. This document strictly abides by the two principles:</t>
	<t>(a)The movement of MN is transparent to CN.</t>
	<t>(b)MN doesn't participate in any mobility-related signaling.MAAR and AAA are responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] requires client functionality in the IPv6 stack of a mobile node. Exchange of signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent enables the creation and maintenance of a binding between the mobile node's home address and its care-of address. Mobility as specified in requires the IP host to send IP mobility management signaling messages to the home agent, which is located in the network.</t>
	  
    <t> Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network-based mobility to solving the IP mobility challenge. It is possible to support mobility for IPv6 nodes without host involvement by extending Mobile IPv6 signaling messages between a network node and a home agent. In order to facilitate such network-based mobility, the PMIPv6 protocol defines a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG), which acts as a proxy for the Mobile IPv6 signaling, and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) which acts similar to a Home Agent. The LMA and the MAG establish a bidirectional tunnel for forwarding all data traffic belonging to the Mobile Nodes.</t>
	
	<t>Both the Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6 offer mobility support at the cost of handling operations at a cardinal point, the mobility anchor, and burdening it with data forwarding and control mechanisms for a great amount of users. As stated in [I-D.chan-distributed-mobility-ps], centralized mobility solutions are prone to several problems and limitations: longer (sub-optimal) routing paths, scalability problems, signaling overhead (and most likely a longer associated handover latency), more complex network deployment, higher vulnerability due to the existence of a potential single point of failure, and lack of granularity on the mobility management service (i.e., mobility is offered on a per-node basis, not being possible to define finer granularity policies, as for example per-application).</t>
	
	<t>In the paper "A Network-based Localized Mobility Solution for Distributed Mobility Management" [Net-basedDMM], the authors describe two approaches: one is fully distributed approach and another is partially distributed approach. The main issue in the first one is how a Mobility Anchor and Access Router (MAAR) can differentiate between the first attachment to the network and subsequent handovers.</t>
	
	<t>This document describes MAAR and AAA support for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host. This can settle the issue that mobility entities can differentiate between the first attachment to the network and subsequent handovers. This document strictly abides by the two principles. The first one is the movement of MN is transparent to CN. Another one is the MN doesn't participate in any mobility-related signaling.</t>

       <section title="Requirements">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Terminology">
       <t>The document also uses the terminology define in [RFC6275].The following terminology is also used:</t>
       <t>MAAR(Mobility anchor and Access Router). First hop routers where the mobile nodes attach to. They can play the role of mobility managers for the IPv6 prefixes they anchor, or can for the IPv6 addresses they anchor. In this draft, MAAR assigns the IPv6 address for each currently registered MN. For the convenience of narrative, we call the MAAR which the user is currently attached to as the AMAAR, and call the MAAR which was previously visited by the user is FMAAR. Before the MN handover, the AMAAR becomes a FMAAR. We call this FMAAR as a PMAAR.</t>

       <t>AMAAR (Accessing MAAR). MAAR which the MN is currently attached to. Every ALMN MUST establish and maintain two binding lists for each currently registered mobile node. One is the internal binding list, and another is the external binding list. Every AMAAR configures the IPv6 addresses for the new users. So that AMAAR performs mobility management on behalf of a mobile node. Every AMAAR is responsible for detecting the mobile node's movements to and from the access link and for initiating binding registrations.</t>
    
       <t>FMAAR (Forwarding MAAR).  MAAR which was previously visited by the MN and is still involved in an active flow using an IPv6 address it had advertised to the MN (i.e., MAAR where that IPv6 address is anchored). The MN may have one or more FMAAR.</t>

       <t> AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting ).  AAA server records the user's static and dynamic information, and the dynamic information includes the address information of MAAR which the MN is registered right now.</t>

       <t>DBU/DBA (Distributed BU/BA).  A MAAR sends the DBU/DBA message to another MAAR for establishing corresponding binding list. In this draft, we have two kinds of the DBU/DBA messages. One is the pDBU/pDBA message and another is the fDBU/fDBA message.</t>

       <t>pDBU/pDBA.  A pDBU message is sent by the AMAAR to the PMAAR of the MN for establishing the binding between the mobile node's AMAAR and PMAAR. This message includes the address of the AMAAR. After receiving the pDBU message, the PMAAR replies a pDBA message to the AMAAR including the addresses of the FMAARs and the addresses of the MN assigned by the FMAARs.</t>

       <t> fDBU/fDBA.  A fDBU message is sent by the AMAAR to the FMAAR (except PMAAR) of the MN for establishing the binding between the mobile node's AMAAR and FMAAR (except PMAAR). This message includes the address of the AMAAR. After receiving the fDBU message, the FMAAR replies a fDBA message to the AMAAR.</t>
       </section>
 </section>

<section title="MAAR Operation">
<t>Upon the MN's attachment to a MAAR, say MAAR1, MN establishes the first communication with the CN1.After that, the MN moves and is now attached to MAAR2.The MN establishes the first communication with the CN2. In this draft, the packages between the MN and the CN1 must go by the MAAR1 (now becomes the MN's FMAAR).This section describes the operational details.</t>

   <section title="Operation between AMAAR and AAA">
   <t>AMAAR MUST send diameter request message to the AAA after detecting the MN's movement to the access link. After receiving the message, the AAA checks dynamic information using the MN's ID. If the AAA finds the address information of the previous AMAAR, then the AAA sends the diameter response message to the AMAAR with the address of the previous AMAAR. If the AAA can¡¯t find this information, then AMAAR receives the diameter response message with the zero address. After that, the AMAAR will differentiate between the first attachment to the network and subsequent handovers. After sending out the diameter response message, the AAA MUST update the dynamic information including the address information of AMAAR.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Binding list in MAAR">
   <t>Every AMAAR MUST establish and maintain two binding lists for each currently registered MN. One is the internal binding list, and another is the external binding list. The first one stores a binding of the MN's addresses assigned by FMAARs and the MN's FMAARs addresses. The second one stores a binding of the MN's address assigned by AMAAR and the MN's addresses assigned by FMAARs. The external binding list is used to transmit packets to MN. The internal binding list is used to transmit packets from MN.</t>

   <t>Every FMAAR MUST maintain one binding list for each previously registered MN. This list stores a binding of the MN's address assigned by this FMAAR and the address of the MN's AMAAR.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Operation between AMAAR and FMAAR">
   <t>If AMAAR learns that the MN is the handover attachment, AMAAR will send pDBU message to the PMAAR. The PMAAR address information is included in diameter response message. At this time, the PMAAR has two binding lists. One is the internal binding list, and another is the External binding list. After receiving the pDBU message, the PMAAR will send a pDBA message including its Internal binding list, the IPv6 address assigned by PMAAR and the address of the PMAAR. The AMAAR and the PMAAR establish a bidirectional tunnel for forwarding all data traffic belonging to the MN.</t>

   <t>If AMAAR gets the addresses of the FMAARs(besides the PMAAR),AMAAR will sends the fDBU message including the address of the AMAAR to the FMAAR(besides the PMAAR).After receiving the fDBU message, the FMAARs can refresh the binding list and response the fDBA message. Now the FMAAR stores the MN's address assigned by this FMAAR and the address of the AMAAR. After that, the AMAAR and the FMAARs (besides the PMAAR) establish a bidirectional tunnel for forwarding all data traffic belonging to the MN.</t>
   </section>
</section>

<section title="Description of the solution">
<t>The purpose of Distributed Mobility Management approaches is to overcome the limitations of the traditional centralized mobility management by bringing the mobility anchor closer to the MN. Following this idea, in our proposal, the central anchor is moved to the edge of the network, being deployed in the access router of the mobile node. That is, the first elements that provide IP connectivity to a set of MNs are also the mobility managers for those MNs. In the following, we will call MAAR (Mobility anchor and Access Router).</t>

  <t> Upon the MN's attachment to a MAAR, say MAAR1, MN establishes the first communication with the CN1.After that, the MN moves and is now attached to MAAR2.The MN establishes the first communication with the CN2.HoA1 is the MN's address assigned by the MAAR1. HoA2 is the MN's address assigned by the MAAR1. When the MN moves from its current access, it associates to MAAR3 which delegates another IPv6 address (HoA3). Figure 1 illustrates this scenario.</t>

      <t>(2) MAAR3 sends the diameter request message to AAA. </t>
	  <t>(3) AAA has the address information of MAAR2. AAA sends the diameter response message including the address of the MAAR2, and then the AAA updates the MN's the dynamic information including the address information of MAAR3.</t>

<section title="Forwarding Considerations">
   <section title="Forwarding Packets Sent by the Mobile Node">
   <t>After receiving the packages sent by the MN, AMAAR will check the source address of the packages. If the address is assigned by the AMAAR, the AMAAR will forward the packages to the CN according to the destination address of the packages. If the address isn¡¯t assigned by the AMAAR, the AMAAR will search for the internal binding list according to the source address and then find the address of the corresponding FMAAR. Then, AMAAR encapsulates the packages to the corresponding FMAAR.</t>

	<t>In this document, upon the MN's attachment to a MAAR, say MAAR1, MN establishes the first communication with the CN1.After that, the MN moves and is now attached to MAAR2.The MN establishes the first communication with the CN2.HoA1 is the MN's address assigned by the MAAR1. HoA2 is the MN's address assigned by the MAAR2. When the MN moves from its current access, it associates to MAAR3 which delegates another IPv6 address (HoA3). MAAR3 has two binding lists. One is the internal binding list, and another is the external binding list. The first one stores MN's HoA1 and the address of MAAR1, MN's HoA2 and the address of MAAR2. The second one stores MN's HoA1 and MN's HoA3, MN's HoA2 and MN's HoA3.</t>

	<t>If the MN sends the packages using the HoA3, then MAAR3 can directly forward to the corresponding CN. If the MN sends the packages using the HoA1, then MAAR3 will search for the internal binding list according to HoA1 and find the address of MAAR1. Then MAAR3 encapsulates the packages to route to MAAR1. The source address of the tunnel header is the address of MAAR3, and the destination address is the address of MAAR1.The format of the tunneled packet is shown below:</t>

	<t>IPv6 header (src= MAAR3's address, dst= MAAR1's address) /* Tunnel Header */</t>
	<t>IPv6 header (src= MN's HoA1, dst= CN's HoA ) /* Packet Header */</t>
	<t>Upper layer protocols /* Packet Content*/</t>

	<t>If the MN sends the packages using the HoA2, then MAAR3 will search for the internal binding list according to HoA2 and find the address of MAAR2. Then MAAR3 encapsulates the packages to route to MAAR2. The source address of the tunnel header is the address of MAAR3, and the destination address is the address of MAAR2.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Forwarding Packets to the Mobile Node">
    <t>On receiving packets from a correspondent node with the destination address matching the mobile node's address assigned by FMAAR, then this FMAAR find the binding list. The list stores the MN's address assigned by FMAAR and MN's address of the AMAAR. Then FMAAR encapsulates the packages to route to AMAAR. The source address of the tunnel header is the address of this FMAAR, and the destination address is the address of AMAAR.</t>

	<t>On receiving packets from the network but not through a tunnel, AMAAR will forward the packages according to the destination address. If AMAAR receives the packets through a tunnel, AMAAR will remove the tunnel head. AMAAR search for the external binding list and find the address assigned by AMAAR according to the destination address of the packets. Then AMAAR forwards them to MN through link-layer.</t>

	<t>In this document, CN1 sends the packages to the MN. The source address of the packages is the address of the CN1, and the destination address is HoA1.The packages arrive the MAAR1.MAAR1 has a binding list which stores HoA1 and the address of MAAR3. Then MAAR1 encapsulates the packages to route to MAAR3. The source address of the tunnel header is the address of this MAAR1, and the destination address is the address of MAAR3. MAAR3 receives the packets and removes the tunnel head. Then MAAR3 searches for the external binding list according to the destination address of the packets. MAAR3 finds the binding of the HoA1 and HoA3, and then forwards the packets to the MN through Link-layer.</t>

	<t>CN2 sends the packages to the MN. The source address of the packages is the address of the CN2, and the destination address is HoA2.The packages arrive the MAAR2.MAAR2 has a binding list which stores HoA2 and the address of MAAR3.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

    <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                      v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->

         Handling MPLS-TP OAM Packets Targeted at Internal MIPs
                  draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mip-mep-map-03

Abstract

   The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
   within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how Maintenance
   Intermediate Points (MIPs) may be situated within network nodes at
   the incoming and outgoing interfaces.

   This document describes a way of forming OAM messages so that they
   can be targeted at MIPs on incoming or MIPs on outgoing interfaces,
   forwarded correctly through the "switch fabric", and handled
   efficiently in node implementations where there is no distinction
   between the incoming and outgoing MIP.

   The material in this document is provided for discussion within the
   MPLS-TP community in the expectation that this idea or some similar
   mechanism will be subsumed into a more general MPLS-TP OAM document.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

1.  Introduction

   The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
   within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)(the MPLS-TP OAM
   Framework, [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework]) distinguishes two
   configurations for Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs) on a node.
   It defines per-node MIPs and per-interface MIPs, where a per-node MIP
   is a single MIP per node in an unspecified location within the node
   and per-interface MIPs are two (or more) MIPs per node on both sides
   of the forwarding engine.

   In-band OAM messages are sent using the Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) [RFC5586].  OAM messages for the transit points of
   pseudowires (PWs) or Label Switched Paths (LSPs) are delivered using
   the expiration of the MPLS shim header time-to-live (TTL) field.  OAM
   messages for the end points of PWs and LSPs are simply delivered as
   normal.

   OAM messages delivered to end points or transit points are
   distinguished from other (data) packets so that they can be processed
   as OAM.  In LSPs, the mechanism used is the presence of the Generic
   Associated Channel Label (GAL) in the Label Stack Entry (LSE) under
   the top LSE [RFC5586].  In PWs, the mechanism used is the presence of
   the PW Associated Channel Header (PWACH) [RFC4385].

   Given these mechanisms and the presence of multiple MIPs on a single
   node, these mechanisms provide no way to address one particular MIP
   out of the set of MIPs on the node.

   This document describes a way of forming OAM messages so that they
   can be targeted at incoming MIPs and outgoing MIPs, forwarded
   correctly through the "switch fabric", and handled efficiently in
   node implementations where there is no distinction between the
   incoming and outgoing MIP.

   The material in this document is provided for discussion within the
   MPLS-TP community in the expectation that this idea or some similar
   mechanisms will be subsumed into a more general MPLS-TP OAM document.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF)/International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architecture to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

   Note that the acronym "OAM" is used in conformance with
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mpls-tp-oam-def].

3.  Summary of the Problem Statement

   Figure 1 shows an abstract functional representation of an MPLS-TP
   node.  It is decomposed as an incoming interface, a cross-connect
   (XC), and an outgoing interface.  As per the discussion in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework], MIPs may be placed in each of the
   functional interface components.

      Figure 1: Abstract Functional Representation of an MPLS-TP Node

   Several distinct OAM functions are required within this architectural
   model such as:

   o  CV between a MEP and a MIP

   o  traceroute over an MPLS-TP LSP and/or an MPLS-TP PW containing
      MIPs

   o  OAM control at a MIP

   o  data-plane loopback at a MIP

   o  diagnostic tests

   The MIPs in these OAM functions may equally be the MIPs at the
   incoming or outgoing interfaces.

   In-band OAM messages are sent using the G-ACh [RFC5586] and ACH-TLVs
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ach-tlv] for MPLS-TP LSPs and MPLS-TP PWs,
   respectively.  OAM messages for the transit points of PWs or LSPs are
   delivered using the expiration of the time-to-live (TTL) field in the
   top LSE of the MPLS packet header.  OAM messages for the end points
   of PWs and LSPs are simply delivered as normal.

   OAM messages delivered to end points or transit points are
   distinguished from other (data) packets so that they can be processed
   as OAM.  In LSPs, the mechanism used is the presence of the Generic

   Associated Channel Label (GAL) in the LSE under the top LSE
   [RFC5586].  In PWs, the mechanism used is the presence of the PW
   Associated Channel Header [RFC4385].

   Any solution for sending OAM to the in and out MIPs must fit within
   these existing models of handling OAM.

   Additionally, many MPLS-TP nodes contain an optimization such that
   all queuing and the forwarding function is performed at the incoming
   interface.  The abstract functional representation of such a node is
   shown in Figure 2.  As shown in the figure, the outgoing interfaces
   are minimal and for this reason it may not be possible to include MIP
   functions on those interfaces.  This is in particular the case for
   existing deployed implementations.

   Any solution that attempts to send OAM to the outgoing interface of
   an MPLS-TP node must not cause any problems when such implementations
   are present.

   Lastly, OAM must operate on MPLS-TP nodes that are branch points on
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP) trees.  That means that it must be
   possible to target individual outgoing MIPs as well as all outgoing
   MIPs in the abstract functional representation shown in Figure 3, as
   well as to handle the optimized P2MP node as shown in Figure 4.

   In summary, the solution for OAM message delivery must support the

   following features:

   o  Forwarding of OAM packets exactly as data packets.

   o  Delivery of OAM messages to the correct MPLS-TP node.

   o  Direction of OAM instructions to the correct MIP within an MPLS-TP
      node.

   o  Packet inspection at the incoming and outgoing interfaces must be
      minimized.

   Note that although this issue appears superficially to be an
   implementation matter local to an individual node, the format of the
   message needs to be standardised so that:

   o  An upstream MEP can correctly target the outgoing MIP of a
      specific MPLS-TP node.

   o  A downstream node can correctly filter out any OAM messages that
      were intended for its upstream neighbor's outgoing MIP, but which
      were not handled there because the upstream neighbor is an
      optimized implementation.

   Note that the last bullet point describes a safety net and an
   implementation should avoid that this situation ever arises.

3.1.  Rejected Partial Solution

   A reject solution is depicted in Figure 5.  All data and non-local
   OAM is handled as normal.  Local OAM is intercepted at the incoming
   interface and delivered to the MIP at the incoming interface.  If the
   OAM is intended for the incoming MIP it is handled there with no
   issue.  If the OAM is intended for the outgoing MIP it is forwarded
   to that MIP using some internal messaging system that is
   implementation-specific.

   This solution is fully functional for the incoming MIP.  It also
   supports control of data loopback for the outgoing MIP, and can
   adequately perform some OAM features such as interface identity
   reporting at the outgoing MIP.

   However, because the OAM message is not forwarded through the switch
   fabric, this solution cannot correctly perform OAM loopback,
   connectivity verification, LSP tracing, or performance measurement.

   Note that the local OAM message means that the OAM message which must
   be terminated, inspected and processed at the in or out MIP of
   depicted MPLS-TP node in Figure 5.

4.  Proposed Solution

   Figure 6 shows a proposed message format for handling the OAM
   messages in different cases as described in Section 3.  The
   subsections that follow describe the processing rules for each case.

   Note that this proposed solution could result in a packet with a
   TTL=0 to be forwarded.  Alternatives are discussed in Section 4.6.

4.1.  Processing of Data and Non-Local OAM

   The message formats and processing rules for data and non-local OAM
   are not changed by this proposal.

   The top-of-stack label is swapped and the top-of-stack TTL is
   decremented.

4.2.  MIP Identification

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] defines various identifiers to be used
   with MPLS-TP.  Using the ACH/PWACH, the MIP identifiers as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] can be added as a TLV after the ACH/
   PWACH.  Both, in- and out-MIPs can therefore unambiguously tell

Internet-Draft            Internal MIP Handling             October 2010


   whether an OAM packet is indeed destined to be processed by it.
   Various ways to address in- and out-MIPs are conceivable, such as
   using the TTL field in the GAL, however, the GAL is only applicable
   to LSPs.  Furthermore, in case of a P2MP LSP one out of a number of
   out-MIPs might need to be uniquely addressed which a TTL field alone
   cannot accomplish.  Therefore, in order to define a single mechanism
   that can be used in all MPLS-TP constructs (PWs, LSPs and P2MP
   scenarios) the MIP IDs as defined by [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers]
   can always be consistently used.

   To facilitate an efficient implementation in hardware, the identifier
   TLV MUST be in a fixed location after the ACH/PWACH.  In case, the
   identifier TLV is missing, the in-MIP/or per-nore MIP should process
   the packet.  This is to ensure compatibility with in-MIP-only/
   per-node-MIP-only systems.  However, OAM messages which need to
   verify the target MIP must contain a TLV that identifies the target
   MIP ID as desribed in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers].

4.3.  In-MIP Processing

   The top-of-stack TTL is decremented and expires.  The packet is
   examined further and the GAL is discovered indicating that the packet
   contains an ACH which needs to be further examined.  In case of PWs,
   the S bit [RFC3032] is found to be set, and the next nibble is
   examined.  This shows that a PWACH is present.  The Channel Type
   field of the PWACH [RFC4385] indicates that the packet is OAM.  The
   following ACH needs to be further examined.

   The ACH type indicates the type of OAM and the the MIP identifier (if
   present) can be found in a TLV in a fixed location following the ACH.
   In case the ID TLV is not present, the in-MIP (or per-node MIP)
   processes that OAM packet.

4.4.  Out-MIP Processing

   OAM messages intended for the out-MIP on a node are initially
   intercepted as described in the previous section.  That is, the TTL
   expires and further inspection of the packet indicates that it is
   OAM.

   The incoming interface must forward the OAM message through the
   switch fabric as if it was data.  The packet is passed on unchanged
   except that the TTL has been decremented and expires.

   The processing at the out-MIP is comparable to the in-MIP processing.
   The TTL has already expired (i.e., is has been decremented to zero at
   the incoming interface).  If the outgoing interface is capable of
   packet inspection, the top- level TTL is found to be zero and the

Internet-Draft            Internal MIP Handling             October 2010


   packet is removed from the data stream.  In case of LSP OAM, the GAL
   is discovered indicating that the packet contains an ACH which needs
   to be further examined.  In case of PWs, the S bit [RFC3032] is found
   to be set, and the next nibble is examined.  This shows that a PWACH
   is present.  The Channel Type field of the PWACH [RFC4385] indicates
   that the packet is OAM.  The following ACH needs to be further
   examined.

   The ACH type indicates the type of OAM and the MIP ID TLV (if
   present) MUST be in a fixed location following the ACH.  Packets not
   intended for a given out-MIP are silently discarded.  In case there
   is no TLV, the out-MIP should discard the packet as the in-MIP should
   respond in this case.  A per-node MIP should respond.

   If the outgoing interface is not capable of packet inspection the
   packet will be forwarded out of the outgoing interface.  See
   Section 4.6 for more details.

4.5.  Processing at P2MP Branch Nodes

   At P2MP branch nodes, the OAM messages may be targeted at one or all
   outgoing interfaces.  It should be noted that packet replication is a
   function of the switch fabric so that any OAM message forwarded by
   the incoming interface will be passed to all outgoing interfaces.
   The procedures operate as described before and ACH TLVs are required
   to limit the OAM to one or more out-MIPs.

4.5.1.  Out-MIP Processing

   The outgoing interfaces are able to determine whether the OAM message
   is intended for the local out-MIP by examining a MIP identifier
   carried in an ACH TLV.  There are two potential solutions to this
   problem.  One could allow more than one MIP identifier to allow
   multiple out-MIPs on the same P2MP tree to be targeted by the same
   OAM message.  This however complicates hardware design as the out-
   MIPs need to parse the TLV.

   Therefore, instead of having multiple TLVs in a single OAM message,
   in case two or more out-MIPs need to be addressed, two or more
   messages need to be sent, each carrying the ID TLV identifying the
   targeted out-MIP.

   A special MIP identifier number is used to indicate that all out-MIPs
   on the P2MP PW are targets.  This identifier must include an
   identifier that is unique to the local node as described in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers].

   An OAM message received at an outgoing interface for a P2MP LSP which



Farrel, et al.           Expires April 18, 2011                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft            Internal MIP Handling             October 2010


   does not including any ACH TLVs to identify the out-MIP, should be
   silently discarded.

   OAM messages received at outgoing interfaces that support out-MIP
   OAM, but that are not intended for the local MIP are silently
   discarded.

   If the outgoing interface is not capable of packet inspection the
   packet will be forwarded out of the outgoing interface.  See
   Section 4.6 for more details.

4.6.  Processing When There is No Out-MIP

   When there is no out-MIP support on an optimized node implementation
   there are three options.

   1.  The OAM message is intercepted at the incoming interface and the
       incoming interface is aware that it forms part of an optimized
       implementation that does not support an out-MIP.  It can discard
       the received OAM message, or respond to indicate that the out-MIP
       is not supported.

   2.  The OAM message is intercepted and forwarded as described in
       Section 4.4.  Since there is no out-MIP, the message is forwarded
       out of the outgoing interface to the next downstream MPLS-TP node
       as shown at the bottom of Figures Figure 6 and Figure 7.  This
       means that the packet will be received at the downstream node
       carrying a TTL that has already expired (before it is decremented
       at the downstream node) indicating that the packet should be
       silently discarded.  If the packet is examined in this case, it
       will reveal an ACH TLV identifying a MIP that is not local to the
       downstream node.  This will result in the packet being dropped or
       a negative response being sent.

   3.  The OAM message is intercepted at the incoming interface and this
       is a per node MIP which only reacts to TTL expiry (no other
       inspection needs to be performed for a per node MIP).  In that
       case it would process the OAM packet and send a reply if one is
       needed.  For the MEP receiving the reply there might be no way of
       telling that this was send by the incoming MIP.

5.  Enhanced Proposed Solutions

   The above described mechanism has one serious disadvantage, which is
   that there are potential situations in which a labeled packet with a
   TTL of 0 could be forwarded.  This is not standards conformant
   behavior.  RFC 3032 states:

   "If the outgoing TTL of a labeled packet is 0, then the labeled
   packet MUST NOT be further forwarded; nor may the label stack be
   stripped off and the packet forwarded as an unlabeled packet.  The
   packet's lifetime in the network is considered to have expired."

   As a consequence, there needs to be a way to achieve standard
   conformant behavior.  The following are proposals to achieve this.

5.1.  Incoming MIP Filtering

   In Section 4.6, one potential way of handling the case where there is
   no outgoing MIP is to make an incoming MIP aware of the MIP
   configuration for the maintenance entity it is part of via
   configuration.  This enables the incoming MIP to make sure that no
   labeled packet with a TTL=0 ever leaves the node.  It also enables
   the MIP to reply to an OAM packet which is addressed to an outgoing
   MIP with an error code ('No Such MIP') if desired.

5.2.  Outgoing MIP Label

   The mechanisms described in Section 4 can be enhanced by the use of a
   new reserved label, the Outgoing MIP Label (OML).  This label is
   substituted for the GAL when an OAM message intended for an outgoing
   MIP is processed at an incoming interface as shown in Figure 8.

   The advantage of this mechanism is that the outgoing interface of the
   local node and the incoming interface of the downstream node have
   something more substantial to check than just the TTL value being
   zero.  In fact, it allows the message to be sent with TTL of one so
   that the rules for sending packets with zero TTL are not compromised.

   The disadvantage is that a further reserved label is used,
   potentially more to cater for the P2MP case.

   Note that an option is to allocate the OML as a purely local matter.
   That means that the implementation allocates the value of the OML
   from its local label space and assigns the meaning as described.
   This approach, however, would be risky if the packet escaped and was
   processed by the downstream node.

6.  Security Considerations

   OAM security is discussed in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework] and
   [I-D.manral-mpls-tp-oam-security-tlv].

   OAM can provide useful information for detecting and tracing security
   attacks.

   OAM can also be used to illicitly gather information or for denial of
   service attacks and other types of attack.  Implementations therefore
   are required to offer security mechanisms for OAM.  Deployments are
   strongly advised to use such mechanisms.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This revision of this document does not make any requests of IANA.

   If the solution described in Section 4 is adopted, a request will be
   made to IANA for the allocation of a new reserved label.

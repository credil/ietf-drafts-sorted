                     The UDP Tunnel Transport mode
                  draft-fairhurst-6man-tsvwg-udptt-03.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes a standards track protocol called the UDP
   Tunnel Transport.  This protocol updates the UDP processing of RFC
   2460 for IPv6 hosts and routers.  The update enables a sender to
   generate a UDP datagram where the UDP checksum is replaced by a
   header check determined only by the protocol header information.  For
   this use, the document also updates the way the IPv6 UDP length field
   is interpreted.  This mode is intended to minimise the processing
   cost for the transport of tunnel packets using UDP.

1.  Introduction

   The UDP Tunnel Transport (UDPTT) is a protocol that updates the User
   Datagram Protocol (UDP) processing of RFC2460 [RFC2460] for IPv6
   hosts and routers.  UDPTT is intended to transport datagrams that
   carry tunnel-encapsulated packets.  It is not intended as a general
   purpose transport, since it is applicable only for cases where the
   tunnel application can provide a set of checks on the correctness of
   the received payload.

   A UDPTT end point may be either a host or a router.  The tunneling
   protocol introduces a header check that validates the delivery of the
   packet to the correct transport endpoint.  This check is not intended
   as an authentication check (in the manner of a security protocol),
   but is introduced to reduce the probability that the endpoint stacks
   receive erroneous packets that may corrupt internal state, introduce
   unnecessary packet processing, or lead to ambiguous packet counts.

   The way in which the header check is computed in UDPTT will usually
   result in a constant value for each UDPTT flow.  This value may be
   cached as a part of the tunnel endpoint flow state.  Once the tunnel
   has been created, this requires a receiver to perform a 16-bit
   comparison operation, rather than a 1's complement checksum.  This
   approach was driven by a desire to eliminate expensive computation in
   routers that may need to handle many flows operating at high rate.

   The next section provides background information on UDP variants and
   the use of UDP for tunneling.  Section 2 defines the UDPTT protocol
   and section 3 provides information about the use of UDPTT.

1.1.  Background

   UDP is defined in [RFC0768].  This supports two checksum behaviours
   when used with IPv4.  The normal behaviour is for the sender to
   calculate a checksum over a block of data that includes a pseudo
   header and the UDP datagram payload.  The receiver validates this
   checksum to verify delivery to the intended transport endpoint.

   The UDP header includes a 16-bit one's complement checksum that
   provides a statistical guarantee that the payload was not corrupted
   in transit.  It also allows the receiver to verify that the endpoint
   was the intended destination of the datagram, because it includes a
   pseudo header that covers the IP addresses, port numbers, transport
   payload length, and Next Header/Protocol value corresponding to the
   UDP transport protocol.  The length field verifies that the datagram
   is not truncated or padded.  The checksum therefore protects an
   application against receiving corrupted payload data in place of, or
   in addition to, the data that was sent.  Applications are recommended

   to enable UDP checksums [RFC5405], although UDP [RFC0768] permits the
   option to be disabled when used with IPv4.

   Unlike IPv4, when UDP datagrams are originated by an IPv6 node, the
   UDP checksum is not optional.  The use of the UDP checksum is
   required when applications transmit UDP over IPv6 [RFC2460], since
   there is no network-layer integrity check.  UDPTT provides an
   alternative intended to achieve at least equivalent protection to
   using IPv4 (with the associated header checksum) and UDP (with the
   checksum disabled).

   UDP-Lite [RFC3828] provides a checksum with an optional partial
   coverage.  When using this option, a datagram is divided into a
   sensitive part (covered by the checksum) and an insensitive part (not
   covered by the checksum).  Errors in the insensitive part will not
   cause the packet to be discarded by the transport layer at the
   receiving host.  When the checksum covers the entire packet, which
   should be the default, UDP-Lite is semantically identical to UDP.
   UDP-Lite is specified for use with IPv4 and IPv6, and uses an IP
   protocol type (or IPv6 next header) with a value of 136 decimal.

   While UDP-Lite benefits from differential link error treatment, where
   the packet header is afforded higher protection on a radio link
   compared to the payload, this is explicitly not the goal of UDPTT.
   For UDPTT, the payload is expected to be protected by other integrity
   checks, and generally all parts of the packet will seek equal
   protection, as for UDP and TCP.  Since UDP-Lite also includes the
   total packet length (extracted from the IP module), the calculated
   checksum depends on the size of the encapsulated packet, whereas in
   UDPTT, the checksum protection does not validate the actual size of
   the transport layer payload.

1.2.  Use of UDP Tunnels

   One increasingly popular use of UDP is as a tunneling protocol, where
   a tunnel endpoint encapsulates the packets of another protocol inside
   UDP datagrams and transmits them to another tunnel endpoint.  Using
   UDP as a tunneling protocol is attractive when the payload protocol
   is not supported by middleboxes that may exist along the path,
   because many middleboxes support transmission using UDP.  In this
   use, the receiving endpoint decapsulates the UDP datagrams and
   forwards the original packets contained in the payload [RFC5405].
   Tunnels establish virtual links that appear to directly connect
   locations that are distant in the physical Internet topology and can
   be used to create virtual (private) networks.

   This is expected to be the normal use of UDPTT, where UDPTT may
   replace UDP as the tunnel transport when there is a desire to reduce

   processing costs at the tunnel endpoints.  The end point for the
   UDPTT may be either a host or a router.

   {Note: The current specification targets use with IPv6, however the
   method may also be applicable to IPv4}


2.  Update to RFC 2460 to support UDTT

   This section defines the update to IPv6 [RFC2460], if this document
   is approved for publication by the IETF.

2.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  UDPTT Next Header Value

   UDPTT datagrams are carried in the payload of IPv6 packets.  UDP and
   UDPTT share the next header protocol number (decimal 17) and are
   differentiated only by the Length of the IP payload.

2.3.  UDPTT Header Format

   The UDPTT header is shown in figure Figure 1.  This format resembles
   that of UDP.
                    0              15 16             31
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                   |     Source      |   Destination   |
                   |      Port       |      Port       |
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                   |                 |     Header      |
                   |    0x0008       |      Check      |
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                   |                                   |
                   :           UDPTT Payload           :
                   |  (no additional integrity check)  |
                   +-----------------------------------+

                       Figure 1: UDPTT Header Format

   The source and destination ports are used in the same way as for UDP
   and UDP-Lite.  UDPTT places the constant value 0x0008 in the position
   occupied by the Length field in UDP and the Checksum Coverage Field
   in UDP-Lite.  The value of 0x0008 is legal for both UDP and UDP-Lite.

   The length of the payload part is determined from the size
   information provided by the IP module in the same manner as for TCP
   [RFC0793].

   The Header Check field is a 16-bit value calculated as specified in
   the next section.  This value is set by the sender and validated by
   the receiver.

2.4.  UDP and UDPTT Datagrams with no payload

   It is expected that UDPTT datagrams will carry a tunnel-encapsulated
   packet as payload.  A UDPTT datagram with no payload is
   indistinguishable from a UDP datagram with no payload.  Both have the
   same representation on the wire, and the same semantics at the sender
   and receiver.  There is no need for a receiver to differentiate these
   packets.

2.5.  Calculation of IPv6 UDPTT Header Check

   The Header Check is computed as the 16-bit one's complement of the
   one's complement sum [RFC1071] of a pseudo-header of information
   collected from the IPv6 and UDPTT header fields.

   The following illustration shows the UDPTT pseudo-header for IPv6:
       0            7 8            15 16            23 24             31

       +                                                               +
       |                                                               |

                        UDPTT Pseudo header fields

   o  As in UDP, if the IPv6 packet carrying the UDPTT datagrams also
      carries an additional extension header that contains a Routing
      header, the Destination Address used in the pseudo-header is that
      of the final destination.  At the originating node, that address
      will be in the last element of the Routing header; at the
      recipient(s), that address will be in the Destination Address
      field of the IPv6 header [RFC2460].

   o  The pseudo header of UDPTT is different from the pseudo header of
      UDP in one way: This pseudo header replaces the Upper-Layer Packet
      Length field, with a constant of 8.  This value is identical to
      the Upper-Layer Packet Length field that would be returned by a
      compliant IPv6 UDP stack with no transport-layer payload
      [RFC2460].  (It differs from the value that would have been used
      by UDP-Lite, which utilises the length reported by the IP Module
      in the pseudo header).  Encapsulated packets need to include their
      own methods to verify integrity and correct payload length.

   o  The Next H value in the pseudo-header is the value specified for
      UDP (17 decimal).  This value will differ from the Next Header
      value in the IPv6 header if there are extension headers between
      the IPv6 header and the upper-layer header.

   Prior to computation, the Header Check field MUST be set to zero.  If
   the computed checksum is zero, it is transmitted as all ones (the
   equivalent in one's complement arithmetic) [RFC2460] specifies that
   IPv6 receivers must discard UDP datagrams containing a zero checksum,
   and should log the error.  This processing is preserved in this
   update.

   The way in which the Header check is computed in UDPTT will usually
   result in a constant value for each UDP flow.  This value may be
   cached as part of the tunnel endpoint flow state.  Once the tunnel
   has been created, a sender MAY insert the cached value instead of
   computing the checksum, and a receiver may then use a 16-bit
   comparison of the received value against the cached value, rather
   than a 1's complement checksum.  This approach may be desirable to
   minimise expensive computation in routers that need to handle many
   UDPTT flows operating at high rate.

2.6.  Multicast support for UDPTT

   Like UDP and UDP-Lite, UDPTT MAY be used as a transport for multicast
   datagrams.

3.  Using UDPTT

   This section provides information for implementors and users of
   UDPTT.

3.1.  UDPTT Usage Guidelines

   Implementors may use UDPTT in the same way as UDP providing that the
   application does not need UDPTT to validate the tunnel-encapsulated
   packet.  The protocol is not constrained to the semantics of one
   particular tunnel usage, and is believed compatible with a range of
   tunnel mechanisms.  If the tunnel requires greater assurance that
   tunnel-encapsulated packet is correct or has been delivered to the
   correct end point (e.g. where control data is carried over UDPTT),
   then the tunnel encapsulation MUST introduce its own integrity
   checks.  This is consistent with the expected behaviour of IETF-
   defined tunnel encapsulations.

   IPv6 Jumbograms are not supported in the UDPTT protocol.  If
   required, such packets may be sent using UDP.

   The UDP Usage Guidelines [RFC5405] provides guidance for application
   designers the use of UDP to support tunneling.  These guidelines also
   apply to this protocol.

   Unlike UDP, UDPTT does not validate the Length field of the IP header
   when calculating the transport checksum.  This design decision was
   driven by the goal that the checksum value should not normally change
   from packet to packet within a single transport flow.  The omission
   of this value is a relaxation of the integrity check.  Therefore:

   o  A tunnel receiver MUST discard UDPTT packets where the UDPTT
      payload size is less than the minimum required by the tunnelled
      protocol being transported.

   o  Application stacks SHOULD provide a way for a tunnel endpoint to
      identify whether UDPTT is to be used.  This could be identified by
      a socket option, or similar operating system mechanism.  A sender
      uses the socket option to include data in a UDPTT datagram (beyond
      the base UDP header), the receiver uses this to ensure the
      protocol stack passes data based on the Upper Layer payload,
      rather than the UDP header).

3.2.  Requirements for Tunnelled Protocols

   This section identifies the requirements for protocols transported
   within the payload of a UDPTT datagram.

Internet-Draft                    UDPTT                    February 2010


   Specifically, these requirements dictate that:

   o  An inner IPv4 (or IPv6) packet with a UDP checksum equal to zero
      MUST NOT be tunneled.

   o  The tunneling protocol and implementation MUST NOT be used to
      transport IPv4 or IPv6 packets that use network-layer
      fragmentation.

   o  A receiver MUST check the size of the tunnel-encapsulated packet
      based on information contained in the tunnel-encapsulated packet.
      A tunnel receiver MUST discard any tunnel-encapsulated packets
      where the reported length of the tunnelled packet is different to
      that reported by the IP module (reduced by the size of any header
      extensions present).

   o  A packet encapsulated over UDPTT MAY also use the UDPTT tunnel
      encapsulation mode, that is, tunnels may be recursively
      encpauslated.  However, the inner encapsulated packet MUST provide
      an integrity check of the transported payload information (e.g.
      the inner encapsulated IPv6 packet MUST NOT itself use UDPTT or be
      an IPv4 UDP datagram with the checksum disabled).

   o  A tunnel protocol that introduces control information MUST provide
      its own integrity check methods (e.g. validating the integrity of
      all control information and the length of the control packet).

   o  Non-IP inner packets MUST use a CRC or other mechanism for
      checking packet length and integrity.

3.3.  Backwards compatibility with RFC 2460

   There are three possible behaviours when a UDPTT datagram is received
   by an IPv6 host that only supports UDP as defined in [RFC2460].

   1.  A receiver checksum algorithm that uses the transport header
       Length field to calculate the UDP checksum (as defined for UDP in
       [RFC2460]) will result in a valid checksum.  However, the number
       of bytes forwarded to the upper layer, is dependent on how the
       payload length is interpreted when forwarding to the upper layer.
       An implementation could forward a number of bytes corresponding
       to the UDP Length field (i.e. 8 bytes), removing the payload
       part.  Since the UDP Length could be interpreted as indicating
       there is no payload part.  This behaviour would result in an
       application receiving null UDP datagrams.  Application designers
       are encouraged to design their applications to be robust to
       reception of such datagrams [RFC5405].  Since no data is passed
       to the application, there is no danger of inserting unwanted

       bytes into the data stream at the receiver.  This behaviour is
       safe, but no tunnel can be established until the stack is updated
       to support UDPTT.

   2.  A receiver with a checksum that uses the Upper-Layer Packet
       Length from the UDP Length field, and forwards a number of bytes
       corresponding to the IP Length field (less any extension headers
       present).  This receiver will calculate a correct checksum.  The
       transport layer will forward the UDP datagram towards the
       application with the payload part.  This is also the expected
       behaviour for UDPTT.  The application using the transport service
       will receive a set of bytes that are bit protected and therefore
       may have been modified in transit.  Since the UDP payload length
       is not verified, the number of bytes could also be modified in
       transit.  This behaviour may not be what was intended by a UDP
       application developer.  A tunnel application designed for UDPTT
       can use this behaviour.

   3.  A receiver with a checksum that uses the IP Length field is not
       compliant with UDP defined in [RFC2460]).  This receiver will
       silently discard the packet, because a mismatching pseudo header
       would cause the UDP checksum to fail.  This behaviour is safe,
       but no tunnel can be established until the stack is updated to
       support UDPTT.

3.4.   Middlebox Traversal and Incremental Checksum Update

   Middlebox traversal needs to be considered when planning the
   deployment of any new transport protocol.  Middleboxes are known to
   exist that verify the correctness of the UDP header.  Following
   publication of this specification it is expected that middleboxes
   will support UDPTT:

   o  Middleboxes MUST NOT truncate IPv6 datagrams the UDP Header Length
      is 8 and the IP length exceeds this length.

   o  If required to update the transport checksum (UDPTT Header Check),
      a middlebox MAY use the incremental checksum update procedure
      [RFC1141].

   o  If required to validate the transport checksum (UDPTT Header
      Check), a middlebox MUST use the method defined in this document
      for IPv6 packets with a UDP length of 8.

   This document does not modify the requirement that IPv6 receivers
   must discard UDP datagrams containing a zero checksum [RFC2460].

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA IPv6 Next Header registry entry for the decimal value 17
   needs to reference this document in addition to the RFC 2460.


6.  Security Considerations

   Transport checksums provide the first stage of protection for the
   stack, although they can not be considered authentication mechanisms.
   These checks are also desirable to ensure packet counters correctly
   log actual activity, and can spot unusual behaviours.

   Section 3.3 describes middlebox traversal.  Firewalls and other
   security devices may need to be updated to correctly process UDPTT
   datagrams.

   UDPTT presents a possibility of an attack where an attacker sends a
   flood of 'empty' UDPTT datagrams towards a tunnel endpoint.  Datagram
   applications should be designed to safely receive null datagrams,
   there is therefore no danger that the tunnel receiver will insert
   unwanted bytes in the application stream, such packets can contribute
   to the load of a receiving tunnel server and any middleboxes that
   process the UDPTT packet stream.

   Unlike UDP, the UDPTT Header Check does not validate the length field
   of the IP header when calculating the transport checksum.  This
   design decision was driven by the goal that the checksum value does
   not normally change from packet to packet within a single transport
   flow.  The omission of this value is a relaxation of the integrity
   check.  However, a UDPTT application is required to provide its own
   integrity check methods.  If the IP length field of a UDPTT datagram
   was modified in transit, a reduced value would result in "truncation"
   of the packet payload, whereas an increase in value would result in
   additional data after the intended payload.  Endpoints are required
   to discard any datagrams with an inconsistent length (after
   accounting for any extension headers that may be present).

   Endpoints that enable the use of UDPTT in the same port number range
   as used for UDP SHOULD provide a method to allow a sending and
   receiving application to indicate which port use a specific mode.

   This could be performed using a socket option call to allow an
   application to request use of the UDPTT semantics.

   UDPTT is compatible with the IPsec Encapsulation Security Protocol,
   ESP [RFC4303], and the Authentication Header, AH [RFC4302].  This may
   be used to encapsulated a UDPTT packet, although this introduces
   processing that may not be desirable in some deployment scenarios.
   IPsec may be used within a tunnel-encapsulated packet.

   A section describes issues relating to backwards compatibility in
   hosts.  This section may also be applicable to middleboxes that
   manipulate the transport-layer information.

Appendix A.  Why do we need a checksum?

   Guidance on the use of UDP checksums with IPv6 is provided in UDP
   [ID-UDP-Z].

   Previous research showed malformed packets can be received across the
   Internet, a side effect of broken internal processing (internal
   transfer errors) in routers or hosts.  When the checksum is used with
   UDP/IPv6, it significantly reduces the impact of such errors,
   reducing the probability of undetected corruption of state (and data)
   on both the host stack and the applications using the transport
   service.

   Corruption in the network may result in:

   o  a datagram being mis-delivered to the wrong host/router or the
      wring transport entity within a host/router.  Such a datagram
      should be discarded.

   o  a datagram payload being corrupted and delivered to the intended
      host/router transport entity.  Such a datagram needs to be either
      discarded or correctly processed by an application that has its
      own integrity checks.

   o  a datagram payload being truncated by corruption of the length
      field.  Such a datagram needs to be discarded.

   The decision to omit an integrity check at the IPv6 level means that
   the transport check is overloaded with many functions including
   validating:

   o  the endpoint address was not corrupted within a router - this
      packet was meant for this destination and a wrong header has not
      been spliced to a different payload.

   o  the extension header processing is correctly delimited - the start
      of data has not been corrupted.  The protocol types does this also



Fairhurst                Expires August 14, 2010               [Page 13]

      to some extent.

   o  reassembly processing, when used.

   o  the length of the payload.

   o  the port values - i.e. the correct application gets the payload
      (applications should also check source ports/address).

   o  the payload integrity.

   In IPv4, the first 4 checks are made by the IPv4 header checksum.

   In IPv6, this checking occurs within the stack using the UDP checksum
   information.  UDPTT also performs these checks (with the exception of
   the length field, which UDPTT performs using the tunnel encapsulated
   packet).

   An IPv6 node also relies on the header information to determine
   whether to send an ICMPv6 error message and to determine the node to
   which this is sent.  Corrupted information may lead to misdelivery to
   an unintended application socket on an unexpected host.

   In tunnel encapsulations, payload integrity and length verification
   may be provided by higher layer tunnel encapsulations (often using
   the IPv4, UDP, UDP-Lite, or TCP checksums).

   There are implications on the detectability of mis-delivery of a
   packet to an incorrect endpoint/socket, and the robustness of the
   Internet infrastructure.

   The IETF has defined other tunneling protocols that do not include a
   check value.  However, these are typically layered directly over the
   Internet layer (identified by the upper layer type field) and are not
   also used as endpoint transport protocols.  Specifically packets are
   only delivered to protocol modules that process a specific next
   header value.  The next header field therefore provides a first-level
   check of correct demultiplexing.  Since the UDP port space is shared
   many diverse application, this check is not available when UDP is
   used as transport and therefore the demultiplexing relies solely on
   the destination port number.

   Deterministic reporting of statistics is desirable: router/endpoint
   MIBs and other statistics gathering methods have the ability to
   detect this type of error, rather than recording this as valid
   traffic between spurious endpoints.

   Some IPv6 aware middleware and firewalls may drop or truncate UDPTT

   {Note: The author would be glad to know of specific cases of
   truncation and other behaviours.}

A.1.  IPv4 Compatibility

   The current version of this document does not specify encapsulation
   using IPv4 [RFC0791].  For this network protocol.  UDP is permitted
   to disable the UDP checksum and rely on the IPv4 header checksum.

   {Note: Future versions of this document could also consider support
   for IPv4 if the WG considers this useful|}

A.2.  Why not set the IPv6 UDP checksum to zero?

   {This section to be expanded in future revisions}

   Topics to be discussed:

   o  The role of a router and host are not fixed.  It can not be
      assumed that a particular protocol (or transport mode) will only
      be used on a specific type of network node (e.g. the UDP checksum
      can be disabled only on a router).  In IPv6, a node may select a
      role of a router or host on a per interface basis.  Protocol
      changes intended for one specific use are often re-used for
      different applications.

   o  Why ignore checksum on reception is niave

   o  Behaviour of NAT/Middleboxes needs to be updated for UDPTT and for
      UDP cksum==0

   o  Implications on host acting as routers and transport end points.

   o  Requires restrictions on recursive tunnels that are not necessary
      with UDPTT


Appendix B.  Applicability for AMT

   This specification is intended to be suited to use with "Automatic IP
   Multicast Without Explicit Tunnels", also known as "AMT".  AMT
   currently specifies UDP as the transport protocol for tunneled
   packets; that is, the outer packet carrying a tunneled (inner)
   packet.  The specification is for packets carrying tunneled multicast
   data only.  In AMT, the UDP checksum in the UDP header of the outer
   packet SHOULD be 0 (See draft-ietf-mboned-auto-multicast-09, Section

   6.6).  However RFC 2460 (IPv6) explicitly states that IPv6 receivers
   MUST discard UDP packets with a 0 checksum.  So, while sending a UDP
   packet with a 0 checksum is permitted in IPv4 packets, it is
   explicitly forbidden in IPv6 packets.  The computation of an
   additional checksum, when the inner packet(s) are already adequately
   protected, is seen to be an unwarranted burden on nodes implementing
   lightweight tunneling protocols.

   The intention is that UDPTT offers a safe alternate approach to the
   IPv6 method currently defined in AMT.

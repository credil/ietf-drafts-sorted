      <t>This document specifies the "Mutual authentication protocol for
Hyper-Text Transport Protocol".  This protocol provides true
mutual authentication between HTTP clients and servers using
simple password-based authentication.  Unlike Basic and Digest HTTP
access authentication protocol, the protocol ensures that server
knows the user's entity (encrypted password) upon successful
authentication.  This prevents common phishing attacks: phishing
attackers cannot convince users that the user has been authenticated to
the genuine website.  Furthermore, even when a user has been authenticated
against an illegitimate server, the server cannot gain any bit of
information about user's passwords. The protocol is designed
as an extension to the HTTP protocol, and the protocol design intends to replace
existing authentication mechanism such as Basic/Digest access authentications
and form-based authentications.

<section title="Introduction">

     <t>This document specifies the "Mutual authentication protocol for
     Hyper-Text Transport Protocol".  This protocol provides true
     mutual authentication between HTTP clients and servers
     using simple password-based authentication.  Unlike <xref target="RFC2617">Basic and
     Digest HTTP access authentication protocol</xref>, the protocol ensures
     that server knows the user's entity (encrypted password)
     upon successful authentication.  This prevents common phishing
     attacks: phishing attackers cannot convince users that the user
     has been authenticated to the genuine website.  Furthermore, even
     when a user has been authenticated against an illegitimate server,
     the server cannot gain any bit of information about user's
     passwords.</t>

     <t>Recently, phishing attacks are getting more and more
     sophisticated.  Phishers not only steal user's password directly,
     but imitate successful authentication to steal user's sensitive
     information, check the password validity by forwarding the
     password to the legitimate server, or employ a man-in-the-middle
     attack to hijack user's login session.  Existing countermeasures
     such as one-time passwords cannot completely solve these
     problems.</t>

     <t>
     The protocol prevents such attacks by providing users a way to
     discriminate between true and fake web servers using their own
     passwords.  Even when a user inputs his/her password to a fake
     website, using this authentication method, any information about
     the password does not leak to the phisher, and the user certainly
     notices that the mutual authentication has failed.  Phishers
     cannot make such authentication attempt succeed, even if they
     forward received data from a user to the legitimate server or
     vice versa.  Users can safely input sensitive data to the web
     forms after confirming that the mutual authentication has
     succeeded.
     </t>

     <t>To achieve this goal, this protocol uses a mechanism in <xref target="ISO.11770-4.2006">ISO/IEC
        11770-4</xref>, a kind of PAKE (Password-Authenticated Key Exchange)
        authentication algorithms as a basis.  The use of PAKE
        mechanism allows users to use familiar ID/password based
        accesses, without fear of leaking any password information to
        the communication peer.  The protocol, as a whole, is designed
        as a natural extension to the <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP protocol</xref>.
     </t>
     <t>
        The design also considers to replace current form-based Web authentication,
        which is very vulnerable against phishing attacks.
        To this purpose, several extensions to <xref target="RFC2617">current
        HTTP authentication mechanism</xref> are introduced.

<section anchor="protocol-overview" title="Protocol Overview">

<t>The following sequence is a typical sequence for the first access to the resource.

<list style="symbols">
   <t>  If the server (S) has received a request for mutual-authentication
       protected resources from the Client (C) (which is not a req-A1
       nor a req-A3 message), it sends a 401-B0 message to C.
       <vspace blankLines="1" />
       When C has received a 401-B0 message, C SHOULD check validity of the message.
       If succeed, C processes the body of the message, and enables the password entry field.
   </t>
   <t>  If the user has input the username and password as a response to
       the 401-B0 message, C creates a value s_A, calculates
       the value w_A, and then constructs and sends a req-A1 message.
   </t>

   <t>  If S has received a req-A1 message,
       S should check validity of w_A, record the received w_A value,
       and then look up the username from the
       user table. if the user is found, S prepares a
       new session id (sid), records it into a session table, and then
       constructs s_B, calculates w_B, and sends a 401-B1 message.
       <vspace blankLines="1" />
       If there is no matching user found, the server SHOULD construct
       a fake w_B value, and let the protocol going on by sending an
       401-B1 message.
   </t>

   <t>  When C has received a 401-B1 message as a response for a req-A1 message,
       C should check validity of w_B, and compute z and o_A, and send
       a req-A3 message.
       <vspace blankLines="1" />
       If C receives any messages other than
       401-B1, C MUST NOT process the message body and treat
       it as a fatal communication error condition.  This case includes
       the reception of HTTP OK (200-status) message.
   </t>

   <t>  If S has received a req-A3 message, S should look up the
       received sid from the session table.  If there is no matching sid,
       or if S has not received the corresponding req-A1
       message beforehand, S SHOULD send a 401-B0-stale message.
       <vspace blankLines="1" />
       Otherwise, S should compute o_A and check its value.
       If the validation has failed, it means that the authentication has been
       failed. The server SHOULD send a 401-B0 message.
       <vspace blankLines="1" />
       If the validation has succeeded, the server SHOULD calculate
       o_B, and send a 200-B4 message.
   </t>

   <t> In a response to a req-B1 message, when C has received a 401-B0 message, it means that the
       authentication has been failed, possibly due to that the wrong
       password has been given.  C MAY ignore the body of the 401-B0
       message in this case.
       <vspace blankLines="1" />
       When C has received a 200-B4 message,
       C MUST first compute the value of o_B and validate
       the value o_B sent from the server.
       If it has not verified successfully, C MUST ignore the
       body of the message, and treat the situation as a fatal communication error
       condition.  If the verification has succeed, C will process the body
       of the message.
       <vspace blankLines="1" />
       If C receives any messages other than 401-B0 or
       valid 200-B4, C MUST NOT process the message body and other headers and treat
       it as a fatal communication error condition.  This case includes
       the reception of usual HTTP OK (200-status) messages.
   </t>
   </list>
</t>

<t>
For the second or later request to the server, if the client knows that
the resource is likely to require the authentication, the client MAY
omit first unauthenticated request and send req-A1 message immediately.
In this case, the first (and only the first) response from the server MAY be a normal,
unauthenticated message, and client MAY accept such messages.
</t>
<t>
Furthermore, if client owns a valid session ID (sid), the client MAY
send a req-A3 message using existing sid.
In such cases, the server MAY have been thrown out the corresponding sessions from the session table.
In this case, the server SHOULD send a 401-B0-stale message as a response to
req-A3 message, and C SHOULD retry from constructing a req-A1 message.
</t>

<section anchor="syntax" title="Message Syntax">

<t>
The Mutual authentication protocol uses five headers: WWW&nbhy;Authenticate
(in responses with status code 401), Optional&nbhy;WWW&nbhy;Authenticate (in
responses with positive status codes), Authentication-Control (in responses), Authorization (in requests),
and Authentication-info (in positive responses).  These five headers
share the common syntax described in <xref target="figure-syntax" />.
The syntax is denoted in the augmented BNF syntax defined in <xref target="RFC5234" />.
The syntax is a subset of the one described in <xref target="RFC2617" />.

<section title="Tokens and Extensive-tokens">

<t>
The tokens MUST be interpreted case-insensitively, and SHOULD be sent
in the same case as shown in the specification.  When these are used
as (partial) inputs to any hash or other mathematical functions,
it MUST be used in lower-case.  All hex-fixed-number or
hex-integer numbers are also case-insensitive, and SHOULD be sent in
lower-case.
</t>

<t>
Extensive-tokens are used where the set of acceptable tokens are
extensible.  Any non-standard extensions of this protocol MUST use the
extension-tokens of format "&lt;token&gt;@&lt;domain-name&gt;", where domain-name is
the valid registered (sub-)domain name on the Internet owned by the
party who defines extensions.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Numbers" anchor="sec-numbers">

<t>
The syntax definitions of integer and
hex-integer only allow representations
which do not contain extra leading 0s.
</t>

<t>
The numbers represented as a hex-fixed-number MUST have even
characters (i.e. multiple of eight bits).  When these are generated
from cryptographic values, those SHOULD have the natural length:
if these are generated from a hash function, these lengths SHOULD
correspond to the hash size; if these are representing elements of a
mathematical group, its lengths SHOULD be the shortest which can
represent all elements in the group. See <xref target="other-values" />
for information about the length of the fields used in this specification.
Other values such as session-id
are represented in any (even) length determined by the side who
generates it first, and the same length SHALL be used throughout the
whole communications by both peers.
</t>

<t>
The numbers represented as a base64-fixed-number SHALL be generated as follows:
first, the number is converted to a big-endian octet-string
representation.  The length of the representation is determined in the
same way as above.  Then, the string is encoded by <xref target="RFC4648">the Base 64 encoding</xref>, and then
enclosed by two double-quotations.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Strings">

<t>
All strings outside ASCII or equivalent character sets SHOULD be
encoded using <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8 encoding</xref>
of the <xref target="ISO.10646-1.1993">ISO 10646-1 character set</xref>.
Both peers SHOULD reject any invalid UTF-8 sequences which causes
decoding ambiguities (e.g. containing &lt;&quot;&gt; in the
second or later byte of the UTF-8 encoded characters).
To encode character strings, these will first be encoded according to UTF-8 without leading BOM, then
all occurrences of characters &lt;&quot;&gt; and
"\" will be escaped by prepending "\", and
two &lt;&quot;&gt;s will be put around the string.
If the contents of the strings are comma-separated values, the commas
in the values are also quoted by "\".
</t>

<t>
If strings are representing a domain name or URI which contains
non-ASCII characters, the host parts SHOULD be encoded
using puny-code defined in <xref target="RFC3492" /> instead of UTF-8, and SHOULD use lower-case ASCII characters.
</t>

<t>
For Base64-fixed-numbers, which use the string syntax, see the previous section.
</t>

<section title="Messages" anchor="messages">

<t>
In this section, formats and requirements of the headers for each
message are presented. The allowed type of values for each header
field is shown in parenthesis after the key names.  The type
"algorithm-determined" means that the acceptable value type for the

<section title="Authentication-Control header" anchor="auth-control-header">

<t>
The Authentication-Control header gives more precise control for the
client behavior for Web applications using Mutual Access Control Protocol.
This headers may usually be generated in an application layer, as opposed to
WWW-Authenticate headers which will be generated by Web servers.
</t>

<t>
Support of this header is OPTIONAL for interactive clients and
not required for non-interactive clients.
Web applications SHOULD consider security impacts of behavior of clients 
which do not support this header.
</t>

<t>
The "auth-scheme" of this header and other authentication-related headers
within the same message MUST be equal.
This document does not define any behavior associated with this header,
when the "auth-scheme" of this header is not "Mutual".
</t>

<section title="Location-when-unauthenticated field" anchor="auth-control-loc-unauth">
<t>
Authentication-Control: Mutual 
        location-when-unauthenticated="http://www.example.com/login.html"
</t>

<t>
The field "location-when-unauthenticated" specifies a location which
any unauthenticated users of clients should be redirected to.
This header may be used, for example, when there is a central login page
for the whole Web application.
The value of this field MUST be a string contains an absolute URL location.
If a given URL is not absolute, clients MAY consider it as a relative URL
from the current location.
This fields SHOULD only be used with 401-B0 messages; use of this header
with 200-optional-B0 messages are not recommended.
</t>
<t>
When a client receives a message with this field, if and only if the
client's state after the processing the response is either 12 or 13
(i.e., a state in which the client will process response body and ask
user's password), the client will treat the whole response as if it
were a 303 "See Other" response with a Location header with the
value of this field (i.e., client will be redirected to the specified
location with a GET request).  Unlike a normal 303 response, if the
client can proceed authentication without user's interaction (like
states 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10), this field is ignored.
</t>
<t>
The specified location SHOULD be included in a set of locations specified
in the "auth-domain" field of the corresponding 401-B0 message. If this 
is not satisfied, clients MAY ignore this field.
</t>
<t>
If there is a 200-B4, 401-B0-stale or 401-B1 message with this field, 
clients MUST ignore this field.
</t>
</section>

<t>
Authentication-Control: Mutual 
        location-when-logout="http://www.example.com/byebye.html"
</t>

<t>
The field "location-when-logout" specifies a location where
the client is to be redirected when users request logout explicitly.
The value of this field MUST be a string contains an absolute URL location.
If a given URL is not absolute, clients MAY consider it as a relative URL
from the current location.
This fields SHOULD only be used with 200-B4 messages.
</t>
<t>
When users of a client request to terminate an authentication session,
and if the client currently displays a page supplied by a response 
with this field, the client will be redirected to the specified location
by a new GET request (like received a 303 response), instead of reloading
the page without authentication credentials. It is recommendable for Web
applications to send this field with an appropriate value for any responses
for non-GET requests.
</t>
<t>
If there is a 401-B0, 401-B1, 401-B0-stale or normal 200 message with
this field, clients MUST ignore this field.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Logout-timeout" anchor="auth-control-logout-timeout">
<t>

<t>
The field "logout-timeout" has the same meaning as the field of the

<section title="Authentication Algorithms" anchor="algorithm">

<t>
This document specifies only one family of the authentication
algorithm.  The family consists of four authentication algorithms,
which only differ in underlying mathematical groups and security
parameters.  The algorithms do not add any additional fields.  The
tokens for algorithms are
<list style="symbols">
 <t> "iso11770-4-ec-p256" for the 256-bit prime-field elliptic-curve setting.</t>
 <t> "iso11770-4-ec-p521" for the 521-bit prime-field elliptic-curve setting.</t>
 <t> "iso11770-4-dl-2048" for the 2048-bit discrete-logarithm setting.</t>
 <t> "iso11770-4-dl-4096" for the 4096-bit discrete-logarithm setting.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
For the elliptic-curve settings, the underlying fields and the curves used
for elliptic-curve cryptography are the prime field and the Curve P-256
and P-521, respectively, specified in the appendix of <xref target="FIPS.186-2.2000">FIPS PUB 186-2</xref>
specification.  The hash functions H are SHA-256 for P-256 curve and
SHA-512 for P-521 curve, respectively, defined in <xref target="FIPS.180-2.2002">FIPS PUB 180-2</xref>.
The representation of fields wa, wb, oa, and ob is hex-fixed-number.
</t>

<t>
For discrete-logarithm settings, the underlying groups are 2048-bit
and 4096-bit MODP groups defined in <xref target="RFC3526" /> respectively.
See <xref target="modp-groups" /> for the exact specification of the group
and associated parameters.
The hash functions H are SHA-256 for the
2048-bit field and SHA-512 for the 4096-bit field, respectively.
The representation of fields wa, wb, oa, and ob is base64-fixed-number.
</t>

<t>
The clients SHOULD support at least "iso11770-4-dl-2048"
algorithm, and are advised to support all of the above four algorithms whenever possible.
The server software implementations SHOULD support at least "iso11770-4-dl-2048"
algorithm, unless it is known that users will not use it.
</t>

<t>
This algorithm uses Key Agreement Mechanism 3 (KAM3) defined in Section 6.3 of <xref target="ISO.11770-4.2006">ISO/IEC-11770-4</xref> as a basis.
</t>

<section title="Common functions">

<t>
The password-based string pi used by this authentication is derived in the
following manner:
</t>

<t>
 pi = H(VS(algorithm) | VS(auth-domain) | VS(realm) | VS(username) | VS(ph(password)).
</t>

<t>
The values of algorithm, realm and auth-domain are taken from the values contained
in the 401-B0 message.
When pi is used in the context of an octet string, it SHALL have
the natural length derived from the size of the output of function
H (e.g. 32 octets for SHA-256).  The function ph is defined by
the value of the pwd-hash field given in a 401-B0 message.
</t>

<t>The function VI encodes natural numbers into octet strings in the following manner:
integers are represented in
big-endian radix-128 string, where each digit is represented by a octet
0x80&ndash;0xff except the last digit represented by 0x00&ndash;0x7f.
The first octet MUST NOT be 0x80.
For example, VI(i) = octet(i) for i < 128,
and VI(i) = octet(0x80 | (i &gt;&gt; 7)) | octet(i &amp; 127) for 128 &lt;= i < 16384.
This encoding is the same as the one used for subcomponents of object identifiers in <xref target="ITU.X690.1994">the ASN.1 encoding</xref>.
</t>

<t>
The function VS encodes variable-length octet string into decodable
octet string, as in the following manner:
</t>

<t>
 VS(s) = VI(length(s)) | s
</t>

<t>
where length(s) is a number of octets (not characters) in s.
</t>

<t>The function OCTETS converts an integer to corresponding radix-256
big-endian octet string having its natural length:
See <xref target="sec-numbers" /> for the definition of the "natural length".
Note that this is different from the function
GE2OS_x in <xref target="ISO.11770-4.2006" />, which takes
the shortest representation.</t>

<t>
The equations for J, w_A, T, z, and w_B are specified differently
for the discrete-logarithm setting and the elliptic-curve setting
based on <xref target="ISO.11770-4.2006" />. These equations are
defined later in this section.
</t>

<t>
The values o_A and o_B are derived by the following equation.
Note that these equations are different from ones specified in <xref target="ISO.11770-4.2006" />.
</t>

<t>
 o_A = H(octet(04) | OCTETS(w_A) | OCTETS(w_B) | OCTETS(z) | VI(nc) | VS(v))
<vspace blankLines="1" />
 o_B = H(octet(03) | OCTETS(w_A) | OCTETS(w_B) | OCTETS(z) | VI(nc) | VS(v))

In addition, s_A MUST be larger than log(q)/log(g) 
(so that g^(s_A) > q).
</t>

<t>
The value of w_A SHALL satisfy 1 < w_A < q-1.
The server MUST check this condition upon reception.
</t>

<t>
The value of w_B is derived from J(pi) and w_A as:
</t>

<t>
w_B = (J(pi) * w_A^(H(octet(1) | OCTETS(w_A))))^s_B mod q,

The value of w_B MUST satisfy 1 < w_B < q-1.
If this condition is not hold, the server MUST retry
with another value of s_B.
The client MUST check this condition upon reception.
</t>

<t>
The value z in the client side is derived by the following equation:
</t>

<t>
z = w_B^((s_A + H(octet(2) | OCTETS(w_A) | OCTETS(w_B))) / (s_A * H(octet(1) | w_A) + pi) mod r) mod q.

The function P(p) converts a curve point p to an integer representing the point p,
by computing x * 2 + (y mod 2), where (x, y) are the coordinates of the point p.
P'(z) is the inverse of function P, that is, it converts an integer z
to a point p which satisfies P(p) = z.  If such p is exist, it is
uniquely defined.  Otherwise, z does not represent a valid curve point.
The operation [x] * p denotes an integer-multiplication of point p:
it calculates p + p + ... (x times) ... + p.
See literatures on elliptic-curve cryptography for the exact algorithms for those.
0_E represents the infinity point.
The equation (x / y mod z) denotes an natural number w less than z which satisfies

<section title="Authentication Realms" anchor="authrealm">

<t>
In this protocol, an "authentication realm" is defined as a set of resources (URIs)
for which the same set of user names and passwords is valid for.
If the server requests authentication for the authentication realm 
which the client is already authenticated, the client will automatically
perform authentication  using the already-known secrets.
On the contrary, for the different authentication realms, clients SHOULD NOT 
automatically reuse the usernames and passwords for another realm.
</t>

<t>
Just like Basic and Digest access authentication protocol, Mutual
authentication protocol supports multiple, separate authentication
realms to be set up inside each hosts.  Furthermore, the protocol supports
that a single authentication realm spans over several hosts in the same
Internet domain.
</t>

<t>
Each authentication realm is defined and distinguished by the triple of an "authentication algorithm",
an "authentication domain", a "realm" parameter.  Server operators are
NOT RECOMMENDED to use the same pair of an authentication domain and a
realm for different authentication algorithms, however.
</t>

<t>
Authentication algorithms are defined in <xref target="messages" /> and <xref target="algorithm" />.
Realm parameters are just a string, as defined in <xref target="messages" />.
Authentication domains are described in the rest of this section.
</t>

<t>
An authentication domain specifies the range of hosts which the authentication realm spans over.
In the protocol, it MUST currently be one of the following strings.

<list style="symbols" hangIndent="3">
  <t>the string in format 
     "&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;", where scheme, host and
     port are the URI parts of the requested URI.
     Even if the request-URI does not have a port part, the
     string will include the one (i.e. 80 for http and 443 for https).
     Use this when authentication is only valid for specific protocol (such as https).
  </t>
  <t>The "host" part of the requested URI. This is the default value.
     Authentication realms in this kind of authentication domain will span over
     several protocols (i.e. http and https) and ports, but not over different hosts.
  </t>
  <t>String in format "*.&lt;domain-postfix&gt;", where "domain-postfix" is
     either the host part of the requested URI, or any domain in which
     the requested host is included (this means that the specification "*.example.com" is
     valid for all of hosts "www.example.com", "web.example.com" and "example.com").
     The domain-postfix must be equal to or included in a valid Internet domain assigned to
     specific organization: if the clients can know by some way (such as blacklists for HTTP cookies)
     that the specified domain is not to be assigned to any specific organization
     (e.g. "*.com" or "*.jp"), the client is RECOMMENDED to reject the authentication request.
  </t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
In the above specifications, every "scheme", "host" and "domain" MUST be in lower-case,
and IDNs MUST be represented in <xref target="RFC3492">puny-code</xref>.
All "port"s MUST be in the shortest, unsigned, decimal number notation.
Not obeying these requirements will cause failure of valid authentication attempts.
</t>

<section title="Resolving ambiguities">
<t>
In the above definition of authentication domains, several domains will overwrap each other.
Depending on the "path" parameters given in the "401-B1" message (see <xref target="messages" />),
There may be several candidate when the client is to send a request with authentication 
credentials included (at the Steps 3 and 4 of the decision procedure shown in <xref target="cli-decision" />).
</t>

<t>
If such choices are required, the following procedure SHOULD be followed.
<list style="symbols" hangIndent="3">
  <t> If the client has previously sent a request to the same URI, and
      it remembers the authentication realm requested by 401-B0 messages at that time,
      use that realm.
  </t>
  <t>
      In other cases, use one of authentication realms which represents
      most-specific authentication domains.
      In the list of possible domain specifications shown above,
      one described earlier has priority over ones described after that.
      <vspace blankLines="1" />
      If there are several choices with different domain-postfix specifications,
      the one which has longer domain possible has priority over ones with
      shorter domain-postfix.
  </t>
  <t>
      If there are realms with the same specifications of authentication domain,
      there is no defined priority: client MAY choose any one of possible choices.
  </t>
</list>
If possible, server operators are recommended to avoid such ambiguities by setting
"path" parameters properly.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Validation Methods" anchor="validation">

<t>
The "validation method" specifies a method to "relate" the mutual
authentication processed by this protocol with other authentications
already performed in the underlying layers and to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
It decides the value of v which is an input to authentication protocols.
</t>

<t>
The valid tokens for the validation field and corresponding values of v
are as follows:
</t>

<t>
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="15">
 <t hangText="host:"> hostname validation: v will be the ASCII string in the
       following format: "scheme://host:port", where scheme, host and port 
       are the URI parts correspond to the currently accessing resource.
       The scheme and host are lower-case, and the port is in a shortest
       decimal representation.  Even if the request-URI does not have a
       port part, v will include the one.</t>
 <t hangText="tls-cert:"> TLS certificate validation: v will be the octet string of
       the hash value of the public key certificate used in underlying
       <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> (or SSL) connection.
       The hash value is defined as the value of the whole signed certificate
       (specified as "Certificate" in <xref target="RFC5280" />),
       hashed by the hash algorithm specified by the authentication algorithm used.
 </t>
 <t hangText="tls-key:"> TLS shared-key validation: v will be the octet string of
       the shared master secret negotiated in underlying TLS (or SSL) connection.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
If the HTTP protocol is used on unencrypted channel, the validation type
MUST be "host".  If <xref target="RFC2818">HTTP/TLS</xref> (https) protocol is
used with server certificates, the validation type MUST be either "tls-cert" or
"tls-key".  If HTTP/TLS protocol is used with anonymous
Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the validation type MUST be
"tls-key" (but see the note below).
</t>

<t>
Clients MUST validate this field upon reception of 401-B0 messages.
</t>

<t>
However, when the protocol is used on web browsers with any scripting
capabilities, the anonymous Diffie-Hellman family of TLS (or SSL) cipher-suite
MUST NOT be used even if "tls-key" validated Mutual
authentication has been employed, and the certificate shown in TLS (or SSL)
negotiation MUST be verified using PKI. For other systems, if the
"tls-key" validation is used on TLS (or SSL) protocol without
certificate verification using PKI, those systems MUST ensure that all
transactions with authenticated peer servers MUST use and be validated by
the Mutual authentication protocol, regardless of the existence of the
401-B0 responses.
</t>

<t>
The protocol defines two variants for validation on TLS connections.
The method "tls-key" method is more secure.  However, there are some situations
where tls-cert is more preferable.
<list style="symbols">
<t>When TLS accelerating proxies are used.  In this case, it is
difficult for the authenticating server to acquire the TLS key
information which are used between the client and the proxy.
It is not the case for client-side "tunneling" proxies using
CONNECT method extension of HTTP.
</t>
<t>When a black-box implementation of the TLS protocol is used on
either peer.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Implementations supporting Mutual authentication over https protocol SHOULD support
"tls-cert" validation unless it is not applicable.
Support for "tls-key" validation is OPTIONAL for both servers and clients.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Session Management" anchor="session">

<t>
In the Mutual authentication protocol, a session represented by a sid is generated
By the first 4 messages (first request, 401-B0, req-A1 and 401-B1).
This session can be used
for one or more requests for resources protected by the same realm in the
same server. Note that the session management is only an inside detail of the
protocol and usually not visible to normal users.  If a session expires,
the client and server will automatically reestablish another session
without telling it to the users.
</t>

<t>
The server SHOULD accept at least one req-A3 request for each session,
given that the request reaches the server in a time window specified
by the timeout field in the 401-B1 message, and that there are
no emergent reasons (such as flooding attacks) to forget the sessions.
After that, the server MAY discard any session at any time and MAY send
401-B0-stale messages for any req-A3 requests.
</t>

<t>
The client MAY send more than one requests using a single session
specified by the sid.  However, for all such requests, the values of the
nonce-counter (nc field) MUST be different from each other.  The server
MUST check for duplication of the received nonces, and if any
duplication is detected, the server MUST discard the session and respond
by a 401-B0-stale message.
</t>

<t>
In addition, for each sessions, if the client has already sent a request
with nonce value x, it SHOULD NOT send requests with a nonce value not
larger than (x - nc-window). The server MAY reject
any requests with nonces violating this rule with 401-B0-stale responses.
This restriction enables servers to implement duplicated nonce detection
in a constant memory.
</t>

<t>
Values of nonces and nonce-related values MUST always be treated as
natural numbers within infinite range.  Implementations using fixed-width
integers or fixed-precision floating numbers MUST handle integer
overflow correctly and carefully.  Such implementations are RECOMMENDED
to accept any larger values which cannot be represented in
the fixed-width integer representations, as long as other limits such as
internal header-length restrictions are not involved.
The protocol is designed carefully so that both clients and servers
can implement the protocol only with
fixed-width integers, by rounding any
overflowed values to the maximum possible value.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Optional Mutual Authentication" anchor="opt-mutual-auth">

<t>
In several Web applications, users can access the same contents both as
a guest user and as a authenticated users.  In usual Web applications,
it is implemented using Cookies and custom form-based authentications.
The new method of authentication described in this section provides a replacement for
those authentication systems. The support for this extension is RECOMMENDED,
unless an authentication is mandatory for some specific applications.
</t>

<t>
Servers MAY send HTTP successful responses (response code 200, 206 and others)
containing the Optional&nbhy;WWW&nbhy;Authenticate header, when it is allowed to send
401-B0 responses and the requests do not contain Authentication-Info: headers.
Such responses are hereafter called 200-Optional-B0 responses.
</t>

<t>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK<vspace blankLines="0" />
Optional-WWW-Authenticate: Mutual algorithm=xxxx, validation=xxxx,
                           realm="xxxx", stale=0
</t>

<t>
The fields contained in the Optional&nbhy;WWW&nbhy;Authenticate header is the same as
the 401-B0 message described in <xref target="401-B0" />.
The client software supporting the mutual authentication protocol receiving
a 200-Optional-B0 message will process the contents of the message and
enables an authentication input field.
</t>

<t>
When the user input the username and password, the client resends the
request with a req-A1 header.  The server MUST respond with a 401-B1
message.  In terms of the state management in <xref target="cli-decision" />,
200-Optional-B0 responses are treated as if they were 401-B0 responses:
these messages SHOULD NOT be sent as a response to
req-A1 and req-A3 messages, unless the authentication realm sent from
the client or indicated by sid is different from the one which the server expects.
</t>

<t>
Servers requesting optional mutual authentication SHOULD send the path
field in 401-B1 messages with an appropriate value.  Client software
supporting optional mutual authentication MUST recognize the
field, and MUST send either req-A1 or
req-A3 request for the URI space inside the specified paths, instead
of unauthenticated requests.
</t>

<section title="Methods to extend this protocol">

<t>
If a non-standard extension to the this protocol is implemented,
it MUST use the extension-tokens defined in
<xref target="syntax" /> to avoid conflicts with this protocol and other
extensions.
</t>

<t>
Authentication algorithms other than those defined in this document
MAY use other representations for keys "wa", "wb", "oa" and "ob",
replace those keys, and/or add fields to the messages containing those
fields by supplemental specifications.  If those specifications use
keys other than shown above, it is RECOMMENDED to use
extension-tokens to avoid any key-name conflict with the future
extension of this protocol.
</t>

<t>
Extension-tokens MAY be freely used for any non-standard,
private and/or experimental uses for those fields provided that the
domain part in the token is appropriately used.

</section>

<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
<t>The tokens used for authentication-algorithm, pwd-hash, and

<section title="General Assumptions">

<t>
<list style="symbols">
 <t>
  The protocol is secure against passive eavesdropping and replay attacks.
  However, the protocol relies on transport security including DNS security for active attacks.
  HTTP/TLS SHOULD be used where transport security
  is not assured and data secrecy is important.
 </t>

 <t>
  Used with HTTP/TLS, if TLS server certificates are reliably
  verified, the protocol gives true protection against active
  man-in-the-middle attacks.
 </t>

 <t>
  Even if the server certificate is not used or is unreliable, the
  protocol gives protection against active man-in-the-middle attacks
  for each HTTP request/response pair.  However, in such cases,
  JavaScript or similar scripting facilities can be used to affect
  Mutually-authenticated contents from other contents not protected by this
  authentication mechanism.  This is the reason why this protocol requires that valid
  TLS server certificates MUST be presented (<xref target="validation" />).
 </t>

</list>

</section>

<section title="Implementation Considerations">

<t>
<list style="symbols">
 <t>   To securely implement the protocol, the Authentication-Info
       headers in the 200-B4 messages MUST always be validated by the
       client. If the validation is failed, the client MUST NOT process
       any content sent with the message, including the body part.
       Non-compliance to this will enable phishing attacks.
</t>

<t>
       The authentication status on the client-side SHOULD be visible to
       the users of the client.  In addition, the method for asking
       user's name and passwords SHOULD be carefully designed so that
       (1) the user can easily distinguish request of this
       authentication methods from other existing authentication
       methods such as Basic and Digest methods, and (2) the Web contents cannot
       imitate the user-interfaces of this protocol.
       <vspace blankLines="1" />
       An informational memo regarding user-interface considerations
       and recommendations for implementing this protocol will be
       separately published.

       For HTTP/TLS communications, when a web form is submitted from
       Mutually-authenticated pages with the validation methods of
       "tls-cert" to a URI which is protected by the same realm (so
       indicated by the path field), if server certificate
       has been changed since the pages has been received, the peer
       is RECOMMENDED to be revalidated using a req-A1 message with an
       "Expect: 100-continue" header.  The same applies when the
       page is received with the validation methods of "tls-key", and
       when the TLS session has been expired.

  sharing the same auth-domain.  This means that when host-type auth-domain
  is used for authentication in HTTPS site, and when an HTTP server on the
  same host requests Mutual authentication with the same realm, 
  the client will send the user-name in a clear text.
  If user-names have to kept secret against eavesdropping,
  the server must use full-scheme-type auth-domain parameter.
  On the contrary, passwords are not exposed to eavesdroppers even on HTTP requests.
 </t>
 <t>
  "Pwd_hash" field is only provided for backward compatibility
  for password databases, and using "none" function is the mostly secure choice and RECOMMENDED.
  If values other than "none" is used, you must ensure that
  the hash values of the passwords were not exposed to the public.
  Note that hashed password databases for plain-text authentications
  are usually not considered secret.
 </t>
<t>
       If the server provides several ways of storing server-side
       password database, it is advised to store the values 
       encrypted by one-way function J(pi),
       instead of the real passwords, those hashed by ph, or pi.

                       A SASL Mechanism for SAML
                  draft-wierenga-ietf-sasl-saml-01.txt

Abstract

   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) has found its usage on the
   Internet for Web Single Sign-On.  Simple Authentication and Security
   Layer (SASL) and the Generic Security Service Application Program
   Interface (GSS-API) are application frameworks to generalize
   authentication.  This memo specifies a SASL mechanism and GSS-API
   mechanism for SAML 2.0 that allows the integration of existing SAML
   Identity Providers with applications using SASL and GSS-API.

Internet-Draft          A SASL Mechanism for SAML              July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
   [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] is a modular specification that provides
   various means for a user to be identified to a relying party (RP)
   through the exchange of (typically signed) assertions issued by an
   identity provider (IdP).  It includes a number of protocols, protocol
   bindings [OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os], and interoperability profiles
   [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os] designed for different use cases.

   Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] is a
   generalized mechanism for identifying and authenticating a user and
   for optionally negotiating a security layer for subsequent protocol
   interactions.  SASL is used by application protocols like IMAP, POP
   and XMPP.  The effect is to make modular authentication, so that
   newer authentication mechanisms can be added as needed.  This memo
   specifies just such a mechanism.

   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] provides a framework for applications to support multiple
   authentication mechanisms through a unified interface.  This document
   defines a pure SASL mechanism for OpenID, but it conforms to the new
   bridge between SASL and the GSS-API called GS2 [I-D.ietf-sasl-gs2].
   This means that this document defines both a SASL mechanism and a
   GSS-API mechanism.  We want to point out that the GSS-API interface
   is optional for SASL implementers, and the GSS-API considerations can
   be avoided in environments that uses SASL directly without GSS-API.

   As currently envisioned, this mechanism is to allow the interworking
   between SASL and SAML in order to assert identity and other
   attributes to relying parties.  As such, while servers (as relying
   parties) will advertise SASL mechanisms (including SAML), clients
   will select the SAML SASL mechanism as their SASL mechanism of
   choice.

   The SAML mechanism described in this memo aims to re-use the
   available SAML deployment to a maximum extent and therefore does not
   establish a separate authentication, integrity and confidentiality
   mechanism.  It is anticipated that existing security layers, such as
   Transport Layer Security (TLS), will continued to be used.

   Figure 1 describes the interworking between SAML and SASL: this
   document requires enhancements to the Relying Party and to the Client
   (as the two SASL communication end points) but no changes to the SAML
   Identity Provider are necessary.  To accomplish this goal some
   indirect messaging is tunneled within SASL, and some use of external
   methods is made.

3.  Applicability for non-HTTP Use Cases

   While SAML itself is merely a markup language, its common use case
   these days is with HTTP.  What follows is a typical flow:

   1.  The browser requests a resource of a Relying Party (RP) (via an
       HTTP request).

   2.  The RP sends an HTTP redirect as described in Section 10.3 of
       [RFC2616] to the browser to the Identity Provider (IdP) or an IdP
       discovery service with an authentication request that contains
       the name of resource being requested, some sort of a cookie and a
       return URL,

   3.  The user authenticates to the IdP and perhaps authorizes the
       authentication to the service provider.

   4.  In its authentication response, the IdP redirects the browser
       back to the RP with an authentication assertion (stating that the
       IdP vouches that the subject has successfully authenticated),
       optionally along with some additional attributes.

   5.  RP now has sufficient identity information to approve access to
       the resource or not, and acts accordingly.  The authentication is
       concluded.

   When considering this flow in the context of SASL, we note that while
   the RP and the client both must change their code to implement this
   SASL mechanism, the IdP must remain untouched.  The RP already has
   some sort of session (probably a TCP connection) established with the
   client.  However, it may be necessary to redirect a SASL client to
   another application or handler.  This will be discussed below.  The
   steps are shown from below:

   1.  The Relying Party or SASL server advertises support for the SASL
       SAML20 mechanism to the client

   2.  The client initiates a SASL authentication with SAML20 and sends
       an IdP identity

   3.  The Relying Party transmits an authentication request encoded
       using a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) as described in RFC
       3986 [RFC3986] and a redirect to the IdP

   4.  The SASL client now sends an empty response, as authentication
       continues via the normal SAML flow.

Internet-Draft          A SASL Mechanism for SAML              July 2010


   5.  At this point the SASL client MUST construct a URL containing the
       content received in the previous message from the RP.  This URL
       is transmitted to the IdP either by the SASL client application
       or an appropriate handler, such as a browser.

   6.  Next the client authenticates to the IdP.  The manner in which
       the end user is authenticated to the IdP and any policies
       surrounding such authentication is out of scope for SAML and
       hence for this draft.  This step happens out of band from SASL.

   7.  The IdP will convey information about the success or failure of
       the authentication back to the the RP in the form of an
       Authentication Statement or failure, using a indirect response
       via the client browser or the handler.  This step happens out of
       band from SASL.

   8.  The SASL Server sends an appropriate SASL response to the client,
       along with an optional list of attributes

   Please note: What is described here is the case in which the client
   has not previously authenticated.  If the client can handle SAML
   internally it is possible that the client already holds a valid SAML
   authentication token so that the user does not need to be involved in
   the process anymore, but that would still be external to SASL.

   With all of this in mind, the flow appears as follows:

4.  SAML SASL Mechanism Specification

   Based on the previous figure, the following operations are performed
   with the SAML SASL mechanism:

4.1.  Advertisement

   To advertise that a server supports SAML 2.0, during application
   session initiation, it displays the name "SAML20" in the list of
   supported SASL mechanisms.

4.2.  Initiation

   A client initiates a "SAML20" authentication with SASL by sending the
   GS2 header followed by the authentication identifier.  The GS2 header
   carries the optional authorization identity.


        initial-response = gs2-header Idp-Identifier
        IdP-Identifier = Identifier ; IdP identifier
        Identifier = URI            ; IdP URI


   The "gs2-header" is specified in [I-D.ietf-sasl-gs2], and it is used
   as follows.  The "gs2-nonstd-flag" MUST NOT be present.  Regarding
   the channel binding "gs2-cb-flag" field, see Section 5.  The "gs2-
   authzid" carries the optional authorization identity.  URI is
   specified in [RFC3986].

4.3.  Server Redirect

   The SASL Server transmits a redirect to the IdP that the user
   provided, with a SAML authentication request in the form of a SAML
   assertion as one of the parameters.

4.4.  Client Empty Response and other

   The SASL client hands the URI it received from the server in the
   previous step to either a browser or other appropriate handler to
   continue authentication externally while sending an empty response to
   the SASL server.  The URI is encoded according to Section 3.4 of the
   SAML bindings 2.0 specification [OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os].

4.5.  Outcome and parameters

   The SAML authentication having completed externally, the SASL server
   will transmit the outcome

Internet-Draft          A SASL Mechanism for SAML              July 2010


5.  SAML GSS-API Mechanism Specification

   This section and its sub-sections and all normative references of it
   not referenced elsewhere in this document are INFORMATIONAL for SASL
   implementors, but they are NORMATIVE for GSS-API implementors.

   The SAML SASL mechanism is actually also a GSS-API mechanism.  The
   messages are the same, but

   a) the GS2 header on the client's first message and channel binding
   data is excluded when SAML is used as a GSS-API mechanism, and

   b) the RFC2743 section 3.1 initial context token header is prefixed
   to the client's first authentication message (context token).

   The GSS-API mechanism OID for SAML is XXXXX

   SAML security contexts always have the mutual_state flag
   (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) set to TRUE.  SAML does not support credential
   delegation, therefore SCRAM security contexts alway have the
   deleg_state flag (GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG) set to FALSE.

   The SAML mechanism does not support per-message tokens or
   GSS_Pseudo_random.

5.1.  GSS-API Principal Name Types for SAML

   SAML supports standard generic name syntaxes for acceptors such as
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see [RFC2743], Section 4.1).  SAML
   supports only a single name type for initiators: GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME.
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME is the default name type for SAML.  The query,
   display, and exported name syntaxes for SAML principal names are all
   the same.  There are no SAML-specific name syntaxes -- applications
   should use generic GSS-API name types such as GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME and
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see [RFC2743], Section 4).  The exported
   name token does, of course, conform to [RFC2743], Section 3.2.  GSS-
   API name attributes may be defined in the future to hold the SAML
   Subject Identifier.

6.  Channel Binding

   The "gs2-cb-flag" MUST use "n" because channel binding data cannot be
   integrity protected by the SAML negotiation.

7.  Example

   Suppose the user has an identity at the SAML IdP saml.example.org and
   a Jabber Identifier (JID) "somenode@example.com", and wishes to
   authenticate his XMPP connection to xmpp.example.com.  The
   authentication on the wire would then look something like the
   following:

   Step 1: Client initiates stream to server:


   <stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client'
   xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'
   to='example.com' version='1.0'>


   Step 2: Server responds with a stream tag sent to client:


   <stream:stream
   xmlns='jabber:client' xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'
   id='some_id' from='example.com' version='1.0'>


   Step 3: Server informs client of available authentication mechanisms:


   <stream:features>
    <mechanisms xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'>
     <mechanism>DIGEST-MD5</mechanism>
     <mechanism>PLAIN</mechanism>
     <mechanism>SAML20</mechanism>
    </mechanisms>
   </stream:features>


   Step 4: Client selects an authentication mechanism:


   <auth xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl' mechanism='SAML20'>
    https://saml.example.org</auth>


   Step 5: Server sends a BASE64 [RFC4648] encoded challenge to client
   in the form of an HTTP Redirect to the SAML IdP with the SAML
   Authentication Request as specified in the redirection url:

   Step 5 (alt): Server returns error to client:


   <failure xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'>
    <incorrect-encoding/>
   </failure>
   </stream:stream>


   Step 6: Client sends a BASE64 encoded empty response to the
   challenge:


   <response xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'>
    =
   </response>


   [ The client now sends the URL to a browser for processing.  The
   browser engages in a normal SAML authentication flow (external to
   SASL), like redirection to the Identity Provider
   (https://saml.example.org), the user logs into
   https://saml.example.org, and agrees to authenticate to
   xmpp.example.com.  A redirect is passed back to the client browser
   who sends the AuthN response to the server, containing the subject-
   identifier as an attribute.  If the AuthN response doesn't contain
   the JID, the server maps the subject-identifier received from the IdP
   to a JID]

   Step 7: Server informs client of successful authentication:


   <success xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'/>


   Step 7 (alt): Server informs client of failed authentication:


   <failure xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'>
    <temporary-auth-failure/>
   </failure>
   </stream:stream>

   Step 8: Client initiates a new stream to server:


   <stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client'
   xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'
   to='example.com' version='1.0'>


   Step 9: Server responds by sending a stream header to client along
   with any additional features (or an empty features element):


   <stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client'
   xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'
   id='c2s_345' from='example.com' version='1.0'>
   <stream:features>
    <bind xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind'/>
    <session xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-session'/>
   </stream:features>


   Step 10: Client binds a resource:


      <iq type='set' id='bind_1'>
        <bind xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind'>
          <resource>someresource</resource>
        </bind>
      </iq>


   Step 11: Server informs client of successful resource binding:


      <iq type='result' id='bind_1'>
        <bind xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind'>
          <jid>somenode@example.com/someresource</jid>
        </bind>
      </iq>


   Please note: line breaks were added to the base64 for clarity.

8.  Security Considerations

   This section will address only security considerations associated
   with the use of SAML with SASL applications.  For considerations
   relating to SAML in general, the reader is referred to the SAML
   specification and to other literature.  Similarly, for general SASL
   Security Considerations, the reader is referred to that
   specification.

8.1.  Binding SAML subject identifiers to Authorization Identities

   As specified in [RFC4422], the server is responsible for binding
   credentials to a specific authorization identity.  It is therefore
   necessary that only specific trusted IdPs be allowed.  This is
   typical part of SAML trust establishment between RP's and IdP.

8.2.  User Privacy

   The IdP is aware of each RP that a user logs into.  There is nothing
   in the protocol to hide this information from the IdP.  It is not a
   requirement to track the visits, but there is nothing that prohibits
   the collection of information.  SASL servers should be aware that
   SAML IdPs will track - to some extent - user access to their
   services.

8.3.  Collusion between RPs

   It is possible for RPs to link data that they have collected on you.
   By using the same identifier to log into every RP, collusion between
   RPs is possible.  In SAML, targeted identity was introduced.
   Targeted identity allows the IdP to transform the identifier the user
   typed in to an opaque identifier.  This way the RP would never see
   the actual user identifier, but a randomly generated identifier.
   This is an option the user has to understand and decide to use if the
   IdP is supporting it.

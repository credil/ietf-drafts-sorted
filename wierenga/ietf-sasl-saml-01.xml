  <t>
   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) has found its
   usage on the Internet for Web Single Sign-On. Simple Authentication
and
   Security Layer (SASL) and the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   are application frameworks to generalize authentication. This memo specifies a SASL mechanism 
   and GSS-API mechanism for SAML 2.0 that
   allows the integration of existing SAML Identity Providers with
   applications using SASL and GSS-API.

<section title="Introduction"> 
<t> 
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os"/> is a modular specification that provides
   various means for a user to be identified to a relying party (RP)
   through the exchange of (typically signed) assertions issued by an
   identity provider (IdP).  It includes a number of protocols, protocol
   bindings <xref target="OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os"/>, and interoperability profiles
   <xref target="OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os"/> designed for different use cases.
</t> 
<t> 
Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) <xref target="RFC4422"/> is a generalized 
mechanism for identifying and authenticating a user and for optionally negotiating a security layer 
for subsequent protocol interactions. SASL is used by application protocols like IMAP, POP and
XMPP. The effect is to make modular authentication, so that newer
authentication mechanisms can be added as needed. This memo specifies
just such a mechanism. 
</t> 
<t>The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) <xref target="RFC2743"/>
provides a framework for applications to support multiple
   authentication mechanisms through a unified interface.  This document
   defines a pure SASL mechanism for OpenID, but it conforms to the new
   bridge between SASL and the GSS-API called GS2 <xref target="I-D.ietf-sasl-gs2"/>.
   This means that this document defines both a SASL mechanism and a
   GSS-API mechanism.  We want to point out that the GSS-API interface
   is optional for SASL implementers, and the GSS-API considerations can
   be avoided in environments that uses SASL directly without GSS-API.

</t>
<t> As currently envisioned, this mechanism
is to allow the interworking between SASL and SAML in order to assert
identity and other attributes to relying parties. As such, while servers
(as relying parties) will advertise SASL mechanisms (including SAML),
clients will select
the SAML SASL mechanism as their SASL mechanism of choice. </t> 

<t>The SAML mechanism described in this memo
aims to re-use the available SAML deployment to a maximum extent and
therefore does not establish a separate authentication, integrity and
confidentiality mechanism. It is anticipated that existing security
layers, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), will continued to be
used.</t>

<t><xref target="overview"/> describes the interworking between SAML and
SASL: this document requires enhancements to the Relying Party and to
the Client (as the two SASL communication end points) but no changes to
the SAML Identity Provider are necessary. To accomplish this goal some
indirect messaging is tunneled within SASL, and some use of external
methods is made.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology"> 
<t>The key words
"MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
<t>The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms used in the SAML
2.0 specification.</t> 
</section>

<section title="Applicability for non-HTTP Use Cases"> 
<t>While SAML
itself is merely a markup language, its common use case these days is
with HTTP.  What follows is a typical flow: </t> 
<t> 
<list style="numbers"> 
<t>The browser requests a resource of a Relying Party (RP) (via an HTTP request).</t> 
<t>The RP sends an HTTP 
redirect as described in Section 10.3 of <xref target="RFC2616" />  to
the browser to the Identity Provider (IdP) or an IdP discovery service with
an authentication request that contains the name of resource being
requested, some sort of a cookie and a return URL, </t>
<t> The user
authenticates to the IdP and perhaps authorizes the authentication to
the service provider. </t>
<t> In its authentication response, the IdP
redirects the browser back to the RP with an
authentication assertion (stating that the IdP vouches that the subject has successfully 
authenticated), optionally along with some additional attributes. </t>
<t> RP now has sufficient identity
information to approve access to the resource or not, and acts
accordingly.  The authentication is concluded. </t> 
</list> </t> 

<t>When
considering this flow in the context of SASL, we note that while the
RP and the client both must change
their code to implement this SASL mechanism, the IdP must remain
untouched.  The  RP already has some sort of session 
(probably a TCP connection) established with the client. However, it may be
necessary to redirect a SASL client to another application or
handler.  This will be discussed below.

The steps are shown from below:</t> 
<t> 
<list style="numbers"> 
 <t> The Relying Party or SASL server advertises support for the SASL 
 SAML20 mechanism to the client </t> 
 <t> The client initiates a SASL authentication with SAML20 and sends an IdP identity</t> 
 <t>The Relying Party transmits an authentication request encoded using a Universal Resource 
 Identifier (URI) as described in RFC 3986 <xref target="RFC3986"/> and a redirect to the IdP</t>
 <t> The SASL client now sends an empty response, as authentication continues via the normal SAML 
 flow. </t>
 <t> At this point the SASL client MUST construct a URL containing the content received in the
 previous message from the RP. This URL is transmitted to the IdP either by the SASL client 
 application or an appropriate handler, such as a browser.</t> 
 <t>Next the client authenticates to the IdP. The manner in which the end user is authenticated to 
 the IdP and any policies surrounding such authentication is out of scope for SAML and hence for 
 this draft. This step happens out of band from SASL.</t>
 <t>The IdP will convey information about the success or failure of the authentication back to the
 the RP in the form of an Authentication Statement or failure, using a indirect response via the 
 client browser or the handler. This step happens out of band from SASL.</t>
 <t> The SASL Server sends an appropriate SASL response to the client, along with an
optional list of attributes</t> 
</list> </t> 
<t>Please note: What is described here is the case in which the client has not previously 
authenticated. If the client can handle SAML internally it is possible that the client 
already holds a valid SAML authentication token so that the user does not need to be involved in 
the process anymore, but that would still be external to SASL. 
</t>

<t> With all of this in mind, the flow appears as follows: </t>

<section title="SAML SASL Mechanism Specification"> 
 <t>
  Based on the
  previous figure, the following operations are performed with the SAML
  SASL mechanism: 
 </t>

 <section title="Advertisement" anchor="advertisement"> 
  <t> 
   To advertise
   that a server supports SAML 2.0, during application session initiation,
   it displays the name &quot;SAML20&quot; in the list of supported SASL
   mechanisms. 
  </t> 
 </section> 

 <section title="Initiation" anchor="initiation"> 
  <t>
   A client initiates a &quot;SAML20&quot; authentication with SASL by sending the
   GS2 header followed by the authentication identifier.  The GS2 header carries the optional authorization
   identity.
  </t>

    ]]>
   </artwork>
  </figure>
 <t>
  The "gs2-header" is specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sasl-gs2"/>, and it is used
  as follows.  The "gs2-nonstd-flag" MUST NOT be present.  Regarding
  the channel binding "gs2-cb-flag" field, see Section 5.  The "gs2-
  authzid" carries the optional authorization identity.

  URI is specified in <xref target="RFC3986"/>.  
 </t>
</section> 

 <section title="Server Redirect" anchor="1stresponse"> 
  <t> 
   The SASL Server transmits a redirect to the IdP that the user provided, 
   with a SAML authentication request 
   in the form of a SAML assertion as one of the parameters.</t>
 </section> 

 <section title="Client Empty Response and other" anchor="empty"> 
  <t>
   The SASL client hands
   the URI it received from the server in the previous step to either a
   browser or other appropriate handler to continue authentication
   externally while sending an empty response to the SASL server.  
   The URI is encoded according to
   Section 3.4 of the <xref target="OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os">SAML
   bindings 2.0 specification</xref>. 
  </t> 
 </section> 

 <section title="Outcome and parameters" anchor="outcome"> 
  <t>
   The SAML authentication having completed externally, the SASL server will
   transmit the outcome
  </t> 
 </section>

</section>

<section title="SAML GSS-API Mechanism Specification" anchor="gss-api">
 <t>
   This section and its sub-sections and all normative references of it
   not referenced elsewhere in this document are INFORMATIONAL for SASL
   implementors, but they are NORMATIVE for GSS-API implementors.
</t>
<t>
   The SAML SASL mechanism is actually also a GSS-API mechanism.  The
   messages are the same, but 
 </t>
<t>  
   a) the GS2 header on the client's first
   message and channel binding data is excluded when SAML is used as a
   GSS-API mechanism, and 
 </t>
<t>  
   b) the RFC2743 section 3.1 initial context token header is prefixed to 
   the client's first authentication message (context token).
</t>
<t>
   The GSS-API mechanism OID for SAML is XXXXX
</t>
<t>
   SAML security contexts always have the mutual_state flag
   (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) set to TRUE.  SAML does not support credential
   delegation, therefore SCRAM security contexts alway have the
   deleg_state flag (GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG) set to FALSE.
</t>
<t>
   The SAML mechanism does not support per-message tokens or
   GSS_Pseudo_random.
 </t>
<section title="GSS-API Principal Name Types for SAML" anchor="gss-api-name-types">
 <t>
     SAML supports standard generic name syntaxes for acceptors such as
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see <xref target="RFC2743"/>, Section 4.1).

   SAML supports only a single name type for initiators:
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME.  GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME is the default name type for
   SAML.

   The query, display, and exported name syntaxes for SAML principal
   names are all the same.  There are no SAML-specific name syntaxes
   -- applications should use generic GSS-API name types such as
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME and GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see <xref target="RFC2743"/>,
   Section 4).  The exported name token does, of course, conform to
   <xref target="RFC2743"/>, Section 3.2.

   GSS-API name attributes may be defined in the future to hold the
   SAML Subject Identifier.

 </t>
</section>

</section>
<section title="Channel Binding" anchor="channel-binding">
 <t>
   The "gs2-cb-flag" MUST use "n" because channel binding data cannot be
   integrity protected by the SAML negotiation.
 </t>
</section>

<section title="Example" anchor="example"> 

<t> Suppose the user has an identity at the SAML IdP saml.example.org and a Jabber Identifier (JID) 
"somenode@example.com", and wishes to authenticate his XMPP connection to xmpp.example.com. The 
authentication on the wire would then look something like the following: </t>

<t>Step 1: Client initiates stream to server: </t>

<![CDATA[
<failure xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'> 
 <incorrect-encoding/>
</failure>

<t>Step 6: Client sends a BASE64 encoded empty response to the
challenge:</t>

<t>
[ The client now sends the URL to a browser for processing. The browser
engages in a normal SAML authentication flow (external to SASL),
like redirection to the Identity Provider (https://saml.example.org), the
user logs into https://saml.example.org, and agrees to authenticate to
xmpp.example.com.  A redirect is passed back to the client browser who
sends the AuthN response to the server, containing the subject-identifier as 
an attribute. If the AuthN response doesn't contain the JID, the server maps 
the subject-identifier received from the IdP to a JID]

<t>Step 7: Server informs client of successful authentication: </t>

<section title="Security Considerations"> 
<t>
 This section will address only security considerations associated
   with the use of SAML with SASL applications.  For considerations
   relating to SAML in general, the reader is referred to the SAML
   specification and to other literature.  Similarly, for general SASL
   Security Considerations, the reader is referred to that
   specification.
</t>
<section title="Binding SAML subject identifiers to Authorization Identities">
<t>
   As specified in <xref target="RFC4422"/>, the server is responsible for binding
   credentials to a specific authorization identity.  It is therefore
   necessary that only specific trusted IdPs be 
   allowed. This is typical part of SAML trust establishment between RP's and IdP.  
</t>
</section>
<section title="User Privacy">
<t>
   The IdP is aware of each RP that a user logs into.  There is nothing
   in the protocol to hide this information from the IdP.  It is not a
   requirement to track the visits, but there is nothing that prohibits
   the collection of information.  SASL servers should be aware that
   SAML IdPs will track - to some extent - user access to
   their services.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Collusion between RPs">
<t>
   It is possible for RPs to link data that they have collected on you.
   By using the same identifier to log into every RP, collusion between
   RPs is possible.  In SAML, targeted identity was introduced.
   Targeted identity allows the IdP to transform the identifier the user
   typed in to an opaque identifier.  This way the RP would never see the
   actual user identifier, but a randomly generated identifier.  This is
   an option the user has to understand and decide to use if the IdP is
   supporting it.

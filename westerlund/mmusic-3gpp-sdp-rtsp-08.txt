2.  Introduction

   3GPP has specified the Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) that
   uses both RTSP [RFC2326] and SDP [RFC4566].  The service is specified
   in technical specifications TS 26.233 [PSS-233] and TS 26.234
   [PSS-234] in Release 4 and subsequent releases.  The basic service
   defined in Release 4 is enhanced in Release 5 with capability
   exchange and in Release 6 with a number of features, such as
   adaptation, digital rights management, progressive download as well
   as a streaming server file-format defined in [PSS-3GP].  Fast

Internet-Draft       SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP             Sep 2010


   start-up and content switching are addressed in Release 7.

   3GPP has also specified the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service
   (MBMS) that uses SDP.  The IP layer protocols used by this service
   are specified in technical specification TS 26.346 Release 6 [MBMS].
   Release 7 extends the MBMS User Service to also work with unicast
   bearers for interactive and streaming traffic classes.

   In the process of defining these services, there has occasionally
   been a need to extend both SDP and RTSP functionalities.  These
   extensions have mostly been in the form of SDP attributes and RTSP
   headers and option tags. 3GPP uses the name feature tags (like RTSP
   2.0 for what RTSP 1.0 calls option tags), option tag is the name that
   will be used in this document.  The purpose of this informational
   document is to register these SDP and RTSP extensions, in order to
   avoid future conflicts, and also to raise the awareness of their
   existence within IETF.

   This document defines in Section 5.4 three SDP protocol identifiers
   used in MBMS to enable the usage of block-based FEC.  The SDP
   protocol identifiers require an IETF RFC to be defined and
   registered.  Thus any semantic change will require a new IETF
   approved RFC.  The other SDP and RTSP extensions registered by this
   document are not normatively defined in this document.  Instead the
   normative definitions are referenced by the registrations. 3GPP can
   update the normative definition in future version of their
   specifications.  However to ensure that such a change is visible in
   IETF at minimal IANA should be notified and the reference to the 3GPP
   specification updated and preferably an updated version of this RFC
   published.

   The document begins with two chapters presenting the SDP extensions
   for PSS and MBMS, respectively.  Followed by a section noting that
   offer/answer considerations are not applicable here.  The subsequent
   section presents the extensions of RTSP for PSS.  The IANA
   registration of SDP attributes and protocol identifiers is given in
   Section 8.1, and the RTSP headers and option tags in Section 8.2.
   For normative descriptions of all SDP and RTSP extensions we refer to
   TS 26.234 [PSS-234] and TS 26.346 [MBMS].


3.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes 3GPP-defined extensions to SDP [RFC4566] and
   RTSP [RFC2326] and registers attributes that are normatively defined
   in 3GPP technical specifications 26.234, 26.244 and 26.346 up to the
   referenced versions of the respective documents.

Internet-Draft       SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP             Sep 2010


   The SDP and RTSP extensions have only been defined for usage with the
   3GPP service in mind.  The applicability for usage outside of these
   services has not been considered nor addressed.  Usage of these
   attributes in other contexts may require further definitions or
   clarifications.  For example, all SDP attributes lack offer/answer
   usage rules [RFC3264] which currently makes it impossible to use them
   with offer/answer.  Please note that change control of these SDP and
   RTSP extensions belongs to 3GPP.


4.  PSS SDP Extensions

   The PSS specification [PSS-234] defines a number of different SDP
   attributes for different purposes.  They are listed below grouped by
   their purpose.  The text is intentionally not specific enough to
   allow implementation from this document.  The normative definition is
   in the 3GPP technical specification cited.

4.1.  Video Buffering Attributes

   The following attributes are used to provide parameters for the video
   buffer model provided in Annex G and Section 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-234].
   The attributes were defined in Release 5 as "X-" attributes and were
   at the time not considered for registration.  In hindsight, however,
   they should not have been "X-" attributes, and they should have been
   registered, as the registration rules of SDP [RFC4566] point out.
   Changing their names today is impossible due to the deployed base of
   millions of mobile handsets supporting PSS, and therefore they are
   registered in their current form.

   All attributes are defined at media level.

   o  The "a=X-predecbufsize" attribute provides the size of the pre-
      decoder buffer in bytes.

   o  The "a=X-initpredecbufperiod" attribute provides the time during
      which a receiver should initially buffer, in 90kHz ticks, before
      starting to consume the data in the buffer in order to ensure that
      underflow does not occur, assuming correct data delivery.

   o  The "a=X-initpostdecbufperiod" attribute provides the initial
      buffering period, in 90kHz ticks, for the post-decoder buffer
      present in H.263 and MPEG-4 Visual.

   o  The "a=X-decbyterate" attribute indicates the maximum peak byte-
      decoding rate used in the verification of the Annex G buffer model
      expressed in bytes per second.

Internet-Draft       SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP             Sep 2010


   o  The "a=3gpp-videopostdecbufsize" attribute is used to indicate the
      value used in determining the H.264 video post-decoder buffer
      size.

   Note that complete descriptions of these attributes can be found in
   section 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-234].

4.2.  Video Frame Size Attribute

   This media-level attribute provides the receiver with the largest
   picture size a specific H.263 payload type will carry within the
   session.  The attribute has the following form (see 5.3.3.2 of
   [PSS-234]):

   "a=framesize:<payload type number> <width>-<height>"

4.3.  Integrity Protection Configuration Attributes

   These attributes are all used to configure the integrity-protection
   mechanism defined in Annex K (section K.2.2.1, K.2.2.2 and K.2.2.3)
   of [PSS-234].

   o  The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-Integrity-Key" carries the
      integrity key used to derive SRTP master keys for integrity
      protection.  The key is protected in different ways depending on a
      method identifier.  When using OMA DRM key management, the key is
      encrypted using AES [AES] before it is base64 encoded [RFC4648].

   o  The media-level attribute "a=3GPP-SRTP-Config" is used to
      configure SRTP for integrity protection and contains an integrity
      nonce, a key salt used in deriving the SRTP master key from the
      integrity key, and any SRTP configuration parameters, such as the
      integrity tag length.

   o  The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-SDP-Auth" is used to carry an
      authentication tag calculated over certain parts of the SDP to
      prevent manipulation of the security attributes.

4.4.  The Alternative Attributes

   Two media and one session-level attributes are used in a mechanism
   for providing alternative SDP lines.  One or more SDP lines at media
   level can be replaced, if desired, by alternatives.  The mechanism is
   backwards compatible in the way that a receiver that does not support
   the attributes will get the default configuration.  The different
   alternatives can be grouped using different attributes that can be
   specified hierarchically with a top and a lower level. 3GPP Release 6
   supports grouping based on bit-rate, according to the SDP bandwidth

Internet-Draft       SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP             Sep 2010


   modifiers AS and TIAS, and language.

   The SDP attributes (see 5.3.3.3 and 5.3.3.4 of [PSS-234]) are:

   o  The media-level attribute "a=alt:<id>:<SDP-Line>" carries any SDP
      line and an alternative identifier.

   o  The media-level attribute "a=alt-default-id:<id>" identifies the
      default configuration to be used in groupings.

   o  The session-level attribute "a=alt-group" is used to group
      different recommended media alternatives.  Providing aggregated
      properties for the whole group according to the grouping type.
      Language and bit-rate are two defined grouping types.

4.5.  Adaptation Attribute

   The media-level SDP attribute "a=3GPP-Adaptation-Support" (see
   5.3.3.5 in [PSS-234]) is defined as part of the negotiation procedure
   of the PSS adaptation mechanism.  The attribute carries a single
   value indicating how often the RTCP "Next Application Data Unit"
   (NADU) APP packet shall be included in sent RTCP compound packets.
   The adaptation mechanism allows the client to provide the server with
   information on the available transmission bit-rate and receiver
   buffer status.

4.6.  Quality of Experience Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-QoE-Metrics" (see
   5.3.3.6 of [PSS-234]]) is used to negotiate the usage of the quality
   of experience metrics.  The included parameters indicate which
   metrics, over which duration there should be measurements, and how
   often reports should be sent.

4.7.  Asset Information Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-Asset-Information" (see
   5.3.3.7 of [PSS-234]) can exist in multiple instances in a
   description and describes different types of asset information.  The
   different asset classes defined in Release 6 are: Title, Description,
   Copyright, Performer, Author, Genre, Rating, Classification,
   Keywords, Location, Album, and Recording Year.  The different assets
   are described with a BASE64-encoded asset box from the 3GP file
   format [PSS-3GP].

5.  MBMS SDP Extensions

   The MBMS specification [MBMS] defines a number of different SDP
   attributes for different purposes.  They are informatively listed
   below.

5.1.  MBMS Bearer Mode Declaration Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=mbms-mode" (see 7.3.2.7 of
   [MBMS]) is used to describe MBMS broadcast mode media.  The attribute
   may be used at session level to set the default for all media and at
   media level to specify differences between media.  However, the
   attribute is never used at session level when the session includes
   MBMS multicast mode media, nor at media level to describe MBMS
   multicast mode media.

5.2.  FEC Flow ID Attribute

   The media-level attribute "a=mbms-flowid" (see 8.3.1.9 of [MBMS])
   maps one or more FEC source block flow IDs to their corresponding
   destination IP addresses and UDP port numbers.  It is present in each
   SDP media block for repair packet streams.

5.3.  MBMS Repair Attribute

   The session and media-level attribute "a=mbms-repair" (see 8.3.1.8 of
   [MBMS]) is used to provide FEC repair packets with non-FEC specific
   parameters.  FFor release 6, one such parameter is defined to specify
   the required minimum receiver buffer time.

5.4.  SDP Protocol Identifiers for FEC

   MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-based FEC for UDP-based
   traffic.  This solution uses the SDP protocol "proto" identifier to
   identify the media streams that use the FEC shim layer.  The media
   streams may be either source streams or repair streams.  As required
   by SDP [RFC4566], these protocol identifiers are normatively defined
   in this document in accordance with their usage specified by 3GPP.

5.4.1.  RTP Protocol Identifiers

   For FEC-protected RTP streams, the following two "proto" identifiers
   are defined:

   o  UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/AVP

   o  UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/SAVP

Internet-Draft       SDP & RTSP extensions for 3GPP             Sep 2010


   They indicate the usage of UDP [RFC0768] with MBMS FEC Source packet
   formats, as defined in Section 8.2.2.4 of [MBMS], that transport RTP
   packets in accordance with the AVP [RFC3551] or SAVP (Secure RTP)
   [RFC3711] profiles, respectively.  These protocol identifiers SHALL
   use the FMT space rules that are used for RTP/AVP and RTP/SAVP,
   respectively.

5.4.2.  FEC Repair Data Identifier

   A media stream carrying MBMS FEC repair information over UDP requires
   its own "proto" identifier.  Protocol identifier "UDP/MBMS-REPAIR"
   identifies the FEC repair packet containing the protocol combination
   of UDP [RFC0768] and FEC repair payload ID and repair symbols as
   specified in Section 8.2.2.5 of [MBMS].  The FMT string is not used
   and SHALL be set to "*".

5.5.  Video Buffering Attribute

   The PSS media-level buffer attribute "a=X-initpredecbufperiod"(See
   Section 4.1) that specifies an initial buffering time is also used
   for MBMS in Release 7.  It is mainly intended for video streams, but
   may be used for other media types as well (See Section 8.3.1.1 of
   [MBMS]).


6.  SDP Offer/Answer Consideration

   The usage of the SDP attributes in an Offer/Answer [RFC3264] context
   is not defined.  These SDP attributes are defined for being used in a
   declarative context, and for PSS specifically in RTSP [RFC2326]
   context.


7.  PSS RTSP Extensions

   The RTSP extensions for PSS consist of a number of new RTSP headers
   and option tags and a narrowing of URI usage in regards to 3GP files.
   The headers and option tags are informatively described here; see
   [PSS-234] for the normative declaration.

7.1.  3GPP-Link-Char Header

   The "3GPP-Link-Char" header (see 5.3.2.1 of [PSS-234]) is used by
   clients to provide the server with QoS information about the wireless
   link it is currently using.  The header can be used to provide the
   server with three different QoS parameters:

   o  Guaranteed Bandwidth

   o  Maximum Bandwidth

   o  Maximum Transfer Delay

   The header may be included in RTSP requests using either of the
   methods SETUP, PLAY, OPTIONS and SET_PARAMETER.

7.2.  3GPP-Adaptation Header

   The "3GPP-Adaptation" header (see 5.3.2.2 of [PSS-234]) is used by
   the client to provide the server with adaptation-related parameters
   and to indicate support of the adaptation function.  The header
   carries the resource identification as a URI, the client's buffer
   size, and the desired target time.

   The header may be included in requests using the methods SETUP, PLAY,
   OPTIONS and SET_PARAMETER.  The response to a request using this
   method shall include this header.

7.3.  3GPP-QoE-Metrics Header

   The "3GPP-QoE-Metrics" header (see 5.3.2.3.1 of [PSS-234]) is used to
   negotiate the usage of the quality of experience (QoE) metrics (see
   Section 11 of [PSS-234]).

   The header may be included in requests and responses using the SETUP,
   SET_PARAMTER, OPTIONS or PLAY method.

7.4.  3GPP-QoE-Feedback Header

   The "3GPP-QoE-Feedback" header (see 5.3.2.3.2 of [PSS-234]) is used
   to carry QoE metrics from the client to the server when it reports,
   which happens either during or at the end of the media delivery.

   The header may be included in requests using the SET_PARAMETER,
   PAUSE, or TEARDOWN method.

7.5.  Video Buffer Headers

   PSS uses several headers to provide the client with the different
   buffer parameters.  They provide the buffer status at the point of a
   stream that a PLAY request plays from.  These headers may only be
   used in PLAY responses.  See Section 5.3.2.4 and Annex G of [PSS-234]
   for normative definitions.

   The three "x-" headers were defined in 3GPP Release 5.  When it was

   realized that they should not have been given "x-" names, it was to
   late rename them due to deployment.

   The RTSP headers are:

   o  x-predecbufsize

   o  x-initpredecbufperiod

   o  x-initpostdecbufperiod

   o  3gpp-videopostdecbufsize

7.6.  Integrity Protection

   The integrity-protection mechanism defined in PSS Annex K uses the
   "3GPP-Freshness-Token" (See Section K.2.2.4 of [PSS-234]) RTSP header
   to carry a freshness token in DESCRIBE requests.

7.7.  RTSP URI Extension

   The PSS specification also defines syntax for referencing tracks
   within the "3GP" file format [PSS-3GP].  The 3GP format is based on
   the ISO base media file format and defined in several different
   profiles, including a streaming-server profile, in Release 6.

   This syntax is fully contained within the generic URI syntax defined
   for RTSP URIs.  It is only a syntax restriction that server
   manufacturers follow to allow clients or proxies to understand what
   encodes the track number in the URI.  This is provided for
   information only.

   To identify a track within a 3GP file the last URI segment has to
   contain a structure that is <alpha string>=<track nr> (See 5.3.3.1 of
   [PSS-234]).

7.8.  Fast Start-up and Content Switching

   Release 7 of PSS defines a number of extensions in terms of headers
   and option tags (See Section 5.5 of [PSS-234]) for support of fast
   start-up and switching of content for on-demand and live applications
   built on top of PSS.  Clients are enabled to reuse the existing RTSP
   control session and RTP resources while switching to new content.

   The RTSP headers are:

   o  Switch-Stream

   The RTSP option tags are:

   o  3gpp-pipelined

   o  3gpp-switch-req-sdp

   o  3gpp-switch-stream

  SDP Protocol Identifiers ("proto"):

     Name:               UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/AVP
     Long form:          3GPP MBMS FEC protected RTP/AVP over UDP
     Type of name:       proto
     Purpose:            3GPP MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-
                         based FEC for UDP-based traffic.  This solution
                         uses the SDP protocol "proto" identifier to
                         identify the media streams that use the FEC
                         shim layer. This protocol identifier indicates
                         that the FEC protected data is RTP using the
                         AVP profile.

9.  Security Considerations

   SDP attributes are subject to modification by an attacker unless they
   are integrity protected and authenticated.  The security
   consideration of the SDP specification [RFC4566] should be reviewed
   in this regard.  The registered SDP attributes are vulnerable to

   modification attacks or removal, which may result in problems of
   serious nature, including failure to use service and reduced quality.

   The registered RTSP headers are also vunerable to insertion, deletion
   or modification attacks similar to SDP attributes.  Also in this
   case, it can result in failure of the service or reduced quality of
   streaming content.

   The three SDP protocol identifiers do not by themselves introduce any
   additional security threats that don't exist for other protocol
   identifiers in SDP.  The media stream and the used protocols
   identified and configured by the SDP protocol identifier may however
   contain security issues by themselves.

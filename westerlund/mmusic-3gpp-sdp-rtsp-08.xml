    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>3GPP has specified the Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) that
      uses both <xref target="RFC2326">RTSP</xref> and <xref
      target="RFC4566">SDP</xref>. The service is specified in technical
      specifications <xref target="PSS-233">TS 26.233</xref> and <xref
      target="PSS-234">TS 26.234</xref> in Release 4 and subsequent releases.
      The basic service defined in Release 4 is enhanced in Release 5 with
      capability exchange and in Release 6 with a number of features, such as
      adaptation, digital rights management, progressive download as well as a
      streaming server file-format defined in <xref target="PSS-3GP"></xref>.
      Fast start-up and content switching are addressed in Release 7.</t>

      <t>3GPP has also specified the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service
      (MBMS) that uses SDP. The IP layer protocols used by this service are
      specified in technical specification TS 26.346 Release 6 <xref
      target="MBMS"></xref>. Release 7 extends the MBMS User Service to also
      work with unicast bearers for interactive and streaming traffic
      classes.</t>

      <t>In the process of defining these services, there has occasionally
      been a need to extend both SDP and RTSP functionalities. These
      extensions have mostly been in the form of SDP attributes and RTSP
      headers and option tags. 3GPP uses the name feature tags (like RTSP 2.0
      for what RTSP 1.0 calls option tags), option tag is the name that will
      be used in this document. The purpose of this informational document is
      to register these SDP and RTSP extensions, in order to avoid future
      conflicts, and also to raise the awareness of their existence within
      IETF.</t>

      <t>This document defines in <xref target="sec-sdp-proto"></xref> three
      SDP protocol identifiers used in MBMS to enable the usage of block-based
      FEC. The SDP protocol identifiers require an IETF RFC to be defined and
      registered. Thus any semantic change will require a new IETF approved
      RFC. The other SDP and RTSP extensions registered by this document are
      not normatively defined in this document. Instead the normative
      definitions are referenced by the registrations. 3GPP can update the
      normative definition in future version of their specifications. However
      to ensure that such a change is visible in IETF at minimal IANA should
      be notified and the reference to the 3GPP specification updated and
      preferably an updated version of this RFC published.</t>

      <t>The document begins with two chapters presenting the SDP extensions
      for PSS and MBMS, respectively. Followed by a section noting that
      offer/answer considerations are not applicable here. The subsequent
      section presents the extensions of RTSP for PSS. The IANA registration
      of SDP attributes and protocol identifiers is given in <xref
      target="sec-iana-sdp"></xref>, and the RTSP headers and option tags in
      <xref target="sec-iana-rtsp"></xref>. For normative descriptions of all
      SDP and RTSP extensions we refer to <xref target="PSS-234">TS
      26.234</xref> and <xref target="MBMS">TS 26.346</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability Statement">
      <t>This document describes 3GPP-defined extensions to <xref
      target="RFC4566">SDP</xref> and <xref target="RFC2326">RTSP</xref> and
      registers attributes that are normatively defined in 3GPP technical
      specifications 26.234, 26.244 and 26.346 up to the referenced versions
      of the respective documents.</t>

      <t>The SDP and RTSP extensions have only been defined for usage with the
      3GPP service in mind. The applicability for usage outside of these
      services has not been considered nor addressed. Usage of these
      attributes in other contexts may require further definitions or
      clarifications. For example, all SDP attributes lack offer/answer usage
      rules <xref target="RFC3264"></xref> which currently makes it impossible
      to use them with offer/answer. Please note that change control of these
      SDP and RTSP extensions belongs to 3GPP.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PSS SDP Extensions">
      <t>The PSS specification <xref target="PSS-234"></xref> defines a number
      of different SDP attributes for different purposes. They are listed
      below grouped by their purpose. The text is intentionally not specific
      enough to allow implementation from this document. The normative
      definition is in the 3GPP technical specification cited.</t>

      <section title="Video Buffering Attributes">
        <t>The following attributes are used to provide parameters for the
        video buffer model provided in Annex G and Section 5.3.3.2 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>. The attributes were defined in Release 5 as
        "X-" attributes and were at the time not considered for registration.
        In hindsight, however, they should not have been "X-" attributes, and
        they should have been registered, as the registration rules of SDP
        <xref target="RFC4566"></xref> point out. Changing their names today
        is impossible due to the deployed base of millions of mobile handsets
        supporting PSS, and therefore they are registered in their current
        form.</t>

        <t>All attributes are defined at media level.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The "a=X-predecbufsize" attribute provides the size of the
            pre-decoder buffer in bytes.</t>

            <t>The "a=X-initpredecbufperiod" attribute provides the time
            during which a receiver should initially buffer, in 90kHz ticks,
            before starting to consume the data in the buffer in order to
            ensure that underflow does not occur, assuming correct data
            delivery.</t>

            <t>The "a=X-initpostdecbufperiod" attribute provides the initial
            buffering period, in 90kHz ticks, for the post-decoder buffer
            present in H.263 and MPEG-4 Visual.</t>

            <t>The "a=X-decbyterate" attribute indicates the maximum peak
            byte-decoding rate used in the verification of the Annex G buffer
            model expressed in bytes per second.</t>

            <t>The "a=3gpp-videopostdecbufsize" attribute is used to indicate
            the value used in determining the H.264 video post-decoder buffer
            size.</t>
          </list>Note that complete descriptions of these attributes can be
        found in section 5.3.3.2 of <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Video Frame Size Attribute">
        <t>This media-level attribute provides the receiver with the largest
        picture size a specific H.263 payload type will carry within the
        session. The attribute has the following form (see 5.3.3.2 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>):</t>

        <t>"a=framesize:&lt;payload type number&gt;
        &lt;width&gt;-&lt;height&gt;"</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Integrity Protection Configuration Attributes">
        <t>These attributes are all used to configure the integrity-protection
        mechanism defined in Annex K (section K.2.2.1, K.2.2.2 and K.2.2.3) of
        <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-Integrity-Key" carries the
            integrity key used to derive SRTP master keys for integrity
            protection. The key is protected in different ways depending on a
            method identifier. When using OMA DRM key management, the key is
            encrypted using AES [AES] before it is base64 encoded <xref
            target="RFC4648"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The media-level attribute "a=3GPP-SRTP-Config" is used to
            configure SRTP for integrity protection and contains an integrity
            nonce, a key salt used in deriving the SRTP master key from the
            integrity key, and any SRTP configuration parameters, such as the
            integrity tag length.</t>

            <t>The session-level attribute "a=3GPP-SDP-Auth" is used to carry
            an authentication tag calculated over certain parts of the SDP to
            prevent manipulation of the security attributes.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="The Alternative Attributes">
        <t>Two media and one session-level attributes are used in a mechanism
        for providing alternative SDP lines. One or more SDP lines at media
        level can be replaced, if desired, by alternatives. The mechanism is
        backwards compatible in the way that a receiver that does not support
        the attributes will get the default configuration. The different
        alternatives can be grouped using different attributes that can be
        specified hierarchically with a top and a lower level. 3GPP Release 6
        supports grouping based on bit-rate, according to the SDP bandwidth
        modifiers AS and TIAS, and language.</t>

        <t>The SDP attributes (see 5.3.3.3 and 5.3.3.4 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) are: <list style="symbols">
            <t>The media-level attribute "a=alt:&lt;id&gt;:&lt;SDP-Line&gt;"
            carries any SDP line and an alternative identifier.</t>

            <t>The media-level attribute "a=alt-default-id:&lt;id&gt;"
            identifies the default configuration to be used in groupings.</t>

            <t>The session-level attribute "a=alt-group" is used to group
            different recommended media alternatives. Providing aggregated
            properties for the whole group according to the grouping type.
            Language and bit-rate are two defined grouping types.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Adaptation Attribute">
        <t>The media-level SDP attribute "a=3GPP-Adaptation-Support" (see
        5.3.3.5 in <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>) is defined as part of the
        negotiation procedure of the PSS adaptation mechanism. The attribute
        carries a single value indicating how often the RTCP "Next Application
        Data Unit" (NADU) APP packet shall be included in sent RTCP compound
        packets. The adaptation mechanism allows the client to provide the
        server with information on the available transmission bit-rate and
        receiver buffer status.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Quality of Experience Attribute">
        <t>The session and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-QoE-Metrics" (see
        5.3.3.6 of <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>]) is used to negotiate the
        usage of the quality of experience metrics. The included parameters
        indicate which metrics, over which duration there should be
        measurements, and how often reports should be sent.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Asset Information Attribute">
        <t>The session and media-level attribute "a=3GPP-Asset-Information"
        (see 5.3.3.7 of <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>) can exist in multiple
        instances in a description and describes different types of asset
        information. The different asset classes defined in Release 6 are:
        Title, Description, Copyright, Performer, Author, Genre, Rating,
        Classification, Keywords, Location, Album, and Recording Year. The
        different assets are described with a BASE64-encoded asset box from
        the 3GP file format <xref target="PSS-3GP"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="MBMS SDP Extensions">
      <t>The MBMS specification [MBMS] defines a number of different SDP
      attributes for different purposes. They are informatively listed
      below.</t>

      <section title="MBMS Bearer Mode Declaration Attribute">
        <t>The session and media-level attribute "a=mbms-mode" (see 7.3.2.7 of
        <xref target="MBMS"></xref>) is used to describe MBMS broadcast mode
        media. The attribute may be used at session level to set the default
        for all media and at media level to specify differences between media.
        However, the attribute is never used at session level when the session
        includes MBMS multicast mode media, nor at media level to describe
        MBMS multicast mode media.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="FEC Flow ID Attribute">
        <t>The media-level attribute "a=mbms-flowid" (see 8.3.1.9 of <xref
        target="MBMS"></xref>) maps one or more FEC source block flow IDs to
        their corresponding destination IP addresses and UDP port numbers. It
        is present in each SDP media block for repair packet streams.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MBMS Repair Attribute">
        <t>The session and media-level attribute "a=mbms-repair" (see 8.3.1.8
        of <xref target="MBMS"></xref>) is used to provide FEC repair packets
        with non-FEC specific parameters. FFor release 6, one such parameter
        is defined to specify the required minimum receiver buffer time.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-sdp-proto" title="SDP Protocol Identifiers for FEC">
        <t>MBMS defines a mechanism to provide block-based FEC for UDP-based
        traffic. This solution uses the SDP protocol "proto" identifier to
        identify the media streams that use the FEC shim layer. The media
        streams may be either source streams or repair streams. As required by
        <xref target="RFC4566">SDP</xref>, these protocol identifiers are
        normatively defined in this document in accordance with their usage
        specified by 3GPP.</t>

        <section title="RTP Protocol Identifiers">
          <t>For FEC-protected RTP streams, the following two "proto"
          identifiers are defined: <list style="symbols">
              <t>UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/AVP</t>

              <t>UDP/MBMS-FEC/RTP/SAVP</t>
            </list>They indicate the usage of <xref
          target="RFC0768">UDP</xref> with MBMS FEC Source packet formats, as
          defined in Section 8.2.2.4 of <xref target="MBMS"></xref>, that
          transport RTP packets in accordance with the <xref
          target="RFC3551">AVP</xref> or SAVP (Secure RTP) <xref
          target="RFC3711"></xref> profiles, respectively. These protocol
          identifiers SHALL use the FMT space rules that are used for RTP/AVP
          and RTP/SAVP, respectively.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="FEC Repair Data Identifier">
          <t>A media stream carrying MBMS FEC repair information over UDP
          requires its own "proto" identifier. Protocol identifier
          "UDP/MBMS-REPAIR" identifies the FEC repair packet containing the
          protocol combination of <xref target="RFC0768">UDP</xref> and FEC
          repair payload ID and repair symbols as specified in Section 8.2.2.5
          of <xref target="MBMS"></xref>. The FMT string is not used and SHALL
          be set to "*".</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Video Buffering Attribute">
        <t>The PSS media-level buffer attribute "a=X-initpredecbufperiod"(See
        Section 4.1) that specifies an initial buffering time is also used for
        MBMS in Release 7. It is mainly intended for video streams, but may be
        used for other media types as well (See Section 8.3.1.1 of <xref
        target="MBMS"></xref>).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="SDP Offer/Answer Consideration">
      <t>The usage of the SDP attributes in an Offer/Answer <xref
      target="RFC3264"></xref> context is not defined. These SDP attributes
      are defined for being used in a declarative context, and for PSS
      specifically in RTSP <xref target="RFC2326"></xref> context.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PSS RTSP Extensions">
      <t>The RTSP extensions for PSS consist of a number of new RTSP headers
      and option tags and a narrowing of URI usage in regards to 3GP files.
      The headers and option tags are informatively described here; see
      [PSS-234] for the normative declaration.</t>

      <section title="3GPP-Link-Char Header">
        <t>The "3GPP-Link-Char" header (see 5.3.2.1 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) is used by clients to provide the server
        with QoS information about the wireless link it is currently using.
        The header can be used to provide the server with three different QoS
        parameters:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Guaranteed Bandwidth</t>

            <t>Maximum Bandwidth</t>

            <t>Maximum Transfer Delay</t>
          </list>The header may be included in RTSP requests using either of
        the methods SETUP, PLAY, OPTIONS and SET_PARAMETER.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="3GPP-Adaptation Header">
        <t>The "3GPP-Adaptation" header (see 5.3.2.2 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) is used by the client to provide the server
        with adaptation-related parameters and to indicate support of the
        adaptation function. The header carries the resource identification as
        a URI, the client's buffer size, and the desired target time.</t>

        <t>The header may be included in requests using the methods SETUP,
        PLAY, OPTIONS and SET_PARAMETER. The response to a request using this
        method shall include this header.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="3GPP-QoE-Metrics Header">
        <t>The "3GPP-QoE-Metrics" header (see 5.3.2.3.1 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) is used to negotiate the usage of the
        quality of experience (QoE) metrics (see Section 11 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>).</t>

        <t>The header may be included in requests and responses using the
        SETUP, SET_PARAMTER, OPTIONS or PLAY method.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="3GPP-QoE-Feedback Header">
        <t>The "3GPP-QoE-Feedback" header (see 5.3.2.3.2 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) is used to carry QoE metrics from the client
        to the server when it reports, which happens either during or at the
        end of the media delivery.</t>

        <t>The header may be included in requests using the SET_PARAMETER,
        PAUSE, or TEARDOWN method.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Video Buffer Headers">
        <t>PSS uses several headers to provide the client with the different
        buffer parameters. They provide the buffer status at the point of a
        stream that a PLAY request plays from. These headers may only be used
        in PLAY responses. See Section 5.3.2.4 and Annex G of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref> for normative definitions.</t>

        <t>The three "x-" headers were defined in 3GPP Release 5. When it was
        realized that they should not have been given "x-" names, it was to
        late rename them due to deployment.</t>

        <t>The RTSP headers are: <list style="symbols">
            <t>x-predecbufsize</t>

            <t>x-initpredecbufperiod</t>

            <t>x-initpostdecbufperiod</t>

          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Integrity Protection">
        <t>The integrity-protection mechanism defined in PSS Annex K uses the
        "3GPP-Freshness-Token" (See Section K.2.2.4 of <xref
        target="PSS-234"></xref>) RTSP header to carry a freshness token in
        DESCRIBE requests.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTSP URI Extension">
        <t>The PSS specification also defines syntax for referencing tracks
        within the "3GP" file format <xref target="PSS-3GP"></xref>. The 3GP
        format is based on the ISO base media file format and defined in
        several different profiles, including a streaming-server profile, in
        Release 6.</t>

        <t>This syntax is fully contained within the generic URI syntax
        defined for RTSP URIs. It is only a syntax restriction that server
        manufacturers follow to allow clients or proxies to understand what
        encodes the track number in the URI. This is provided for information
        only.</t>

        <t>To identify a track within a 3GP file the last URI segment has to
        contain a structure that is &lt;alpha string&gt;=&lt;track nr&gt; (See
        5.3.3.1 of <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Fast Start-up and Content Switching">
        <t>Release 7 of PSS defines a number of extensions in terms of headers
        and option tags (See Section 5.5 of <xref target="PSS-234"></xref>)
        for support of fast start-up and switching of content for on-demand
        and live applications built on top of PSS. Clients are enabled to
        reuse the existing RTSP control session and RTP resources while
        switching to new content.</t>

        <t>The RTSP headers are: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Switch-Stream</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>SDP attributes are subject to modification by an attacker unless they
      are integrity protected and authenticated. The security consideration of
      the SDP specification <xref target="RFC4566"></xref> should be reviewed
      in this regard. The registered SDP attributes are vulnerable to
      modification attacks or removal, which may result in problems of serious
      nature, including failure to use service and reduced quality.</t>

      <t>The registered RTSP headers are also vunerable to insertion, deletion
      or modification attacks similar to SDP attributes. Also in this case, it
      can result in failure of the service or reduced quality of streaming
      content.</t>

      <t>The three SDP protocol identifiers do not by themselves introduce any
      additional security threats that don't exist for other protocol
      identifiers in SDP. The media stream and the used protocols identified
      and configured by the SDP protocol identifier may however contain
      security issues by themselves.</t>

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


Abstract

   Virtually every application on the web today that allows a user to
   log in or manipulate information stored on a server maintains some
   form of state management information.  Usually, the session context
   is established through the use of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
   parameter or a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookie that
   identifies the session.  Without the use of Transport Layer Security
   (TLS), such an information exchange introduces a security risk.  For
   a variety of reasons, TLS may not be desired or preferred in all
   situations and, in those cases, users are left vulnerable.  This
   memo provides a simple method for enabling secure exchange of state
   management information through HTTP in situations where TLS is not
   employed.

1. Introduction

   Though we have HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) [2] for securing communication
   between HTTP [3] user agents (i.e., web browsers) and web servers,
   there are many web applications and web sites that rely on insecure
   connections to exchange state management information in the form of
   HTTP URL parameters or cookies [4] that could allow rogue entities
   to gain access to protected resources.  Even in environments where
   secure connections are used for initially authenticating users, the
   sessions established and associated with the User Agent often use a
   simple cookie exchange over an insecure connection for subsequent
   information exchanges, thus securing only the user's password, but
   not the session itself.  This allows HTTP sessions to be hijacked by
   any entity that can observe the state management information.  This

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


   memo provides a simple method for enabling secure exchange of state
   management information through HTTP in situations where TLS [5] is
   not employed.

   One could use HTTPS everywhere on the Internet, but there are
   reasons why that is not always desired or preferred:

   1. In practice, the use of HTTPS requires a unique IP address per
      URL (i.e., https://www1.example.com and https://www2.example.com
      would have to have two different IP addresses, even if these are
      on the same physical machines).  While Section 3 of RFC 4366 [6]
      does address this concern, widespread adoption is slow and does
      not address the other concerns listed below.

   2. Using HTTPS consumes more processing time and resources, an issue
      that is only compounded when there are several small transactions
      over separate connections.

   3. Using HTTPS on the Internet requires the purchase of digital
      certificates and, depending on one's environment, this can be
      costly. It is understood that private networks can use self-
      signed certificates, but that does not address the more general
      Internet use cases.

   4. Installing and updating digital certificates takes time, thus
      increasing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

   5. Expired certificates drive visitors away in fear due to security
      warnings presented by web browsers.

   6. Encrypting the entire session is not needed in many instances,
      especially when communicating with web sites that only exchange
      publicly available information (e.g., bulletin boards and blogs).
      Even though encryption is not critical for some applications,
      most would agree that proper state management is nonetheless
      important.

   7. Encrypting the entire session prevents routers or other devices
      from efficiently compressing otherwise highly compressible plain
      ASCII text over low bit-rate links.

   For one or more of these stated reasons, many web applications
   exchange state management information that should be secured over
   insecure connections.  Therefore, application developers need a
   method of providing an acceptable level of security for selected
   state management information that does not require the use of HTTPS.

   In our previous draft, we proposed the use of "Secure Cookies".
   This was met with mixed reactions.  Some supported the idea of


Salgueiro, et al.      Expires August 20, 2012                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


   introducing a cookie that could be secured, but some rightfully
   argued that cookies themselves could be encrypted at the server and
   so there was no need to secure the cookie.  Rather, we need to focus
   only on securing the session.  Our previous draft still enabled a
   Man-In-The-Middle attack when using HTTP, even when security
   credentials were exchanged over a secure connection.

   In this draft, we allow the client and server to establish one or
   more security associations over HTTP or, preferably, HTTPS.  For the
   purpose of this memo, a security association is defined by use of a
   specific Message Authentication Code (MAC) function along with a
   shared secret.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

3. Capability Advertisement

   In every request from the user agent to the server, the user agent
   MUST advertise its support for the Secure State Management
   procedures defined in this document.  This is necessary in order to
   establish the initial security association, but is also necessary in
   order to force a client to re-establish a security association that
   is no longer valid or no longer recognized by the server.

   The capability advertisement comes in the form of a header that
   enumerates the Message Authentication Code (MAC) functions supported
   by the user agent.  The syntax of the new header, like other headers
   introduced in this memo, follows the syntax of other headers in HTTP
   and is:

      SSM-Functions = "SSM-Functions" ":" MAC-Function
                      *["," *SP MAC-Function]

      MAC-Function = "hmac-md5" | "hmac-sha-1" | "hmac-sha-256" |
                      "hmac-sha-512" | 1*token

   Note that the comparison of MAC functions names MUST be case
   insensitive.  In this document, the MAC functions all utilize the
   HMAC [11] specification, though clients and servers MAY support
   other MAC functions.

   Clients MAY support any number of MAC functions, but MUST support
   either HMAC with MD5 [10] ("hmac-md5") or HMAC with SHA-1 [9]
   ("hmac-sha-1").  Servers MUST support both hmac-md5 and hmac-sha-1
   and SHOULD support a wide variety of popular MAC functions.


Salgueiro, et al.      Expires August 20, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


   Using the above syntax, the following is an example header
   transmitted by a user agent:

      SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1

   Note that the server always selects the MAC function to employ from
   among those offered by the client.

4. Security Associations

   In order to provide a means of exchanging information securely in a
   session, the client and server must establish one or more security
   association(s).  The association defines the MAC function and shared
   secret to be used when transmitting information between the client
   and server.

   The security association is assigned a handle by the server and is
   used in subsequent requests from the client.  The format of that
   association handle is discussed in Sections 5 and 6.

   In order to allow for multiple concurrent requests, a client MAY
   establish multiple security associations with the server.  For
   example, each tab on a web browser MAY establish its own
   client/server security association.  Additionally, a client assigns
   a session handle for each concurrent session that exists within the
   scope of the security association.  A client MUST NOT issue
   concurrent requests that utilize the same security association
   handle and session handle, as the server will not be able to
   differentiate between legitimate requests and requests that are, in
   fact, replay attacks.  A client MAY issue concurrent requests that
   utilize the same security association handle and different session
   handles.

   Once an association has been established, it MAY be used
   subsequently over either HTTP or HTTPS when the client issues
   requests to the server.

4.1. Establishing a Security Association

   To issue a request that allows for the possibility of establishing a
   new security association, the user agent sends a message to the
   server with a SSM-Functions header, such as the following:

      GET / HTTP/1.1
      SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1

   In the following two sections, we discuss how a security association
   is established using HTTPS or HTTP (with Diffie-Hellman).

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


4.2. Establishing a Security Association over HTTPS

   The server SHOULD use HTTPS as the means of establishing the
   security association.  By using HTTPS, the encryption key is
   transmitted as plaintext over the encrypted HTTPS connection from
   the server to the client.

   Once the security association is created via HTTPS, the client may
   be directed to use HTTP for subsequent requests.  SSM-Parameters
   header may then be used to transmit requests over HTTP and be
   assured that the important parts of the request or response will not
   be manipulated.

   When using HTTPS and establishing a new security association, the
   server MUST reply to requests that contain the SSM-Functions header
   and that do not demonstrate having a valid security association with
   a 401 Unauthorized as shown below:

      HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
      WWW-Authenticate: SSM assoc=12345, func=hmac-sha-1, secret=yyyy

   In the above, there are several parameters that are introduced that
   need discussion.  They are:

      assoc

         This is an association handle assigned by the web server.
         This handle is comprised of ASCII characters constrained to
         upper or lowercase letters and digits (ALPHA and/or DIGIT as
         defined in 2.2 of [3]).  The length of this handle MUST NOT
         exceed 64 octets.

      func

         This is the MAC function selected by the server.  The server
         MUST specify exactly one MAC function.

      secret

         This parameter contains the Base64-encoded shared secret in
         network byte order that will be used when computing the MAC
         transmitted from or to the server.  The number of octets that
         comprise the secret MUST be equal to or greater than the
         number of octets produced by the MAC function or, if
         applicable, the underlying hash function, whichever is
         greater.  However, the number of octets that comprise the
         secret should not be more than two times the number of octets
         produced by the selected function.  (For example, HMAC-SHA-1
         produces a 20-octet MAC.  Therefore, the shared secret should


Salgueiro, et al.      Expires August 20, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


         be between 20 and 40 octets, inclusive.)  Note that the secret
         must be Base64-decoded prior to consumption by the MAC
         function.

   The reason for replying with a 401 rather than returning a 200
   response to the request along with a security key is that the client
   may wish to transmit state management information, but does not have
   a valid security association that it can utilize.  The 401 response
   allows the server to reject the request and establish a security
   association that may then be used subsequently in requests from the
   client.

   Once the client has received this information, it MAY re-issue the
   request as in the following example:

      GET / HTTP/1.1
      SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1
      SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; session=1; nonce=1;
                components=Request-Line;
                mac=2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed

   As shown in this example, the User Agent continues to advertise the
   supported MAC functions. This is necessary in case the association
   expires between requests, prompting the server to return a 401
   Unauthorized to facilitate the establishment of a new association.
   Note that the length of time that a server wishes to allow an
   association to remain valid is outside the scope of this memo.

   In cases where the client and server are communicating using HTTP
   and the server wishes to force the client to switch transports to
   HTTPS to transmit a shared secret, the server rejects the HTTP
   request as shown below:

      HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
      WWW-Authenticate: SSM transport=https, port=443

   In the above, there is a single case-insensitive parameter called
   "transport" and an optional "port" parameter that defaults to port
   443.  The only value presently defined for transport is "https".
   When the client receives this response, it re-issues the request
   using HTTPS.  This will result in a subsequent 401 similar to the
   first example in this section wherein the server provides the shared
   secret to the client. Once the client has the shared secret in hand,
   it then re-issues the request using HTTP (not HTTPS).

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


4.3. Establishing a Security Association using Diffie-Hellman

   HTTP servers MAY use a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange [7] to
   establish a security association that will be used to encrypt
   sensitive state management information.

   It is a well-known fact that use of Diffie-Hellman is subject to a
   Man-in-the-Middle attack.  While this security vulnerability exists,
   it is nonetheless better than the situation we have today where
   anyone can easily grab state management information and hijack a
   session.  Further, a Man-in-the-Middle attack requires an active
   attacker, whereas session stealing is a much easier passive attack.

   In situations where transmitted information is sensitive or the risk
   of a Man-in-the-Middle attack is significant, HTTPS SHOULD be used
   to establish security associations.

   When using HTTP to establish a new security association, the server
   MUST reply to requests that do not contain a security association
   with a 401 Unauthorized as shown below:

      HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
      WWW-Authenticate: SSM assoc=12345, g=2, p=yyyy, A=xxxx,
                        func=hmac-sha-1

   In the above, there are several parameters that facilitate the DH
   key exchange and establishment of an association.  They are:

      assoc

         This is an association handle assigned by the web server.
         This handle is comprised of ASCII characters constrained to
         upper or lowercase letters and digits (ALPHA and/or DIGIT as
         defined in 2.2 of [3]).  The length of this handle MUST NOT
         exceed 64 octets.

      g

         The value "g" is a primitive root mod "p" as defined by the DH
         key exchange algorithm.  This parameter is OPTIONAL and, when
         absent, the value 0x02 MUST be assumed.

      p

         This is a large prime number that MUST be used by the client
         and server as a part of the DH key exchange algorithm.  This
         parameters is OPTIONAL and, if absent, the value used MUST be
         0xDCF93A0B883972EC0E19989AC5A2CE310E1D37717E8D9571BB7623731866
         E61EF75A2E27898B057F9891C2E27A639C3F29B60814581CD3B2CA3986D268

         3705577D45C2E7E52DC81C7A171876E5CEA74B1448BFDFAF18828EFD2519F1
         4E45E3826634AF1949E5B535CC829A483B8A76223E5D490A257F05BDFF16F2
         FB22C583AB.

      A

         This is the result computed by the server A=g^a mod p, where
         "a" is a secret large integer not transmitted over the
         network.

      func

         This is the MAC function selected by the server.  The server
         MUST specify exactly one MAC function.

   Once the client has received this information, it MUST complete the
   DH key exchange and association establishment by re-issuing the
   request as in the following example:

      GET / HTTP/1.1
      SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1
      SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; nonce=1; components=Request-Line;
                B=zzzz; mac=2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed

   As shown in this example, the User Agent continues to advertise the
   supported MAC functions.  This is necessary in case the association
   expires or otherwise becomes invalid between requests, prompting the
   server to return a 401 Unauthorized to facilitate the establishment
   of a new association.  Note that the length of time that a server
   wishes to allow an association to remain valid is outside the scope
   of this memo.

   Included in the above request is the header SSM-Parameters, which
   completes the association.  It includes several parameters that are
   included in all requests from the client when exchanging secure
   state management information.  We will cover the majority of the
   parameters in Section 5, but we will discuss the B parameter here
   since it applies only when initially establishing a security
   association using Diffie-Hellman:

      B

         This is the result computed by the client B=g^b mod p, where
         "b" is a secret large integer not transmitted over the
         network.

   Subsequent requests from the client to the server need not include
   the "B" parameter as a part of the SSM-Parameters header, since the

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


   association would have been fully formed and SHOULD be ignore by the
   server when received.

   Per the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, a shared secret is derived from
   the values created locally and received over the network from the
   peer.  The shared secret, K, is an integer that MUST be consumed by
   both the client and server in the same way.  Therefore, the value K
   MUST be converted into a string of octets in network byte order.
   The shared secret is the n least significant bits, where n is the
   number of bits equal to two times the number of bits generated by
   the selected MAC function or, if applicable, the underlying hash
   function, whichever is greater.  If the integer is too small to
   yield enough bits, then the most significant bits of the shared
   secret MUST be zero-filled until the length is n bits long.

   Integers defined in this section that are transmitted in messages
   (i.e., A, B, g, and p) MUST be represented in network byte order,
   zero-filling the most significant bits in order to fit the integer
   into an integral number of octets, then Base64-encoded.

   Note that all integers are positive numbers and care should be taken
   to ensure that the most significant bit is not misinterpreted to be
   a sign bit.

5. Transmitting Information from the User Agent

   When issuing requests to the server and having what it believes to
   be a valid association handle, the user agent MUST include the SSM-
   Functions and SSM-Parameters headers in the request.  The following
   example shows such a request:

      GET / HTTP/1.1
      SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1
      SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; session=1; nonce=1;
                      components=Request-Line;
                      mac=2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed

   There are several parameters included in the SSM-Parameters header
   as described below:

      assoc

         This is an association handle assigned by the web server and
         MUST be provided exactly as it was received.  The client MUST
         NOT assume this handle is encoded in any particular way.

      session




Salgueiro, et al.      Expires August 20, 2012                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


         This is an optional session handle created by the user agent
         to enable it to issue concurrent requests using the same
         security association.  This handle is comprised of ASCII
         characters constrained to upper or lowercase letters and
         digits (ALPHA and/or DIGIT as defined in 2.2 of [3]).  The
         length of this handle MUST NOT exceed 64 octets.  If this
         handle is absent, the server MUST assume the session handle
         has the value NULL (i.e., zero-length string).  Note that,
         while a client can generate any number of session handles, the
         web server is not required to track more than 128 handles per
         security association.  {Editor's note: in order to allow
         browser windows and JavaScript code to issue requests using
         the same security association, perhaps a JavaScript function
         should be provided by the browser to assign a unique session
         identifier?}

      nonce

         The nonce is a monotonically increasing integer in the range
         from 0 to 2^64 - 1.  To enable concurrent requests, each
         session identified by the session parameter has its own nonce
         space.  It is presented and consumed by the MAC function in
         ASCII text form.  Once this integer reaches 2^64, a new
         association MUST be created.  The user agent selects the
         initial value for the nonce, which is RECOMMENDED to be a
         random value in the range of 0 to 2^32 -1.

      components

         This optional parameter contains a comma-separated list of
         message components that are included in the message over which
         a MAC is computed.  Those components MAY be any one of these
         components defined in [3]:

         Request-Line
         Status-Line
         message-header
         message-body

         If used, the message-body MUST be consumed by the MAC function
         without modification.  All other components MUST be consumed
         by the MAC function as-is (including all whitespace and the
         colon that separates the header from its value), except that
         any CR or LF characters MUST NOT be consumed.  Each of the
         components is consumed by the MAC function in the order in
         which they are presented in the components parameter.

         Headers used to generate the MAC MAY appear more than once in
         the message.  In such a case, all headers with the same name

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


         must be consumed in the order transmitted on the wire.  It is
         ill-advised to include headers that are intended to be
         modified my intermediaries, such as the Via header, as doing
         so will likely result in errors computing the MAC.

      mac

         The mac parameter is a case-insensitive hex representation of
         the Message Authentication Code generated by the MAC function
         in use with this security association, presented in network
         byte order.  The mac is computed as follows:

            mac = message_authentication_function(secret,message);

         where

            message = (Request-Line ||
                       Status-Line  ||
                       message-header ||
                       message-body ||
                       assoc ||
                       session ||
                       nonce);

         The value of secret is the octets obtained from decoding the
         Base64-encoded secret parameter in the WWW-Authenticate header
         (when using HTTPS) or the n least significant bits of K when
         using Diffie-Hellman as explained in Section 4.3.

         It is permissible to indicate in the components that a non-
         existent header or a zero-length message body is used as a
         part of the "message".  In that case, there is nothing to
         concatenate and there is no impact on the "message" over which
         the MAC is generated, but does add to the integrity of the
         request or response.  For example, indicating that the
         message-body is a part of the "message" when a message-body
         does not exist prevents an intermediary from altering or
         fabricating the message-body.

   The server is able to associate the client using the association
   handle.  It is able to validate the request by computing the MAC
   following the same recipe and comparing the computed MAC value with
   that received from the client.

   If the server is unable to verify the MAC, the server MUST return a
   401 prompting the client to attempt to create a new association.
   However, the server MUST NOT invalidate the association handle,
   since the reason the MAC may have failed to compare properly is



Salgueiro, et al.      Expires August 20, 2012                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


   because a rogue user agent is attempting to use a handle not
   assigned to it.

   If the server receives a request from a client using a nonce value
   that is less than a nonce value already presented by a trusted user
   agent, then the server MUST return a 401 error.  The server MUST NOT
   invalidate the association, since a rogue user agent may attempt to
   re-use a previously used nonce value.

6. Transmitting Information from the Server

   When a client send a request message to the server as described in
   Section 5, the server MUST include in the response an SSM-Parameters
   header as shown in this example:

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; session=1; nonce=1;
                      components=Status-Line,Set-Cookie,message-body;
                      mac=3931ff3e9a70d77c6b677b95d9ab7c6aed80d610

   The parameters are identical to those defined in Section 5.  One
   important point to note is that the nonce value in the response MUST
   match the nonce value used in the request.

   If the client receives a response from the server containing a MAC
   that it cannot validate, then it must treat the response as invalid.
   There are only three possible reasons why the MAC does not validate,
   which include a software logic error, modification of the message as
   it passed through the network, or data corruption (either on the
   wire or at the remote server).  Assuming the latter, the client MAY
   re-issue the request, but repeated failure to validate the MAC would
   suggest messages are being altered.

7. Example Usage to Log into a Social Network Service

   In this section, we will discuss a typical exchange where a user
   visits a social network service and logs in.

   The initial request from the client is a typical request to get the
   main page of the site.  At the outset, there are no security
   associations nor a need for one.  A user agent might transmit the
   following request:

     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Host: social.example.com
     SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1

   In response, the server will return a web page that introduces the
   social site:


Salgueiro, et al.      Expires August 20, 2012                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

   Included in the response would be the message body containing HTML
   with various link, including a link to a "login" page.  Note that,
   up to this point, no security association has been established with
   the server.

   The user then clicks on the button to log into the service.  This
   link directs the user agent to a login page served over an HTTPS
   connection.  The initial user agent request might look like this:

     GET /login/ HTTP/1.1
     Host: social.example.com
     SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1

   At this point, the server returns a response to form the security
   association:

      HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
      WWW-Authenticate: SSM assoc=12345, func=hmac-sha-1,
                        secret=Y3VwaWQ=

   The user agent then re-issues the request to the server, but this
   time including the information to demonstrate that the security
   association has been formed:

     GET /login/ HTTP/1.1
     Host: social.example.com
     SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1
     SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; nonce=1; components=Request-Line;
                     mac=f1784693e4bdefa9b5a1a0348fdc0791c307ed9a

   Note that since a "session" parameter was not provided, the server
   assumes the value of "session" is NULL.

   The server can then validate the MAC to ensure that the client has
   formed the association.  The server will then respond to the request
   with a new HTML page that prompts the user for a login and password,
   like this:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; nonce=1; components=Status-Line;
                     mac=2b5cb730dac7e93e3c991918c503c8e87bd7cc82
     Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

   The user enters his username and password and click a button on the
   browser that results in a POST to the web server, like this:



Salgueiro, et al.      Expires August 20, 2012                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


     POST /login/process/ HTTP/1.1
     Host: social.example.com
     SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1
     SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; nonce=2;
                     components=Request-Line,message-body;
                     mac=d632e1b7bc895fc2ce7752bade188b85f5d1c93a
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
     Content-Length: 32

     user=someuserid+password=abcd123

   Upon receiving this request and successfully validating the MAC and
   authenticating the user, the web server might then redirect the user
   agent to an HTTP-accessible page (versus HTTPS) where the user can
   then interact with the social network service.  This redirection
   might look like this:

     HTTP/1.1 302 Found
     Location: http://social.example.com/home/
     SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; nonce=2; components=Status-Line;
                     mac=27283a874b10b9d86b50d3fa7426dd275afaeb02
     Content-Length: 0

   Note that the 302, while not a final response to the original HTTP
   request, is considered as such for the purposes of this memo.  The
   next request to the same host, security association, and session
   MUST use a different nonce in order to avoid a replay attack.

   Since the host did not change, the user agent may assume that the
   security association is still valid.  It then issues the following
   request:

     GET /home/ HTTP/1.1
     Host: social.example.com
     SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1
     SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; nonce=3; components=Request-Line;
                     mac=4e51022cb7c25cc1706056d85f34a095e4a6e4e5

   Knowing that user "someuserid" logged in and was associated on the
   server with the association handle "12345" and validating the MAC,
   the server may then serve the content that it should provide to that
   user.  It does so with a normal 200 response that includes the HTML
   or other content.

   While the user is interacting with the server, additional tabs or
   background threads may be launched that perform parallel requests to
   the server.  Each of these separate windows or threads must use a
   different and unique "session" attribute.  The following request,



Salgueiro, et al.      Expires August 20, 2012                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         Secure State Management            February 2012


   for example, might be issued by a background thread that polls a
   user's message inbox:

     GET /inbox/ HTTP/1.1
     Host: social.example.com
     SSM-Functions: hmac-md5, hmac-sha-1
     SSM-Parameters: assoc=12345; session=ajax-thread-6; nonce=346353;
                     components=Request-Line;
                     mac=fbeb80b87dd8f03c418d44e4129006dca6a42dd7

8. Security Considerations

   Some procedures defined in this memo rely on the Diffie-Hellman key
   exchange algorithm, which are subject to a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
   Users should be aware of this fact and utilize HTTPS to establish a
   security association as per Section 4.2 whenever one needs to guard
   against such attacks.

   Note that traditionally, HTTP cookies are used to associate a user
   with a user agent.  The procedures defined in this memo allow the
   server to identify the user via an association handle.  If HTTP
   cookies are used in conjunction with the Secure State Management
   procedure defined herein, then the server should verify that the
   cookie(s) used to identify a user map to the same user identified by
   the association handle.

   The procedures defined in this memo are not a replacement for HTTPS
   and merely serve to strengthen the use of HTTP over insecure
   connections that wish to provide for exchange of secure state
   management information.

9. IANA Considerations

   TBD.

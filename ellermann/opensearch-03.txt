          The application/opensearchdescription+xml media type
                     draft-ellermann-opensearch-03

Abstract

   This draft suggests to register the
   application/opensearchdescription+xml media type for OpenSearch
   descriptions.  Atom and XHTML <link rel="search" .../> elements are
   examples where this media type is used.

Internet-Draft           OpenSearch Description            November 2011


1.  Introduction

   This draft suggests to register the
   application/opensearchdescription+xml media type for OpenSearch
   descriptions.  Atom and XHTML <link rel="search" .../> elements are
   examples where this media type is used.

   It can be discussed in <http://groups.google.com/group/opensearch> or
   on the <mailto:ietf-types@iana.org> mailing list.  Because this draft
   is not (more) intended to be published as RFC the normative and
   informative references are actually only "further readings".


2.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations are a part of the IANA (Section 3) media
   subtype registration template.


3.  IANA Considerations

   Below you find the [RFC4288] registration template for the subtype
   "opensearchdescription+xml" of the "application" media type under
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/>:

   Type name:      application

   Subtype name:   opensearchdescription+xml

   Required parameters:
                   There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:
                   charset (defaults to "UTF-8")

   Encoding considerations:
                   Identical to those of "application/xml" as described
                   in [RFC3023]; especially "UTF-8" [RFC3629] and its
                   proper subset "US-ASCII" are supposed to work.

                   For non-ASCII documents served as "text/xml" the
                   "charset" parameter is required; this might be
                   relevant when authors are unable to configure the
                   server hosting their OSD (OpenSearch Description
                   document).

   Security considerations:
                   All general security and privacy considerations for
                   sending queries to servers specified in an URL are
                   applicable.

                   Where clients support the optional update feature in
                   OSDs it affects the privacy of users.

                   The EcmaScript API AddSearchProvider() typically
                   enforces a "same origin" policy for the OSD; the URL
                   element within the OSD can designate a third party as
                   search provider.

                   An OSD can claim to be a search description for X,
                   but actually do something else.

   Interoperability considerations:
                   OpenSearch descriptions use the
                   <http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/> XML name
                   space, optionally in conjunction with other XML name
                   spaces for extensions or for application specific
                   purposes.

   Published specification:
                   <http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/1.1/>

   Applications that use this media type:
                   Various Web browsers, search engines, and software
                   libraries support OSDs.  The "search" link relation
                   is used on many Web pages with this media type.

                   The EcmaScript API AddSearchProvider() documented for
                   WhatWG HTML uses this media type.

   Additional information:
                   OSDs have no "magic numbers" as defined in RFC 4288.
                   There are no special "common file name extensions"
                   for OSDs, OSDs are XML documents.  If specific
                   extensions are desired the conventional ".osdx" or
                   ".a9.xml" might do the trick.

4.  Acknowledgments

   As always John Klensin is an inspiration for all kinds of "process
   experiments" not limited to [RFC3933] and [RFC4897].  Thanks to Mark
   Nottingham for registering the "search" link relation, to Ian Hickson
   for documenting window.external.AddSearchProvider() in [WhatWG] HTML,
   to Sam Ruby for validating OSDs at <http://feedvalidator.org/>, and
   to DeWitt Clinton for specifying [OpenSearch] with the OpenSearch
   community.

   Paul Libbrecht suggested to add a clipboard name and MAC OS9 file
   type code if applicable.  Neither [RFC4288] nor [OpenSearch] offer
   any applicable info.

   Thanks also to Henrik Levkowetz, Julian Reschke, and the "happy IANA"
   folks.

Appendix A.  Document History

   Changes in version 03:

   *  Fixed the bogus "no RFC" boilerplate used in version -02:  Only
      this draft is not more intended to be published as RFC.  Everybody
      is free to create derivative IETF drafts.

   *  Updated the credits based on a discussion on the
      <mailto:ietf-types@iana.org> mailing list.

   *  Updated the [WhatWG] reference; xml2rfc is notoriously hostile to
      any "as of today" concepts.  Removed explanation that xml2rfc
      strict="yes" insists on the presence of Section 2.

   *  Checked [I-D.freed-media-type-regs] for suggested new tricks wrt
      clipboard names, MAC OS9 file type codes, or grandfathered media
      subtype name squatting in the standards tree.

   Changes in version 02 (2011):

   *  Plan B:  Nobody is going to write an RFC for this media type;
      especially nobody is going to create a formal XML DTD or similar
      definition above what is already documented in the OpenSearch 1.1
      specification.

   *  [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header] replaced by [RFC5988].  Removed
      the registration of link relation "search", because that already
      happened based on [RFC5988].

   *  Removed everything related to RFCXXXX, this draft is not more
      intended to be published as RFC.

   *  Updated the credits.  Populated the "TBD" placeholders in the
      template Section 3.

   Changes in version 01 (2008):

   *  Move registry cleanup from Section 5 to the (hopefully) next
      [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header].

   *  Adopt registration template in [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header]
      replacing the similar [RFC4287] template.

   *  Some background info with examples parked in the introduction.

   Initial version:

   *  This is a kind of template that could be extended to register
      rel="search" and application/opensearchdescription+xml if the
      OpenSearch community likes this approach.

   *  The change controller for a media type in the standards tree has
      to be a SDO (Standards Development Organization) recognized by the
      IESG or IAB on behalf of the IETF community, not necessarily the
      IETF itself.

   *  For atom:link relations IESG review is good enough.  Informational
      IETF RFCs are approved by the IESG in a "document action", this
      would trigger the IANA considerations in Section 3.

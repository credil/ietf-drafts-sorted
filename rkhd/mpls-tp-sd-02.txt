1. Introduction

   Telecommunication carriers and network operators expect to replace
   aged TDM Services (e.g. legacy VPN services) provided by legacy TDM
   equipment by new VPN services provided by MPLS-TP equipment.

   From a service level agreement (SLA) point of view, service quality
   and availability degradation are not acceptable, even after migration
   to MPLS-TP equipment.

   In addition, from an operational point of view, the same performance
   monitoring granularity provided by TDM networks is expected from
   MPLS-TP networks. For example, OAM maintenance points should remain
   in the same locations after TDM to MPLS-TP migration, as SLA revision
   is typically NOT feasible for telecommunication carriers and network
   operators.

   MPLS-TP LSP protection switching can be triggered by fault conditions
   and external manual commands. Fault conditions include Signal
   Failure (SF) and Signal Degrade (SD). Both conditions can be
   detected at an intermediate link based on lower layer indications or
   other sub-layer techniques.

   Since the protection switching is not necessarily managed by the
   transport entity that detects the condition, an impaired link condition
   indication must be sent over affected LSPs.

   This document describes guidelines for BER-related SF and SD detection 
   by lower layers indication, and a mechanism for relaying the degraded 
   LSP condition to the network element handling the LSP protection 
   switching.

3. SF/SD defects and MPLS-TP protection switching

   Network survivability, as defined in [2], is the ability of a
   network to recover traffic delivery following failure or degradation
   of network resources. [5] defines an LSP protection mechanism and
   state machine that handles SF, SD and operator manual commands.

   In this document, SF refers exclusively to defects derived from 
   link impairment (i.e. high BER), as opposed to defects detected 
   through OAM mechanisms (e.g. LOC condition) which are outside the 
   scope of this document.

4. Link impairment detection method

4.1. Guidelines for detection

   The common basis for the guidelines set forth in this section is that
   SF and SD conditions SHOULD reflect only BER conditions in the LSP 
   lower layers, without any influence from non-BER-related conditions 
   such as network congestion, CPU overload, selective packet discard, 
   etc.

   The following conditions SHOULD be met by the SF and SD condition 
   detection mechanism:

   o  Method for determining SF and SD MUST not disrupt the
      services transmitted over the link (e.g. add delay or jitter to
      real-time traffic)

   o  Criterion for determining SF and SD MUST be agnostic to the
      length of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining SF and SD MUST be agnostic to the
      transmission rate of frames transmitted over the link

Internet-Draft        draft-rkhd-mpls-tp-sd-02              March 2011


   o  Criterion for determining SF and SD MUST be agnostic to the
      type of service carried by the frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining SF and SD MUST be agnostic to the
      traffic class of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining SF and SD MUST be agnostic to drop-
      precedence marking of frames transmitted over the link

   o  Criterion for determining SF and SD MUST be agnostic to link
      congestion level

   o  Criterion for determining SD SHOULD be able to detect low BER 
      levels (e.g. 10E-8)

   o  Criterion for determining SF and SD SHOULD have low
      misdetection probability

   o  Criterion for determining SF and SD SHOULD have low false
      alarm probability

   o  Criterion for determining SF and SD SHOULD be agnostic to
      number of LSPs or PWs forwarded over the link

   o  SF and SD conditions MUST be monitored by the lowest server
      layer or sub-layer that is not terminated between monitoring
      points

   o  It is RECOMMENDED that the method for determining SF and SD
      does not require transmission of additional traffic

   Detection of SF and SD conditions is typically based on the same 
   information source. SF and SD conditions have each a different
   associated error rate threshold.  


4.2. Examples for detection methods

   o  A Server MEP [4] related to SONET or SDH sub-layers can determine
      SF and SD conditions based on error indication from parity 
      information in the path overhead.

   o  A Server MEP related to OTN sub-layer can determine SF and SD 
      conditions based on error indications from Forward-Error-Correction
      functionality inherent in encapsulation.

   o  A Server MEP related to 10GE PCS sub-layer can determine SF and SD 
      conditions based on rate of errored 66-bit block headers.

   o  A Server MEP related to 1GE PCS sub-layer can determine SF and SD 
      conditions based on rate of 10-bit code violations dispersion
      errors.

   As specified in section 4.1, these examples assume that the layer
   carrying the information used for SF and SD detection is not
   terminated by non-MPLS-TP-LSR entities (e.g. media converter).

5. Transmission of link impairment fault indication

   When SF condition is detected, a link failure fault indication
   SHOULD be transmitted over affected LSPs, in the downstream
   direction from the detection point. The link failure indication
   will be transmitted immediately following the detection and
   periodically until the SF condition is removed. The messages will be
   terminated and handled by the downstream MEP.

   When SD condition is detected, a link degradation fault indication
   SHOULD be transmitted over affected LSPs, in the downstream
   direction from the detection point. The link degradation indication
   will be transmitted immediately following the detection and
   periodically until the SD condition is removed. The messages will be
   terminated and handled by the downstream MEP.

   The encapsulation and mechanism defined in [3] is suitable for
   transmission of link failure and degradation fault indications. 
   It is RECOMMENDED that [3] will include these definitions in future
   work.

6. Handling of link failure and degradation fault indications

   LSR behavior upon receiving link failure and degradation fault
   indications is out of the scope of this document.

   SF and SD condition processing and prioritization for protection 
   triggering is defined in [5].

7. Security Considerations

   To be added in a future version of the document.

Internet-Draft         LDP Muti Topology Extension              Oct 2009


Abstract

   Multi-Topology (MT) routing is supported in IP through extension of
   IGP protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS.  Each route computed by OSPF
   or IS-IS is associated with a specific topology.  Label Distribution
   Protocol (LDP) is used to distribute labels for FECs advertised by
   routing protocols.  It is a natural requirement to extend LDP in
   order to make LDP be aware of MT and thus take advantage of MT based
   routing.

   This document describes options to extend the existing MPLS
   signalling protocol (LDP) for creating and maintaining Label
   Switching Paths (LSPs) in a Multi-Topology enviroment.

1.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document

      MT-ID: A 12 bit value to represent Multi-Topology ID.

      Default Topology: A topology that is built using the MT-ID value
      0.

      MT topology: A topology that is built using the corresponding
      MT-ID.


2.  Introduction

   There are increasing requirements to support multi-topology in MPLS
   network.  For example, service providers may want to assign different
   level of service(s) to different topologies so that the service
   separation can be achieved.  It is also possible to have an in-band
   management network on top of the original MPLS topology, or maintain
   separate routing and MPLS domains for isolated multicast or IPv6
   islands within the backbone, or force a subset of an address space to
   follow a different MPLS topology for the purpose of security, QoS or
   simplified management and/or operations.

   OSPF and IS-IS use MT-ID (Multi-Topology Identification) to identify
   different topologies.  For each topology identified by a MT-ID, IGP
   computes a separate SPF tree independently to find the best paths to
   the IP prefixes associated with this topology.

   For FECs that are associated with a specific topology, we propose to
   use the same MT-ID of this topology in LDP.  Thus the Label Switching
   Path (LSP) for a certian FEC may be created and maintained along the
   IGP path in this topology.

   Maintaining multiple MTs for MPLS network in a backwards-compatible
   manner requires several extensions to the label signaling encoding
   and processing procedures.  When label is associated with a FEC, the
   FEC includes both ip address and topology it belongs to.

   There are two possible solutions to support MT awared MPLS network
   from MPLS forwarding point of view.  The first one is to map label to
   both ip address and the corresponding topology.  The alternative one
   is to use label stacks.  The upper label maps to the topology, the
   lower label maps to the ip address.  The first option does not
   require change to data plane, and it could use multiple labels for
   the same address on different topologies.  The second option requires
   two lookups on data forwarding plane, and it can use the same label

   for the same address on different topologies.

   There are a few possible ways to apply the MT-ID of a topology in
   LDP.  One way is to have a new TLV for MT-ID and insert the TLV into
   messages describing a FEC that needs Multi-Topology information.
   Another approach is to expand the FEC TLV to contain MT-ID if the FEC
   needs Multi-Topology information.

   MT based MPLS in general can be used for a variety of purposes such
   as service separation by assigning each service or a group of
   services to a topology, where the managment, QoS and security of the
   service or the group of the services can be simplified and
   guaranteed, in-band management network "on top" of the original MPLS
   topology, maintain separate routing and MPLS forwrding domains for
   isolated multicast or IPv6 islands within the backbone, or force a
   subset of an address space to follow a different MPLS topology for
   the purpose of security, QoS or simplified management and/or
   operations.

   One of the use of the MT based MPLS is where one class of data
   requires low latency links, for example Voice over Internet Protocol
   (VoIP) data.  As a result such data may be sent preferably via
   physical landlines rather than, for example, high latency links such
   as satellite links.  As a result an additional tolology is defined as
   all low latency links on the network and VoIP data packets are
   assinged to the additional topology.  Another example is security-
   critical traffic which may be assigned to an additional topology for
   non-radiative links.  Further possible examples are file transfer
   prtocol (FTP) or SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) traffic which
   can be assigned to additional topology comprising high latency links,
   Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) versus Internet Protocol version 6
   (IPv6) traffic which may be assigned to different topology or data to
   be distingushed by the quality of service (QoS) assinged to it.


3.  Associating a FEC or group of FECs with MT-ID

   This section describes two approaches to associate a FEC or a group
   of FECs to a MT-ID in LDP.  One way is to have a new TLV for MT-ID
   and insert the MT-ID TLV into messages describing a FEC that needs
   Multi-Topology information.  Another approach is to extend FEC TLV to
   contain the MT-ID if the FEC needs Multi-Topology information.

3.1.  MT-ID TLV

   The new TLV for MT-ID is defined as below:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:
     U and F bits:
       As specified in [RFC3036].

     TLV Code Point:
       The TLV type which identifies a specific capability.

     MT-ID is a 12-bit field containing the ID of the topology
     corresponding to the MT-ID used in IGP and LDP. Lack of MT-ID TLV
     in messages MUST be interpreted as FECs are used in default
     MT-ID (0) only.

    A MT-ID TLV can be inserted into the following LDP messages as
    an optional parameter.

      Label Mapping           "Label Mapping Message"
      Label Request           "Label Request Message"
      Label Abort Request     "Label Abort Request Message"
      Label Withdraw          "Label Withdraw Message"
      Label Release           "Label Release Message"

    The message with inserted MT-ID TLV associates a FEC in same message
    to the topology identified by MT-ID.

3.2.  FEC TLV with MT-ID Extenstion

   The new TLV for MT-ID is defined as below:

     The extended FEC TLV has the format below.

     |                                                               |
     ~                                                               ~

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


      This new FEC TLV may contain a number of FEC elements and a MT-ID.
      It associates these FEC elements with the topology identified by
      the MT-ID. Each FEC TLV can contain only one MT-ID.

                     Figure 2: Extended FEC with MT-ID


4.  LDP MT Capability Advertisement

   The LDP MT capability can be advertised either during the LDP session
   initailizatin or after the LDP session is setup.

   The capability for supporting multi-topology in LDP can be advertised
   during LDP session initialization stage by including the LDP MT
   capability TLV in LDP Initialization message.  After LDP session is
   established, the MT capability can also be advertised or changed
   using Capability message.

   If an LSR has not advertised MT capability, its peer must not send
   messages that include MT identifier to this LSR.

   If an LSR receives a Label Mapping message with MT parameter from
   downstream LSR-D and its upstream LSR-U has not advertised MT
   capability, an LSP for the MT will not be established.

   If an LSR is changed from non MT capable to MT capable, it sets the S
   bit in MT capability TLV and advertises via the Capability message.
   The existing LSP is treated as LSP for default MT (ID 0).

   If an LSR is changed from MT capable to non-MT capable, it may
   initiate withdraw of all label mapping for existing LSPs of all non-
   default MTs.  Alternatively, it may wait until the routing update to
   withdraw FEC and release the label mapping for existing LSPs of
   specific MT.

   There will be case where IGP is MT capable but MPLS is not and the
   handling procedure for this case is TBD.

4.1.  Session Initialization

   In an LDP session initialization, the MT capability may be advertised
   through an extended session initailization message.  This extended
   message has the same format as the original session initialization
   message but contains the LDP MT capability TLV as an optional
   parameter.

   The format of the TLV for LDP MT is specified in the [LDPCAP] as
   below:

      S-bit:
        The State Bit indicates whether the sender is advertising or
        withdrawing the capability corresponding to the TLV Code Point.
        The State bit is used as follows:

            1 - The TLV is advertising the capability specified by the
                TLV Code Point.
            0 - The TLV is withdrawing the capability specified by the
                TLV Code Point.

5.  LDP Sessions

   Depending on the number of label spaces supported, if a single gloabl
   label space is supported, there will be one session supported for
   each pair of peers, even there are multiple topologoies supported
   between these two peers.  If there are different label spaces
   supported for different topologies, which means that label spaces
   overlap with each other for different MTs, then it is suggested to
   establish multiple sessions for multipple topologies between these
   two peers.  In this case, multiple LSR-IDs need to be allocated
   beforehand so that each multiple topology can have its own label
   space ID.

   This section is still TBD.

                      Figure 6: Label Request Message

   In the DU mode, when a label mapping is received by a LSR which has a
   downstream with MT capability advertised and an upstream without the
   MT capability advertised, it will not send label mapping to its
   upstream.

   in the DoD mode, the label request is sent down to the downstream LSR
   until it finds the downstrream LSR which doesn't support the MT, then
   the current LSPR will send a notification to its upstream LSR.  In
   this case, no LSP is setup.

   We propose to add a new notification event to signal the upstream
   that the downstream is not capable.

9.  MPLS Forwarding in MT

   Although forwading is out of the scope of this draft.  For the
   completness of discussion, we include some forwarding consideration
   for informational purpose here.

   In MT based MPLS network, forwarding will be based not only on label,
   but also on MT-ID associsted with the label.  There are multiple
   options to do this.  Below, we list two options.

9.1.  Use Label for (FEC, MT-ID) Tuple

   The first option we suggest is that MPLS forwarding for different
   topologies is implied by labels.  This approach does not need any
   change to the exsiting MPLS hardware forwarding mechanism.  It also
   resolves the forwarding issue that exists in IGP multi-topology
   forwarding when multiple topologies share an interface with overlay
   address space.

   On a MT awared LSR, each label is associated with tuple: (FEC,
   MT-ID).  Therefore, same FEC with different MT-ID would be assigned
   to different labels.

   Using this option, for tuple (FEC-F, MT-ID-N1) and (FEC-F, MT-ID-N2),
   each LSR along the LSP path that is shared by topology MT-ID-N1 and
   MT-ID-N2 will allocate different labels to them.  Thus two different
   Label Switching Paths will be created.  One for (FEC-F, MT-ID-N1) and
   the other for (FEC-F, MT-ID-N1).  The traffic for them will follow
   different Label Switching Paths (LSPs).

Internet-Draft         LDP Muti Topology Extension              Oct 2009


   Note, in this option, label space is not allowed to be overlapping
   among different MTs.  In the above example, each label belongs to a
   specific topology or the default topology.  MPLS forwarding will be
   performed exactly same as non-MT MPLS forwarding: using label to find
   output information.  This option will not require any change of
   hardware forwarding to commodate MPLS MT.  We will have different
   RIBs coresspoding to different MT IDs.  But we will only need one
   LFIB.




       Below is an example for option one:

           RIB(x) for MT-IDx:
                   FEC                       NEXT HOP
                   FECi(Destination A)       R1

           RIB(y) for MT-IDy:
                   FEC                       NEXT HOP
                   FECi(Destination A)       R2

           LFIB:
                   Ingress Label  Egress Label       NEXT HOP
                   Lm             Lp                 R1
                   Ln             Lq                 R2 (could be same as R1)

9.2.  Overlapping Label Space for MT

   In option 2, label spaces are overlapping with each other, which
   means same label value could be used for different MT.  In this
   option, MPLS forwarding will use one label for MT and one label for
   FEC.  Each forwarding entry will have an extra label stacked on the
   FEC label.  This extra label is used for MT identifer.  In this
   option, the default MT's label space and the label used for MT
   identifier are in the same label space.  For example, the forwarding
   entry in LIB looks like this:

9.3.  Comparing Option 1 and Option 2

   Option 1 is good for backward compatibility and it doesn't require
   hardware change.  The disadvantage is that the 20 bits of label space
   is shared by all MTs and label space for each MT is limited.  The
   advantage for option 2 is that each MT can have full label space.
   The disadvantage is that it needs hardware support to perform MPLS MT
   forwarding.  In addition, option 2 would require one more label
   lookup.


10.  Security Consideration

   MPLS security applies to the work presented.  No specific security

   issues with the proposed solutions are known.  The authentication
   procedure for RSVP signalling is the same regardless of MT
   information inside the RSVP messages.


11.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

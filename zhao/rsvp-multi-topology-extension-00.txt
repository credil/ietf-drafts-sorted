Internet-Draft        RSVP Muti Topology Extension              Oct 2009


1.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document

      MT-ID: A 12 bit value to represent Multi-Topology ID.

      Default Topology: A topology that is built using the MT-ID value
      0.

      MT topology: A topology that is built using the corresponding
      MT-ID.


2.  Introduction

   In Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks, a label may be
   assigned to represent a set of Forwarding Equivalent Classes (FEC) of
   packets and a mapping of the label and the FEC may be signaled along
   the path traversed by the packets.  Therefore, the label switched
   paths are established to forward packets.

   Resource reservation protocol (RSVP) is a network control protocol
   that may be used to enable applications to obtain different quality
   of service (QoS) for their data flows.  However, RSVP is not a
   routing protocol.  Rather, RSVP operates in conjunction with routing
   protocols.

   Resource reservation protocol traffic engineering (RSVP-TE) is an
   extension to RSVP that supports resource reservations across an
   Internet Protocol (IP) network.  Generally, RSVP-TE may be used to
   establish MPLS label switched paths (LSPs) with or without resource
   reservations, with consideration given to available bandwidth and a
   number of explicit hops.  The LSPs may be setup using explicit
   routes.  A variety of messages and procedures may be used by network
   elements to inform other network elements of the labels used for MPLS
   forwarding.  The LSPs may be treated as a tunnel, which is tunneling
   below normal IP routing and filtering mechanisms.

   A mechanism for Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol to support
   multi-topologies (MT) in IP networks, wherein Type of Service (TOS)
   based metric fields are redefined and used to advertise different
   topologies is disclosed in P. Psenak, et.al., "Multi-Topology (MT)
   Routing in OSPF," RFC 4915, June 2007, which is incorporated herein
   by reference.  Separate metrics may be associated for each TOS and
   may be advertised via protocol information exchange between network
   elements.  The existing OSPF protocol is extended to support network
   topology changes with Multi-Topology Identifier (MT-ID).

Internet-Draft        RSVP Muti Topology Extension              Oct 2009


   A mechanism within Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)
   to run a set of independent IP topologies for each network topology
   is disclosed in T. Przygienda, et.al., "M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT)
   Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs)", RFC
   5120, February 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference.  The
   existing IS-IS protocol is extended so that advertisements of
   adjacencies and reachable intermediate system within each topology
   are performed.

   Therefore, there is a need to have systems and methods for supporting
   multi-topology in MPLS network and extending the RSVP-TE protocol as
   a signaling protocol in the MPLS network to establish and maintain
   traffic engineered LSP tunnel within each network topology or across
   network topologies.  The LSP tunnel may need to follow a specific
   path or to reserve a certain amount of bandwidth to satisfy QoS
   requirements for the traffic flowing through the LSP tunnel within a
   specific network topology or across multiple network topologies.

   MT based MPLS in general can be used for a variety of purposes such
   as service separation by assigning each service or a group of
   services to a topology, where the managment, QoS and security of the
   service or the group of the services can be simplified and
   guaranteed, in-band management network "on top" of the original MPLS
   topology, maintain separate routing and MPLS forwrding domains for
   isolated multicast or IPv6 islands within the backbone, or force a
   subset of an address space to follow a different MPLS topology for
   the purpose of security, QoS or simplified management and/or
   operations.

   One of the use of the MT based MPLS is where one class of data
   requires low latency links, for example Voice over Internet Protocol
   (VoIP) data.  As a result such data may be sent preferably via
   physical landlines rather than, for example, high latency links such
   as satellite links.  As a result an additional tolology is defined as
   all low latency links on the network and VoIP data packets are
   assinged to the additional topology.  Another example is security-
   critical traffic which may be assigned to an additional topology for
   non-radiative links.  Further possible examples are file transfer
   prtocol (FTP) or SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) traffic which
   can be assigned to additional topology comprising high latency links,
   Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) versus Internet Protocol version 6
   (IPv6) traffic which may be assigned to different topology or data to
   be distingushed by the quality of service (QoS) assinged to it.


3.  Associating a RSVP message with MT-ID

   RSVP-TE objects may be utilized to indicate MT information by adding

   the multi-topology information in an RSVP-TE object carried in a
   RSVP-TE message.

   A preferred RSVP-TE object may be a session object.

   The capability for supporting multi-topology in RSVP can be
   advertised during RSVP session initialization stage by including the
   extended RSVP session object in the first RSVP path message.  After
   RSVP session is established, the following Path, Resv, PathErr,
   ResvErr and ResvConf messages will inlcude the session object in each
   message and the MT ID contained in the session object will let the
   receiver of the message to know which topology this message is for.

   This section describes an approach to associate a RSVP message with
   MT-ID specified in the session object.

5.  MPLS Forwarding in MT

   In MT based MPLS network, forwarding will not only be based on label,
   but also based on the MT-ID associsted with the label.  There are
   multiple options to do this.  Below, we list three options.

5.1.  Use Label for (FEC, MT-ID) Tuple

   The first option we propose is that MPLS forwarding for different
   topologies is implied by labels.  This approach does not need any
   changes to the exsiting MPLS hardware forwarding mechanism.  It also
   resolves the forwarding issue that exists in IGP multi-topology
   forwarding when multiple topologies share an interface with
   overlaying addresses.

   On a MT awared LSR, each label is associated with tuple: (FEC,
   MT-ID).  Therefore, same FEC with different MT-ID would be assigned
   to different labels.

   Using this option, for tuple (FEC-F, MT-ID-N1) and (FEC-F, MT-ID-N2),

Internet-Draft        RSVP Muti Topology Extension              Oct 2009


   each LSR along the path that is shared by topology MT-ID-N1 and MT-
   ID-N2 will allocate different labels to them.  Thus two distinguished
   Label Switching Paths will be created.  One (FEC-F, MT-ID-N1) and the
   other for (FEC-F, MT-ID-N1).  The traffic for them will follow
   different Label Switching Paths (LSPs).

   Note, in this option, label space is not allowed to be overlapping
   among different MTs.  In the above example, each label belongs to a
   specific topology or the default topology.  MPLS forwarding will be
   performed exactly same as non-MT MPLS forwarding: using label to find
   output information.  This option will not require any change of
   hardware forwarding to commodate MPLS MT.

   Note, We have different RIBs coresspoding to different MT IDs.  But
   we will only need one LFIB.

   Below is an example for option one:



           RIB(x) for MT-IDx:
                   FEC                       NEXT HOP
                   FECi(Destination A)       R1

           RIB(y) for MT-IDy:
                   FEC                       NEXT HOP
                   FECi(Destination A)       R1

           LFIB:
                   Ingress Label  Egress Label       NEXT HOP
                   Lm             Lp                 R1
                   Ln             Lq                 R2 (could be same as R1)

5.2.  Overlapping Label Spaces for MT

   In the option 2, label spaces are overlapping with each other, which
   means same label value could be used for different MT.  In this
   option, MPLS forwarding will use label value and the MT assocaited
   with label.  Each label forwarding entry will have an extra label
   stacked with the orginal label.  This extra label is used as the MT
   identifer.  For example, the forwarding entry in the LIB looks like
   this:

   Option 1 is good for backward compatibility and it doesn't require
   hardware change.  The disadvantage is that the 20 bits of label space
   is shared by all the MTs and label space for each MT is limited.  The
   advantage for option 2 is that each MT can have full label space.
   The disadvantage is that they need hardware support to perform MPLS
   MT forwarding.  In addition, option 2 require one more label lookup.

   Certain MT topologies are assigned to serve pre-determined purposes:

7.  Security Consideration

   MPLS security applies to the work presented.  No specific security
   issues with the proposed solutions are known.  The authentication
   procedure for RSVP signalling is the same regardless of MT
   information inside the RSVP messages.


8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

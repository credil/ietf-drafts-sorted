1. Introduction 

   This document analyzes the problems and limitation of the current 
   flat-structured Host Identity Tag (HIT, [RFC4423]) architecture in 
   the Host Identity Protocol (HIP, [RFC5201]). The document specifies a 
   hierarchical HIT architecture, which splits a HIT into two parts: a 
   HIP Administrative Domain (AD) ID and a local host ID. The proposed 
   hierarchical HIT architecture is also compatible with the flat-
   structured HIT architecture. The format of HIT and the detail process 
   of HIT generation are defined. This architecture and the process of 
   HIT generation ensure the global uniqueness of HITs. This 
   architecture also enables the multiple HIP administrative domains, 
   solves the deployment problem of current flat-structured HIT 
   architecture. The aggregation of HITs in this architecture also 
   enhances the scalability and resolution efficiency of the mapping 
   system from HIT to IP or FQDN. 

2. Analysis of the Current Flat-structured HIT Architecture 

   The HIT concept was defined in [RFC5201]: "... the Host Identity Tag 
   (HIT), becomes the operational representation. It is 128 bits long 
   and is used in the HIP payloads and to index the corresponding state 
   in the end hosts." 

   In order to be able to represent hosts, the uniqueness of HITs is 
   required in global scope. "In the HIP packets, the HITs identify the 
   sender and recipient of a packet. Consequently, a HIT should be 
   unique in the whole IP universe as long as it is being used." 
   [RFC4423] 

   Although mathematically "the probability of HIT collision between two 
   hosts is very low" [RFC5201], there is no mechanism to ensure that a 
   HIT is global unique. 

   The current defined HIT is generated according to the ORCHID 
   generation method described in [RFC4843]: "several possible 
   methods ... to preserve a low enough probability of collisions". 
   However, it cannot guarantee the global uniqueness of HITs. 
   Furthermore, while the number of end devices continuously grows in 
   the future, the possibility of HIT collision will increase rapidly. A 
   technical mechanism is needed to ensure the global uniqueness of HITs, 
   particularly with the consideration that collisions may happen. When 
   such collision happens, more than one hosts will have the same HIT. 
   Then, the HIT cannot uniquely identify a certain host.

   Although there is a rough solution for how to distinguish duplicated 
   HITs, it is far from a feasible or best solution. 

   [RFC4423] states "In the extremely rare case of a single HIT mapping 
   to more than one Host Identity, the Host Identifiers (public keys) 
   will make the final difference." It means the mapping system between 
   HIP and IP must store or at least be aware of the Host Identifiers of 
   all hosts. Given the facts that the Host Identifiers are quite large 
   and may be in various lengths, the storage and management burden of 
   the mapping system could be quite high. If there was a mechanism to 
   ensure the global uniqueness of HITs, then, the mapping system would 
   not have to be aware the Host Identifiers. 

   Furthermore, within the flat-structured HIT architecture, the 
   robustness of resolution efficiency in the supporting mapping system 
   is in a big question mark: a mapping server has to hold or at least 
   to be able to access a large database that contains information on 
   all HITs in the global scope. There more than a billion hosts now on 
   the Internet and a global deployment of HIP would require an equal 
   amount of HITs. In the future, there could be even billions of 
   machines or even higher. The storage burden, maintenance consumption 
   and synchronization updating are problems that are very difficult to 
   solve. If the HITs were organized hierarchically, the mapping system 
   could easily be organized hierarchically, even distributed. 

   One more disadvantage that the flat-structured HIT architecture is 
   the difficulties for management. There is nothing common between HITs 
   that were assigned by the same authority or that their represented 
   hosts have the same properties. Hence, it is difficult to categorize 
   HITs. Although this provides privacy to the end-hosts, the Access 
   Control Lists (ACLs) would have to have a full list of HITs 
   accessible to permitted services. Contrarily, the hierarchical HITs 
   are more aggregatable. It makes HITs manageable. HITs can be grouped 
   according to its belonging authority or domain. Each network operator 
   just needs to manage and maintain HITs and their mapping information 
   in a relatively small range. 

   According to the above analysis, it is natural to turn the flat HIT 
   architecture into hierarchy. It can effectively reduce the global 
   uniqueness requirement into much smaller scope uniqueness requirement. 
   In another word, if a hierarchical HIT with a global unique AD ID is 
   locally unique, it is guaranteed to be global unique. It can improve 
   the resolution processing and enhance the scalability and resolution 
   efficiency. Furthermore, it can optimize the management of both the 
   host identity and the mapping database. Each administrative domain is 
   responsible only for a part of the global HIT architecture. However, 
   it is useful that the new hierarchical HIT architecture is compatible

   with the flat HIT architecture for privacy purposes and other usage 
   scenarios. 

3. Hierarchical HIT Architecture 

   In this document, we introduce a two-level hierarchically structured 
   HIT architecture. HIT is "128 bits long value and is used in the HIP 
   payloads and to index the corresponding state in the end hosts." 
   [RFC5201] "In the HIP packets, the HITs identify the sender and 
   recipient of a packet." [RFC4423] HITs refer to nodes or virtual 
   nodes. All nodes are required to have at least one HIT. A single node 
   may also have multiple HITs. Applications on a same node may bind to 
   different HITs. 

   In the hierarchical HIT namespace, a 128-bit HIT consists of two 
   parts: an n-bit HIP AD ID and a (128-n)-bit local host ID. (n is a 
   subject to be decided in the future.) It can represent maximum 2^n 
   administrative domains and 2^(128-n) hosts within each administrative 
   domain. The Administrative Domain ID has embedded organizational 
   affiliation and global uniqueness. The local host ID is a hash over 
   the AD ID and the public key of the ID owner. 

   |           n bits              |            128-n bits           | 
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+ 
   |  HIP Administrative Domain ID |           local host ID         | 
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+ 

   For the secure consideration, we recommend to assign more bits to the 
   local host ID, which is a hash result, leaving less but enough bits 
   for HIP Administrative Domain ID. The more the number of bits the 
   local host ID is, the more secure it is against brute-force attacks. 
   In the worst case, if the hash algorithm cannot be inverted, the 
   expected number of iterations required for a brute force attack is 
   O(2^(128-n)) in order to find a host identity that matches with a 
   given local host ID. It should be noted that this draft does not take 
   into account the ORCHID prefix defined in [RFC4843] for two reasons: 
   firstly, ORCHID is only temporary assigned for experimental usage 
   till 2014 only. The proposal design in the document is targeting to 
   be used continuously after 2014. Secondly, the fixed 28-bit orchid 
   prefix reduces the security properties massively and increase 
   collusion possibility highly. 

   The HIP administrative domain, as its literal, is a logic region in 
   which the HIs of all nodes are assigned by the same authority. Within 
   a same HIP administrative domain, all the nodes should have the same 
   HIP AD ID or the same leftmost certain bits. Furthermore, the 
   authority may be organized internally hierarchically. 
 
 
Jiang, et al.          Expires April 25, 2010                 [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft   draft-jiang-hiprg-hhit-arch-03.txt       October 2009 
    

   The HIP AD ID should be assigned by a global administrative 
   organization with the principle that every HIP AD ID must be globally 
   unique. 

   Consequentially, the HIP AD IDs may be organized hierarchically. For 
   example, a big organization may obtain a block of HIP AD IDs with an 
   assigned 16-bit prefix. It then can assign 24-bit HIP AD IDs to its 
   sub-organizations. All these sub-organizations have the same leftmost 
   16-bit. 

   One promising allocation solution of HIP AD ID is following current 
   routable IP address allocation system [RFC2050]. At first IANA 
   allocates some HIP AD ID prefixes to RIR (Region Internet Registry) 
   or NIR (National Internet Registry),then RIR or NIR sub-allocates the 
   HIP AD ID prefix to LIR or backbone ISP that subdivides the tag 
   prefix to middle or small ISP. Historical experience of routable IP 
   address allocation indicates that the allocation system can ensure 
   global uniqueness of HIP AD IDs. 

   One advantage of this solution is that the HHIT architecture can 
   build distributed catalogue based on current IP address Internet 
   Registry. Each level Internet Registry only needs to maintain its 
   HHIT information. This catalogue is like current IP Whois Server 
   operated by each IP address Internet Registry. But it should include 
   many more attributes about a HHIT, such as organizational affiliation, 
   geographical information, privacy protection rule etc. The catalogue 
   should be independent of current IP Whois system and IP address 
   Internet Registry should provide some mechanism to translate HHIT to 
   its useful attributes on demand of various applications. 

   The local host IDs remains the original meaning of HIT - "a hashed 
   encoding of the Host Identity". For each HIP administrative domain, 
   it is mandatory to maintain the uniqueness of all local host IDs. It 
   is guaranteed by the process of generating a HIT, see Section 5. 

   For resolution purposes, HITs are aggregatable with AD IDs of 
   arbitrary bit-length, similar to IPv4 addresses under Classless 
   Inter-Domain Routing [RFC4632]. 

3.1. Compatible flat-structured HITs 

   Obviously, not all hosts are willing to use hierarchical HITs in all 
   scenarios for various reasons, such as privacy. Therefore, it is 
   useful that the hierarchical HIT architecture keep compatible with 
   the flat HIT architecture.

   The flat HITs can be defined as a specific sub-set of the 
   hierarchical HITs architecture. With the same reserved Flat HIT Tag 
   (3 or 4 bits) at the beginning, for example, the left-most 3 bits is 
   000, the flat HITs can be used as defined in [RFC4423]. 

   |                           128 bits                              | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ 
   |FHIT Tag|            Flat host identity tag                      | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ 

3.2. HITs on nodes 

   HIP-enabled nodes may have considerable or little knowledge of the 
   internal structure of hierarchical HITs, depending on the role the 
   node plays (for instance, host versus mapping server). At a minimum, 
   a node may consider pre-generated HITs have no internal structure: 

   |                           128 bits                              | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ 
   |                       host identity tag                         | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ 

   Only sophisticated hosts may additionally be aware of the type of 
   their HITS and use the hierarchical structure of HITs to simplify the 
   resolution procedure. 

4. Generating a hierarchical HIT 

   The process of generating a new hierarchical HIT takes three input 
   values: an n-bit HIP AD ID, a 2-bit collusion count, (an example, it 
   is a subject to be changed in the future.) the host identity (the 
   public key of an asymmetric key pair). A hierarchical HIT should be 
   generated as follows: 

      1. Set the 2-bit collision count to zero. 

      2. Concatenate from left to right the HIP AD ID, the collusion 
         count, and the host identity. Execute the SHA-1 algorithm on 
         the concatenation. Take the (128-2-n) leftmost bits of the 
         SHA-1 hash value. 

      3. Concatenate from left to right the n-bit HIP AD ID, the 2-bit 
         collusion count and (128-2-n)-bit hash output to form a 128-
         bit HIT. 

      4. Perform duplicate detection within the HIP administrative 
         domain scope. If a HIT collision is detected, increment the 
 
 
Jiang, et al.          Expires April 25, 2010                 [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft   draft-jiang-hiprg-hhit-arch-03.txt       October 2009 
    

         collision count by one and go back to step 2. However, after 
         four collisions, stop and report the error. (Note: the 
         duplicate detection mechanism is not discussed in this 
         document. It may be broadcast or central registration.) 

   The design that includes the HIP AD ID in the hash input is mainly 
   against the re-computation attack: create a database of HITs and 
   matching public keys. With the design, an attacker must create a 
   separate database for each HIP administrative domain. 

   The design reduces the number of bit of hash output 2 bits lower. It 
   does reduce the safety. However, O(2^(128-2-n)) iterations is large 
   enough to prevent brute-force attacks. 

   For security reason, the abovementioned SHA-1 hash algorithm may be 
   replaced by any safer algorithm. 

5. Requirements for modification on HIP 

   The usage of hierarchical HITs requires either a new version of HIP 
   protocol or a new critical flag in the header of HIP control packets. 
   The latter is considered easier and more fulfill. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The most important security property of HIT is that it is self-
   certifying (i.e., given a HIT, it is computationally hard to find a 
   Host Identity key that matches the HIT). Although this document 
   limits the hash output to be (128-2-n)-bit long, it does not affect 
   the self certifying security property. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines a new namespace: HIP AD ID. It is an n-bit long 
   value, which represents a globally unique HIP administrative domain. 
   IANA may found an authority institute to manage the global assignment 
   of HIP AD ID.

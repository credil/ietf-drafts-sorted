Abstract 

   A Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) is an IPv6 addresses 
   binding with a public/private key pair. However, the current CGA 
   specifications are lack of procedures to enable proper management of 
   CGA generation. Administrators should be able to configure parameters 
   used to generate CGA. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for 
   IPv6 (DHCPv6), which enables network management to dynamically 
   configure hosts, can be used in the CGA configuration. Furthermore, 
   CGA generation consumes large computation power. This computational 
   burden can be delegated to the DHCPv6 server. A new DHCPv6 options 
   are also defined in this document to enable hosts delegate CGA 
   generation to a DHCPv6 server.

1. Introduction 

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA, [RFC3972]) provide means 
   to verify the ownership of IPv6 addresses without requiring any 
   security infrastructure such as a certification authority.  The use 
   of CGAs allows identity verification in different protocols, such as 
   SEure Neighbor Discovery (SEND, [RFC3971]), Enhanced Route 
   Optimization for MIPv6 [RFC4866] or Site Multihoming by IPv6 
   Intermediation (SHIM6 [RFC5533]). 

   However, as [PS-DC] analyses, in the current specifications, there is 
   a lack of procedures to enable proper management of CGA generation, 
   in particular, in the configuration of the parameters that define the 
   security properties of the addresses. Administrators should be able 
   to configure parameters used to generate CGA. The Dynamic Host 
   Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), which enables network 
   management to dynamically configure hosts, can be used in the CGA 
   configuration. For example, DHCPv6 server should be able to assign 
   subnet prefix or other relevant parameters to CGA address owner. In 
   some scenarios, the administrator may further want to enforce some 
   parameters, particularly, the demanded security related parameters 
   such as SEC value. 

   Additionally, CGA generation is computational consumption. It can be 
   a heavy burden for end-user devices, particular slow or battery-
   dependant devices. Currently, there are no means to delegate the 
   computation of the modifier, a CPU intensive operation, to faster or 
   non battery-dependant resources. It is possible that the whole or 
   part of CGA generation procedure is delegated to the DHCPv6 server. 

   This draft analyses the requirements raised by CGA configuration and 
   computational delegation for CGA generation. This draft provides 
   solutions for CGA configuration and delegated CGA generation. Two 
   existing DHCPv6 options are re-used. Two new DHCPv6 options are also 
   defined in this document. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3. Requirements 

   The CGA specifications [RFC3972] define the procedure to generate a 
   CGA. However, these procedures do not allow the enforcement of a 
   given configuration to a group of hosts. It does also not consider 
   the delegation of CPU-intensive operations to other nodes. In this 
   section, we analyze the scenarios in which these operations are 
   required. 

        3.1. Configuration of the parameters required for the generation 
           of CGA 

   The CGA associated Parameters used to generate a CGA includes several 
   parameters [RFC3972]: 

     - a Public Key, 

     - a Subnet Prefix, 

     - a 3-bit security parameter Sec. Additionally, it should be noted 
     that the hash algorithm to be used in the generation of the CGA is 
     also defined by the Sec value [RFC4982], 

     - a modifier that is selected so that the result of a hash to 
     comply with the requirements introduced by the value of a security 
     parameter Sec in order to provide protection against brute-force 
     attacks, 

     - a Collision Count value, increased each time the address 
     generated results in a collision in the subnet considered, 

     - any Extension Fields that could be used. 

   Currently, there are convenient mechanisms for allowing an 
   administrator to configure the subnet prefix for a host, by Router 
   Advertisement [RFC4862]. But other parameters used for generating the 
   CGA could not be configured by the administrator. 

   It would be useful if these parameters could also be configured by 
   the administrator. For instance, the administrator can determine, 
   according to the type of infrastructure and the security needs, the 
   Sec value that should be used by the hosts to generate the CGA. When 
   appropriate, the Extension Fields could also be mandated by the 
   administrator. 

   Upon reception of this information, the end hosts SHOULD generate 
   addresses compliant with the received parameters. If the parameters 
 
 
Jiang & Xia            Expires April 25, 2009                 [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft draft-jiang-csi-cga-config-dhcpv6-01.txt    October 2009 
    

   change, the end hosts SHOULD generate new addresses compliant with 
   the parameters propagated. 

        3.2. Offloading the large computational burden 

   An important case to consider is the large computational consumption 
   of the generation of the modifier field. The modifier is a 128 
   unsigned integer that is selected so that the Hash2 operation defined 
   in RFC 3972 results in the required number of leftmost 0 bits. The 
   higher the number of bits required being 0, the more secure a CGA is 
   against brute-force attacks. However, high number of bits also 
   results in additional computational cost for the generation process, 
   cost that could be deemed excessive in certain environments, such as 
   mobile terminals with low computing power. 

   As an example, consider a Sec value equals 2, requesting the leftmost 
   32 bits of a SHA-1 Hash2 to be zero. For assuring this, a system has 
   to generate in mean 2^32 different modifiers, and perform the Hash2 
   operation to check the bits required to be 0. An estimation of the 
   CPU power required to do this can be obtained as following: openSSL 
   can perform in an Intel Core2-6300 on an Asus p5b-w motherboard close 
   to 0.87 million of SHA-1 operations on 16 byte blocks per second. 
   Since the input data of Hash2 operation is larger than 16 bytes, this 
   value is an upper bound for the number of hash operations that can be 
   performed for generating the modifier. Checking 2^32 different 
   modifiers requires around 5000 seconds. The high number of required 
   operations can represent a problem for end hosts (i.e. mobile devices) 
   with much lower computing power than considered in the example, 
   and/or with restrictions in battery resources. 

   For these cases, a mechanism for delegating the computation of the 
   modifier should be provided. It is also possible that the whole CGA 
   generation procedure is delegated. 

4. DHCPv6 Approach 

   Among the mechanisms in which configuration parameters could be 
   pushed to the end hosts and/or CGA related information sent back to a 
   central administration, we discuss the stateful configuration 
   mechanism based on DCHPv6 in this document. Other mechanisms may also 
   provide similar functions, but out of scope. 

   DHCPv6 can be extended to: 

     - propagate to the end hosts the values of the parameters required 
     to configure CGAs,

     - receive requests for generating a CGA according to a given 
     security configuration, and returning the result to the end host. 

        4.1. Node requests CGA-related configuration parameters to the 
           DHCPv6 server 

   A node may initiate a request for the relevant CGA configuration 
   information needed to the DHCPv6 server. The server responds with the 
   configuration information for the node. The Option Request Option, 
   defined in Section 22.7 in [RFC3315], can be used for node to 
   indicate which options the client requests from the server. To 
   propagate the CHA-related parameters, the Identity Association for 
   Prefix Assignment Option defined in [HGID] and a new CGA-Sec Option 
   defined in Section 5.1 can be used. Of course, a node can also use 
   the sub-prefix received through Router Advertisement message 
   [RFC4861]. Future specification may define more options to carry CGA-
   related configuration parameters. 

   After receiving the configuration information, the node SHOULD 
   generate a CGA based on its public key and the configuration 
   information. The configuration of the client key pair or certificate 
   is out of scope. 

        4.2. Node requests CGA generation to the DHCPv6 server  

   A node may initiate a request for the computation of the modifier or 
   the CGA address for a certain security configuration to the DHCPv6 
   server. The node includes the values selected for the CGA associated 
   parameters, such as its public key, the value of the Sec parameter, 
   etc. The server either computes by itself, or redirects the 
   computation to other node using a mechanism that is out of the scope 
   of this document. Once the server generates or obtains the CGA, it 
   responds to the node with the resulting address and the CGA 
   Parameters Data Structure using the CGA Generation Request Option 
   defined in Section 5.2. 

5. New CGA-related DHCPv6 Options 

5.1. DHCPv6 CGA Sec Option 

   DHCPv6 CGA Sec Option is used to carry a Sec value, the parameters 
   associated with CGA generation on a client. After receiving the CGA 
   Sec Option, the client SHOULD generate a CGA using a Sec value that 
   is not lower than the option indicated.

5.2. DHCPv6 CGA Generation Request Option 

   DHCPv6 CGA Generation Request Option is sent by a client to request a 
   DHCPv6 server to generate a CGA address. After a DHCPv6 server 
   receives CGA-relevant parameters sent by the client, it generates a 
   CGA address based on these parameters and its own configuration. It 
   then replies the CGA address and associated CGA Parameters data 
   structure back to the client.

       Reserved        A 24-bit field reserved for future use. The 
                       value MUST be initialized to zero by the sender,

       Subnet Prefix   An IPv6 prefix provided by the client, used for

                       public key of the client. This public key will 
                       be used for CGA generation. 

       Extension Fields This is an optional variable-length field that 
                       is not used in the current specification. Future 
                       versions of this specification may use this 
                       field for additional data items that need to be 
                       included in the CGA Parameters data structure. 
                       Implementations MUST ignore the value of any 
                       unrecognized extension fields. 

   DHCPv6 server MAY use IA-NA or IA TA option with a CGA Parameter Data 
   Structure IA sub-option to return the CGA address and associated CGA 
   Parameters data structure back to the client. 

   DHCPv6 server MAY generate only a modifier and associated CGA 
   Parameters data structure if it can not perform duplicate address 
   detection, as per [RFC3971]. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The mechanisms based on DHCPv6 are all vulnerable to DOS attacks to 
   the server, such as request for large number of CGA generations. 
   Proper use of DHCPv6 autoconfiguration facilities [RFC3315], such as 
   AUTH option or Secure DHCP [SDHCP] can prevent these threats, 
   provided that a configuration token is known to both the client and 
   the server. 

   Note that, as expected, it is not possible to provide secure 
   configuration of CGA without a previous configuration of security 
   information at the client (either a trust anchor, a DHCPv6 
   configuration token...). However, considering that the values of 
   these elements could be shared by the nodes in the network segment, 
   these security elements can be configured more easily in the end 
   nodes than its addresses.

   Regarding to the configuration of the Sec parameter, one risk is that 
   a malicious node could propagate a Sec value providing less 
   protection than intended by the network administrator, facilitating a 
   brute force attack against the hash, or the selection of the weakest 
   hash algorithm available for CGA definition. However, even in the 
   worst case, if the hash algorithm cannot be inverted, the expected 
   number of iterations required for a brute force attack is O(2^59) in 
   order to find a CGA Parameters data structure that matches a given 
   CGA. Another risk is the use of a Sec, higher than intended by the 
   administrator, which would require a large number of resources of the 
   client to compute the modifier, requiring a long time before the 
   device can communicate. This can be considered a kind of DOS attack. 
   A variation of this attack is the propagation of different Sec values. 
   This kind of attack may be prevented by server authentication. 

   An attacker could send malicious CGA Generation Requests in order to 
   exhaust the server resources, since the CPU cost for the server can 
   be high, especially considering that the attacker could select a Sec 
   value requiring the highest number of computations for the server. 
   This kind of attack may be prevented by host-based authentication. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines two new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options, which must be 
   assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space for 
   DHCPv6 messages: 

   The DHCPv6 CGA Sec Option (TBA1), described in Section 5.1. 

   The DHCPv6 CGA Generation Request Option (TBA2), described in Section 
   5.2.

1. Introduction 

   In Neighbor Discover protocol (ND, [RFC4861]), routers and hosts 
   record the neighbor information in the local Neighbor Cache (NC) 
   database. It is vulnerable by DOS attacks. In the current definition, 
   it is difficult to detect whether the neighbor information are from a 
   real neighbor or a faked attacker. This document analyzes these 
   security threats. Although SEcure Neighbor Discovery Protocol (SEND) 
   is defined as upgrade/replaced version of ND, it is very complicated 
   and does not widely deployed yet. 

   This document proposes a Neighbor Cache protection solution, mainly 
   using reverse detection mechanism, to prevent the potential damage. 
   This solution is based on the procedures that already defined in the 
   current ND definition, so it is fully compatible with ND. This design 
   principle allows that most of network devices remain on their current 
   ND implementation, only the devices that need advanced NC protection 
   apply the proposed mechanism. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Neighbor Cache Threats 

   In the IPv6 edge network, hosts and routers use Neighbor Discovery 
   protocol to resolve the neighbors known to reside on attached links. 
   The neighbors' information, such as the paired mapping of link-layer 
   addresses and IPv6 addresses, is recorded in a local Neighbor Cache 
   database. 

   However, the NC is vulnerable by malicious attacks. A Denial of 
   Service (DoS) attack against the NC of an IPv6 node (host or router) 
   can fill up with faked entries and exhaust the cache's resources. 
   This interrupts the normal functions of the targeted IPv6 node. If 
   the attack is successful in overwhelming a forwarding router, the 
   edge network may be disconnected from the global Internet. By sending 
   a faked Neighbor Solicitation message, an attacker can make the 
   target node allocate a Neighbor Cache entry for a period of time. If 
   the attacker repeats the procedure using faked IPv6 addresses, the NC 
   will grow. Eventually the NC exhausts all memory allocated for it. 
   The same risks exist on proxies and normal hosts that implement 
   Neighbor Discovery protocol.

   For example, if the attackers send minimally sized Neighbor 
   Solicitation (NS) packets, which is 90 Bytes (14-Byte Ethernet header, 
   40B IPv6 header, 32B NS message, 4B trailer), to target router on a 
   100 Mbps Ethernet link, it can, in theory, build up and sustain 
   perhaps 145k bogus entries in the target's NC. Given that each entry 
   contains at least one Ipv6 address, one MAC address, a state and a 
   few flags, approximately 50 Bytes, this puts memory usage up in the 
   range of 8 MB in this example. This illustrates the scale of the 
   problems an attacker can cause on one interface. An attack on many 
   interfaces that is paired with distributed attackers will be manifold 
   worse. 

   DoS is the most considerable threat among with many others, analyzed 
   in Threats Analysis, Section 11.1, in [RFC4861]. SeND [RFC3971] 
   provides a feasible solution to these problems, based on 
   certification anchors on every network devices. It does require all 
   nodes on a local network to support SeND. The provision of 
   certificate anchors on every network devices is a tough deployment 
   challenges while there are secure issues for itself. 

4. Security Requirements 

   Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a defending mechanism 
   against DoS attacks targeting Neighbor Caches. This mechanism SHOULD 
   meet at least anti Dos, anti replay and anti spoofing (L3 spoofing) 
   requirements. 

   The focus for this effort, and the scope for this document explicitly 
   excludes, at this point in time, privacy (or encryption), 
   authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation. 

5. Solution: Reverse Detection 

   In order to protect the NC against malicious attacks, a Reverse 
   Detection (RD) mechanism is introduced. This solution is based on the 
   messages and the procedures that already defined in the current ND 
   definition, so it is fully compatible with ND. This design principle 
   allows that most of network devices remain on their current ND 
   implementation, only the devices that need advanced NC protection 
   apply the proposed mechanism. The following figure illustrates the NC 
   protection mechanism on a router. (The protected network devices may 
   be a host or a proxy [RFC4389] that implements ND protocol, besides a 
   router.)

           Figure: the example of reverse detection for NC protection 

   In the current ND definition, when a router received a RS (Router 
   Solicitation) / NS / NA (Neighbor Advertisement) message (action (1) 
   in the figure), it creates a new NC entry locally (action (5) in the 
   figure) and reply a RA (Router Advertisement) / NA to the node that 
   initiates this RS/NS/NA message action (6) in the figure). 

   According to the analysis in the Section 3, the RS/NS/NA message is 
   not verified at all. Attacks may be carried in these messages. A RD 
   procedure is added after the action (1). By receive the first 
   RS/NS/NA message, the router puts this message into a high speed NS 
   record table (action (2) in the figure). It then sends a RD NS 
   message to the initiated host (action (3) in the figure). The 
   initiated host responds a NS-replied NA message (action (4) in the 
   figure)  

   When the router received the RD-replied NA message, it decides 
   whether the pair of the source IPv6 address and the source MAC 
   address matches any entry in the NS records table. If so, fetch the 
   matched NS record and continue the normal CPU-based slow path NS 
   procedure (action (5) and (6) in the figure). 

6. Additional Discussion 

        6.1. Exceptional LLAs 

   Before the reverse detection, the router MAY check whether the 
   correspondent MAC address is in the local exceptional LLA table, 
   which stores a few high priority LLAs. If the NS message is from one 
   of such LLAs, the router SHOULD bypass the RD process.

Internet-Draft draft-jiang-v6ops-nc-protection-01.txt       March 2010 
    

   This saves message interaction delay for these high priority or 
   trustable hosts. 

        6.2. Looped reverse detection 

   If the initiated host is also NC protected, the reverse detection 
   described, in the Section 4, may be looped between the two devices. 
   In order to avoid the reverse detection loop, the Reverse Detection 
   message should be distinguished from other NS message and should not 
   initiate another RD procedure. 

        6.3. Rate limit for incoming NS 

   As a complementary method to Reverse Detection, router NC can be 
   protected by rate limiting NS traffic up to an acceptable threshold. 
   Configurable access rate allows for NS traffic to be matched based on 
   router interface or same LLA. 

        6.4. CPU & memory protection 

   The router may actively drop the NS, even it is valid, according to 
   the CPU or memory usage status. It prevents the target device from 
   functioning properly due to CPU deadlock or memory exhaustion. 

7. Security Considerations 

   The proposed NC protection mechanism may increase the new attack 
   mechanism based on the RD procedure: an attacker may send numerous 
   RD-NS messages to try to block a target. However, the reply procedure 
   of RD-NS consumes little CPU and memory. The attacker have to use 
   more resources to feasible such attack. The security risk of such 
   attack is very low.  

   The proposed NC protection mechanism cannot fully prevent the attacks 
   from MAC-spoofing attackers since their NS messages are no different 
   from the normal valid NS messages and they are able to respond to RD-
   NS messages. However, the RD NC protection mechanism greatly reduces 
   the security risk from such attackers. It forces that the attackers 
   wait RD procedures completed before they can change their MAC 
   addresses for the next round attack. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   This draft does not request any IANA action.

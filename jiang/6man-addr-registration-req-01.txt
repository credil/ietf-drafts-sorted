Abstract 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, node self-generated 
   addresses are notionally conflicted with the network managed address 
   architecture. These addresses need to be registered in the networking 
   management plate for the purposes of central address administration. 
   This document discusses the requirements of address registration and 
   analyzes the possible solutions.

1. Introduction & Requirements 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, node self-generated 
   addresses, such as addresses in IPv6 Stateless Address Configuration 
   [RFC4862, RFC4941] scenario and Cryptographically Generated Addresses 
   (CGA, [RFC3972]), is notionally conflicted with the network managed 
   address architecture, such as DHCPv6-managed network or network with 
   Access Control List, in which addresses are assigned and managed by 
   the network management plate. 

   The current IPv4 address allocation mode in DHCPv4-managed network is 
   that the DHCPv4 server assigns addresses. Many operators of 
   enterprise networks and similarly tightly administered networks have 
   expressed the desire to hold on to this model when moving to IPv6, 
   because they don't want to have hosts end up with essentially random 
   IPv6 addresses. However, the notion that a server assigns an address 
   is for the most part incompatible with IPv6 stateless configuration. 

   A useful way to give network administrators most of what they want, 
   while at the same time retaining compatibility with normal stateless 
   configuration would be: if the self-generated IPv6 addresses are  
   used, they may need to be registered in and granted by the networking 
   management plate. The node may be required to perform this 
   registration since only granted IPv6 addresses are allowed to be used 
   to access the network. 

   This document discusses the requirements of address registration and 
   analyzes the possible solutions. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
   for IPv6 (DHCPv6) and Router Advertisement may be extended to 
   propagate the address registration request from network management to 
   nodes. A DHCPv6 server may play the address registration server with 
   newly defined DHCPv6 options. However, this may conflict with the 
   original DHCP notion. A new set of protocol may have to be defined 
   for the address registration purpose. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3. Potential Solutions 

3.1. Generic Address Registration Procedure 

   By current default, the nodes with self-generated addresses do not 
   register their addresses to any network devices. However, this may 
   result that the network may reject the access request from these 
   devices. 

   As showed in below Figure 1, in the generic address registration 
   procedure, the network management plate should firstly propagate the 
   request of registering self-generated addresses. By received such 
   requests, a node using the self-generated address should send an 
   address registration message to the network management. The network 
   management should check whether the requested address is accepted, 
   for example, performing a Duplicated Address Detect or checking the 
   address does not use the Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers 
   [RFC5453]. If the requested address is accepted by the network 
   management, it is registered in the address manage database, which 
   may be used by other network functions, such as DNS or ACL. An 
   acknowledgement is sent to the node, granting the usage of this 
   address. If the requested address is not accepted by the network 
   management, a rejected acknowledgement is sent to the node to 
   indicate that it must generate a new address.

3.2. Propagating the Registration Request 

   In order to indicate or force the nodes with self-generated addresses 
   to register their addresses and the appointed address registration 
   server, a new request option needs to be defined.

   There are more than one mechanisms in which configuration parameters 
   could be pushed to the end hosts. The address registration request 
   option can be carried in Router Advertisement. In the DHCPv6 managed 
   network, it can also be carried in DHCPv6 messages. 

   By receiving attendant of the address registration request option, a 
   node MUST register its self-generated addresses, if there are any, to 
   the appointed registration server. The option may be defined to 
   include the default/enforced address registration server. 

3.3. Address Registration Server and Protocol 

   In order to manage the address, an address registration server is 
   needed with the support a set of address registration protocol. 

   The server should hold all registered addresses. It also needs to 
   check whether the addresses meet the network address management 
   policy, also performing a Duplicated Address Detect or checking the 
   address does not use the Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers 
   [RFC5453], etc. Its address data may be used by other network 
   functions, such as DNS or ACL. 

   A set of address registration protocol need to at least support a 
   basic information exchange: the node sends its address to the server 
   and an acknowledgement is sent to the node. 

3.3.1. Using DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 server 

   The current DHCPv6 protocol can be reused as the address registration 
   protocol while a DHCPv6 serve plays as address registration server.  

   The current DHCPv6 specification allows for a host to communicate a 
   set of "preferred" addresses to the server by listing these addresses 
   in IA options [RFC3315]. In order to response to registration 
   requests, an acknowledgement DHCPv6 option should be defined. It is 
   used to indicate whether the registration of an IPv6 address is 
   accepted. 

3.3.2. Defining a new address Registration Protocol 

   However, the address registration procedure using DHC protocol may 
   conflict with the initial notional of DHC protocol. The DHC protocol 
   was originally designed to push configuration information from the 
   network management side to the hosts while the address registration 
   procedure is collecting information from hosts to the network 
   management side.

   A new set of address registration protocol may be defined. 

   [Author notes for IETF discussion:] Any other existing protocol may 
   be used for address registration purposes? 

4. Security Considerations 

   An attacker may use a faked address registration request option to 
   indicate hosts reports their address to a malicious server and 
   collect the user information. These attacks may be prevented by using 
   secure protocols, in Neighbor Discovery protocol case, Secure 
   Neighbor Discovery (SEND, [RFC3971]); in DHCP case, Secure DHCP  
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6]; or other additional security  
   mechanisms. 

   An attacker could generate IPv6 address registration requests in 
   order to exhaust the server resources (or to impact on any other 
   operation that depend on the registration of the address). 

   In the use case of DHCPv6, the address registration procedure is as 
   vulnerable as all other mechanisms based on DHCPv6 to DOS attacks to 
   the server. Proper use of DHCPv6 autoconfiguration facilities 
   [RFC3315], such as AUTH option or Secure DHCP [I-D.jiang-dhc-secure-
   dhcpv6] can prevent these threats. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   There is no IANA considerations.

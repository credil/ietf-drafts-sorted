               <t>OAuth Access Tokens using credentials is a technique for allowing user agents
               to obtain an OAuth access token on behalf of a user without
               requiring user intervention or HTTP redirection to a
               browser. OAuth itself is documented in the OAuth Core 1.0
               Specification.

           <section title="Introduction">

               <t>
               The <xref target="OAUTH"/> Specification is a protocol that enables
               websites or applications to access protected web resources via an
               API, without requiring users to disclose their credentials. This
               draft defines a technique for allowing a user to provide their
               crendentials in cases where HTTP redirection to a browser is
               unavailable or unsuitable, such as intermediary aggregators and
               mobile or settop devices.

		<t>This scheme is intended for use where one or both of the

		<t>- the User is using a device that cannot play the HTTP

		model</t>

		<t>- the Consumer is an aggregator that will in any case, be
		presented with the credentials of the end-user</t>

		<t>If neither of the above apply, then this specification SHOULD NOT be used.</t>

		<t>In addition, the security considerations below MUST be
		followed, in particular the requirement that communications
		between the Consumer and Service Provider that contain the
		user's credentials MUST be sent via a confidential and mutually
		authenticated channel. That channel can be provided either via
		mutally-authenticated transport layer security or a virtual
		private network providing equivalent security functionality.
		See the security considerations section below for details.</t>

		<t>Once the Access Token has been acquired by the Consumer, then
		the security requirements of standard OAuth apply.</t>

	   </section>



<section title="Client request to obtain an Access token" anchor="creq">


<section title="Request" anchor="areq">

  <t>
   To request an Access Token in this model, the Consumer makes an HTTP request
   to the Service Provider's Access Token URL. The authentication request
   contains the following parameters:
   </t>
  
   <t>
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>x_auth_username - the login credential of the User the client is obtaining a token on behalf of.</t>
       <t>x_auth_password - the pass credential of the User the client is obtaining a token on behalf of.</t>
       <t>x_auth_mode - this value must "client_auth" (referring to the process described here)</t>
       <t>oauth_consumer_key - as defined by <xref target="OAUTH"/>.</t>
       <t>oauth_signature_method - as defined by <xref target="OAUTH"/>.</t>
       <t>oauth_signature - as defined by <xref target="OAUTH"/></t>
       <t>oauth_timestamp - as defined by <xref target="OAUTH"/></t>
       <t>oauth_nonce - as defined by <xref target="OAUTH"/></t>  
       <t>oauth_version - the client MAY send this parameter. If present, value
       MUST be 1.0 . Service Providers MUST assume the protocol version to be
       1.0 if this parameter is not present. </t>
     </list>
   </t>

  <t>The above parameters are contained in the HTTP Authorisation header or as
  URL parameters. Parameter names and values must be "percent-encoded" to handle
  characters in different character sets. The request SHOULD use HTTP POST.
  </t>   

</section>

<section title="Response" anchor="ares">
  <t>
    To grant an access token, the Service Provider MUST ensure that:
  </t>
  <t>
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>The request signature has been successfully verified as per <xref target="OAUTH"/>.</t>
      <t>A request with the supplied timestamp and nonce has never been received before.</t>
      <t>The supplied username and password match a User's credentials.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    If successful, the Service Provider generates an Access Token and Token
    Secret using a 200 Ok response and returns them in the HTTP response
    body. The response contains the following parameters:
  </t>
  <t>
    <list style="symbols">
      <t> oauth_token - The Access Token. </t>
      <t> oauth_token_secret - The Token Secret. </t>
      <t> x_auth_expires - a timestamp, in seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00, at
      which the Access Token expires, or 0 if no expiry is specified. </t>
      <t> Additional parameters- Any additional parameters, as defined by the
      Service Provider. </t>
    </list>
  </t>


</section>

<section title="Accessing Protected Resources" anchor="apr">
  <t>
    After successfully receiving the Access Token and Token Secret, the Consumer
    is able to access the Protected Resources on behalf of the User as per
    section 7 of <xref target="OAUTH"/>. In other words the Access Token
    obtained here is no different in capability to the Access Token specified by
    <xref target="OAUTH"/>. Once authenticated using the above process, the
    Consumer will sign all subsequent requests for the User's Protected
    Resources using the returned Token Secret.
  </t>
</section>

</section>





    <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>
            The authentication technique described here is based on HTTP and
            thus subject to the security considerations found in Section 15 of
            <xref target="RFC2616"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Sending a user name and password pair is contrary to the idea in <xref
          target="OAUTH"/> that a Consumer will not know the User's
          credentials. However without some way to transmit the credentials,
          there is no way to utilise <xref target="OAUTH"/> in scenarios where
          redirects to the Service Provider cannot be performed dynamically.
        </t>

	<t>
	When acquiring an Access Token via this scheme, the relevant communications
	between the Consumer and Service Provider MUST be strongly protected via a
	mutually authenticated and confidential channel. Such a channel can be provided
	via the use of mutually authenticated Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246"/>
	or an equivalent lower layer virtual private network (VPN), for example a 
	tunnel-mode VPN based on IPsec. <xref target="RFC4301"/>
	</t>

	<t>When HTTP is used over TLS, the conventions in <xref target="RFC2818"/>
	MUST be followed.</t>


        <t>
          Service Providers are advised to respond to unauthorized or
          unauthenticated requests using an appropriate 4xx HTTP response code
          (e.g., 401 "Unauthorized" or 403 "Forbidden") in accordance with <xref
          target="RFC2617"/>.
        </t>

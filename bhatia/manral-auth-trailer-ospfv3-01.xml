    <abstract>
      <t>Currently OSPFv3 uses IPsec for authenticating protocol packets. 
			However, there are some environments, e.g., Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), 
			where IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and this mechanism 
            cannot be used. This draft proposes an alternative mechanism that 
            can be used so that OSPFv3 does not depend upon IPsec for authentication.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> Unlike Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) <xref target="RFC2328"></xref>, 
		OSPF for IPv6 (OSPFv3)  <xref target="RFC5340"></xref>, does not include the  AuType 
		and Authentication fields in its headers for authenticating protocol packets.
		 Instead, OSPFv3 relies on the IPv6 Authentication Header (AH)<xref target="RFC4302"></xref> 
		and IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303"></xref>
		to provide integrity, authentication, and/or confidentiality.
   </t> <t>
	<xref target="RFC4522"></xref> describes how IPv6 AH and ESP extension headers can 
		be used to provide authentication and/or confidentiality to OSPFv3.
	</t> <t>
		However, there are some environments, e.g., Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), 
		where IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and this mechanism 
		cannot be used.  There is also an issue with IPsec not being available on
		some platforms or it requiring an additional license.
  </t> <t>
		<xref target="RFC4522"></xref>  discusses, at length, the reasoning behind 
		using manually configured keys, rather than some automated key management 
		protocol such as IKEv2 <xref target="RFC5996"></xref> . The primary problem 
		is the lack of suitable key management mechanism, as OSPF adjacencies 
		are formed on a one-to-many basis and most key management mechanisms
		are designed for a one-to-one communication model. This forces the system 
		administrator to use manually configured security associations (SAs) and
		cryptographic keys to provide the authentication and, if desired, confidentiality services.
	</t> <t>
		Regarding replay protection  <xref target="RFC4522"></xref>  states that:
	</t> <t>
		"As it is not possible as per the current standards to provide
		  complete replay protection while using manual keying, the 
		  proposed solution will not provide protection against replay 
		  attacks."
	</t> <t>
		Since there is no replay protection provided there are a number of 
		vulnerabilities in OSPFv3 which have been discussed in 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-opsec-routing-protocols-crypto-issues"></xref>.
	</t> <t>
		Since there is no deterministic way to differentiate between encrypted and 
		unencrypted ESP packets by simply examining the packet, it could become
		 tricky for some implementations to prioritize certain OSPFv3 packets 
		(Hellos for example) over the others.

	</t> <t> This draft proposes a new mechanism that works similar to OSPFv2 
		<xref target="RFC5709"></xref>for providing authentication to the OSPFv3 
        packets and attempts to solve the problems described above for OSPFv3. 

 	</t><t> Additionally this document describes how HMAC-SHA authentication 
		can be used for OSPFv3. </t>
   <t> By definition, HMAC (<xref target="RFC2104"></xref> , <xref target="FIPS-198"></xref>) 
		requires a cryptographic hash function. This document proposes to use any one of 
		SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 <xref target="FIPS-180-3"></xref> 
		to authenticate the OSPFv3 packets.
	</t><t>  It is believed that <xref target="RFC2104"></xref> is mathematically 
		identical to <xref target="FIPS-198"></xref> and it is also believed that 
		algorithms in <xref target="RFC4634"></xref> are mathematically identical
		 to <xref target="FIPS-180-3"></xref>.
	</t> </section>

      <section title="Proposed Solution">
	<t> To perform non-IPsec cryptographic authentication, OSPFv3
		routers append a special data block, henceforth referred to as, the
		authentication trailer to the end of the OSPFv3 packets. The length
		of the authentication trailer is not included into the length of the
		OSPFv3 packet, but is included in the IPv6 payload length. </t>

 <t> A new AT-bit (AT stands for Authentication Trailer) is introduced
       into the OSPFv3 Options field. OSPFv3 routers MUST set the AT-bit in 
       OSPFv3 Hello and Database Description packets to indicate that the 
	   OSPFv3 router will include the authentication trailer in all
	   OSPFv3 packets on the link. In other words, the authentication

	<t> Key Identifier (Key ID)  <vspace blankLines="1" />
		This is a 32-bit unsigned integer used to uniquely identify an OSPFv3 SA,

		The receiver determines the active SA by looking at the Key ID 
		field in the incoming protocol packet. <vspace blankLines="1" />

		The sender based on the active configuration, selects an SA 
		to use and puts the correct Key ID value associated with the SA

		SAs exist for a given interface, the sender may use any
	   of those SAs to protect the packet.<vspace blankLines="1" />

		Normally, an implementation would allow the network operator to configure a 
		set of keys in a key chain, with each key in the chain having fixed lifetime. 
		The actual operation of these mechanisms is outside the scope of this document.<vspace blankLines="1" />

		Note that each key ID can indicate a key with a different authentication protocol.

<section anchor="Crypto Aspects" title="Cryptographic Aspects">
	<t> In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, which

	H is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-256). <vspace blankLines="1" />	

	K is the Authentication Key for the OSPFv3 security association.<vspace blankLines="1" />	
 
	Ko is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm.<vspace blankLines="1" />	

	B is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits.<vspace blankLines="1" />	

	Note that B is the internal block size, not the hash size. </t>
	
   <list style="empty"> <t> For SHA-1 and SHA-256:   B == 64 </t>
     <t>For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128 </t>
	</list>

<t> L is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than bits.<vspace blankLines="1" />	

	XOR is the exclusive-or operation. <vspace blankLines="1" />	
	Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times. <vspace blankLines="1" />	
	Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times. <vspace blankLines="1" />	
	Apad is the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times.<vspace blankLines="1" />	

	Implementation Note:	<vspace blankLines="1" />	

	This definition of Apad means that Apad is always the same length as the hash output. 

	<list style="numbers"> 
	 <t> Preparation of the Key<vspace blankLines="1" />	
		In this application, Ko is always L octets long. <vspace blankLines="1" />
		If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is 
	   equal to K.  If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L 
	   octets long, then Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication 
	   Key (K) is less than L octets long, then Ko is set to the 
	   Authentication Key (K) with zeros appended to the end of the 
	   Authentication Key (K) such that Ko is L octets long. </t>

	<t> First Hash<vspace blankLines="1" />
		First, the OSPFv3 packet's Authentication Trailer (which is 
	   very similar to the appendage described in RFC 2328, Section 
	   D.4.3, Page 233, items(6)(a) and (6)(d)) is filled with the 
	   value Apad.<vspace blankLines="1" />
		Then, a First-Hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed 
	   as follows:<list style="empty"> <t> 
		First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (OSPFv3 Packet))</t></list>
		Implementation Notes:<list style="empty"> <t> 
		Note that the First-Hash above includes the 
       Authentication Trailer containing the Apad value, as well 
       as the OSPFv3 packet, as per RFC 2328, Section D.4.3.</t> </list>
		The definition of Apad (above) ensures it is always the same
	   length as the hash output.  This is consistent with RFC 2328.
	   The "(OSPFv3 Packet)" mentioned in the First-Hash (above) 
	   does include the OSPF Authentication Trailer. <vspace blankLines="1" />

	   The digest length for SHA-1 is 20 bytes; for SHA-256, 32 
	   bytes; for SHA-384, 48 bytes; and for SHA-512, 64 bytes. </t>

	<t> Second Hash <vspace blankLines="1" />
		Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is 
	   computed as follows:<vspace blankLines="1" />
		<list style="empty"> <t> Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash) </t> </list>
	</t>

	<t> Result <vspace blankLines="1" />
		The resulting Second-Hash becomes the authentication data 
   that is sent in the Authentication Trailer of the OSPFv3 
   packet. The length of the authentication data is always 
   identical to the message digest size of the specific hash 
   function H that is being used. <vspace blankLines="1" />

   This also means that the use of hash functions with larger 
   output sizes will also increase the size of the OSPFv3 packet 
   as transmitted on the wire.<vspace blankLines="1" />

   Implementation Note: <list style="empty"> <t> 
	RFC 2328, Appendix D specifies that the Authentication 
      Trailer is not counted in the OSPF packet's own Length 
      field, but is included in the packet's IP Length field.
      Similar to this, the Authentication Trailer is not 
      included in OSPFv3's own Length field, but is included
      in IPv6's payload length. </t></list>

		trailer by examining the AT-bit in the Options field in the OSPFv3 header

		packets will include the authentication trailer.<vspace blankLines="1" />

		Authentication algorithm dependent processing needs to be 
		performed, using the algorithm specified by the appropriate

		Before an implementation performs any processing it needs to save

		It should then set the Authentication data field with Apad before the 
		authentication data is computed. The calculated data is compared with 
		the received authentication data in the Authentication trailer and the

		an error event SHOULD be logged. <vspace blankLines="1" />

		An implementation MAY have a transition mode where it includes the 
		Authentication Trailer in the packets but does not verify this information.

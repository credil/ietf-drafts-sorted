   Abstract 

      Currently a few routing protocols use IPSec for authenticating 
      their protocol packets. There are known issues with using IPSec 
      with the routing protocols and this draft proposes an 
      alternative Generic Authentication mechanism that can be used so 
      that these protocols do not depend upon IPSec for security. The 
      mechanism introduced in this draft is generic and can be used by 
      any protocol that currently uses IPSec for authentication. 

      While this mechanism is generic, this draft specifically looks 
      at OSPFv3 and how it can use the mechanism described herein.

   1. Introduction 

      Routing protocols like Open Shortest Path First Version 3 
      (OSPFv3) and Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode (PIM-
      SIM) (for the link-local messages) use IPSec [RFC4301] to ensure 
      authentication of their control packets.

      There however are some environments (mobile ad-hoc), where IPSec 
      is difficult to configure and maintain, and this mechanism 
      cannot be used.  
       
      The anti-replay feature available in both Authentication Header 
      (AH) [RFC4302] and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) 
      [RFC4303] is disabled by the receiver for a manually keyed 
      Security Association (SA). This means that the Anti-Replay 
      Window as described in [RFC4301] is completely ignored when 
      receiving IPSec packets. 
       
      Since routing protocols mostly use manually keyed SAs, they 
      cannot make use of the Anti-Reply feature provided by IPSec. 
      This makes the protocols vulnerable to replay attacks. 
       
      Routing protocols need IPSec for data integrity and rarely 
      employ it for confidentiality, therefore most specifications 
      [RFC4552] [RFC5796] that describe how routing protocols need to 
      use IPSec for security mandate using ESP-NULL. 
       
      So while the routing protocols could be using ESP-NULL, which 
      means that routing packets are being sent in clear, there is no 
      deterministic way to differentiate between encrypted and 
      unencrypted ESP packets by simply examining the packet. This can 
      pose some challenge to a device that wants to prioritize certain 
      control traffic over the other. IP Security Maintenance and 
      Extensions (IPSecME) Working group has documented two approaches 
      to enable intermediate security devices to distinguish between 
      encrypted and unencrypted ESP traffic - Wrapped Encapsulating 
      Security Payload (WESP) [RFC5840] and the heuristics approach 
      [RFC5879].  
       
      While this issue of traffic prioritization on the receiving 
      nodes can be solved by employing certain implementation tricks, 
      it is an issue that should get addressed. 
       
      This draft provides a generic mechanism that routing protocols 
      can use for data integrity verification while fixing the above 
      stated issues. 
       
   1.1. OSPFv3 

      Unlike OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) Version 2 [RFC2328] OSPF 
      for IPv6 (OSPFv3) [RFC5340], does not have Auth Type and 
      Authentication fields in its headers for authenticating the 
      protocol packets. It instead relies on the IPv6 Authentication 
      Header (AH) [RFC4302] and IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload 
      (ESP) [RFC4303] to provide integrity, authentication, and/or 
      confidentiality.

   Internet-Draft                                       September 2010 
       

       
      [RFC4552] describes how IPv6 AH/ESP extension headers can be 
      used to provide authentication/confidentiality to OSPFv3. 
       
      [RFC4552] discusses, at length, the reasoning behind using 
      manually configured keys, rather than some automated key 
      management protocol such as IKEv2 [RFC5996]. The primary problem 
      is the lack of suitable key management mechanism, as OSPF 
      adjacencies are formed on a one-to-many basis and most key 
      management mechanisms are designed for a one-to-one 
      communication model. This forces the system administrator to use 
      manually configured security associations (SAs) and 
      cryptographic keys to provide the authentication and, if 
      desired, confidentiality services. 
       
      Regarding replay protection [RFC4552] states that: 
       
         As it is not possible as per the current standards to provide 
         complete replay protection while using manual keying, the  
         proposed solution will not provide protection against replay  
         attacks. 
       
      Since there is no replay protection provided there are a number 
      of vulnerabilities in OSPFv3 which have been discussed in 
      [crypto-issues]. 
       
      These can be fixed if we move to a non IPSec method for 
      authenticating the OSPFv3 protocol packets. 
       
      Lastly, there is also an issue with using IPSec for 
      authenticating OSPFv3 packets where prioritizing certain 
      protocol packets over the others becomes difficult.  
       
      This draft proposes a new mechanism that works similar to OSPFv2 
      for providing authentication to the OSPFv3 packets and attempts 
      to solve the problems described above for OSPFv3. 
       
      Additionally this document describes how HMAC-SHA authentication 
      can be used for OSPFv3. 
       
      By definition, HMAC ([RFC2104], [FIPS-198]) requires a 
      cryptographic hash function. This document proposes to use any 
      one of SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 [FIPS-180-3] to 
      authenticate the OSPFv3 packets. 
       
      It is believed that [RFC2104] is mathematically identical to 
      [FIPS-198] and it is also believed that algorithms in [RFC4634] 
      are mathematically identical to [FIPS-180-3].

   2. Basic Operation 

      In order to provide authentication for OSPFv3 packets, 
      implementations MUST support the Generic Authentication 
      extension header described in the subsequent sections. 
       
      This will only be used to provide data integrity and cannot be 
      used for confidentiality. If the latter is required then 
      implementations MUST use ESP as described in [RFC4552]. 
       
      Using this authentication scheme, a session key (either 
      statically configured or derived from some master key) is used 
      on all the routers attached to a common network. For each OSPFv3 
      protocol packet, this key is used to generate and verify a 
      "message digest". This digest is carried inside the Generic 
      Authentication extension header. The message digest is a one-way 
      function of the OSPFv3 protocol packet and the secret key. Since 
      the secret key is never sent over the network in the clear, 
      protection is provided against passive attacks [RFC1704]. 
       
      The algorithms used to generate and verify the digest are 
      specified implicitly by the key. In addition, a non decreasing 
      sequence number is included in the Generic Authentication Header 
      carried along with each OSPFv3 protocol packet to protect 
      against replay attacks. 
       
       
   3. OSPFv3 Security Association 

      An OSPFv3 Security Association contains a set of parameters 
      shared between any two legitimate OSPFv3 speakers.  
       
      Parameters associated with an OSPFv3 SA: 
       
      Key Identifier (Key ID) 
       
      This is a 32-bit unsigned integer used to uniquely identify an 
      OSPFV3 SA, as manually configured by the network operator.  
       
      The receiver determines the active SA by looking at the Key ID 
      field in the incoming protocol packet.  
       
      The sender based on the active configuration, selects the 
      Security Association to use and puts the correct Key ID value 
      associated with the Security Association in the OSPFV3 protocol 
      packet. If multiple valid and active OSPFV3 Security 
      Associations exist for a given outbound interface at the time an 
      OSPFV3 packet is sent, the sender may use any of those security 
      associations to protect the packet.

      Using Key IDs makes changing keys while maintaining protocol 
      operation convenient. Each key ID specifies two independent 
      parts, the authentication protocol and the authentication key, 
      as explained below.  
       
      Normally, an implementation would allow the network operator to 
      configure a set of keys in a key chain, with each key in the 
      chain having fixed lifetime. The actual operation of these 
      mechanisms is outside the scope of this document. 
       
      Note that each key ID can indicate a key with a different 
      authentication protocol. This allows multiple authentication 
      mechanisms to be used at various times without disrupting an  
      OSPFv3 peering, including the introduction of new authentication 
      mechanisms. 
       
      Authentication Algorithm 
       
      This signifies the authentication algorithm to be used with the 
      OSPFv3 SA. This information is never sent in cleartext over the 
      wire. Because this information is not sent on the wire, the 
      implementer chooses an implementation specific representation 
      for this information.  
       
      At present, the following values are possible:  
       
      HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-512. 
       
      Authentication Key 
       
      This value denotes the cryptographic authentication key 
      associated with the OSPFv3 SA. The length of this key is 
      variable and depends upon the authentication algorithm specified 
      by the OSPFv3 SA.  
       
       
   4. Authentication Procedure 

   4.1. Generic Authentication Header 

      The Generic Authentication Header uses the Next_Header (TBD via 
      IANA) in the immediately preceding header, and has the following 
      format:

      32-bit non-decreasing sequence number that is used to guard 
      against replay attacks. This provides a long term protection 
      however it is still possible to replay packets using this 
      mechanism until the sequence number changes. This field is 
      initialized to zero and is also set to zero whenever the 
      originating router state is transitioned to "Down" state. 
      Whenever a protocol packet carrying this extension header is 
      accepted as authentic, the receiving router, must update the 
      cryptographic sequence number that it maintains for the 
      originating router to the received packet's sequence number. 
       
      This specification does not provide a rollover procedure for  
      the cryptographic sequence number. When the cryptographic  
      sequence number that the router is sending hits the maximum  
      value, the router should reset the cryptographic sequence number  
      that it is sending back to 0. After this is done, the router's  
      neighbors will reject the router's protocol packets for some 
      period till the protocol employing the use of generic 
      authentication times out and tries reestablishing the 
      adjacencies. In case of OSPFv3 this period would be the 
      RouterDeadInterval. However, it is expected that most 
      implementations will use "seconds since reboot" (or "seconds 
      since 1960", etc.) as the cryptographic sequence number. Such 
      a choice will essentially prevent rollover, since the 
      cryptographic sequence number field is 32 bits in length. 
       
      A protocol that wants to use the Generic Extension header MAY 
      not use the Anti-Replay feature if it does not require it. In 
      such cases this field MUST be set to zero and MUST be ignored by 
      the receiving router. 
       
      Authentication Data 
       
      Variable data that is carrying the digest of the protocol 
      packet. 
       
      Padding 
       
      This MUST be used with IPv6 in order to preserve IPv6 8-octet 
      alignment. If HMAC-SHA-1 is being used as the authentication 
      algorithm then the authentication data is of 20 bytes. Add to 
      this 1 byte of the next header, 1 byte of the header length, the 
      2 reserved bytes, 4 bytes for the cryptographic sequence number 
      and 4 bytes of the Key ID and we get 32 bytes. Since this is 
      already aligned to an 8 octet boundary no padding is required. 
      However, if the authentication algorithm is HMAC-SHA-256 then 
      the total size comes to 44 bytes, which is not aligned. In this

   4.2. Cryptographic Authentication Procedure 

      As noted earlier the algorithms used to generate and verify the 
      message digest are specified implicitly by the secret key. This 
      specification discusses the computation of Cryptographic 
      Authentication data when any of the NIST SHS family of 
      algorithms is used in the Hashed Message Authentication Code 
      (HMAC) mode.  
       
      The currently valid algorithms (including mode) for 
      Cryptographic Authentication include: 
                  
                 HMAC-SHA-1               
                 HMAC-SHA-256             
                 HMAC-SHA-384             
                 HMAC-SHA-512             
       
      Of the above, implementations of this specification MUST include 
      support for at least: 
       
             HMAC-SHA-256 
       
      and SHOULD include support for: 
       
             HMAC-SHA-1 
       
      and MAY also include support for: 
       
             HMAC-SHA-384 
             HMAC-SHA-512

   4.3. Cryptographic Aspects 

      In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, 
      which is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used: 
       
      H is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-256). 
       
      K is the Authentication Key for the routing protocol (OSPFv3 in 
      this case) security association. 
        
      Ko is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm. 
       
      B is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits. 
       
      Note that B is the internal block size, not the hash size. 
       
           For SHA-1 and SHA-256:   B == 64 
           For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128 
       
      L is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than 
      bits. 
       
      XOR is the exclusive-or operation. 
      Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times. 
      Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times. 
      Apad is the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times. 
       
      Implementation Note: 
       
      This definition of Apad means that Apad is always the same 
      length  
      as the hash output. 
       
      (1)Preparation of the Key 
    
         In this application, Ko is always L octets long. 
       
         If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is  
         equal to K.  If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L  
         octets long, then Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication  
         Key (K) is less than L octets long, then Ko is set to the  
         Authentication Key (K) with zeros appended to the end of the  
         Authentication Key (K) such that Ko is L octets long. 
       
      (2)First Hash 
       
         First, the protocol packet's Generic Authentication Extension 
         Header Data field is filled with the value Apad.

         Then, a first hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed 
         as follows: 
       
                 First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (Protocol Packet)) 
       
      (3)Second Hash 
       
         Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is  
         computed as follows: 
       
                 Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash) 
       
      (4)Result 
       
         The result Second-Hash becomes the authentication data that 
         is sent in the Authentication Data field of the Generic  
         Authentication extension header. The length of the  
         authentication data is always identical to the message  
         digest size of the specific hash function H that is being  
         used. 
       
         This also means that the use of hash functions with larger  
         output sizes will also increase the size of the protocol 
         packet as transmitted on the wire. 
       
   4.4. Procedures at the Sending Side for OSPFv3 

      An appropriate OSPFv3 SA is selected for use with an outgoing  
      OSPFv3 protocol packet. This is done based on the active key at  
      that instant. If OSPFV3 is unable to find an active key, then  
      the packet MUST be discarded.  
       
      If OSPFV3 is able to find the active key, then the key gives the 
      authentication algorithm (HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384  
      or HMAC-SHA-512) that needs to be applied on the packet. 
       
      An implementation MUST construct a pseudo Generic Authentication 
      extension header before it begins the authentication process. It 
      must set the Next Header to 89, to indicate an OSPF packet (or  
      some other value if the Upper layer protocol is something else). 
      The authentication data is computed as explained in the previous 
      section.  
       
      The Header length is set as per the authentication algorithm 
      that is being used. It is, for example, set to 3 for  
      HMAC-SHA-1 and 5 for HMAC-SHA-256.

      The key ID and the cryptographic sequence number is filled. 
      Appropriate padding, based on the authentication algorithm being 
      employed, must be used. 
       
      The result of the authentication algorithm is placed in the 
      Authentication data. 
       
   4.5. Procedures at the Receiving Side for OSPFv3 

      The appropriate OSPFv3 SA is identified by looking at the Key ID 
      from the Generic Authentication extension header from the 
      incoming OSPFv3 protocol packet. 
       
      Using the RouterID carried in the OSPFv3 header, the correct 
      sending neighbor MUST be identified. If a cryptographic sequence 
      number is found in the Generic Extension Header and is less than 
      the cryptographic sequence number recorded in the sending 
      neighbor's data structure, that OSPFv3 packet MUST be discarded. 
      Implementations MAY want to log this event. 
       
      Authentication algorithm dependent processing needs to be  
      performed, using the algorithm specified by the appropriate  
      OSPFv3 SA for the received packet. 
       
      Before an implementation performs any processing it needs to 
      save the values of the Authentication Value field in the Generic 
      Authentication extension header. 
       
      It should then set the Authentication Value field with Apad 
      before the authentication data is computed. The calculated data 
      is compared with the received authentication data in the packet 
      and the packet is discarded if the two do not match. In such a 
      case, an error event SHOULD be logged. 
       
       
   5. Generic Authentication Mechanism    

      The extension header described in this document can be used by 
      any upper layer protocol that desires integrity protection. All 
      it needs to do is to compute the digest over that protocol 
      packet and carry it inside the Generic Authentication extension 
      header as described in this document. 
       
   6. Security Considerations 

      The document proposes extensions to OSPFv3 which would make it 
      more secure than what it is today. It does not provide 
      confidentiality as a routing protocol contains information  

   Bhatia, Manav             Expires March 2011              [Page 12]

      that does not need to be kept secret. It does, however, provide 
      means to authenticate the sender of the packets which is of 
      interest to us. 
       
      It should be noted that authentication method described in this 
      document is not being used to authenticate the specific 
      originator of a packet, but is rather being used to confirm that 
      the packet has indeed been issued by a router which had access 
      to the password. 
       
      The mechanism described here is not perfect and does not need to 
      be perfect. Instead, this mechanism represents a significant 
      increase in the work function of an adversary attacking the 
      OSPFv3 protocol, while not causing undue implementation, 
      deployment, or operational complexity. 
       
   7. IANA Considerations 

      The Generic Authentication extension header number is assigned 
      by IANA out of the IP Protocol Number space (and as recorded at 
      the IANA web page at  
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers) is: TBD.

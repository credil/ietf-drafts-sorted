              Supporting Authentication Trailer for OSPFv3
               draft-bhatia-manral-auth-trailer-ospfv3-01

Abstract

   Currently OSPFv3 uses IPsec for authenticating protocol packets.
   However, there are some environments, e.g., Mobile Ad-hoc Networks
   (MANETs), where IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and
   this mechanism cannot be used.  This draft proposes an alternative
   mechanism that can be used so that OSPFv3 does not depend upon IPsec
   for authentication.

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3            October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Unlike Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) [RFC2328], OSPF
   for IPv6 (OSPFv3) [RFC5340], does not include the AuType and
   Authentication fields in its headers for authenticating protocol
   packets.  Instead, OSPFv3 relies on the IPv6 Authentication Header
   (AH)[RFC4302] and IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303]
   to provide integrity, authentication, and/or confidentiality.

   [RFC4522] describes how IPv6 AH and ESP extension headers can be used
   to provide authentication and/or confidentiality to OSPFv3.

   However, there are some environments, e.g., Mobile Ad-hoc Networks
   (MANETs), where IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and
   this mechanism cannot be used.  There is also an issue with IPsec not
   being available on some platforms or it requiring an additional
   license.

   [RFC4522] discusses, at length, the reasoning behind using manually
   configured keys, rather than some automated key management protocol
   such as IKEv2 [RFC5996] .  The primary problem is the lack of
   suitable key management mechanism, as OSPF adjacencies are formed on
   a one-to-many basis and most key management mechanisms are designed
   for a one-to-one communication model.  This forces the system
   administrator to use manually configured security associations (SAs)
   and cryptographic keys to provide the authentication and, if desired,
   confidentiality services.

   Regarding replay protection [RFC4522] states that:

   "As it is not possible as per the current standards to provide
   complete replay protection while using manual keying, the proposed
   solution will not provide protection against replay attacks."

   Since there is no replay protection provided there are a number of
   vulnerabilities in OSPFv3 which have been discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-opsec-routing-protocols-crypto-issues].

   Since there is no deterministic way to differentiate between
   encrypted and unencrypted ESP packets by simply examining the packet,
   it could become tricky for some implementations to prioritize certain
   OSPFv3 packets (Hellos for example) over the others.

   This draft proposes a new mechanism that works similar to OSPFv2
   [RFC5709]for providing authentication to the OSPFv3 packets and
   attempts to solve the problems described above for OSPFv3.

   Additionally this document describes how HMAC-SHA authentication can



Bhatia, et al.           Expires April 18, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3            October 2010


   be used for OSPFv3.

   By definition, HMAC ([RFC2104] , [FIPS-198]) requires a cryptographic
   hash function.  This document proposes to use any one of SHA-1, SHA-
   256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 [FIPS-180-3] to authenticate the OSPFv3
   packets.

   It is believed that [RFC2104] is mathematically identical to
   [FIPS-198] and it is also believed that algorithms in [RFC4634] are
   mathematically identical to [FIPS-180-3].

2.  Proposed Solution

   To perform non-IPsec cryptographic authentication, OSPFv3 routers
   append a special data block, henceforth referred to as, the
   authentication trailer to the end of the OSPFv3 packets.  The length
   of the authentication trailer is not included into the length of the
   OSPFv3 packet, but is included in the IPv6 payload length.

                Figure 1: Authentication Trailer in OSPFv3

   For the sake of consistency and simplicity the authentication trailer
   in the OSPFv3 packets MUST be inserted before the link local
   signalling (LLS) [RFC5613] block, if it exists.  This is inline with
   the authentication mechanism that currently exists for OSPFv2.

2.1.  AT-Bit in Options Field

   A new AT-bit (AT stands for Authentication Trailer) is introduced
   into the OSPFv3 Options field.  OSPFv3 routers MUST set the AT-bit in
   OSPFv3 Hello and Database Description packets to indicate that the
   OSPFv3 router will include the authentication trailer in all OSPFv3
   packets on the link.  In other words, the authentication trailer is
   only examined if the AT-bit is set.

   The AT-bit must be set in all OSPFv3 protocol packets that contain an
   authentication trailer.

2.2.  Basic Operation

   The procedure followed for computing the Authentication Trailer is
   exactly the same as described in [RFC5709] and [RFC2328].

   The way the authentication data is carried in the Authentication
   Trailer is very similar to how its done in case of [RFC2328].  The
   only difference between this mechanism and OSPFv2's authentication
   mechanism is that for OSPFv3 some additional authentication
   information in addition to the message digest, is appended to the
   protocol packet.

3.  OSPFv3 Security Association

   An OSPFv3 Security Association (SA) contains a set of parameters
   shared between any two legitimate OSPFv3 speakers.

   Parameters associated with an OSPFv3 SA:

   o  Key Identifier (Key ID)

      This is a 32-bit unsigned integer used to uniquely identify an
      OSPFv3 SA, as manually configured by the network operator.

      The receiver determines the active SA by looking at the Key ID
      field in the incoming protocol packet.

      The sender based on the active configuration, selects an SA to use
      and puts the correct Key ID value associated with the SA in the
      OSPFV3 protocol packet.  If multiple valid and active OSPFv3 SAs
      exist for a given interface, the sender may use any of those SAs
      to protect the packet.

      Using Key IDs makes changing keys while maintaining protocol
      operation convenient.  Each key ID specifies two independent
      parts, the authentication protocol and the authentication key, as
      explained below.

      Normally, an implementation would allow the network operator to
      configure a set of keys in a key chain, with each key in the chain
      having fixed lifetime.  The actual operation of these mechanisms
      is outside the scope of this document.

      Note that each key ID can indicate a key with a different
      authentication protocol.  This allows the introduction of new
      authentication mechanisms without disrupting existing OSPFv3
      adjacencies.

   o  Authentication Algorithm

      This signifies the authentication algorithm to be used with the
      OSPFv3 SA.  This information is never sent in cleartext over the
      wire.  Because this information is not sent on the wire, the
      implementer chooses an implementation specific representation for
      this information.

      At present, the following values are possible:

      HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512.

   o  Authentication Key

      This value denotes the cryptographic authentication key associated
      with the OSPFv3 SA.  The length of this key is variable and
      depends upon the authentication algorithm specified by the OSPFv3
      SA.

4.1.  Authentication Trailer

   The authentication trailer that is appended to the OSPFv3 protocol
   packet is described below:

                  Figure 3: Authentication Trailer Format

   The idea is to keep the fields as similar as possible with OSPFv2 so
   that most of the source code can be reused for authenticating the
   OSPFv3 protocol packets.

   The various fields in the Authentication trailer are:

   o  Reserved

      16-bit reserved field.  The value MUST be initialized to zero by
      the sender, and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   o  Key ID (Identifier)

      32-bit field that identifies the algorithm and the secret key used
      to create the message digest appended to the OSPFv3 protocol
      packet.  Key Identifiers are unique per-interface.

   o  Cryptographic Sequence Number

      32-bit non-decreasing sequence number that is used to guard
      against replay attacks.

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3            October 2010


   o  Authentication Data

      Variable data that is carrying the digest of the protocol packet.

4.2.  Cryptographic Authentication Procedure

   As noted earlier the algorithms used to generate and verify the
   message digest are specified implicitly by the secret key.  This
   specification discusses the computation of OSPFv3 Cryptographic
   Authentication data when any of the NIST SHS family of algorithms is
   used in the Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) mode.

   The currently valid algorithms (including mode) for OSPFv3
   Cryptographic Authentication include:

   HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-512

   Of the above, implementations of this specification MUST include
   support for at least HMAC-SHA-1 and SHOULD include support for HMAC-
   SHA-256 and MAY also include support for HMAC-SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-
   512.

4.3.  Cryptographic Aspects

   In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, which
   is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used:

   H is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g.  SHA-256).

   K is the Authentication Key for the OSPFv3 security association.

   Ko is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm.

   B is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits.

   Note that B is the internal block size, not the hash size.

      For SHA-1 and SHA-256: B == 64

      For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128

   L is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than bits.

   XOR is the exclusive-or operation.

   Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times.

   Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times.

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3            October 2010


   Apad is the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times.

   Implementation Note:

   This definition of Apad means that Apad is always the same length as
   the hash output.

   1.  Preparation of the Key

       In this application, Ko is always L octets long.

       If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is equal
       to K. If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L octets long,
       then Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication Key (K) is less
       than L octets long, then Ko is set to the Authentication Key (K)
       with zeros appended to the end of the Authentication Key (K) such
       that Ko is L octets long.

   2.  First Hash

       First, the OSPFv3 packet's Authentication Trailer (which is very
       similar to the appendage described in RFC 2328, Section D.4.3,
       Page 233, items(6)(a) and (6)(d)) is filled with the value Apad.

       Then, a First-Hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed as
       follows:

          First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (OSPFv3 Packet))

       Implementation Notes:

          Note that the First-Hash above includes the Authentication
          Trailer containing the Apad value, as well as the OSPFv3
          packet, as per RFC 2328, Section D.4.3.

       The definition of Apad (above) ensures it is always the same
       length as the hash output.  This is consistent with RFC 2328.
       The "(OSPFv3 Packet)" mentioned in the First-Hash (above) does
       include the OSPF Authentication Trailer.

       The digest length for SHA-1 is 20 bytes; for SHA-256, 32 bytes;
       for SHA-384, 48 bytes; and for SHA-512, 64 bytes.

   3.  Second Hash

       Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is computed as

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3            October 2010


          Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash)

   4.  Result

       The resulting Second-Hash becomes the authentication data that is
       sent in the Authentication Trailer of the OSPFv3 packet.  The
       length of the authentication data is always identical to the
       message digest size of the specific hash function H that is being
       used.

       This also means that the use of hash functions with larger output
       sizes will also increase the size of the OSPFv3 packet as
       transmitted on the wire.

       Implementation Note:

          RFC 2328, Appendix D specifies that the Authentication Trailer
          is not counted in the OSPF packet's own Length field, but is
          included in the packet's IP Length field.  Similar to this,
          the Authentication Trailer is not included in OSPFv3's own
          Length field, but is included in IPv6's payload length.

4.4.  Message Verification

   A router would determine that OSPFv3 is using an Authentication
   trailer by examining the AT-bit in the Options field in the OSPFv3
   header for Hello and Database Description packets.  The specification
   in the Hello and Database description options indicates that other
   OSPFv3 packets will include the authentication trailer.

   Authentication algorithm dependent processing needs to be performed,
   using the algorithm specified by the appropriate OSPFv3 SA for the
   received packet.

   Before an implementation performs any processing it needs to save the
   values of the Authentication data field from the Authentication
   Trailer appended to the OSPFv3 packet.

   It should then set the Authentication data field with Apad before the
   authentication data is computed.  The calculated data is compared
   with the received authentication data in the Authentication trailer
   and the packet MUST be discarded if the two do not match.  In such a
   case, an error event SHOULD be logged.

   An implementation MAY have a transition mode where it includes the
   Authentication Trailer in the packets but does not verify this
   information.  This is provided as a transition aid for networks in
   the process of migrating to the mechanism described in this draft.

5.  Security Considerations

   The document proposes extensions to OSPFv3 which would make it more
   secure than what it is today.  It does not provide confidentiality as
   a routing protocol contains information that does not need to be kept
   secret.  It does, however, provide means to authenticate the sender
   of the packets which is of interest to us.

   It should be noted that authentication method described in this
   document is not being used to authenticate the specific originator of
   a packet, but is rather being used to confirm that the packet has
   indeed been issued by a router which had access to the password.

   The mechanism described here is not perfect and does not need to be
   perfect.  Instead, this mechanism represents a significant increase
   in the work function of an adversary attacking the OSPFv3 protocol,
   while not causing undue implementation, deployment, or operational
   complexity.

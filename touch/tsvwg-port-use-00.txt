1. Introduction

   (TBD)

2. History

   The term 'port' was first used in RFC33 to describe a simplex
   communication path from a process. At a meeting described in RFC37,
   an idea was presented to decouple connections between processes and
   links that they use as paths, and thus to include source and
   destination socket identifiers in packets. RFC38 explains this in
   detail, in which processes might have more than one of these paths,
   and that more than one may be active at a time. As a result, there
   was the need to add a process identifier to the header of each
   message, so that the incoming data could be demultiplexed to the

   appropriate process. RFC38 further suggested that 32 bits would be
   used for these identifiers. RFC48 discusses the current notion of
   listening on a given port, but does not discuss how the issue of
   port determination. RFC61 notes that the challenge of knowing the
   appropriate port numbers is "left to the processes" in general, but
   introduces the concept of a "well-known" port for common services.

   RFC76 addresses this issue more constructively, proposing a
   "telephone book" by which an index would allow ports to be used by
   name, but still assumes that both source and destination ports are
   fixed by such a system. RFC333 suggests that the port pair, rather
   than an individual port, would be used on both sides of the
   connection for demultiplexing messages. This is the final view in
   RFC793 (and its predecessors, including IEN 112), and brings us to
   their current meaning. RFC739 introduces the notion of generic
   reserved ports, used for groups of protocols, such as "any private
   RJE server". Although the overall range of such ports was (and
   remains) 16 bits, only the first 256 (high 8 bits cleared) in the
   range were considered assigned.

   RFC758 is the first to describe a list of such well-known ports, as
   well as describing ranges used for different purposes:

      Binary    Octal

      -----------------------------------------------------------

      0-63      0-77      Network Wide Standard Function

      64-127    100-177   Hosts Specific Functions

      128-223   200-337   Reserved for Future Use

      224-255   340-377   Any Experimental Function

   In RFC820, those range meanings disappeared, and a single list of
   assignments is presented. By RFC900, they appeared as decimal
   numbers rather than the octal ranges used previously. RFC1340
   increased this range from 0..255 to 0..1023, and began to list TCP
   and UDP port assignments individually (although the assumption was,
   and remains, that once assigned a port applies to all transport
   protocols, including TCP, UDP, recently SCTP and DCCP, as well as
   ISO-TP4 for a brief period in the early 1990s). RFC1340 also
   established the Registered space of 1024-59151, though it notes that
   it is not controlled by the IANA at that point. The list provided by
   RFC1700 in 1994 remained the standard until it was declared replaced
   by an on-line version, as of RFC3232 in 2002.

3. Current Port Use

   The current IANA website (www.iana.org) indicates three ranges of
   port assignments:

      Binary         Hex

      -----------------------------------------------------------

      0-1023         0x03FF         Well-Known (a.k.a. 'system')

      1024-49151     0x0300-0xBFFF  Registered (a.k.a. 'user')

      49152-65535    0xC000-0xFFFF  Dynamic/Private

   Well-known encompasses the range 0..1023. On some systems, use of
   these ports requires privileged access, e.g., that the process run
   as 'root', which is why these are referred to as 'system' ports. The
   ports from 1024..49151 denotes non-privileged services, known as
   'registered'; because these ports do not run with special
   privileges, they are often referred to as 'user' ports. Dynamic or
   Private ports are not registered through IANA.

   Both Well-Known and Registered ports are registered through IANA, so
   both are sometimes called "registered ports". As a result, the term
   'registered' is ambiguous, referring either to the entire range 0-
   49151 or to the user ports. Complicating matters further, 'system'
   ports do not always require special (i.e., 'root') privilege.
   Regardless, for clarity, throughout the remainder of this document
   we will refer to the port ranges as 'system', 'user', and 'private'.

4. What is a Port?

   A port is a 16-bit number used for two distinct purposes:

      o  Demultiplexing transport connections within an end host

      o  Identifying a service

   The first reason requires that each transport connection between a
   given pair of IP addresses use a different pair of ports, but does
   not require either coordination or registration of port use. It is
   the second reason that drives the need for a common registry.

   Consider a user wanting to run a web server. That service could run
   on any port, provided that all clients knew what port to use to



Touch                    Expires June 3, 2011                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  Recommendations for Transport Port Use    December 2010


   access that service at that host. Such information can be
   distributed out of band, e.g., in the URL, such as:

      http:51509//www.example.com/

   Ultimately, it's important to keep in mind that the correlation of a
   service with a port number is an agreement between the two endpoints
   of the connection only. The rest of the world might think that
   you're sending DNS packets on port 53, but you can run a web server
   on that port just fine, provided the server and client both decide
   that port 53 is for HTTP web server traffic.

   Which brings us to the concept of a service. A service is the
   combination of ISO Layers 5-7 that represent an application protocol
   capability. For example www (port 80) is a service that uses HTTP as
   an application protocol, and provides a common web server. However,
   it is possible to use HTTP for other purposes, such as command and
   control. This is why some current service names (HTTP, e.g.) are a
   bit overloaded - they describe not only the application protocol,
   but a particular service.

   IANA registers ports so that endpoints on the Internet do not need
   to pairwise, explicitly coordinate the meaning of their port
   numbers. This is the primary reason for registering ports with IANA
   - to have a common agreement between all endpoints on the Internet
   as to the meaning of a port.

   Ports are used for other purposes as well, however. The other
   primary reason for registering ports with IANA is to simplify end
   system configuration, so individual installations do not need to
   coordinate their use of arbitrary ports. A similar reason is to
   simplify firewall management, so that a single, fixed firewall
   configuration can either permit or deny a service.

5. Conservation

   (statistics of port allocations)

   Ways to conserve, e.g., use service names (DNS SRV, TCP portnames,
   etc.), use portmapper, Bonjour, or other services for demuxing

6. How to Use Registered Ports

6.1. Do You Need a Port?

   How to carefully use experimental ports (include a large nonce)

Internet-Draft  Recommendations for Transport Port Use    December 2010


   Reasons NOT to register a port, e.g., not for a copy of an existing
   service,

   Reasons why only server ports are registered (not client)

6.2. How Many Ports?

   Reasons NOT to have multiple ports (performance, etc.)

   Techniques to reduce port use:

      o  When can you use a discovery service

      o  When can you use multiplexing

      o  When can you use handoff with in-band IDs

6.3. Support for Security

   Why this is generally expected

   Why this should/should not use a separate port

   TLS allows optional security

6.4. Support for Future Versions

   Reasons NOT to include the version number in the name

6.5. Transport Protocols

   UDP vs. TCP vs. others

   When/why you need multiples

   When UDP is -disc

6.6. When to Register

   What range to use before registering

   When are you ready to register (basically when you have enough
   information to fill out the application)

   Reasons NOT to squat

6.7. Other Considerations

   Higher bar for system ports

   Changing a name

   Providing enough information for IANA review, e.g., to avoid
   Internet congestion, fit in MTUs, deal with reordering, etc.

   Relation of this doc to the IANA Port Experts review process (this
   is just a summary from the user/designer viewpoint, and is NOT
   binding to IANA or its Expert Review team)

7. Recommendations for Future Allocation

   Abolish the distinction of system ports? BIG QUESTION HERE...

8. Security Considerations

   This document discusses ways to conserve port numbers, notably
   through encouraging demultiplexing within a single port.  As such,
   there may be cases where two variants of a protocol - insecure and
   secure, are suggested to share the same port (e.g., HTTP and HTTPS,
   though currently those are assigned different ports).

   This document reminds protocol designers that port numbers are not a
   substitute for security, and should not alone be used to avoid
   denial of service or firewall traffic, notably because their use is
   not regulated or authenticated.

9. IANA Considerations

   The entirety of this document focuses on IANA issues, notably
   suggestions that help ensure the conservation of port numbers and
   provide useful hints for issuing informative requests thereof.

Abstract

   The Initial Window (IW) provides the starting point for TCP's
   feedback-based congestion control algorithm. Its value has increased
   over time to increase performance and to reflect increased
   capability of Internet devices. This document describes a mechanism
   to adjust the IW over long timescales, to make future changes more
   safely deployed and to potentially avoid reexamination of this value
   in the future.

1. Introduction

   TCP's congestion control algorithm uses an initial window value
   (IW), both as a starting point for new connections and after one RTO
   or more [RFC2581][RFC2861]. This value has evolved over time,
   originally one maximum segment size (MSS), and increased to the
   lesser of four MSS or 4,380 bytes [RFC3390][RFC5681]. For typical
   Internet connections with an maximum transmission units (MTUs) of
   1500 bytes, this permits three segments of 1,460 bytes each.

   The IW value was originally implied in the original TCP congestion
   control description, and documented as a standard in 1997
   [RFC2001][Ja88]. The value was last updated in 1998 experimentally,
   and moved to the standards track in 2002 [RFC2414][RFC3390]. There
   have been recent proposals to update the IW based on further
   increases in host and router capabilities and network capacity, some

   focusing on specific values (e.g., IW=10), and others prescribing a
   schedule for increases over time (e.g., IW=6 for 2011, increasing by
   1-2 MSS per year).

   This document proposes that TCP can objectively measure when an IW
   is too large, and that such feedback should be used over long
   timescales to adjust the IW automatically. The result should be
   safer to deploy and might avoid the need to repeatedly revisit IW
   size over time.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words
   listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying
   or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC.

3. Design Considerations

   TCP's IW value has existed statically for over two decades, so any
   solution to adjusting the IW dynamically should have similarly
   stable, non-invasive effects on the performance and complexity of
   TCP. In order to be fair, the IW should be similar for most machines
   on the public Internet. Finally, a desirable goal is to develop a
   self-correcting algorithm, so that IW values that cause network
   problems can be avoided. To that end, we propose the following list
   of design goals:

   o  Impart little to no impact to TCP in the absence of loss, i.e.,
      it should not increase the complexity of default packet
      processing in the normal case.

   o  Adapt to network feedback over long timescales, avoiding values
      that persistently cause network problems.

   o  Decrease the IW in the presence of sustained loss of IW segments,
      as determined over a number of different connections.

   o  Increase the IW in the absence of sustained loss of IW segments,
      as determined over a number of different connections.

   o  Operate conservatively, i.e., tend towards leaving the IW the
      same in the absence of sufficient information, and give greater
      consideration to IW segment loss than IW segment success.

   We expect that, without other context, a good IW algorithm will
   converge to a single value, but this is not required. An endpoint
   with additional context or information, or deployed in a constrained
   environment, can always use a different value. In specific,
   information from previous connections, or sets of connections with a
   similar path, can already be used as context for such decisions
   [RFC2140].

   However, if a given IW value persistently causes packet loss during
   the initial burst of packets, it is clearly inappropriate and could
   be inducing unnecessary loss in other competing connections. This
   might happen for sites behind very slow boxes with small buffers,
   which may or may not be the first hop.

4. Proposed IW Algorithm

   Below is a simple description of the proposed IW algorithm. It
   relies on the following parameters:

   o  MinIW = 3 MSS or 4,380 bytes (as per RFC3390]

   o  MaxIW = 10

   o  MulDecr = 0.5

   o  AddIncr = 2 MSS

   o  Threshold = 0.05

   We assume that the minimum IW (MinIW) should be as currently
   specified [RFC3390]. The maximum IW can be set to a fixed value
   [Ch10], or set based on a schedule if trusted time references are
   available [Al10]; here we prefer a fixed value. We also propose to
   use an AIMD algorithm, with increase and decreases as noted.

   Although these parameters are somewhat arbitrary, their initial
   values are not important except that the algorithm is AIMD and the
   MaxIW should not exceed that recommended for other systems on the
   Internet. Current proposals, including default current operation,
   are degenerate cases of the algorithm below for given parameters -

   notably MulDec = 1.0 and AddIncr = 0 MSS, thus disabling the
   automatic part of the algorithm.

   The proposed algorithm is as follows:

   0. On boot:

      IW = MaxIW; # assume this is in bytes, and an even number of MSS

   1. Upon starting a new connection

      CWND = IW;
      conncount++;
      IWnotchecked = 1; # true

   2. During a connection's SYN-ACK processing, if SYN-ACK includes
      ECN, treat as if the IW is too large

      if (IWnotchecked && (synackecn == 1)) {
         losscount++;
         IWnotchecked = 0; # never check again
      }

   3. During a connection, if retransmission occurs, check the seqno of
      the outgoing packet (in bytes) to see if the resent segment fixes
      an IW loss:

      if (Retransmitting && IWnotchecked && ((ISN - seqno) < IW))) {
         losscount++;
         IWnotchecked = 0; # never do this entire "if" again
      } else {
         IWnotchecked = 0; # you're beyond the IW so stop checking
      }

   4. Once every 1000 conections, as a separate process (i.e., not as
      part of processing a given connection):

Internet-Draft   Automating the Initial Window in TCP         July 2012


      if (conncount > 1000) {
         if (losscount/conncount > threshold) {
            # the number of connections with errors is too high
            IW = IW * MulDecr;
         } else {
            IW = IW + AddIncr;
         }
      }

   We recognize that this algorithm can yield a false positive when the
   sequence number wraps around. This can be avoided using either PAWS
   [RFC1323] context or 64-bit internal sequence numbers (as in TCP-AO
   [RFC5925]). Alternately, false positives can be allowed since they
   are expected to be infrequent and thus will not affect the overall
   statistics of the algorithm.

   The following additional constraints are imposed:

   >> The automatic IW algorithm MUST initialize to MaxIW, in the
   absence of other context information.

   If there are too few connections to make a decision, or if there is
   otherwise insufficient information to increase the IW, then the
   MaxIW defaults to the current recommended value.

   >> An implementation may allow the MaxIW to grow beyond the
   currently recommended Internet default, but not more than 2 segments
   per calendar year.

   If an endpoint has a persistent history of successfully transmitting
   IW segments without loss, then it is allowed to probe the Internet
   to determine if larger IW values have similar success. This probing
   is limited and requires a trusted time source, otherwise the MaxIW
   remains constant.

   >> An implementation MUST adjust the IW based on loss statistics at
   least once every 1000 connections.

   An endpoint needs to be sufficiently reactive to IW loss.

   >> An implementation MUST decrease the IW by at least one MSS when
   indicated during an evaluation interval.

   An endpoint that detects loss needs to decrease its IW by at least
   one MSS, otherwise it is not participating in an automatic reactive
   algorithm.

   >> An implementation MUST increase by no more than 2 MSS per
   evaluation interval.

   An endpoint that does not experience IW loss needs to probe the
   network incrementally.

   >> An implementation SHOULD use an IW that is an integer multiple of
   2 MSS.

   The IW should remain a multiple of 2 MSS segments, to enable
   efficient ACK compression without incurring unnecessary timeouts.

   >> An implementation MUST decrease the IW if more than 95% of
   connections have IW losses.

   Again, this is to ensure an implementation is sufficiently reactive.

   >> An implementation MAY group IW values and statistics within
   subsets of connections. Such grouping MAY use any information about
   connections to form groups except loss statistics.

   There are some TCP connections which might not be counted at all,
   such as those to/from loopback addresses, or those within the same
   subnet as that of a local interface (for which congestion control is
   sometimes disabled anyway). This may also include connections that
   terminate before the IW is full, i.e., as a separate check at the
   time of the connection closing.

   The period over which the IW is updated is intended to be a long
   timescale, e.g., a month or so, or 1,000 connections, whichever is
   longer. An implementation might check the IW once a month, and
   simply not update the IW or clear the connection counts in months
   where the number of connections is too small.

5. Discussion

   There are numerous parameters to the above algorithm that are
   compliant with the given requirements; this is intended to allow
   variation in configuration and implementation while ensuring that
   all such algorithms are reactive and safe.

   This algorithm continues to assume segments because that is the
   basis of most TCP implementations. It might be useful to consider
   revising the specifications to allow byte-based congestion given
   sufficient experience.

   The algorithm checks for IW losses only during the first IW after a
   connection start; it does not check for IW losses elsewhere the IW
   is used, e.g., during slow-start restarts.

   >> An implementation MAY detect IW losses during slow-start restarts
   in addition to losses during the first IW of a connection. In this
   case, the implementation MUST count each restart as a "connection"
   for the purposes of connection counts and periodic rechecking of the
   IW value.

   False positives can occur during some kinds of segment reordering,
   e.g., that might trigger spurious retransmissions even without a
   true segment loss. These are not expected to be sufficiently common
   to dominate the algorithm and its conclusions.

   This mechanism does require additional per-connection state which is
   currently common in some implementations, and is useful for other
   reasons (e.g., the ISN is used in TCP-AO [RFC5925]). The mechanism
   also benefits from persistent state kept across reboots, as would be
   other state sharing mechanisms (e.g., TCP Control Block Sharing
   [RFC2140]). The mechanism is inspired by RFC 2140's use of
   information across connections.

   The receive window (RWIN) is not involved in this calculation. The
   size of RWIN is determined by receiver resources, and provides space
   to accommodate segment reordering. It is not involved with
   congestion control, which is the focus of this document and its
   management of the IW.

6. Observations

   The IW may not converge to a single, global value. It also may not
   converge at all, but rather may oscillate by a few MSS as it
   repeatedly probes the Internet for larger IWs and fails. Both
   properties are consistent with TCP behavior during each individual
   connection.

   This mechanism assumes that losses during the IW are due to IW size.
   Persistent errors that drop packets for other reasons - e.g., OS
   bugs, can cause false positives. Again, this is consistent with
   TCP's basic assumption that loss is caused by congestion and
   requires backoff. This algorithm treats the IW of new connections as
   a long-timescale backoff system.

7. Security Considerations

   This algorithm presents an opportunity for an intelligent attack to
   reduce the IW of a given system, by repeatedly dropping packets
   during the IW only. An intermediate that can drop packets in a
   controlled manner can already impact the performance of a
   connection, and can reduce the congestion window of an ongoing
   connection in ways that impact performance more than just dropping
   during the IW.

8. IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations. This section should be
   removed prior to publication.

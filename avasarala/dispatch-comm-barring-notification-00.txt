  A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Communication
  Barring Notification Information in support of the Dynamic Incoming
            Communication Barring (ICB) Notification service
       draft-avasarala-dispatch-comm-barring-notification-00.txt

Abstract

   3GPP is defining the protocol specification for the Communication
   Barring (CB) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN)
   subsystem supplementary service and more particularly the dynamic
   incoming communication barring service.  As part of dynamic incoming
   communication barring (ICB) service, a SIP based Event package
   framework is used for notifying users about communication barrings
   (dynamic and rule based) of their incoming communication sessions.
   This document proposes a new SIP event package for allowing users to
   subscribe to and receive such notifications.  Users can further
   define filters to control the rate and content of such notifications.
   The proposed event package is applicable to the ICB supplementary
   service in IMS and may not be applicable to the general internet.

Internet-Draft   SIP Communication Barring Notification         May 2010


1.  Introduction

   3GPP is currently maintaining and specifying incoming communication
   barring mechanisms which allow users to dynamically block incoming
   communications from callers whom they consider as unwanted or
   unsolicited.  The intention of such mechanisms is to provide users
   with sufficient flexibility to manage their incoming communications
   in a better way.  The most common example is the Anonymous
   Communication Rejection (ACR) where in the incoming communications
   from senders whose identity is marked as "Anonymous" is rejected.
   Similarly other variants of ICB include dynamically blocking a
   particular caller by the subscribers, called the dynamic ICB which is
   specified in 3GPP specification [1].

   However, with the increasing number of unwanted calls and increased
   usage of incoming communication barring services, users may have lot
   of callers being blocked from time to time and for different periods
   based on temporary or permanent block.  For instance, a user may have
   blocked a particular caller for a temporary period and specified the
   period as 1 year.  Though there are ways by which users can keep
   track of their communication barrings, there is no efficient
   mechanism for the users to get information of their communication
   barrings that get enacted in the network.  This information would
   help them to verify their rules and rectify if required.

   This document defines a SIP event package that allows a SIP User
   Agents to subscribe to and be notified of communication barrings
   enacted on their behalf.



2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Applicability Statement

   It is believed that the SIP event package defined here is not
   applicable to the general Internet and has been designed to serve the
   architecture of the ICB services in IMS core networks.  The aim of
   this memo is to follow the procedure indicated in RFC 5727 [3] and to
   register a new event package with event name "comm-bar-info" with
   IANA.

Internet-Draft   SIP Communication Barring Notification         May 2010


4.  Abbreviations and Definitions

4.1.  Abbreviations

      ACR: Anonymous Communication Rejection

      CB: Communication Barring.

      ICB: Incoming Communication Barring

      ICBN: Incoming Communication Barring Notification.

      IMS: IP Multimedia System

4.2.  Definitions

      Subscriber - The User Agent who has subscribed to the
      Communication Barring notification service.

      User - Another term for the subscriber.

      Originating User - The User Agent who is the originator of the
      incoming communication, which was initially targeted towards the
      Diverting User, but finally sent to the Diverted-To User.  The
      Originating User is also referred to as the Caller.

      IMS Core Network - This refers to the IMS based SIP based network
      that conforms to the [7] and not the general SIP network as
      defined in [4].


5.  Requirements

   A comprehensive description of all the requirements that affect the
   ICB service developed by 3GPP can be found in the 3GPP specification
   [5].

   For the sake of simplicity, we briefly discuss here those
   requirements that affect the solution described in this document.
   These requirements can be summarized as follows:

   o  There must be a mechanism that allows subscribers to block certain
      categories of incoming communications

   o  There must be a mechanism that allows terminating users to
      register unwanted callers within the network.

Internet-Draft   SIP Communication Barring Notification         May 2010


   o  There must be a mechanism that allows terminating users to block
      unwanted callers either permanently or for a temporary period or
      for a maximum lifetime which is set by the network operator.

   o  There must be a mechanism that enables filtering of notifications
      of communication blocking.

   o  There must be a mechanism that enables triggering of notifications
      of communication blocking.

   o  There must be a mechanism that enables selecting information to be
      included in notifications of communication barring.


   These requirements lead to a solution whereby the user can indicate
   to a network node his interest in receiving certain type of
   notifications of communication blocking.  Pushing these settings to a
   network node allows the network node to conserve scarce resources
   while still notifying the user of communication barrings enacting on
   the user's behalf.


6.  Package Definition

   This section fills in the details needed for an event package as
   defined in Section 4.4 of [6].

6.1.  Event Package Name

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to specify
   the name of their package or template-package.

   The name of this package is "comm-bar-info".  As specified in [6],
   this value appears in the Event header present in SUBSCRIBE and
   NOTIFY requests.

6.2.  Event Package Parameters

   The SIP Events specification [6] allows packages to define additional
   parameters.  This event package "comm-bar-info" does not define
   additional parameters.

6.3.  SUBSCRIBE bodies

   The SIP Events specification requires package or template-package
   definitions to define the usage, if any, of bodies in SUBSCRIBE
   requests.

Internet-Draft   SIP Communication Barring Notification         May 2010


   A SUBSCRIBE for Communication Barring event MAY contain a body.  The
   purpose of the body depends on its type.  Subscriptions to the Comm-
   block-info event package SHALL only include a body of MIME type
   "application/comm-bar-info+xml".

   A body of the SUBSCRIBE request with content type set to MIME type
   "application/comm-bar-info+xml" contains information about the
   communication barring notification information filter criteria and
   notification trigger criteria.  This information is conveyed using
   the XML elements defined in Section 8.1.1.1.

6.4.  Subscription Duration

   The default expiration time for subscriptions within this package is
   3600 seconds.  As per [6], the subscriber MAY specify an alternate
   expiration in the Expires header field.

6.5.  Notify bodies

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to define a
   default value for subscription durations, and to discuss reasonable
   choices for durations when they are explicitly specified.

   The NOTIFY message contains bodies.  This body is a format listed in
   the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE request or a package
   specific default format if the Accept header field was omitted from
   the SUBSCRIBE request.

   In this event package, the body of the notification contains the
   communication barring information pertaining to the barring that
   occurred in the network on behalf of the subscriber.  The format of
   the communication barring information is an XML document as per
   elements defined in Section 8.1.2.  See Section 8.

   All subscribers and notifiers of the "comm-bar-info" event package
   MUST support the "application/comm-bar-info+xml" data format
   described in Section 8.  The SUBSCRIBE request MAY contain an Accept
   header field.  If no such header field is present, it has a default
   value of "application/comm-bar-info+xml" (assuming Event header has a
   value of "comm-bar-info").  If the Accept header field is present, it
   MUST contain the value "application/comm-bar-info+xml".

6.6.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE requests

   The contents of a document containing comm-bar-info information can
   contain sensitive information that can reveal some privacy
   information.  Therefore, such comm-bar-info documents MUST only be
   sent to authorized subscribers.  In order to determine if a

Internet-Draft   SIP Communication Barring Notification         May 2010


   subscription originates in an authorized user, the subscriber MUST be
   authenticated as described in Section 6.6.1 and then the user MUST be
   authorized to be a subscriber as described in Section 6.6.2.

6.6.1.  Authentication

   Notifiers MUST authenticate all subscription requests.  This
   authentication can be done using any of the mechanisms defined in [4]
   and other authentication extensions.

6.6.2.  Authorization

   Once authenticated, the notifier makes an authorization decision.  A
   notifier MUST NOT accept a subscription unless authorization has been
   provided by the user.  The means by which authorization are provided
   are outside the scope of this document.  Authorization may have been
   provided ahead of time through access lists, perhaps specified in a
   web page.  Authorization may have been provided by means of uploading
   some kind of standardized access control list document

6.7.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY requests

   The SIP Events specification details the formatting and structure of
   NOTIFY messages.  However, packages are mandated to provide detailed
   information on when to send a NOTIFY, how to compute the state of the
   resource, how to generate neutral or fake state information, and
   whether state information is complete or partial.  This section
   describes those details for the "comm-bar-info" event package.

   A notifier MAY send a NOTIFY at any time.  Typically, it will send
   one when a communication barring is enacted on behalf of the user.
   The NOTIFY request MAY contain a body containing a comm-bar-info
   document.  The times at which the NOTIFY is sent for a particular
   subscriber, and the contents of the body within that notification,
   are subject to any rules specified by the authorization policy that
   governs the subscription and to preferences indicated at the time of
   subscription.

   The body of the NOTIFY MUST be sent using the type "application/
   comm-bar-info+xml".

   It is RECOMMENDED that the notifiers do maintain the history of last
   N communication barrings that occurred, where the value N >=1 as part
   of state information for that server.  The value of N could be
   configured and is left to server policy to determine appropriate
   value.

   The state information is retained even after the notification for

Internet-Draft   SIP Communication Barring Notification         May 2010


   those barrings are sent to the subscriber and changes when new
   barring occurs.  So every time a new barring occurs, the state
   information changes to reflect the latest barring removing the oldest
   barring information.

6.8.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   The SIP Events specification expects event packages to describe the
   process followed by the subscriber upon receipt of a NOTIFY request.
   In this specification, each NOTIFY request contains a comm-bar-info
   document

6.9.  Handling of Forked Requests

   The SIP Events specification requires each package to describe
   handling of forked Requests.

   This specification only allows a single dialog to be constructed as a
   result of emitting an initial SUBSCRIBE request.  This guarantees
   that only a single notifier is generating notifications for a
   particular subscription to a particular user.

6.10.  Rate of Notifications

   The SIP Events specification requires each package to specify maximum
   rate at which notifications can be sent .

   Comm-bar-info notifiers SHOULD NOT generate notifications for a
   single subscription at a rate of more than once every five seconds.

6.11.  State Agents

   The notifers maintain the state of last N communication barrings,
   where N>=1 that occurred in the network on behalf of the subscriber
   even after the notifications for those N communications barrings are
   sent or unsent.  This state information gets updated with the latest
   communication barring that occurs by removing the oldest
   communication barring and adding the latest barring while maintaining
   the number of barrings at N.

   Thus at any point of time a subscriber MAY know the state of
   communication barrings enacted on his or her behalf by the server.


7.  Comm-bar-info Document

   Comm-block-info document is an XML document [8] that MUST be well-
   formed and SHOULD be valid.  Communication Barring Information

Internet-Draft   SIP Communication Barring Notification         May 2010


   documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8
   [9].


8.  Structure of Comm-bar-info Format

   A Communications Barring Information document starts with a "comm-
   bar-info" element.  The comm-bar-info element has a series of
   elements describing the particular communication barring or the
   filter criteria for receiving the communication barring information.

8.1.  Comm-bar-info Element

   The comm-bar-info element gives information about the specific
   communication barring or it could give information about a particular
   selection criteria for the user receiving the communication barring
   information.

8.1.1.  comm-block-subs-info Element

   The comm-block-subs-info element is used by the subscribing user to
   specify the communication barring information selection criteria and
   the communication barring notification trigger criteria.  It contains
   the following elements:

8.1.1.1.  comm-bar-selection-criteria

   This element contains information about communication barring
   information selection criteria.  It contains following sub-elements
   for specifying the selection criteria.

8.1.1.1.1.  originating-user-selection-criteria

   This element specifies the originating user information for the
   communication i.e. the caller.  This is specified in the form of
   "user-name" and "user-uri".  E.g. sip:Alice@domain.com.  The Username
   as well as User-URI specified will be compared with the originating
   user information of the current user and if there is a match, then
   information about the barring of this specific communication would be
   selected for notification to the Diverting user.  It consists of the
   following sub-elements.

8.1.1.1.1.1.  user-info

   This element gives user details like username and URI.  This element
   has further sub-elements for describing username and user URI

Internet-Draft   SIP Communication Barring Notification         May 2010


8.1.1.1.1.1.1.  User-name

   This element gives Username.  "Alice".

8.1.1.1.1.1.2.  User-URI

   This element gives User URI.  E.g "sip:Alice@domain.com".  It takes
   the form of any URI scheme like sip. sips, tel or any other URI
   scheme

8.1.1.1.2.  barring-type-selection-criteria

   This element specifies the type of barring set by the user.  This
   element can have 2 values: temporary and permanent.  The value
   temporary means that the caller identity is barred for a temporarty
   period specified by the user.  The value permanent means that the
   caller identity is blocked for ever.

8.1.1.1.3.  barring-time-selection-criteria

   This element specifies the time range for receiving notifications.
   It contains following additional elements .

8.1.1.1.3.1.  time-range

   This element specifies the time range at which notifications for
   communication barrings can be sent to the subscriber.  This could be
   specified in the form of a time-interval to enable periodic
   triggering of notifications of communication barrings which took
   place in that time-interval.

   NOTE: If the time-range element is not specified, then notifications
   about every communication barring that occurs is sent to the
   subscriber.

8.1.1.1.3.1.1.  start-time

   This element specifies the start time for receiving notifications.
   Its value is expressed in YYYY:MM:DDTHH:MM:SSZ format.

8.1.1.1.3.1.2.  end-time

   This element specifies the end time for receiving notifications.  Its
   value is expressed in YYYY:MM:DDTHH:MM:SSZ format.

9.  Security Considerations

   Authentication and authorization of subscriptions have been discussed
   in Section 6.6.  Lack of authentication or authorization may provide
   comm-bar-info information to unauthorized parties and can reveal
   sensitive information with regards to the user's call receiving
   patterns.  For example, who calls the user and at what time, etc.

   Integrity protection and confidentiality of notifications are also
   discussed in Section 6.7.  If a notifier does not encrypt bodies of
   NOTIFY requests, an eavesdropper could learn the status of a SIP user
   agent and use it to create malicious sessions.  If the notifier does
   not integrity protect the bodies of NOTIFY requests, a man-in- the-
   middle attacker or malicious SIP proxy could modify the contents of
   the comm-bar-info event package notification.  Although this does not
   cause harm, it can create annoyances.


10.  IANA Considerations

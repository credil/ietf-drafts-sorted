  A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Communication
 Diversion Information in support of the Communication Diversion (CDIV)

         draft-avasarala-dispatch-comm-div-notification-05.txt

Abstract

   3GPP and TISPAN are defining the protocol specification for the
   Communication Diversion (CDIV) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core
   Network (CN) subsystem supplementary service.  As part of CDIV, a SIP
   based Event package framework is used for notifying users about
   diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of their incoming
   communication sessions.  This document proposes a new SIP event
   package for allowing users to subscribe to and receive such
   notifications.  Users can further define filters to control the rate
   and content of such notifications.  The proposed event package is
   applicable to the CDIV supplementary service in IMS and may not be
   applicable to the general internet.

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification      April 2010


1.  Introduction

   3GPP is currently maintaining and specifying communication diversion
   mechanisms which allow users to forward and/or redirect incoming
   communications to other destinations.  The intention of such
   mechanisms is to provide users with sufficient flexibility to manage
   their incoming communications in a better way.  The most common
   example is Communication Forward On Busy (CFB) where in users can
   forward any incoming calls, whilst they are busy on some other call,
   to their voice mail or a suitable alternative (e.g. some other user).
   Similarly other variants of communication diversion are well defined
   and used in practice such as Communication Forward on No Answer
   (CFNA), Communication Forward Unconditional (CFU).  Similarly 3GPP is
   currently maintaining and specifying a mechanism for Users to
   configure Communication Diversion Services ([1] and [2]) for their
   incoming communications.  The intention of such mechanisms is to
   provide Users with sufficient flexibility to manage their incoming
   communications in a better way.

   However, with the increasing usage of Communication Diversion
   services, users may have many different variants and configurations
   active at the same time.  For instance, a user may have various CFU
   services configured differently based on the time-of-the-day and the
   Calling party's identity, or CFB based on the time-of-the-day.  This
   is possible by having various such configured diversions by
   subscribing to different Communication Diversion (CDIV) services as
   specified by 3GPP.  Though, there has been quite active work in the
   area of better customization and configuration of such Communication
   Diversion mechanisms, not much attention has been paid to how the
   Users can manage these services in an effective manner.  With the
   various advanced options and high flexibility provided, it is
   possible that the user loses track of the various Communication
   Diversion configurations or services they have registered for.

   One of the basic ways, by which a user can manage a CDIV service is
   to be informed of which services they have registered for.  For
   example, [1] and [2] allow for such indications to be received by the
   subscriber, at the time of initiating an outgoing call.  However,
   simply showing the registered services is not sufficient, since each
   service may be customized in numerous and different ways for
   different criteria.  For example various instantiations of CFB may be
   configured for different times-of-the-day and different calling party
   identities.  Even if subscribers are shown information about all the
   Communication Diversion services and their variants that they are
   registered for, they may not be able to make sense or verify that
   each of them is correct as per their expectation.  Such a mismatch in
   terms of service behavior expectation and actual execution, may
   happen due to incorrect configuration on behalf of the User, which

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification      April 2010


   cannot be easily detected if there are various communication
   diversion services and their different configurations for handling
   incoming communications.

   A probable and suitable instance, when the subscriber may easily
   judge whether a communication diversion is correct, is when it
   actually takes place.  The subscriber is already aware of the current
   conditions (time-of-day, current presence and availability etc) and
   hence is in a position to decide, whether the communication diversion
   which just occurred, was indeed as per their expectation.  For e.g.
   the subscriber wanted to divert all incoming calls to voice-mail,
   between 3.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m.  Yet, by mistake she configures the
   time-duration as 3.00 to 4.00 p.m.  It would be very difficult for
   her to spot this error while manually reviewing her complete set of
   communication diversion services, with their various configurations.
   Instead, if the subscriber receives a real-time notification of any
   communication diversion occurring after 4 p.m., she would be able to
   immediately guess that something is 'wrong' or not as per her
   intention and take corrective action.  Such corrective action could
   be manual verification of the specific rule which triggered the
   communication diversion, wherein she will be able to spot the
   *mistake* more easily.

   Thus, for effective subscriber services management of multiple
   configurations of various Communication Diversion services, a
   notification-based mechanism may work well.  Such a mechanism would
   involve notifying subscribers about diversions of their incoming
   communications, as and when the communication diversion happens or
   with a slight delay (as per subscriber service configuration).  As
   such diversion-related information is conveyed almost instantly or
   within a small time-frame, the subscribers can verify whether the
   particular communication diversion is indeed correct at that instant
   of time.

   This document defines a SIP event package that allows a SIP User
   Agents to subscribe to and be notified of communication diversions
   enacted on their behalf. .

3.  Applicability Statement

   It is believed that the SIP event package defined here is not
   applicable to the general Internet and has been designed to serve the
   architecture of the CDIV service in IMS core networks.  The aim of
   this memo is to follow the procedure indicated in RFC 5727 [4] and to
   register a new event package with event name "comm-div-info" with
   IANA.

5.  Requirements

   A comprehensive description of all the requirements that affect the
   CDIV service developed by 3GPP can be found in the 3GPP web page at
   http://www.3gpp.org and http://www.etsi.org.

   For the sake of simplicity, we briefly discuss here those
   requirements that affect the solution described in this document.
   These requirements can be summarized as follows:

   o  There must be a mechanism that allows subscriber-controlled
      notification of communication diversions to the diverting user,
      including the option to control which notifications the user wants
      to receive and to control the rate at which notifications are
      received.

   o  There must be a mechanism that enables filtering of notifications
      of communication diversion.

   o  There must be a mechanism that enables triggering of notifications
      of communication diversion.

   o  There must be a mechanism that enables selecting information to be
      included in notifications of communication diversion.


   These requirements lead to a solution whereby the user can indicate
   to a network node his interest in receiving certain type of
   notifications of communication diversion.  Pushing these settings to
   a network node allows the network node to conserve scarce resources
   while still notifying the user of communication diversions enacting
   on the user's behalf.


6.  Package Definition

   This section fills in the details needed for an event package as
   defined in Section 4.4 of [6].

6.1.  Event Package Name

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to specify
   the name of their package or template-package.

   The name of this package is "comm-div-info".  As specified in [6],
   this value appears in the Event header present in SUBSCRIBE and
   NOTIFY requests.

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification      April 2010


6.2.  Event Package Parameters

   The SIP Events specification [6] allows packages to define additional
   parameters.  This event package "comm-div-info" does not define
   additional parameters. .

6.3.  SUBSCRIBE bodies

   The SIP Events specification requires package or template-package
   definitions to define the usage, if any, of bodies in SUBSCRIBE
   requests.

   A SUBSCRIBE for Communication Diversion event MAY contain a body.
   The purpose of the body depends on its type.  Subscriptions to the
   Comm-div-info event package SHALL only include a body of MIME type
   "application/comm-div-info+xml".

   A body of the SUBSCRIBE request with content type set to MIME type
   "application/comm-div-info+xml" contains information about the
   communication diversion notification information filter criteria and
   notification trigger criteria.  The subscriber SHALL also verify that
   this information conforms to a valid XML document as defined in [10].
   The subscriber SHALL also verify that the information contained in
   the XML document contains elements defined in Section 8.1.1 only.

6.4.  Subscription Duration

   The default expiration time for subscriptions within this package is
   3600 seconds.  As per [6], the subscriber MAY specify an alternate
   expiration in the Expires header field.

6.5.  Notify bodies

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to define a
   default value for subscription durations, and to discuss reasonable
   choices for durations when they are explicitly specified.

   The NOTIFY message contains bodies.  This body is a format listed in
   the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE request or a package
   specific default format if the Accept header field was omitted from
   the SUBSCRIBE request.

   In this event package, the body of the notification contains the
   communication diversion information pertaining to the diversion that
   occurred in the network on behalf of the subscriber.  The format of
   the communication diversion information is an XML document as per
   elements defined in Section 8.1.2.

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification      April 2010


   All subscribers and notifiers of the "comm-div-info" event package
   MUST support the "application/comm-div-info+xml" data format
   described in Section 8.  The SUBSCRIBE request MAY contain an Accept
   header field.  If no such header field is present, it has a default
   value of "application/comm-div-info+xml" (assuming Event header has a
   value of "comm-div-info").  If the Accept header field is present, it
   MUST contain the value "application/comm-div-info+xml".

6.6.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE requests

   The contents of a document containing comm-div-info information can
   contain sensitive information that can reveal some privacy
   information.  Therefore, such comm-div-info documents MUST only be
   sent to authorized subscribers.  In order to determine if a
   subscription originates in an authorized user, the subscriber MUST be
   authenticated as described in Section 6.6.1 and then the user MUST be
   authorized to be a subscriber as described in Section 6.6.2.

   The Notifier MUST look into the SUBSCRIBE request body for a comm-
   div-info document containing filter criteria.  If the filter criteria
   is present, it should check if the filter criteria conforms to the
   format described in Section 8.1.1.  If the received criteria is
   valid, then the NOTIFIER MUST use that for generating notifications
   about communication diversions that occur on behalf of the user.

6.6.1.  Authentication

   Notifiers MUST authenticate all subscription requests.  This
   authentication can be done using any of the mechanisms defined in [5]
   and other authentication extensions.

6.6.2.  Authorization

   Once authenticated, the notifier makes an authorization decision.  A
   notifier MUST NOT accept a subscription unless authorization has been
   provided by the user.  The means by which authorization are provided
   are outside the scope of this document.  Authorization may have been
   provided ahead of time through access lists, perhaps specified in a
   web page.  Authorization may have been provided by means of uploading
   some kind of standardized access control list document

6.7.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY requests

   The SIP Events specification details the formatting and structure of
   NOTIFY messages.  However, packages are mandated to provide detailed
   information on when to send a NOTIFY, how to compute the state of the
   resource, how to generate neutral or fake state information, and
   whether state information is complete or partial.  This section



Avasarala, et al.       Expires October 15, 2010                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification      April 2010


   describes those details for the "comm-div-info" event package.

   A notifier MUST send a NOTIFY when a communication diversion is
   enacted on behalf of the user.  If there is a stored filter criteria
   for the user, then the notifier MUST look into the filter criteria
   before generating the NOTIFY request towards the user.  If the filter
   criteria matches, then the notifier generates the NOTIFY request and
   sends the NOTIFY request to the user.  If the filter criteria does
   not match the enacted communication diversion, then the notifier just
   increments the communication diversion count and does not send any
   NOTIFY request towards the user.

   The body of the NOTIFY MUST be sent using the type "application/
   comm-div-info+xml" and must contain the elements defined in
   Section 8.1.2 only.  The Content-Type header field MUST be set to
   "application/comm-div-info+xml".

   Notifiers could detect that a communication diversion was enacted on
   behalf of the subscriber via a "History-Info" header field [7] value,
   per [2] or [1], sent from an application server hosting the CDIV
   service.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the notifiers do maintain the history of last
   N communication diversions that occurred, where the value N >=1 as
   part of state information for that server and include it in the
   communication diversion notification information sent to the user. in
   addition to this it is also RECOMMENDED that the notifiers maintain
   the list of last M communication diversion notifications sent to the
   user, where M equal to or less than N. M equals N if notifications
   are sent for all communication diversions that occurred.  The value M
   is decremented whenever a communication diversion notification is
   sent to the user.  The notifiers check the value of M as being
   greater than 0 prior to generating the notification information.

   The value of N could be configured and is left to server policy to
   determine appropriate value.

   The state information is retained even after the notification for
   those diversions are sent to the subscriber and changes when new
   diversion occurs and whenever a notification is sent.  So every time
   a new diversion occurs and a notification is sent, the state
   information changes to reflect the latest diversion removing the
   oldest diversion information and to reflect the latest notification
   information sent.

6.8.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   The SIP Events specification expects event packages to describe the
   process followed by the subscriber upon receipt of a NOTIFY request.
   In this specification, each NOTIFY request contains a comm-div-info
   document

6.9.  Handling of Forked Requests

   The SIP Events specification requires each package to describe
   handling of forked Requests.

   This specification only allows a single dialog to be constructed as a
   result of emitting an initial SUBSCRIBE request.  This guarantees
   that only a single notifier is generating notifications for a
   particular subscription to a particular user.

6.10.  Rate of Notifications

   The SIP Events specification requires each package to specify maximum
   rate at which notifications can be sent .

   Comm-div-info notifiers SHOULD NOT generate notifications for a
   single subscription at a rate of more than once every five seconds.

6.11.  State Agents

   The notifiers maintain the state of last N communication diversions
   and last M communication diversion notification sent, where N (N>=1)
   is the number of communication diversions that occurred in the
   network on behalf of the subscriber and M is the number of
   communication diversion notifications sent to the user.  If
   notifications are sent for every communication diversion that
   occurred, then M will be equal to N, else M will be less than N if
   filter criteria comes into play.

   Thus at any point of time a subscriber MAY know the state of
   communication diversions enacted on his or her behalf and number of
   notifications sent by the server.


7.  Comm-div-info Document

   Comm-div-info document is an XML document [10] that MUST be well-
   formed and SHOULD be valid.  Communication Diversion Information
   documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8
   [11].

8.  Structure of Comm-div-info Format

   A Communications Diversion Information document starts with a "comm-
   div-info" element.  The comm-div-info element has a series of
   elements describing the particular communication diversion or the
   filter criteria for receiving the communication diversion
   information.

8.1.  Comm-div-info Element

   The comm-div-info element gives information about the specific
   communication diversion or it could give information about a
   particular selection criteria for the user receiving the
   communication diversion information.

8.1.1.  comm-div-subs-info Element

   The comm-div-subs-info element is used by the subscribing user to
   specify the communication diversion information selection criteria
   and the communication diversion notification trigger criteria.  It
   contains the following elements:

8.1.1.1.  comm-div-selection-criteria

   This element contains information about communication diversion
   information selection criteria.  It contains following sub-elements
   for specifying the selection criteria.

8.1.1.1.1.  originating-user-selection-criteria

   This element specifies the originating user information for the
   communication i.e. the caller.  This is specified in the form of
   "user-name" and "user-uri".  E.g. sip:Alice@domain.com.  The Username
   as well as User-URI specified will be compared with the originating
   user information of the current user and if there is a match, then
   information about the diversion of this specific communication would
   be selected for notification to the Diverting user.  It consists of
   the following sub-elements.

8.1.1.1.1.1.  user-info

   This element gives user details like username and URI.  This element
   has further sub-elements for describing username and user URI

8.1.1.1.1.1.1.  User-name

   This element gives Username.  "Alice".

8.1.1.1.1.1.2.  User-URI

   This element gives User URI.  E.g "sip:Alice@domain.com".  It takes
   the form of any URI scheme like sip. sips, tel or any other URI
   scheme

8.1.1.1.2.  diversion-time-selection-criteria

   This element specifies the time range for receiving notifications.
   It contains following additional elements .

8.1.1.1.2.1.  time-range

   This element specifies the time range at which notifications for
   communication diversions can be sent to the subscriber.  This could
   be specified in the form of a time-interval to enable periodic
   triggering of notifications of communication diversions which took
   place in that time-interval.

   NOTE: If the time-range element is not specified, then notifications
   about every communication diversion that occurs is sent to the
   subscriber.

8.1.1.1.2.1.1.  start-time

   This element specifies the start time for receiving notifications.
   Its value is expressed in YYYY:MM:DDTHH:MM:SSZ format.

8.1.1.1.2.1.2.  end-time

   This element specifies the end time for receiving notifications.  Its
   value is expressed in YYYY:MM:DDTHH:MM:SSZ format.

8.1.1.1.3.  diverting-user-selection-criteria

   This element gives details of diverting user.  This element could
   contain the value present in P-Called-Party-ID header field and by
   including the identity in the "diverting-user-info", the receiving UE
   would know if the call was diverted because a rule associated with
   e.g. the "work" public user identities was triggered.  The URI
   specified over here will be compared with the Request URI of the
   diverting user for whom a communication has been diverted.  Only if
   there is a match, then information about the diversion of this
   specific communication would be selected for notification to the
   diverting user.  This is an optional parameter.  If absent, then
   communication diversions towards all registered contacts of the
   subscribing user would be considered for notification, subject to
   other filter criteria.  This element consists of sub-elements defined

9.  Security Considerations

   Authentication and authorization of subscriptions have been discussed
   in Section 6.6.  Lack of authentication or authorization may provide
   comm-div-info information to unauthorized parties and can reveal
   sensitive information with regards to the user's call receiving
   patterns.  For example, who calls the user and at what time, etc.

   Integrity protection and confidentiality of notifications are also
   discussed in Section 6.7.  If a notifier does not encrypt bodies of
   NOTIFY requests, an eavesdropper could learn the status of a SIP user
   agent and use it to create malicious sessions.  If the notifier does
   not integrity protect the bodies of NOTIFY requests, a man-in- the-
   middle attacker or malicious SIP proxy could modify the contents of

   cause harm, it can create annoyances.

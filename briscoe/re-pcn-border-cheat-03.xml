    <abstract>
      <t>Scaling per flow admission control to the Internet is a hard problem.
      The approach of combining Diffserv and pre-congestion notification (PCN)
      provides a service slightly better than Intserv controlled load that
      scales to networks of any size without needing Diffserv's usual
      overprovisioning, but only if domains trust each other to comply with
      admission control and rate policing. This memo claims to solve this
      trust problem without losing scalability. It provides a sufficient
      emulation of per-flow policing at borders but with only passive bulk
      metering rather than per-flow processing. Measurements are sufficient to
      apply penalties against cheating neighbour networks.</t>

    <!-- ================================================================ -->

    <note title="Status (to be removed by the RFC Editor)">
      <t>The IETF PCN working group is initially chartered to consider PCN
      domains only under a single trust authority. However, after its initial
      work is complete the charter says the working group may re-charter to
      consider concatenated Diffserv domains, amongst other new work items.
      The charter ends by stating "The details of these work items are outside
      the scope of the initial phase; but the WG may consider their
      requirements to design components that are sufficiently general to
      support such extensions in the future."</t>

      <t>This memo is therefore contributed to describe how PCN could be
      extended to inter-domain. We wanted to document the solution to reduce
      the chances that something else eats up the codepoint space needed
      before PCN re-charters to consider inter-domain. Losing the chance to
      standardise this simple, scalable solution to the problem of
      inter-domain flow admission control would be unfortunate
      (understatement), given it took years to find, and even then it was very
      difficult to find codepoint space for it.</t>

      <t>The scheme described here (<xref target="repcn_Re-ECN_2_Level" />)
      requires the PCN ingress gateway to re-echo any PCN feedback it receives
      back into the forward stream of IP packets (hence we call this scheme
      re-PCN). Re-PCN works in a very similar way to the re-ECN proposal on
      which it is based <xref target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />, the
      only difference being that PCN might encode three states of congestion,
      whereas ECN encodes two. This document is written to stand alone from
      re-ECN, so that readers do not have to read <xref
      target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />.</t>

      <t>The authors seek comments from the Internet community on whether
      combining PCN and re-ECN to create re-PCN in this way is a sufficient
      solution to the problem of scaling microflow admission control to the
      Internet as a whole. Here we emphasise that scaling is not just an issue
      of numbers of flows, but also the number of security
      entities&mdash;networks and users&mdash;who may all have conflicting
      interests.</t>

      <t>This memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with the intent to
      eventually be broken down in two documents; one for the standards track
      and one for informational status. But until it becomes an item of IETF
      working group business the whole proposal has been kept together to aid
      understanding. Only the text of <xref target="repcn_Re-ECN_2_Level" />
      of this document is intended to be normative (requiring
      standardisation). The rest of the sections are merely informative,
      describing how a system might be built from these protocols by the
      operators of an internetwork. Note in particular that the policing and
      monitoring functions proposed for the trust boundaries between operators
      would not need standardisation by the IETF. They simply represent one
      possible way that the proposed protocols could be used to extend the PCN
      architecture <xref target="RFC5559" /> to span multiple domains without
      mutual trust between the operators.</t>
    </note>

    <note title="Dependencies (to be removed by the RFC Editor)">
      <t>To realise the system described, this document also depends on other
      documents chartered in the IETF Transport Area progressing along the
      standards track: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) marking on interior nodes <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour" />, chartered for
          standardisation in the PCN w-g;</t>

          <t>The baseline encoding of pre-congestion notification in the IP
          header <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding" />, also
          chartered for standardisation in the PCN w-g;</t>

          <!--{ToDo: Add PCN PDB}-->

          <t>Feedback of aggregate PCN measurements by suitably extending the
          admission control signalling protocol (e.g. RSVP extension <xref
          target="RSVP-ECN" /> or NSIS extension <xref
          target="I-D.arumaithurai-nsis-pcn" />).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The baseline encoding makes no new demands on codepoint space in the
      IP header but provides just two PCN encoding states (not marked and
      marked). The PCN architecture recognises that operators might want PCN
      marking to trigger two functions (admission control and flow
      termination) at different levels of pre-congestion, which seems to
      require three encoding states. A scheme has been proposed <xref
      target="I-D.charny-pcn-single-marking" /> that can do both functions
      with just two encoding states, but simulations have shown it performs
      poorly under certain conditions that might be typical. As it seems
      likely that PCN might need three encoding states to be fully
      operational, we want to be sure that three encoding states can be
      extended to work inter-domain. Therefore, we have defined a three-state
      extension encoding scheme in this document, then we have added the
      re-PCN scheme to it. The three-state encoding we have chosen depends on
      standardisation of yet another document in the IETF Transport Area:<list

    <section anchor="repcn_Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Internet community largely lost interest in the Intserv
      architecture after it was clarified that it would be unlikely to scale
      to the whole Internet&nbsp;<xref target="RFC2208" />. Although Intserv
      mechanisms proved impractical, the bandwidth reservation service it
      aimed to offer is still very much required.</t>

      <t>A recently proposed approach&nbsp;<xref target="RFC5559" /> combines
      Diffserv and pre-congestion notification (PCN) to provide a service
      slightly better than Intserv controlled load&nbsp;<xref
      target="RFC2211" />. PCN does not require the considerable
      over-provisioning that is normally required for admission control over
      Diffserv <xref target="RFC2998" /> to be robust against re-routes or
      variation in the traffic matrix. It has been proved that Diffserv's
      over-provisioning requirement grows linearly with the network diameter
      in hops <xref target="QoS_scale" />.</t>

      <t>A number of PCN domains can be concatenated into a larger PCN region
      without any per-flow processing between them, but only if each domain
      trusts the ingress network to have checked that upstream customers
      aren't taking more bandwidth than they reserved, either accidentally or
      deliberately. Unfortunately, networks can gain considerably by breaking
      this trust. One way for a network to protect itself against others is to
      handle flow signalling at its own border and police traffic against
      reservations itself. However, this reintroduces the per-flow
      unscalability at borders that Intserv over Diffserv suffers from.</t>

      <t>This memo describes a protocol called re-PCN that enables bulk border
      measurements so that one network can protect its interests, even if
      networks around it are deliberately trying to cheat. The approach
      provides a sufficient emulation of flow rate policing at trust
      boundaries but without per-flow processing. Per-flow rate policing for
      each reservation is still expected to be used at the access edge of the
      internetwork, but at the borders between networks bulk policing can be
      used to emulate per-flow policing. The emulation is not perfect, but it
      is sufficient to ensure that the punishment is at least proportionate to
      the severity of the cheat. Re-PCN neither requires the unscalable
      over-provisioning of Diffserv nor the per-flow processing at borders of
      Intserv over Diffserv.</t>

      <t>It should therefore scale controlled load service to the whole
      internetwork without the cost of Diffserv's linearly increasing
      over-provisioning, or the cost of per-flow policing at each border. To
      achieve such scaling, this memo combines two recent proposals, both of
      which it briefly recaps: <list style="symbols">
          <t>The pre-congestion notification (PCN) architecture<xref
          target="RFC5559" /> describes how bulk pre-congestion notification
          on routers within an edge-to-edge Diffserv region can emulate the
          precision of per-flow admission control to provide controlled load
          service without unscalable per-flow processing;</t>

          <t>Re-ECN: Adding Accountability to TCP/IP&nbsp;<xref
          target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />.</t>
        </list>We coin the term re-PCN for the combination of PCN and
      re-ECN.</t>

      <t>The trick that addresses cheating at borders is to recognise that
      border policing is mainly necessary because cheating upstream networks
      will admit traffic when they shouldn't only as long as they don't
      directly experience the downstream congestion their misbehaviour can
      cause. The re-ECN protocol ensures a network can be made to experience
      the congestion it causes in other networks. Re-ECN requires the sending
      node to declare expected downstream congestion in all packets and it
      makes it in its interest to declare this honestly. At the border between
      upstream network 'A' and downstream network 'B' (say), both networks can
      monitor packets crossing the border to measure how much congestion 'A'
      is causing in 'B' and beyond. 'B' can then include a limit or penalty
      based on this metric in its contract with 'A'. This is how 'A'
      experiences the effect of congestion it causes in other networks. 'A' no
      longer gains by admitting traffic when it shouldn't, which is why we can
      say re-PCN emulates flow policing, even though it doesn't measure
      flows.</t>

      <t>The aim is not to enable a network to <spanx
      style="emph">identify</spanx> some remote cheating party, which would
      rarely be useful given the victim network would be unlikely to be able
      to seek redress from a cheater in some remote part of the world with
      whom no direct contractual relationship exists. Rather the aim is to
      ensure that any gain from cheating will be cancelled out by penalties
      applied to the cheating party by its local network. Further, the
      solution ensures each of the chain of networks between the cheater and
      the victim will lose out if it doesn't apply penalties to its neighbour.
      Thus the solution builds on the local bilateral contractual
      relationships that already exist between neighbouring networks.</t>

      <t>Rather than the end-to-end arrangement used when re-ECN was specified
      for the TCP transport&nbsp;<xref
      target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />, this memo specifies re-ECN in
      an edge-to-edge arrangement, making it applicable to deployment models
      where admission control over Diffserv is based on pre-congestion
      notification. Also, rather than using a TCP transport for regular
      congestion feedback, this memo specifies re-ECN using RSVP as the
      transport for feedback&nbsp;<xref target="RSVP-ECN" />. RSVP is used to
      be concrete, but a similar deployment model, but with a different
      transport for signalling congestion feedback could be used (e.g.
      Arumaithurai <xref target="I-D.arumaithurai-nsis-pcn" /> and
      RMD&nbsp;<xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-rmd" /> both use NSIS).</t>

      <t>This memo aims to do two things: i) define how to apply the re-PCN
      protocol to the admission control over Diffserv scenario; and ii)
      explain why re-PCN sufficiently emulates border policing in that
      scenario. Most of the memo is taken up with the second aim; explaining
      why it works. Applying re-PCN to the scenario actually involves quite a
      trivial modification to the ingress gateway. That modification can be
      added to gateways later, so our immediate goal is to convince everyone
      to have the foresight to define the PCN wire protocol encoding to
      accommodate the extended codepoints defined in this document, whether
      first deployments require border policing or not. Otherwise, when we
      want to add policing, we will have built ourselves a legacy problem. In
      other words, we aim to convince people to "Design in security from the
      start."</t>

      <t>It must be emphasised that we are not evangelical about removing
      per-flow processing from borders. Network operators may choose to do
      per-flow processing at their borders for their own reasons, such as to
      support business models that require per-flow accounting. Our aim is to
      show that per-flow processing at borders is no longer <spanx
      style="emph">necessary</spanx> in order to provide end-to-end QoS using
      flow admission control. Indeed, we are absolutely opposed to
      standardisation of technology that embeds particular business models
      into the Internet. Our aim is merely to provide a new useful metric
      (downstream congestion) at trust boundaries. Given the well-known
      significance of congestion in economics, operators can then use this new
      metric in their interconnection contracts if they choose. This will
      enable competitive evolution of new business models (for examples
      see&nbsp;<xref target="IXQoS" />), even for sets of flows running
      alongside another set across the same border but using the more
      traditional model that depends on more costly per-flow processing at
      each border.</t>

               title="The Traditional Per-flow Policing Problem">
        <t>If we claim to be able to emulate per-flow policing with bulk
        policing at trust boundaries, we need to know exactly what we are
        emulating. So, we will start from the traditional scenario with
        per-flow policing at trust boundaries to explain why it has always
        been considered necessary.</t>

        <t>To be able to take advantage of a reservation-based service such as
        controlled load, a source-destination pair must reserve resources
        using a signalling protocol such as RSVP&nbsp;<xref
        target="RFC2205" />. An RSVP signalling request refers to a flow of
        packets by its flow ID tuple (filter spec&nbsp;<xref
        target="RFC2205" />) (or its security parameter index (SPI)&nbsp;<xref
        target="RFC2207" /> if port numbers are hidden by IPSec encryption).
        Other signalling protocols use similar flow identifiers. But, it is
        insufficient to merely authorise and admit a flow based on its
        identifiers, for instance merely opening a pin-hole for packets with
        identifiers that match an admitted flow ID. Because, once a flow is
        admitted, it cannot necessarily be trusted to send packets within the
        rate profile it requested.</t>

        <t>The packet rate must also be policed to keep the flow within the
        requested flow spec&nbsp;<xref target="RFC2205" />. For instance,
        without data rate policing, a source-destination pair could reserve
        resources for an 8kbps audio flow but the source could transmit a
        6Mbps video (theft of service). More subtly, the sender could generate
        bursts that were outside the profile requested.</t>

        <t>In traditional architectures, per-flow packet rate-policing is
        expensive and unscalable but, without it, a network is vulnerable to
        such theft of service (whether malicious or accidental). Perhaps more
        importantly, if flows are allowed to send more data than they were
        permitted, the ability of admission control to give assurances to
        other flows will break.</t>

        <t>Just as sources need not be trusted to keep within the requested
        flow spec, whole networks might also try to cheat. We will now set up
        a concrete scenario to illustrate such cheats. Imagine reservations
        for unidirectional flows, through at least two networks, an edge
        network and its downstream transit provider. Imagine the edge network
        charges its retail customers per reservation but also has to pay its
        transit provider a charge per reservation. Typically, both the charges
        for buying from the transit and selling to the retail customer might
        depend on the duration and rate of each reservation. The level of the
        actual selling and buying prices are irrelevant to our discussion
        (most likely the network will sell at a higher price than it buys, of
        course).</t>

        <t>A cheating ingress network could systematically reduce the size of
        its retail customers' reservation signalling requests (e.g. the
        SENDER_TSPEC object in RSVP's PATH message) before forwarding them to
        its transit provider and systematically reinstate the responses on the
        way back (e.g. the FLOWSPEC object in RSVP's RESV message). It would
        then receive an honest income from its upstream retail customer but
        only pay for fraudulently smaller reservations downstream. A similar
        but opposite trick (increasing the TSPEC and decreasing the FLOWSPEC)
        could be perpetrated by the receiver's access network if the
        reservation was paid for by the receiver.</t>

        <t>Equivalently, a cheating ingress network may feed the traffic from
        a number of flows into an aggregate reservation over the transit that
        is smaller than the total of all the flows. Because of these fraud
        possibilities, in traditional QoS reservation architectures the
        downstream network polices traffic at each border. The policer checks
        that the actual sent data rate of each flow is within the signalled
        reservation.</t>

        <t>Reservation signalling could be authenticated end to end, but this
        wouldn't prevent the aggregation cheat just described. For this
        reason, and to avoid the need for a global PKI, signalling integrity
        is typically only protected on a hop-by-hop basis&nbsp;<xref
        target="RFC2747" />.</t>

        <t>A variant of the above cheat is where a router in an honest
        downstream network denies admission to a new reservation, but a
        cheating upstream network still admits the flow. For instance, the
        networks may be using Diffserv internally, but Intserv admission
        control at their borders&nbsp;<xref target="RFC2998" />. The cheat
        would only work if they were using bulk Diffserv traffic policing at
        their borders, perhaps to avoid the cost/complexity of Intserv border
        policing. As far as the cheating upstream network is concerned, it
        gets the revenue from the reservation, but it doesn't have to pay any
        downstream wholesale charges and the congestion is in someone else's
        network. The cheating network may calculate that most of the flows
        affected by congestion in the downstream network aren't likely to be
        its own. It may also calculate that the downstream router has been
        configured to deny admission to new flows in order to protect
        bandwidth assigned to other network services (e.g. enterprise VPNs).
        So the cheating network can steal capacity from the downstream
        operator's VPNs that are probably not actually congested.</t>

        <t>All the above cheats are framed in the context of RSVP's receiver
        confirmed reservation model, but similar cheats are possible with
        sender-initiated and other models.</t>

        <t>To summarise, in traditional reservation signalling architectures,
        if a network cannot trust a neighbouring upstream network to
        rate-police each reservation, it has to check for itself that the data
        rate fits within each of the reservations it has admitted.</t>

        <t>An ingress and egress gateway (Ingr G/W and Egr G/W in <xref
        target="repcn_Fig_Scenario" />) connect the interior Diffserv region
        to the edge access networks where routers (not shown) use per-flow
        reservation processing. Within the Diffserv region are three interior
        domains, 'A', 'B' and 'C', as well as the inward facing interfaces of
        the ingress and egress gateways. An ingress and egress border router
        (BR) is shown interconnecting each interior domain with the next.
        There will typically be other interior routers (not shown) within each
        interior domain.</t>

        <t>In two paragraphs we now briefly recap how pre-congestion
        notification is intended to be used to control flow admission to a
        large Diffserv region. The first paragraph describes data plane
        functions and the second describes signalling in the control plane. We
        omit many details from <xref target="RFC5559" /> including behaviour
        during routing changes. For brevity here we assume other flows are
        already in progress across a path through the Diffserv region before a
        new one arrives, but how bootstrap works is described in <xref
        target="repcn_Aggregate_Bootstrap" />.</t>

        <t><xref target="repcn_Fig_Scenario" /> shows a single simplex
        reserved flow from the sending (Sx) end host to the receiving (Rx) end
        host. The ingress gateway polices incoming traffic and colours
        conforming traffic within an admitted reservation to a combination of
        Diffserv codepoint and ECN field that defines the traffic as
        'PCN-enabled'. This redefines the meaning of the ECN field as a PCN
        field, which is largely the same as ECN <xref target="RFC3168" />, but
        with slightly different semantics defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding" /> (or various extensions that
        are currently experimental). The Diffserv region is called a
        PCN-region because all the queues within it are PCN-enabled. This
        means the per-hop behaviour they apply to PCN-enabled traffic consists
        of both a scheduling behaviour and a new ECN marking behaviour that we
        call `pre-congestion notification' <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour" />. A PCN-enabled queue
        typically re-uses the definition of expedited forwarding
        (EF)&nbsp;<xref target="RFC3246" /> for its scheduling behaviour. The
        new congestion marking behaviour sets the PCN field of an increasing
        proportion of PCN packets to the PCN-marked (PM) codepoint <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding" /> as their load approaches a
        threshold rate that is lower than the line rate <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour" />. This can be achieved with
        an algorithm similar to a token-bucket called a virtual queue. The aim
        is for a queue to start marking PCN traffic to trigger admission
        control before the real queue builds up any congestion delay. The
        level of a queue's pre-congestion marking is detected at the egress of
        the Diffserv region and used by the signalling system to control
        admission of further traffic that would otherwise overload that queue,
        as follows.</t>

        <t>The end-to-end QoS signalling for a new reservation (to be concrete
        we will use RSVP) takes one giant hop from ingress to egress gateway,
        because interior routers within the Diffserv region are configured to
        ignore RSVP. The egress gateway holds flow state because it takes part
        in the end-to-end reservation. So it can classify all packets by flow
        and it can identify all flows that have the same previous RSVP hop (an
        ingress-egress-aggregate). For each ingress-egress-aggregate of flows
        in progress, the egress gateway maintains a per-packet moving average
        of the fraction of pre-congestion-marked traffic. Once an RSVP PATH
        message for a new reservation has hopped across the Diffserv region
        and reached the destination, an RSVP RESV message is returned. As the
        RESV message passes, the egress gateway piggy-backs the relevant
        pre-congestion level onto it&nbsp;<xref target="RSVP-ECN" />. Again,
        interior routers ignore the RSVP message, but the ingress gateway
        strips off the pre-congestion level. If the pre-congestion level is
        above a threshold, the ingress gateway denies admission to the new
        reservation, otherwise it returns the original RESV signal back
        towards the data sender.</t>

        <t>Once a reservation is admitted, its traffic will always receive low
        delay service for the duration of the reservation. This is because
        ingress gateways ensure that traffic not under a reservation cannot
        pass into the PCN-region with a Diffserv codepoint that gives it
        priority over the capacity used for PCN traffic.</t>

        <t>Even if some disaster re-routes traffic after it has been admitted,
        if the PCN traffic through any PCN resource tips over a higher,
        fail-safe threshold, pre-congestion notification can trigger flow
        termination to very quickly bring every router within the whole
        PCN-region back below its operating point. The same marking process
        and ECN codepoint can be used for both admission control and flow
        termination, by simply triggering them at different fractions of
        marking <xref target="I-D.charny-pcn-single-marking" />. However
        simulations have confirmed that this approach is not robust in all
        circumstances that might typically be encountered, so approaches with
        two thresholds and two congestion encodings are expected to be
        required in production networks.</t>

        <t>The whole admission control system just described deliberately
        confines per-flow processing to the access edges of the network, where
        it will not limit the system's scalability. But ideally we want to
        extend this approach to multiple networks, to take even more advantage
        of its scaling potential. We would still need per-flow processing at
        the access edges of each network, but not at the high speed interfaces
        where they interconnect. Even though such an admission control system
        would work technically, it would gain us no scaling advantage if each
        network also wanted to police the rate of each admitted flow for
        itself&mdash;border routers would still have to do complex packet
        operations per-flow anyway, given they don't trust upstream networks
        to do their policing for them.</t>

        <t>This memo describes how to emulate per-flow rate policing using
        bulk mechanisms at border routers. Otherwise the full scalability
        potential of pre-congestion notification would be limited by the need
        for per-flow policing mechanisms at borders, which would make borders
        the most cost-critical pinch-points. Instead we can achieve the long
        sought-for vision of secure Internet-wide bandwidth reservations
        without over-generous provisioning or per-flow processing. We still
        use per-flow processing at the edge routers closest to the end-user,
        but we need no per-flow processing at all in core <spanx
        style="emph">or border routers</spanx>&mdash;where scalability is most
        critical.</t>

    <section anchor="repcn_Re-ECN_2_Level"
             title="Re-ECN Protocol in IP with Two Congestion Marking Levels">
      <!-- ________________________________________________________________ -->

      <section anchor="repcn_Protocol_Overview" title="Protocol Overview">
        <t>First we need to recap the way routers accumulate PCN congestion
        marking along a path (it accumulates the same way as ECN). Each
        PCN-capable queue into a link might mark some packets with a
        PCN-marked (PM) codepoint, the marking probability increasing with the
        length of the queue <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour" />.
        With a series of PCN-capable routers on a path, a stream of packets
        accumulates the fraction of PCN markings that each queue adds. The
        combined effect of the packet marking of all the queues along the path
        signals congestion of the whole path to the receiver. So, for example,
        if one queue early in a path is marking 1% of packets and another
        later in a path is marking 2%, flows that pass through both queues
        will experience approximately 3% marking over a sequence of
        packets.</t>

        <t>(Note: Whenever the word 'congestion' is used in this document it
        should be taken to mean congestion of the virtual resource assigned
        for use by PCN-traffic. This avoids cumbersome repetition of the
        strictly correct term 'pre-congestion'.)</t>

        <t>The packets crossing an inter-domain trust boundary within the
        PCN-region will all have come from different ingress gateways and will
        all be destined for different egress gateways. We will show that the
        key to policing against theft of service is for a border router to be
        able to directly measure the congestion that is about to be caused by
        the packets it forwards into any of the downstream paths between
        itself and the egress gateways that each packet is destined for. The
        purpose of the re-PCN protocol is to make packets automatically carry
        this information, which then merely needs to be counted locally at the
        border.</t>

        <t>With the original PCN protocol, if a border router, e.g. that
        between domains 'A' &amp; 'B' <xref
        target="repcn_Fig_Re-ECN_Concept" />), counts PCN markings crossing
        the border over a period, they represent the accumulated congestion
        that has already been experienced by those packets (congestion
        upstream of the border, u). The idea of re-PCN is to make the ingress
        gateway continuously encode the path congestion it knows into a new
        field in the IP header (in this case, `path' means the path from the
        ingress to the egress gateway). This new field is <spanx

        point on that path (e.g. between domains 'A' &amp; 'B'), IP headers
        can be monitored to measure both expected path congestion, p and
        upstream congestion, u. Then congestion expected downstream of the
        border, v, can be derived simply by subtracting upstream congestion
        from expected path congestion. That is v ~= p - u.</t>

        <t>Importantly, it turns out that there is no need to monitor
        downstream congestion on a per-flow, per-path or per-aggregate basis.
        We will show that accounting for it in bulk by counting the volume of
        all marked packet will be sufficient.</t>

               title="Re-PCN Abstracted Network Layer Wire Protocol (IPv4 or v6)">
        <t>In this section we define the names of the various codepoints of
        the extended ECN field when used with pre-congestion notification,
        deferring description of their semantics to the following sections.
        But first we recap the re-ECN wire protocol proposed in <xref
        target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />.</t>

        <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  -->

        <section anchor="repcn_Re-ECN_Recap" title="Re-ECN Recap">
          <t>Re-ECN uses the two bit ECN field broadly as in
          RFC3168&nbsp;<xref target="RFC3168" />. It also uses a new re-ECN
          extension (RE) flag. The actual position of the RE flag is different
          between IPv4 &amp; v6 headers so we will use an abstraction of the
          IPv4 and v6 wire protocols by just calling it the RE flag. <xref
          target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" /> proposes using bit 48
          (currently unused) in the IPv4 header for the RE flag, while for
          IPv6 it proposes an congestion extension header.</t>

          <t>Unlike the ECN field, the RE flag is intended to be set by the
          sender and remain unchanged along the path, although it can be read
          by network elements that understand the re-ECN protocol. In the
          scenario used in this memo, the ingress gateway is the 'sender' as
          far as the scope of the PCN region is concerned, so it sets the RE
          flag (as permitted for sender proxies in the specification of
          re-ECN).</t>

          <t>Note that general-purpose routers do not have to read the RE
          flag, only special policing elements at borders do. And no
          general-purpose routers have to change the RE flag, although the
          ingress and egress gateways do because in the edge-to-edge
          deployment model we are using, they act as the endpoints of the PCN
          region. Therefore the RE flag does not even have to be visible to
          interior routers. So the RE flag has no implications on protocols
          like MPLS. Congested label switching routers (LSRs) would have to be
          able to notify their congestion with an ECN/PCN codepoint in the
          MPLS shim&nbsp;<xref target="RFC5129" />, but like any interior IP
          router, they can be oblivious to the RE flag, which need only be
          read by border policing functions.</t>

          <t>Although the RE flag is a separate single bit field, it can be
          read as an extension to the two-bit ECN field; the three
          concatenated bits in what we will call the extended ECN field (EECN)
          make eight codepoints available. When the RE flag setting is "don't
          care", we use the RFC3168 names of the ECN codepoints, but <xref
          target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" /> proposes the following six
          codepoint names for when there is a need to be more specific.</t>

        <section anchor="repcn_Re-PCN"
                 title="Re-ECN Combined with Pre-Congestion Notification (re-PCN)">
          <t>As permitted by the ECN specification&nbsp;<xref
          target="RFC3168" /> and by the guidelines for specifying alternative
          semantics for the ECN field <xref target="RFC4774" />, a proposal is
          currently being advanced in the IETF to define different semantics
          for how queues might mark the ECN field of certain packets. The idea
          is to be able to notify congestion when the queue's load approaches
          a logical limit, rather than the physical limit of the line. This
          new marking is called pre-congestion notification&nbsp;<xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour" /> and we will use the term
          PCN-enabled queue for a queue that can apply pre-congestion
          notification marking to the ECN fields of packets.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC3168" /> recommends that a packet's Diffserv
          codepoint should determine which type of ECN marking it receives. A
          PCN-capable packet must meet two conditions; it must carry a DSCP
          that has been associated with PCN marking and it must carry an ECN
          field that turns on PCN marking.</t>

          <t>As an example, a packet carrying the VOICE-ADMIT <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-admitted-realtime-dscp" /> DSCP would be
          associated with expedited forwarding <xref target="RFC3246" /> as
          its scheduling behaviour and pre-congestion notification as its
          congestion marking behaviour. PCN would only be turned on within a
          PCN-region by an ECN codepoint other than Not-ECT (00). Then we
          would describe packets with the VOICE-ADMIT DSCP and with ECN turned
          on as PCN-capable packets.</t>

          <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour" /> actually
          proposes that two logical limits can be used for pre-congestion
          notification, with the higher limit as a back-stop for dealing with
          anomalous events. It envisages PCN will be used to admission control
          inelastic real-time traffic, so marking at the lower limit will
          trigger admission control, while at the higher limit it will trigger
          flow termination.</t>

          <t>Because it needs two types of congestion marking, PCN needs four
          states: Not PCN-capable (Not-PCN), PCN-capable but not PCN-marked
          (NM), Admission Marked (AM) and Flow Termination Marked (TM). A
          proposed encoding of the four required PCN states is shown on the
          left of <xref target="repcn_Tab_PC_EECN_Codepoints" />. Note that
          these codepoints of the ECN field only take on the semantics of
          pre-congestion notification if they are combined with a Diffserv
          codepoint that the operator has configured to be associated with PCN
          marking.</t>

          <t>This encoding only correctly traverses an IP in IP tunnel if the
          ideal decapsulation rules in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel" /> are followed when combining
          the ECN fields of the outer and inner headers. If instead the
          decapsulation rules in <xref target="RFC3168" /> or <xref
          target="RFC4301" /> are followed, any admission marking applied to
          an outer header will be incorrectly removed on decapsulation at the
          tunnel egress.</t>

          <t>The RFC3168 ECN field includes space for the experimental ECN
          Nonce&nbsp;<xref target="RFC3540" />, which seems to require a fifth
          state if it is also needed with re-PCN. But re-PCN supersedes any
          need for the Nonce within the PCN-region. The ECN Nonce is an
          elegant scheme, but it only allows a sending node (or its proxy) to
          detect suppression of congestion marking in the feedback loop. Thus
          the Nonce requires the sender (or in our case the PCN ingress) to be
          trusted to respond correctly to congestion. But this is precisely
          the main cheat we want to protect against (as well as many others).
          Also, the ECN nonce only works once the receiver has placed packets
          in the same order as they left the ingress, which cannot be done by
          an edge node without adding unnecessary edge-edge packet ordering.
          Nonetheless, if the ECN nonce were in use outside the PCN region
          (end-to-end), the ingress would have to tunnel the arriving IP
          header across the PCN region (<xref target="RFC5559" />).</t>

          <t>For the rest of this memo, to mean either Admission Marking or
          Termination Marking we will call both "congestion marking" or "PCN
          marking" unless we need to be specific. With the above encoding,
          congestion marking can be read to mean any packet with the
          right-most bit of the ECN field set.</t>

          <t>The re-ECN protocol can be used to control misbehaving sources
          whether congestion is with respect to a logical threshold (PCN) or
          the physical line rate (ECN). In either case the RE flag can be used
          to create an extended ECN field. For PCN-capable packets, the 8
          possible encodings of this 3-bit extended PCN (EPCN) field are
          defined on the right of <xref
          target="repcn_Tab_PC_EECN_Codepoints" /> below. The purposes of
          these different codepoints will be introduced in subsequent
          sections.</t>

        <section anchor="repcn_Protocol_Operation_Established"
                 title="Protocol Operation for an Established Flow">
          <t>The re-PCN protocol involves a simple addition to the action of
          the gateway at the ingress edge of the PCN region (the
          PCN-ingress-node). But first we will recap how PCN works without the
          addition. For each active traffic aggregate across a PCN region
          (ingress-egress-aggregate) the egress gateway measures the level of
          PCN marking and feeds it back to the ingress piggy-backed as
          'PCN-feedback-information' on any control signal passing between the
          nodes (e.g. every flow set-up, refresh or tear-down). Therefore the
          ingress gateway will always hold a fairly recent (typically at most
          30sec) estimate of the ingress-egress-aggregate congestion level.
          For instance, one aggregate might have been experiencing 3%
          pre-congestion (that is, congestion marked octets whether Admission
          Marked or Termination Marked).</t>

          <t>To comply with the re-PCN protocol, for all PCN packets in each
          ingress-egress-aggregate the ingress gateway MUST clear the RE flag
          to <spanx style="verb">0</spanx> for the same percentage of octets
          as its current estimate of congestion on the aggregate (e.g. 3%) and
          set it to <spanx style="verb">1</spanx> in the rest (97%). <xref
          target="repcn_Alg_Blanking_RE" /> gives a simple pseudo-code
          algorithm that the ingress gateway may use to do this.</t>

          <t>The RE flag is set and cleared this way round for incremental
          deployment reasons (see <xref target="repcn_Deployment" />). To
          avoid confusion we will use the term `blanking' (rather than
          marking) when the RE flag is cleared to <spanx
          style="verb">0</spanx>, so we will talk of the `RE blanking
          fraction' as the fraction of octets with the RE flag cleared to
          <spanx style="verb">0</spanx>.</t>

          illustrates our example. The horizontal axis represents the index of
          each congestible resource (typically queues) along a path through
          the Internet. The two superimposed plots show the fraction of each
          extended PCN codepoint observed along this path, assuming there are
          two congested routers somewhere within domains A and C. And <xref
          target="repcn_Tab_Downstream_Congestion_Example" /> below shows the
          downstream pre-congestion measured at various border observation
          points along the path. <xref
          target="repcn_Fig_Policing_Framework" /> (later) shows the same
          results of these subtractions, but in graphical form like the above
          figure. The tabulated figures are actually reasonable approximations
          derived from more precise formulae given in Appendix A of <xref
          target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />. The RE flag is not changed
          by interior routers, so it can be seen that it acts as a reference
          against which the congestion marking fraction can be compared along
          the path.</t>

          <t>Note that the ingress determines the RE blanking fraction for
          each aggregate using the most recent feedback from the relevant
          egress, arriving with each new reservation, or each refresh. These
          updates arrive relatively infrequently compared to the speed with
          which congestion changes. Although this feedback will always be out
          of date, on average positive errors should cancel out negative over
          a sufficiently long duration.</t>

          <t>In summary, the network adds pre-congestion marking in the
          forward data path, the egress feeds its level back to the ingress in
          RSVP (or similar signalling), then the ingress gateway re-echoes it
          into the forward data path by blanking the RE flag. Then at any
          border within the PCN-region, the pre-congestion marking that every
          passing packet will be expected to experience downstream can be
          measured to be the RE blanking fraction minus the congestion marking
          fraction.</t>

        <section anchor="repcn_Aggregate_Bootstrap"
                 title="Aggregate Bootstrap">
          <t>When a new reservation PATH message arrives at the egress, if
          there are currently no flows in progress from the same ingress,
          there will be no state maintaining the current level of
          pre-congestion marking for the aggregate. In the case of RSVP
          reservation signalling, while the signal continues onward towards
          the receiving host, the egress gateway can return an RSVP message to
          the ingress with a flag&nbsp;<xref target="RSVP-ECN" /> asking the
          ingress to send a specified number of data probes between them. The
          more general possibilities for bootstrap behaviour are described in
          the PCN architecture&nbsp;<xref target="RFC5559" />, including
          using the reservation signal itself as a probe.</t>

          <t>However, with our new re-PCN scheme, the ingress does not know
          what proportion of the data probes should have the RE flag blanked,
          because it has no estimate yet of pre-congestion for the path across
          the PCN-region.</t>

          <t>To be conservative, following the guidance for specifying other
          re-ECN transports in <xref target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />,
          the ingress SHOULD set the FNE codepoint of the extended PCN header
          in all probe packets (<xref
          target="repcn_Tab_PC_EECN_Codepoints" />). As per the PCN deployment
          model, the egress gateway measures the fraction of congestion-marked
          probe octets and feeds back the resulting pre-congestion level to
          the ingress, piggy-backed on the returning reservation response
          (RESV) for the new flow. Probe packets are identifiable by the
          egress because they carry the FNE codepoint.</t>

          <t>It may seem inadvisable to expect the FNE codepoint to be set on
          probes, given legacy firewalls etc. might discard such packets
          (because this flag had no previous legitimate use). However, in the
          deployment scenarios envisaged, each domain in the PCN-region has to
          be explicitly configured to support the admission controlled
          service. So, before deploying the service, the operator MUST
          reconfigure such a badly implemented middlebox to allow through
          packets with the RE flag set.</t>

          <t>Note that we have said SHOULD rather than MUST for the FNE
          setting behaviour of the ingress for probe packets. This entertains
          the possibility of an ingress implementation having the benefit of
          other knowledge of the path, which it re-uses for a newly starting
          aggregate. For instance, it may hold cached information from a
          recent use of the aggregate that is still sufficiently current to be
          useful. If not all probe packets are set to FNE, the ingress will
          have to ensure probe packets are identifiable by some other means,
          perhaps by using the egress as the destination address.</t>

          <t>It might seem pedantic worrying about these few probe packets,
          but this behaviour ensures the system is safe, even if the
          proportion of probe packets becomes large.</t>

        <section anchor="repcn_Flow_Bootstrap" title="Flow Bootstrap">
          <t>It might be expected that a new flow within an active aggregate
          would need no special bootstrap behaviour. If there was an aggregate
          already in progress between the gateways the new flow was about to
          use, it would inherit the prevailing RE blanking fraction. And if
          there were no active aggregate, the bootstrap behaviour for an
          aggregate would be appropriate and sufficient for the new flow.</t>

          <t>However, for a number of reasons, at least the first packet of
          each new flow SHOULD be set to the FNE codepoint, irrespective of
          whether it is joining an active aggregate or not. If the first
          packet is unlikely to be reliably delivered, a number of FNE packets
          MAY be sent to increase the probability that at least one is
          delivered to the egress gateway.</t>

          <t>If each flow does not start with an FNE packet, it will be seen
          later that sanctions may be too strict at the interface before the
          egress gateway. It will often be possible to apply sanctions at the
          granularity of aggregates rather than flows, but in an
          internetworked environment it cannot be guaranteed that aggregates
          will be identifiable in remote networks. So setting FNE at the start
          of each flow is a safe strategy. For instance, a remote network may
          have equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing enabled, causing different
          flows between the same gateways to traverse different paths.</t>

          <t>After an idle period of more than 1 second, the ingress gateway
          SHOULD set the EPCN field of the next packet it sends to FNE. This
          allows the design of network policers to be deterministic (see <xref
          target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />).</t>

          <t>However, if the ingress gateway can guarantee that the network(s)
          that will carry the flow to its egress gateway all use a common
          identifier for the aggregate (e.g. a single MPLS network without
          ECMP routing), it MAY NOT set FNE when it adds a new flow to an
          active aggregate. And an FNE packet need only be sent if a whole
          aggregate has been idle for more than 1 second.</t>

                 title="Router Forwarding Behaviour">
          <t>Adding re-PCN works well with the regular PCN forwarding
          behaviour of interior queues. However, below, two optional changes
          are proposed when forwarding packets with a per-hop-behaviour that
          requires pre-congestion notification:<list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Preferential drop:">When a router cannot avoid
              dropping PCN-capable packets, preferential dropping of packets
              with different extended PCN codepoints SHOULD be implemented
              between packets within a PHB that uses PCN marking. The drop
              preference order to use is defined in <xref
              target="repcn_Tab_Drop_Pref" />. Note that to reduce
              configuration complexity, Re-PCT-Echo and FNE MAY be given the
              same drop preference, but if feasible, FNE SHOULD be dropped in
              preference to Re-PCT-Echo.<vspace blankLines="1" />If this
              proposal were advanced at the same time as PCN itself, we would
              recommend that preferential drop based on extended PCN codepoint
              SHOULD be added to router forwarding at the same time as PCN
              marking. Preferential dropping can be difficult to implement,
              but we RECOMMEND this security-related re-PCN improvement where
              feasible as it is an effective defence against flooding
              attacks.</t>

              <t hangText="Marking vs. Drop:">We propose that PCN-routers
              SHOULD inspect the RE flag as well as the ECN field to decide
              whether to drop or mark PCN DSCPs. They MUST choose drop if the
              codepoint of this extended ECN field is Not-PCN. Otherwise they
              SHOULD mark (unless, of course, buffer space is
              exhausted).<vspace blankLines="1" />A PCN-capable router MUST
              NOT ever congestion mark a packet carrying the Not-PCN codepoint
              because the transport will only understand drop, not congestion
              marking. But a PCN-capable router can mark rather than drop an
              FNE packet, even though its ECN field when looked at in
              isolation is '00' which appears to be a legacy Not-ECT packet.
              Therefore, if a packet's RE flag is '1', even if its ECN field
              is '00', a PCN-enabled router SHOULD use congestion marking.
              This allows the `feedback not established' (FNE) codepoint to be
              used for probe packets, in order to pick up PCN marking when
              bootstrapping an aggregate.<vspace blankLines="1" />PCN marking
              rather than dropping of FNE packets MUST only be deployed in
              controlled environments, such as that in <xref
              target="RFC5559" />, where the presence of an egress node that
              understands PCN marking is assured. Congestion events might
              otherwise be ignored if the receiver only understands drop,
              rather than PCN marking. This is because there is no guarantee
              that PCN capability has been negotiated if feedback is not
              established (FNE). Also, <xref
              target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" /> places the strong
              condition that a router MUST apply drop rather than marking to
              FNE packets unless it can guarantee that FNE packets are rate
              limited either locally or upstream.</t>

      <t>The following sections are informative, not normative. The re-PCN
      protocol described in <xref target="repcn_Re-ECN_2_Level" /> above would
      require standardisation, whereas operators acting in their own interests
      would be expected to deploy policing and monitoring functions similar to
      those proposed in the sections below without any further need for
      standardisation by the IETF. Flexibility is expected in exactly how
      policing and monitoring is done.</t>

      <section anchor="repcn_Informal_Terminology"
               title="Informal Terminology">
        <t>In the rest of this memo, where the context makes it clear, we will
        sometimes loosely use the term `congestion' rather than using the
        stricter `downstream pre-congestion'. Also we will loosely talk of
        positive or negative flows, meaning flows where the moving average of
        the downstream pre-congestion metric is persistently positive or
        negative. The notion of a negative metric arises because it is derived
        by subtracting one metric from another. Of course actual downstream
        congestion cannot be negative, only the metric can (whether due to
        time lags or deliberate malice).</t>

        <t>Just as we will loosely talk of positive and negative flows, we
        will also talk of positive or negative packets, meaning packets that
        contribute positively or negatively to downstream pre-congestion.</t>

        <t>Therefore packets can be considered to have a `worth' of +1, 0 or
        -1, which, when multiplied by their size, indicates their contribution
        to downstream congestion. Packets will usually be initialised by the
        PCN ingress with a worth of 0. Blanking the RE flag increments the
        worth of a packet to +1. Congestion marking a packet decrements its
        worth (whether admission marking or termination marking). Congestion
        marking a previously blanked packet cancels out the positive worth
        with the negative worth of the congestion marking (resulting in a
        packet worth 0). The FNE codepoint is an exception. It has the same
        positive worth as a packet with the Re-PCT-Echo codepoint. The table
        below specifies unambiguously the worth of each extended PCN
        codepoint. Note the order is different from the previous table to
        emphasise how congestion marking processes decrement the worth (with
        the exception of FNE).</t>

        pre-congestion across the same path through the Internet.</t>

        <t>To emulate border policing, the general idea is for each domain to
        apply penalties to its upstream neighbour in proportion to the amount
        of downstream pre-congestion that the upstream network sends across
        the border. That is, the penalties should be in proportion to the
        height of the plot. Downward arrows in the figure show the resulting
        pressure for each domain to under-declare downstream pre-congestion in
        traffic they pass to the next domain, because of the penalties.</t>

        <t>These penalties seem to encourage everyone to understate downstream
        congestion in order to reduce the penalties they incur. But a
        balancing pressure is introduced by the last domain (strictly by any
        domain), which applies sanctions to flows if downstream congestion
        goes negative before the egress gateway. The upward arrow at Domain
        C's border with the egress gateway represents the incentive the
        sanctions would create to prevent negative traffic. The same upward
        pressure can be applied at any domain border (arrows not shown).</t>

        <t>Any flow that persistently goes negative by the time it leaves a
        domain must not have been marked correctly in the first place. A
        domain that discovers such a flow can adopt a range of strategies to
        protect itself. Which strategy it uses will depend on policy, because
        it cannot immediately assume malice&mdash;there may be an innocent
        configuration error somewhere in the system.</t>

        <t>This memo does not propose to standardise any particular mechanism
        to detect persistently negative flows, but <xref
        target="repcn_Sanctioning_Dishonest_Marking" /> does give examples.
        Note that we have used the term flow, but there will be no need to
        bury into the transport layer for port numbers; identifiers visible in
        the network layer will be sufficient (IP address pair, DSCP, protocol
        ID). The appendix also gives a mechanism to limit the required flow
        state, preventing state exhaustion attacks.</t>

        <t>Of course, some domains may trust other domains to comply with
        admission control without applying sanctions or penalties. In these
        cases, the protocol should still be used but no penalties need be
        applied. The re-PCN protocol ensures downstream pre-congestion marking
        is passed on correctly whether or not penalties are applied to it, so
        the system works just as well with a mixture of some domains trusting
        each other and others not.</t>

        <t>Providers should be free to agree the contractual terms they wish
        between themselves, so this memo does not propose to standardise how
        these penalties would be applied. It is sufficient to standardise the
        re-PCN protocol so the downstream pre-congestion metric is available
        if providers choose to use it. However, the next section (<xref
        target="repcn_Pre-requisite_Contract" />) gives some examples of how
        these penalties might be implemented.</t>
      </section>

      <!-- ________________________________________________________________ -->

      <section anchor="repcn_Pre-requisite_Contract"
               title="Pre-requisite Contractual Arrangements">
        <t>The re-PCN protocol has been chosen to solve the policing problem
        because it embeds a downstream pre-congestion metric in passing PCN
        traffic that is difficult to lie about and can be measured in bulk.
        The ability to emulate border policing depends on network operators
        choosing to use this metric as one of the elements in their contracts
        with each other.</t>

        <t>Already many inter-domain agreements involve a capacity and a usage
        element. The usage element may be based on volume or various measures
        of peak demand. We expect that those network operators who choose to
        use pre-congestion notification for admission control would also be
        willing to consider using this downstream pre-congestion metric as a
        usage element in their interconnection contracts for admission
        controlled (PCN) traffic.</t>

        <t>Congestion (or pre-congestion) has the dimension of [octet], being
        the product of volume transferred [octet] and the congestion fraction
        [dimensionless], which is the fraction of the offered load that the
        network isn't able to serve (or would rather not serve in the case of
        pre-congestion). Measuring downstream congestion gives a measure of
        the volume transferred but modulated by congestion expected
        downstream. So volume transferred during off-peak periods counts as
        nearly nothing, while volume transferred at peak times or over
        temporarily congested links counts very highly. The re-PCN protocol
        allows one network to measure how much pre-congestion has been
        `dumped' into it by another network. And then in turn how much of that
        pre-congestion it dumped into the next downstream network.</t>

        <t><xref target="repcn_Border_Mechanisms" /> describes mechanisms for
        calculating border penalties referring to <xref
        target="repcn_Alg_Metering" /> for suggested metering algorithms for
        downstream congestion at a border router. Conceptually, it could
        hardly be simpler. It broadly involves accumulating the volume of
        packets with the RE flag blanked and the volume of those with
        congestion marking then subtracting the two.</t>

        <t>Once this downstream pre-congestion metric is available, operators
        are free to choose how they incorporate it into their interconnection
        contracts&nbsp;<xref target="IXQoS" />. Some may include a threshold
        volume of pre-congestion as a quality measure in their service level
        agreement, perhaps with a penalty clause if the upstream network
        exceeds this threshold over, say, a month. Others may agree a set of
        tiered monthly thresholds, with increasing penalties as each threshold
        is exceeded. But, it would be just as easy, and more resistant to
        gaming, to do away with discrete thresholds, and instead make the
        penalty rise smoothly with the volume of pre-congestion by applying a
        price to pre-congestion itself. Then the usage element of the
        interconnection contract would directly relate to the volume of
        pre-congestion caused by the upstream network.</t>

        <t>The direction of penalties and charges relative to the direction of
        traffic flow is a constant source of confusion. Typically, where
        capacity charges are concerned, lower tier customer networks pay
        higher tier provider networks. So money flows from the edges to the
        middle of the internetwork, towards greater connectivity, irrespective
        of the flow of data. But we advise that penalties or charges for usage
        should follow the same direction as the data flow&mdash;the direction
        of control at the network layer. Otherwise a network lays itself open
        to `denial of funds' attacks. So, where a tier 2 provider sends data
        into a tier 3 customer network, we would expect the penalty clauses
        for sending too much pre-congestion to be against the tier 2 network,
        even though it is the provider.</t>

        <t>It may help to remember that data will be flowing in the other
        direction too. So the provider network has as much opportunity to levy
        usage penalties as its customer, and it can set the price or strength
        of its own penalties higher if it chooses. Usage charges in both
        directions tend to cancel each other out, which confirms that
        usage-charging is less to do with revenue raising and more to do with
        encouraging load control discipline in order to smooth peaks and
        troughs, improving utilisation and quality.</t>

        <t>Further, when operators agree penalties in their interconnection
        contracts for sending downstream congestion, they should make sure
        that any level of negative marking only equates to zero penalty. In
        other words, penalties are always paid in the same direction as the
        data, and never against the data flow, even if downstream congestion
        seems to be negative. This is consistent with the definition of
        physical congestion; when a resource is underutilised, it is not
        negatively congested. Its congestion is just zero. So, although short
        periods of negative marking can be tolerated to correct temporary
        over-declarations due to lags in the feedback system, persistent
        downstream negative congestion can have no physical meaning and
        therefore must signify a problem. The incentive for domains not to
        tolerate persistently negative traffic depends on this principle that
        negative penalties must never be paid for negative congestion.</t>

        <t>Also note that at the last egress of the PCN-region, domain C
        should not agree to pay any penalties to the egress gateway for
        pre-congestion passed to the egress gateway. Downstream pre-congestion
        to the egress gateway should have reached zero here. If domain C were
        to agree to pay for any remaining downstream pre-congestion, it would
        give the egress gateway an incentive to over-declare pre-congestion
        feedback and take the resulting profit from domain C.</t>

        <t>To focus the discussion, from now on, unless otherwise stated, we
        will assume a downstream network charges its upstream neighbour in
        proportion to the pre-congestion it sends (V_b in the notation of
        <xref target="repcn_Alg_Metering" />). Effectively tiered thresholds
        would be just more coarse-grained approximations of the fine-grained
        case we choose to examine. If these neighbours had previously agreed
        that the (fixed) price per octet of pre-congestion would be L, then
        the bill at the end of the month would simply be the product L*V_b,
        plus any fixed charges they may also have agreed.</t>

        <t>We are well aware that the IETF tries to avoid standardising
        technology that depends on a particular business model. Indeed, this
        principle is at the heart of all our own work. Our aim here is to make
        a new metric available that we believe is superior to all existing
        metrics. Then, our aim is to show that bulk border policing can at
        least work with the one model we have just outlined. Of course,
        operators are free to complement this pre-congestion-based usage
        element of their charges with traditional capacity charging, and we
        expect they will. But if operators don't want to use this business
        model at all, they don't have to do bulk border policing. We also
        assume that operators might experiment with the metric in other
        models.</t>

        <t>Also note well that everything we discuss in this memo only
        concerns interconnection within the PCN-region. ISPs are free to sell
        or give away reservations however they want on the retail market. But
        of course, interconnection charges will have a bearing on that.
        Indeed, in the present scenario, the ingress gateway effectively sells
        reservations on one side and buys congestion penalties on the other.
        As congestion rises, one can imagine the gateway discovering that
        congestion penalties have risen higher than the (probably fixed)
        revenue it will earn from selling the next flow reservation. This
        encourages the gateway to cut its losses by blocking new calls, which
        is why we believe downstream congestion penalties can emulate per-flow
        rate policing at borders, as the next section explains.</t>
      </section>

      <!-- ________________________________________________________________ -->

      <section anchor="repcn_Emulation_Rationale_Limits"
               title="Emulation of Per-Flow Rate Policing: Rationale and Limits">
        <t>The important feature of charging in proportion to congestion
        volume is that the penalty aggregates and disaggregates correctly
        along with packet flows. This is because the penalty rises linearly
        with bit rate (unless congestion is absolutely zero) and linearly with
        congestion, because it is the product of them both. So if the packets
        crossing a border belong to a thousand flows, and one of those flows
        doubles its rate, the ingress gateway forwarding that flow will have
        to put twice as much congestion marking into the packets of that flow.
        And this extra congestion marking will add proportionately to the
        penalties levied at every border the flow crosses in proportion to the
        amount of pre-congestion remaining on the path.</t>

        <t>Effectively, usage charges will continuously flow from ingress
        gateways to the places generating pre-congestion marking, in
        proportion to the pre-congestion marking introduced and to the data
        rates from those gateways.</t>

        <t>As importantly, pre-congestion itself rises super-linearly with
        utilisation of a particular resource. So if someone tries to push
        another flow into a path that is already signalling enough
        pre-congestion to warrant admission control, the penalty will be a lot
        greater than it would have been to add the same flow to a less
        congested path. This makes the incentive system fairly insensitive to
        the actual level of pre-congestion for triggering admission control
        that each ingress chooses. The deterrent against exceeding whatever
        threshold is chosen rises very quickly with a small amount of
        cheating.</t>

        <t>These are the properties that allow re-PCN to emulate per-flow
        border policing of both rate and admission control. It is not a
        perfect emulation of per-flow border policing, but we claim it is
        sufficient to at least ensure the cost to others of a cheat is borne
        by the cheater, because the penalties are at least proportionate to
        the level of the cheat. If an edge network operator is selling
        reservations at a large profit over the congestion cost, these
        pre-congestion penalties will not be sufficient to ensure networks in
        the middle get a share of those profits, but at least they can cover
        their costs.</t>

        <t>We will now explain with an example. When a whole inter-network is
        operating at normal (typically very low) congestion, the
        pre-congestion marking from virtual queues will be a little higher
        than if the real queues had been used&mdash;still low, but more
        noticeable. But low congestion levels do not imply that usage <spanx
        style="emph">charges</spanx> must also be low. Usage charges will
        depend on the <spanx style="emph">price</spanx> L as well.</t>

        <t>If the metric of the usage element of an interconnection agreement
        was changed from pure volume to pre-congested volume, one would expect
        the price of pre-congestion to be arranged so that the total usage
        charge remained about the same. So, if an average pre-congestion
        fraction turned out to be 1/1000, one would expect that the price L
        (per octet) of pre-congestion would be about 1000 times the previously
        used (per octet) price for volume. We should add that a switch to
        pre-congestion is unlikely to exactly maintain the same overall level
        of usage charges, but this argument will be approximately true,
        because usage charge will rise to at least the level the market finds
        necessary to push back against usage.</t>

        <t>From the above example it can be seen why a 1000x higher price will
        make operators become acutely sensitive to the congestion they cause
        in other networks, which is of course the desired effect; to encourage
        networks to <spanx style="emph">avoid</spanx> the congestion they
        allow their users to cause to others.</t>

        <t>If any network sends even one flow at higher rate, they will
        immediately have to pay proportionately more usage charges. Because
        there is no knowledge of reservations within the PCN-region, no
        interior router can police whether the rate of each flow is greater
        than each reservation. So the system doesn't truly emulate
        rate-policing of each flow. But there is no incentive to pack a higher
        rate into a reservation, because the charges are directly proportional
        to rate, irrespective of the reservations.</t>

        <t>However, if virtual queues start to fill on any path, even though
        real queues will still be able to provide low latency service,
        pre-congestion marking will rise fairly quickly. It may eventually
        reach the threshold where the ingress gateway would deny admission to
        new flows. If the ingress gateway cheats and continues to admit new
        flows, the affected virtual queues will rapidly fill, even though the
        real queues will still be little worse than they were when admission
        control should have been invoked. The ingress gateway will have to pay
        the penalty for such an extremely high pre-congestion level, so the
        pressure to invoke admission control should become unbearable.</t>

        <t>The above mechanisms protect against rational operators. In <xref
        target="repcn_Fail-safes" /> we discuss how networks can protect
        themselves from accidental or deliberate misconfiguration in
        neighbouring networks.</t>

      <section anchor="repcn_Sanctioning_Dishonest_Marking"
               title="Sanctioning Dishonest Marking">
        <t>As PCN traffic leaves the last network before the egress gateway
        (domain 'C' in <xref target="repcn_Fig_Policing_Framework" />) the RE
        blanking fraction should match the congestion marking fraction, when
        averaged over a sufficiently long duration (perhaps ~10s to allow a
        few rounds of feedback through regular signalling of new and refreshed
        reservations).</t>

        <t>To protect itself, domain 'C' should install a monitor at its
        egress. It aims to detect flows of PCN packets that are persistently
        negative. If flows are positive, domain 'C' need take no
        action&mdash;this simply means an upstream network must be paying more
        penalties than it needs to. <xref
        target="repcn_Alg_Sanction_Negative" /> gives a suggested algorithm
        for the monitor, meeting the criteria below. <list style="symbols">
            <t>It SHOULD introduce minimal false positives for honest
            flows;</t>

            <t>It SHOULD quickly detect and sanction dishonest flows (minimal
            false negatives);</t>

            <t>It MUST be invulnerable to state exhaustion attacks from
            malicious sources. For instance, if the dropper uses flow-state,
            it should not be possible for a source to send numerous packets,
            each with a different flow ID, to force the dropper to exhaust its
            memory capacity;</t>

            <t>If drop is used as a sanction, it SHOULD introduce sufficient
            loss in goodput so that malicious sources cannot play off losses
            in the egress dropper against higher allowed throughput.
            Salvatori&nbsp;<xref target="CLoop_pol" /> describes this attack,
            which involves the source understating path congestion then
            inserting forward error correction (FEC) packets to compensate
            expected losses.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note that the monitor operates on flows but with careful design we
        can avoid per-flow state. This is why we have been careful to ensure
        that all flows MUST start with a packet marked with the FNE codepoint.
        If a flow does not start with the FNE codepoint, a monitor is likely
        to treat it unfavourably. This risk makes it worth setting the FNE
        codepoint at the start of a flow, even though there is a cost to
        setting FNE (positive `worth').</t>

        <t>Starting flows with an FNE packet also means that a monitor will be
        resistant to state exhaustion attacks from other networks, as the
        monitor can then be designed to never create state unless an FNE
        packet arrives. And an FNE packet counts positive, so it will cost a
        lot for a network to send many of them.</t>

        <t>Monitor algorithms will often maintain a moving average across
        flows of the fraction of RE blanked packets. When maintaining an
        average across flows, a monitor MUST ignore packets with the FNE
        codepoint set. An ingress gateway sets the FNE codepoint when it does
        not have the benefit of feedback from the egress. So counting packets
        with FNE cleared would be likely to make the average unnecessarily
        positive, providing headroom (or should we say footroom?) for
        dishonest (negative) traffic.</t>

        <t>If the monitor detects a persistently negative flow, it could drop
        sufficient negative and neutral packets to force the flow to not be
        negative. This is the approach taken for the `egress dropper' in <xref
        target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />, but for the scenario in this
        memo, where everyone would expect everyone else to keep to the
        protocol, a management alarm SHOULD be raised on detecting
        persistently negative traffic and any automatic sanctions taken SHOULD
        be logged. Even if the chosen policy is to take no automatic action,
        the cause can then be investigated manually.</t>

        <t>Then all ingresses cannot understate downstream pre-congestion
        without their action being logged. So network operators can deal with
        offending networks at the human level, out of band. As a last resort,
        perhaps where the ingress gateway address seems to have been spoofed
        in the signalling, packets can be dropped. Drops could be focused on
        just sufficient packets in misbehaving flows to remove the negative
        bias while doing minimal harm.</t>

        <t>A future version of this memo may define a control message that
        could be used to notify an offending ingress gateway (possibly via the
        egress gateway) that it is sending persistently negative flows.
        However, we are aware that such messages could be used to test the
        sensitivity of the detection system, so currently we prefer silent
        sanctions.</t>

        <t>An extreme scenario would be where an ingress gateway (or set of
        gateways) mounted a DoS attack against another network. If their
        traffic caused sufficient congestion to lead to drop but they
        understated path congestion to avoid penalties for causing high
        congestion, the preferential drop recommendations in <xref
        target="repcn_Router_Forwarding_Behaviour" /> would at least ensure

                 title="Border Accounting Mechanisms">
          <t>One of the main design goals of re-PCN was for border security
          mechanisms to be as simple as possible, otherwise they would become
          the pinch-points that limit scalability of the whole internetwork.
          As the title of this memo suggests, we want to avoid per-flow
          processing at borders. We also want to keep to passive mechanisms
          that can monitor traffic in parallel to forwarding, rather than
          having to filter traffic inline&mdash;in series with forwarding. As
          data rates continue to rise, we suspect that all-optical
          interconnection between networks will soon be a requirement. So we
          want to avoid any new need for buffering (even though border
          filtering is current practice for other reasons, we don't want to
          make it even less likely that we will ever get rid of it).</t>

          <t>So far, we have been able to keep the border mechanisms simple,
          despite having had to harden them against some subtle attacks on the
          re-PCN design. The mechanisms are still passive and avoid per-flow
          processing, although we do use filtering as a fail-safe to
          temporarily shield against extreme events in other networks, such as
          accidental misconfigurations (<xref
          target="repcn_Fail-safes" />).</t>

          <t>The basic accounting mechanism at each border interface simply
          involves accumulating the volume of packets with positive worth
          (Re-PCT-Echo and FNE), and subtracting the volume of those with
          negative worth: AM(-1) and TM(-1). Even though this mechanism takes
          no regard of flows, over an accounting period (say a month) this
          subtraction will account for the downstream congestion caused by all
          the flows traversing the interface, wherever they come from, and
          wherever they go to. The two networks can agree to use this metric
          however they wish to determine some congestion-related penalty
          against the upstream network (see <xref
          target="repcn_Pre-requisite_Contract" /> for examples). Although the
          algorithm could hardly be simpler, it is spelled out using
          pseudo-code in <xref target="repcn_Bulk_Alg_Metering" />.</t>

          <!-- {ToDo: Replace the
        XML from here to just before "Note that the guiding principle..." with
        that in draft-briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-border-cheat-02a_fragment.xml} -->

          <t>Various attempts to subvert the re-ECN design have been made. In
          all cases their root cause is persistently negative flows. But,
          after describing these attacks we will show that we don't actually
          have to get rid of all persistently negative flows in order to
          thwart the attacks.</t>

          <t>In honest flows, downstream congestion is measured as positive
          minus negative volume. So if all flows are honest (i.e. not
          persistently negative), adding all positive volume and all negative
          volume without regard to flows will give an aggregate measure of
          downstream congestion. But such simple aggregation is only possible
          if no flows are persistently negative. Unless persistently negative
          flows are completely removed, they will reduce the aggregate measure
          of congestion. The aggregate may still be positive overall, but not
          as positive as it would have been had the negative flows been
          removed.</t>

          <t>In <xref target="repcn_Sanctioning_Dishonest_Marking" /> we
          discussed how to sanction traffic to remove, or at least to
          identify, persistently negative flows. But, even if the sanction for
          negative traffic is to discard it, unless it is discarded at the
          exact point it goes negative, it will wrongly subtract from
          aggregate downstream congestion, at least at any borders it crosses
          after it has gone negative but before it is discarded.</t>

          <t>We rely on sanctions to deter dishonest understatement of
          congestion. But even the ultimate sanction of discard can only be
          effective if the sender is bothered about the data getting through
          to its destination. A number of attacks have been identified where a
          sender gains from sending dummy traffic or it can attack someone or
          something using dummy traffic even though it isn't communicating any
          information to anyone: <list style="symbols">
              <t>A network can simply create its own dummy traffic to congest
              another network, perhaps causing it to lose business at no cost
              to the attacking network. This is a form of denial of service
              perpetrated by one network on another. The preferential drop
              measures in <xref target="repcn_Router_Forwarding_Behaviour" />
              provide crude protection against such attacks, but we are not
              overly worried about more accurate prevention measures, because
              it is already possible for networks to DoS other networks on the
              general Internet, but they generally don't because of the grave
              consequences of being found out. We are only concerned if re-PCN
              increases the motivation for such an attack, as in the next
              example.</t>

              <t>A network can just generate negative traffic and send it over
              its border with a neighbour to reduce the overall penalties that
              it should pay to that neighbour. It could even initialise the
              TTL so it expired shortly after entering the neighbouring
              network, reducing the chance of detection further downstream.
              This attack need not be motivated by a desire to deny service
              and indeed need not cause denial of service. A network's main
              motivator would most likely be to reduce the penalties it pays
              to a neighbour. But, the prospect of financial gain might tempt
              the network into mounting a DoS attack on the other network as
              well, given the gain would offset some of the risk of being
              detected.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Note that we have not included DoS by Internet hosts in the above
          list of attacks, because we have restricted ourselves to a scenario
          with edge-to-edge admission control across a PCN-region. In this
          case, the edge ingress gateways insulate the PCN-region from DoS by
          Internet hosts. Re-ECN resists more general DoS attacks, but this is
          discussed in <xref target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />.</t>

          <t>The first step towards a solution to all these problems with
          negative flows is to be able to estimate the contribution they make
          to downstream congestion at a border and to correct the measure
          accordingly. Although ideally we want to remove negative flows
          themselves, perhaps surprisingly, the most effective first step is
          to cancel out the polluting effect negative flows have on the
          measure of downstream congestion at a border. It is more important
          to get an unbiased estimate of their effect, than to try to remove
          them all. A suggested algorithm to give an unbiased estimate of the
          contribution from negative flows to the downstream congestion
          measure is given in <xref
          target="repcn_Inflation_Negative_Flows" />.</t>

          <t>Although making an accurate assessment of the contribution from
          negative flows may not be easy, just the single step of neutralising
          their polluting effect on congestion metrics removes all the gains
          networks could otherwise make from mounting dummy traffic attacks on
          each other. This puts all networks on the same side (only with
          respect to negative flows of course), rather than being pitched
          against each other. The network where a flow goes negative as well
          as all the networks downstream lose out from not being reimbursed
          for any congestion this flow causes. So they all have an interest in
          getting rid of these negative flows. Networks forwarding a flow
          before it goes negative aren't strictly on the same side, but they
          are disinterested bystanders&mdash;they don't care that the flow
          goes negative downstream, but at least they can't actively gain from
          making it go negative. The problem becomes localised so that once a
          flow goes negative, all the networks from where it happens and
          beyond downstream each have a small problem, each can detect it has
          a problem and each can get rid of the problem if it chooses to. But
          negative flows can no longer be used for any new attacks.</t>

          <t>Once an unbiased estimate of the effect of negative flows can be
          made, the problem reduces to detecting and preferably removing flows
          that have gone negative as soon as possible. But importantly,
          complete eradication of negative flows is no longer
          critical&mdash;best endeavours will be sufficient.</t>

          <t>Note that the guiding principle behind all the above discussion
          is that any gain from subverting the protocol should be precisely
          neutralised, rather than punished. If a gain is punished to a
          greater extent than is sufficient to neutralise it, it will most
          likely open up a new vulnerability, where the amplifying effect of
          the punishment mechanism can be turned on others.</t>

          <t>For instance, if possible, flows should be removed as soon as
          they go negative, but we do NOT RECOMMEND any attempts to discard
          such flows further upstream while they are still positive. Such
          over-zealous push-back is unnecessary and potentially dangerous.
          These flows have paid their `fare' up to the point they go negative,
          so there is no harm in delivering them that far. If someone
          downstream asks for a flow to be dropped as near to the source as
          possible, because they say it is going to become negative later, an
          upstream node cannot test the truth of this assertion. Rather than
          have to authenticate such messages, re-PCN has been designed so that
          flows can be dropped solely based on locally measurable evidence. A
          message hinting that a flow should be watched closely to test for
          negativity is fine. But not a message that claims that a positive
          flow will go negative later, so it should be dropped.</t>

        <section anchor="repcn_Competitive_Routing"
                 title="Competitive Routing">
          <t>With the above penalty system, each domain seems to have a
          perverse incentive to fake pre-congestion. For instance domain 'B'
          profits from the difference between penalties it receives at its
          ingress (its revenue) and those it pays at its egress (its cost). So
          if 'B' overstates internal pre-congestion it seems to increase its
          profit. However, we can assume that domain 'A' could bypass 'B',
          routing through other domains to reach the egress. So the
          competitive discipline of least-cost routing can ensure that any
          domain tempted to fake pre-congestion for profit risks losing <spanx
          style="emph">all</spanx> its incoming traffic. The least congested
          route would eventually be able to win this competitive game, only as
          long as it didn't declare more fake pre-congestion than the next
          most competitive route.</t>

          <t>The competitive effect of interdomain routing might be weaker
          nearer to the egress. For instance, 'C' may be the only route 'B'
          can take to reach the ultimate receiver. And if 'C' over-penalises
          'B', the egress gateway and the ultimate receiver seem to have no
          incentive to move their terminating attachment to another network,
          because only 'B' and those upstream of 'B' suffer the higher
          penalties. However, we must remember that we are only looking at the
          money flows at the unidirectional network layer. There are likely to
          be all sorts of higher level business models constructed over the
          top of these low level 'sender-pays' penalties. For instance, we
          might expect a session layer charging model where the session
          originator pays for a pair of duplex flows, one as receiver and one
          as sender. Traditionally this has been a common model for telephony
          and we might expect it to be used, at least sometimes, for other
          media such as video. Wherever such a model is used, the data
          receiver will be directly affected if its sessions terminate through
          a network like 'C' that fakes congestion to over-penalise 'B'. So
          end-customers will experience a direct competitive pressure to
          switch to cheaper networks, away from networks like 'C' that try to
          over-penalise 'B'.</t>

          <t>This memo does not need to standardise any particular mechanism
          for routing based on re-PCN. Goldenberg et al&nbsp;<xref
          target="Smart_rtg" /> refers to various commercial products and
          presents its own algorithms for moving traffic between multi-homed
          routes based on usage charges. None of these systems require any
          changes to standards protocols because the choice between the
          available border gateway protocol (BGP) routes is based on a
          combination of local knowledge of the charging regime and local
          measurement of traffic levels. If, as we propose, charges or
          penalties were based on the level of re-PCN measured locally in
          passing traffic, a similar optimisation could be achieved without
          requiring any changes to standard routing protocols.</t>

          <t>We must be clear that applying pre-congestion-based routing to
          this admission control system remains an open research issue.
          Traffic engineering based on congestion requires careful damping to
          avoid oscillations, and should not be attempted without adult
          supervision :) Mortier &amp; Pratt&nbsp;<xref target="ECN-BGP" />
          have analysed traffic engineering based on congestion. But without
          the benefit of re-ECN or re-PCN, they had to add a path attribute to
          BGP to advertise a route's downstream congestion (actually they
          proposed that BGP should advertise the charge for congestion, which
          we believe wrongly embeds an assumption into BGP that the only thing
          to do with congestion is charge for it).</t>

          <t>The mechanisms described so far create incentives for rational
          operators to behave. That is, one operator aims to make another
          behave responsibly by applying penalties and expects a rational
          response (i.e. one that trades off costs against benefits). It is
          usually reasonable to assume that other network operators will
          behave rationally (policy routing can avoid those that might not).
          But this approach does not protect against the misconfigurations and
          accidents of other operators.</t>

          <t>Therefore, we propose the following two mechanisms at a network's
          borders to provide "defence in depth". Both are similar: <list

              interface. Then subsequent packets matching the same source and
              destination address and DSCP should be monitored. If the
              fraction of positive marking is well above a threshold (to be
              determined by operational practice), a management alarm SHOULD
              be raised, and the flow MAY be automatically subject to focused
              drop.</t>

              <t hangText="Persistently negative flows:">A small sample of
              congestion marked packets should be picked randomly as they
              cross a border interface. Then subsequent packets matching the
              same source and destination address and DSCP should be
              monitored. If the RE blanking fraction minus the congestion
              marking fraction is persistently negative, a management alarm
              SHOULD be raised, and the flow MAY be automatically subject to
              focused drop.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Both these mechanisms rely on the fact that highly positive (or
          negative) flows will appear more quickly in the sample by selecting
          randomly solely from positive (or negative) packets.</t>

          <t>Note that there is no assumption that <spanx
          style="emph">users</spanx> behave rationally. The system is
          protected from the vagaries of irrational user behaviour by the
          ingress gateways, which transform internal penalties into a
          deterministic, admission control mechanism that prevents users from
          misbehaving, by directly engineered means.</t>

    <!-- ================================================================ -->

    <section anchor="repcn_Analysis" title="Analysis">
      <t>The domains in <xref target="repcn_Fig_Scenario" /> are not expected
      to be completely malicious towards each other. After all, we can assume
      that they are all co-operating to provide an internetworking service to
      the benefit of each of them and their customers. Otherwise their routing
      polices would not interconnect them in the first place. However, we
      assume that they are also competitors of each other. So a network may
      try to contravene our proposed protocol if it would gain or make a
      competitor lose, or both. But only if it can do so without being caught.
      Therefore we do not have to consider every possible random attack one
      network could launch on the traffic of another, given anyway one network
      can always drop or corrupt packets that it forwards on behalf of
      another.</t>

      <t>Therefore, we only consider new opportunities for <spanx
      style="emph">gainful</spanx> attack that our proposal introduces. But to
      a certain extent we can also rely on the in depth defences we have
      described (<xref target="repcn_Fail-safes" /> ) intended to mitigate the
      potential impact if one network accidentally misconfiguring the workings
      of this protocol.</t>

      <t>The ingress and egress gateways are shown in the most generic
      arrangement possible in <xref target="repcn_Fig_Scenario" />, without
      any surrounding network. This allows us to consider more specific cases
      where these gateways and a neighbouring network are operated by the same
      player. As well as cases where the same player operates neighbouring
      networks, we will also consider cases where the two gateways collude as
      one player and where the sender and receiver collude as one. Collusion
      of other sets of domains is less likely, but we will consider such
      cases. In the general case, we will assume none of the nine trust
      domains across the figure fully trust any of the others.</t>

      <t>As we only propose to change routers within the PCN-region, we assume
      the operators of networks outside the region will be doing per-flow
      policing. That is, we assume the networks outside the PCN-region and the
      gateways around its edges can protect themselves. So given we are
      proposing to remove flow policing from some networks, our primary
      concern must be to protect networks that don't do per-flow policing (the
      potential `victims') from those that do (the `enemy'). The ingress and
      egress gateways are the only way the outer enemy can get at the middle
      victim, so we can consider the gateways as the representatives of the
      enemy as far as domains 'A', 'B' and 'C' are concerned. We will call
      this trust scenario `edges against middles'.</t>

      <!--    <t>The general arrangement is similar to Intserv over Diffserv&nbsp;<xref target="RFC2998" /> with per-flow reservation processing outside the PCN-region, but interior routers within it configured to ignore flow signalling. Exactly how per-flow reservations are achieved in the outer region is not of particular concern. To be concrete, we take Intserv&nbsp;<xref target="RFC1633" /> as the architecture of the outer per-flow region, but other architectures may be used such as proprietary bandwidth brokers or some future signalling architecture such as NSIS&nbsp;<xref target="RFC4080" />, or perhaps some hybrid of these. 
    </t>
-->

      <t>Earlier in this memo, we outlined the classic border rate policing
      problem (<xref target="repcn_Problem" />). It will now be useful to
      reiterate the motivations that are the root cause of the problem. The
      more reservations a gateway can allow, the more revenue it receives. The
      middle networks want the edges to comply with the admission control
      protocol when they become so congested that their service to others
      might suffer. The middle networks also want to ensure the edges cannot
      steal more service from them than they are entitled to.</t>

      <t>In the context of this `edges against middles' scenario, the re-PCN
      protocol has two main effects: <list style="symbols">
          <t>The more pre-congestion there is on a path across the PCN-region,
          the higher the ingress gateway must declare downstream
          pre-congestion.</t>

          <t>If the ingress gateway does not declare downstream pre-congestion
          high enough on average, it will `hit the ground before the runway',
          going negative and triggering sanctions, either directly against the
          traffic or against the ingress gateway at a management level</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>An executive summary of our security analysis can be stated in three
      parts, distinguished by the type of collusion considered. <list
          style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Neighbour-only Middle-Middle Collusion:">Here there is
          no collusion or collusion is limited to neighbours in the feedback
          loop. In other words, two neighbouring networks can be assumed to
          act as one. Or the egress gateway might collude with domain 'C'. Or
          the ingress gateway might collude with domain 'A'. Or ingress and
          egress gateways might collude with each other.<vspace
          blankLines="1" />In these cases where only neighbours in the
          feedback loop collude, we concludes that all parties have a positive
          incentive to declare downstream pre-congestion truthfully, and the
          ingress gateway has a positive incentive to invoke admission control
          when congestion rises above the admission threshold in any network
          in the region (including its own). No party has an incentive to send
          more traffic than declared in reservation signalling (even though
          only the gateways read this signalling). In short, no party can gain
          at the expense of another.</t>

          <t hangText="Non-neighbour Middle-Middle Collusion:">In the case of
          other forms of collusion between middle networks (e.g. between
          domain 'A' and 'C') it would be possible for say 'A' &amp; 'C' to
          create a tunnel between themselves so that 'A' would gain at the
          expense of 'B'. But 'C' would then lose the gain that 'A' had made.
          Therefore the value to 'A' &amp; 'C' of colluding to mount this
          attack seems questionable. It is made more questionable, because the
          attack can be statistically detected by 'B' using the second
          `defence in depth' mechanism mentioned already. Note that 'C' can
          defend itself from being attacked through a tunnel by treating the
          tunnel end point as a direct link to a neighbouring network (e.g. as
          if 'A' were a neighbour of 'C', via the tunnel), which falls back to
          the safety of the neighbour-only scenario.</t>

    <section anchor="repcn_Deployment" title="Incremental Deployment">
      <t>We believe ECN has so far not been widely deployed because it
      requires end system and widespread network deployment just to achieve a
      marginal improvement in performance. The ability to offer a new service
      (admission control) would be a much stronger driver for ECN
      deployment.</t>

      <t>As stated in the introduction, the aim of this memo is to "Design in
      security from the start" when admission control is based on
      pre-congestion notification. The proposal has been designed so that
      security can be added some time after first deployment, but only if the
      PCN wire protocol encoding is defined with the foresight to accommodate
      the extended set of codepoints defined in this document. Given admission
      control based on pre-congestion notification requires few changes to
      standards, it should be deployable fairly soon. However, re-PCN requires
      a change to IP, which may take a little longer :)</t>

      <t>We expect that initial deployments of PCN-based admission control
      will be confined to single networks, or to clubs of networks that trust
      each other. The proposal in this memo will only become relevant once
      networks with conflicting interests wish to interconnect their admission
      controlled services, but without the scalability constraints of per-flow
      border policing. It will not be possible to use re-PCN, even in a
      controlled environment between consenting operators, unless it is
      standardised into IP. Given the IPv4 header has limited space for
      further changes, current IESG policy <xref target="RFC4727" /> is not to
      allow experimental use of codepoints in the IPv4 header, as whenever an
      experiment isn't taken up, the space it used tends to be impossible to
      reclaim. Therefore, for IPv4 at least, we will need to find a way to run
      an experiment so that the header fields it uses can be reclaimed if the
      experiment is not a success.</t>

      <t>If PCN-based admission control is deployed before re-PCN is
      standardised into IP, wherever a network (or club of networks) connects
      to another network (or club of networks) with conflicting interests,
      they will place a gateway between the two regions that does per-flow
      rate policing and admission control. If re-PCN is eventually
      standardised into IP, it will be possible for these separate regions to
      upgrade all their ingress gateways to support re-PCN before removing the
      per-flow policing gateways between them. Given the edge-to-edge
      deployment model of PCN-based admission control, it is reasonable to
      expect incremental deployment of re-PCN will be feasible on a domain-by
      domain basis, without needing to cater for partial deployment of re-PCN
      in just some of the gateways around one PCN-domain.</t>

      <t>Nonetheless, if the upgrade of one ingress gateway is accidentally
      overlooked, the RE flag has been defined the safe way round for the
      default legacy behaviour (leaving RE cleared as <spanx
      style="verb">0</spanx>). A legacy ingress will appear to be declaring a
      high level of pre-congestion into the aggregate. The fail-safe border
      mechanism in <xref target="repcn_Fail-safes" /> might trigger management
      alarms (which would help in tracking down the need to upgrade the
      ingress), but all packets would continue to be delivered safely, as
      overstatement of downstream congestion requires no sanction.</t>

      <t>Only the ingress edge gateways around a PCN-region have to be
      upgraded to add re-PCN support, not interior routers. It is also
      necessary to add the mechanisms that monitor re-PCN to secure a network
      against misbehaving gateways and networks. Specifically, these are the
      border mechanisms (<xref target="repcn_Border_Mechanisms" />) and the
      mechanisms to sanction dishonest marking (<xref
      target="repcn_Sanctioning_Dishonest_Marking" />).</t>

      <t>We also RECOMMEND adding improvements to forwarding on interior
      routers (<xref target="repcn_Router_Forwarding_Behaviour" />). But the
      system works whether all, some or none are upgraded, so interior routers
      may be upgraded in a piecemeal fashion at any time.</t>

    benefits when deployed unilaterally by one network operator, without

    the benefits to individual networks are immediate and considerable.} -->

    <!-- {ToDo: can I reveal these results? For instance, an internal BT

    <section anchor="repcn_Rationale" title="Design Choices and Rationale">
      <t>The primary insight of this work is that downstream congestion is the
      metric that would be most useful to control an internetwork, and
      particularly to police how one network responds to the congestion it
      causes in a remote network. This is the problem that has previously made
      it so hard to provide scalable admission control.</t>

      <t>The case for using re-feedback (a generalisation of re-ECN) to police
      congestion response and provide QoS is made in <xref target="Re-fb" />.
      Essentially, the insight is that congestion is a factor that crosses
      layers from the physical upwards. Therefore re-feedback polices
      congestion as it crosses the physical interface between networks. This
      is achieved by bringing information about congestion of resources later
      on the path to the interface, rather than trying to deal with congestion
      where it happens by examining the notoriously unreliable source address
      in packets. Then congestion crossing the physical interface at a border
      can be policed at the interface, rather than policing the congestion on
      packets that claim to come from an address (which may be spoofed). Also,
      re-feedback works in the network layer independently of other
      layers&mdash;despite its name re-feedback does not actually require
      feedback. It makes a source to act conservatively before it gets
      feedback.</t>

      <t>On the subject of lack of feedback, the feedback not established
      (FNE) codepoint is motivated by arguments for a state set-up bit in IP
      to prevent state exhaustion attacks. This idea was first put forward
      informally by David Clark and developed by Handley and Greenhalgh in
      <xref target="Steps_DoS" />. The idea is that network layer datagrams
      should signal explicitly when they require state to be created in the
      network layer or the layer above (e.g. at flow start). Then a node can
      refuse to create any state unless a datagram declares this intent. We
      believe the proposed FNE codepoint serves the same purpose as the
      proposed state set-up bit, but it has been overloaded with a more
      specific purpose, using it on more packets than just the first in a
      flow, but never less (i.e. it is idempotent). In effect the FNE
      codepoint serves the purpose of a `soft-state set-up codepoint'.</t>

      <t>The re-feedback paper&nbsp;<xref target="Re-fb" /> also makes the
      case for converting the economic interpretation of congestion into hard
      engineering mechanism, which is the basis of the approach used in this
      memo. The admission control gateways around the PCN-region use hard
      engineering, not incentives, to prevent end users from sending more
      traffic than they have reserved. Incentive-based mechanisms are only
      used between networks, because they are expected to respond to
      incentives more rationally than end-users can be expected to. However,
      even then, a network can use fail-safes to protect itself from
      excessively unusual behaviour by neighbouring networks, whether due to
      an accidental misconfiguration or malicious intent.</t>

      <t>The guiding principle behind the incentive-based approach used
      between networks is that any gain from subverting the protocol should be
      precisely neutralised, rather than punished. If a gain is punished to a
      greater extent than is sufficient to neutralise it, it will most likely
      open up a new vulnerability, where the amplifying effect of the
      punishment mechanism can be turned on others.</t>

      <t>The re-feedback paper also makes the case against the use of
      congestion charging to police congestion if it is based on classic
      feedback (where only upstream congestion is visible to network
      elements). It argues this would open up receiving networks to `denial of
      funds' attacks and would require end users to accept dynamic pricing
      (which few would).</t>

      <t>Re-PCN has been deliberately designed to simplify policing at the
      borders between networks. These trust boundaries are the critical
      pinch-points that will limit the scalability of the whole internetwork
      unless the overall design minimises the complexity of security functions
      at these borders. The border mechanisms described in this memo run
      passively in parallel to data forwarding and they do not require
      per-flow processing.</t>

    <section anchor="repcn_Security_Considerations"
             title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This whole memo concerns the security of a scalable admission control
      system. In particular the analysis section. Below some specific security
      issues are mentioned that did not belong elsewhere or which comment on
      the overall robustness of the security provided by the design.</t>

      <t>Firstly, we must repeat the statement of applicability in the
      analysis: that we only consider new opportunities for <spanx
      style="emph">gainful</spanx> attack that our proposal introduces,
      particularly if the attacker can avoid being identified. Despite only
      involving a few bits, there is sufficient complexity in the whole system
      that there are probably numerous possibilities for other attacks.
      However, as far as we are aware, none reap any benefit to the attacker.
      For instance, it would be possible for a downstream network to remove
      the congestion markings introduced by an upstream network, but it would
      only lose out on the penalties it could apply to a downstream
      network.</t>

      <t>When one network forwards a neighbouring network's traffic it will
      always be possible to cause damage by dropping or corrupting it.
      Therefore we do not believe networks would set their routing policies to
      interconnect in the first place if they didn't trust the other networks
      not to arbitrarily damage their traffic.</t>

      <t>Having said this, we do want to highlight some of the weaker parts of
      our argument. <list style="symbols">
          <t>We have argued that networks will be dissuaded from faking
          congestion marking by the possibility that upstream networks will
          route round them. As we have said, these arguments are based on
          fairly delicate assumptions and will remain fairly tenuous until
          proved in practice, particularly close to the egress where less
          competitive routing is likely.</t>

          <t>Given the congestion feedback system is piggy-backed on flow
          signalling, which can be fairly infrequent, sanctions may not be
          appropriate until a flow has been persistently negative for perhaps
          20s. This may allow brief attacks to go unpunished. However,
          vulnerability to brief attacks may be reduced if the egress triggers
          asynchronous feedback when the congestion level on an aggregate has
          risen sufficiently since the last feedback, rather than waiting for
          the next opportunity to piggy-back on a signal.</t>

          <t>We should also point out that the approach in this memo was only
          designed to be robust for admission control. We do not claim the
          incentives will always be strong enough to force correct flow
          termination behaviour. This is because a user will tend to perceive
          much greater loss in value if a flow is terminated than if admission
          is denied at the start. However, in general the incentives for
          correct flow termination are similar to those for admission
          control.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Finally, it may seem that the 8 codepoints that have been made
      available by extending the ECN field with the RE flag have been used
      rather wastefully. In effect the RE flag has been used as an orthogonal
      single bit in nearly all cases. The only exception being when the ECN
      field is cleared to <spanx style="verb">00</spanx>. The mapping of the
      codepoints in an earlier version of this proposal used the codepoint
      space more efficiently, but the scheme became vulnerable to a network
      operator focusing its congestion marking to mark more positive than
      neutral packets in order to reduce its penalties (see Appendix B of
      <xref target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />).</t>

      <t>With the scheme as now proposed, once the RE flag is set or cleared
      by the sender or its proxy, it should not be written by the network,
      only read. So the gateways can detect if any network maliciously alters
      the RE flag. IPSec AH integrity checking does not cover the IPv4 option
      flags (they were considered mutable&mdash;even the one we propose using
      for the RE flag that was `currently unused' when IPSec was defined). But
      it would be sufficient for a pair of gateways to make random checks on
      whether the RE flag was the same when it reached the egress gateway as
      when it left the ingress. Indeed, if IPSec AH had covered the RE flag,
      any network intending to alter sufficient RE flags to make a gain would
      have focused its alterations on packets without authenticating headers
      (AHs).</t>

      <t>Therefore, no cryptographic algorithms have been exploited in the
      making of this proposal.</t>

    <section anchor="repcn_Conclusions" title="Conclusions">
      <t>This memo solves the classic problem of making flow admission control
      scale to any size network. It builds on a technique, called PCN, which
      involves the use of Diffserv in a domain and uses pre-congestion
      notification feedback to control admission into each network path across
      the domain <xref target="RFC5559" />.</t>

      <t>Without PCN, Diffserv requires over-provisioning that must grow
      linearly with network diameter to cater for variation in the traffic
      matrix. However, even with PCN, multiple network domains can only join
      together into one larger PCN region if all domains trust each other to
      comply with the protocols, invoking admission control and flow
      termination when requested. Domains could join together and still police
      flows at their borders by requiring reservation signalling to touch each
      border and only use PCN internally to each domain. But the per-flow
      processing at borders would still limit scalability.</t>

      <t>Instead, this memo proposes a technique called re-PCN which enables a
      PCN region to extend across multiple domains, without unscalable
      per-flow processing at borders, and still without the need for linear
      growth in capacity over-provisioning as the hop-diameter of the Diffserv
      region grows.</t>

      <t>We propose that the congestion feedback used for PCN-based admission
      control should be re-echoed into the forward data path, by making a
      trivial modification to the ingress gateway. We then explain how the
      resulting downstream pre-congestion metric in packets can be monitored
      in bulk at borders to sufficiently emulate flow rate policing.</t>

      <t>We claim the result of combining these two approaches is an admission
      control system that scales to any size network <spanx
      style="emph">and</spanx> any number of interconnected networks, even if
      they all act in their own interests.</t>

      <t>This proposal aims to convince its readers to "Design in Security
      from the start," by ensuring the PCN wire protocol encoding can
      accommodate the extended set of codepoints defined in this document,
      even if per-flow policing is used at first rather than the bulk border
      policing described here. This way, we will not build ourselves
      tomorrow's legacy problem.</t>

      <t>Re-echoing congestion feedback is based on a principled technique
      called Re-ECN&nbsp;<xref target="I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp" />,
      designed to add accountability for causing congestion to the
      general-purpose IP datagram service. Re-ECN proposes to consume the last
      completely unused bit in the basic IPv4 header or it uses extension
      header in IPv6.</t>

          <t>At the end of an accounting period this counter V_b represents
          the pre-congestion volume that penalties could be applied to, as
          described in <xref
          target="repcn_Pre-requisite_Contract"></xref>.</t>

          <t>For instance, accumulated volume of pre-congestion through a
          border interface over a month might be V_b = 5TB (terabyte = 10^12
          byte). This might have resulted from an average downstream
          pre-congestion level of 0.001% on an accumulated total data volume
          of B = 500PB (petabyte = 10^15 byte).</t>

        <section anchor="repcn_Inflation_Negative_Flows"
                 title="Inflation Factor for Persistently Negative Flows">
          <t>The following process is suggested to complement the simple
          algorithm above in order to protect against the various attacks from
          persistently negative flows described in <xref
          target="repcn_Border_Accounting_Mechanisms"></xref>. As explained in
          that section, the most important and first step is to estimate the
          contribution of persistently negative flows to the bulk volume of
          downstream pre-congestion and to inflate this bulk volume as if
          these flows weren't there. The process below has been designed to
          give an unbiased estimate, but it may be possible to define other
          processes that achieve similar ends.</t>

          <t>While the above simple metering algorithm (<xref
          target="repcn_Alg_Metering"></xref>) is counting the bulk of traffic
          over an accounting period, the meter should also select a subset of
          the whole flow ID space that is small enough to be able to
          realistically measure but large enough to give a realistic sample.
          Many different samples of different subsets of the ID space should
          be taken at different times during the accounting period, preferably
          covering the whole ID space. During each sample, the meter should
          count the volume of positive packets and subtract the volume of
          negative, maintaining a separate account for each flow in the
          sample. It should run a lot longer than the large majority of flows,
          to avoid a bias from missing the starts and ends of flows, which
          tend to be positive and negative respectively.</t>

          <t>Once the accounting period finishes, the meter should calculate
          the total of the accounts V_{bI} for the subset of flows I in the
          sample, and the total of the accounts V_{fI} excluding flows with a
          negative account from the subset I. Then the weighted mean of all
          these samples should be taken a_S = sum_{forall I} V_{fI} /
          sum_{forall I} V_{bI}.</t>

          <t>If V_b is the result of the bulk accounting algorithm over the
          accounting period (<xref target="repcn_Bulk_Alg_Metering"></xref>)
          it can be inflated by this factor a_S to get a good unbiased
          estimate of the volume of downstream congestion over the accounting
          period a_S.V_b, without being polluted by the effect of persistently
          negative flows.</t>

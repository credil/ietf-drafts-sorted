1.  Introduction

   TBD


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

    "atom": "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"


3.  The 'atom:to' element

   The atom:to element MAY be used as the child of an atom:entry element
   to identify an intended redistribution target for the atom:entry.
   The value of the atom:to element MUST be an IRI.  Processors that are
   redistributing copies of an atom:entry, SHOULD NOT remove any
   contained atom:to elements from the redistributed copy.

     to = element atom:to {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       (atomUri | "*")
     }

   An atom:entry element MAY contain any number of atom:to elements, but
   MUST NOT contain more than one with the same IRI value as sibling
   atom:to, atom:cc and atom:bcc elements.

   The value "*" MAY be used to indicate that the entry is intended to
   be redistributed to everyone.

   Processors that encounter IRI values in atom:to elements that cannot
   be resolved to a entity to which the atom:entry can be redistributed
   MUST NOT stop processing the entry.  However, such processors MAY
   signal an error or a warning to the client indicating that the IRI is
   being ignored.

4.  The 'atom:cc' element

   The atom:cc element MAY be used as the child of an atom:entry element
   to identify an intended redistribution target for the atom:entry.
   The value of the atom:cc element MUST be an IRI.  Processors that are
   redistributing copies of an atom:entry, SHOULD NOT remove any
   contained atom:cc elements from the redistributed copy.

     cc = element atom:cc {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       (atomUri | "*")
     }

   An atom:entry element MAY contain any number of atom:cc elements, but
   MUST NOT contain more than one with the same IRI value as sibling
   atom:to, atom:cc and atom:bcc elements.

   The value "*" MAY be used to indicate that the entry is intended to
   be redistributed to everyone.

   Processors that encounter IRI values in atom:cc elements that cannot
   be resolved to a entity to which the atom:entry can be redistributed
   MUST NOT stop processing the entry.  However, such processors MAY
   signal an error or a warning to the client indicating that the IRI is
   being ignored.

5.  The 'atom:bcc' element

   The atom:bcc element MAY be used as the child of an atom:entry
   element to identify an intended redistribution target for the atom:
   entry.  The value of the atom:to element MUST be an IRI.  Processors
   that are redistributing copies of an atom:entry, MUST remove all
   contained atom:bcc elements from the redistributed copy.  When
   redistributing an atom:entry containing atom:bcc elements, the
   processor MAY include an empty atom:bcc element within the
   redistributed copy as an indication to recipients that copies have
   been sent to an undisclosed set of recipients.

     bcc = element atom:bcc {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       (atomUri)
     }

   An atom:entry element MAY contain any number of atom:bcc elements,
   but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same IRI value as sibling
   atom:to, atom:cc or atom:bcc elements.

   Processors MUST ignore atom:bcc elements that use the reserved "*"
   value.

   Processors that encounter IRI values in atom:bcc elements that cannot
   be resolved to a entity to which the atom:entry can be redistributed
   MUST NOT stop processing the entry.  However, such processors MAY
   signal an error or a warning to the client indicating that the IRI is
   being ignored.

        ...
     </feed>


6.  IRI's and the 'xml:base' Attribute

   The atom:to and atom:bcc elements use IRIs [RFC3987].  Every URI
   [RFC3986] is also an IRI, so a URI may be used as the value of these
   elements.  When an IRI that is not also a URI is given for
   dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to a URI using the steps in Section
   3.1 of [RFC3987].

   The atom:to and atom:bcc elements MAY have an xml:base attribute
   [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627].  When xml:base is used, it serves the
   function described in section 5.1.1 of [RFC3986], establishing the
   base URI (or IRI) for resolving any relative references found within
   the effective scope of the xml:base attribute.


7.  Security Considerations

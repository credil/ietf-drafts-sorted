   Transmission of Compressed IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks
          draft-bouchet-transmission-of-compressed-ipv6-00


Abstract

   The document describes an IPv6 header compression format for
   transmission of IPv6 packets in 6LoWPAN networks. Specifications
   of the compression format rely on specific contexts for which the
   implementation of fragmentation and defragmentation/reassembly is not
   recommended. Specifications include frameworks for compressing and
   decompressing header as well as compression and decompression of
   source and destination addresses. This document complements
   "Compression Format for IPv6 Datagrams in 6LoWPAN Networks",
   [draft-ietf-6lowpan-hc-07].

1. Introduction

   It is increasingly common to notice several diverse areas of
   application in which a range of Low Power wireless Sensor
   Networks(WSN) is being deployed. If the current scale and growth
   of such deployments are any indication, it is likely that soon
   we would require very large scale internetwork of WSNs which may
   have to be connected to one or more global networks/internetworks.
   A reasonable number of such situations would likely benefit from
   a need based provisioning of relevant IP level communication
   capabilities where all the intervened nodes may have to
   have associated IP addresses. Since IPv4 is running out of its global
   address space even for conventional Internet based systems and
   applications it cannot be considered a viable IP addressing choice for
   such sensor networks and internetworks. Moreover, thanks to the
   computation capabilities of the WSN nodes, it may not benefit to have
   a dual stack kind of support (IPv6 and IPv4) provisioned. It is in
   this context that IPv6 Low Power Wireless Personal Area Network
   (6LoWPAN) assumes significance.

   The use cases of LoWPAN can be classified in three different 
   situations: an all-nodes fixed situation, an all-nodes mobile situation
   and an hybrid situation. This document presents a simple approach for
   realization of 6LoWPAN. It addresses situations where all the deployed
   nodes are fixed or immobile. These situations include data collecting
   and monitoring changes over period of time. Additional complementary
   draft might be written to cover the other situations.

   LoWPAN relies on standards including, but not limited, to the IEEE
   802.15.4-2003 standard [IEEE802.15.4]. This document has been prepared
   in such a manner that almost all the recommendations made herein remain
   generic in nature so as to allow the central recommendations to be
   easily adaptable to any future standard including future variants of
   IEEE 802.15.4. However some of the sample formats herein have been
   based on the existing IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard so as to make them
   immediately usable.

   This draft defines a mechanism of header compression keeping overheads
   as minimum as possible by making suitable assumptions, saving on
   computation and energy and providing more octets for data.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Problem Background

   IEEE 802.15.4 protocol specifies a maximum packet size of 127 octets.
   The physical layer imposes a maximum overhead of 25 octets leaving 102
   octets for media access control layer. Link-layer security has its own
   overhead, which in the maximum case (AES-CCM-128 case) is 21 octets
   leaving only 81 octets available. Furthermore, the IPv6 header is 40
   octets long, leaving only 41 octets for upper-layer protocols, like
   UDP. The latter uses 8 octets in the header which leaves only 33 octets
   for application data. The situation clearly emphasizes a need on header
   compression and fragmentation.
   The intensive use of fragmentation and reassembly would lead to an
   unnecessary waste of computational power and energy. Major problems
   faced with fragmentation and header compression include problems in the
   determination of a mechanism for fragments routing, complexity of the
   determination of fragment loss and recovery and ensuring that fragment
   offset remains unaffected by header compression. Use of Acknowledge/No
   Acknowledge signals could be employed to solve these problems (as
   reassembly will start once all packets have been received by the
   destination node) and would also ensure reliability. However this would
   lead to faster draining of battery due to overhead of Ack/NAck packet
   transfer.

   Thus, to avoid the use of fragmentation and reassembly, header
   compression needs to be reconsidered and certain features of IPv6 have
   to be elided or minimized.



3. IPv6 Compressed Header Format:

   This section specifies the format of the IPv6 compressed header. The
   remaining header is 6 octets long.

   bits to complete up the octet and can be assigned any random value.

   T: Traffic Class: 1 bit 
   0: No Priority
   1: High Priority
   It is further explained in Section No 10

   SO: Security Option: 2 bits
   00: No security 
   01: Authentication 
   10: Encryption
   11: Reserved
   It is further explained in Section No 11

   N: Next Header
   00: No Next Header
   01: UDP Header
   10: Routing Header
   11: Future uses
   Next Header is allocated 2 bits. Very few next header options are taken
   in their original form, while others have been modified or elided.
   See Section 9 for more details.

   L: Loose Source Routing 
   Loose Source Routing is assigned 1 bit. It is set to determine if the
   packet is sent as Routing Extension Header. More details can be found
   in Section 12.

   HL: Hop Limit
   Hop Limit is not modified and remains 8 bits long. Therefore a maximum
   of 255 hops can be made. Should this number become insufficient in the
   future, the UnReserved bits could be used.

   SA: Source Address
   Source Address is a 13-bit field. Address is configured as described in
   Section 7. Compression of 128-bit address to 13-bit address is
   detailed in Section 5.

   D: Destination Address Type
   0: Unicast
   1: Multicast
   Destination Address Type is a 1-bit field. It determines whether the
   address is of type Unicast or Multicast. 

   DA: Destination Address
   Destination Address is a 13-bit field. Address is configured as

   described in Section 7. Compression of 128-bit address to 13-bit
   address is detailed in Section 5.


4. IPv6 compression and expansion Algorithm

   This section describes how to compress the 40-octet long IPv6 header to
   its compressed 6-octet format and how to expend the compressed 6-octet
   format to a full 40-octet header. The algorithm elides some fields,
   which are assumed to remain common for 6LoWPAN communication: Version
   is 6; Flow Label is zero; Payload Length can be inferred from lower
   layers from the IEEE 802.15.4 header; Hop Limit will be set to a
   well-known value by the source, 128-bit IPv6 addresses are reduced to
   13-bit addresses. To this date, the largest 6LoWPAN network ever put
   together counted 800 nodes. A 13-bit address allows an 8000-node
   network to function. The addressing model is described in Section 5;
   the algorithms for address translation are described in Section 6.
 

4.1 Compression of 40 octets to 6 octets

   The following algorithm is used for the header compression:

   V = 40_octets_header[1-4] //Read the first 4 bits for checking the
   version

   if(V == 0100b) // It is an IPv4 address
          apply the IPv4toIPv6 algorithm

   6_octets_header[1-6] = 0000000b// setting the unreserved bits to 0

   if (traffic class != 0000 0000)
      6_octets_header[7]=1
   else
      6_octets_header[7]=0

   // Ignore the flow label

   P = 40_octets_header[32-47]// reading the payload length field.

   if(P< 0x0080h && P> 0x0000h )
       continue
   else
       discard the packet

   H = 40_octets_header[48-55] // reading the next header field

   while ( there exists a next header)
        if(H == 17) // if it is a UDP upper layer next header
           6octet[10-11] = 01 //set the 'N' to 01, the next header bits to 01

           6octet[10-11] = 00 //set the 'N' to 00, the next header bits to 00
        else if (H== 51)
           6octet[8-9] = 01 //set the security bits to 01
        else if (H==50 )
           6octet[8-9] = 10 //set the security bits to 10
        else if (H==43 )

                                                  //has already been not set by
     // considering the next header
	6octet[8-9] = 00 // set the security bits to 00

   if ( 6octet[12] != 1 ) //if the loose has already been not set by
      //considering the next header
      6octet[12] = 0 // set the loose source routing bit to 0

   L = 40_octets_header[56-63] //reading the hop limit field

   if( L < 0x00ffh && L > 0x0001h)
      6_octets_header[13-20] = L // set the hop limit accordingly
   else
      discard the packet

   6_octets_header[21-32] = SA // SA is formed by using the algorithm
   given in Section 5. Set Source Address derived from the algorithm.

   6_octets_header[33] = 0 or 1 // Decided by reading the 128 bit
   destination address.

   6_octet_header[34-46] = DA // DA is formed by using the algorithm given
   in Section 5.Set Source Address derived from the algorithm.

   As described in Section 9, few Extension Header are taken as they are,
   few have been elided completely while others are implemented with
   minimal functionalities.


4.3 Translation of IPv4 packet into IPv6 packet

   The following settings are to be used to translate an IPv4 packet into
   an IPv6 packet.

   Version = 6

   Traffic Class = IPv4 header TOS bits

   Flow Label = 0

   Payload Length = IPv4 header Total Length value + (IPv4 header length +
   IPv4 options length)

   Next Header = IPv4 header Protocol field value

   Hop Limit = IPv4 TTL field value - 1

   Source IP Address = 0:0:0:0:FFFF::/80 concatenated with IPv4 header
   source IP address 

   Destination IP Address = 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF::/96 concatenated with IPv4
   header destination IP address

   P: 5-bit 6LoWPAN prefix.
   This field indicates that the address is a 6LoWPAN address. This field
   is set to 11111b.

   SA: 13-bit Short Address.

5.2 13-bit Short Address

   The nodes within the network will have a 13-bit address. Also, 256
   addresses are reserved for machines outside the 6LoWPAN network. These
   addresses are designated by a 5-bit prefix 11111b.

6. Address Translation

   This section describes the translation of 128-bit addresses to 13-bit
   addresses and vice-versa. These algorithms require the implementation
   of a Translation table whose maximum size is 4kb.

6.1 Translation of a 128 bit address into a 13 bit address

   The following algorithm is used to translate a 128-bit regular IPv6
   address into a unique 13-bit address.

   P = 128bit_address[65 -69] // read the 5 bits from 65th to 69th.

   if(P == 11111b)
      Set the last 13 bits in Source/Destination Address field 
      //the same as the last 13 bits of the 128 bit address
   else
      Read the translation table

   if( 128-bit address is present in the table)
      set the corresponding 13 bit address in Source/Destination Address
      field
   else 
      put it in the table, assign it a 13 bit address and set the 13 bit
      address in Source/Destination field

6.2 Translation of a 13-bits address into a 128 bits address

   The following algorithm is used to translate a 13-bit address into a
   128-bit regular IPv6 address.

   F = 13bit_address[1-5] // read the 5 bits from 1st bit to 5th bit of
                             the 13 bit address.

   if(F == 11111b)
       read the translation table and set the correspondent 128-bit
       address in Source/Destination Address field
   else
       create the 128 bit address first 64 bits formed by concatenating
       the Global Prefix and SID,
       65th to 68th bit set to 1
       69th to 114th bits set to 0
       13-bit address is set in the 13 last bits of the 128-bit address

7. Communication between outside world and inside the WSN

   Consider a machine Ma, external to WSN network, which needs to
   communicate with a WSN node Wb, where 1<=a<=255; 1<=b<=2^13. Ma sends a
   request to the gateway to obtain the IPv6 address of the node Wb. The
   gateway sends the information to Ma.

   Ma sends a packet to Wb with the full 128 bits destination address.
   This packet is intercepted by the gateway which is the only way to
   reach the WSN. When the packet is received by the Gateway, the Gateway
   translates the message in a WSN packet : the header is compressed, the
   destination address is replaced by the 13-bit equivalent address and
   the 128-bit address of Ma is registered in a look-up table in the
   gateway. The gateway assigns a new 13-bit address to Ma which is
   registered in the look-up table and which corresponds to the 128-bit
   address of Ma. This 13-bit address is set in the Source Address Field.
   This address has a 11111-prefix in order to indicate that it
   corresponds to an outside machine. The translated message is then
   forwarded to Wb.
		 
   If Wb then needs to communicate with Ma, it sends a packet destined to
   Ma. This packet is intercepted by the gateway which translates the
   packet: the header is extended, the source address is replaced by a
   128-bit address using the algorithm describes above and the destination
   address is obtained by getting the 128-bit address which corresponds to
   the 13 bit-address in the look-up table. Then the packet is forwarded
   to the outside network.

8. Address Autoconfiguration

   The nodes will obtain their 13-bit address statelessly as soon as they
   power up. Their corresponding 128-bit addresses will have global scope
   and will be globally unique. Duplicate Address Detection will be
   performed to ensure that the 13-bit address obtained by the node is
   unique inside the WSN. If an assigned address is already in use, a new

   address will be taken up by the concerned node.

9. Next Header

   This section describes the Next Header mentioned in [RFC 2460] and IPv6
   Extension Headers Review and Consideration

9.1. Hop-by-Hop Options header

   The problem with the Hop-by-hop field is that it must be seen,
   understood and acted upon by every node, which is an unnecessary
   wastage of energy. The data collected and conveyed in the majority of
   real life applications through wireless sensor networks do not require
   any special processing in intermediate nodes that may benefit from the
   provisioning of the hop-by-hop Extension Header. Thus we do not
   recommend the implementation of the Hop-by-hop option. 

9.2. Routing header

   The Routing Header is expressed explicitly only as Loose Source Routing
   described in Section 12.

9.3. Authentication header

   The Authentication header is elided in its original form. ESP
   (Encapsulating Security Payload) covers all the functionalities that
   are to be carried out by an Authentication Header. In cases where only
   Authentication is needed, it is set in Security Bit described in
   Section 11.

9.4. Encapsulating Security Payload header

   Encryption and Decryption consume more resources in terms of power and
   processing. Thus, their use is not recommended. Only in cases where
   some high security is required, minimal functionalities can be
   implemented. See Section 11 for more details.

9.5 Destination Options Header

   Use of Destination Options is not recommended as the use of this
   extension header would lead to the extension of the packet size beyond
   MTU.

9.6 Fragment Header

   The use of this header is totally elided as fragmentation is totally

   avoided.

9.7 No Next Header

   No next header is explicitly mentioned by 00 and in original IPv6
   header it is denoted by 59.

9.8 Upper Layer Header

   The value 01 is use to denote upper layer header which means that the
   transportation protocol used is UDP (denoted by value 17 in the
   original IPv6 header). TCP, although being reliable, is not used as a
   transportation protocol as handshaking will result in sending more
   packets, thus draining more energy. 

10. Traffic Class

   The original IPv6 Header as received by the gateway may contain 8-bit
   traffic class and 20-bit flow label specifications. In that case, our
   recommendation mandates this 28-bit specification to be abstracted into
   two classes: time-sensitive and time-insensitive. Therefore, our header
   compression specification uses just 1 bit which may be set or unset to
   denote the time-sensitivity of the packet. This is in keeping in with
   the fact that in most of the practical WSN application scenarios, we
   seldom come across situations which may warrant a more complex handling
   of WSN traffic.

11. Security Option

   In most cases, WSN do not handle security sensitive data and hence
   implementing full fledged security as mentioned in RFC 4301, 4302 4303
   and 2460, would lead to an unnecessary waste of computation and battery
   drainage. Basic security can be provided by lower layers. However, in
   cases where additional security measures at IP layer are required, the
   need for authentication or encryption-decryption can be specified
   thanks to the Security Option.

12. Loose Source Routing

   Loose Source Routing is done to verify whether certain nodes are
   reachable from a particular source. In these cases, the payload could
   only contain addresses and nothing else. In cases where the content of
   the packet is more sensitive and as an additional security measure,
   payload data can be also be present along with the addresses. This is
   to ensure that the packet reaches its destination via a safe and known
   path. For this purpose some bits can be used from the UnReserved set of

   bits to specify the number of addresses present, some octets from the
   payload can also be taken up as an alternate. It is necessary to ensure
   that doing this SHOULD NOT lead to fragmentation.

13. Constraints:

   a.) The Hop Limit implies a restriction of 255 hops. Should this number
   become insufficient in the future; the UnReserved bits could be used.

14. Consequences:

   a.) Number of octets left for Payload are 67.

15. Security Considerations:

   The scenarios considered in this draft have a low-security level. The
   recommendations given in this draft are not valid for sensitive
   scenarios.

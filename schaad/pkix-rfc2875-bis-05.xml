      <t>This document describes two methods for producing an integrity check
        value from a Diffie-Hellman key pair and one method for producing an integrity check value from an Elliptic Curve key pair.  This behavior is needed for
        such operations as creating the signature of a PKCS #10 certification
        request.  These algorithms are designed to provide a proof-of-possession rather than general purpose signing.

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>
        PKCS #10 <xref target="RFC2986"/> and the Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) <xref target="CRMF"/> define syntaxes for certification requests.
        While CRMF supports an alternative method to support Proof-of-Possession (POP) for encryption-only keys, PKCS #10 does not.
        PKCS #10 assumes that the public key being requested for certification corresponds to an algorithm that is capable of producing a POP by a signing/encrypting operation.
        Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) are key agreement algorithms and as such cannot be directly used for signing or encryption.</t>

      <t>
        This document describes new proof-of-possession algorithms.
        Two methods use the Diffie-Hellman key agreement process to provide a shared secret as the basis of an integrity check value and one method uses the Elliptic-Curve key agreement process.
        In the first and third algorithm, the value is constructed for a specific recipient/verifier by using a public key of that verifier.
        In the second algorithm, the value is constructed for arbitrary verifiers.</t>

      <t>
        It should be noted that we did not create an algorithm that parallels ECDSA (Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) like was done for DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm).
        Given the current PKIX definitions for the public key parameters of elliptic curve, the number of groups is both limited and predefined.
        This means that the probability that the same set of parameters are going to be used by the key requester and the key validator would be high.
        Also since the group verification has been done centrally and with lots of validation, the odds that a cryptographically weak group is used are much reduced.
        Additionally, any system which could compute such a parallel algorithm would just be able to use the ECDSA algorithm in any event.</t>

    <section title="Static DH Proof-of-Possession Process" anchor="dh-static">
      <t>The Static DH POP algorithm is set up to use a key derivation function (KDF) and a message authentication code (MAC).  This algorithm requires that a common set of group parameters be used by both the creator and verifier of the POP value. </t>

      <t>   The steps for creating a DH POP are:

        <list style="numbers">

          <t>An entity (E) chooses the group parameters for a DH key agreement.

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>

            This is done simply by selecting the group parameters from a certificate for the recipient of the POP process.

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>

            A certificate with the correct group parameters has to be available. Let these common DH parameters be g and p; and let this DH key-pair be known as the Recipient key pair (Rpub and Rpriv).

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>

            Rpub = g^x mod p    (where x=Rpriv, the private DH value)
          </t>

          <t> The entity generates a DH public/private key-pair using the parameters from step 1.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            For an entity E:
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            Epriv = DH private value = y
            <vspace blankLines='0'/>
            Epub  = DH public value  = g^y mod p
          </t>

          <t> The POP computation process will then consist of:
            <list style="format %c)">
              <t> The value to be signed (text) is obtained. (For a PKCS #10 object, the value is the DER encoded certificationRequestInfo field represented as an octet string.)</t>

              <t> A shared DH secret is computed, as follows,

                <vspace blankLines='1'/>

                shared secret = ZZ = g^(x*y) mod p

                <vspace blankLines='1'/>

                [This is done by the entity E as Rpub^y and by the Recipient as Epub^x, where Rpub is retrieved from the Recipient's DH certificate (or is provided in the protocol) and Epub is retrieved from the actual certification request.]</t>

              <t>A temporary key K is derived from the shared secret ZZ as follows:
                <list style="empty">
                  <t>K = KDF(LeadingInfo | ZZ | TrailingInfo)</t>
                  <t>LeadingInfo ::= Subject Distinguished Name from certificate</t>
                  <t>TrailingInfo ::= Issuer Distinguished Name from certificate</t>
                </list>
              </t>
              
              <t> Using the defined MAC function, compute MAC(K, text).</t>
              
            </list>
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The POP verification process requires the Recipient to carry out steps (a) through (d) and then simply compare the result of step (d) with what it received as the signature component. If they match then the following can be concluded:

        <list style="format %c)">

          <t> The Entity possesses the private key corresponding to the
            public key in the certification request because it needed the
            private key to calculate the shared secret; and</t>

          <t> Only the Recipient that the entity sent the request to could
            actually verify the request because it would require its
            own private key to compute the same shared secret. In the case
            where the recipient is a Certification Authority, this
            protects the Entity from rogue CAs.</t>
        </list>

      </t>

      <section title="ASN.1 Encoding">

        <t>The algorithm outlined above allows for the use of an arbitrary hash function in computing the temporary key and the MAC value.   In this specification we define object identifiers for the SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 hash values.  The ASN.1 structures associated with the static Diffie-Hellman POP algorithm are:</t>

      <t>The use of a single set of parameters for an entire public key
        infrastructure allows all keys in the group to be attacked together.</t>

      <t>For this reason we need to create a proof-of-possession for Diffie-Hellman keys that does not require the use of a common set of parameters.</t>

      <t>
        This POP is based on the Digital Signature Algorithm, but we have removed the restrictions dealing with the hash and key sizes imposed by the [FIPS-186] standard.
        The use of this method does impose some additional restrictions on the set of keys that may be used, however if the key generation algorithm documented in <xref target="RFC2631"/> is used the required restrictions are met.
        The additional restrictions are the requirement for the existence of a q parameter. Adding the q parameter is generally accepted as a good practice as it allows for checking of small subgroup attacks.
      </t>

      <t>The following definitions are used in the rest of this section:</t>

<!-- RFC Editor - Please perserve indentation below in the output. -->
      <t>

      <vspace blankLines='0'/>
      g = h^((p-1)/q) mod p ,

         where h is any integer 1 &lt; h &lt; p-1 such that h^((p-1)/q) mod q &gt; 1
      <vspace blankLines='0'/>
         (g has order q mod p)
      <vspace blankLines='0'/>
      q is a large prime
      <vspace blankLines='0'/>
      j is a large integer such that p = q*j + 1

      b = the output size of HASH in bits
      </t>

      <t>Note: These definitions match the ones in <xref target="RFC2631"/>.</t>

      <section title="Expanding the Digest Value">

        <t>
          Besides the addition of a q parameter, [FIPS-186] also imposes size restrictions on the parameters.
          The length of q must be 160 bits (matching the output length of the SHA-1 digest algorithm) and the length of p must be 1024 bits.
          The size restriction on p is eliminated in this document, but the size restriction on q is replaced with the requirement that q must be at least b bits in length.
          (If the hash function is SHA-1, then b=160 bits and the size restriction on b is identical with that in <xref target="FIPS-186"/>.)
        </t>

        <t>
          Given that there is not a random length-hashing algorithm, a hash value of the message will need to be derived such that the hash is in the range from 0 to q-1.
          If the length of q is greater than b then a method must be provided to expand the hash.
        </t>

        <t>
          The method for expanding the digest value used in this section does not add any additional security beyond the b bits provided by the hash algorithm.
          The value being signed is increased mainly to enhance the difficulty of reversing the signature process.

    <section title="Static ECDH Proof-of-Possession Process" anchor="ecdh-static">
      <t>
      The Static ECDH POP algorithm is set up to use a key derivation function (KDF) and a message authentication code (MAC).  This algorithm requires that a common set of group parameters be used by both the creator and verifier of the POP value. Full details of how Elliptic Curve Cryptography works can be found in RFC 6090 <xref target="RFC6090"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        The steps for creating an ECDH POP are:

        <list style="numbers">
          
          <t>
            An entity (E) chooses the group parameters for an ECDH key agreement.
          
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>

            This is done simply by selecting the group parameters from a certificate for the recipient of the POP process.

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>

            A certificate with the correct group parameters has to be available. The ECDH parameters can be identified either by a named group or by a set of curve parameters.  Section 2.3.5 of RFC 3279 <xref target="RFC3279"/> documents how the parameters are encoded for PKIX certificates.  For PKIX-based applications, the parameters will almost always be defined by a named group.  Designate G as the group from the ECDH parameters.  Let the ECDH key-pair associated with the certificate be known as the Recipient key pair (Rpub and Rpriv).

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>

            Rpub = Rpriv * G
          </t>

          <t> The entity generates an ECDH public/private key-pair using the parameters from step 1.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            For an entity E:
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            Epriv = Entity private value
            <vspace blankLines='0'/>
            Epub  = ECDH public point  = Epriv * G
          </t>
          
          <t> The POP computation process will then consist of:
          
            <list style="format %c)">
              
              <t> The value to be signed (text) is obtained. (For a PKCS #10 object, the value is the DER encoded certificationRequestInfo field represented as an octet string.)</t>

              <t> A shared ECDH secret is computed, as follows,

                <vspace blankLines='1'/>

                shared secret point (x, y) = Epriv * Rpub = Rpriv * Epub
              
                <vspace blankLines='1'/>
                
                shared secret value ZZ is the x coordinate of the computed point

              </t>

              <t>A temporary key K is derived from the shared secret ZZ as follows:

                <vspace blankLines='1'/>

                K = KDF(LeadingInfo | ZZ | TrailingInfo)

                <vspace blankLines='1'/>

                LeadingInfo ::= Subject Distinguished Name from certificate

                <vspace blankLines='0'/>

                TrailingInfo ::= Issuer Distinguished Name from certificate</t>

              <t> Compute MAC(K, text).</t>
            </list>
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The POP verification process requires the Recipient to carry out steps (a) through (d) and then simply compare the result of step (d) with what it received as the signature component. If they match then the following can be concluded:

        <list style="format %c)">

          <t> The Entity possesses the private key corresponding to the
            public key in the certification request because it needed the
            private key to calculate the shared secret; and</t>

          <t> Only the Recipient that the entity sent the request to could
            actually verify the request because it would require its
            own private key to compute the same shared secret. In the case
            where the recipient is a Certification Authority, this
            protects the Entity from rogue CAs.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>In the static DH POP and static ECDH POP algorithms, an appropriate value can be produced
        by either party.  Thus these algorithms only provides integrity and not
        origination service.  The Discrete Logarithm algorithm provides both
        integrity checking and origination checking.</t>

      <t>All the security in this system is provided by the secrecy of the
        private keying material. If either sender or recipient private keys
        are disclosed, all messages sent or received using that key are
        compromised. Similarly, loss of the private key results in an
        inability to read messages sent using that key.</t>

      <t>Selection of parameters can be of paramount importance.  In the
        selection of parameters one must take into account the
        community/group of entities that one wishes to be able to communicate
        with.  In choosing a set of parameters one must also be sure to avoid
        small groups.  [FIPS-186] Appendixes 2 and 3 contain information on
        the selection of parameters for DH.  <xref target="RFC6090"/> Section 10 contains information on the selection of parameter for ECC. The practices outlined in these document
        will lead to better selection of parameters.</t>

The cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the properties of the underlying hash function.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>This document standardizes one particular Diffie-Hellman variant,  based on the ANSI X9.42 draft, developed by the ANSI X9F1 working group. Diffie-Hellman is a key agreement algorithm used by two parties to agree on a shared secret. An algorithm for converting the shared secret into an arbitrary amount of keying material is provided. The resulting keying material is used as a symmetric encryption key.  The Diffie-Hellman variant described requires the recipient to have a certificate, but the originator may have a static key pair (with the public key placed in a certificate) or an ephemeral key pair.</t></abstract></front>

<t>   Step 2.  Form the value to be signed and hash with SHA1.  The result
  of the hash for this example is:</t>
   <figure><artwork>
     5f a2 69 b6 4b 22 91 22 6f 4c fe 68 ec 2b d1 c6
     d4 21 e5 2c
</artwork></figure>

<t>   Step 3.  The hash value needs to be expanded since |q| = 256.  This
   is done by hashing the hash with SHA1 and appending it to the
  original hash.  The value after this step is:</t>

   <figure><artwork>
     5f a2 69 b6 4b 22 91 22 6f 4c fe 68 ec 2b d1 c6

     6f 26 3b f7 1c a3 b2 cb
</artwork></figure>

<t>   Next the first 255 bits of this value are taken to be the resulting
   "hash" value.  Note in this case a shift of one bit right is done
  since the result is to be treated as an integer:</t>

<t>   Step 4.  The signature value is computed.  In this case you get the
  values</t>

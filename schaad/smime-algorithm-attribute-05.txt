  Cryptographic Messages Syntax (CMS) Algorithm Identifier Protection

Abstract

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) unlike X.509/PKIX
   certificates, are venerable to algorithm substitution attacks.  In an
   algorithm substitution attack, the attacker changes either the
   algorithm being used or parameters of the algorithm in order to
   change the result of a signature verification process.  In X.509
   certificates, the signature algorithm is protected because it is
   duplicated in the TBSCertificate.signature field with the proviso
   that the validater is to compare both fields as part of the signature
   validation process.  This document defines a new attribute that
   contains a copy of the relevant algorithm identifiers so that they
   are protected by the signature or authentication process.

1.  Introduction

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS] unlike X.509/PKIX
   certificates [RFC5280], are venerable to algorithm substitution
   attacks.  In an algorithm substitution attack, the attacker changes
   either the algorithm being used or parameters of the algorithm in
   order to change the result of a signature verification process.  In
   X.509 certificates, the signature algorithm is protected because it
   is duplicated in the TBSCertificate.signature field with the proviso
   that the validater is to compare both fields as part of the signature
   validation process.  This document defines a new attribute that
   contains a copy of the relevant algorithm identifiers so that they
   are protected by the signature or authentication process.

   In an algorithm substitution attack, the attacker looks for a
   different algorithm that produces the same result as the algorithm
   used by the signer.  As an example, if the creator of the message
   used SHA-1 as the digest algorithm to hash the message content then
   the attacker looks for a different hash algorithm that produces a
   result that is the same length, but with which it is easier to find
   collisions.  Examples of other algorithms that produce a hash value
   of the same length would be SHA-0 or RIPEMD-160.  Similar attacks can
   be mounted against parameterized algorithm identifiers.  When looking
   at some of the proposed randomized hashing functions, such as that in
   [RANDOM-HASH], the associated security proofs assume that the
   parameters are solely under the control of the originator and not
   subject to selection by the attacker.

   Some algorithms have been internally designed to be more resistant to
   this type of attack.  Thus an RSA PKCS #1 v.15 signature [RFC3447]
   cannot have the associated hash algorithm changed because it is
   encoded as part of the signature.  DSA was originally defined so that
   it would only work with SHA-1 as a hash algorithm, thus by knowing
   the public key from the certificate, a validator can be assured that
   the hash algorithm can not be changed.  There is a convention,
   undocumented as far as I can tell, that the same hash algorithm
   should be used for both the content digest and the signature digest.
   There are cases, such as third party signers that are only given a
   content digest, where such a convention cannot be enforced.

   As with all attacks, the attack is going to be desirable on items
   that are both long term and high value.  One would expect that these
   attacks are more likely to be made on older documents as the
   algorithms being used when the message was signed would be more
   likely to have degraded over time.  Countersigning, the classic
   method of protecting a signature does not provide any additional
   protection against an algorithm substitution attack because
   countersignatures sign just the signature, but the algorithm

   substitution attacks leave the signature value alone while changing
   the algorithms being used.

   Using the SignerInfo structure from CMS, let's take a more detailed
   look at each of the fields in the structure and discuss what fields
   are and are not protected by the signature.  I have included a copy
   of the ASN.1 here for convenience.  A similar analysis of the
   AuthenticatedData structure is left to the reader, but it can be done
   in much the same way.

         SignerInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
           version CMSVersion,
           sid SignerIdentifier,
           digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
           signedAttrs [0] IMPLICIT SignedAttributes OPTIONAL,
           signatureAlgorithm SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier,
           signature SignatureValue,
           unsignedAttrs [1] IMPLICIT UnsignedAttributes OPTIONAL }


   version  is not protected by the signature.  As many implementations
      of CMS today ignore the value of this field that is not a problem.
      If the value is increased, then no changes in the processing are
      expected.  If the value is decreased, implementations that respect
      the structure would fail to decode, but an erroneous signature
      validation would not be completed successfully.

   sid  can be protected using either version of the signing certificate
      authenticated attribute.  SigningCertificateV2 is defined in
      [RFC5035].  SigningCertificate is defined in [ESS-BASE].  In
      addition to allowing for the protection of the signer identifier,
      the specific certificate is protected by including a hash of the
      certificate to be used for validation.

   digestAlgorithm  the digest algorithm used has been implicitly
      protected by the fact that CMS has only defined one digest
      algorithm for each hash value length.  (The algorithm RIPEM-160
      was never standardized).  There is also an unwritten convention
      that the same digest algorithm should be used both here and for
      the signature algorithm.  If newer digest algorithms are defined
      so that there are multiple algorithms for a given hash length (it
      is expected that the SHA-3 project will do so), or that parameters
      are defined for a specific algorithm, much of the implicit
      protection will be lost.

Internet-Draft           CMS Algorithm Attribute            January 2011


   signedAttributes  are directly protected by the signature when they
      are present.  The DER encoding of this value is what is hashed for
      the signature computation.

   signatureAlgorithm  has been protected by implication in the past.
      The use of an RSA public key implied that the RSA v 1.5 signature
      algorithm was being used.  The hash algorithm and this fact could
      be checked by the internal padding defined.  This is no longer
      true with the addition of the RSA-PSS signature algorithms.  The
      use of a DSA public key implied the SHA-1 hash algorithm as that
      was the only possible hash algorithm and the DSA was the public
      signature algorithm.  This is still somewhat true as there is an
      implicit tie between the length of the DSA public key and the
      length of the hash algorithm to be used, but this is known by
      convention and there is no explicit enforcement for this.

   signature  is not directly protected by any other value unless a
      counter signature is present.  However this represents the
      cryptographically computed value that protects the rest of the
      signature information.

   unsignedAttrs  is not protected by the signature value.  It is also
      explicitly designed that they not to be protected by the signature
      value.

   As can be seen above, the digestAlgorithm and signatureAlgorithm
   fields have been indirectly rather than explicitly protected in the
   past.  With new algorithms that have been or are being defined this
   will no longer be the case.  This document defines and describes a
   new attribute that will explicitly protect these fields along with
   the macAlgorithm field of the AuthenticatedData structure.

2.  Attribute Structure

   The following defines the algorithm protection attribute:

   The algorithm-protection attribute has the ASN.1 type
   CMSAlgorithmProtection:

       aa-cmsAlgorithmProtection ATTRIBUTE ::= {
           TYPE CMSAlgorithmProtection
           IDENTIFIED BY { id-aa-CMSAlgorithmProtection }
       }

   The following object identifier identifies the algorithm-protection
   attribute:

       id-aa-CMSAlgorithmProtection OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
            member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 52 }

   The algorithm-protection attribute uses the following ASN.1 type:


      CMSAlgorithmProtection ::= SEQUENCE {
          digestAlgorithm         DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
          signatureAlgorithm  [1] SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL,
          macAlgorithm        [2] MessageAuthenticationCodeAlgorithm
                                           OPTIONAL
      }
      (WITH COMPONENTS { signatureAlgorithm PRESENT,
                         macAlgorithm ABSENT } |
       WITH COMPONENTS { signatureAlgorithm ABSENT,
                         macAlgorithm PRESENT })

   The fields are defined as follows:

   digestAlgorithm  contains a copy of the SignerInfo.digestAlgorithm
      field or the AuthenticatedData.digestAlgorithm field including any
      parameters associated with it.

   signatureAlgorithm  contains a copy of the signature algorithm
      identifier and any parameters associated with it
      (SignerInfo.signatureAlgorithm).  This field is only populated if
      the attribute is placed in a SignerInfo.signedAttrs sequence.

   macAlgorithm  contains a copy of the message authentication code
      algorithm identifier and any parameters associated with it
      (AuthenticatedData.macAlgorithm).  This field is only populated if
      the attribute is placed in an AuthenticatedData.authAttrs
      sequence.

Internet-Draft           CMS Algorithm Attribute            January 2011


   Exactly one of signatureAlgorithm and macAlgorithm SHALL be present.

   An algorithm-protection attribute MUST have a single attribute value,
   even though the syntax is defined as a SET OF AttributeValue.  There
   MUST NOT be zero or multiple instances of AttributeValue present.

   The algorithm-protection attribute MUST be a signed attribute or an
   authenticated attribute; it MUST NOT be an unsigned attribute, an
   unauthenticated attribute or an unprotected attribute.

   The SignedAttributes and AuthAttributes syntax are each defined as a
   SET of Attributes.  The SignedAttributes in a signerInfo MUST include
   only one instance of the algorithm protection attribute.  Similarly,
   the AuthAttributes in an AuthenticatedData MUST include only one
   instance of the algorithm protection attribute.

3.  Verification Process

   While the exact verification steps depends on the structure that is
   being validated, there are some common rules that are to be followed
   when comparing the two algorithm structures:

   o  A field with a default value MUST compare as being the same
      independent of whether the value is defaulted or is explicitly
      provided.

   o  It is implementation dependent if, for some algorithms, the
      absence of a parameter and the presence of a NULL parameter are
      compared as being equivalent.  This behavior SHOULD NOT be
      expected.  This is an issue because some implementations will omit
      a NULL element, while other will encode a NULL element for some
      digest algorithms such as SHA-1 (see the comments in section 2.1
      of [RFC3370]).  The issue is even worse because the NULL is absent
      in some cases ([RFC3370]), but is required in other cases (for
      example see [RFC4056]).

3.1.  Signed Data Verification Changes

   If a CMS validator supports this attribute, the following additional
   verification steps MUST be performed:

   1.  The SignerInfo.digestAlgorithm field MUST be compared to the
   digestAlgorithm field in the attribute.  If the fields are not the
   same (modulo encoding) then signature validation MUST fail.

   2.  The SignerInfo.signatureAlgorithm field MUST be compared to the
   signatureAlgorithm field in the attribute.  If the fields are not the
   same (modulo encoding) then the signature validation MUST fail.

3.2.  Authenticated Data Verification Changes

   If a CMS validator supports this attribute, the following additional
   verification steps MUST be performed:

   1.  The AuthenticatedData.digestAlgorithm field MUST be compared to
   the digestAlgorithm field in the attribute.  If the fields are not
   same (modulo encoding) then authentication MUST fail.

   2.  The AuthenticatedData.macAlgorithm field MUST be compared to the
   macAlgorithm field in the attribute.  If the fields are not the same
   (modulo encoding) then the authentication MUST fail.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.  All identifiers are assigned out
   of the S/MIME OID arc.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document is designed to address the security issue of algorithm
   substitutions of the algorithms used by the validator.  At this time
   there is no known method to exploit this type of attack.  If the
   attack could be successful, then either a weaker algorithm could be
   substituted for a stronger algorithm or the parameters could be
   modified by an attacker to change the behavior of the hashing
   algorithm used.  (One example would be changing the initial parameter
   value for [XOR-HASH].)

   The attribute defined in this document is to be placed in a location
   that is protected by the signature or message authentication code.
   This attribute does not provide any additional security if placed in
   an un-signed or un-authenticated location.

    <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The CLUE WG is chartered to design a protocol to enable communication about media streams for videoconferencing and telepresence working in conjunction with the IETF’s protocol suites of choice, namely SIP for basic call setup and control and RTP for media transport. 
      (It should be noted that ITU-T Q.xx/16 has informally expressed a desire that parts or all of the work of the CLUE WG can be re-used in an H.323 environment.  Therefore, occasionally, we comment on the re-use of CLUE work outside of SIP systems.  This does not mean that we want to extent the charter; however, it seems sensible at least to us that if a cross protocol solution and a SIP-only solution to the CLUE problem could be devised, and both solutions are comparable in in their complexity etc etc, a solution with applicability beyond SIP may be the appropriate choice.)
      </t>
     <t>This document describes options for the coding and transport of CLUE messages in a SIP / RTP environment.  Specifically, three issues are addressed.</t><t>First, while the framework draft conceptually describes message flows, it does not specify how those messages are actually transferred &quot;on the wire&quot; and how they relate to the SIP 
offer/answer <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>.  This document lists (hopefully all) the options that have been proposed  in CLUE to date.</t><t>Second, the framework-01 draft describes three messages between the producer and the consumer in an abstract form, without specifying the details of the representation of those messages.  This memo lists (some of) the options for the representation of the abstract messages of the framework draft.</t><t>Third, before any CLUE messages can be meaningfully exchanged, it is necessary to discover whether the involved systems are actually CLUE-capable. This memo discusses the proposed options for CLUE capability discovery.</t><t>In this memo we only present the options discussed to date in the working group.  
Deciding on the appropriate mechanism 
(or mechanisms, as it is not always appropriate to have a single solution for a given problem, 
though this is of course desirable from an interoperability viewpoint) is left for further discussion in the working group.  
That does not mean that the authors do not have preferences, and/or specific knowledge of certain mechanisms, and 
may as a result go in greater depth in describing one mechanism than another.</t>

      <section anchor="assumpt" title="Assumptions">
        <t>The Basic Clue data model is specified in the framework document.  The framework defines three messages that carry the Clue data:</t>

        
        <t>Consumer Capability Message</t>
        <t>Provider Capabilities Announcement</t>
        
        <t>Consumer Configure Request</t>

<t>(There is no clear consensus that the Consumer Capability Message is needed, 
but for the time being we attempt to document how it fits in the different options.)</t>

<t>CLUE messages may need to be sent at the initialization of a call, and possibly also at 
irregular intervals within a call, spaced in the order of seconds, minutes or even longer.
There is also no hard real-time transmission requirement for CLUE messages; 
latencies in the seconds range are acceptable. More specifically, there appears not to be an issue with system reaction delay larger than the maximum round trip delay for reasonable operation of a telepresence system.</t><t>The Clue message handshake as required by the framework (independent from the issue related to the need of the Consumer Capability Message)  
is different from the offer/answer (o/A) exchange <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>, primarily because the CLUE exchange is uni-directional, requiring  a similar exchange for each side of the media flow, 
while one offer/answer exchange  defines both sides of the media flow. 
(Note that asymmetry in SIP may require a second offer answer exchange,   
but this is not the typical case)</t><t>There is no hard requirement for synchronization of CLUE messages, 
though there may be a need for sequencing, (TBD).</t><t>CLUE messages may need to describe the characteristics of all endpoints in a conference (TBD), and that conference can potentially include dozens of endpoints.</t>
<t>It appears to be consensus within the CLUE WG that there will be an SDP offer/answer exchange 
as part of the solution.
   It further appears to be the consensus that the offer/answer will be used to establish the 
   media channels and
 negotiate those SDP parameters negotiable with media types (i.e. as defined in RTP payload formats), as well as to allow interoperability with
   systems that do not support the CLUE protocol.  It appears to be a sensible design goal that the CLUE data does not duplicate SDP attributes.
</t>
<t>
In order to achieve interoperability with systems that do not support CLUE, the first offer answer exchange could be used to negotiate CLUE support. 
</t>
<t>
An open issue is whether there needs to be a final offer answer exchange, 
after initial o/A exchange(s) as well as CLUE exchange(s), with an SDP reflecting the 
negotiated media flows, in order to address requirements imposed by intermediaries like 
Session Border Controllers (SBC). This topic was discussed in different contexts before, 
and there is some text about it in RFC5939 section 3.12 <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>
</t>
<t>
The size of a CLUE message is far from final yet but when selecting a solution the issue of message size and fragmentation (if applicable) needs to be addressed.
</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="trans" title="Transport for CLUE messages">
        <t>CLUE messages need to be conveyed from one CLUE capable system to another, i.e., there 
        needs to be &quot;transport&quot; of CLUE messages.  It should be clear that the message transport can be based on a transport layer (layer 4 in ISO/OSI) protocol or other layers, such as the application layer.</t>
        <t>In contrast to the &quot;content representation&quot;, the transport of CLUE messages is somewhat more tightly bound to the environment.  In some scenarios it may be possible to reuse most of the mechanisms defined in an option for transport between SIP and H.323, while in others this is not possible.</t>

<t>
   The selection of the transport may have some affect on the content
   representation, in that certain transports in the aforementioned sense are defined only to carry certain types of messages.  For example, offer-answer is defined for the use in conjunction with SDP as content representation.  In contrast, obviously, a CLUE-defined transport mechanism could carry any format specified by CLUE.
</t>
<t>
The CLUE protocol enables the CLUE systems to negotiate the semantic relationships of the media streams, mostly with respect to spatial relations.  Another aspect that has recently risen to prominence is the negotiation of media codec settings, taking into account that in practical telepresence systems, certain combinations of codec settings may not be supported by the hardware 
(&quot;codec alternatives&quot; henceforth).
</t>
<t>
The apparently generally agreed need for interoperability with non CLUE systems requires defining an initial offer involving CLUE support, and guidance on how to progress the call setup based on the answer.  The CLUE WG discussed a couple of options including two stage offer answer, using grouping 
similar to <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation"></xref>, and using the 
capability negotiation of <xref target="RFC5939"></xref>. 
</t>
<t>
We would like to consider the following options:
</t>
<section anchor="t1" title="Option 1 : Piggy-pack on SIP">

<t>SIP includes a number of methods that can carry (directly or through
   content indirection) CLUE messages.  Many of these messages can be
   exchanged during the lifetime of a session.  Piggy-packing CLUE
   messages on SIP has the advantage that any built-in transport and
   reliability mechanisms of SIP can be re-used.  (Whether this is an advantage in practice is somewhat questionable, considering that the vast majority of SIP systems use UDP for the transport of SIP messages, and that their SIP messages are typically small enough to fit into an MTU--something that like is not true for some CLUE messages.)  It also has the
   feature (advantage?) that CLUE signaling is being conveyed in the
   signaling plane rather than in the media plane (making things such as
   decomposition potentially easier and certainly more intuitive).
 </t>
  <t>
 There are three sub-options to consider
 </t>
            <section anchor="t1.1" title="Option 1.1: Using SDP (in an offer-answer context) for CLUE information">
            <t>
            In this option, the CLUE protocol is specified through the addition of CLUE-specific SDP codepoints in the (essentially unmodified) offer/answer process, for essentially all CLUE functionalities.  The stream semantics associated with spatial relations of streams are represented as new SDP attributes . Codec alternatives may be negotiated based on draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities. 
            </t>
            <t>
            The nature of spatial relations currently envisioned by some CLUE participants have some simultaneous restrictions due to the limitations of physical capture devices.  For this reason, it may become necessary to separate the negotiation process into a session negotiation that defines RTP sessions, and a session negotiated that deals with  the spatial relations. 
            </t>
            <t>
            It is noted that, at the time of writing, there is no proposal on the table that would suggest that offer-answer only is a sensible--or even possible--design choice.
            </t>

            </section>
        
            <section anchor="t1.2" title="Option 1.2: Using an SDP MIME body to carry the CLUE information in an INVITE or UPDATE exchange">
            <t>
            In order to separate the RTP session negotiation from the CLUE media capture selection, a clean solution appears to be to carry the CLUE information in a body separate from the classic media negotiation information, with a parallel negotiation using INVITE and UPDATE for the CLUE information. A similar approach is 
            proposed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-siprec-protocol"></xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
            There were concerns about using re-invite, 
   claiming that it takes too long since that commonly implies codec boxes
   teardown of every existing media session during re-invites.  
            <xref target="RFC3311"></xref>suggests that although UPDATE can be used on confirmed dialogs, it is RECOMMENDED that a re-INVITE be used instead.  This is because an
   UPDATE needs to be answered immediately, ruling out the possibility
   of user approval.  Such approval may be needed, and is
   possible only with a re-INVITE.
            </t>
            </section>
            
            <section anchor="t1.3" title="Option 1.3: Using a SIP INFO package">
            <t>
            Another option may be to define a new SIP INFO package <xref target="RFC6086"></xref>.
            The SIP-INFO method is very flexible in that the package can define, at least to a large extent, the semantics of a SIP-INFO exchange.  However, SIP-INFO is subject to SIP’s limitations, for example in terms of message size when SIP messages are transported over UDP (which, we understand, is the common operation point.
            </t>
            </section>
            
            <section anchor="t1.4" title="Option 1.4: SIP signaling options">
            <t>            
            There may be other
   options using SIP signaling, such as  subscribe/ notify or Message method, see <xref target="RFC6086"></xref>
   section 8.4.1.  Note that, in those cases, a subscribe creates a separate dialog usage
   and is normally sent outside of existing dialog.  Within this document, we are not discussing the implications of such a possible implementation path.            
            </t>
            </section>

        
        </section>
        
        <section anchor="t2" title="Option 2: CLUE control channel on the media plane over UDP">
        
<t>
During the initial SIP handshake, a secure(?) CLUE channel is established (if
   both systems are CLUE capable). This channel may be UDP or TCP based. 
Using UDP may require an additional reliability mechanism, perhaps 
using a mechanism similar to BFCP over UDP, and addressing 
fragmentation is likely to be necessary due to message size. 
These complications are not required for a TCP based solution. 
On the other hand, using ICE to address firewall and NAT traversal as 
well as working with intermediaries like SBCs works better with UDP. 
Note that even under this option, we assume that the actual protocol exchange to 
negotiate and open media channels is being conducted using an SDP content representation, quite possibly through 
a &quot;fincal&quot; offer-answer exchange that nails down the actual media flows to be used, 
for the benefit of SBCs and similar middleboxes.  
</t>

        </section>
        
        <section anchor="t3" title="Option 3: Other Work">

<t>
At least three other individual submissions address similar topics as this section, and the the reader’s attention is drawn to those.  
Specifically: </t>

            <t>            
            <xref target="I-D.hansen-clue-protocol-choices-evaluation"></xref> goes into some detail in analyzing 
            the pros and cons of a previous version of our document.  
            The authors arrive at a conclusion that can be summarized as that there is a need for a transport mechanism that is not based on SIP, 
            but using a UDP session negotiated using SIP and Offer/Answer for the transport of CLUE messages.  
            CLUE messages in this case probably ought to be interpreted narrowly in that they relate to 
            spatial relationships and related issues, in contrast to codec parameter negotiation.
            </t>
            
            <t>            
            <xref target="I-D.romanow-clue-sdp-usage"></xref> arrives at a similar conclusion.
            The draft lists those codepoints that could be conveyed using SDP in an offer-answer setting: video properties (bandwidth and resolution), and bandwidth-related group 
            settings.  Everything else, including spatial relationship of captures, is suggested to be conveyed over a CLUE-specific protocol, conveyed over a UDP(?) session negotiated in SIP during the early (first) offer/answer exchange.
            </t>
            
            <t>            
            <xref target="I-D.cazeaux-clue-sip-signaling"></xref> signaling appears to advocate a solution in which SDP based O/A is used to negotiate media.  The negotiated media appear to be a superset of the media later being used.  CLUE specific information, such as spatial relationships, but also the details of the media sessions (including restrictions of provider content 
            selection based on consumer capabilities), appear to be relegated to signaling conveyed over a SIP/OA negotiated CLUE channel.  
            </t>
            <t>
            All three aforementioned drafts appear to acknowledge the need for a CLUE signaling channel, possibly conveyed directly over UDP (in contrast to a being conveyed over 
            SIP-info or something similar), although these drafts vary in the degree to 
            which they use the CLUE signaling channel.
            </t>
       </section>
        
 
                
      </section>

      <section anchor="cr" title="Content Representation">
      
<t>The data model in the framework-03 draft does not include a specification of the
   representation of the data.  
  Many different representation languages, for example XML, 
possibly SDP, ASN.1, and others can be used, and we need to decide on 
one, possibly for each data structure defined in a CLUE solution (that is, for example, it&apos;s possible that some data points of CLUE can be conveyed in SDP, whereas others use XML).  
Depending on the transport decision, we may be restricted to certain representations for certain data structures, or we may have freedom of choice. Referring to the options suggested above, it is clear that option 3.1.1  mandates SDP for representing CLUE.  However, all other options appear not to require any pre-defined choice, at least for some (though not necessarily for all) of 
the CLUE-defined codepoints. 
</t> 

<t>One observation that has to be made at this point (described in greater detail above) is that the framework-01 draft&apos;s message exchange 
system requires more than one end to end exchange due to the asymmetry.  Another observation is that the advertisement describes the sending options, which  makes the
   CLUE exchange different from the offer/answer mechanism SIP videoconferencing
   endpoints use today. For this reason we do not think that the option in 3.1.1 is a good direction.  Therefore, there appears not to be a hard requirement to use
   SDP exclusively for the representation of CLUE messages.  For some messages, SDP may be an appropriate choice, but for others, there is no precedence: We have a freedom
   of choice here, which is why this section exists.
</t> 

<t> 
   It is very well possible that even moderately complex CLUE messages
   may exceed MTU sizes commonly found in today’s Internet.  There has
   been discussion in CLUE of sessions with thousands of participants—a very 
   real requirement for at least one of the authors of this draft, who routinely 
   participates in multipoint videoconferences with 200+ participants.
   Even if a CLUE message can be compressed into a few bytes for each
   endpoint, such sessions will violate the commonly found
   Ethernet 1492-byte MTU. Accordingly, message transport protocols will
   have to be prepared to split CLUE messages into fragments, which has
   implications on the design complexity of those protocols.  This
   problem is especially an issue for verbose representations, such as
   XML.
</t> 

            <section anchor="cr1" title="Option 1 : SDP">
<t> 
SDP and its various extensions are used in SIP based systems for the
   offer/answer exchange, and, therefore, those systems include SDP
   parsers that could probably be extended to support CLUE messages.
   SDP is also a fairly compact, but still (though barely) human
   readable .   Even though it does not appear to us to make overly much sense to use SDP for CLUE, since it will require a separate blob for describing the CLUE relations between the media captures, it still viable to use text based representation for CLUE if using any of the options which is not 3.1.1.
<xref target="I-D.romanow-clue-sdp-usage"></xref> suggests that an SDP-only 
representation of CLUE based parameters is an (impossible/suboptimal) bad choice.  
We concur.  As mentioned before, though, those parameters that can reasonably be negotiated using 
SDP o/A (with however many round trip it takes) should in our opinion be represented in SDP.  
We shouldn&apos;t be in SDP-ng&apos;s business.
  </t> 
        </section>


            <section anchor="cr2" title="Option 2 : XML">
<t> 
XML is very flexible, and the representation of choice for many IETF
   technologies not bound to a certain legacy.  It certainly allows for
   all flexibility needed to represent all CLUE messages currently
   considered.  It also is naturally extensible in a way SDP is not.  On
   the downside, XML is fairly verbose, which has implications on the
   transport.  Even considering this verboseness, we believe that XML may be an appropriate 
   representation for CLUE messages that cannot be represented in SDP.
</t> 
        </section>

            <section anchor="cr3" title="Option 3 : ASN.1">
<t>ASN.1 is similarly flexible and extensible as XML, and (in its binary representation) fairly compact.  While it is commonly used in H.323, and while the video conferencing industry certainly has access to the tools necessary to deploy ASN.1 (a major obstacle in other industries), it is not widely used by SIP implementations.</t>

        <section anchor="cr4" title="Option 4 : Clue Defined Format">
<t>It is, of course, possible that the CLUE WG defines its own format, possibly compact, possibly binary and possibly extensible representation language or format for CLUE messages.  </t>

    <t>
    The preferred solution can be XML-based for codepoints not easily (currently?) 
    representable in SDP, and SDP based for everything else. ]   
    With respect to XML’s verboseness, fragmentation support in the transport protocol 
    may be needed and the transport probably should include a fragmentation and reassembly 
    support beyond IP fragmentation/re-assembly.  Such support may require an encapsulation 
    of the message with headers that will allow fragmentation and reassembly support.

    <section anchor="cd" title="Clue Discovery">
    
<t>
    This section summarizes ways to discover whether systems involved are
   CLUE-capable.  For simplicity, point-to-point scenarios are assumed.
   Multipoint scenarios are similar since we are considering centralized conference models only.
</t>
<t>
   Discovery appears to be necessarily bound to the capability exchange
   of the involved systems.
</t>

        <section anchor="cd1" title="Option 1 : CLUE discovery as a side effect of opening a CLUE control channel">
        <t>
        If, for the transport of CLUE messages (or at least a subset thereof), a media plane control channel
   were used (section 3.2), then the discovery
   of CLUE capability would be a side effect of the opening of this
   control channel during the initial offer/answer exchange.  At this point in time, there is no proposal on the table that suggest that we can avoid a CLUE control channel.

        </section>  

        <section anchor="cd2" title="Option 2 : SIP Message Transport">
        <t>
        Very roughly speaking, if we use the INFO message for the transport of all CLUE messages, then by using the Recv-Info header field
   the support for the CLUE package can be signaled. If using a second MIME body the support of the MIME body in the offer answer can be used.

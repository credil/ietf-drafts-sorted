Abstract

   RFC3312 & 4032 has defined semantics of suspending and resuming for
   session establishment.  But suspending and resuming for session
   modification needs clarification, especially for modification with
   part of the streams with precondition.  This text just aims for
   giving out some use case for further analysis.  And if we need do
   some standard track for this issue, IMO, the "Re-INVITE Handling"
   draft can be more proper and systematic.

1.  Introduction

   RFC3312 & 4032 did not talk about session modification with
   precondition for detail.  And, there are two alternatives for this
   issue here:

   o suspending and resuming for whole session;

   o suspending and resuming for streams with precondition separately;

   Considering a use case, A and B has a audio only session.  Then A
   send a Re-INVITE for adding vedio stream( with precondition) and
   changing codec or address for audio stream( without preconditon).  If
   suspending is effective for whole session, then streams without
   precondition should use old parameters while in suspending state.  If
   suspending is effective for streams with precondition, the then
   streams without preconditio can use new parameters after first O/A
   during the Re-INVITE.

   I will use some use cases to reveal the drawbacks of "suspending and
   resuming for whole session".

2.  Drawbacks of suspending and resuming for whole session

2.1.  To delay using of new parameters for stream without precondition
      may arose media clip problem

   Considering a use case, A and B has a audio only session.  Then A
   send a Re-INVITE(F1) for adding vedio stream(with precondition) and
   changing codec or address for audio stream(without preconditon).  If
   suspending is effective for whole session, then streams without
   precondition should use old parameters while in suspending state.
   But sometimes, A has no way to use old parameters anymore, for
   example session mobility.  Then, it aroses media clip problem.

2.2.  Behavior of streams without precondition would be depend on the
      existence of other streams

   Considering a use case, A and B has a audio only session.  Then A
   send a Re-INVITE(F1) for adding vedio stream and changing codec or
   address for audio stream(without precondition).  If suspending is
   effective for whole session, then the behavior of audio stream would
   be depend on the condition of vedio stream.  The user will be

   confused.  As:

   If vedio stream is without preconditon too, B will send F2 with
   answer at once.  And B can use new parameters of audio stream just
   after F2.

2.3.  Various streams are not controlled by the same entity, so that
      coordination of when they take effect could be problematic

   Considering a use case, A and B has a audio only session.  Then A
   send a Re-INVITE(F1) for adding vedio stream and changing codec or
   address for audio stream(without precondition).  And B is controller
   of Media Servers.  So, it will dispatch the offer(or part streams of
   the offer) to media servers.  As in Figure, the controller will send
   audio stream to media server1 using Re-INVITE, and send vedio stream
   to media server2 using INVITE.

   If suspending is effective for whole session, then the new parameters
   of audio stream should not be used.  And it is complex or difficult
   for controller to do so.

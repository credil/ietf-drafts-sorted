               Using the Flow Label with Dual-Stack Lite
               draft-donley-softwire-dslite-flowlabel-02

Abstract

   This document extends the use of Dual-Stack Lite to identify discrete
   traffic flows using the IPv6 Flow Label.  The identification of
   discrete traffic flows allows for the application of Quality of
   Service (QoS) classification and prioritization of traffic traversing
   Dual-Stack Lite tunnels.

1.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] describes a
   method for transitioning to IPv6 by encapsulating IPv4 traffic inside
   an IPv6 tunnel and translating it at the Address Family Translation
   Router.  By encapsulating such traffic, DS-Lite obfuscates the IPv4
   5-tuple behind the IPv6 header, thereby making it difficult to
   classify IPv4 traffic.  To QoS classifiers, all IPv4 traffic is
   encapsulated as an IP-in-IP tunnel using the same IPv6 source
   address, destination address, and protocol.  There is no
   differentiation for IPv4 traffic requiring differentiated quality of
   service such as Voice over IP.

   This lack of differentiation can be problematic for traffic types
   where prioritization is desired, and service providers need a way to
   classify such traffic.  For example, it is common practice to provide
   QoS for voice traffic.  In a cable environment, such classification/
   prioritization is performed using PacketCable Multimedia (PCMM).
   PCMM identifies traffic at an application manager (AM)/policy
   server(PS) and notifies the Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) to
   provide QoS using DOCSIS classifiers.  However, in a Dual-Stack Lite
   environment, the AM/PS is unable to identify characteristics of a
   particular IPv4 traffic flow and apply QoS using DOCSIS classifiers.
   This problem is applicable to other QoS systems, as well, including
   access-list-based classifiers.

   This document proposes a method of identifying individual traffic
   flows encapsulated using DS-Lite using the IPv6 Flow Label.

3.  Allowing Dual-Stack Lite QoS Using the IPv6 Flow Label

   As described in [RFC3697], a flow is a sequence of packets sent from
   a particular source to a particular unicast, anycast, or multicast
   destination that the source desires to label as a flow.  IPv6 uses
   the Flow Label in the IPv6 header to identify such flows.  In cases
   where the Flow Label field uniquely identifies such traffic flows,
   packet classifiers can use the triplet of Flow Label, Source Address,
   and Destination Address fields to identify packets belonging to a
   particular flow.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], traffic is
   encapsulated between the Basic BroadBand Bridging (B4) element and
   Address Family Transition Router (AFTR).  Both the B4 and AFTR are
   aware of the 5-tuple of the encapsulated IPv4 traffic.  Thus, both
   the B4 and AFTR are capable of identifying IPv4 traffic flows and
   setting the IPv6 Flow Label for the DS-Lite tunnel accordingly.  By
   populating the Flow Label field in DS-Lite tunnels, service providers
   can use Flow Label classifiers to provide priority treatment to
   appropriate traffic flows.

   The B4 SHOULD uniquely set the IPv6 Flow Label to a non-zero value
   per IPv4 traffic flow in accordance with [RFC3697] and
   [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-update].  That is, the B4 SHOULD identify IPv4
   traffic flows by the IPv4 5-tuple of IPv4 Source Address, Destination
   Address, Protocol, Source Port, and Destination Port.  The B4 SHOULD
   construct a unique flow label based on the IPv4 5-tuple and apply it
   to the IPv6 header attached to that flow as it is encapsulated inside
   a DS-Lite tunnel.  If the B4 sets the IPv6 Flow-Label to a non-zero
   value, it MUST use the same Flow Label value for other IPv4 packets
   belonging to the same flow (as determined by the IPv4 5-tuple).

   The AFTR SHOULD uniquely set the IPv6 Flow Label per IPv4 traffic
   flow in accordance with [RFC3697] and [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-update].
   That is, the AFTR SHOULD identify IPv4 traffic flows to be sent to
   the B4 by the IPv4 5-tuple of IPv4 Source Address, Destination
   Address, Protocol, Source Port, and Destination Port after completing
   Network Address Translation.  The AFTR SHOULD construct a unique flow
   label based on the IPv4 5-tuple and apply it to the IPv6 header
   attached to that flow as it is encapsulated inside a DS-Lite tunnel.
   If the AFTR sets the IPv6 Flow-Label to a non-zero value, it MUST use
   the same Flow Label value for other IPv4 packets belonging to the
   same flow (as determined by the IPv4 5-tuple).

   The exact mechanism for constructing the Flow Label is not specified,
   except as per [RFC3697] and [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-update].
   Implementations could use a 20-bit hash of the IPv4 5-tuple such that
   subsequent IPv4 packets with the same 5-tuple will receive the same

   flow label.

   As directed by [RFC3697] and [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-update], Flow Label
   information is only significant to the B4 or AFTR transmitting the
   particular DS-Lite flow.  Since the Flow Label will be consistently
   applied to all packets in the flow, however, intermediate devices
   between the B4 and AFTR can use the Flow Label in packet classifiers
   to provide quality of service treatment to the flow.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are described in [RFC3697], section 5.  The
   flow label is not protected, and could be modified by an on-path
   attacker.  However, the impact of any such modification would be
   limited to the QoS treatment of the modified packet(s).

Internet-Draft         Integrity Cookie Management          October 2010


Abstract

   This document defines an abstract syntax and semantic of HTTP 
   cookies. This approach presents a new cookie attribute that ensures
   cookie integrity and improves source authentication of the cookie
   sent back to the server.

   Cookies are always used on the Web in order to store user 
   identification data and sensible user information. Adversary can
   easily modify cookiesstored in the User Agent. Therefore, Origin
   Server has to be able to verify cookie integrity and ensure that
   the returned cookies are its own cookies.

   This document explains a way to calculate and apply the integrity
   attribute in HTTP cookie headers.

Internet-Draft          Integrity Cookie Management         October 2010


1.  Introduction

   HTTP [RFC2616] is an applicative layer protocol, widely used in World
   Wide Web. Tracking user session is not possible because this protocol
   is a stateless protocol. Consequently, cookies are the common
   solution that provides a stateful session with HTTP protocol.

   Cookie specifications [RFC2965, RFC2109] implement two complementary
   HTTP headers, Set-cookie header and Cookie header. Set-cookie header
   is sent through a response from Origin Server, while Cookie header is
   sent within a request from the User Agent to the Origin Server.

   This document describes the syntax of a new cookie attribute that
   ensures the integrity of the cookie received from the User Agent. The
   main challenges of adding this new cookie attribute is enabling the
   Origin Server to verify that it is the owner of the received cookies.
   This new attribute will be called ICD (Integrity Cookie Digit).

   The present proposal follows the same cookies syntax represented in
   RFC 2965[RFC2965] specification. The implementation and validation
   of this new proposal is addressed in the last section of this 
   document.

2.  Terminology

   The terms User Agent, server, and Origin Server have the same meaning
   as in the HTTP/1.0 specification [RFC1945]. HTTP cookies are
   initially developed by Netscape in 1994. Netscape's cookies
   technology led the Internet Engineering Task Force to develop a
   precise technical standard for cookies (Kristol and Montulli,
   2000) [RFC2965]. This work is based on the "HTTP State 
   Management Mechanism" [RFC2965]. The concept of cookie used
   throughout this work has the same meaning defined in this
   standard [RFC2965].

3.  Requirements
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Cookie management design

   This section describes cookie headers implementation in order to
   maintain the context state of User Agent. User Agent uses HTTP
   request to access resources created on the Origin Server. The
   latter set up the user context information and initiates a new
   HTTP session by including a Set-cookie header in HTTP response.

   Cookie header is included in the next HTTP request from the User 
   Agent to the same Origin Server. The server retrieves the client
   context information and sends the response to the User Agent.
   The Origin Server may modify the cookie content by returning a new
   Set-cookie header in HTTP response or it may send an HTTP response
   without Set-cookie Header.


           Client                                     Server
           ------                                     ------

      HTTP request           -------->


                             <--------            HTTP Response
                                                  Set-cookie header

                                                  Cookie stored in
                                                  user browser

      HTTP Request
      Cookie Header         -------->             Retrieve user
                                                  context information

      HTTP Response         <------->             HTTP Response


5. Syntax and Semantic of the cookie header

   This section presents a grammatical definition of the cookie header
   in EBNF form HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC2616]. The proposal ICD
   attribute will be used with the same grammatical definition of
   the cookie header field presented in this standard.
   The following grammar is described in RFC 2965 and it represents the
   general syntax of Set-cookie and cookie headers.

        av-pairs    =     av-pair *(";" av-pair)
        av-pair     =     attr ["=" value]
        attr        =     token
        value       =     token | quoted-string

5.1. Set-cookie Header

   This section defines the new syntax and semantic of Set-cookie
   attributes.

 5.1.1. Syntax

   This section describes the field Set-cookie as it is defined in
   RFC 2965 [RFC2965]. Then, it shows the required field that
   should be added to maintain cookie integrity.
   
   
          set-cookie      =       "Set-Cookie:" cookies
          cookies         =       1#cookie
          cookie          =       NAME "=" VALUE *(";" set-cookie-av)
          NAME            =       attr
          VALUE           =       value
          set-cookie-av   =       "Comment" "=" value
                          |       "CommentURL" "=" <"> http_URL <">
                          |       "Discard"
                          |       "Domain" "=" value
                          |       "Max-Age" "=" value
                          |       "Path" "=" value
                          |       "Port" [ "=" <"> portlist <"> ]
                          |       "Secure"
                          |       "Version" "=" 1*DIGIT
                          |       "ICD" "=" value
          portlist        =       1#portnum
          portnum         =       1*DIGIT

5.1.2. Semantics

   Set-cookie response header defines a token 'cookie' that will be
   stored in the User Agent.
   The User Agent returns the cookie header in HTTP request to the same
   Origin Server if the domain or the path attributes are conformed to
   the URL path name. Otherwise it ignores the cookie header.
   The Set-cookie attributes are defined and well detailed in RFC 2965.
   The ICD value is optional. It will include in Set-cookie header to
   ensure cookie integrity. The next section describes a method to
   calculate the value of this new attribute.

5.2. Cookie Header

5.2.1. Syntax

   This section describes the field Cookie as defined in RFC 2965.
   Then, it shows the ICD attribute that ensures cookie integrity.

       cookie         =  "Cookie:" cookie-version 1*((";" | ",") cookie
                         -value)
       cookie-value   =  NAME "=" VALUE [";" path] [";" domain] [";"
                         port]
       cookie-version =  "$Version" "=" value
       NAME           =  attr
       VALUE          =  value
       path           =  "$Path" "=" value
       domain         =  "$Domain" "=" value
       port           =  "$Port" ["=" <"> value <">]
       ICD            =  "$ICD" "=" value

5.2.2. Semantics

   Cookie header attributes are described in the RFC 2965. This
   specification shows that the User Agent sends a cookie to the Origin
   Server whose domain matches the URL path.
   The Origin Server gets the ICD value and verifies the cookie
   integrity. It compares the ICD received in cookie header with the
   one calculated based on the received data. This method allows the
   Origin Server to detect if data is modified. By applying this
   attribute in cookie header, Origin Server can control the source
   authenticity of the received cookie.

6. Proposal Integrity Cookie Management

   This section details the new attribute (Integrity Cookie Digit) that
   ensures the integrity of cookie information. It provides an absolute
   level of security for the Origin Server. This value has six digits
   long so it helps to decrease the overhead of cookie header.

Internet-Draft         Integrity Cookie Management          October 2010


6.1. Calculating ICD attribute

   The proposed attribute is based on a cryptographic hash function.
   Three steps are required to calculate it. First, a MAC (Message
   Authentication Code) value is generated by using HMAC [HMAC]
   function. This function uses a hash function and an Origin Server
   secret key. This key must be secret and known only by the Origin
   Server. Second, a 'truncation' function, inspired from HOTP
   standard [RFC4226], will be applied to the output of the HMAC
   function. Indeed, this function takes the last byte of MAC
   value. Then, it determines the decimal value of the lower four
   bits of this byte. It extracts four bytes starting at the byte
   whose number is the calculated decimal value.
   Finally, a 'modulo' function takes the output of truncation
   function, and generates the ICD value on six digits long.

6.2. Example of ICD computation

   This section presents an example of integrity value calculation. 
   Assume that the HMAC-SHA1 [SHA] function will be used throughout 
   this example and 'Ks' is the secret key of the Origin Server.
   Hash function will be applied to all data in cookie attributes.
   In the case of SHA1, the MAC size is 20 bytes. Then, note X the
   decimal value of the four least-significant-bit of the 19th byte.
   Thus, the truncated output takes four bytes long. Note Y the
   decimal value of the four bytes MAC starting at the Xth byte.
   The ICD is the result of applying modulo function (10^6) on Y.
   This attribute has six digits long.

   The following example illustrates a practical ICD calculation
   based on HMAC-SHA1:
   The initial Set-cookie header generated by the Origin Server is:
   
   server_sessionID=4jZmb5HFoXHe2xU6jKlqPkDD4GEdmUuZnlkROI9wXvIRQFFO
   h4QalBcvsWWwVTw; path=/;
  
   Assume that the 'value' attribute contains user password. Thus,
   the result of ICD calculation for this attribute is 879429.
   The new Set-cookie header includes the ICD attribute:
   
   server_sessionID=4jZmb5HFoXHe2xU6jKlqPkDD4GEdmUuZnlkROI9wXvIRQFFO
   h4QalBcvsWWwVTw; path=/; ICD=879429;

   6.3. Validation and implementation

   After the integrity control description of HTTP cookies, the
   implementation and verification were conducted.
   This contribution was practically tested on an 'AdminProxy' project
   certified by the competitiveness cluster System@tic Paris-Region.
   This project manages HTTP sessions under SSO architecture. It
   integrates an HTTP Reverse Proxy to protect internal servers
   under a common entry point. The Reverse Proxy acts as a session
   handler and uses cookies to maintain a session design. 
   Checking cookie integrity has been validated by implementing the
   method described in this paper. This was done by developing a new
   Apache module that manages secure HTTP sessions. This module includes
   a running code that computes integrity value on a six digits length.
   The simulations were carried using this API in Apache core. Apache
   server was configured as a Reverse Proxy HTTP. It protects many Web
   servers located at the network perimeter. Many tests were carried
   out by modifying cookie attributes.
   The results illustrate clearly the validation of this method for
   calculating integrity cookie attributes.

6.4. Security consideration and limitation

   Cookie attributes may store private and sensitive user information
   such as credit card number, password, user identifier, etc.
   If the Origin Server activates the "secure" flag, forwarding data
   requires a secure channel. Thus cookie attributes are protected
   when they are transmitted.
   However, an intruder can consult User Agent computer and therefore
   he can intercept, read and alter data information stored in the
   cookie. The ICD attribute should be included in each cookie response
   header to ensure integrity cookie data. The ICD implementation
   protects the cookie integrity as well as its authenticity.
   The Origin Server detects the modification of cookie attributes
   by calculating the ICD value. Thus, Origin Server can verify if
   the received cookie was its owner cookie. However the server is
   not yet able to know if the present cookie received from the User
   Agent was the last one it sent. Thus, another issue to be considered
   is the replay attack problem of cookie management.

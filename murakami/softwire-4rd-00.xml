    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism for
      providing IPv4 connectivity service to end users over a service
      provider's IPv6 network. Key aspects include stateless
      operation, sharing of IPv4 addresses, and an algorithmic mapping
      between IPv4 addresses and IPv6 tunnel endpoints.</t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>4rd is a protocol mechanism to deploy IPv4 to sites via a
      service provider's (SP's) IPv6 network.  Similar to Dual-Stack
      Lite <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite"></xref>,
      4rd is designed to allow IPv4 traffic to be delivered over an
      IPv6 network without the direct provisioning of IPv4
      addresses. 4rd can provide an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address or a
      shared IPv4 address. Like 6rd <xref target="RFC5969"></xref>,
      4rd is operated in a fully stateless manner within the SP
      network. The motivation for a stateless alternative to
      Dual-Stack Lite is described in "Motivations for Stateless IPv4
      over IPv6 Migration Solutions" <xref
      target="I-D.operators-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation"></xref>.
      </t>

      <t>4rd relies on IPv6 and is designed to deliver
      production-quality dual-stack service while allowing IPv4 to be
      phased out within the SP network. The phasing out of IPv4 within
      the SP network is independent of whether the end user disables
      IPv4 service or not.  Further, "Greenfield" IPv6-only networks
      may use 4rd in order to deliver IPv4 to sites via the IPv6
      network in a way that does not require protocol translation
      between IPv4 and IPv6.</t>

      <t>4rd utilizes an algorithmic mapping between the IPv6 and IPv4
      addresses that are assigned for use within the SP network. This
      mapping provides automatic determination of IPv6 tunnel
      endpoints from IPv4 destination addresses, allowing the
      stateless operation of 4rd. 4rd views the IPv6 network as a link
      layer for IPv4 and supports an automatic tunneling abstraction
      similar to the Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) <xref
      target="RFC2491"></xref> model.</t>

      <t>The 4rd algorithmic mapping is also used to automatically
      provision IPv4 addresses and allocating a set of non-overlapping
      ports for each 4rd CE.  The "SP-facing" (i.e., "WAN") side of
      the 4rd CE, operate as native IPv6 interface with no need for
      IPv4 operation or support. On the "end-user-facing" (i.e.,
      "LAN") side of a CE, IPv6 and IPv4 are implemented as for any
      native dual-stack service delivered by the SP.</t>

      <t>A 4rd domain consists of 4rd Customer Edge (CE) routers and
      one or more 4rd Border Relays (BRs). IPv4 packets encapsulated
      by 4rd follow the IPv6 routing topology within the SP network
      between CEs and among CEs and BRs. CE to CE traffic is direct,
      while BRs are traversed only for IPv4 packets that are destined
      to or are arriving from outside a given 4rd domain. As 4rd is
      stateless, BRs may be reached using anycast for failover and
      resiliency.</t>

      <t>4rd does not require any stateful NAPT <xref
      target="RFC3022"></xref> functions at the BRs or elsewhere
      within the SP network. Instead, 4rd allows for sharing of IPv4
      addresses among multiple sites by automatically allocating a set
      of non-overlapping ports for each CE as part of the stateless
      mapping function. It is expected that the CE will, in turn,
      perform local IPv4 Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT)
      <xref target="RFC3022"></xref> functions for the site as is
      commonly performed today, except avoiding ports outside of the
      allocated port set. Although 4rd is designed primarily to
      support IPv4 deployment to a customer site (such as a
      residential home network) by an SP, it can equally be applied to
      an individual host acting as a CE router.</t>

	<t hangText="4rd domain (Domain):">A set of 4rd CEs and BRs
	connected to the same virtual 4rd link. A service provider may
	deploy 4rd with a single 4rd domain, or may utilize multiple
	4rd domains. Each domain requires a separate 4rd prefix.</t>

	<t hangText="4rd Border Relay (BR):">A 4rd-enabled router
	managed by the service provider at the edge of a 4rd domain.
	A Border Relay router has at least one of each of the
	following: an IPv6-enabled interface, a 4rd virtual interface
	acting as an endpoint for the 4rd IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel, and an
	IPv4 interface connected to the native IPv4 network. A 4rd BR
	may also be referred to simply as a "BR" within the context of
	4rd.</t>

	<t hangText="4rd Customer Edge (CE):">A device functioning as
	a Customer Edge router in a 4rd deployment. In a residential
	broadband deployment, this type of device is sometimes
	referred to as a "Residential Gateway" (RG) or "Customer
	Premises Equipment" (CPE). A typical 4rd CE serving a
	residential site has one WAN side interface, one or more LAN
	side interfaces, and a 4rd virtual interface. A 4rd CE may
	also be referred to simply as a "CE" within the context of
	4rd.</t>

        <t hangText="CE IPv6 prefix:">The IPv6 prefix assigned to a CE by
	other means than 4rd itself, and used by 4rd to derive a CE 4rd
	prefix.</t>

        <t hangText="CE IPv6 address:">The IPv6 address given to the
        CE as part of normal IPv6 Internet access. This address is
        used by a 4rd CE to create the 4rd prefix as well as to send
        and receive IPv6-encapsulated IPv4 packets.</t>

        <t hangText="CE 4rd prefix:">The 4rd prefix of the CE. It is
        derived from the CE IPv6 prefix by a mapping rule according to
        <xref target="mapping-rules"></xref>. Depending on its length,
        it is an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address, or a shared IPv4
        address followed by a Port-set ID (<xref
        target="port-set-id"></xref>).</t>

        <t hangText="Port-set ID:">In a CE 4rd prefix longer than 32
        bits, bits that follow the first 32.  It algorithmically
        identifies a set of ports exclusively assigned to the CE. As
        specified in Section <xref target="port-set-id"></xref>, the set
        can comprise up to 4 disjoint port ranges.</t>

        <t hangText="Domain IPv6 prefix:">An IPv6 prefix assigned by an ISP to
	a 4rd domain.</t>

        <t hangText="Domain IPv4 prefix:">A 4rd prefix assigned by an
        ISP to the 4rd domain.</t>

        <t hangText="IPv4 Embedded Address (EA) bits:">The IPv4
        EA-bits in the IPv6 address identify an IPv4 prefix, IPv4
        address or part of IPv4 address and port set.</t>

	<t hangText="Shared IPv4 address:">An IPv4 address that is
	shared among multiple nodes. Each node has a separate part of
	the transport layer port space.</t>

      </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="4rd Configuration">
      <t>The IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or shared IPv4 address for use
      at a customer site is created by extracting the IPv4 embedded
      address (EA-bits) from the IPv6 prefix delegated to the
      site. Combined with the 4rd IPv4 prefix, the IPv4 prefix, IPv4
      address or shared IPv4 address is automatically created by the
      CE for the customer site when IPv6 service is obtained.</t>

      <t>For a given 4rd domain, the BR and CE MUST be configured with
      a set of mapping rules and BR IPv6 addresses. The configured
      values for these elements MUST be identical for all CEs and BRs
      within a given 4rd domain.</t>

      <t>A mapping rule consist of the following elements: a Domain
      IPv6 prefix and prefix length, a Domain 4rd prefix and prefix
      length, CE IPv6 Prefix length, and a Domain IPv6 suffix and length.
      See <xref target="mapping-rules">section</xref> for a detailed
      description of mapping rules.</t>

      <section title="Customer Edge Configuration">

	<t>The 4rd configuration elements are set to values that are the
	same across all CEs within a 4rd domain. The values may be
	configured in a variety of manners, including provisioning methods
	such as the Broadband Forum's "TR-69" [TR069] Residential Gateway
	management interface, an XML-based object retrieved after IPv6
	connectivity is established, a DNS record, an SMIv2 MIB [RFC2578],
	or manual configuration by an administrator. A companion document 
	<xref target='I-D.mrugalski-dhc-dhcpv6-4rd'></xref>describes how to
	configure the necessary parameters via IPv6 DHCP. A CE that allows
	IPv6 configuration by IPv6 DHCP SHOULD implement this option. Other
	configuration and management methods may use the format described by
	this option for consistency and convenience of implementation on CEs
	that support multiple configuration methods.</t>

	<t>The only remaining provisioning information the CE requires
	in order to calculate the 4rd address and enable IPv6
	connectivity is an IPv6 prefix for the CE. This CE IPv6 prefix
	is configured as part of obtaining IPv6 Internet access (i.e.,
	configured via SLAAC, DHCPv6, DHCPv6 PD, or otherwise).</t>

	<t>A single 4rd CE MAY be connected to more than one 4rd
	domain. Each domain a given CE operates within would require
	its own set of 4rd configuration elements and would generate
	its own 4rd address.</t>

          <t>A CE derives its CE 4rd prefix from the CE IPv6 prefix,
          using parameters of the applicable mapping rule. If the
          domain has several mapping rules, the rule that applies is
          that whose Domain IPv6 prefix has the longest match with the
          CE IPv6 prefix. As shown in Figure 1, the CE 4rd prefix is
          created by concatenating the Domain 4rd prefix with the IPv4
          EA-bits, where the IPv4 EA-bits is the remainder of the CE
          IPv6 prefix after the Domain IPv6 prefix (the length of the
          Domain IPv6 prefix is defined by the mapping rule).</t>

	  <t>In order to find whether a CE IPv6 address can be derived from an
	  IPv4 address, or an IPv4 address + a port, a mapping rule has to be
   	  found that matches the IPv4 information:</t>

	  <t><list style="symbols">
	    <t>If a mapping rule has a length L of CE IPv4 prefixes which does
            not exceed 32 bits, there is a match if the IPv4 address starts
            with the Domain 4rd prefix. The CE 4rd prefix is then the first L
            bits of the IPv4 address.</t>

	    <t>If a mapping rule has a length L of CE IPv4 prefixes which exceeds
            32 bits, the match can only be found with the IPv4 address and the
            port. For this, the port is examined to determine which port-
      	    range head it starts with: 1, 01,001, or 0001. The N bits that
            follow this head are taken as Port-set ID, where N is the length
            of Port set ID of the mapping rule. The CE 4rd prefix is then
            made of the IPv4 address followed by the Port-set ID.</t>
	  </list></t>

	  <t>If a match has been found, the CE IPv6 prefix is then made of the
	  Domain IPv6 prefix followed by bits of the CE 4rd prefix that
          follow the Domain 4rd prefix, followed by the Domain IPv6 prefix
          of the mapping rule if there is one, and followed by 0's up to 128
          bits to make a complete IPv6 address (<xref target="RFC4291"></xref>.

      <section anchor="fragmentation" title="Encapsulation and Fragmentation Consideration">
	<!-- <section title="Maximum Transmission Unit"> -->

	<t>Maximum transmission unit (MTU) and fragmentation issues
	for IPv4 in IPv6 tunneling are discussed in detail in Section
	7.2 of <xref target="RFC2473"></xref>. 4rd's scope is limited to
        a service provider network. IPv6 Path MTU discovery MAY be used
        to adjust the MTU of the tunnel as described in Section 7.2 of
	<xref target="RFC2473"></xref>, or the 4rd Tunnel MTU might be
        explicitly configured.</t>

	<t>The use of an anycast source address could lead to any ICMP
	error message generated on the path being sent to a different
	BR. Therefore, using dynamic tunnel MTU Section 7.2 of
        <xref target="RFC2473"></xref> is subject to IPv6 Path MTU
        blackholes.</t>

	<t>Multiple BRs using the same anycast source address could
	send fragmented packets to the same 4rd CE at the same time.
	If the fragmented packets from different BRs happen to use the
	same fragment ID, incorrect reassembly might occur. For this
	reason, a BR using an anycast source address MUST NOT fragment
        the IPv6 encapsulated packet.</t>

	<t>If the MTU is well-managed such that the IPv6 MTU on the CE
	WAN side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs
	within the boundary of the SP, then the 4rd Tunnel MTU should
	be set to the known IPv6 MTU minus the size of the
	encapsulating IPv6 header (40 bytes). For example, if the
	IPv6 MTU is known to be 1500 bytes, the 4rd Tunnel MTU might
	be set to 1460 bytes.  Absent more specific information, the
	4rd Tunnel MTU SHOULD default to 1280 bytes.</t>

	<t>For 4rd domain traversal, IPv4 packets are encapsulated in
	IPv6 packets whose Next header is set to 4 (i.e.  IPv4). If
	fragmentation of IPv6 packets is needed, it is performed
	according to <xref target="RFC2460"></xref>. Absent more specific
	information, the path MTU of a 4rd Domain has to be set to 1280
	<xref target="RFC2460"></xref>.</t>

	<t>In domains where IPv4 addresses are not shared, IPv6 destinations
	are derived from IPv4 addresses alone. Thus, each IPv4 packet can be
	encapsulated and decapsulated independently of each other. 4rd
	processing is completely stateless.</t>

	<t>On the other hand, in domains where IPv4 addresses are shared, BR's
	and CE's can have to encapsulate IPv4 packets whose IPv6 destinations
	depend on destination ports. Precautions are needed, due to the fact
	that the destination port of a fragmented datagram is available only
	in its first fragment. A sufficient precaution consists in
	reassembling each datagram received in multiple packets, and to treat
	it as though it would have been received in single packet. This
	function is such that 4rd is in this case stateful at the IP layer.
	(This is common with DS-lite and NAT64/DNS64 which, in addition, are
	stateful at the transport layer.)  At Domain entrance, this ensures
	that all pieces of all received IPv4 datagrams go to the right IPv6
	destinations.</t>

	<!-- *** A sender must rewrite it's identifier field to match -->
	<!-- part of its own port range. Replace below.  -->

	<t>Another peculiarity of shared IPv4 addresses is that, without
	precaution, a destination could simultaneously receive from different
	sources fragmented datagrams that have the same Datagram ID (the
	Identification field of <xref target="RFC0791"></xref>. 
	This would disturb the reassembly process. To eliminate this risk,
        CE MUST rewrite the datagram ID to an unique value among CEs having
        same shared IPv4 address upon sending the packets over 4rd tunnel.
        This value SHOULD be generated locally within the port-range assigned
	to a given CE. Note that replacing a Datagram ID in an IPv4 header
	implies an update of its Header-checksum fieald, by adding to it the
	one's complement difference between the old and the new values.</t>

      <t>ICMP message should be supported in 4rd domain. Hence, the
      NAT44 in 4rd CE must implement the behavior for ICMP message
      conforming to the best current practice documented in
      <xref target="RFC5508"></xref>.</t>

      <t> If a 4rd CE receives an ICMP message having ICMP identifier
      field in ICMP header, NAT44 in the 4rd CE must rewrite this
      field to a specific value assigned from the port-set described
      in <xref target="port-set"></xref>. BR and other CEs must handle
      this field similar to the port number in tcp/udp header upon
      receiving the ICMP message with ICMP identifier field.</t>

      <t>If a 4rd BR and CE receives an ICMP error message without
      ICMP identifier field for some errors that is detected inside
      a IPv6 tunnel, a 4rd BR and CE should replay the ICMP error
      message to the original source. This behavior should be
      implemented conforming to the section 8 of
      <xref target="RFC2473"></xref>. The 4rd BR and CE obtain the
      origianl IPv6 tunnel packet storing in ICMP payload and then
      decapsulate IPv4 packet. Finally the 4rd BR and CE generate
      a new ICMP error message from the decapsulated IPv4 packet
      and then forward it.</t>

      <t>If a 4rd BR receives an ICMP error message on its IPv4 interface,
      the 4rd BR should replay the ICMP message to an appropriate 4rd
      CE. If IPv4 address is not shared, the 4rd BR generates a CE IPv6
      address from the IPv4 destination address in the ICMP error message
      and encapsulates the ICMP message in IPv6. If IPv4 address is shared,
      the 4rd BR derives an original IPv4 packet from the ICMP payload and
      generates a CE IPv6 address from the source address and the source
      port in the original IPv4 packet. If the 4rd BR can generate the CE
      IPv6 address, the 4rd BR encapsulates the ICMP error message in IPv6

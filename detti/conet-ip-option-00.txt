              An IPv4 Option to support Content Networking
                     draft-detti-conet-ip-option-00

Abstract

   The Content Centric Networking paradigm, also known as Named Data
   Networking, shifts the focus of networking from providing connections
   between hosts to efficiently providing content to the users.  The
   work on CCN has traditionally been performed looking at "clean-slate"
   solutions which aims to replace IP with a new paradigm.  On the other
   hand, in this memo we propose an "integration" approach to Content
   Centric Networking, i.e. we extend the IP protocol using a new IP
   Option.  The new IP option is used by routers to support networking
   based on content rather than (or better in addition to) end-point
   addresses.

Internet-Draft             IP option for CONET                March 2011


1.  Introduction

   In this memo we propose a new approach to Content Centric Networking
   [Koponen07][Jacobson09], based on extending the IP protocol by using
   a new IP Option [RFC0791] called CONET IP option.  The CONET IP
   option can be used by routers to support content aware networking, in
   addition to classical address based networking.

   The CONET IP option is used to identify the content which is the
   object of the data transfer.  Its usage allows efficient in-network
   caching and replication of content.

   The architecture foresees end hosts, serving nodes and CONET nodes.
   End hosts require for content.  Serving nodes provide content.  CONET
   nodes: i) route requests from end hosts to serving nodes; ii) deliver
   content from serving nodes to end hosts; iii) may cache content and
   therefore provide it to end hosts without contacting the serving
   node.  CONET nodes can be further classified in Border nodes and
   Internal nodes.  Border nodes are able to perform both "routing-by-
   name" and caching, Internal nodes are not able to perform "routing-
   by-name" (but only plain IP routing) and can only perform caching.

   In addition to the new CONET IP option, the proposed solution needs a
   new Internet Protocol Number to identify the CONET protocol.


2.  CONET IP Option

   The CONET IP option has the following format:

   operations.

      0  No cache
      1  Cache

   Within Information Units that request for content (e.g. interest
   CIU), if the bit is set to "No cache" it indicates to the crossed
   nodes not to look for the content in the cache, but to forward the
   request toward the source.  Within Information Units that carry
   content (e.g. named-data CIU), if the bit is set to "No cache" it
   indicates to the crossed nodes not to cache the content.

   r : reserved - Two last bit of the first byte after the option length
   is reserved.

   NID : Network Identifier (NID) field - The NID it is a unique
   identifier for the content.  The NID is carried in the NID field.
   How to determine the length of this field is defined by the NID
   Length Specification field.  If the NID Length Specification field
   determines the field length, the NID field only carries the NID.  If
   the NID Length Specification field indicates that the field length is
   carried in the field itself, the NID field starts with a one byte
   field that determines its length.


   If NID Length Specification = 0 (i.e. 16 bytes len),
   the NID field is as follows:

                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                |                NID                |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                |                ...                |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                |                ...                |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+

   If NID Length Specification = 2 (i.e. NID starts with a one byte
   length field), the NID field is as follows:

                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                | length |        NID               |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                |                ...                |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                |                ...                |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+

   The NID starts with a two bytes field called NID namespace ID that
   determines the structure of the rest of the NID.  NID namespace
   values needs to be assigned by the IANA.  Note that in most

   circumstances, the NID can be processed by the routers as an opaque
   object, as described in Section 4.  This is why the NID namespace ID
   has been included at the beginning of the NID itself.  In other cases
   the nodes are requested to perform a routing-by-name procedure, which
   may require a semantic understanding of the NID.


                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                | NID namespace ID|       ...       |

                |                ...                |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+

   CSN : Chunk Sequence Number - This field carries the Chunk Sequence
   Number that identifies a portion of the content.  The assumption here
   is that the content is split in a sequence of smaller unit called
   "chunks".  The Chunk Sequence Number is represented with a variable
   number of bytes.  An initial bit pattern determines the length of the
   CSN field.

       |        |        |
       +--------+--------+


   Binary patterns from 11110010 to 11111111 are reserved.  They can be
   used to extend the CSN range if needed.  With the above defined
   option, we can have up to 2^40 chunks in a content.  Assuming a
   relatively small chunk size of 1 KBytes, it is possible to have a
   content of 1099 TeraBytes, while assuming a more reasonable chunk
   size of 256 Kbyte it is possible to have a content of 281474
   TeraBytes (218 PetaBytes).

   The rationale for having a variable length encoding is the following.
   The CSN range for a given content is determined by the content size
   divided by the chunk size.  As content of very different sizes can be
   transmitted, the CSN range can be very different.  Therefore it is
   not efficient to dimension this field considering the maximum number

   of chunks in which a content can be split.


3.  CONET protocol

   In the previous section, we have seen the description of the CONET IP
   option that is carried in the header of IP packets.  The payload of
   IP packets is the CONET protocol and a specific IP protocol number is
   assigned to it:

   CONET IP protocol number : xxx (to be assigned by IANA).

   The figure below shows the CONET protocol stack.  CONET protocol is
   divided in two sub-layers, whose data unit are respectively denoted
   as "Carrier Packets" and "CONET Information Units".  A CONET
   Information Unit (CIU) can be split into different Carrier Packets.
   Each Carrier Packet is transported by an IP packet.  There are
   different types of CONET Information Units, the CIU type information
   is carried in the CONET Information Unit Type field in the CONET IP
   option.


       +--------+--------+--------+ \
       | CONET Information Units  |  |
       +--------+--------+--------+  |- CONET protocol
       |     Carrier Packets      |  |
       +--------+--------+--------+ /
       | IP (with CONET IP option)|
       +--------+--------+--------+

   The generic structure of a Carrier Packet (CP) is reported hereafter:


       +-------------------------+
       |    CP Payload header    |
       +-------------------------+
       |       CP Payload        |
       +-------------------------+
       |      CP Path state      |
       +-------------------------+

   The information contained in the CP Payload header is specific for
   each CIU type.  It will be described in other specification
   documents.  The CP payload header contains the length of the CP
   Payload and allows to identify the start of the CP Path state field.
   The CP Path state field is used in end nodes, border nodes and
   serving nodes to assist in the forwarding operation of carrier
   packet, therefore it is described here.

Internet-Draft             IP option for CONET                March 2011


   The CP Path State field stores the end node address and the addresses
   of the set of crossed border nodes in the path from end node to the
   serving node (or to a border or intermediate node that provides a
   requested content).  The format of the CP path state field is
   reported hereafter (assuming that IPv4 addresses are carried).


       CP Path State field

                |0  len  | pointer| ad-type| addr 1 |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                | addr 2 | addr 3 | addr 4 | ad-type|
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                | addr 1 | addr 2 | addr 3 | addr 4 |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                |                ...                |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+

                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                |1      len       |     pointer     |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                | ad-type| addr 1 | addr 2 | addr 3 |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                | addr 4 | ad-type| addr 1 | addr 2 |
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                | addr 3 | addr 4 |
                +--------+--------+


   The length field specifies the length of the CP Path State field in
   bytes.  If the first bit of the len field is 0, the remaining 7 bits
   of the first byte are used as len field and both the length field and
   the pointer field are one byte length.  In this case the maximum
   value of the length of the CP Path State field is 127.  If the first
   bit of the len field is 1, both the length field and the pointer
   field are two bytes length.  In this case the maximum value of the
   length of the CP Path State field is 32767.

   The pointer field specifies the offset, starting from the start of
   the CP Path State field where the last address has been inserted.

   Each address is represented as a couple (ad-type, address) it could
   be represented by a triple (ad-type, ad-length, address) if the
   address type is of variable length.  The ad-type field is one bit
   size and currently admitted values are:

      1     Public IPv4 address (len is 4 bytes, no ad-length needed)

      3     Ethernet address (len is 6 bytes, no ad-length needed))
      4-255 Reserved

   Note that in the context of this document, only the IPv4 case is
   covered.  The definition of CONET protocols and procedures for IPv6
   and for direct mapping into Ethernet are out of the scope.

   Number of the required Content are respectively transported in the
   Network Identifier (NID) field and in the CSN field of the CONET IP
   option.  The end-node stores its IP address in CP path state field,
   initializing the pointer field.  Assuming for simplicity that the
   Interest CIU will fit into a single Carrier Packet, the Interest CIU
   will be included in the Carrier Packet that in turn is inserted into
   an IP packet.

   The end-node must now determine the destination IP address for the
   Carrier Packet.  The end-node performs a routing-by-name, trying to
   associate the NID with a next hop (i.e. with the IP address of the
   next hop).  The next hop can be the Serving Node (if the Serving node
   is in the same CONET subnet of the end-node) or a Border Node of the
   CONET subnet (if the Serving node is in a different CONET subnet).
   Typically the end-node does not participate to the routing-by-name
   protocols, therefore it cannot resolve the NID into the address of
   the next hop, but it has to ask a name server.  The name server is a
   part of the so called Name System.  Once this information is
   retrieved by the name server, the end-note can fill the IP
   destination address in the IP header and sends the packet.  The end-
   node may cache the mapping (NID -> next hop) into its memory as well.

4.1.2.  Processing in the serving node

   If the Serving Node is in the same CONET than the end-node, the
   serving node IP address will be used a destination IP address by the
   end-node.  The Serving node will receive an IP packet directed to
   itself, whose IP protocol number is "CONET".  Therefore the packet
   will be internally dispatched toward the "CONET entity" in the

Internet-Draft             IP option for CONET                March 2011


   Serving Node.  The CONET entity reads the CONET information unit type
   from the CONET IP options and recognizes that the received packet is
   an interest packet.  Then it reads the NID and Chunk Sequence Number
   in the CONET IP option, the NID will correspond to a content provided
   by the Serving Node.  The CONET entity will then process the CONET
   transport protocol information carried in the IP payload, which may
   for example specify a requested offset within the chunk.  Finally the
   CONET entity will respond to the interest packet by sending the
   requested named-data CIU.

4.1.3.  Processing in the border node

   If the Serving Node is in a different CONET than the end-node, the
   address of a CONET border node will be used a destination IP address
   by the end-node.  The border node will receive an IP packet directed
   to itself, whose IP protocol number is "CONET".  Therefore the packet
   will be internally dispatched toward the "CONET entity" in the border
   node.  The CONET entity reads the CONET information unit type from
   the CONET IP options and recognizes that the received packet is an
   interest packet.  Then it reads the NID and Chunk Sequence Number in
   the CONET IP option and is able to understand which content and which
   part of the available content it needs to provide.  If the Cache
   indication field is set to "No Cache" or if the field is set to
   "Cache" but the chunk is not available in the cache, the border node
   starts the routing-by-name process.  It will resolve the next hop of
   the interest packet, which can be a serving node in a different CONET
   subnet (with respect to the one from which the interest packet was
   received) connected to the Border Node, or another Border Node in the
   path toward the serving node.  Before sending out the packet, the
   border node adds its IP address in the CP Path State field and
   updates the pointer field.  Note that these procedures needs to be
   performed in the "fast path" of the border node (in this case the
   CONET entity in the border node can be seen as an integral part of
   the enhanced IP protocol).  If the Cache indication field is set to
   "Cache" and the border node has found that the chunk corresponding to
   the NID/CSN is available in its cache, the border node will process
   the CONET transport protocol information carried in the IP payload,
   which may for example specify a requested offset within the chunk and
   it will respond to the interest packet by sending the requested
   named-data CIU.

4.1.4.  Processing in the intermediate node

   When a packet is sent to the CONET next hop (as selected by the end
   node or by a border node) using the IP destination address of the
   next hop resolved by the routing-by-name, it can cross different IP
   routers in the path from the sending node and the next hop.  A
   crossed router that is aware of the CONET IP option, is a CONET

   intermediate node.  This node may have cached the the chunk that is
   requested by the interest packet.  The intermediate node works as
   follows.  When processing the IP header for the received packet, it
   finds that the packet contains the CONET IP option.  If the Cache
   indication field is set to "No Cache", the intermediate node forwards
   the packet using the destination IP address.  If the Cache indication
   field is set to "Cache", the intermediate node checks the presence of
   the chunk in its cache before forwarding the IP packet.  Therefore,
   it reads the NID and Chunk Sequence Number in the CONET IP option and
   checks if the chunk is present in its cache.  If the chunk is not
   present, the normal IP processing is continued.  Note that these
   operations needs to be performed in the "fast path" of the router and
   they only require information that is transported in the IP option.
   If the chunk is present in the CONET router cache, the router will
   process the CONET transport protocol information carried in the IP
   payload, which may for example specify a requested offset within the
   chunk and it will respond to the interest packet by sending the
   requested named-data CIU.

4.1.5.  Processing in the legacy routers

   When a packet is sent to the CONET next hop (as selected by the end
   node or by a border node) using the IP destination address of the
   next hop resolved by the routing-by-name, it can cross different IP
   routers in the path from the sending node and the next hop.  If a
   crossed router is a legacy router not aware of the CONET IP option,
   it will simply forward the packet looking at the IP destination
   address.  Note that a requirement for such legacy router is to be
   configured not to drop IP packets carrying unidentified IP options.

4.2.  Named data CONET Information Unit (Named data CIU)

4.2.1.  Processing in the responding node

   The responding node is the node that is able to provide a content
   (identified by NID and Chunk Sequence Number) to a requesting end-
   node.  Therefore the responding node can be a serving node which
   provides an original copy of the content, or a border node /
   intermediate node that provide a cached copy of the content.  The
   responding node will use the Path State information contained in the
   received carrier packet carrying the Interest CIU to route back the
   carrier packets containing the named-data CIU towards the requesting
   end-node.  In particular, it will use the pointer field to read the
   last address in the list and will use it as IP destination address
   for the Carrier packet carrying the named-data CIU.  We can denote
   this address as "CONET previous hop".  Then it will update the
   pointer field so that the next node will use the previous address in
   the list.  It may choose to strip the used address from the list in

   the CP Path state, thereby reducing the CP Path State field length.

4.2.2.  Processing in a border node

   The border node will receive an IP packet directed to itself, whose
   IP protocol number is "CONET".  Therefore the packet will be
   internally dispatched toward the "CONET entity" in the border node.
   The CONET entity reads the CONET information unit type from the CONET
   IP options and recognizes that the received packet is a named-data
   packet.  Again, we stress that this processing should be performed in
   the fast path.  Being a named-data packet, the border node will read
   the CP Path State field in the Carrier Packet and by using the
   pointer field will identify the CONET previous hop in the path
   towards the requesting end-node.  Before sending out the packet, it
   will update the pointer field in the CP Path State field.  The
   destination IP address of the packet will be set to the CONET
   previous hop retrieved from the CP Path State field.  If the Cache
   indication bit in the IP option is set to "Cache", the border node
   may choose to cache the CIU that is transported by the carried
   packet.  In this case, it is reccomended that the border node
   dispatches the packet as soon as possible and operates on a local
   copy to perform cache related operations.

4.2.3.  Processing in an intermediate node

   An intermediate node, i.e. a router in the path between a serving
   node or a border node and the CONET previous hop, which is aware of
   the CONET option, may decide to cache the named data CIU transported
   by a carrier packet.  The intermediate node will receive an IP packet
   with an IP destination equal to the CONET previous hop and will
   immediately forward this packet using IP routing.  Then, if the Cache
   indication bit in the IP option is set to "Cache", the intermediate
   node may choose to cache the CIU that is transported by the carried
   packet.

4.2.4.  Processing in the legacy routers

   When a packet is sent to the CONET previous hop (as selected by the
   serving node or by a border node) using the IP destination address of
   the previous hop obtained using the CP Path State information, it can
   cross different IP routers in the path from the sending node and the
   previous hop.  If a crossed router is a legacy router not aware of
   the CONET IP option, it will simply forward the packet looking at the
   IP destination address.  Note that a requirement for such legacy
   router is to be configured not to drop IP packets carrying
   unidentified IP options.

5.  Routing by name framework

   The routing-by-name process is performed in the end-node and in
   border nodes in order to resolve a NID into the next hop towards a
   serving node for the given NID.  This document provides a framework
   under which the routing-by-name procedures can be performed, and
   assures that different routing-by-name procedures and approaches may
   coexist.  These different approaches needs to be separately
   specified.  The format and the semantic of the NID may need to be
   specified when defining a specific routing-by-name approach.  This is
   made possible by the concept of NID name space ID, which is carried
   within the NID.

   The basic procedure that a routing-by-name framework needs to offer
   is called resolveNID, it takes as input the NID and returns the
   next_hop_address.  This procedure is performed by end-nodes and by
   border nodes that are not able to provide a cached response for a
   content requested by an end node.

   resolveNid (NID) -> next_hop_address

   The tables on which the routing-by-name procedures are based are
   populated by serving nodes and by border nodes.  The procedure is
   initiated by serving nodes that advertize the hosted content with the
   advertizeNID procedure.  In turn, the procedure is replicated by the
   border nodes that spread the received advertising toward other border
   nodes.  This procedure takes as input a NID, the address of the node
   performing the procedure, and the path information towards the
   serving node as seen by the node performing the procedure.  Depending
   on the specific routing-by-name approach, the path information can be
   simply an hop count, or it could be the path list (as in the BGP AS-
   PATH).

   advertizeNid (NID, node_address, path_info)

   In the following section we define two CONET default name spaces.  It
   could be more appropriate that in future version of this document
   this specification is provided in a separate document.


6.  CONET default namespaces

   We define two default NID name spaces for CONET, one is based on
   variable length strings as NID, as it was proposed in [Jacobson09],
   the second one is based on fixed length hashes.  The two namespaces
   are assigned the following NID name space IDs.

   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Namespace ID |                                                 |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |        1     | VLL (Variable Length Label) NID namespace       |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |        2     | PLHB (Principal/Label Hash Based) NID namespace |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+


   In the VLL (Variable Length Label) CONET namespace the NID is simply
   the string representation of a resource.  As described in
   [Jacobson09] NIDs are hierarchically structured so that an individual
   name is composed of a number of components (see [Jacobson09] for
   further details.  An authority is needed to ensure the uniqueness of
   the NIDs.  The approach should be similar on how the uniqueness of
   DNS names is granted in today's Internet.

   In the Principal/Label Hash Based CONET namespace the NID is the
   composition of two hash values, as follows:

   NID = ( hash (Principal) , hash (Label) )

   In the Principal/Label Hash Based CONET namespace the Hash(principal)
   is a 8 bytes hash of a string representing the Principal.  The Label
   is a 6 bytes hash of a string representing the label.  A central
   authority is needed to ensure the uniqueness of the Hash(principal),
   i.e. a Principal cannot be assigned if its hash collides with an
   already assigned hash.  The Principal is responsible to ensuring that
   each Hash(Label) belonging to the Principal are unique.  Therefore a
   Label cannot be used by a Principal if its hash collides with the
   Hash of an already used Label.

8.  Performance Considerations

   IP Options have often been criticized because their support in
   current routers would impose a performance penalty, but we can assume
   here that routers will be modified to support Content Centric
   Networking.  Compared with "clean slate" approaches where CCN nodes
   could be completely different with respect to routers, we believe
   that we are able to provide all the functionality we need for Content
   Centric Networking, with reasonable modification in router

   architectures and preserving all the functionality of current IP
   networking.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the allocation of one IP option by the IANA.

   This document requires the allocation of one IP protocol number by
   the IANA.

   This document requires that IANA will maintain the registry of CONET
   namespaces.

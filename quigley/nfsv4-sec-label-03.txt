                  draft-quigley-nfsv4-sec-label-03.txt

Abstract

   This Internet-Draft describes additions to NFSv4 minor version one to
   support Mandatory Access Control systems.  The current draft
   describes the mechanism for transporting a MAC security label using
   the NFSv4.1 protocol and the semantics required for that label.  In
   addition to this it describes an example system of using this label
   in a fully MAC aware environment.

Internet-Draft    MAC Security Label Support for NFSv4        March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have been mainstreamed in
   modern operating systems such as Linux (R), FreeBSD (R), Solaris
   (TM), and Windows Vista (R).  MAC systems bind security attributes to
   subjects (processes) and objects within a system.  These attributes
   are used with other information in the system to make access control
   decisions.

   Access control models such as Unix permissions or Access Control
   Lists are commonly refered to as Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
   models.  These systems base their access decisions on user identity
   and resource ownership.  In contrast MAC models base their access
   control decisions on the label on the subject (usually a process) and
   the object it wishes to access.  These labels may contain user
   identity information but usually contain additional information.  In
   DAC systems users are free to specify the access rules for resources
   that they own.  MAC models base their security decisions on a system
   wide policy established by an administrator or organization which the
   users do not have the ability to override.  DAC systems offer no real
   protection against malicious or flawed software due to each program
   running with the full permissions of the user executing it.
   Inversely MAC models can confine malicious of flawed software and
   usually act at a finer granularity than their DAC counterparts.

   People desire to use NFSv4 with these systems.  A mechanism is
   required to provide security attribute information to NFSv4 clients
   and servers.  This mechanism has the following requirements:

   o  Clients must be able to convey to the server the security
      attribute of the subject making the access request.  The server
      may provide a mechanism to enforce MAC policy based on the
      requesting subject's security attribute.

   o  Server must be able to store and retrieve the security attribute
      of exported files as requested by the client.

   o  Server must provide a mechanism for notifying clients of attribute
      changes of files on the server.

   o  Clients and Servers must be able to negotiate Label Formats and
      Domains of Interpretation (DOI) and provide a mechanism to
      translate between them as needed.

   These four requirements are key to the system with only requirements
   two and three requiring changes to NFSv4.1.  The ability to convey
   the security attribute of the subject as described in requirement one
   falls upon the RPC layer to implement.  Requirement four allows

   communication between different MAC implementations.  The management
   of label formats, DOIs and the translation between them does not
   require any support from NFS on a protocol level and is out of the
   scope of this document.


2.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Label Format Specifier: An identifier used by the client to establish
   the syntactic format of the security label and the semantic meaning
   of its components.  These specifiers exist in a registry associated
   with documents describing the format and semantics of the label.

   Label Format Registry: The IANA registry containing all registered
   Label Format Specifiers along with references to the documents that
   describe the syntactic format and semantics of the security label.

   Policy Identifier: An optional part of the definition of a Label
   Format Specifier which allows for clients and server to identify
   specific security policies.

   Domain of Interpretation: A Domain of Interpretation (DOI) represents
   an administrative security boundary, where all systems within the DOI
   have semantically coherent labeling.  That is, a security attribute
   must always mean exactly the same thing anywhere within the DOI.

   Object: An object is a passive resource within the system that we
   wish to be protected.  Objects can be entities such as files,
   directories, pipes, sockets, and many other system resources relevant
   to the protection of the system state.

   Subject: A subject is an active entity usually a process which is
   requesting access to an object.


3.  MAC Security Attribute

   MAC models base access decisions on security attributes bound to
   subjects and objects.  This information can range from a user
   identity for an identity based MAC model, sensitivity levels for
   Multi-level security, or a type for Type Enforcement.  These models
   base their decisions on different criteria but the semantics of the
   security attribute remain the same.  The semantics required by the
   security attributes are listed below:



Quigley & Morris       Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 4]

   o  Must provide flexibility with respect to MAC model.

   o  Must provide the ability to atomically set security information
      upon object creation

   o  Must provide the ability to enforce access control decisions both
      on the client and the server

   o  Must not expose an object to either the client or server name
      space before its security information has been bound to it.

   NFSv4 provides several options for implementing the security
   attribute.  The first option is to implement the security attribute
   as a named attribute.  Named attributes provide flexibility since
   they are treated as an opaque field but lack a way to atomically set
   the attribute on creation.  In addition, named attributes themselves
   are file system objects which need to be assigned a security
   attribute.  This raises the question of how to assign security
   attributes to the file and directories used to hold the security
   attribute for the file in question.  The inability to atomically
   assign the security attribute on file creation and the necessity to
   assign security attributes to its subcomponents makes named
   attributes unacceptable as a method for storing security attributes.

   The second option is to implement the security attribute as a
   recommended attribute as defined in section 5.2 of RFC 3530.
   Recommended attributes have a fixed format and semantics, which
   conflicts with the flexible nature of the security attribute.  To
   resolve this the security attribute consists of two components.  The
   first component is a Label Format Specifier(LFS) as defined in [XXX:
   Insert Doc here] to allow for interoperability between MAC
   mechanisms.  The second component is an opaque field which the actual
   security attribute data.  To allow for various MAC models NFSv4
   should be used solely as a transport mechanism for the security
   attribute.  It is the responsibility of the endpoints to consume the
   security attribute and make access decisions based on their
   respective models.  In addition, creation of objects through OPEN and
   CREATE allows for the security attribute to be specified upon
   creation.  By providing an atomic create and set operation for the
   security attribute it is possible to enforce the second and fourth
   requirements.  To this end the attribute number XXX:ATTRNUM is
   requested for the security_attribute recommended attribute.

3.1.  Interpreting security_attribute

   The security_attribute field contains two components the first
   component being an LFS.  The LFS serves to provide the receiving end
   with the information necessary to translate the security attribute



Quigley & Morris       Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    MAC Security Label Support for NFSv4        March 2011


   into a form that is usable by the endpoint.  Label Formats assigned
   an LFS may optionally choose to include a Policy Identifier (PI)
   field to allow for complex policy deployments.  The Label Format
   Specifier and Label Format Registry are described in detail in [XXX:
   Insert RFC Here].  The translation used to interpret the security
   attribute is not specified as part of the protocol as it may depend
   on various factors.  The second component is an opaque section which
   contains the data of the attribute.  This component is dependent on
   the MAC model to interpret and enforce.  The character '@' is
   reserved as a separator between the LFS and opaque section of the
   security attribute.

3.2.  Delegations

   In the event that a security attribute is changed on the server while
   a client holds a delegation on the file, the client should follow the
   existing protocol with respect to attribute changes.  It should flush
   all changes back to the server and relinquish the delegation.

3.3.  Permission Checking

   It is not feasible to enumerate all possible MAC models and even
   levels of protection within a subset of these models.  This means
   that the NFSv4 client and servers can not be expected to directly
   make access control decisions based on the security attribute.
   Instead NFSv4 should defer permission checking on this attribute to
   the host system.  These checks are performed in addition to existing
   DAC and ACL checks outlined in the NFSv4 protocol.  Section 4 gives a
   specific example of how the security attribute is handled under a
   particular MAC model.

3.4.  Object Creation

   When creating files in NFSv4 the OPEN and CREATE operations are used.
   One of the parameters to these operations is an fattr4 structure
   containing the attributes the file is to be created with.  This
   allows NFSv4 to atomically set the security attribute of files upon
   creation.  When a client is MAC aware it must always provide the
   initial security attribute upon file creation.  In the event that the
   server is the only MAC aware entity in the system it should ignore
   the security attribute specified by the client and instead make the
   determination itself.  A more in depth explanation can be found in
   Section 4.


4.  MAC Security NFS Modes of Operation

   A system using Labeled NFS may operate in three modes.  The first



Quigley & Morris       Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    MAC Security Label Support for NFSv4        March 2011


   mode provides the most protection and is called "full" mode.  In this
   mode both the client and server implement a MAC model allowing each
   end to make an access control decision.  The remaining two modes are
   variations on each other and are called "smart client" and "smart
   server" modes.  In these modes one end of the connection is not
   implementing a MAC model and because of this these operating modes
   offer less protection than full mode.

4.1.  Full Mode

   Full mode environments consist of MAC aware NFSv4 servers and clients
   and may be composed of mixed MAC models and policies.  The system
   requires that both the client and server have an opportunity to
   perform an access control check based on all relevant information
   within the network.  The file object security attribute is provided
   using the mechanism described in Section 3.  The security attribute
   of the subject making the request is transported at the RPC layer
   using the mechanism described in XXX: Insert RFC for RPC layer label
   draft.

4.1.1.  Initial Labeling and Translation

   The ability to create a file is an action that a MAC model may wish
   to mediate.  The client is given the responsibility to determine the
   initial security attribute to be placed on a file.  This allows the
   client to make a decision as to the acceptable security attributes to
   create a file with before sending the request to the server.  Once
   the server receives the creation request from the client it may
   choose to evaluate if the security attribute is acceptable.

   Security attributes on the client and server may vary based on MAC
   model and policy.  To handle this the security attribute field has an
   LFS component.  This component is a mechanism for the host to
   identify the format and meaning of the opaque portion of the security
   attribute.  A full mode environment may contain hosts operating in
   several different LFSs and DOIs.  In this case a mechanism for
   translating the opaque portion of the security attribute is needed.
   The actual translation function will vary based on MAC model and
   policy and is out of the scope of this document.  If a translation is
   unavailable for a given LFS and DOI then the request SHOULD be
   denied.  Another recource is to allow the host to provide a fallback
   mapping for unknown security attributes.

4.1.2.  Policy Enforcement

   In full mode access control decisions are made by both the clients
   and servers.  When a client makes a request it takes the security
   attribute from the requesting process and makes an access control



Quigley & Morris       Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    MAC Security Label Support for NFSv4        March 2011


   decision based on that attribute and the security attribute of the
   object it is trying to access.  If the client denies that access an
   RPC call to the server is never made.  If however the access is
   allowed the client will make a call to the NFS server.

   When the server receives the request from the client it extracts the
   security attribute conveyed in the RPC request.  The server then uses
   this security attribute and the attribute of the object the client is
   trying to access to make an access control decision.  If the server's
   policy allows this access it will fulfill the client's request,
   otherwise it will return NFS4ERR_ACCESS

   Implementations MAY validate security attributes supplied over the
   network to ensure that they are within a set of attributes permitted
   from a specific peer, and if not, reject them.  Note that a system
   may permit a different set of attributes to be accepted from each
   peer.  An example of this can be seen in Section 5.1.1.

4.2.  Smart Client Mode

   Smart client environments consist of NFSv4 servers that are not MAC
   aware but NFSv4 clients that are.  Clients in this environment are
   may consist of groups implementing different MAC models policies.
   The system requires that all clients in the environment be
   responsible for access control checks.  Due to the amount of trust
   placed in the clients this mode is only to be used in a trusted
   environment.

4.2.1.  Initial Labeling and Translation

   Just like in full mode the client is responsible for determining the
   initial label upon object creation.  The server in smart client mode
   does not implement a MAC model, however, it may provide the ability
   to restrict the creation and labeling of object with certain labels
   based on different criteria as described in Section 4.1.2.

   In a smart client environment a group of clients operate in a single
   DOI.  This removes the need for the clients to maintain a set of DOI
   translations.  Servers should provide a method to allow different
   groups of clients to access the server at the same time.  However it
   should not let two groups of clients operating in different DOIs to
   access the same files.

4.2.2.  Policy Enforcement

   In smart client mode access control decisions are made by the
   clients.  When a client accesses an object it obtains the security
   attribute of the object from the server and combines it with the



Quigley & Morris       Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    MAC Security Label Support for NFSv4        March 2011


   security attribute of the process making the request to make an
   access control decision.  This check is in addition to the DAC checks
   provided by NFSv4 so this may fail based on the DAC criteria even if
   the MAC policy grants access.  As the policy check is located on the
   client an access control denial should take the form that is native
   to the platform.

4.3.  Smart Server Mode

   Smart server environments consist of NFSv4 servers that are MAC aware
   and one or more MAC unaware clients.  The server is the only entity
   enforcing policy, and may selectively provide standard NFS services
   to clients based on their authentication credentials and/or
   associated network attributes (e.g.  IP address, network interface).
   The level of trust and access extended to a client in this mode is
   configuration-specific.

4.3.1.  Initial Labeling and Translation

   In smart server mode all labeling and access control decisions are
   performed by the NFSv4 server.  In this environment the NFSv4 clients
   are not MAC aware so they can not provide input into the access
   control decision.  This requires the server to determine the initial
   labeling of objects.  Normally the subject to use in this calculation
   would originate from the client.  Instead the NFSv4 server may choose
   to assign the subject security attribute based on their
   authentication credentials and/or associated network attributes (e.g.
   IP address, network interface).

   In smart server mode security attributes are contained solely within
   the NFSv4 server.  This means that all security attributes used in
   the system remain within a single LFS and DOI.  Since security
   attributes will not cross DOIs or change format there is no need to
   provide any translation functionality above that which is needed
   internally by the MAC model.

4.3.2.  Policy Enforcement

   All access control decisions in smart server mode are made by the
   server.  The server will assign the subject a security attribute
   based on some criteria (e.g.  IP address, network interface).  Using
   the newly calculated security attribute and the security attribute of
   the object being requested the MAC model makes the access control
   check and returns NFS4ERR_ACCESS on a denial and NFS4_OK on success.
   This check is done transparently to the client so if the MAC
   permission check fails the client may be unaware of the reason for
   the permission failure.  When operating in this mode administrators
   attempting to debug permission failures should be aware to check the

   MAC policy running on the server in addition to the DAC settings.


5.  Examples

   The section below outlines an example of the Labeled NFS operation
   modes using a traditional Multi Level Security(MLS) model where
   objects are given a sensitivity level (Unclassified, Secret, Top
   Secret etc..) and a category set.  This is just one example of a
   possible MAC model and is not required by labeled NFS
   implementations.

5.1.  Multi-Level Security

   In a Multi-level security (MLS) system objects are generally assigned
   a sensitivity level, and a set of compartments.  The sensitivity
   levels within the system are given an order ranging from lowest to
   highest classification level.  Read access to an object is allowed
   when the sensitivity level of the subject "dominates" the object it
   wants to access.  This means that the sensitivity level of the
   subject is higher than that of the object it wishes to access and
   that its set of compartments is a super-set of the compartments on
   the object.

   The rest of the section will just use sensitivity levels.  In general
   the example is a client that wishes to list the contents of a
   directory.  The system defines the sensitivity levels
   Unclassified(U), Secret(S), and Top Secret(TS).  The directory to be
   searched is labeled Top Secret which means access to read the
   directory will only be granted if the subject making the request is
   also labeled Top Secret.

5.1.1.  Full Mode

   In the first part of this example a process on the client is running
   at the Secret level.  The process issues a readdir system call which
   enters the kernel.  Before translating the readdir system call into a
   request to the NFSv4 server the host operating system will consult
   the MAC module to see if the operation is allowed.  Since the process
   is operating at Secret and the directory to be accessed is labeled
   Top Secret the MAC module will deny the request and an error code is
   returned to user space.

   Consider a second case where instead of running at Secret the process
   is running at Top Secret.  In this case the sensitivity of the
   process is equal to or greater than that of the directory so the MAC
   module will allow the request.  Now the readdir is translated into
   the necessary NFSv4 call to the server.  For the RPC request the



Quigley & Morris       Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    MAC Security Label Support for NFSv4        March 2011


   client is using the proper credential to assert to the server that
   the process is running at Top Secret.

   When the server receives the request it extracts the security label
   from the RPC session and retrieves the label on the directory.  The
   server then checks with its MAC module if a Top Secret process is
   allowed to read the contents of the Top Secret directory.  Since this
   is allowed by the policy then the server will return the appropriate
   information back to the client.

   In this example the policy on the client and server were both the
   same.  In the event that they were running different policies a
   translation of the labels might be needed.  In this case it could be
   possible for a check to pass on the client and fail on the server.
   The server may consider additional information when making its policy
   decisions.  For example the server could determine that a certain
   subnet is only cleared for data up to Secret classification.  If that
   constraint was in place for the example above the client would still
   succeed, but the server would fail since the client is asserting a
   label that it is not able to use (Top Secret on a Secret network).

5.1.2.  Smart Client Mode

   In smart client mode the example is identical to the first part of a
   full mode operation.  A process on the client labeled Secret wishes
   to access a Top Secret directory.  As in the full mode example this
   is denied since Secret does not dominate Top Secret.  If the process
   were operating at Top Secret it would pass the local access control
   check and the NFSv4 operation would proceed as in a normal NFSv4
   environment.

5.1.3.  Smart Server Mode

   In a smart server mode the client behaves as if it were in a normal
   NFSv4 environment.  Since the process on the client does not provide
   a security attribute the server must define a mechanism for labeling
   all requests from a client.  Assume that the server is using the same
   criteria used in the full mode example.  The server sees the request
   as coming from a subnet that is a Secret network.  The server
   determines that all clients on that subnet will have their requests
   labeled with Secret.  Since the directory on the server is labeled
   Top Secret and Secret does not dominate Top Secret the server would
   fail the request with NFS4ERR_ACCESS.


6.  Security Considerations

   Depending on the level of protection the MAC system offers there may

      Addresses (CGA) and in the Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
                  draft-cheneau-csi-ecc-sig-agility-01

Abstract

   This draft describes a mechanism to deploy Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography (ECC) alongside with Cryptographically Generated
   Addresses (CGA) and the Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND).  This
   document provides basic skeleton to integrate new signature
   algorithms in CGA and SEND.

Internet-Draft   ECC PK and sig. support in CGA and SEND   November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The usage scenarios associated with neighbor discovery have recently
   been extended to include environments with mobile or nomadic nodes.
   Many of these nodes have limited battery power and computing
   resources.  Therefore, heavy public key signing algorithms like RSA
   are not feasible to support on such constrained nodes.  Fortunately,
   more lightweight yet secure signing algorithms do exist and have been
   standardized, e.g.  Elliptic Curve based algorithms.

   It is then a worthwhile goal to extend secure neighbor discovery to
   support this signing algorithm.

   The aim of this memo is to outline options for allowing Elliptic
   Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for nodes configured to perform
   secure neighbor discovery operations.  The present document exposes
   how to use and deploy Elliptic Curve Cryptography in [RFC3972] and
   [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility].  It should be noted that the latter
   document has impacts on existing specification [RFC3971].

2.  Choice of Elliptic Curve

   This document follows NIST's recommendation on the usage of various
   Elliptic Curves as per [FIPS-186-3].  For the sake of simplicity,
   this document only describes the use of three proposed curves, namely
   curve P-256 (aka secp256r1), curve P-384 (aka secp384r1) and curve
   P-521 (aka secp521r1).

3.  Using ECC in CGA

   The CGA generation and verification processes remain unmodified from
   the processes described in [RFC3972].  However, we extend section 3
   of [RFC3972], as it contains RSA specific text.  We add that, when
   ECDSA is used, the AlgorithmIdentifier, contained in ASN.1 structure
   of type SubjectPublicKeyInfo, must be the (unrestricted) id-
   ecPublicKey algorithm identifier, which is OID 1.2.840.10045.2.1, and
   the subjectPublicKey MUST be formatted as an ECC Public Key,
   specified in Section 2.2 of [RFC5480].

   Note that the ECC key lengths are determined by the namedCurves
   parameter stored in ECParameters field of the AlgorithmIdentifier.

4.  Signature Type Identifier for ECC

   In the document [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility], a field named
   Signature Type Identifier is used by the Supported Signature
   Algorithm Option and the Universal Signature Option (that replaces
   the RSA Signature Option).  This field indicates the Signature
   Algorithm available on the node to generate or verify the Digital
   Signature field of the Universal Signature Option.

   This document describes new values for three different signature
   algorithms.  These values are extracted from the IANA-defined numbers
   for the IKEv2 protocol, i.e.  IANA registry named "IKEv2
   Authentication Method" and are the following:

   o  Value 9 is ECDSA with SHA-256 on the P-256 curve

   o  Value 10 is ECDSA with SHA-384 on the P-384 curve

   o  Value 11 is ECDSA with SHA-512 on the P-521 curve

5.  Using ECDSA with Universal Signature Option

   The document [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility] proposes the Universal
   Signature Option (extended from the RSA Signature Option of
   [RFC3971]).  This option adds a new Signature Type Identifier field
   that identifies the signature algorithm used during the generation of
   the digital signature field.

   When the value of the Signature Type Identifier field is 9, 10 or 11,
   this Digital Signature field is computed and verified using the ECDSA
   signature algorithm (as defined on [SEC1]) and hash function
   corresponding to the Signature Type Identifier field.  The data on
   which the signature is performed are described in
   [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility].

6.  Security Considerations

   This memo defines the usage of the ECC Public Key and Signature
   Algorithm in CGA and SEND.  Table 1 (from [SP800-57]), presents a
   comparison between the length of the RSA keys and their equivalent
   (security-wise) ECC keys.

   Table 3: Common sizes of the Digital Signature field when using ECDSA
                             (+ DER encoding)

   Appendix A of document [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility] emphasises the
   impact of the Public Key size and the number of Universal Signature
   Options on size of the final message.  This Appendix proposes to
   extend previous document and to add values for ECC.  Table 2 provides
   size for the commonly used DER-encoded ECC Public Keys.  Table 3
   presents common sizes for Digital Signature field when using ECDSA.

   Reusing the value computed in [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility], we
   deduce that a Router Advertisement carrying a Prefix Information
   Option and a Source Link-Layer Option sent from a CGA formed with a
   P-256 EC Public and protected by a corresponding ECDSA signature is
   328 bytes long.  This can be compared with the same message using a
   CGA carrying a 1024 bits RSA whose length is 456 bytes.

Appendix B.  Note for future work

   When specifying a new type of Signature Algorithm, a new draft may
   reuse the skeleton of this document by replacing ECC/ECDSA by the
   appropriate terminology.  In this case, the new draft should include
   an appendix similar to Appendix A for a comparison with already
   specified signature algorithms.

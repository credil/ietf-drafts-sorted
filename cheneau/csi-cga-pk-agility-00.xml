      <t> This document defines an extension field for the CGA Parameters data structure specified in RFC 3972.  This extension field carries a Public Key that is used in Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) generation. This extension enables protocols using CGAs, such as SEND, to use multiple Public Key signing algorithms and/or multiple Public Keys.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>   	Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) <xref target="RFC3972"/> have been
			designed  to provide a binding of an internet address (IPv6) to a public key. A node who claims to own
			a particular IPv6 address, can prove so in the messages (e.g. ICMP) it sends by using 
		               a digital signature for authentication and integrity protection.  Since the IPv6 address was generated from 
			the public key, verification of the  respective signature is tantamount to verification of ownership of the claimed IPv6 address. </t>
      <t> 	CGAs <xref target="RFC3972"/> were defined to only use RSA as the associated signature algorithm. 
			Only one RSA public key is associated with a CGA and this public key  is carried in 
			the Public Key field of the CGA Parameters data structure. 
	</t>
      <!--<t>	As a matter of example, the Secure Neighbor Discovery protocol (strongly based on the CGA)  usage scenarios have recently been extended 
			to include environments with mobile or nomadic nodes. These nodes can often be
			limited in power and memory capabilities, and thus may only be able to support
			lightweight public key cryptography; that is, RSA-based public keys and algorithm 
			support may not be feasible. </t>  -->
      <t>     	Due to the expected variations in cryptographic ability of IPv6 nodes, 
			support for signature algorithm agility in CGA is desired. However, 
			since the CGA specification <xref target="RFC3972"/> states that SEND "SHOULD" 
			use an RSA public/private key pair,  backward compatibility must be preserved herein.   
		</t>
      <t>	A logical place for extending the CGA Parameters data structure to include other
			types of public keys is its "extension fields". Some guidance on the format of 
			these extensions is provided in <xref target="RFC4581"/>.
			One type of CGA Parameters data structure extension is defined in 
			<xref target="sec-PK_ext"/> and this type of extension is able to carry public keys,
			in addition to the RSA public key defined in the Public Key field of CGA Parameters data structure.  
		</t>
      <t>
			These extensions support new functionnalities for CGA based protocols, such as the Signature Algorithm Agility in SEND <xref target="cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility"/>.
			</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sec-PK_ext" title="Public Key extension">
      <t>This section describes an extension field that conforms to the guidelines of <xref target="RFC4581"/>.</t>
      <t>This extension allows a CGA Parameters data structure to carry  public keys in addition to the key in the Public Key field. 
			This approach paves the way for one CGA to possibly be associated with multiple public keys.</t>
      <t>This extension allows a node to select a Public Key value that is different from the one in the Public Key field of the CGA Parameters data 
			structure option. This Public Key is placed in an extension embedded in the Extension field of the CGA Parameters data structure,
			described in <xref target="RFC3972"/>.</t>

      <t> When a node supports two or more types of signing algorithms, and is able to generate two or more corresponding public keys, 
				then it can derive a single CGA using all these keys. The  derivation is done exactly as in <xref target="RFC3972"/>; one key is
				placed in the CGA Parameters data structure "Public Key" field  while the rest of the keys are  placed in separate extension fields,
                              as illustrated in <xref target="multi-cga"/>.
				Thus generation and verification of CGA as defined in Section 4 and Section 5 of <xref target="RFC3972"/> remain unchanged.
	</t>
      <t>It should be noted that the type of the public key (RSA, ECC, etc.) is already encoded into the 
			"Public Key" field itself, and thus there is no need to identify the public key type separately. This is due to the fact that the "Public Key" field, according to
			<xref target="RFC3972"/> is a DER-encoded ASN.1 structure of the type "SubjectPublicKeyInfo", and therefore
			includes a subfield called "AlgorithmIdentifier".

		<t> The resulting CGA Parameters data structure is inserted into a CGA option as per <xref target="RFC3971"/>. 
				When sending a NDP packet, the node includes this CGA option and also one signature option of choice,
				computed with a private key whose corresponding Public Key is present in the CGA Parameters data structure.
				This signature option can be the RSA signature option as per <xref target="RFC3971"/>,
			or another signature option, e.g. the Universal Signature option as per <xref target="cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility"/>,
			or any other signature defined. The signature option contains the hash of the key used to sign
				the message. 
			</t> -->
      <t>Note that an implementation should choose the number of simultaneous Public Key Extension fields used so as the
			total length of the extension fields does not exceed a threshold that requires fragmentation support at the
			SEND or other upper-layer protocol.
			</t>
      <t>Support for RSA Public Keys and signature algorithm is only RECOMMENDED for backward compatibility. 
			This specification does not mandate support for any particular public key signature algorithm. 
			Therefore, nodes can be configured to choose/support only a single additional signature algorithm 
			besides RSA. However, a node is also free to not support RSA and still claim 
			compatibility with this specification. 
		</t>
		<section title="Specific usage with SEND">
			
			<t><xref target="RFC3972"/>  recommends the use of RSA  keys in the Public Key field when using SEND <xref target="RFC3971"/>. A node compatible with
				<xref target="RFC3972"/> will only extract the RSA public key from the Public Key field and ignore the extension fields.
				Therefore, in order to achieve backward compatibility, if a node uses a CGA associated with multiple public keys (through 
				the use of the Public Key extension), the following procedures are in place: if one of the public keys is of RSA type, 
				then that key SHOULD be placed in the Public Key field of the CGA Parameters data structure, while the other
				key(s) SHOULD  be placed in the Extension field(s).  
				<!-- M.M there should be a section "CGA parsing process" explaining how a receiver interpret a received CGA, for the -01 version

            <t>This document describes a method for binding a public signature key to an IPv6 address in the Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol.  Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses for which the interface identifier is generated by computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and auxiliary parameters.  The binding between the public key and the address can be verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with the interface identifier.  Messages sent from an IPv6 address can be protected by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and by signing the message with the corresponding private key.  The protection works without a certification authority or any security infrastructure. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

Abstract

   In instant messaging system, it is useful to have some readily
   available IM (text, audio or video) which can be sent in case of the
   receiver is too busy to type/speak/record for a reply.  These short
   IM (here after referred as QA - Quick Answer) can be created, stored
   and used when needed.  This document defines a new QA content type
   and XML namespace that conveys QA between two entities.  The QAs are
   delivered to the instant messaging sender in the same manner as the
   instant messages themselves.

Internet-Draft                Quick Answer                      May 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Instant Messaging conversation there may be some situation where
   receiver is unable to compose (type, speak) an IM in reply at that
   point of time.  However, due to the importance of the topic discussed
   and the sender himself, he also doesn't want the sender to feel
   avoided or left waiting for long time.

   To solve this issue this document proposes the concept of "Quick
   Answer" (QA), which are some readily available IM (text, audio,
   video) to the user, from which user can select as a reply to the
   sender.  QAs are created by user in his/her ideal time using any IM
   capable client and stored on the server (QA Holder) as well as
   client.  When user logs-in the instant messaging system the QA stored
   on the client and the server are synchronized.

      The concept of QA may not be considered solely a client-level
      feature because of the fact that all the Instant Messaging system
      today allows users to log-in the Instant Messaging system using
      different client at different point of time.  In this scenario QA
      created by one client will not be available to another client.
      So, this functionality requires a client-server model.

   To facilitate the definition of QA service, this document defines an
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) document (QA Document) and the
   application usage for managing this document using XML Configuration
   Access Protocol (XCAP).  This document can store all the QA for a
   particular user.  Any clients can create/modify/delete these QAs
   using XCAP.  This document also defines a new option tag called
   "qasupport", which if present in the supported header field of
   REGISTER request, imply that the QA synchronization procedures have
   to be initiated by Registrar.

      Extensions to presence, such as PIDF [6]were also considered but
      have a number of disadvantages: Adds more overhead as an explicit
      and periodic subscription is required; Presence fits situation
      where IM sender (as watcher) gets information about IM recipient
      (as presentity), here the situation is reverse; Will not allow
      user to choose from different option (QA) available in real-time;
      I may want to send some QA to those who are not my 'watchers'
      (because they don't care about my presence information) but very
      important to me.

   A QA is delivered to an instant messaging recipient in the same
   manner as the instant messages themselves.  This document doesn't not
   emphasize on that part considering that it can be done using existing
   mechanism.

Internet-Draft                Quick Answer                      May 2010


   The concept of QA can be considered related with the concept of
   "vacation" [3] used of emails.  However unlike QA, "vacation" does
   not allow user to choose from the list of available options (:handle
   in case of vacation).  In other words, no user intervention is
   required after vacation scripts are created.  Further unlike
   "vacation" QAs are not generated automatically.


2.  Usecase and Requirements

   For many instant messaging users, there are some messages to be
   usually used as answers.  The user can preset these messages before
   he starts an IM session, and he can quickly send these pre-configured
   messages as an answer by making fewer inputs.  The quick answer
   messages are stored in the network so that the user can set these
   messages once and use those from different devices.  User may need
   several of these quick answer messages depending on the different
   situation and need as follows:
   1.  Alice is expecting an important instant message from Bob
       containing the venue of a party scheduled for tomorrow evening.
       Since, Alice will be busy in a client meeting for the next 2
       hours, she created and store a QA , as "Thanks for the
       information, I'll be there.  What is the best way to get there"
       (Alice is new town, and not familiar with the local travel),
       using her current IM clent (her laptop at her desk).  Later,
       during the meeting Alice were log-in her IM service using her
       mobile device.  The QA created through her Laptop were made
       avaliable to her mobile device automatically.  She received an IM
       from Bob as expected.  She quickly scrolled down the list of
       avaliable QA and selected the one she created as a reply to Bob.
   2.  Alice has registered on a local social networking site and
       receives tons of instant messages everyday initiating further
       conversation.  Alice tends to reply same sort of messages
       frequently to several incoming instant messages.  To avoid
       overhead (for composing messages everytime) and to be efficient,
       Alice created some messages on her current mobile device as "Hi,
       see some more pictures at www.matchmaker.com/alice/pic","Hey!
       Thanks for the message, can I see some of your pictures",
       "Thanks, I'll get back to you", "Sorry, we don't click", etc.

   The following requirements can be derived from the above use case
   1.  The user SHALL be able to use any Instant messaging capable
       device to create and store quick answer messages
   2.  The user SHALL be able to use all stored quick answer messages
       from any Instant messaging capable device, irrespective of from
       which device they were created and stored.

   3.  It SHALL be possible to determine whether the login device has
       the same quick answer messages with the QA-Holder.  And if not,
       the QA-Holder SHALL be able to send the different quick answer
       messages to the device automatically.


3.  Terminology and Conventions

   o  QA-Holder: QA holder is a SIP user agent identified by a SIP URI.
      QA Holder stores and manages QA.
   o  Quick Answer: Quick Answer is a readily available IM to the user.
      User can create Quick Answers which are made available to the user
      to choose from.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

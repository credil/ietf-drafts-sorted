Abstract

   In instant messaging system, it is useful to have some readily
   available IM (text, audio or video) which can be sent in case of the
   receiver is too busy to type/speak/record for a reply.  These short
   IM (here after referred as QA - Quick Answer) can be created, stored
   and used when needed.  This document defines a new QA content type
   and XML namespace that conveys QA between two entities.  The QAs are
   delivered to the instant messaging sender in the same manner as the
   instant messages themselves.

Internet-Draft           Quick Answer for SIMPLE                Jan 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Instant Messaging conversation there may be some situation where
   receiver is unable to compose (type, speak) an IM in reply at that
   point of time.  However, due to the importance of the topic discussed
   and the sender himself, he also doesn't want the sender to feel
   avoided or left waiting for long time.

   To solve this issue this document proposes the concept of "Quick
   Answer" (QA), which are some readily available IM (text, audio,
   video) to the user, from which user can select as a reply to the
   sender.  QAs are created by user in his/her ideal time using any IM
   capable client and stored on the server (QA Holder) as well as
   client.  When user logs-in the instant messaging system the QA stored
   on the client and the server are synchronized.

      The concept of QA may not be considered solely a client-level
      feature because of the fact that all the Instant Messaging system
      today allows users to log-in the Instant Messaging system using
      different client at different point of time.  In this scenario QA
      created by one client will not be available to another client.
      So, this functionality requires a client-server model.

   To facilitate the definition of QA service, this document defines an
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) document (QA Document) and the
   application usage for managing this document using XML Configuration
   Access Protocol (XCAP).  This document can store all the QA for a
   particular user.  Any clients can create/modify/delete these QAs
   using XCAP.

      Extensions to presence, such as PIDF [6]were also considered but
      have a number of disadvantages: Adds more overhead as an explicit
      and periodic subscription is required; Presence fits situation
      where IM sender (as watcher) gets information about IM recipient
      (as presentity), here the situation is reverse; Will not allow
      user to choose from different option (QA) available in real-time;
      I may want to send some QA to those who are not my 'watchers'
      (because they don't care about my presence information) but very
      important to me.

   A QA is delivered to an instant messaging recipient in the same
   manner as the instant messages themselves.  This document doesn't not
   emphasize on that part considering that it can be done using existing
   mechanism.

   The concept of QA can be considered related with the concept of
   "vacation" [3] used of emails.  However unlike QA, "vacation" does
   not allow user to choose from the list of available options (:handle

   in case of vacation).  In other words, no user intervention is
   required after vacation scripts are created.  Further unlike
   "vacation" QAs are not generated automatically.


2.  Usecase and Requirements

   For many instant messaging users, there are some messages to be
   usually used as answers.  The user can preset these messages before
   he starts an IM session, and he can quickly send these pre-configured
   messages as an answer by making fewer inputs.  The quick answer
   messages are stored in the network so that the user can set these
   messages once and use those from different devices.  User may need
   several of these quick answer messages depending on the different
   situation and need as follows:
   1.  Alice is expecting an important instant message from Bob
       containing the venue of a party scheduled for tomorrow evening.
       Since, Alice will be busy in a client meeting for the next 2
       hours, she needs a message on her current mobile device as
       "Thanks for the information, I'll be there.  What is the best way
       to get there" (Alice is new town, and not familiar with the local
       travel).
   2.  Alice has registered on a local social networking site and
       receives tons of instant messages everyday initiating further
       conversation.  Alice tends to reply same initial message to
       several incoming instant message.  To avoid overhead and to be
       efficient, Alice needs some messages on her current mobile device
       as "Hi, see some more pictures at www.matchmaker.com/
       deep22gautam/pic", "Hey!  Thanks for the message, can I see some
       of your pictures", "Thanks, I'll get back to you", "Sorry, we
       don't click", etc.

   The following requirements can be derived from the above use case
   1.  The user SHALL be able to use any Instant messaging capable
       device to create and store quick answer messages
   2.  The user SHALL be able to use all stored quick answer messages
       from any Instant messaging capable device, irrespective of from
       which device they were created and stored.
   3.  It SHALL be possible to determine whether the login device has
       the same quick answer messages with the QA-Holder.  And if not,
       the QA-Holder SHALL be able to send the different quick answer
       messages to the device automatically.

   o  QA-Holder: QA holder is a SIP user agent identified by a SIP URI.
      QA Holder stores and manages QA.
   o  Quick Answer: Quick Answer is a readily available IM to the user.
      User can create Quick Answers which are made available to the user
      to choose from.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [5]


4.  Description

4.1.  Quick Answer Document

4.1.1.  Content

   Quick Answer documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded
   using UTF-8.  This specification makes use of XML namespaces for
   identifying quick answer documents and document fragments.  The
   namespace URI for elements defined by this specification is a URN,
   which is: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:im-QA.  A quick answer document has
   the <qa-set> element as the root element of the document.  This
   element has a mandatory "uri" attribute, which is used to identify
   the owner (user) of the QA document.  The content of <qa-set> element
   is a sequence of zero or more <qa> elements, each of which defines a
   single Quick Answer.  A <qa> element consists of one mandatory
   element: <msg>, containing the actual QA message.  In addition, there
   are two optional element: <id>, used to carry the unique ID, assigned
   to a particular QA by QA Holder back to the UAC; <creationdate>,
   providing the date on which the QA is created.

    </xs:complexType>

                                XML Schema

4.2.  UAC Behavior

4.2.1.  Registration

   While registering, a QA complaint UAC SHALL include a qasupport
   option tag in the supported header of the REGISTER request [1] to let
   registrar know that it supports QA and would like registrar to
   initiate the synchronization process (through QA Holder)

4.2.2.  Composing QA

   Any instant messaging user agent can create a QA.  To do so it
   creates a HTTP PUT request (as specified in [RFC4825]) aiming to add
   one or more <qa> element in the QA document.  The content-type of the
   request MUST be application/im-QA+xml.  The <qa> element MUST be
   created with <msg> and <creationdate> sub-element providing actual
   message content and current date respectively.  The <id> sub-element
   MUST NOT be included in the request.

4.2.3.  Receving HTTP 200 OK

   On receiving a HTTP 200 OK with content type application/im-QA+xml, a
   UAC SHALL store the information (<id> and corresponding <msg>)
   received as a QA.

4.2.4.  Sending QA

   After synchronization is done, the UAC will have all the QA which are
   stored on the server.  User can select one or more QA from the list
   and UAC will send it to the instant message receiver as a normal IM.

4.3.  Post-Registration Behavior

   On registration registrar will inform (only if qasupport option tag
   is present in the supported header filed of REGISTER request) QA
   Holder about the registering user agent.  To do this registrar will
   send a third-party REGISTER request to QA Holder as specified in [1]

4.4.  QA Holder Behavior

4.4.1.  Receiving third-party REGISTER from registrar

   After receiving third-party REGISTER request form registrar.  QA
   Holder SHALL initiates a session with UAC.  To do this QA Holder
   forms an INVITE request as specified in [1].  UAC receiving INVITE
   SHALL return 200 OK as the success response or the appropriate error
   response.  The session would then be established between QA Holder
   and UAC.  The QA synchronization process will them be performed on
   the session created.

4.4.2.  Receiving HTTP PUT request

   On receiving a HTTP PUT request [RFC4825] with content type
   application/ im-QA+xml, QA Holder, XCAP server, SHALL deal with that
   request as specified in [RFC4825].  QA Holder SHALL generates a
   unique ID for the QA just received and store the QA with the ID
   generated.  Further, QA Holder SHALL send the ID generated back to
   UAC.  To do so it will generate a HTTP 200 OK response with content
   type application/im-QA+xml carrying (in the body) an instance of XML
   schema defined in section 5.  The <id> element is used to carry the
   ID generated.  The <msg> element is used to carry the actual message.
   The <creationdate> element MAY be present.

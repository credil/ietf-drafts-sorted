Abstract

   Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput
   in MPLS networks are defined in RFC XXXX.  This document describes a
   profile, i.e. a simplified subset, of these procedures that suffices
   to meet the specific requirements of MPLS-based transport networks.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and
   insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published
   RFC has IETF consensus.]

1.  Introduction

   Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput
   in MPLS networks are defined in [I-D.frost-mpls-loss-delay].  This
   document describes a profile, i.e. a simplified subset, of these
   procedures that suffices to meet the specific requirements of MPLS-
   based transport networks [RFC5921] as defined in [RFC5860].  This
   profile is presented for the convenience of implementors who are
   concerned exclusively with the transport network context.

   The use of the profile specified in this document is purely optional.
   Implementors wishing to provide enhanced functionality that is within
   the scope of [I-D.frost-mpls-loss-delay] but outside the scope of
   this profile may do so, whether or not the implementation is
   restricted to the transport network context.

   The assumption of this profile is that the devices involved in a
   measurement operation are configured for measurement by a means
   external to the measurement protocols themselves, for example via a
   Network Management System (NMS) or separate configuration protocol.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.


2.  Packet Loss Measurement (LM) Profile

   When an LM session is externally configured, the values of several
   protocol parameters can be fixed in advance at the endpoints involved
   in the session, so that inspection or negotiation of these parameters
   is not required:

   o  The Query control code

   o  The byte/packet count (B) flag

   o  The extended data format (X) flag

   o  The Traffic-Class-specific (T) flag

   o  The Traffic Class (TC)

   o  The Origin Timestamp Format (OTF)

   The default values for these parameters are specified by this profile
   as follows:

   o  Query control code: In-band response requested

   o  B flag: packet count

   o  X flag: 32-bit

   o  T flag: traffic-class-scoped

   o  OTF: IEEE 1588 version 1

   The TC field is set according to the class of traffic to be measured.

   This profile is restricted to direct-mode LM and therefore uses the
   MPLS Direct Packet Loss Measurement (DLM) Channel Type in the
   Associated Channel Header (ACH).

   A simple implementation may assume externally-determined
   configuration and need only support the functionality required by
   these defaults.


3.  Packet Delay Measurement (DM) Profile

   When a DM session is externally configured, the values of several
   protocol parameters can be fixed in advance at the endpoints involved
   in the session, so that inspection or negotiation of these parameters
   is not required:

   o  The Query control code

   o  The Querier Timestamp Format (QTF) field

   o  The Responder Timestamp Format (RTF) field

   o  The Responder's Preferred Timestamp Format (RPTF) field

   o  The Traffic Class (TC)

   The default values for these parameters are specified by this profile
   as follows:

   o  Query control code: In-band response requested

   o  QTF: IEEE 1588 version 1

   o  RTF: IEEE 1588 version 1

   o  RPTF: IEEE 1588 version 1

   o  T flag: traffic-class-scoped

   The TC field is set according to the class of traffic to be measured.

   This profile uses the MPLS Delay Measurement (DM) Channel Type in the
   Associated Channel Header (ACH).

   A simple implementation may assume externally-determined
   configuration and need only support the functionality required by
   these defaults.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document delineates a subset of the procedures specified in
   [I-D.frost-mpls-loss-delay], and as such introduces no new security
   considerations in itself.  The security considerations discussed in
   [I-D.frost-mpls-loss-delay] apply also to the profile presented in
   this document.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no new IANA considerations.

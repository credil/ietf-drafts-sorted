Abstract

   This draft contains a preliminary MIB definition for a PTP Slave-
   Only Ordinary clock.  This targeted at a slave clock compliant with
   the PTP Telecom Profile described in [G.8265.1].

1. Introduction

   A companion draft to this [Fro2010] addresses the issues in managing
   packet-based synchronization systems, and highlights some areas that
   need further work and development.  This draft addresses the points
   raised in clauses 2.1 and 2.2 of [Fro2010], by defining in MIB form
   the synchronization information and performance data that a PTP
   slave device is expected to maintain.

   The PTPv2 Slave MIB module is targeted at the Slave-Only Ordinary
   Clock instance described in the ITU's PTPv2 Telecom Profile for
   Frequency Distribution [G.8265.1].  It contains the standard data
   sets defined in [IEEE1588-2008], plus some additional data relating
   to status and performance of the clock servo loop.

   The MIB contained in this version of the draft is not yet complete,
   nor is it totally syntactically correct.  However, it is an initial
   version sufficient to show the intent and direction of development.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using
   the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information
   (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the

   SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC
   2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

3. Technical Description

   The following standard data sets must be maintained in a PTPv2
   Slave-Only Ordinary Clock.  Each of these data sets is described in
   clause 8.2 of [IEEE1588-2008].

   o  Default Data Set

   o  Current Data Set

   o  Parent Data Set

   o  Time Properties Data Set

   o  Port Data Set

   These data sets provide information on the protocol aspects of a
   clock, but do not provide information on the status or performance
   of the clock servo loop.  For a slave-only ordinary clock, this
   includes the following additional data sets:

   o  Slave Status Data Set (contains current status information on the
      clock servo loop)

   o  Slave Performance Data Set (contains performance information on
      the clock servo loop)

   o  Alarm Status Data Set (contains the alarm status of the device)

   o  Network Statistics Data Set (contains performance information on
      the network itself)

   Each of these data sets is represented within the MIB using standard
   MIB syntax.

7. Conclusions

   This draft describes in MIB form the management information and
   performance data that a PTP slave device compliant with the ITU-T's
   PTP Telecom Profile [G.8265.1] is expected to maintain.

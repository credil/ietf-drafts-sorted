Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation
   functions in support of traffic engineering in multi-domain Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   networks.  In this context, the ability to compute Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in MPLS and GMPLS networks
   across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.
   This document specifies the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA)
   procedures and potential extensions for the use of Resource
   Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in PCE
   based MPLS-TE packet networks and GMPLS packet and non-packet
   networks to support a flexible establishment and maintenance of Label
   Switched Paths that cross domain boundaries or cross layers.

Internet-Draft              RSVP-TE Extension               October 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Introduction

   [RFC4726] defines the framework for inter-domain Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) (inter-area and inter-AS
   TE), and the technique for establishing an inter-domain Generalized
   MPLS (GMPLS) TE Label Switched Path (LSP) has been provided by
   [RFC5152], whereby the path is computed during the signaling process
   on a per-domain basis by the entry boundary node of each domain (each
   node responsible for triggering the computation of a section of an
   inter-domain TE LSP path is always along the path of such TE LSP).

   The employment of PCE in MPLS and GMPLS multi-domain network provides
   a great flexibility for routing and resources reserving problem.
   This document presents the potential integrated routing and singling
   procedure in PCE based MPLS and GMPLS multi-domain network and
   defines the RSVP-TE protocol extensions necessary to support the
   routing and singling approaches of end-to-end inter-domain TE LSP..

   Three different signaling methods for inter-domain RSVP-TE signaling
   are identified in [RFC4726].  Contiguous LSPs are achieved using the
   procedures of [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to create a single end-to-end
   LSP that spans all domains.  Nested LSPs are established using the
   techniques described in [RFC4206] to carry the end-to-end LSP in a
   separate tunnel across each domain.  Stitched LSPs are established
   using the procedures of [LSP-STITCHING] to construct an end-to-end
   LSP from the concatenation of separate LSPs each spanning a domain.

   For the purpose of this document, a domain is considered to be any
   collection of network elements within a common realm of address space
   or path computation responsibility.  Examples of such domains include
   Autonomous Systems, Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing areas,
   and GMPLS overlay networks.

   This document is subject to all the assumption described in RFC5152.
   Several of the new features described in this document were motivated
   by the requirements for traffic engineering over MPLS [RFC5441].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   AS: Autonomous System.

   ASBR: Autonomous System Border Router.  A router used to connect
   together ASs of a different or the same Service Provider via one or
   more inter-AS links.

   ERO: Explicit Route Object.

   LSR: Label Switching Router.

   TE link: Traffic Engineering link.

   TED: Traffic Engineering Database.

   The notion of contiguous, stitched and nested TE LSPs is defined in
   [RFC4726] and will not be repeated here.


2.  RWA Mechanisms in PCE based Multi-domain and Multi-layer Network

2.1.  Separated Path Computation Process and RSVP Process with Explicit
      End to End Route Information

   In multi-domain and multi-layer network, when the head-end router
   receives the path computation request, it would communicate with the
   PCE in its own domain.  One possible routing approach is to provide
   strict hop with ERO of the end-to-end path by cooperation between
   PCEs with different TE visibility, then start the RSVP singling
   approach defined in [RFC5151].

   In this case, it is not necessary to extend the RSVP with inter-
   domain extension (RFC5151) and the singling method depends on the
   configuration of ingress node and intermediate node or other policies
   applied.

   Furthermore, the whole resources reservation procedure for such end-
   to-end path belongs to the same RSVP Session.

               cooperation between different layer or domain

2.2.  Coordinated Path Computation Process and RSVP Process with Loose
      Route Information

   [RFC5151] defines a per-domain path computation technique for
   establishing inter-domain TE MPLS and GMPLS LSPs.  Per-domain
   computation applies where the full path of an inter-domain TE LSP
   cannot be or is not determined at the ingress node of the TE LSP, and
   is not signaled across domain boundaries.

   After receiving the end-to-end multi-domain or multi-layer path
   request from any one PCC, an alternative approach of end-to-end path
   computation is to get a loose route first from the PCE with local
   visibility (not including the ERO in remote domain), then the
   singling message which carries the loose hop information arrive the
   next domain and trigger the intra domain path computation by local
   PCE (shown in Fig.2) (dynamically computed based on the instant
   information of the network or static/fixed route).  It implies an
   extension of the RSVP singling message, e.g. including the path
   computing request information restricted/specified by the head-end
   node, as well as the message type that could be used to trigger a
   path computing request.

               cooperation between different layer or domain


3.  Detailed Extension for Border Node Procedure

   The ERO that an ASBR receives in the Path message was supplied by the
   ingress node of the TE LSP and may have been updated by other nodes
   (for example, other domain border nodes) as the Path message was
   propagated.

   Based on the Separated Path Computation Process and RSVP Process,
   which carries with Explicit End to End Route Information, it is
   unnecessary for the Border Nodes to make any additional process
   except the ERO process described in RFC5151.  Actually, the Border
   Nodes don!_t need to do any path computation related action for the
   individual resource reservation purpose, without consideration of the
   path reoptimization and failure crackback.

   If the ingress node choose coordinated path computation process and
   RSVP process, which carries with loose hops, and the ERO subobject
   identifies a TE link formed by the advertisement of an H-LSP or LSP
   segment (whether numbered or unnumbered), contiguous signaling MUST
   NOT be used.  The node MUST use either nesting or stitching according
   to the capabilities of the LSP that forms the TE link, the parameters
   signaled in the Path message, and local policy.  If there is a

Internet-Draft              RSVP-TE Extension               October 2010


   conflict between the capabilities of the LSP that forms the TE link
   indicated in the ERO and the parameters on the Path message, the
   domain border node SHOULD send a PathErr message with error code
   "Routing Problem"/"ERO conflicts with inter-domain signaling
   method",.

   What!_s more, in this case, an ERO in a Path message received by a
   domain border node may have a loose hop as the next hop.  This may be
   an IP address or an AS number.  So, the ERO MUST be expanded to
   determine the path to the next hop using some form of a path request
   or path querying message, according to the path computation process
   applied in the ingress node.

   The LSP Setup Failure processing, RRO Processing and Notify Message
   Processing are subject to the definition in [RFC5151].


4.  RSVP-TE Signaling Extensions

   The following RSVP-TE signaling extensions are defined to enable
   inter-domain LSP setup in multi-domain and multi-layer MPLS or GMPLS
   enabled network.

   In many network environments, there may be a network-wide policy that
   determines which one of the three inter-domain LSP techniques is
   used.  In these cases, no protocol extensions are required.

   However, in environments that support more than one technique, an
   ingress node may wish to constrain the choice made by domain border
   nodes for each inter-domain TE LSP that it originates.

   When the ingress node deploys the separated path computation process,
   contiguous singling scheme would not be supported, and nested or
   stitched could be chosen freely according to the configuration of
   node or domain; as the opposite, for coordinated path computation
   process, it is suitable for contiguous singling scheme.

   At the ASBR, RSVP message could trigger a path computation request or
   a routing looking up message to check the static path/route already
   stored in each PCE.  The chosen of message type depends on the
   constraints in PathReq of ingress node.  Also, there already have
   some definition in RFC5151 for the path request message, but it is
   necessary to extend for the looking up message.


5.  PCEP Extension

   when PCC submit a path computation request to PCE, the PathReq

   message should include the related RWA strategy information, one of
   which is to return an ERO of the end-to-end path and the other isn!_t
   (just loose hops).  In particular, there are two potential strategies
   to implement the loose hop option, looking up the static route
   information but without distributed among the whole network or the
   path computing dynamically after the reservation singling arrives.


6.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC4420] defines the LSP_Attributes object that can be used to
   signal required attributes of an LSP.  The Attributes Flags TLV
   includes Boolean flags that define individual attributes.

   This document defines a new bit in the TLV that can be set by the
   PCC/head-end router of an inter-domain TE LSP to define the RWA
   approach:RWA of LSP bit.

   This flag is set by the PCC/head-end router that originates a Path
   request to set up an inter-domain TE LSP if it requires that the
   coordinated path computation and RSVP process with loose hop
   information This flag bit is only to be used in the Attributes Flags
   TLV.IANA has made the code point allocations described in the
   following sections.


7.  Attribute Flags for LSP_Attributes Object

   A new bit has been allocated from the "Attributes Flags" sub-registry
   of the "RSVP TE Parameters" registry.

8.  New Error Codes

   New RSVP error codes/values have been allocated from the "Error Codes
   and Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-Codes" sub-registry of the "RSVP
   Parameters" registry.

   For the existing error code "Policy control failure" (value 2), two
   new error values have been registered as follows:103 = Inter-domain

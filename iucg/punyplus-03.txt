Internet-Draft                  punyplus                   December 2009

1.  Introduction
   
   According to the current WG-IDNABIS proposal, which is based on the
   punycode support algorithm, the entries in domain name locations
   should be subjected to a systematic preceding lowercasing without
   later restoration.  This means that uppercases are not supported on
   an end-to-end basis and that uppercased domain names are resolved as
   if they were their lowercase equivalent. Therefore, half of all the
   characters of the world's alphabets are thereby ignored by the IDNA.
   The WG-IDNABIS considers this to be perfectly acceptable. The
   WG-IDNABIS also believes that this does not significantly affect the
   overall "internationalized" domain name usage.  The resulting
   semantic loss by orthotypographic limitation makes IDNA unfit for:
   
   *  a good steganographic use of the namespace (mnemonics, encryption,
      etc.)
      
   *  a direct support of the Semantic Addressing System (SAS) that the
      IUCG is exploring.

   This memo documents a punyplus algorithm that fully supports the SAS
   and offers a strictly compliant IDNA option.
   
2.  Discussion list
   
   This proposition can be discussed on the iucg@ietf.org.
   
3.  The Interplus approach
   
   The Interplus is an Internet "better use" architecture to bring users
   better Facilitation services. It deploys additional layers on the
   user side in a manner that is transparent to the Internet layers'
   operations. It is in this way that it can support extended network
   functions (active content support) and additional services (such as
   the support of ambient content).  The Interplus architecture includes
   an ML-DNS (multi-layers domain name system) pile. This pile comprises
   three naming layers:
   
   *  User Domain Names (UDNs) that can be case sensitive full UTF-8
      
   *  Application Domain Names (ADNs) that can be case sensitive NFC
      
   *  Internet Domain Names (IDNs) that comprise alphadecimal (0-Z)
      labels (case insensitive by nature) in using strong (".")
      separators, and a weak ("-") separator between the sub-labels.

   Empty sub-labels (resulting in a "--" separation) are understood as
   the operationally validated way to support the Internet Presentation
   virtual layer, in which they separate a presentation prefix (or

   suffix) from the naming payload. "xn--" is understood as the
   "extended names presentation" prefix.
   
4.  Punyplus algorithm
   
   The punyplus algorithm is used to convert (back and forth) ADNs into
   IDNs. An option of punyplus conforms to the punycode algorithm and
   does not support uppercases.  To reliably obtain this, punyplus is a
   strict punycode copy with the added capacite (as a removable
   option)to insert the "^" prefix to signal the replacement of an
   uppercase by a lowercase. There are then two possible ways to support
   this insert.
   
4.1.  Support as a regular character
   
   When executing the punycode algorithm itself, it converts "^" as a
   non-ASCII (UMI) upper-case metadata indicator and then handles its
   code point in the regular way.  When converting back to non-ASCII, it
   restores the UMI as "^", or deletes it if the next character is
   restored as an uppercase.  Exemple:
   
      UDN: User domain name : Etat.fra
      
      ADN: Application domain name : ^etat.fra
      
      IDN: Internet domain name : xn--etat-abc.fra (abc depending on the
      choice of UMI).

4.2.  Support through a dedicated format
   
   The "^" insert is replaced by the "---1" sequence. The advantage of
   this solution is its independence from the coding system, that it is
   open to the support of other needs by sequence of "---x" or "---zz"
   type, its readability is simple and direct entries car be easily
   manually made. Its disadvantage is the user of four or five bytes to
   send a metadata.  Exemple:
   
      UDN: User domain name : Etat.fra
      
      ADN: Application domain name : ^etat.fra
      
      IDN: Internet domain name : xn--e---1tat.fra

5.  Value of the UMI codepoint
   
   There are four possibilities for the choice of the UMI code point:
   
5.1.  To use a DISALLOWED codepoint

Internet-Draft                  punyplus                   December 2009


   This will be transparent to IDNA unaware applications and uncertain
   with IDNA2003 applications, but blocked by IDNA2008 compliant
   applications. There is no risk of confusion with a lowercase
   described destination.
   
5.2.  To use an UNASSIGNED codepoint
   
   This will be transparent to IDNA unaware applications and uncertain
   with IDNA2003 applications, but blocked by IDNA2008 compliant
   applications. A conflict may result from a further edition of ISO
   10646. Otherwise, there is no risk of confusion with a lowercase
   described destination.
   
5.3.  To use a PVALID codepoint
   
   The code point would be out of regular use sequence, therefore
   signaling a special use. This will be transparent to IDNA unaware
   applications and accepted, but not necessarily understood, by
   IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 compatible applications. There is no risk of
   confusion with a lowercase described destination.
   
5.4.  To register a dedicated codepoint
   
   This will be transparent to IDNA unaware applications and uncertain
   with IDNA2003 applications, but blocked by IDNA2008 compliant
   applications. There is no risk of confusion with a lowercase
   described destination. A further IDNA update could make that code
   point PVALID and extend IDNAPLUS to all the IDNA users.
   
5.5.  Solution
   
   These possibilities will be submitted to tests and discussion with
   users.
   
6.  Naming added services
   
   The punyplus algorithm being transparent to pure ASCII UDNs/ADNs, it
   is applicable to all Internet domain names. It can therefore be used
   as an ML-DNS naming command parser and universal UDN/DNA/IDN
   converter. Its concerted generalization will therefore participate in
   an ambient canonalization of the naming space.
   
7.  Further extensions
   
   The punyplus algorithm will progressively be extended to support DNS
   related security projects, linguistic mail addresses, DNS class
   selection, semantic addressing and Netix (interplus explored
   interapplication system) commands.

8.  Multilinguistics section
   
   Multilinguistics is understood as the cybernetics of linguistic
   diversity. This memo enables improved Internet multilinguistic
   support.
   
9.  Security section
   
   The ability to use a larger number of code points that are denied; or
   an additional alphadecimal character in naming (corresponding to the
   "power" sign) that is blocked by all the naming functions, which in
   turn should not create security issues for those applications that
   are properly written or those interfaced by properly written
   applications.  The inability to use uppercases dramatically reduces
   the interest of randomly generated or encrypted domain names in
   access protection strategies.  The global stability of the Internet
   will probably be affected by some uses taking, like IDNA, a better
   advantage from its protocols. This should motivate a wide separated
   study. The author things that the punyplus practice may bring a
   positive added experience in the study and the solving of the new
   problems that may be encountered.
   
10.  IANA section
   
   The selected value of the UMI should be recorded by the IANA.

   expertise on IDNs for their dedicated support and pertinent

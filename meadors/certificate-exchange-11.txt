Abstract 
    
   The EDIINT AS1, AS2 and AS3 message formats do not currently contain 
   any neutral provisions for transporting and exchanging trading 
   partner profiles or digital certificates. EDIINT Certificate Exchange 
   Messaging provides the format and means to effectively exchange 
   certificates for use within trading partner relationships. The 
   messaging consists of two types of messages, Request and Response, 
   which allow trading partners to communicate certificates, their

1. 
   Introduction 
    
1.1 
    Overview 
    
   The growth and acceptance of EDIINT protocols, AS1, AS2 and AS3, in 
   numerous supply-chains was due in part to the security feature which 
   was provided. The security is not possible without the digital 
   certificates which enable it. To maintain the level of security 
   necessary to transmit business documentation, existing certificates 
   must occasionally be replaced and exchanged with newer ones. The 
   exchanging of digital certificates is unavoidable given how 
   certificates can expire or become compromised. Complicating this is 
   supply-chains which cannot afford to shutdown their business 
   transactions while trading partners laboriously upload new 
   certificates. Certificate exchange must be accomplished in a  
   reliable and seamless format so as not to affect ongoing business 
   transactions.  
    
   This document describes how EDIINT products may exchange public-key 
   certificates. Since EDIINT is built upon the security provided by 
   public-private key pairs, it is vital that implementers are able to 
   update their trading partners with new certificates as their old 
   certificates expire, become outdated or insecure. Certificate 
   Exchange Messaging (CEM) described here utilizes XML data to  
   exchange the certificate and provide information on its intended  
   usage and acceptance within the trading partner relationship. There

Draft                       CEM for EDIINT               September 2009 
 
 
   are two types of CEM messages. The CEM Request which presents the
   new certificate to be introduced into the trading partner relationship
   and the CEM Response which is the recipient's response to the CEM 
   Request. CE messages can be exchanged through AS1 [AS1], AS2 [AS2] or 
   AS3 [AS3] message transports. However, it is possible to leverage CE 
   messaging through other transport standards besides EDIINT. 
    
1.2 
    Terminology and Key Word Convention 
    
   [RFC4949] provides a glossary of Internet security terms, and several 
   of their definitions are listed here verbatim. However, some 
   definitions required for this document were undefined by [RFC4949] or 
   rewritten to better explain their specific use within CEM.  
    
   Certificate - A digital certificate contains the owner's (End 
   Entity's) name, the issuer's name, a serial number, expiration date, 
   and a copy of the owner's Public Key. The Public Key is used for 
   Encrypting messages and Verifying Signatures (verifying a signature 
   is also called Authentication).  
    
   Certificate Revocation List (CRL) - A data structure that enumerates 
   digital certificates that have been invalidated by their issuer prior 
   to when they were scheduled to expire. [RFC4949] 
    
   Certification Authority (CA) - An entity that issues digital 
   certificates (especially X.509 certificates) and vouches for the 
   binding between the data items in a certificate. [RFC4949] 
    
   CA Certificate - A certificate issued by a trusted certification 
   authority. CA certificates are not used to encrypt data but to sign 
   other certificates. CA certificates are signed by themselves, but are 
   not considered self-signed certificates for the purpose of this 
   document. 
    
   Certification Hierarchy - In this structure, one CA is the top CA, 
   the highest level of the hierarchy. The top CA may issue public-key 
   certificates to one or more additional CAs that form the second 
   highest level. Each of these CAs may issue certificates to more CAs 
   at the third highest level, and so on. The CAs at the second-lowest 
   of the hierarchy issue certificates only to non-CA entities, called 
   "end entities" that form the lowest level. Thus, all certification 
   paths begin at the top CA and descend through zero or more levels of 
   other CAs. All certificate users base path validations on the top 
   CA's public key. [RFC4949] 
     
   CEM Request - The EDIINT Certificate Exchange Messaging (CEM) Request 
   is one of two possible CEM messages. It presents a certificate to be 
   introduced into the trading partner relationship along with relevant 
   information on how it is to be implemented.

Draft                       CEM for EDIINT               September 2009 
 
 
    
   CEM Response - The EDIINT Certificate Exchange Messaging (CEM) 
   Response is one of two possible CEM messages. It is the response to 
   the CEM Request indicating whether or not the end entity certificate 
   present in the CEM Request was accepted.  
    
   End Entity - A system entity that is the subject of a public-key 
   certificate and that is using, or is permitted and able to use, the 
   matching private key only for a purpose or purposes other than 
   signing a digital certificate; i.e., an entity that is not a CA. 
   [RFC4949] 
    
   End Entity Certificate - A certificate which is used to encrypt data 
   or authenticate a signature. (The private key associated with the 
   certificate is used to decrypt data or sign data). The certificate 
   may be self-signed or issued by a trusted certificate. 
    
   Intermediary Certificate - A certificate issued by a CA certificate 
   which itself issues another certificate (either intermediary or end 
   entity). Intermediary certificates are not used to encrypt data but 
   to sign other certificates. 
    
   Public Key - The publicly-disclosable component of a pair of 
   cryptographic keys used for asymmetric cryptography. [RFC4949] 
    
   Public Key Certificate - A digital certificate that binds a system 
   entity's identity to a public key value, and possibly to additional 
   data items. [RFC4949] 
    
   Self-signed Certificate - A certificate which is issued by itself 
   (both issuer and subject are the same) and is an End Entity 
   certificate. 
    
1.3 
   Certificate Lifecycle 
    
   A certificate has five states. 
    
   1. Pending - Upon receiving a certificate from a trading partner, the 
      certificate is marked as Pending until a decision can be made to 
      trust it or if its validity period has not yet begun. 
   2. Rejected - If a Pending certificate is not trusted, it is 
      considered Rejected. 
   3. Accepted - Once a Pending certificate has been trusted, it is 
      considered Accepted. An Accepted certificate may be used in 
      secure transactions.  
   4. Expired - A certificate which is no longer valid because its 
      expiration date has passed. Expired certificates SHOULD be kept 
      in a certificate storehouse for decrypting and validating past 
      transactions.

Draft                       CEM for EDIINT               September 2009 
 
 
   5. Revoked - A certificate which has been explicitly revoked by its 
      owner or the certificate authority. 
    
1.4 
   Certificate Exchange Process 
    
   This section describes a process whereby a company can distribute 
   certificates to its partners, and the company and its partners can 
   put the certificates into use. Later sections describe the specific 
   CEM protocol, which is an implementation of this process.   
    
   The exchange process can be used even when CEM is not useable, for 
   example, when the transport protocols or installed software systems 
   do not support CEM. It is RECOMMENDED that this process be followed 
   in distributing certificates. 
    
    
   The company that owns the certificates initiates the process. For a 
   certificate that is to be used (by the partners) to encrypt messages, 
   the initiator first prepares his system to decrypt messages that are 
   encrypted with this certificate. The initiator must also be able to 
   decrypt messages using the old certificate. The initiator company 
   distributes the new certificates by some means. The distribution MUST 
   describe the purposes of the certificates and MAY contain a respond 
   by date, the date when the distributor expects to put the 
   certificates in use. The respond by date SHOULD be present for 
   certificates that are used to sign messages or to authenticate 
   TLS/SSL connections. 
    
   When a partner receives a certificate, the partner should 
   authenticate the distribution message by some means. (CEM provides 
   for automatic authentication.  Partners can use manual methods, 
   either with or without CEM.) 
    
   When a partner receives a certificate for use in encrypting messages 
   and has authenticated the certificate, the partner SHOULD  begin 
   using that certificate to encrypt messages. The initiator MUST be 
   prepared to receive messages encrypted with either the old or new 
   certificate. 
    
   When a partner receives a certificate for use in digitally signing 
   messages or for TLS/SSL authentication and has authenticated the 
   certificate, the partner MUST prepare his system to accept messages 
   that are signed or authenticated with the new certificate.  The 
   partner MUST also accept messages signed or authenticated with the 
   old certificate.   
    
   The partner MAY return a response to the initiator, indicating that 
   the partner has accepted the new certificate and put it in use.  The

Draft                       CEM for EDIINT               September 2009 
 
 
   initiator can use these responses to track which partners are ready 
   to use the new certificate. 
    
   When the partner has sent a response indicating acceptance of the new 
   certificate, or when the respond by date has passed, the initiator 
   can begin using the new certificate to digitally sign messages or 
   authenticate TLS/SSL messages. The initiator MUST NOT sign or 
   authenticate messages with the new certificate until the partner has 
   accepted it or until the respond by date has passed. The initiator 
   MAY wait until the respond by date or until all partners have 
   accepted.  The partners MUST accept messages signed or authenticated 
   with either the old or new certificate. 
    
   When the process is fully automated, it is not necessary to have a 
   specific time when both the initiator and partners switch to the new 
   certificate.   
    
   The initiator MUST be able to decrypt messages with both the old and 
   new certificates as soon as the new certificates are distributed.  
   The partners MUST be able to accept messages signed or TLS/SSL 
   authenticated with either the old or new certificates after they have 
   accepted the new certificate.  The initiator SHOULD allow a 
   reasonable time after distributing a new signing or authenticating 
   certificate before putting it in use, so that partners have time to 
   authenticate the new certificate and prepare their systems for it. 
    
   For a certificate used to digitally sign messages or authenticate 
   TLS/SSL messages, there must be some way for the initiator to know 
   when partners are ready to receive the certificate. For example, this 
   may be a response from the partners, an explicit respond by date in 
   the initial distribution, an implied respond by date based on partner 
   agreements, or the expiration date of the old certificate.  For a 
   certificate used to encrypt messages, the respond by date and 
   responses are less important, but responses may be useful to track 
   partners' acceptances. 
    
 
2. 
  Message Processing 
    
2.1 
   Message Structure 
    
   CEM messages use the underlying EDIINT transport, such as AS2, to 
   communicate information on the certificate, its intended use and its 
   acceptance. Both digital certificates and the XML data describing 
   their intended use are stored within a multipart/related MIME 
   envelope [RFC2387]. For the CEM Request message, the certificates are 
   stored in certificate chains through SMIME, certs-only MIME envelope 
   [3851], and processing information is XML data which is identified

   through the MIME content-type of application/ediint-cert-
   exchange+xml. The format for a CEM Request message is as follows: 
    
   Various EDIINT headers 
   Disposition-Notification-To: http://10.1.1.1:80/exchange/as2-company 
   Content-Type: multipart/signed; micalg=sha1; 
   protocol="application/pkcs7-signature";  
     boundary="--OUTER-BOUNDARY" 
    
   ----OUTER-BOUNDARY 
   Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/ediint-cert-
   exchange+xml"; boundary="--INNER-BOUNDARY" 
    
   ----INNER-BOUNDARY 
   Content-Type: application/ediint-cert-exchange+xml 
   Content-ID: <20040101-1.alpha@example.org>

   ----INNER-BOUNDARY 
   Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=certs-only

   [digital certificate] 
   ----INNER-BOUNDARY-- 
    
   ----OUTER-BOUNDARY 
   Content-Type: application/pkcs7-signature 
    
   [Digital Signature] 
   ----OUTER-BOUNDARY-- 
    
   One and only one MIME type of application/ediint-cert-exchange+xml 
   MUST be present in the multipart/related structure, and it MUST be 
   the root element. Multiple certs-only media types may be included, 
   but at least one MUST be present. A unique content-id header MUST be 
   present within each of the multipart structures. 
    
   For the CEM Response message, a multipart/related MIME structure is 
   also used. However, no certificates are present in a CEM Response, 
   and the multipart/related structure only contains one MIME type of 
   application/ediint-cert-exchange+xml. The format for a CEM Request 
   message is as follows: 
    
   Various EDIINT headers 
   Disposition-Notification-To: http://10.1.1.1:80/exchange/as2-company 
   Content-Type: multipart/signed; micalg=sha1; 
   protocol="application/pkcs7-signature";  
     boundary="--OUTER-BOUNDARY"

   If possible, both the CEM Request and CEM Response message SHOULD be 
   signed. Applying digital signatures will allow for automatic exchange 
   based on a previous trust relationship. However, it may not be 
   possible in the initial exchange of a new trading partner. If a CEM 
   message is signed, the signing certificate MUST be included in the 
   digital signature. Extra security such as applying data encryption or 
   compression is OPTIONAL. Also, CEM messages SHOULD request a MDN and 
   SHOULD request a signed MDN. The MDN can be either synchronous or 
   asynchronous. All necessary headers MUST be applied to the message 
   per the underlying transport standard.  
    
2.2 
   EDIINT Features Header 
    
   To indicate support for CEM, an EDIINT application MUST use the 
   EDIINT Features header [EDIINT-FEATURE]. The Feature Header indicates 
   the instance application can support various features, such as 
   certification exchange. The header is present in all messages from 
   the instance application, not just those which feature certification 
   exchange. 
    
   For applications implementing certification exchange, the CEM-
   Feature-Name MUST be used within the EDIINT Features header: 
    
      CEM-Feature-Name = "CEM" 
    
   An example of the EDIINT Features header in a CEM Message: 
    
      EDIINT-Features: CEM 
    
2.3 
   Certificate Exchanging

Draft                       CEM for EDIINT               September 2009 
 
 
   After obtaining the desired certificate, the initiator of the 
   certificate exchange transmits the end-entity certificate in the CEM 
   Request message. If the end-entity certificate is not self-signed, 
   then the CA certificate and any other certificates needed to create 
   the chain of trust for the end-entity certificate MUST be included in 
   the CEM Request message. Multiple end-entity certificates MAY also be 
   present. 
    
   The entire certificate trust chain is stored in a BER encoded P7C 
   format [REFERENCE LIKELY NEEDED] and placed within the SMIME certs-
   only MIME envelope which is then stored in a single part of the 
   multipart/related structure. Each P7C trust chain MUST include a 
   single end-entity certificate and its trust authorities. No other 
   certificates are to be part of this chain. The number of P7C trust 
   chains in a CEM Request message MUST be equal to the number of end-
   entity certificates being communicated in the CEM XML document. 
   If different end-entity certificates have common trust authorities' 
   certificates, each P7C cert chain still MUST include each certificate 
   necessary to create a trust anchor. Thus, if a recipient can not 
   create a trust relationship from the P7C cert chain, it MAY reject 
   the end-entity certificate in the CEM Request. 
    
   End-entity certificates are referenced and identified in the XML data 
   by their content-id used in the multipart/related structure. 
   Information on how the certificate is to be used, or certificate 
   usage, by the receiving user agent and other related information is 
   found in the XML data. A certificate can be used for a single 
   function, like digital signatures, or used for multiple functions, 
   such as both digital signatures and data encryption. If a certificate 
   is intended for multiple usages, such as for both digital signatures 
   and data encryption, the certificate MUST be listed only once in the 
   CEM Request message and its multiple usage listed through the 
   CertUsage XML element. 
    
   Upon receipt of the CEM Request, the recipient trading partner 
   processes the transport message as normal and returns the MDN. The 
   recipient MAY parse the CEM XML data prior to returning the MDN. If 
   the XML is not well-formed and can not be interpreted, the UA MAY 
   return the MDN with the error disposition modifier of "error: 
   unexpected-processing-error". The returned MDN does not provide 
   information on the acceptance of the certificate(s) being exchanged. 
   An UA who receives an MDN with an error disposition modifier MUST 
   consider the CEM Message was not understood and needs to be corrected

   Certificate Implementation

Draft                       CEM for EDIINT               September 2009 
 
 
   The new certificate is considered to be in the Pending state for the 
   recipient who MUST decide whether to accept the certificate as 
   trustworthy. This decision is arbitrary and left to each individual 
   trading partner. Upon accepting the certificate, it is to be 
   considered an Accepted certificate within the trading partner 
   relationship. If the certificate is not accepted, it is considered 
   Rejected. 
    
   When a certificate is intended for use in data encryption, the 
   initiator MUST consider the certificate to be Accepted and be 
   prepared for its trading partner to begin using the certificate upon 
   generating the CEM Request message. After a recipient generates a 
   positive CEM Response message for a certificate, the recipient MUST 
   immediately begin using the certificate in trading with the initiator 
   of the request. The recipient MAY apply encryption to the CEM 
   Response message using the new Accepted certificate or MAY apply 
   encryption to the CEM Response message using the previously Accepted 
   encryption certificate. 
    
   When a certificate is intended for use in digital signatures or 
   TLS/SSL authentication, the initiator MUST NOT use the certificate 
   until the recipient trading partner generates a CEM Response 
   accepting the certificate or the respond by date, which is listed in 
   the RespondByDate XML element. The initiator MAY use the certificate 
   after the respond by date, regardless of whether the partner has 
   accepted it or not. The certificate used for the digital signature of 
   the CEM Request message MUST be the one which is currently Accepted 
   within the trading partner relationship. 
    
   Since implementers of EDIINT often use the same certificate with 
   multiple trading partners, implementers of CEM MUST be able to keep 
   both the old and new certificates as Accepted. If the initiator has 
   generated a CEM Request and exchanged a new encryption certificate to 
   multiple trading partners, it MUST be able to accept encrypted data 
   which uses either the older, existing encryption certificate or the 
   newly exchanged encryption certificate. Likewise, a recipient of a 
   CEM Request MUST be able to authenticate digital signatures using 
   either the new or old certificates, since the initiator may not be 
   able to switch certificates until all trading partners accept the new 
   certificate. Similar provisions MUST be made for certificates 
   intended for TLS/SSL server and client authentication. Revoking a 
   certificate MUST be done outside of CEM. 
    
   If a CEM Request message contains a certificate which is currently 
   Accepted and has the identical usage for the certificate that has 
   been Accepted, the recipient MUST NOT reject the duplicate 
   certificate but MUST respond with a CEM Response message indicating 
   the certificate has been accepted. For example, if Certificate A is 
   currently Accepted as the encryption certificate for a user agent, 
 
 
Meadors, Moberg          Expires - March 2010                [Page 11] 
Draft                       CEM for EDIINT               September 2009 
 
 
   any CEM Request message containing Certificate A with the usage as 
   encryption only MUST be accepted by an existing trading partner. This 
   situation may be necessary for an implementation intending to verify 
   its current trading partner certificate. 
    
   If two trading partners utilize multiple EDIINT protocols for 
   trading, such as AS2 for a primary transport and AS1 as the backup 
   transport, it is dependent upon implementation and trading partner 
   agreement how CEM messages are sent and which transports the 
   exchanged certificates affect. 
    
2.5 
   CEM Response 
    
   The CEM Response message is a multipart/related envelope which 
   contains the CEM XML under the MIME type of application/ediint-cert-
   exchange+xml. If a requestId is used in a CEM Request, then the 
   requestId MUST be present in the CEM Response with the same value. 
   The requestId allows for the CEM Response to be matched to the CEM 
   Request. If the CEM Request contains multiple TrustRequest elements 
   and the corresponding TrustResponse elements are returned in multiple 
   CEM Response messages, each CEM Response message MUST use the same 
   requestId from the originating CEM Request message. This is critical 
   when multiple CEM Requests are sent with the same certificate and the 
   CEM Response can not be matched solely through the TrustResponse 
   elements. 
    
   A TrustResponse XML element provides information needed to match the 
   end-entity certificate sent in an earlier CEM Request and indicate if 
   the certificate was accepted or rejected by the recipient. The 
   CertificateReference in a TrustResponse matches the 
   CertificateIdentifier value for the end-entity certificate in the CEM 
   Request. CertStatus indicates if the certificate was accepted or 
   rejected. If a CEM Request is received, the recipient MUST respond 
   with a CEM Response message indicating if the certificate is Accepted 
   or Rejected. More information about the XML attributes and value for 
   CEM Response can be found in 3.2. 
    
   If the certificate in the CEM Request message contains multiple 
   usages, such as for both digital signature and data encryption, only 
   a single TrustResponse is needed for that certificate. The CertStatus 
   value in the TrustResponse is the response for both usages of the 
   certificate. A recipient MUST NOT choose to accept the certificate 
   for one specified use and not the other. 
    
   If multiple end-entity certificates were included within the CEM 
   Request, the recipient MAY generate individual CEM Response messages 
   for each certificate or the recipient MAY consolidate the 
   TrustResponse for multiple certificates into one CEM Response 
   message. A CEM Response may contain multiple TrustResponse elements

Draft                       CEM for EDIINT               September 2009 
 
 
   for different certificates but MUST NOT contain two or more 
   TrustResponses for the same certificate. 
    
   If a second TrustResponse is received in a different message matching 
   the same certificate as that of an earlier TrustRespnse but the 
   CertStatus has a different value than the other, the originator MAY 
   accept the CertStatus value in the most recent TrustResponse but MAY 
   choose to ignore it. If the CertStatus in both TrustResponses are the 
   same, the originator should disregard the second TrustResponse. 
    
   If the originator receives a CEM Response message which violates the 
   rules listed above or is invalid in any way, the originator MAY 
   reject the message entirely but MUST return an MDN if requested. 
    
    
3. 
  CEM XML Schema Description 
    
   The CEM schema has two top-level elements, 
   EDIINTCertificateExchangeRequest and 
   EDIINTCertificateExchangeResponse. The 
   EDIINTCertificateExchangeRequest element is present only in the CEM 
   Request message, and the EDIINTCertificateExchangeResponse is present 
   only in the CEM Response message. All other elements nest directly or 
   indirectly from these. CEM XML data must be well-formed and valid 
   relative to the CEM XML Schema. Please refer to the appendix for the 
   actual schema document. 
    
3.1 
   EDIINTCertificateExchangeRequest element 
    
   EDIINTCertificateExchangeRequest contains element TradingPartnerInfo, 
   which can only appear once, and TrustRequest, which may be present 
   multiple times. TrustRequest contains information on a certificate 
   and its intended usage. TradingPartnerInfo exists to provide 
   information on the publication of the CEM Request message since 
   processing of the XML data may occur apart from the handling of the 
   accompanying transport message, for example the AS2 request.

      </xs:element> 
    
   EDIINTCertificateExchangeRequest also contains the attribute 
   requestId. RequestId uniquely identifies each CEM Request message. 
   Its value MUST be between 1 and 255 characters. The requestId is 
   returned in the CEM Response message to assist the UA in matching the 
   CEM Response with the CEM Request. 
    
      <xs:simpleType name="RequestIdType"> 
         <xs:restriction base="xs:string"> 
            <xs:minLength value="1"/>

         </xs:restriction>  
      </xs:simpleType> 
    
   An optional Extension element is also present along with the 
   anyAttribute attribute. They exist to provide future extendibility 
   for new features which may be developed but not yet defined within 
   CEM. They are present in several locations in the schema for this 
   future extendibility.

         </xs:complexType> 
      </xs:element> 
    
   TradingPartnerInfo identifies the entity that created the CEM message 
   through the nested Name element. Both the qualifier attribute and the 
   element value of Name follow mandatory naming conventions. The 
   qualifier attribute is to be the transport standard utilized. For 
   example, "AS1", "AS2" or "AS3". The value of the Name element is the 
   same value in the From header utilized by the transport. For AS2 and 
   AS3, this is the value in the AS2-From and AS3-From headers, 
   respectively. For AS1, this is the value of the From header. If other 
   transports besides AS1, AS2, AS3 are used, the same naming convention 
   SHOULD be followed.  
    
   MessageOriginated is included in TradingPartnerInfo to identify the 
   time and date the message was created. The MessageOriginated date and 
   time values MUST follow XML standard dateTime type syntax and be 
   listed to at least the nearest second and expressed in local time 
   with UTC offset. For example, a message originating from the US 
   Eastern Standard timezone would use 2005-03-01T14:05:00-05:00.

   The TrustRequest element contains the EndEntity, CertUsage, 
   RespondByDate and ResponseURL elements. The required EndEntity

   CertificateIdentifier contains the string element X509IssuerName and 
   the integer element X509SerialNumber. X509SerialNumber is the 
   assigned serial number of the end entity certificate as it is listed. 
   X509IssuerName contains the issuer name information of the end-entity 
   certificate, such as common name, organization, etc. This information 
   MUST be described in a string format per the rules of RFC 4514 
   [RFC4514]. This results in the attributes within the Issuer Name to 
   be listed with their attribute type followed by an "=" and the 
   attribute value. Each attribute type and value are separated by a "," 
   and any escape characters in the value are preceded by a "\". Refer 
   to the appendix and the sample CEM Request message for an example of 
   the X509IssuerName.

   CertUsage is an unbounded element which contains enumerated values on 
   how the exchanged certificate is to be used. There are enumerated 
   values for SMIME digital signatures (digitalSignature), SMIME data 
   encryption (keyEncipherment), the server certificate used in TLS 
   transport encryption (tlsServer) and the client certificate used in 
   TLS transport encryption (tlsClient). While the element is unbounded, 
   CertUsage only has a potential number of four occurrences due to the 
   limit of the enumerated values.

   ResponseURL is an element which indicates where the CEM Response 
   message should be sent. This value takes precedence over the existing 
   inbound URL of the current trading partner relationship. The Response 
   MUST use the same transport protocol (AS1, AS2, or AS3) as the 
   Request.

   EDIINTCertificateExchangeResponse element 
    
   EDIINTCertificateExchangeResponse contains the two elements 
   TradingPartnerInfo and TrustResponse and the attribute requestId. 
   TradingPartnerInfo, which is also found in 
   EDIINTCertificateExchangeRequest, describes the trading partner 
   generating this response message. TrustResponse provides information 
   on the acceptance of a previously sent end entity certificate. There 
   can be multiple TrustResponse elements within an 
   EDIINTCertificateExchangeResponse. The requestId is the same value 
   from a previously sent CEM Request message. The requestId from the 
   CEM Response is matched up with the CEM Request.

   A TrustResponse element identifies a certificate which has been 
   previously exchanged within the trading partner relationship through 
   a CEM Request and now has been either accepted or rejected by the 
   partner. The CertificateReference element is of the same type as the 
   CertificateIdentifier element. A CertificateReference element in a 
   CEM Response MUST be identical to its CertificateIdentifier 
   counterpart in the associated CEM Request since they identify the 
   same certificate in question. 
    
   The required element CertStatus has the enumerated values of 
   "Accepted" or "Rejected". "Accepted" indicates the certificate was 
   trusted by the trading partner and is now ready for use within the 
   trading partner relationship, and "Rejected" indicates the 
   certificate is not trusted by the trading partner nor can it be 
   currently used with the trading partner relationship. If the value of 
   "Rejected" is chosen, the optional string element ReasonForRejection 
   may be included. If present, ReasonForRejection should contain a 
   brief description of why the certificate was not accepted. Since the 
   value for this element is not enumerated but open, it MUST be 
   interpreted through human means.

4. 
  Use Case Scenario 
    
   This scenario illustrates how the CEM Request and CEM Response 
   messages described in Section 2 and 3 can be used to exchange 
   certificates. The scenario is only illustrative and any differences 
   between it and the rules above should defer to the rules in Section 2 
   and 3. 
    
   Two trading partners, Alpha Arrows and Bravo Bows, have an 
   established trading partner relationship using AS2. Alpha Arrows is 
   using a single certificate, CertA, for both digital signatures and 
   data encryption. Alpha Arrows wants to issue a new certificate, 
   CertB, for digital signatures but keep CertA for data encryption.

Draft                       CEM for EDIINT               September 2009 
 
 
    
   Bravo Bows is using one certificate, Cert1, for digital signatures 
   and another certificate, Cert2, for data encryption. Bravo Bows wants 
   to introduce a new certificate, Cert3, for digital signature and a 
   new certificate, Cert4, for data encryption. 
    
   1. Alpha Arrows sends a CEM Request to Bravo Bows containing only 
   CertB. The CertUsage has a value of "digitalSignature". Bravo Bows 
   immediately returns the MDN but must make an internal security 
   decision before accepting CertB. 
    
   2. While waiting for a CEM Response, Alpha Arrows continues to send 
   AS2 messages to Bravo Bows which have been signed using CertA. The 
   messages originating from Bravo Bows are encrypted using CertA. 
    
   3. Eventually, Bravo Bows returns a CEM Response with the CertStatus 
   of "Accepted" for CertB. Upon receipt, an MDN is returned which is 
   signed using CertA. Bravo Bows MUST be able to accept the MDN if it 
   has a digital signature from either CertA or CertB as Alpha Arrows 
   may not be able to switch certificates simply upon receipt of the CEM 
   Response message without parsing the XML payload. Also, Alpha Arrows 
   may need to wait for CEM Responses from other trading partners before 
   switching to the new CertB. However, as soon as possible, Alpha 
   Arrows should use CertB exclusively for digital signatures.  
    
   4. Bravo Bows sends a CEM Request to Alpha Arrows containing both 
   Cert3 and Cert4. The CertUsage for Cert3 and Cert4 are 
   "digitalSignature" and "keyEncipherment", respectively. Alpha Arrows 
   returns an MDN immediately. Bravo Bows is now prepared to receive any 
   inbound messages encrypted by either Cert2 or Cert4, but all its 
   digital signatures are still done through Cert1. 
    
   5. Eventually, Alpha Arrows returns a single CEM Response message. It 
   contains two TrustResponse elements: one for Cert3 and another for 
   Cert4. The CertStatus for Cert3 is "Rejected" with the 
   ReasonForRejection field present and populated with the string 
   "KeyUsage value was incorrect". CertStatus for Cert4 was "Accepted." 
   Bravo Bows returns the MDN signed through Cert1. 
    
   6. Immediately after this, an AS2 message is received from Alpha 
   Arrows which is encrypted using Cert4, and Bravo Bows is able to 
   decrypt the message successfully. Because Alpha Arrows rejected 
   Cert3, Bravo Bows is only using Cert1 for digital signatures and 
   returns the MDN signed with Cert1. 
    
   7. After creating a new certificate, Cert5, which corrects the 
   previous keyUsage problem, Bravo Bows sends Cert5 in a CEM Request.

   8. Shortly after this, Alpha Arrows sends a CEM Response message for 
   Cert5. It contains a CertStatus of "Accepted". This CEM Response 
   message was encrypted using Cert4, but Bravo Bows was prepared for 
   encryption from either Cert2 or Cert4. The message is processed and a 
   good MDN is returned signed with Cert1. While, Bravo Bows can now 
   sign messages to Alpha Arrows with either Cert1 or Cert5, Bravo Bows 
   should use Cert5 exclusively as soon as possible. 
    
    
5. 
  Profile Exchange Messaging 
    
   CEM provides the means to exchange certificates among trading 
   partners. However, other profile information, such as URLs and 
   preferred security settings, is needed to create a trading partner 
   relationship. A future standard is needed to describe profile 
   descriptions and how they will be exchanged. The format for this 
   profile attachment is not defined in this specification but is 
   planned for a future document. It will build upon the existing CEM 
   protocol with profile information stored with XML data. Both 
   certificate and profile description information will be placed into a 
   multipart/related [RFC2387] body part entity. A possible format for a 
   profile description message is as follows: 
    
   Various EDIINT headers 
   EDIINT-Features: profile-exchange 
   Disposition-Notification-To: http://10.1.1.1:80/exchange/as2_company 
   Disposition-Notification-Options: signed-receipt-protocol=optional, 
     pkcs7-signature; signed-receipt-micalg=optional, sha1 
   Content-Type: multipart/signed; micalg=sha1; 
     protocol="application/pkcs7-signature"; boundary="--BOUNDARY1" 
    
   ----BOUNDARY1 
   Content-Type: multipart/related; 
     start="<aayxdfl01012000@foo.com>";  
     type="application/ediint-cert-exchange+xml";  
     boundary="--BOUNDARY2" 
    
   ----BOUNDARY2

6. 
  Implementation Considerations 
    
   This section contains various points to explain practical 
   implementation considerations. 
    
   * If the EDIINT transport message carrying a CEM Request or CEM 
   Response fails resulting in a negative MDN, the CEM message, its 
   contents and instructions are to be ignored. The User Agent receiving 
   the negative MDN is to consider the CEM message to be ignored and 
   retransmit as needed. 
    
   * While a single end-entity certificate can be only be used once in a 
   single CEM Request message, the same certificate can be sent multiple 
   times in multiple CEM Request messages. The requestId is used for 
   matching the CEM Request and CEM Response messages. 
    
   * Certificate usage is cumulative. Thus, if a User Agent receives a 
   valid CEM Request message with Certificate A with certUsage set to 
   digitalSignature and then a second valid CEM Request message with 
   Certificate A with certUsage set to keyEncipherment, then the User 
   Agent MUST configure the certificate to be used both for 
   digitalSignature and keyEncipherment. As well, if at a later time a 
   valid CEM Request message is received with Certificate A with 
   certUsage set only to digitalSignature, Certificate A is still valid 
   for keyEncipherment. 
    
    
7. 
  Future Considerations for CEM I-D 
   This section contains ideas for consideration in future versions of 
   CEM and addressed in the future. If deemed necessary, they will be 
   added into the I-D else they will be removed. This section will be 
   removed prior to RFC submission. 
    

    
8. 
  Security Considerations 
    
   Certificate exchange is safe for transmitting. However, implementers 
   SHOULD verify the received certificate to determine if it is truly 
   from the stated originator through out-of-band means or whenever the 
   request is not signed.

  IANA Considerations 
 
   MIME Media type name: Application 
    
   MIME subtype name: EDIINT-cert-exchange+xml 
    
   Required parameters: None 
    
   Optional parameters: This parameter has identical semantics to the 
     charset parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified 
     in [RFC3023]. 
    
   Encoding considerations: Identical to those of "application/xml" as 
     described in [RFC3023], section 3.2. 
    
   Security considerations: See section 6.  
    
   Interoperability Considerations: See section 2.2 
    
   Published specification: This document. 
    
   Applications which use this media type: EDIINT applications, such as 
     AS1, AS2 and AS3 implementations. 
    
   Additional Information: None 
    
   Intended Usage: Common 
    
   Author/Change controller: See Author's section of this document.

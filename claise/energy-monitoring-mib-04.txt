     1. Introduction 

        Network management is typically divided into areas of concerns 
        according to the ISO Telecommunications Management Network 
        model.  The model defines Fault, Configuration, Accounting, 
        Performance, and Security Management.  Notably missing is an 
        area of concern specifically covering energy management at an 
        equal level to these areas. 
         
        With energy becoming a more critical area of concern, this 
        document defines a subset of the Management Information Base 
        (MIB) for use with devices in and connected to communication 
        networks for energy management.  The MIB modules in this 
        document are designed to provide a model for energy management, 
        which includes monitoring for power state and energy consumption 
        of networked elements.  This MIB takes into account the 
        requirements specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  
         
        Energy management is applicable to devices that comprise and 
        that are connected to a communication network.  Target devices 
        for this specification include (but are not limited to): 
        routers, switches, Power over Ethernet (PoE) endpoints, protocol 
        gateways for building management systems, intelligent meters, 
        home energy gateway, hosts and servers, sensor proxy, etc.   
         
        Where applicable, monitoring of a device is extended to the 
        individual components of the device and/or to any attached 
        dependent device(s).  An example of such a case could be when a 
        device contains components that are independent from a power 
        state point of view (such as line cards, processor cards, hard 
        drives) or when a devices has dependent attached devices (such 
        as a switch with PoE endpoints or a power distribution unit with 
        attached endpoints).  
         
        Devices and their sub-components may be characterized by the 
        power related attributes of a physical entity present in the 
        ENTITY MIB, even though the ENTITY MIB compliance is not a 
        requirement due to the variety and broad base of devices 
        concerned with energy management. 
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires January 12, 2010           [Page 4] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>          July 2010 
      
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to 
        the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 
        58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
         
     3. Use Cases 

        The requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  The requirements in 
        [POWER-MON-REQ] cover devices that typically make up a 
        communications network such as such as switches, routers, and 
        various connected endpoints. For power monitoring to be useful, 
        a specification should also be applicable to facility meters, 
        power distribution units, gateway proxies for commercial 
        building control, home automation devices and devices that 
        interface with the utility and/or smart grid.  Due to this fact, 
        the scope of the MIB modules in this document is broader than 
        that specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  Several scenarios that cover 
        these broader use cases are presented later in Section 6 - 
        Implementation Scenarios. 
         
     4. Terminology 

        This section contains definitions of major terms used in 
        explaining the concepts, examples, and the MIB definitions. 
         
         
        Power Monitor 
         
        A Power Monitor is a system of one or more components that 
        provide power, draws power, or reports energy consumption on 
        behalf of another Power Monitor.  It can be independently 
        managed from a power monitoring and power state configuration 
        point of view.  This Power Monitor may be represented by a 
        physical component referenced using the EntPhysicalTable from 
        the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133], or by a port and group in the Power 
        over Ethernet MIB [RFC3621].  Examples of Power Monitors are: a 
        router line card, a motherboard with a CPU, an IP phone 
        connected with a switch, etc. 
         
         
        Power Monitor Parent 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires January 12, 2010           [Page 5] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>          July 2010 
      
         
        A Power Monitor Parent is a Power Monitor that is the root of 
        one or multiple subtending Power Monitors, called Power Monitor 
        Children.  The Power Monitor Parent is able to report the power 
        state and energy consumption for his Power Monitor Child(ren).   
        For example, in case of Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device such as 
        an IP phone or an access point attached to a switch port, the 
        switch is the source of power for the attached device.  In such 
        a case, the Power Monitor Parent is the port of the switch, 
        while the attached device is the Power Monitor Child.   
         
         
        Power Monitor Child 
          
        A Power Monitor Child is a Power Monitor associated to a Power 
        Monitor Parent, which draws power from its Power Monitor Parent 
        or reports its power usage and power state to its Power Monitor 
        Parent. 
         
         
        Power Monitor Meter Domain 
         
        A Power Monitor Meter Domain is a name or name space that 
        logically groups together Power Monitors that comprises a zone 
        of manageable power usage.  Typically, this will comprise all 
        Power Monitors that are powered from the same electrical panel 
        or panels for which there is a meter or sub meter.  For example, 
        all Power Monitors receiving power from the same distribution 
        panel of a building, or all Power Monitors in a building for 
        which there is one main meter.  From the point of monitoring 
        power use, it is useful to report the total power usage as the 
        sum of power consumed by all the Power Monitors within a Power 
        Monitor Meter Domain and then correlate that value to the 
        metered usage.  
         
         
        Power Level 
         
        A uniform way to classify power settings on a Power Monitor 
        (e.g., shut, hibernate, sleep, high).  Power Levels can be 
        viewed as an interface for interacting with the underlying 
        device implemented power settings.  
         
         
        User Defined Power Level 
         
        A device specific way to classify power settings implemented on 
        a Power Monitor.  For cases where the implemented power setting 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires January 12, 2010           [Page 6] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>          July 2010 
      
        cannot be directly mapped to a Power Level(s), the User Defined 
        Power Levels are used to enumerate and show the relationship 
        between the implemented power settings and the Power Level 
        interface. 
      
           
     5. Concepts 

        This section will go over the basic concepts of the Power 
        Monitor MIB.  The basic concepts are summarized and then each is 
        listed with notable descriptions that give background before 
        reading the actual MIB definitions.  
         
        Examples will be provided in a later section to show how these 
        concepts can be fulfilled in an implementation.  
        

       5.1 Summary 

        Given a Power Monitor, we can describe the information about the 
        Power Monitor through various data.  A Power Monitor will have 
        basic naming and informational descriptors to identify it in the 
        network. 
         
        A Power Monitor can be part of a Power Monitor Meter Domain.  A 
        Power Monitor Meter Domain is a manageable set of devices that 
        has a meter or sub-meter attached and typically corresponds to a 
        power distribution point or panel.  
         
        A Power Monitor can be a parent (Power Monitor Parent) or child 
        (Power Monitor Child) of another Power Monitor.  This allows for 
        devices to aggregate reporting and/or control of power 
        information. 
         
        Each Power Monitor can have information to allow it to be 
        described in the context of the business or ultimate use.  This 
        is in addition to its networked information.  This allows for 
        tagging, grouping and differentiation between Power Monitors for 
        NMS. 
         
        For control and universal monitoring each Power Monitor will 
        implement or declare a set of known Power Levels.  The Power 
        Levels can be mapped to User Defined Power Levels that indicate 
        the specific power setting for the device implementing the Power 
        Monitor.  
         


      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires January 12, 2010           [Page 7] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>          July 2010 
      
        Each Power Monitor will have usage information that describes 
        the instantaneous power information along with how that usage 
        was obtained or derived. 
         
        Optionally a Power Monitor can further describe the 
        instantaneous power information with power quality information 
        reflecting the electrical characteristics of the measurement. 
         
        Optionally a Power Monitor can provide power usage over time to 
        describe energy consumption 
         
        If a Power Monitor has one or more batteries, it can provide 
        optional Battery information as well. 
         
         
       5.2 Power Monitor Information    

        Every Power Monitor should have a printable name pmName, and a 
        unique Power Monitor index pmIndex.  
      
        pmIndex is an unique index greater than zero for each Power 
        Monitor.  It is recommended that values be assigned sequentially 
        starting from 1.  The value for each pmIndex must remain 
        constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's 
        network management system to the next re-initialization.  In 
        addition, that Power Monitor can potentially have an 
        entityPhysicalIndex from the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133] in the 
        pmPhysicalEntity, if supported by the Power Monitor.  In case of 
        Power over Ethernet (if the Power over Ethernet MIB is supported 
        on the Power Monitor), the Power Monitor pmethPortIndex and 
        pmethPortGrpIndex must contain the values of pethPsePortIndex 
        and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively.  In case of LLDP-MED 
        (if the LLDP-MED MIB is supported on the Power Monitor), the 
        Power Monitor pmLldpPortNumber must contain the lldpLocPortNum 
        from the LLDP MIB.    
         
        Possible pmName conventions are: textual DNS name, MAC-address 
        of the device, interface ifName, or a text string uniquely 
        identifying the Power Monitor.  However, if entPhysicalName is 
        present for the respective pmPhysicalEntity (i.e. if the ENTITY-
        MIB is supported), then the pmName SHOULD be identical to the 
        entPhysicalName.  The pmName SHOULD be unique.  As an example, 
        in the case of IP phones, pmName can be the device DNS name, 
        while in the case of router/switch line cards, the pmName should 
        contain the entPhysicalName.   
      


      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires January 12, 2010           [Page 8] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>          July 2010 
      
        To distinguish if a Power Monitor is producing, consuming or 
        metering power, the pmPowerCategory MIB object must be 
        implemented.  
         
         
       5.3 Power Monitor Meter Domain 

        Each Power Monitor can be a member of a Power Monitor Meter 
        Domain.  The Power Monitor Meter Domain could map 1-1 with a 
        metered or sub-metered portion of the site.  It can be used to 
        further sub divide the deployment down to finer Power Monitor 
        Meter Domains such as a floor, lab, data center, rack, etc.  
        With the possible evolution of this draft to a framework 
        document the notion of Power Monitor Meter Domain will be useful 
        to provide a name space for power distribution points. 
         
        The Power Monitor Meter Domain MUST be configured on the Power 
        Monitor Parent.  The Power Monitor Children may inherit its 
        domain value from the Power Monitor Parent.  Note that the 
        specification of how to communicate this information between the 
        Power Monitor Parent and Children is out of the scope of this 
        document.  One point of the parent/child design is that 
        typically the network is fixed and the endpoints are transient.  
        In some cases, Power Monitor Children may have a static non-
        transient configuration.  In such cases, the Power Monitor Meter 
        Domain MAY be configured directly in Power Monitor Child. 
         
         
       5.4 Power Monitor Parent and Child 

        A Power Monitor can be connected to another Power Monitor and 
        either draw power from that entity or report power usage to that 
        entity. 
         
        The use of a Power Monitor Parent is not limited to just PoE 
        children.  A Power Monitor Child can be fully dependent on the 
        Power Monitor Parent or independent from the parent.  In the 
        dependent case, the Power Monitor Parent provides power for the 
        Power Monitor Child (the PoE case).  In the independent case, 
        the Power Monitor Child draws power from another source 
        (typically a wall outlet).  Since the switch is not the source 
        of power supply, the power usage cannot be measured at the Power 
        Monitor Parent.   However, an independent Power Monitor Child 
        may report Power Monitor information to the Power Monitor 
        Parent.  The Power Monitor Child may listen to the power control 
        settings from a Power Monitor Parent and could react to the 
        control messages.  Note that the communication between the Power

        Monitor Parent and Power Monitor Child is out of scope of this 
        document. 
         
        In order to link the Power Monitor Child and the Power Monitor 
        Parent the pmParentId is introduced.   
         
        Further examples of Power Monitor Parent and Child 
        implementations are provided in the Implementation Scenarios 
        section. 
         
         
       5.5 Power Monitor Context 

        Monitored power will ultimately be collected to and reported 
        from a NMS.  In order to aid in the reporting and 
        differentiation between Power Monitors, each Power Monitor will 
        contain information to establish a business or site context.  
        A Power Monitor can provide a pmImportance value in the range of 
        1..100 to help differentiate the use or relative value to the 
        site. 
         
        A Power Monitor can provide a set of pmKeywords.  These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Power Monitor Meter Domains. 
         
        Additionally, a Power Monitor can provide a pmRoleDescription 
        string that indicates the purpose the Power Monitor serves in 
        the network or to site/business. 
      
         
       5.6 Power Monitor Levels 

        Power Levels represent universal states of power management of a 
        Power Monitor.  The higher the Power Level, the higher the power 
        consumed.  Each Power Level corresponds to a global, system, and 
        performance state in the ACPI model.  
         
         
                Level        ACPI Global/System      Name 
                                    State 
         
        Non-operational states:

        Operational states: 
                  7               G0, S0, P5       LowMinus 
                  8               G0, S0, P4       Low 
                  9               G0, S0, P3       MediumMinus 
                 10               G0, S0, P2       Medium 
                 11               G0, S0, P1       HighMinus 
                 12               G0, S0, P0       High   
         
        For example, a Power Monitor with a Power Level of 9 would 
        indicate an operational state with MediumMinus Power Level. 
         
        The Power Levels can be considered as guidelines for an 
        interface in order to promote interoperability across device 
        types.  Realistically, it is foreseen that each specific feature 
        requiring Power Levels will require a complete recommendation of 
        its own.  For example, designing IP phones with consistent Power 
        Levels across vendors requires a specification for IP phone 
        design, along with the Power Levels mapping. 
         
        In some situations, the Power Monitor Child cannot immediately 
        be set to a specific Power Level, even if supports this specific 
        Power Level.  For example, a phone must wait until the call is 
        finished to reduce his Power Level.  For example, a PC must 
        finish his backup before going into a hibernate state.  Another 
        reason why the Power Monitor Child cannot immediately be set to 
        a specific Power Level is that the MIB module is supported on 
        the Power Monitor Parent while the configuration refers to a 
        remote Power Monitor Child.  
         
        Therefore, there are actually two MIB variables related to the 
        Power Levels: one for the requested Power Level (pmPowerLevel) 
        and the other one for the actual Power Level 
        (pmPowerActualLevel).  pmPowerLevel is read-write, while 
        pmPowerActualLevel is read-only.  In order to change the Power 
        Level, the NMS sets the pmPowerLevel to the new value.  At this 
        point in time, the Power Monitor Child MUST transition to the 
        Power Level as soon as possible.  Once done, the 
        pmPowerActualLevel is changed to the new Power Level. 
         
        When polling from the NMS, a difference in values between the 
        pmPowerLevel and pmPowerActualLevel implies that this specific 
        Power Monitor Child is currently in transition.  
         
        In some situation, User Defined Power Levels are required, for 
        example, when no mappings with the existing Power Levels are 
        possible or when more levels than the twelve specified Power 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires January 12, 2010          [Page 11] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>          July 2010 
      
        Levels are required.  In such cases, this MIB module, via the 
        pmUserDefinedPowerLevel MIB variable, gives the possibility to 
        specify those User Defined Power Levels.  Like for the Power 
        Level, the higher the User Defined Power Level, the higher the 
        power consumed.  Finally, the User Defined Power Level name can 
        be set with the pmUserDefinedPowerLevelName MIB variable. 
         
        A first example would be an imaginary device type, with only 
        five levels: "none", "short", "tall", "grande", and "venti".  
         
          User Defined Power Level     Respective Name 
               0                         none 
               1                         short 
               2                         tall 
               3                         grande 
               4                         venti 
         
        In the unlikely event of no possible mapping between these User 
        Defined Power Levels and the Power Levels, the pmPowerLevel will 
        remain 0 throughout the MIB module, as displayed below.   
         
           Power Level / Name       User Defined Power Level / Name 
               0 / unknown              0 / none 
               0 / unknown              1 / short 
               0 / unknown              2 / tall 
               0 / unknown              3 / grande 
               0 / unknown              4 / venti 
                      
        If a mapping between the User Defined Power Levels and the Power 
        Levels is achievable, both series of levels exist in the MIB 
        module, allowing the NMS to understand the mapping between them 
        by correlating the pmPowerLevel with the 
        (pmUserDefinedPowerLevel, pmUserDefinedPowerLevelName).

        How the Power Monitor Levels are then mapped, i.e. assigning the 
        directly lower or directly higher level, is an implementation 
        choice.  However, its recommended that the User Defined Power 
        Level maps to the directly lower Power Level, so that setting 
        all Power Meters to a Power Level would be conservative in terms 
        of disabled functionality on the Power Monitor implementing the 
        User Defined Power Levels. 
         
        A second example would be a device type, such as a dimmer or a 
        motor, with a high number of operational levels.  For the sake 
        of the example, 100 operational states are assumed.

        both the Power Level and User Defined Power Level are used in 
        the Power Monitor (non 0 values), then it might be advantageous 
        to populate all Power Level entries.  This would allow an NMS to 
        set all Power Monitors to a certain Power Level, regardless of 
        the mapping to a User Define Power Level or not.   
      

       5.7 Power Monitor Usage Measurement 

        For a Power Monitor, instantaneous power usage is reported using 
        pmPower.  The magnitude of measurement is based on the 
        pmPowerUnitMultiplier MIB variable, based on the UnitMultiplier 
        Textual Convention (TC).  
                    
        pmPowerUnitMultiplier is a scaling factor used to represent the 
        magnitude of Power Monitor usage.  It conforms to the IEC 61850 
        definition of unit multiplier for the SI (System International) 
        units of measure.  Measured values are represented in SI units 
        obtained by BaseValue * 10 raised to the power of Scale.  For 
        example, if current power usage of a Power Monitor is 3, it 
        could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, 3 MW depending on the value of 
        pmPowerUnitMultiplier.  Note that other measurements throughout 
        the two MIB modules in this document use the same mechanism, 
        including pmPowerLevelPowerUnitMultiplier, 
        pmDemandIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and 
        pmACPwrQualityPowerUnitMultiplier. 
                                         
        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude it is useful to 
        know how a pmPower measurement was obtained.  An NMS can use 
        this to account for the accuracy and nature of the reading 
        between different implementations.  For this pmPowerOrigin 
        describes whether the measurements were made at the device 
        itself or from a remote source.  The pmPowerCaliber describes 
        the method that was used to measure the power and can 
        distinguish actual or estimated values.  
         
        In addition to the instantaneous usage the nameplate power 
        rating of a Power Monitor is typically specified by the vendor 
        as the capacity required to power the device.  Often this label 
        is a conservative number and is the worst-case power draw.  
        While the actual utilization of an entity can be lower, 
        pmPowerNameplate is important for provisioning, capacity 
        planning and billing.   
         
        [POWER-MON-REQ] specifies some requirements about power states 
        such as "the current state - the time of the last change", "the 
        total time spent in each state", "the number of transitions to 
        each state", etc...  Such requirements are fulfilled via the

        pmPowerLevelChange NOTIFICATION-TYPE, indexed by pmPowerLevel 
        and pmUserDefinedPowerLevel.  This SNMP notification is 
        generated when the value(s) of pmPowerLevel and/or 
        pmUserDefinedPowerLevel has/have changed for the Power Monitor 
        represented by the pmIndex.   
         
         
       5.8 Optional Power Usage Quality 

        Given an instantaneous power measurement of a Power Monitor, it 
        may in certain circumstances be desirable to know the power 
        quality associated with that measurement.  An optional 
        powerQualityMIB MIB module can be implemented to further 
        describe the measurement.  The powerQualityMIB MIB module 
        adheres closely to the IEC 61850 7-2 standard to describe AC 
        measurements.  In some Power Monitor Domains, the power quality 
        may not be needed, available, nor relevant to the Power Monitor.  
        In those cases, the powerQualityMIB need not be provided.  
         
        The powerQualityMIB MIB module contains a primary table, the 
        pmACPwrQualityTable table, that defines power quality 
        measurements for supported pmIndex entities, as a sparse 
        extension of the pmTable (so with pmIndex as primary index).  
        This pmACPwrQualityTable table contains information such as the 
        configuration (single phase, DEL 3 phases, WYE 3 phases), the 
        voltage, frequency, power accuracy, total active/reactive 
        power/apparent power, the amphere, and the voltage.  
         
        In case of 3-phase power, the pmACPwrQualityPhaseTable 
        additional table is populated with power quality measurements 
        per phase (so double indexed by the pmIndex and pmPhaseIndex).  
        This table, which describes attributes common to both WYE and 
        DEL configurations, contains the average current, 
        active/reactive/apparent power, power factor and the impedance. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a DEL configuration, the 
        pmACPwrQualityDelPhaseTable table describes the phase-to-phase 
        power quality measurements, i.e., voltage and current. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a Wye configuration, the 
        pmACPwrQualityWyePhaseTable table describes the phase to neutral

        In addition to reporting the Power Level, an approach to 
        characterize the energy demand is also presented in the MIB

        module.  It is well known in commercial electrical utility 
        rates, that demand charges can be on par with actual power 
        charges.  So, it is useful to characterize the demand.  The 
        demand can be described as the average energy of an Power 
        Monitor over a time window, called a demand interval, typically 
        15 minutes.  The highest peak energy demand measured over a time 
        horizon, say 1 month or 1 year is often the basis for usage 
        charges.  A single window of time of high usage can penalize the 
        energy consumption charges.  However, it is relevant to measure 
        the demand only when there are actual power measurements from a 
        Power Monitor, and not when the power measurement is assumed or 
        predicted as specified in the description clause of the object 
        PowerMeasurementCaliber.    
         
        Two tables are introduced to characterize the energy demand - 
        pmDemandEnergyTable and pmDemandEnergyParametersTable.  The 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersTable table consists of parameters 
        defining: the duration of the demand intervals in seconds, 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength; the number of demand 
        intervals kept in the pmDemandEnergyTable, 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber; the type of demand 
        intervals, pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalMode, and a same rate 
        used to calculate the average, 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate.  Judicious choice of the 
        SamplingRate will ensure accurate measurement of power while not 
        imposing an excessive polling burden.  If the interval mode is 
        'sliding', pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalWindow specifies the 
        interval between windows.  The pmDemandEnergyParametersStatus is 
        useful to specify the energy measurement is actual and thus to 
        indicate if the pmDemandEnergyTable entries exist or not. 
         
        The pmDemand Table consists of energy measurements in 
        pmDemandIntervalEnergyUsed, the scale of energy measured, 
        pmDemandIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and the maximum observed 
        demand in a window - pmDemandIntervalMax. 
         
        Several efficiency metrics can be derived and tracked with the 
        usage data present in this MIB module.   
         
          . For example, per-packet power costs for a networking device 
             (router or switch) can be calculated by an network 
             management system.  The packets count can be determined 
             from the traffic usage in the ifTable [RFC2863] from the 
             forwarding plane figure, or from the platform 
             specifications.

          . Watt-hour power use from this MIB can be combined with 
             utility energy sources to estimate carbon footprint and 
             other emission statistics. 
         
        The pmDemandEnergyTable and pmDemandEnergyParametersTable will 
        be illustrated with the following example.  First, in order to 
        estimate demand, an interval to sample energy should be 
        specified, i.e.  pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength can be 
        "900 seconds" and the number of consecutive intervals over which 
        the maximum demand is calculated 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber as "10".  The sampling 
        rate internal to the Power Monitor for measurement of power 
        usage, pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate, can be "1000 
        milliseconds", as set by the Power Monitor as a reasonable 
        value.  Then, the pmDemandEnergyParametersStatus is set to 
        active (value 1) to indicate that the Power Monitor should start 
        monitor the usage as per the pmDemandEnergyTable. 
         
        The indices in the pmDemandEnergyTable are pmIndex, which 
        identifies the Power Monitor, and pmDemandIntervalStartTime, 
        which denotes the start time of the demand measurement interval 
        based on sysUpTime.  The value of pmDemandIntervalEnergyUsed is 
        the measured energy consumption over the time interval specified 
        (pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength) based on the Power 
        Monitor internal sampling rate 
        (pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate).   The units are derived 
        from pmDemandIntervalPowerUnitMultiplier.  For example, 
        pmDemandIntervalPowerUsed can be "100" with 
        pmDemandIntervalPowerUnits equal to 0, the demand is 100 watt-
        hours.  pmDemandIntervalMax is the maximum demand observed can 
        be "150 watt-hours".   
         
        The pmDemandEnergyTable has a buffer to retain a certain number 
        of intervals, as defined by 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber.  If the default value of 
        "10" is kept, then the pmDemandEnergyTable contains 10 demand 
        measurements, including the maximum.  A brief explanation on how 
        the maximum demand can be calculated is presented.  The first 
        observed demand measurement value is taken to be the initial 
        maximum.  With each subsequent measurement, based on numerical 
        comparison, maximum demand may be updated.  The maximum value is 
        retained as long as the measurements are taking place.  Based on 
        periodic polling of this table, a NMS could compute the maximum 
        over a longer period, i.e. a month, 3 months, or a year.

       5.10 Optional Battery Information 

        EDITOR NOTE: since a merge between this draft and [QUITTEK-
        POWER-MIB] seems to be the direction that the OPSAWG IETF WG 
        wants to go, one idea is to copy the battery MIB module from 
        [QUITTEK-POWER-MIB].   
         

     6. Implementation Scenarios 

         
        The scope of power and energy monitoring consists of devices 
        that consume power within and connected to a communications 
        network.  These devices include: 
         
        - Network devices and sub-components: devices such as routers 
        and switches and their sub-components. 
         
        - Network attached endpoints: devices that use the 
        communications network such as endpoints, PCs, or facility 
        gateways that proxy energy monitor and control for commercial 
        buildings or home automation,  
         
        - Network attached meters or supplies: devices that can monitor 
        the electrical supply such as smart meters or Universal Power 
        Supplies (UPS) that meter and provide availability.  
        This section provides illustrative examples that model different 
        scenarios for implementation of the Power Monitor including 
        Power Monitor Parent and Power Monitor Child relationships. 
         

     Scenario 1: Switch with PoE endpoints  

        Consider a PoE IP phone connected to a switch, as displayed on 
        figure 1.  The IP phone draws power from the PoE switch.  The 
        switch has the following attributes, also illustrated in Figure 
        1: pmIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity "2", and pmPowerMonitorId "UUID 
        1000".  The power usage of the switch is "440 Watts".  The 
        switch does not have a Power Monitor Parent. 
         
        The PoE switch port has the following attributes - The switch 
        port has pmIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power usage of the POE 
        switch port is "12 watts".  The POE switch port has the switch 
        as the Power Monitor Parent, with its pmParentID of "1000". 
         
        The IP phone has the following attributes: the IP phone has 
        pmIndex "31" and pmPowerMonitorId "UUID 2003", but doesn't have

        an entry for pmPhysicalEntity, as the ENTITY MIB is not 
        supported on this device.  The IP phone has a Power Monitor 
        Parent; the POE switch port whose pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 
        1003".  The power usage of the IP phone is measured at the POE 
        switch port and the pmUsage on the PoE IP phone reports 0.

        device(s)  

        Consider the same scenario as example 1 with an IP phone 
        connected to PoE port of a switch.  Now, in addition, a PC is 
        also daisy-chained from the IP phone for LAN connectivity.  The

        phone draws power from PoE port of the switch, while the PC 
        draws power from the wall outlet.  
         
        The attributes of the switch, switch port and IP phone are the 
        same as in Scenario 1.  The attributes of the PC are given 
        below.  The PC does not have pmPhysicalEntity.  The pmIndex of 
        the PC "57", the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 3003".  The PC has a 
        Power Monitor Parent, i.e. the switch port whose 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power usage of the PC is 
        "120 Watts" and is communicated to the switch port.  
         
        This example is used to illustrate the distinction between the 
        Power Monitor Children: the IP phone draws power from the 
        switch, while the PC has LAN connectivity from the phone, but is 
        powered from the wall outlet.  However, the Power Monitor Parent 
        sends power control messages to both the Power Monitor children 
        (IP phone and PC) and the children react upon those messages.

     Scenario 3: A switch with Wireless Access Points 

        Consider a Wireless Access Point connected to the PoE port of a 
        switch.  There are several PCs connected to the Wireless Access 
        Point over Wireless protocols.  All PCs draw power from the wall 
        outlets.  
         
        The switch port is the Power Monitor Parent for the Wireless 
        Access Point (WAP) and the PCs.  There is a distinction, between 
        the Power Monitor Children, as the WAP draws power from the PoE 
        port of the switch and the PCs draw power from the wall outlet.  
         
        The switch has pmIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity is "2" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000".  The power usage of the switch 
        is "440 Watts".  The switch does not have a Power Monitor 
        Parent. 
         
        The PoE switch port has the following attributes - The switch 
        port has pmIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power usage of the POE 
        switch port is "20 watts".  The POE switch port has the switch 
        as the parent and the pmParentID is "UUID 1000".  
         
        The WAP has the following attributes.  The WAP doesn't have an 
        entry for pmPhysicalEntity.  The WAP has pmIndex "47" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId "UUID 2004" and WAP has a parent; the POE 
        switch port whose pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power 
        usage of the WAP is measured at the PoE switch port.  
         
        The PC1 and PC2 does not have pmPhysicalEntity.  The pmIndex of 
        the PC "53", the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 3".  The PC has a

     Scenario 4: Network connected facilities gateway 

        At the top of the network hierarchy of a building network is a 
        gateway device that can perform protocol conversion between many 
        facility management devices, such as BACNET, MODBUS, DALI, LON,  
        etc.  There are power meters associated with power consuming 
        entities (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning - HVAC, 
        lighting, electrical, fire control, elevators, etc).  The 
        proposed MIB can be implemented on the gateway device.  The 
        gateway can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent, while the 
        power meters associated with the energy consuming entities such 
        can be considered as Power Monitor Children.  EntPhysicalIndex 
        is not defined for these Power Monitor Parent or the Children, 
        as the ENTITY MIB is generally not implemented in such an 
        environment.  Hence the gateway, meter 1, and meter 2 have 
        pmPhysicalEntities of value zero.  The pmIndex of the gateway is 
        "5", and the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1004".  The gateway does 
        not have a Power Monitor Parent; The total power usage of the 
        gateway and its children is "9000 Watts".  
         
        Meter 1 has pmIndex "100", and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 2005". 
        Meter 1 shall report a power usage of "6000 watts".  Meter 1 has 
        the gateway as the parent and its pmParentID is "UUID 1004".  
         
        Meter 2 has pmIndex "101", and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 3005". 
        Meter 2 shall report a power usage of "1500 watts".  Meter 2 has 
        the gateway as the Power Monitor Parent and its pmParentID is 
        "UUID 1004".

     Scenario 5: Data Center Network 

        A typical data center network consists of a hierarchy of 
        switches.  At the bottom of hierarchy there are servers mounted 
        on a rack, and those are connected to the top of the rack 
        switches.  The top switches are connected to aggregation 
        switches that are in turn connected to core switches.  As an 
        example, Server 1 and Server 2 are connected to different switch 
        ports of the top switch.

        The proposed MIB can be implemented on the switches.  The switch 
        can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent.  The servers can 
        be considered as the Power Monitor Children.  
         
        The switch has pmIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity is "2", and the 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000".  The power usage of the switch 
        is "440 Watts". The switch does not have a parent. 
         
        Firstly, the switch ports are non-PoE and have the following 
        attributes - Server 1 is connected to Switch port 1.  Switch 
        port 1 has pmIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  Switch port 2 has pmIndex "4", 
        pmPhysicalEntity is "13" and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1004".  
        The power usage of the non-POE switch port cannot be measured.  
        The switch ports have the switch as the Power Monitor Parent and 
        its pmParentID is "1000".  
         
         
        The Server 1 has a value of zero for pmPhysicalEntity.  The 
        pmIndex of the Server 1 is "5", and the pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "UUID 2006".  Server 1 has a Power Monitor Parent; i.e., the 
        switch port whose pmPowerMonitorId is "1003".  The power usage 
        of the Server 1 is "200 Watts" and is communicated to the switch 
        port.  
         
         
        The Server 2 has a value of zero for pmPhysicalEntity.  The 
        pmIndex of the Server 2 is "6", and the pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "UUID 3006".  Server 1 has a parent; i.e., the switch port whose 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "1054".  The power usage of the Server 2 is 
        "140 Watts" and is communicated to the switch port.  
         
        Communication of power usage of Server1 and Server2 to the 
        switch is out of scope of this document.

     Scenario 7: Power Consumption of Battery-based Devices 

        As specified in [POWER-MON-REQ], battery state monitoring is a 
        requirement for the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB.  
        EDITOR NOTE: since a merge between this draft and [QUITTEK-
        POWER-MIB] seems to be the direction that the OPSAWG IETF WG 
        wants to go, one idea is to copy the battery MIB module from 
        [QUITTEK-POWER-MIB].   
         
         
     7. Link with the other IETF MIBs 

                     
     7.1. Link with the ENTITY MIB and the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB  

        RFC 4133 [RFC4133] defines the ENTITY MIB module that lists the 
        physical entities of a networking device (router, switch, 
        etc...) and those physical entities listed indexed by 
        entPhysicalIndex.  From an energy management point of view, the 
        physical entities that consume or produce energy are of 
        interest. 
         
        RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB module that 
        provides a standardized way of obtaining information (current 
        value of the sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the 
        data units precision) from sensors embedded in networking 
        devices.  Sensors are associated with each index of 
        entPhysicalIndex of the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133].  While the focus 
        of the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB, is on measurement of 
        power usage of networking equipment indexed by the ENTITY MIB, 
        this MIB proposes a customized power scale for power measurement 
        and different power level states of networking equipment and a 
        functionality to configure the power level states. 
         
        When this MIB module is used to monitor the power usage of 
        devices such as routers and switches, the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-
        SENSOR MIB SHOULD be implemented.  In such cases, the Power 
        Monitors are modeled by the entPhysicalIndex through the 
        pmPhysicalEntity MIB object specified in the pmTable.   

        However, the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433] doesn't have the ANSI 
        C12.x accuracy classes required for electricity, i.e., 1%, 2%, 
        0.5% accuracy classes: indeed, the entPhySensorPrecision 
        [RFC3433] represents "The number of decimal places of precision 
        in fixed-point sensor values returned by the associated 
        entPhySensorValue object".  The ANSI and IEC Standards are used 
        for power measurement and these standards require that we use an 
        accuracy class, and not the scientific number precision model as

     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>          July 2010 
      
        specified in RFC3433.  The pmPowerAccuracy MIB object models 
        this accuracy.  Note that the pmPowerUnitMultipler represents 
        the scale factor per IEC 61850, which is a more logical 
        representation for power measurements (compared to 
        entPhySensorScale), with the mantissa and the exponent values X 
        * 10 ^ Y. 

        Power measurements specifying the qualifier 'UNITS' for each 
        measured value in watts are used by the LLDP-EXT-MED-MIB, POE 
        [RFC3621], and UPS [RFC1628] MIBs.  The same 'UNITS' qualifier 
        is used for the power measurement values.    
         
        One cannot assume that the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-SENSOR MIB are 
        implemented for all Power Monitor that needs to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol such as BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the pmPhysicalEntity value 
        contains the zero value, thanks to PhysicalIndexOrZero textual 
        convention. 
        The pmIndex MIB object has been kept as the unique Power Monitor 
        index.   The pmPower is similar to entPhySensorValue [RFC3433] 
        and the pmPowerUnitMultipler is similar to entPhySensorScale. 
      
         
     7.2. Link with the ENTITY-STATE MIB  

        For each entity in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133], the ENTITY-STATE 
        MIB [RFC4268] specifies the operational states (entStateOper: 
        unknown, enabled, disabled, testing), the alarm (entStateAlarm: 
        unknown, underRepair, critical, major, minor, warning, 
        indeterminate) and the possible values of standby states  
        (entStateStandby: unknown, hotStandby, coldStandby, 
        providingService). 
         
        From a power monitoring point of view, in contrast to the entity 
        operational states of entities, Power Levels are required, as 
        proposed in the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB module.  Those 
        Power Levels can be mapped to the different operational states 
        in the ENTITY-STATE MIB, if a formal mapping is required.  For 
        example, the entStateStandby "unknown", "hotStandby", 
        "coldStandby", states could map to the Power Level "unknown", 
        "ready", "standby", respectively, while the entStateStandby 
        "providingService" could map to any "low" to "high" Power Level.

     7.3. Link with the POWER-OVER-ETHERNET MIB  

        Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] provides energy monitoring and 
        configuration framework for power over Ethernet devices.  The 
        RFC introduces a concept of a port group on a switch to define 
        power monitoring and management policy and does not use the 
        entPhysicalIndex as index.   
         
        One cannot assume that the Power-over-Ethernet MIB is 
        implemented for all Power Monitors that need to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol such as BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the pmethPortIndex and 
        pmethPortGrpIndex values contain the zero value, thanks to new 
        PethPsePortIndexOrZero and textual PethPsePortGroupIndexOrZero 
        conventions. 
      
        However, if the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, 
        the Power Monitor pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex contain 
        the pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively. 
         
        As a consequence, the pmIndex MIB object has been kept as the 
        unique Power Monitor index. 
         
        Note that, even the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] was 
        created after the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433], it does not reuse 
        the precision notion from the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB, i.e. the 
        entPhySensorPrecision MIB object. 
         
          
     7.4. Link with the UPS MIB 

        To protect against unexpected power disruption, data centers and 
        buildings make use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).  To 
        protect critical assets, a UPS can be restricted to a particular 
        subset or domain of the network.  UPS usage typically can last 
        only for a finite period of time, until normal power supply is 
        restored.  Planning is required to decide on the capacity of UPS 
        based on output power and duration of probable power outage.  
        From a power provisioning point of view of a data center or 
        building, it is important to understand the total demand 
        required to support all the entities in order to plan on the 
        capacity of the UPS to be installed.  This demand can be 
        monitored via the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB.  

        UPS MIB [RFC1628] provides information on the state of the UPS 
        network.  Implementation of UPS MIB is useful at the aggregate 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires January 12, 2010          [Page 29] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>          July 2010 
      
        level of a data center or a building.  The MIB module contains 
        several groups of variables - upsIdent - to identify the UPS 
        entity (name, model,..), the upsBattery group - to indicate the 
        battery state, (upsbatteryStatus, upsEstimatedMinutesRemaining, 
        ...), upsInput group - to characterize the input load to the UPS 
        (number of input lines, voltage, current,...) , upsOutput - to 
        characterize the output from the UPS (number of output lines, 
        voltage, current,...), upsAlarms - to indicate the various alarm 
        events.  The measurement of power in UPS MIB are in Volts,  Amps 
        and Watts.  The units of power measurement are RMS volts, RMS 
        Amps and are not based on EntitySensorDataScale and 
        EntitySensorDataPrecision of Entity-Sensor MIB. 

        Both the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB and the UPS MIB may be 
        implemented on the same UPS SNMP agent, without conflict.  In 
        such a case, the UPS device itself would be the Power Monitor 
        Parent and any the UPS meters or submeters would be the Power 
        Monitor Children. 
         
         
     7.5. Link with the LLDP and LLDP-MED MIBs 

        The LLDP Protocol is a Data Link Layer protocol used by network 
        devices for advertising of their identities, capabilities, and 
        interconnections on a LAN network.  
         
        The Media Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement of LLDP, known as 
        LLDP-MED.  The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically address voice 
        applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas - capabilities 
        discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, network policy 
        discovery, location identification discovery, inventory 
        discovery, and power discovery.   
         
        Of particular interest to the current MIB module is the power 
        discovery, which allows the end device such as a PoE phone to 
        convey power requirement to the switch.  In the power discovery, 
        the LLDP-MED has four Type Length Value (TLV): power type, power 
        source, power priority and power value.  Respectively, those 
        TLVs provide information related to the type of power (power 
        sourcing entity versus powered device), how the device is 
        powered (from the line, from a backup source, from external 
        power source, etc.), the power priority (how important is it 
        that this device has power?), and how much power the device 
        needs. 
          
        The power priority specified in the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MED-MIB] 
        actually comes from the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621]. If 
        the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, the exact 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires January 12, 2010          [Page 30] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>          July 2010 
      
        value from the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621] is copied over 
        in the lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority [LLDP-MED-MIB], otherwise 
        the value in lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority is "unknown". From 
        the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB, it is possible to identify 
        the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621], thanks to the 
        pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex. 
         
        The lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource [LLDP-MED-MIB] is similar to 
        pmPowerOrigin to indicate if the power for an attached device is 
        local or from a remote device. If LLDP-MED MIB is supported, the 
        following mapping can be applied to the pmPowerOrigin; 
        lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource fromPSE(2) and local(3) can be 
        mapped to remote(2) and self(1), respectively. 
      
      
     8. Structure of the MIB 

       The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the 
       PowerMonitorMIBObject.  The pmTable table of 
       PowerMonitorMibObject describes an entity in the network that is 
       a Power Monitor. 
         
       A Power Monitor contains information to describe the entity in 
       the context of the network (such as its Power Monitor Meter 
       Domain pmDomainName) and attributes for describing its business 
       context (such as pmImportance, pmRoleDescription and 
       pmKeywords).  
        
       A Power Monitor contains information describing its 
       instantaneous power usage (pmPower) along with its instantaneous 
       power state (pmPowerLevel). Along with the power usage is 
       information describing how the power usage was determined (such 
       as pmPowerMeasurementCaliber and pmPowerOrigin) 
        
       A Power Monitor may also contain an optional pmPowerQuality 
       table that describes the electrical characteristics associated 
       with the current power state and usage. 
        
       A Power Monitor may contain an optional pmDemandEnergyTable to 
       describe energy information over time. 
        
       A Power Monitor may also contain optional battery information 
       associated with this entity.  
       EDITOR NOTE: since a merge between this draft and [QUITTEK-
       POWER-MIB] seems to be the direction that the OPSAWG IETF WG 
       wants to go, one idea is to copy the battery MIB module from 
       [QUITTEK-POWER-MIB].

            DESCRIPTION 
        "An enumerated integer value that represents the value of the 
        power policy level, a current power setting at which a Power 
        Monitor uses power. 
                 
        There are twelve power policy levels; divided into six  
        operational states, and six non-operational states.  The lowest 
        non-operational state is 1 and the highest is six.  Each non-
        operational state corresponds to an ACPI level [ACPI]. 
         
        Global and System level state between G3 (hard-off) and G1 
        (sleeping).  For operational levels, 6 is the lowest, and 12 the 
        highest (full power).  Each operational level represent a 
        performance state, and may be mapped to ACPI states P0 (maximum 
        performance & power) through P5 (minimum performance and minimum 
        power).   
                 
        An entity may have fewer power levels than twelve and would then 
        map several policy levels to the same power state.  Entities

        with more than twelve levels, would choose which twelve to 
        represent as power policy levels. 
                 
        Note that Power Monitor Parent MUST report some of the non 
        operational Power Levels of its Power Monitor Children who are 
        unable to report their Power Level.  A typical example a phone 
        which may notify its Power Monitor Parent that it will go into a 
        mechoff(1) or hibernate(3) state so that the Power Monitor 
        Parent can report the phone's current state, for example either 
        zero or 1 watt.  Conversely, a PC with Desktop and mobile 
        Architecture for System Hardware [DASH] out-of-band management 
        is an example where a Power Monitor Child can report its usage 
        and level even when in a non-operational state. 
                 
        In each of the non operational levels (from mechoff(1) to 
        ready(6)), the Power Level preceding it is expected to have a 
        lower power consumption and a longer delay in returning to an 
        operational state.  
         
         
                 mechoff(1)  : An off state where no entity features are 
                               available.  The entity is unavailable. 
                               No energy is being consumed and the power 
                               connector can be removed.  This  
                               corresponds to the level G3 in ACPI.   
                           
                 softoff(2)  : Similar to mechoff(1), but some  
                               components remain powered or receive 
                               trace power so that the entity  
                               can be woken from its off state.  In  
                               softoff(2), no context is saved and the  
                               device typically requires a complete boot  
                               when awakened.  This corresponds to level  
                               G2 in ACPI. 
         
                 hibernate(3): No entity features are available.  The 
                               entity may be woken up without requiring  
                               a complete boot, but the time for  
                               availability is longer than sleep(4). An  
                               example for state hibernate(3) is a save- 
                               to-disk state where DRAM context is not  
                               maintained. Typically, energy consumption  
                               is zero or close to zero.  This  
                               corresponds to level G1, S4 in ACPI. 
         
                 sleep(4)    : No entity features are available, except  
                               for out-of-band management, for example

                               An example for state sleep(4) is a save- 
                               to-RAM state, where DRAM context is  
                               maintained.  Typically, energy  
                               consumption is close to zero. This  
                               corresponds to level G1, S3 in ACPI. 
         
                 standby(5) : No entity features are available, except  
                              for out-of-band management, for example  
                              wake-up mechanisms. This mode is analogous   
                              to cold-standy.  The time for availability  
                              is longerthan ready(6).  For example, the  
                              processor context is not maintained.  
                              Typically, energy consumption is close to  
                              zero. This corresponds to level G1, S2 in  
                              ACPI.

                               analogous to hot-standy.  The entity can  
                               be quickly transitioned into an  
                               operational state.  For example,  
                               processors are not executing, but  
                               processor context is maintained. This  
                               corresponds to level G1, S1 in ACPI.

     10. Security Considerations 

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmDomainName, pmName, 
             pmRoleDescription, and/or pmUserDefinedPowerLevelName MAY 
             disrupt the power and energy collection, and therefore any 
             predefined policies defined in the network.  
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmPowerLevel and/or 
             pmUserDefinedPowerLevel MAY disrupt the power settings of

             the different Power Monitor, and therefore the level of 
             functionality of the respective Power Monitors. 
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmDemandControlTable MAY 
             disrupt the energy measurement in the pmDemandEnergyTable 
             table.  
      
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using 
        IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) 
        them. 
         

     11. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
               Descriptor            OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
               ----------            ----------------------- 
               PowerMonitorMIB         { mib-2 xxx } 
         
        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.

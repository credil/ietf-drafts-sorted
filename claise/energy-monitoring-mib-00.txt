     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>           Jan 2010 
       
              
         
     1. Introduction 

        This document defines a subset of the Management Information 
        Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols for 
        monitoring the power state and the energy consumption of network 
        elements, taking into account the requirements specified in 
        [POWER-MON-REQ].  In addition to energy monitoring, 
        functionality to configure the power state of network elements 
        is proposed. 
         
        The MIB module in this document has been designed in order to be 
        as flexible as possible, with twelve different power levels, in 
        accordance to the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface 
        SPECIFICATION (ACPI) specifications [ACPI]. 
         
        The target devices include: routers, switches, attached devices 
        such as Power over Ethernet (PoE) devices, middle boxes, home 
        energy gateway, hosts and servers, sensor proxy, etc.  However, 
        the monitoring and configuration should be available for 
        individual components of devices as well, such as line cards, 
        processor cards, hard drives, etc. when those components are 
        independent from a power state point of view.  Those targets 
        devices and components may be characterized by the power related 
        attributes of a physical entity present in ENTITY-MIB, even 
        though the ENTITY-MIB compliance is not a requirement. 
      
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to 
        the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 
        58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
      
     3. Terminology 

        EnergyMonitor Entity 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires Jan 13, 2011             [Page 4] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>           Jan 2010 
         
           An EnergyMonitor Entity is a system of one or more 
           components, that provides power or draws power. It can be 
           independently managed from a power monitoring and power state 
           configuration point of view.  This entity may be represented 
           by a physical component referenced using the EntPhysicalTable 
           from the Entity MIB RFC 2737.  
            
           Examples of EnergyMonitor Entities are a router line card, a 
           motherboard with a CPU, etc. 
            
         
        EnergyMonitor Level 
         
           A uniform way to classify power settings on an EnergyMonitor 
           Entity.  Levels are guidelines for the manufacturers of 
           entity (e.g., shut, hibernate, sleep, standby). 
            
         
        EnergyMonitor Scale 
         
           A scale used to represent smaller or larger quantities of 
           EnergyMonitor usage.  It conforms to the standard prefixes 
           for the SI (System International) units of measure.  The 
           value represents an exponent of 10. 
            
           For example, if current usage of an EnergyMonitor Entity is 
           3, it could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, 3 MW depending on the value 
           of EnergyMonitor Scale. 
         
         
     4. Concepts 

        EnergyMonitor Levels represent the one of twelve power 
        management states of an entity.  Each EnergyMonitor Level 
        corresponds to a global, system, and performance state in the 
        ACPI model.

     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>           Jan 2010 
         
        Operational states: 
                    7               G0, S0, P5       Low 
                    8               G0, S0, P4       Frugal 
                    9               G0, S0, P3       Medium 
                   10               G0, S0, P2       Reduced 
                   11               G0, S0, P1       High 
                   12               G0, S0, P0       Full 
         
        For example, the energy state of the EnergyMonitor Entity is 9, 
        to indicate the entity is medium power consumption operational 
        state. 
         
        The emEnergyUsageCategory MIB object, specified as a read-only 
        object, specifies the energy usage type of the EnergyMonitor 
        Entity: energy consumer, energy producer, meter-only, or energy 
        consumer-producer.  The emEnergyUsage, specified as Integer32,  
        can have a positive and negative value, allowing to double-check 
        the usage type in emEnergyUsageCategory, or determining whether 
        the EnergyMonitor Entity consumes or produces power in case of 
        "consumer-producer".              
      
        An Energy Monitor Entity can have a user defined name - emName, 
        an entityPhysicalIndex from the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133] and its a 
        unique energyMonitor index, emIndex.  That EnergyMonitor Entity 
        can be a member of a domain (a logical group). 
         
        A domain is a logical grouping of EnergyMonitor Entities from 
        the point of monitoring power consumption and also from the 
        point of control of those EnergyMonitor Entities.  Thus diverse 
        policies can be configured for EnergyMonitor Entities belonging 
        to different domains. 
         
        For example, a given EnergyMonitor Entity as described by the 
        emIndex, emPhysicalEntity and enName. For that EnergyMonitor 
        Entity, the energy measurement and power state is reported as 
        follows.  The units of measurement emEnergyUnits is "watts" 
        (value 1), the instantaneous power usage enEnergyUsage is 100 
        watts, while the maximum power consumption as prescribed by the 
        vendor emEnergyNamePlate is 300 watts.  The emEnergyUsageCaliber 
        indicates that the energy measurement is "presumed" (in other 
        words not actual).  The power state of that EnergyMonitor entity 
        EmEnergyLevel is "9" to indicate medium power usage and 
        emEnergyUsageCategory indicates the type of EnergyMonitor entity  
        consumer or producer of power or both.  In addition, the maximum 
        power consumption at the level emLevelMaxUsage is indicated as 
        150 watts.

     5. Structure of the MIB 

        The primary MIB object in this MIB module is 
        EnergyMonitorMIBObjects. 
      
        The emTable table defines the EnergyMonitor Entities, with a 
        potential link to the entPhysicalIndex, when available.  The 
        EnergyMonitor Entities are used for describing and configuring 
        the entities that are possible candidates for power management.  
        The specific EnergyMonitor Level can be configured in the 
        emTable.  
         
        The emLevelTable table lists the maximum power usage at each 
        EnergyMonitor Level for each EnergyMonitor Entity. 
         
        Finally, the monitoring of all the EnergyMonitor Entities on the 
        SNMP agent can be turned on/off with the emEnable MIB object. 
         
                     
     5.1. Link with the other IETF MIBs  

         
        RFC 4133 [RFC4133] defines the Entity MIB module that lists the 
        physical entities of a networking device (router, switch) and 
        those physical entities listed indexed by entPhysicalIndex.  
        From an energy management point of view, of interest are the 
        physical entities that consume or produce energy.  The 
        EnergyMonitor Entities that are not modeled by entPhysicalIndex  
        (for e.g. CPU, Memory, storage systems, ...) can be indexed with 
        zero value in emPhysicalEntity, thanks to PhysicalIndexOrZero 
        textual convention.  If there are multiple entities with zero as 
        an index, in order to distinguish between multiple entities, a 
        extra index emDeviceId has been proposed, which would ensure 
        uniqueness.  
         
        Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC-3621] provides energy monitoring 
        and configuration framework for power over Ethernet devices.  
        The RFC uses a concept of group of ports of a switch to define 
        power monitoring and management policy and does not use the 
        entPhysicalIndex as index.  For the purpose on hand, power 
        monitoring of components of networking devices, RFC 3621 can not 
        be applied.  
         
        RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB module provides 
        standardized way of obtaining information (current value of the  
        sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the data units 
        precision) from sensors embedded in networking devices.  Sensors 
        are associated with each index of entPhysicalIndex of the Entity 
        MIB [RFC4133].  While the focus of the Energy Monitoring MIB, is

        on measurement of energy consumption by networking equipment 
        indexed by the entity MIB, this MIB proposes different power 
        level states of networking equipment and a functionality to 
        configure the power level states. 
      
        RFC 4268 [RFC4268] gives the operational states (enabled, 
        disabled, testing) and alarm states and usage states (idle, 
        active, busy) of the entities in the entity MIB.  From an energy 
        monitoring point of view, different state models need to be 
        developed.  The Energy Monitoring MIB proposes the power states 
        of entities in the Entity MIB.

            DESCRIPTION 
                "An enumerated integer value that represents the value 
                of EnergyMonitor Level, a power setting at which a 
                EnergyMonitor Entity uses power. 
                 
                The EnergyMonitor Levels are divided into six 
                operational states, and six non-operational states.  
                Each non-operational state corresponds to an ACPI 
                (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface 
                Specification, http://www.acpi.info/spec30b.htm)

                performance state, and correspond to ACPI states P0 
                (maximum performance & power) through P5 (minimum 
                performance and minimum power).   
                 
                EnergyMonitor Entities need not support all levels, but 
                a subset of the levels that can be mapped to their 
                system state. 
         
                 mechoff(1)  : An off state.  No entity features are 
                               available.  The entity is unavailable. 
                               No power is being consumed and the power 
                               Connector can be removed.  This maps to  
                               the level G3 in ACPI. 
         
                 softoff(2)  : Similar to off, but some components  
                               remain powered so the device can be woken  
                               from its off state.  In soft-off, no 
                               context is saved and the device requires 
                               a complete boot when awakened.  This maps 
                               to level G2 in ACPI. 
         
                 hibernate(3): No entity features are available.  The 
                               entity may be available but the time  
                               for availability is longer than sleep. 
                               This is generally the same as save-to- 
                               disk where DRAM context is not  
                               maintained. Minimal, nearly zero, or zero  
                               power is consumed.  This maps to level  
                               G1, S4 in ACPI. 
         
                 sleep(4)    : No entity features are available.  The  
                               entity may be available but the time  
                               for availability is longer than  
                               standby. This is generally the same as 
                               save-to-RAM, where DRAM context is  
                               maintained.  Minimal power is consumed.  
                               This maps to level G1, S3 in ACPI. 
         
                 standby(5)  : Indicates some entity features may not be 
                               available.  The entity may be available  
                               but the time for availability is longer 
                               than ready.  Processor context is not  
                               maintained.  Minimal power is consumed. 
                               This maps to level G1, S2 in ACPI. 
         
                 ready(6)    : Indicates some entity features may not 
                               be available.  The entity itself may be 
                               available but there may be a time delay 
                               for availability.  Processors are not

                               consumed.  This maps to level G1, S1 in

     7. Security Considerations 

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
        All other objects and tables contain no data that is considered 
        sensitive. 
         
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using 
        IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires Jan 13, 2011            [Page 22] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>           Jan 2010 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) 
        them. 
         

     8. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
               Descriptor            OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
               ----------            ----------------------- 
               EnergyMonitorMIB         { mib-2 xxxxx } 
         
        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.

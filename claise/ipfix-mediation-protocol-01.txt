        TO DO 
       - This draft is basically a starting point: multiple open issues 
          must be discussed throughout the draft 
       - What should we export in terms of Original Exporter? A 
          specific Options Template? 
       - Should we export the aggregation function for an IPFIX 
          Concentrator? 
       - Do we want to have an aggregate observation point? 
       - Review the problem statement, section 6 "IPFIX Mediators 
          Implementation Specific Problems" to see if we covered all 
          problems 
       - See the EDITOR'S NOTE within the document 
        
         
     1. Introduction 

        The IPFIX architectural components in [RFC5470] consist of 
        IPFIX Devices and IPFIX Collectors communicating using the 
        IPFIX protocol [RFC5101], which specifies how to export IP 
        Flow information.  This protocol is designed to export 
        information about IP traffic Flows and related measurement 
        data, where a Flow is defined by a set of key attributes 
        (e.g. source and destination IP address, source and 
        destination port, etc.).  
         
        However, thanks to its Template mechanism, the IPFIX protocol 
        can export any type of information, as long as the relevant 
        Information Element is specified in the IPFIX Information 
        Model [RFC5102], registered with IANA, or specified as an 
        enterprise-specific Information Element.The specifications in 
        the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] have not been defined in the 
        context of an IPFIX Mediator 
        receiving/aggregating/correlating/anonymizing/etc... Flow 
        Records from the one or multiple Exporters.  Indeed, the 
        IPFIX protocol must be adapted for Intermediate Processes, as 
        defined in the IPFIX Mediation Reference Model (Figure A of 
        [IPFIX-MED-FMWK], which is based on the IPFIX Mediation 
        Problem Statement [IPFIX-MED-PS]. 
         
        This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export 
        (IPFIX) protocol specific to the IPFIX Mediator.  These 
        specifications are based on the IPFIX protocol

        specifications but adapted according to the IPFIX Mediation 
        Framework [IPFIX-MED-FMWK]. 
         
      
     1.1. IPFIX Documents Overview 

        The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators 
        with access to IP Flow information. 
         
        The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow 
        information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting 
        Process is defined in the IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470], per 
        the requirements defined in RFC 3917 [RFC3917]. 
         
        The IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470] specifies how IPFIX Data 
        Records and Templates are carried via a congestion-aware 
        transport protocol from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX 
        Collecting Processes. 
         
        IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, 
        their name, type and additional semantic information, as 
        specified in the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102].   
         
        The IPFIX Applicability Statement [RFC5472] describes what 
        type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they 
        can use the information provided.  It furthermore shows how 
        the IPFIX framework relates to other architectures and 
        frameworks.  
         
        "IPFIX Mediation: Problem Statement" [IPFIX-MED-PS], describing 
        the IPFIX Mediation applicability examples, along with some 
        problems that network administrators have been facing, is the 
        basis for the "IPFIX Mediation: Framework" [IPFIX-MED-FMWK].  
        This framework details the IPFIX Mediation reference model and 
        the components of an IPFIX Mediator. 
         
      
         
     1.2. Relationship with IPFIX and PSAMP 

        The specification in this document applies to the IPFIX 
        protocol specifications [RFC5101].  All specifications from 
        [RFC5101] apply unless specified otherwise in this document. 
      
        As the Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol specifications 
        [RFC5476] are based on the IPFIX protocol specifications, the 
        specifications in this document are also valid for the PSAMP 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires October 8, 2010           [Page 4] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>     March 2010 
         

        protocol.  Therefore, the method specified by this document 
        also applies to PSAMP. 
         
         
     2. Terminology 

        The IPFIX-specific and PSAMP-specific terminology used in this 
        document is defined in [RFC5101] and [RFC5476], respectively.  
        The IPFIX Mediation-specific terminology used in this document 
        is defined in [IPFIX-MED-PS], and reuse in [IPFIX-MED-FMWK].  
        However, as reading the problem statements document is not a 
        prerequisite to reading this framework document, the definitions 
        have been reproduced here along with additional definitions.  In 
        this document, as in [RFC5101] and [RFC5476], the first letter 
        of each IPFIX-specific and PSAMP-specific term is capitalized 
        along with the IPFIX Mediation-specific term defined here. 
         
        In this document, we call "record stream" a stream of records 
        carrying flow- or packet-based information.  The records may be 
        encoded as IPFIX Data Records in any other format. 
         
        Transport Session Information 
         
        The Transport Session is specified in [RFC5101].  In SCTP, the 
        Transport Session Information is the SCTP association.  In TCP 
        and UDP, the Transport Session Information corresponds to a 5-
        tuple {Exporter IP address, Collector IP address, Exporter 
        transport port, Collector transport port, transport protocol}. 
         
        Original Exporter 
         
          An Original Exporter is an IPFIX Device that hosts the  
          Observation Points where the metered IP packets are observed. 
         
        IPFIX Mediation 
         
          IPFIX Mediation is the manipulation and conversion of a record 
          stream for subsequent export using the IPFIX protocol. 
         
        The following terms are used in this document to describe the 
        architectural entities used by IPFIX Mediation. 
         
        Intermediate Process 
         
          An Intermediate Process takes a record stream as its input 
          from Collecting Processes, Metering Processes, IPFIX File 
          Readers, other Intermediate Processes, or other record 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires October 8, 2010           [Page 5] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>     March 2010 
         

          sources; performs some transformations on this stream, based 
          upon the content of each record, states maintained across 
          multiple records, or other data sources; and passes the 
          transformed record stream as its output to Exporting 
          Processes, IPFIX File Writers, or other Intermediate 
          Processes, in order to perform IPFIX Mediation. Typically, an 
          Intermediate Process is hosted by an IPFIX Mediator. 
          Alternatively, an Intermediate Process may be hosted by an 
          Original Exporter. 
         
        Specific Intermediate Processes are described below.  However, 
        this is not an exhaustive list. 
         
        Intermediate Conversion Process 
         
          An Intermediate Conversion Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that transforms non-IPFIX into IPFIX, or manages the relation 
          among Templates and states of incoming/outgoing transport 
          sessions in the case of transport protocol conversion (e.g., 
          from UDP to SCTP). 
         
        Intermediate Aggregation Process 
         
          An Intermediate Aggregation Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that aggregates records based upon a set of Flow Keys or 
          functions applied to fields from the record (e.g., binning and 
          subnet aggregation). 
         
        Intermediate Correlation Process 
         
          An Intermediate Correlation Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that adds information to records, noting correlations among 
          them, or generates new records with correlated data from 
          multiple records (e.g., the production of bidirectional flow 
          records from unidirectional flow records). 
         
        Intermediate Selection Process 
         
          An Intermediate Selection Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that selects records from a sequence based upon criteria-
          evaluated record values and passes only those records that 
          match the criteria (e.g., filtering only records from a given 
          network to a given Collector). 
         
        Intermediate Anonymization Process 
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires October 8, 2010           [Page 6] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>     March 2010 
         

          An Intermediate Anonymization Process is an Intermediate 
          Process that transforms records in order to anonymize them, to 
          protect the identity of the entities described by the records 
          (e.g., by applying prefix-preserving pseudonymization of IP 
          addresses). 
         
        IPFIX Mediator 
         
          An IPFIX Mediator is an IPFIX Device that provides IPFIX 
          Mediation by receiving a record stream from some data sources, 
          hosting one or more Intermediate Processes to transform that 
          stream, and exporting the transformed record stream into IPFIX 
          Messages via an Exporting Process.  In the common case, an 
          IPFIX Mediator receives a record stream from a Collecting 
          Process, but it could also receive a record stream from data 
          sources not encoded using IPFIX, e.g., in the case of 
          conversion from the NetFlow V9 protocol [RFC3954] to IPFIX 
          protocol. 
         
      
     3. Specifications 

        This section describes the IPFIX specifications for Mediation.  
        These new specifications, which are more specific compared to 
        [RFC5101], are described with the key words described in 
        [RFC2119]. 
         
     3.1. Encoding of IPFIX Message Header 

        The format of the IPFIX Message Header is shown in Figure A. 
        Note that the format is similar to the IPFIX Message in 
        [RFC5101], but some field definitions (for the example, the 
        Export Time) have been updated in the context of the IPFIX 
        Mediator.

                Check the specific meaning of this field in the sub-
                sections of section 10 when UDP or TCP is selected as 
                the transport protocol.  This value SHOULD be used by 
                the Collecting Process to identify whether any IPFIX

        Observation Domain ID 

                A 32-bit identifier of the Observation Domain that is 
                locally unique to the Exporting Process.  The Exporting 
                Process uses the Observation Domain ID to uniquely 
                identify to the Collecting Process the Observation 
                Domain that metered the Flows.  It is RECOMMENDED that 
                this identifier is also unique per IPFIX 
                Device.  Collecting Processes SHOULD use the Transport 
                Session and the Observation Domain ID field to separate 
                different export streams originating from the same 
                Exporting Process.  The Observation Domain ID SHOULD be 
                0 when no specific Observation Domain ID is relevant for 
                the entire IPFIX Message.  For example, when exporting 
                the Exporting Process Statistics, or in case of 
                hierarchy of Collector when aggregated data records are 
                exported. 
                 
                EDITOR'S NOTE: make the link with section 3.4.1.   
      

     3.2. Template Management 

     3.2.1. Template Management Without Template Record Change 

        The first case is a situation where the IPFIX Mediator, 
        typically an IPFIX Distributor, relays an (Options) Template 
        without changing its content.  
         
        As in [RFC5101], the Template IDs are unique per Exporter, per 
        Transport Session, and per Observation Domain.  As there is no 
        guarantee that, for similar Template Records, the Template IDs 
        received on the incoming Transport Session and exported to the 
        outgoing Transport Session would be same, the IPFIX Mediator 
        MUST maintain a mapping database between received and exported 
        (Options) Template Records: 
       - for each Received (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
          Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Original Exporter, 
          Observation Domain, and Transport Session 
       - for each Exported (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
          Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Collector, 
          Observation Domain, and Transport Session 
         
        If an IPFIX Mediator receives an IPFIX Withdrawal Message for a 
        (Options) Template Record that is not used anymore in any 
        outgoing Transport Sessions, the IPFIX Mediator SHOULD export he 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires October 8, 2010           [Page 9] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>     March 2010 
         

        appropriate IPFIX Withdrawal Message(s) on the outgoing 
        Transport Session, and remove the corresponding entry in its 
        mapping database. 
         
        If a (Options) Template Record is not used anymore in outgoing 
        Transport Session, it MUST be withdrawn with an IPFIX Template 
        Withdrawal Message on that specific outgoing Transport Session, 
        and remove the corresponding entry in its mapping database. 
          
         
        If an incoming Transport Session is gracefully shutdown or 
        reset, the (Options) Template Records corresponding to that 
        Transport Session MUST be removed from the mapping database.  
         
      
      
     3.2.2. Template Management With Template Record Change 

        The second case is a situation where the IPFIX Mediator, 
        typically an IPFIX Concentrator or an IPFIX Masquerading Proxy, 
        generates new (Options) Template compared to what it receives 
        from the Original Exporters. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: to be completed. This is slightly more complex as 
        we have to introduce the notion of derived (Options) Template 
        Records. 

         
     3.3. Time Management 

        The IPFIX Message Header "Export Time" field is the time in 
        seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1, 1970, at which the IPFIX Message 
        Header leaves the IPFIX Mediator.  However, in the specific case 
        of an IPFIX Mediator containing an Intermediate Conversion 
        Process, the IPFIX Mediator MAY keep the export time received 
        from the incoming Transport Session. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that Mediators handle time using absolute 
        timestamps (e.g. flowStartSeconds, flowStartMilliseconds, 
        flowStartNanoseconds), which are specified relative to the UNIX 
        epoch (00:00 UTC 1 Jan 1970), where possible, rather than 
        relative timestamps (e.g. flowStartSysUpTime, 
        flowStartDeltaMicroseconds), which are specified relative to 
        protocol structures such as system initialization or message 
        export time.   
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires October 8, 2010          [Page 10] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>     March 2010 
         

        The latter are difficult to manage for two reasons.  First, they 
        require constant translation, as the system initialization time 
        of an intermediate system and the export time of an intermediate 
        message will change across mediation operations.  Further, 
        relative timestamps introduce range problems.   
         
        For example, when using the flowStartDeltaMicroseconds and 
        flowEndDeltaMicroseconds Information Elements [RFC5102], the 
        Data Record must be exported within a maximum of 71 minutes 
        after its creation.  Otherwise, the 32-bit counter would not be 
        sufficient to contain the flow start time offset.  Those time 
        constraints might be incompatible with some of the Intermediate 
        Processes: Intermediate Aggregation Process (temporal) and 
        Intermediate Correlation Process, for example. 
         
        When an Intermediate Aggregation Process aggregates information 
        from different Flow Records, the typical reporting times are the 
        minimum of the start times and the maximum of the end times.  
        However, if the Flow Records do not overlap, i.e. if there is a 
        time gap between the times in the Flow Records, then the report 
        may be inaccurate.  The IPFIX Mediator is only reporting what it 
        knows, on the basis of the information made available to it - 
        and there may not have been any data to observe during the gap. 
        Then again, if there is an overlap in timestamps, there's the 
        potential of double-accounting: different Observation Points may 
        have observed the same traffic simultaneously.  Therefore, as 
        there is not a single rule that fits all different situations, 
        the precise rules of applying the Flow Record timestamps in 
        IPFIX Mediators is out of the scope of this document. 
         
         
     3.4. Observation Point Management 

        Generally, top Collector needs to be able to distinguish the 
        real original Exporters, otherwise it may wrongly conclude that 
        the IPFIX Mediator contains the Observation Point(s) where the 
        Flow Records were observed.  A new Information Element 
        originalExporterIPaddress is introduced. 

        When an IPFIX Mediator exports the originalExporterIPaddress, it 
        needs to export other information indicating that an IPFIX 
        Mediator certificates the original exporter IP address. 
        ExporterCertificate in [RFC5655] can be used in that case.  And 
        also, another Information Element indicating that certifies that 
        an IPFIX Mediator is required, just like mediatorCertificate.

        EDITOR'S NOTE: Do we want a structure data representing the list 
        of all observation points in case of an Intermediate Aggregation 
        Process? 
         

     3.4.1. Observation Domain Management 

        When mixing Data Records from multiple IPFIX Messages received 
        from multiple Observation Domains, or generating new Data 
        Records from the result of some intermediate function on Data 
        Records from multiple IPFIX Messages received from multiple 
        Observation Domains, a Mediator MUST assign a new Observation 
        Domain ID for the exported IPFIX Messages.  This Observation 
        Domain ID is unique per Intermediate Process instance.  This is 
        consistent with the preservation guideline above, as in most if 
        not all such circumstances, the IPFIX Mediator will be 
        generating new Templates itself as a consequence of the 
        mediation being performed. 
         
        If the IPFIX Mediator must export information about the original 
        Exporter IP address and the original Observation Domain Id 
        (typically a router line card), the IPFIX Mediator MUST include  
        the orginalExporterIPAddress and originalObservationDomainId 
        Information Elements in the Flow Records. 
         
         

     3.5. Specific Reporting Requirements 

        Some specific Options Templates and Options Template Records are 
        necessary to provide extra information about the Flow Records 
        and about the Metering Process. 
         
        The Option Template and Options Template Records defined in 
        these subsections, which impose some constraints on the Metering 
        Process and Exporting Process implementations, MAY be 
        implemented.  If implemented, the specific Option Templates 
        SHOULD be implemented as specified in these subsections. 
         
        The minimum set of Information Elements is always specified in 
        these Specific IPFIX Options Templates.  Nevertheless, extra 
        Information Elements may be used in these specific Options 
        Templates.

     3.5.1. The Flow Keys Options Template 

        Exactly like the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101], the Flow Keys Option 
        Template specifies the structure of a Data Record for reporting 
        the Flow Keys of reported Flows.  A Flow Keys Data Record 
        extends a particular Template Record that is referenced by its 
        templateId identifier.  The Template Record is extended by 
        specifying which of the Information Elements contained in the 
        corresponding Data Records describe Flow properties that serve 
        as Flow Keys of the reported Flow. 
        The Flow Keys Option Template SHOULD contain the following 
        Information Elements that are defined in [RFC5102] 
           templateId              An identifier of a Template.  This 
                                   Information Element MUST be defined  
                                   as a Scope Field. 
         
           flowKeyIndicator        Bitmap with the positions of the Flow  
                                   Keys in the Data Records. 
        When any Intermediate Process changes the Flow Keys, the Flow 
        Keys Option Template MUST include the new set of Flow Keys. 
        Typically, an Intermediate Aggregation Process keeps or reduces 
        the number of Flow Keys 
         
     3.5.2. IPFIX Protocol Options Template 

        The "Metering Process Statistics Options Template", "The 
        Metering Process Reliability Statistics Options Template", and 
        "The Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Options Template", 
        as specified in [RFC5101], SHOULD be implemented on the IFPIX 
        Mediator. 
         
     3.5.3. IPFIX Mediator Options Template 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: we don't think we need a specific Options 
        Template for the IPFIX Mediator; instead, each mediation 
        function which has some useful metadata (for example, [IPFIX-
        ANON] should define its own Options Template Record(s). They 
        should simply all look like each others. 
         
        For example, a specification of IPFIX flow anonymisation 
        including an Options Template for the export of metadata about 
        anonymised flows is described in [IPFIX-ANON]; when anonymising 
        Flows Records, IPFIX Mediators SHOULD add the Options Template 
        specified therein to annotate the exported data.

     3.5.4. The Flow Key List Options Template 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: TO BE DISCUSSED 

        Even when an IPFIX Mediator aggregates original Flow Records, 
        IPFIX Collector needs to know the number of original Flow 
        Records.  In that case, an IPFIX Mediator needs to export this 
        data.  However, the term of Flows in IPFIX means all of Flow 
        Records even if they have different Flow Keys.  Therefore, 
        another method presenting Flow Keys rather than bit map is 
        required. 
         
        (I propose) The following Options Template using basicList in 
        draft-ietf-ipfix-structured-data-00 can be applied. 

         
        - flows as a scope 
        - basicList 
         
        The basicList contains the informationElementId list indicating 
        Flow Keys. Thus, the following IE also needs to be defined. 
         
        - Flows 
         
        This information indicates the number of original Flow Records. 
        When using this IEs, set of Flow keys SHOULD be presented in 
        Flow Key List Options Template. However, when an IPFIX Mediator 
        aggregates original Flow Records that have different Flow Keys, 
        the IPFIX Mediator cannot export "Flows". 
         
         
     3.6. Transport Session Management 

        SCTP [RFC4960] using the PR-SCTP extension specified in 
        [RFC3758] MUST be implemented by all compliant IPFIX Mediator 
        implementations.  UDP [UDP] MAY also be implemented by compliant 
        IPFIX Mediator implementations.  TCP [TCP] MAY also be 
        implemented by IPFIX Mediator compliant implementations. 

        PR-SCTP SHOULD be used in deployments where IPFIX Mediators and 
        Collectors are communicating over links that are susceptible to 
        congestion.  PR-SCTP is capable of providing any required degree 
        of reliability. 

        TCP MAY be used in deployments where IPFIX Mediators and 
        Collectors communicate over links that are susceptible to 
        congestion, but PR-SCTP is preferred due to its ability to limit 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires October 8, 2010          [Page 14]

        back pressure on Exporters and its message versus stream 
        orientation.  

        UDP MAY be used, although it is not a congestion-aware protocol. 
        However, the IPFIX traffic between IPFIX Mediator and Collector 
        MUST run in an environment where IPFIX traffic has been 
        provisioned for, or is contained through some other means. 
         

     3.7. The Collecting Process's Side 

        If we change something on the protocol, the Collecting Process 
        must be able to support it. 
        For example, if we impose that the new O.P. is a structured data 
        composed of different remote O.P., then the C.P. must support 
        structured data. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: to be completed 
         
         
     3.8. Sampling Management 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: What about the accuracy of aggregated Flow 
        Records with the sampling rates? With different sampling rates? 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: similarly, shouldn't this section be handled in 
        the adopted -sampling draft?  
        Potentially.  
        Maybe but we could write a sentence such: 
        "if the Mediation aggregates flow records with sampling rate, 
        the new sampling rate must be calculated" 
        Or maybe 
        "the Mediation can't aggregate flow records with different 
        sampling rate" 
        Or each sampled data stream should be normalised, and the 
        normalised streams merged before being resampled. Eg if one 
        incoming stream is 1:2 and another is 1:3, while the desired 
        outbound stream is 1:5, the MD must do (2 x stream1 + 3 x 
        stream2) / 5. In this case, not sure what would happen in terms 
        of accuracy. 
        Or ... 
         
        In an IPFIX Mediation, aggregation for Flow Records with same 
        sampling rate and same sampling algorithm is recommended. In 
        that case, an IPFIX Mediator can export the sampling rate and 
        sampling algorithm, and other accuracy statistics data.

     3.9. Filtering Management 

        EDITOR'S QUESTION: What should we do in terms of filtering? 
        Should we try to export the filtering function? Note that, in 
        some cases, it doesn't even make sense: if filter X was applied 
        on stream1 and filter Y on stream2. If we're sending (red apples 
        + green pears) to the collector, these filters make sense 
        individually, but together? I'm not sure that they do. 

     4. New Intermediate Function 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: How should new intermediate functions be plugged 
        into this protocol? OR maybe this is a framework question? 
      
         
     5. New Information Elements 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: to be discussed 
      
        - orginalExporterIpAddress 
        - orginalObservationDomainId? 
        - mediatorCertificate? 
         
        Maybe the following ones should be defined in a specific flow 
        aggregation draft: 
        - Maximum counter or minimum counter for packets or bytes 
        - activeTime and inactiveTime for Flow aggregation 
          
         
     6. Security Considerations 

        The same security considerations as for the IPFIX Protocol 
        [RFC5101] apply. 
         
        As they act as both IPFIX Collecting Processes and Exporting 
        Processes, the Security Considerations for IPFIX [RFC5101] apply 
        as well to Mediators.  The Security Considerations for IPFIX 
        Files [RFC5655] apply as well to IPFIX Mediators that write 
        IPFIX Files or use them for internal storage.  However, there 
        are a few specific considerations that IPFIX Mediator 
        implementations must take into account in addition. 
         
        By design, IPFIX Mediators are "men-in-the-middle": they 
        intercede in the communication between an Original Exporter (or 
        another upstream Mediator) and a downstream Collecting Process. 
        This has two important implications for the level of 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>       Expires October 8, 2010          [Page 16] 
         
     Internet-Draft     <Protocol for IPFIX Mediations>     March 2010 
         

        confidentiality provided across an IPFIX Mediator, and the 
        ability to protect data integrity and Original Exporter 
        authenticity across a Mediator. We address these in the 
        following subsections. 
         
         
     6.1. Avoiding Security Downgrade 

        An IPFIX Mediator that accepts IPFIX Messages over a Transport 
        Session protected by TLS or DTLS, and which then exports IPFIX 
        Messages derived there from in cleartext, is a potentially 
        serious vulnerability in an IPFIX infrastructure.  While this is 
        potentially acceptable in the specific case of an IPFIX Mediator 
        at the border of an administrative domain accepting IPFIX 
        Messages from outside the domain and re-exporting derived 
        information via an internal network protected by other means, in 
        the general case this situation SHOULD be avoided. 
         
        Therefore, an IPFIX Mediator that receives IPFIX Messages from 
        an upstream Exporting Process protected using TLS or DTLS MUST 
        provide for sending of IPFIX Messages resulting from the 
        Intermediate Process to a downstream Collecting Process using 
        TLS or DTLS.  It MAY allow for the configuration of unprotected 
        export of such IPFIX Messages, but in this case it MUST warn the 
        administrator that the exported IPFIX Messages will not be 
        protected, and that this could result in the leakage of 
        information deemed by the Original Exporter to be worth 
        protecting. 
         
         
     6.2. End-to-End Assertions for Mediators 

        Because the Transport Session between an IPFIX Mediator and an 
        Original Exporter is independent from the Transport Session 
        between the Mediator and the downstream Collecting Process, 
        there exists no method via TLS to assert the identity of the 
        original Exporting Process downstream.  However, an IPFIX 
        Mediator, which modifies the stream of IPFIX Messages sent to 
        it, is by definition a trusted entity in the infrastructure.  
        Therefore, the IPFIX Mediator's signature on an outgoing 
        Transport Session can be treated as an implicit assertion that 
        the Original Exporter was positively identified by the Mediator 
        and that the source information it received was trustworthy. 
        However, IPFIX Mediators must in this circumstance take care not 
        to provide an inappropriate upgrade of trust.

        Therefore, an IPFIX Mediator SHOULD NOT sign a Transport Session 
        to a downstream Collector unless ALL the Original Exporters from 
        which the information to be exported is derived were positively 
        identified by the Mediator by its certificate.  An exception to 
        this case is the reverse of the special case in the previous 
        subsection: an IPFIX Mediator that accepts information from 
        within a trusted domain via an internal network protected by 
        other means MAY use TLS or DTLS to protect the Transport Session 
        to a downstream Collector outside the domain. 
         
        [EDITOR OPEN ISSUE: We might want to use exporterCertificate and 
        (optionally) collectorCertificate from [RFC5655] here, but I 
        think they need a new Mediator-specific template if so.  If we 
        were to use the templates defined by 5655, it would look like 
        this:] 
         
        If the X.509 certificates used to protect a Transport Session 
        between an Original Exporter and an IPFIX Mediator are required 
        downstream, an IPFIX Mediator MAY use the exporterCertificate 
        and the collectorCertificate Information Elements with the 
        Export Session Details Options Template defined in Section 8.1.3 
        of [RFC5655] or the Message Details Options Template defined in 
        Section 8.1.4. of [RFC5655] in order to export this information 
        downstream. However, in this case, the IPFIX Mediator is making 
        an implicit assertion that the upstream Session was properly 
        protected and therefore trustworthy, and as such MUST protect 
        the Transport Session to the downstream Collector using TLS or 
        DTLS, as well.

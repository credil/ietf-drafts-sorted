     1. Overview 

     1.1. IPFIX Documents Overview 

      The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators with 
      access to IP Flow information. 
       
      The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow information 
      out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting Process is 
      defined in the IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470], per the requirements 
      defined in RFC 3917 [RFC3917]. 
       
      The IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470] specifies how IPFIX Data Records 
      and Templates are carried via a congestion-aware transport 
      protocol from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX Collecting 
      Processes. 
       
      IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, 
      their name, type and additional semantic information, as specified 
      in the IPFIX information model [RFC5102]. 
       
      In order to gain a level of confidence in the IPFIX 
      implementation, probe the conformity and robustness, and allow 
      interoperability, the Guidelines for IPFIX Testing [RFC5471] 
      presents a list of tests for implementers of compliant Exporting 
      Processes and Collecting Processes. 
      
      The Bidirectional Flow Export [RFC5103] specifies a method for 
      exporting bidirectional flow (biflow) information using the IP 
      Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol, representing each Biflow 
      using a single Flow Record. 
      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011  [Page 4]

      The "Reducing Redundancy in IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) and 
      Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Reports" [RFC5473] specifies a bandwidth 
      saving method for exporting Flow or packet information, by 
      separating information common to several Flow Records from 
      information specific to an individual Flow Record: common Flow 
      information is exported only once. 
      
      
      
     2. Introduction 

      Today service providers and network administrators are looking for 
      visibility into the packet content rather than just the packet 
      header.  Some network devices Metering Processes inspect the 
      packet content and identify the applications that are utilizing 
      the network traffic.  Applications in this context are defined as 
      networking protocols used by networking processes that exchange 
      packets between them (such as the web applications, peer to peer 
      applications, file transfer, e-mail applications, etc.). Combined 
      with other information elements, some of which being application 
      specific, the applications can be further characterized.  
      Examples include: web application to a specific domain, per user 
      specific traffic, a video application with a specific codec, 
      etc... 
       
      The application identification is based on different kind of 
      methods or even a combination of such methods:  
      1. L2 protocols (such as ARP, PPP, LLDP) 
      2. IP protocols (such as ICMP, IGMP, GRE) 
      3. TCP or UDP ports (such as HTTP, Telnet, FTP) 
      4. Application layer header (of the application to be identified) 
      5. Packet data content  
      6. Packets and traffic behavior 
       
      The exact application identification methods are part of the 
      Metering Process internals that aims to provide an accurate 
      identification with a minimum false identification.  This task 
      requires a sophisticated Metering Process since the protocols do 
      not behave in a standard manner. 
      1. Applications use port obfuscation where the application run on 
        different port than the IANA assigned one.  For example a HTTP 
        server might run a TCP port 23 (assigned to telnet in [IANA-
        PORTS]) 
      2. IANA does not accurately reflect how certain ports are 
        "commonly" used today.  Some ports are reserved, but the 

      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011  [Page 5] 
                                         
     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

        application either never became prevalent or is not in use 
        today.  
      3. The application behavior and identification logic become more 
        and more complex 
      
      For that reason, such Metering Processes usually detect 
      application based on multiple mechanisms in parallel.  Detecting 
      applications based only on port matching might wrongly identify 
      the traffic.  Note that this example stresses the need for the 
      engine strength.  If the Metering Process is capable of detecting 
      applications more accurately it is considered as stronger and more 
      accurate. 
       
      Similarly, a reporting mechanism that uses L4 port based 
      applications only, such as L4:<known port>, would have a similar 
      issues.  The reporting system should be capable of reporting the 
      applications classified using all types for mechanisms.  In 
      particular applications that does not have any IANA port 
      definition.  While a mechanism to export application information 
      should be defined, the L4 port being in use must be exported using 
      the destination port (destinationTransportPort at [IANA-IPFIX]) in 
      the corresponding NetFlow record. 
       
      Cisco Systems uses the IPFIX application tag as described in 
      section 4. to export the application information with the IPFIX 
      protocol [RFC5101].  
       
      Application could be defined at different OSI layers, from the 
      layer 2 to the layer 7. Examples: Cisco Discovery Protocol is 
      layer 2 application, ICMP is layer 3 application [IANA-PROTO], 
      HTTP is layer 4 application [IANA-PORTS], and skype is layer 7. 
       
      While an ideal solution would be an IANA registry for applications 
      above (or inside the payload of) the well known ports [IANA-
      PORTS], this solution is not always possible as the some 
      applications require well known specifications.  Therefore, some 
      reverse engineering is required, as well as a ubiquitous language 
      for application identification.  Clearly not realistic. 
        
      As this specification focuses on the application information 
      encoding, this document doesn't contain an application registry 
      for non IANA applications.  However, a reference to the Cisco 
      assigned numbers for the Application Tag and the different 
      attribute assignments can be found at [CISCO].

     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

     2.1. Application Information Use Cases 

      There are several use cases on which the application information 
      is used: 
       
      1. Network Visibility 
         
        This is one of the main use cases for using the application 
        information.  This use case is also called application 
        visibility.  Network administrators are using such application 
        visibility to understand the main network consumers, network 
        trends and user behavior. 
         
      2. Billing Services 
         
        In some cases, network providers are willing to bill different 
        applications differently.  For example, provide different 
        billing for VoIP and Web browsing. 
         
      3. Congestion Control 
         
        While the traffic demand is increasing (mainly due to the high 
        usage of peer to peer applications, video applications and web 
        download applications),  the providers revenue doesn't grow. 
        Providers are looking at a more efficient way to control and 
        prioritize the network utilization.  An application aware 
        bandwidth control system is used to prioritize the traffic based 
        on the applications, giving the critical applications priority 
        over the non-critical applications. 
         
      4. Security Functions 
         
        Application knowledge is sometimes used in security functions in 
        order to provide comprehensive functions such as Application 
        based firewall,  URL filtering,  Parental control,  Intrusion 
        detection,  etc. 
         
      All of the above use cases require exporting of application 
      information to provide the network function itself or to log the 
      network function operation. 
      
      
     3. Terminology 

      IPFIX-specific terminology used in this document is defined in 
      Section 2 of the IPFIX protocol specification [RFC5101].  As in 

      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011  [Page 7] 
                                         
     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

      [RFC5101], these IPFIX-specific terms have the first letter of a 
      word capitalized when used in this document. 
       
       
     3.1. New Terminology 

      Application Tag 
       
          A unique identifier for an application.   
      
      
     4. applicationTag Information Element Specification 

        This document specifies the applicationTag Information Element, 
        which is composed of two parts: 
         
            1. 8 bits of Classification Engine ID. The Classification 
               Engine can be considered as a specific registry for 
               application assignment. 
            2. m bits of Selector ID. The Selector ID length varies 
               depending on the engine. 
         
      0                   1                   2                   3

                  Figure 1: applicationTag Information Element 
         
         
        Classification Engine ID 
         
          A unique identifier for the engine which determined the 
          Selector ID.  Thus the Classification Engine ID defines the 
          context for the Selector ID. 
         
        Selector ID 
         
          A unique identifier of the application for a specific 
          Classification Engine ID.  
         
        Note that the Selector ID term is in sync with the PSAMP 
        terminology.  See [RFC5476], Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Protocol 
        Specifications.  
      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011  [Page 8] 
                                         
     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

         
        When an application is detected, the most granular application 
        is encoded in the Application Tag: for example, ICMP would be 
        encoded as layer 3 value 1, SNMP as layer 4 value 161, bittorent 
        as layer 7 value 69. 
         
        The overall length of the applicationTag Information Element may 
        be specified either in the IPFIX Template Record or by using an 
        IPFIX Variable-Length Information Element. The receiver / 
        decoder must respect this length rather than using the 
        Classification Engine ID to make an assumption about the 
        Selector ID size. 
          
        When exporting applicationTag information in IPFIX, the 
        applicationTag SHOULD be encoded in a variable-length 
        Information Element [RFC5101].  However, if a legacy protocol 
        such as NetFlow version 9 is used, and this protocol doesn't 
        support variable length Information Elements, then either 
        multiple templates (one per applicationTag length), or a single 
        template corresponding to the maximum sized applicationTag MUST 
        be used. This avoids the need for multiple Template Records with 
        different applicationTag lengths when the IPFIX variable length 
        encoding [RFC5101] is not available. 
         
        As a consequence, although some Application Tags can be encoded 
        in a smaller number of bytes (eg, an IANA L3 protocol encoding 
        would take 2 bytes, while an IANA L4 port encoding would take 3 
        bytes), nothing prevents an Exporting Process from exporting all

        The following Engine IDs have been allocated by Cisco Systems. 
         
        Name         Value      Description

                                exported in the Selector ID. 
                                See

                                export its own layer 3 protocol 
                                numbers, while waiting for IANA to 
                                assign it. The Selector ID has a 
                                global significance for all Cisco 
                                Systems devices under CANA governance. 
                                Hopefully the same IDs will be 
                                maintained after the IANA 
                                standardization.

                                exported in the Selector ID. 
                                See 
                                http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-
                                numbers. 
                                Note: as a flow is unidirectional, it 
                                contains the destination port in a 
                                flow from the client to the server.  
        CANA-L4      4          Cisco Systems proprietary layer 4

                                export its own layer 4 port numbers, 
                                while waiting for IANA to assign it. 
                                The Selector ID has global 
                                significance for all Cisco Systems 
                                devices under CANA governance. 
                                Hopefully the same ID will be 
                                maintained after the IANA 
                                standardization. Example: IPFIX had 
                                the port 4739 pre-assigned in the IETF 
                                draft for years. While waiting for the 
                                IANA registration, we could use this 
                                Selector ID.

     4.2. Options Template Record for the Application Name 

        For engines which specify locally unique Application Tags (which 
        means unique per engine and per router), an Options Template 
        Record (see [RFC5101]) MUST be used to export the correspondence 
        between the Application Tag, the Application Name, and the 
        Application Description.  This is called the "options 
        application-table".  For engines which specify globally unique 
        Application Tags, an Options Template Record SHOULD be used to 
        export the correspondence between the Application Tag, the 
        Application Name and the Application Description, unless the 
        mapping is hardcoded in the NetFlow Collector, or known out of 
        band (for example, by polling a MIB).

     4.3. Resolving IANA L4 port collisions 

        Even if the IANA L4 ports usually point to the same protocols 
        for both UDP, TCP or other transport types, there are some 
        exceptions. The following table lists 10 ports that have 
        different protocols assigned for TCP and UDP: 
         
       exec            512/tcp    remote process execution; 
       #                          authentication performed using

           Table 3: IANA layer 4 port collisions between SCTP and TCP 
         
        Instead of imposing the transport protocol (UDP/TCP/SCTP/etc.) 
        in the scope of the "options application-table" Options Template 
        for all applications (on top of having the transport protocol as 
        key-field in the Flow Record definition), we define that the L4 
        application is always TCP related, by convention.  So, whenever 
        the Collector has a conflict in looking up IANA, it would choose 
        the TCP choice.  As a result, the UDP L4 applications from Table

        2 and the SCTP L4 applications from table 3 are assigned in the 
        Cisco L7 Application Tag range (ie, under Classification Engine 
        ID 13): 
       
        Currently, there are no discrepancies between the well known 
        ports for TCP and DCCP. 
         
     5. Grouping the Applications with the Attributes 

        Due to the high number of different application tags, 
        categorizing them into groups offers the benefits of easier 
        reporting and action, such as QoS policies.  Indeed, most 
        applications with the same characteristics should be treated the 
        same way; for example, all video traffic.  
         
       
        Attributes are statically assigned per application tag and are 
        independent of the traffic. The attributes are listed below: 
           
             Name                   Description 
                                     
             Category               An attribute that provides a first 
                                    level categorization for each 
                                    application tag. Examples include: 
                                    browsing, email, file-sharing, 
                                    gaming, instant messaging, voice-
                                    and-video, etc... 
                                    The category attribute is encoded by 
                                    the ApplicationCategoryName 
                                    Information Element. 
                                     
             Sub-Category           An attribute that provides a second 
                                    level categorization for each 
                                    application tag. Examples include: 
                                    backup-systems, client-server, 
                                    database, routing-protocol, etc... 
                                    The sub-category attribute is 
                                    encoded by the 
                                    ApplicationSubCategoryName 
                                    Information Element. 
                                     
             Application-           An attribute that groups multiple 
             Group                  application tags that belong to the 
                                    same networking application. For 
                                    example, the ftp-group contain the 
                                    ftp-data (port 20), ftp (port 20), 
                                    ni-ftp (port 47), sftp (port 115),

                                    574), ftps-data (port 989). The 
                                    application-group attribute is 
                                    encoded by the ApplicationGroupName 
                                    Information Element. 
                                     
             P2P-Technology         Specifies if the application tag is 
                                    based on peer-to-peer technology. 
                                    The P2P-technology attribute is 
                                    encoded by the p2pTechnology 
                                    Information Element. 
                                     
             Tunnel-                Specifies if the application tag is 
             Technology             used as a tunnel technology. The 
                                    tunnel-technology attribute is 
                                    encoded by the tunnelTechnolgoy 
                                    Information Element. 
                                     
             Encrypted              Specifies if the application tag is 
                                    an encrypted networking protocol. 
                                    The encrypted attribute is encoded 
                                    by the encryptedTechnology 
                                    Information Element. 
      
              Table 4: Existing Application Tag Static Attributes 
           
         
        Every application is assigned to one ApplicationCategoryName, 
        one ApplicationSubCategoryName, one ApplicationGroupName, has 
        one p2pTechnology, one tunnelTechnolgoy, and one 
        encryptedTechnology.   
     5.1. Options Template Record for the Attribute Values 

        An Options Template Record (see [RFC5101]) is used to export the 
        correspondence between each Application Tag and its related 
        Attribute values.  An alternative way for the Collecting Process 
        to learn the correspondence is to populate these mappings out of 
        band, for example, by loading a CSV file containing the 
        correspondence table. 
         
        The Attributes Option Template contains the ApplicationTag as a 
        scope field, followed by the ApplicationCategoryName, the 
        ApplicationSubCategoryName, the ApplicationGroupName, the 
        p2pTechnology,    the tunnelTechnolgoy, and the 
        encryptedTechnology Information Elements. 
      
      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011 [Page 16] 
                                         
     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

        A list of attributes may conveniently be exported using a 
        subTemplateList per [IPFIX-STRUCT]. 
         
        An example is given in section 6.8 below. 
         
      
     6. Application Tag Examples 

        The following examples are created solely for the purpose of 
        illustrating how the extensions proposed in this document are 
        encoded. 
      

     6.1. Example 1: Layer 2 Protocol 

        From the list of Classification Engine IDs in Table 1, we can 
        see that the layer 2 Classification Engine ID is 12: 
         
        L2        12    The Selector ID represents the layer 2 
                         applications. The Selector ID has a global 
                         significance. 
         
        From the list of layer 2 protocols at [cisco], we can see that 
        PPP has the value 24: 
         
        NAME    Selector ID 
        ppp     24 
         
        So, in the case of layer 2 protocol PPP, the Classification 
        Engine ID is 12 while the Selector ID has the value 24. 
          
        Therefore the Application Tag is encoded as: 
         
            0                   1            
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
           |       12      |      24       | 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         
        So the Application Tag has the value of 3097. Instead of 
        representing the Application Tag in hexadecimal format, the 
        format '12...24' is used for simplicity in the examples below. 
         
        Flexible NetFlow creates a Template Record with a few 
        Information Elements: amongst other things, the Application Tag. 
        For example: 
      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011 [Page 17] 
                                         
     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

         
        - sourceIPv4Address (key field) 
        - destinationIPv4Address (key field) 
        - ipDiffServCodePoint (key field) 
        - applicationTag (key field) 
        - octetTotalCount (non key field) 
         
        For example, a Flow Record corresponding to the above Template 
        Record may contain: 
         
            { sourceIPv4Address=1.1.1.1, destinationIPv4Address=2.2.2.2, 
              ipDiffServCodePoint=0, applicationTag='12...24', 
              octetTotalCount=123456 } 
         
        The Collector has all the required information to determine that 
        the application is PPP, because the Application Tag uses a 
        global and well know registry, ie the IANA protocol number.  
        The 24 value is globally unique within Cisco Systems for 
        Classification Engine ID 12, so the Collector can determine 
        which application is represented by the Application Tag by 
        loading the registry out of band. 
      

     6.2. Example 2: Standardized IANA Layer 3 Protocol 

        From the list of Classification Engine IDs in Table 1, we can 
        see that the IANA layer 3 Classification Engine ID is 1: 
         
        IANA-       1      The IANA protocol (layer 3) number is 
         L3                exported in the Selector ID. 
                           See 
                           http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-
                           numbers.. 
      
        From the list of IANA layer 3 protocols (see [IANA-PROTO]), we 
        can see that ICMP has the value 1: 
                                         
        Decimal    Keyword    Protocol                    Reference 
        1          ICMP       Internet Control Message    [RFC792] 
         
        So in the case of the standardized IANA layer 3 protocol ICMP, 
        the Classification Engine ID is 1, and the Selector ID has the 
        value of 1.  
         
        Therefore the Application Tag is encoded as: 
      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011 [Page 18] 
                                         
     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

         
            0                   1            
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
           |       1       |       1       | 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         
        So the Application Tag has the value of 257. Instead of 
        representing the Application Tag in hexadecimal format, the 
        format '1...1' is used for simplicity in the examples below. 
         
        Flexible NetFlow creates a Template Record with a few 
        Information Elements: amongst other things, the Application Tag. 
        For example: 
         
        - sourceIPv4Address (key field) 
        - destinationIPv4Address (key field) 
        - ipDiffServCodePoint (key field) 
        - applicationTag (key field) 
        - octetTotalCount (non key field) 
         
        For example, a Flow Record corresponding to the above Template 
        Record may contain: 
         
            { sourceIPv4Address=1.1.1.1, destinationIPv4Address=2.2.2.2, 
              ipDiffServCodePoint=0, applicationTag='1...1', 
              octetTotalCount=123456 } 
         
        The Collector has all the required information to determine that 
        the application is ICMP, because the Application Tag uses a 
        global and well know registry, ie the IANA L3 protocol number.  
         
         
     6.3. Example 3: Cisco Systems Proprietary Layer 3 Protocol 

        Assume that Cisco Systems has specified a new layer 3 protocol 
        called "foo".  
         
        From the list of Classification Engine IDs in Table 1, we can 
        see that the Cisco Systems layer 3 Classification Engine ID is 
        2: 
         
        CANA-       2      Cisco Systems proprietary layer 3 
         L3                definition. Cisco Systems can still export 
                           its own layer 3 protocol numbers, while 
                           waiting for IANA to assign it. The 
      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011 [Page 19] 
                                         
     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

                           Selector ID has a global significance for 
                           all Cisco Systems devices under CANA 
                           governance. Hopefully the same IDs will be 
                           maintained after the IANA standardization.  
         
         
        A global registry within Cisco Systems specifies that the "foo" 
        protocol has the value 90: 
         
        Protocol    Protocol Id 
        foo         90 
         
        So in the case of Cisco Systems layer 3 protocol foo, the 
        Classification Engine ID is 2, and the Selector ID has the value 
        of 90. 
         
        Therefore the Application Tag is encoded as: 
         
            0                   1            
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
           |       2       |       90      | 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         
        So the Application Tag has the value of 602. Instead of 
        representing the Application Tag in hexadecimal format, the 
        format '2..90' is used for simplicity in the examples below. 
         
        Flexible NetFlow creates a Template Record with a few 
        Information Elements: amongst other things, the Application Tag. 
        For example: 
         
        - sourceIPv4Address (key field) 
        - destinationIPv4Address (key field) 
        - ipDiffServCodePoint (key field) 
        - applicationTag (key field) 
        - octetTotalCount (non key field) 
         
        For example, a Flow Record corresponding to the above Template 
        Record may contain: 
         
            { sourceIPv4Address=1.1.1.1, destinationIPv4Address=2.2.2.2, 
              ipDiffServCodePoint=0, applicationTag='2...90',

        Along with this Flow Record, a new Options Template Record would 
        be exported, as shown in Section 6.7.  
         
                                         
     6.4. Example 4: Standardized IANA Layer 4 Port 

        From the list of Classification Engine IDs in Table 1, we can 
        see that the IANA layer 4 Classification Engine ID is 3: 
         
        IANA-       3      IANA layer 4 well-known port number is 
         L4                exported in the selector ID. 
                           See http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-
                           numbers. 
                            
                           Note: as a flow is unidirectional, it 
                           contains the destination port in a flow 
                           from the client to the server.  
         
        From the list of IANA layer 4 ports (see [IANA-PORTS]), we can 
        see that SNMP has the value 161: 
         
        Keyword    Decimal    Description 
        snmp       161/tcp    SNMP 
        snmp       161/udp    SNMP 
         
        So in the case of the standardized IANA layer 4 SNMP port, the 
        Classification Engine ID is 3, and the Selector ID has the value 
        of 161. 
         
        Therefore the Application Tag is encoded as: 
         
            0                   1            
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
           |       3       |      161      | 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         
        Flexible NetFlow creates a Template Record with a few 
        Information Elements: amongst other things, the Application Tag. 
        For example: 
         
        - sourceIPv4Address (key field) 
        - destinationIPv4Address (key field) 
        - protocol (key field) 
      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011 [Page 21] 
                                         
     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

        - ipDiffServCodePoint (key field) 
        - applicationTag (key field) 
        - octetTotalCount (non key field) 
         
        For example, a Flow Record corresponding to the above Template 
        Record may contain: 
         
            { sourceIPv4Address=1.1.1.1, destinationIPv4Address=2.2.2.2, 
              protocol=17, ipDiffServCodePoint=0, 
              applicationTag='3..161', octetTotalCount=123456 } 
      
        The Collector has all the required information to determine that 
        the application is SNMP, because the Application Tag uses a 
        global and well know registry, ie the IANA L4 protocol number.  
      
                                         
     6.5. Example 4: Layer 7 Application 

        In this example, the Metering Process has observes some Citrix 
        traffic. 
         
        From the list of Classification Engine IDs in Table 1, we can 
        see that the L7 unique Engine ID is 13: 
         
         L7        13    The Selector ID represents the Cisco Systems 
                         unique global ID for the layer 7 
                         application. The Selector ID has a global 
                         significance for all Cisco Systems devices. 
         
        Suppose that the Metering Process returns the ID 10000 for 
        Citrix traffic. 
         
        So, in the case of this Citrix application, the Classification 
        Engine ID is 13 and the Selector ID has the value of 10000. 
         
        Therefore the Application Tag is encoded as: 
         
      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |      13       |                                               | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                             10000                             | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       
      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011 [Page 22] 
                                         
     Internet-Draft  <Export of App. Info. in IPFIX >      March 2011 
         

        So the Application Tag has the value of '13..10000'.  
         
        Note that the figure shows that the Exporting Process exports 
        the value 10000 in 7 bytes: this is pure speculation.  However, 
        it doesn't matter as the applicationTag would be exported in a 
        variable length Information Element. 
         
        Flexible NetFlow creates a Template Record with a few 
        Information Elements: amongst other things, the Application Tag. 
        For example: 
         
        - sourceIPv4Address (key field) 
        - destinationIPv4Address (key field) 
        - ipDiffServCodePoint (key field) 
        - applicationTag (key field) 
        - octetTotalCount (non key field) 
         
        For example, a Flow Record corresponding to the above Template 
        Record may contain: 
         
            { sourceIPv4Address=1.1.1.1, destinationIPv4Address=2.2.2.2, 
              ipDiffServCodePoint=0, applicationTag='13...10000', 
              octetTotalCount=123456 } 
         
        The 10000 value is globally unique within Cisco Systems, so the 
        Collector can determine which application is represented by the 
        Application Tag by loading the registry out of band. 
         
        Along with this Flow Record, a new Options Template Record would 
        be exported, as shown in Section 6.7.  
         
         
     6.6. Example: port Obfuscation 

        For example, a HTTP server might run a TCP port 23 (assigned to 
        telnet in [IANA-PORTS]). If the Metering Process is capable of 
        detecting HTTP in the same case, the Application Tag 
        representation must contain HTTP. However, if the reporting 
        application wants to determine whether or the default HTTP port 
        80 or 8080 was used, it must export the destination port 
        (destinationTransportPort at [IANA-IPFIX]) in the corresponding 
        NetFlow record.  
         
        In the case of a standardized IANA layer 4 port, the 
        Classification Engine ID is 2, and the Selector ID has the value 
        of 80 for HTTP (see [IANA-PORTS]). 
         
      
      
     <Claise, Aitken, Ben-Dvora>     Expires September 9 2011 [Page 23]

        Therefore the Application Tag is encoded as: 
         
            0                   1                   2                   
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
           |       3       |             80                | 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
         
        Flexible NetFlow creates a Template Record with a few 
        Information Elements: amongst other things, the Application Tag. 
        For example: 
         
        - sourceIPv4Address (key field) 
        - destinationIPv4Address (key field) 
        - protocol (key field) 
        - destinationTransportPort (key field) 
        - applicationTag (key field) 
        - octetTotalCount (non key field) 
         
        For example, a Flow Record corresponding to the above Template 
        Record may contain: 
         
            { sourceIPv4Address=1.1.1.1, destinationIPv4Address=2.2.2.2, 
              protocol=17, destinationTransportPort=23, 
              applicationTag='3..80', octetTotalCount=123456 } 
                     
        The Collector has all the required information to determine that 
        the application is HTTP, but runs on port 23. 
      

     6.7. Example: Application Mapping Options Template 

        Along with the Flow Records shown in the above examples, a new 
        Options Template Record would be exported to express the 
        Application Name and Application Description associated with 
        each Application Tag. 
         
        The Options Template Record contains the following Information 
        Elements: 
         
        1. Scope = applicationTag. 
         
               From RFC 5101: "The scope, which is only available in the 
               Options Template Set, gives the context of the reported 
               Information Elements in the Data Records." 
                
        2. applicationName.

        3. applicationDescription. 
         
         
        The Options Data Record associated with the examples above would 
        contain, for example: 
         
            { scope=applicationTag='2...90', 
              applicationName="foo", 
              applicationDescription="The Cisco foo protocol", 
         
              scope=applicationTag='13...10000', 
              applicationName="Citrix", 
              applicationDescription="A Citrix application" } 
         
        When combined with the example Flow Records above, these Options 
        Template Records tell the NetFlow collector: 
         
        1. A flow of 123456 bytes exists from sourceIPv4Address 1.1.1.1 
        to destinationIPv4address 2.2.2.2 with a DSCP value of 0 and an 
        applicationTag of '12...90', which maps to the "foo" 
        application. 
         
        2. A flow of 123456 bytes exists from sourceIPv4Address 1.1.1.1 
        to destinationIPv4address 2.2.2.2 with a DSCP value of 0 and an 
        Application Tag of '13...10000', which maps to the "Citrix" 
        application. 
         
     6.8. Example: Attributes Values Options Template Record 

        Along with the Flow Records shown in the above examples, a new 
        Options Template Record is exported to express the values of the 
        different attributes related to the Application Tags. 
         
        The Options Template Record would contain the following 
        Information Elements: 
         
          1. Scope = applicationTag. 
         
               From RFC 5101: "The scope, which is only available in the 
               Options Template Set, gives the context of the reported 
               Information Elements in the Data Records."

        The Options Data Record associated with the examples above would 
        contain, for example: 
         
            { scope=applicationTag='2...90', 
              applicationCategoryName="foo-category", 
              applicationSubCategoryName="foo-subcategory", 
              applicationGroupName="foo-group", 
              p2pTechnology=NO 
              tunnelTechnology=YES 
              encryptedTechnology=NO 
      
        When combined with the example Flow Records above, these Options 
        Template Records tell the NetFlow collector: 
         
        A flow of 123456 bytes exists from sourceIPv4Address 1.1.1.1 to 
        destinationIPv4address 2.2.2.2 with a DSCP value of 0 and an 
        applicationTag of '12...90', which maps to the "foo" 
        application.  This application can be characterized by the 
        relevant attributes values.

      Appendix A.  Additions to XML Specification of IPFIX Information 
      Elements 

        This appendix contains additions to the machine-readable 
        description of the IPFIX information model coded in XML in 
        Appendix A and Appendix B in [RFC5102].  Note that this appendix 
        is of informational nature, while the text in Section 7. 
        (generated from this appendix) is normative.

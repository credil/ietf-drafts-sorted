       - This draft is basically a starting point: multiple open issues 
          must be discussed throughout the draft 
       - What should we export in terms of Original Exporter? A 
          specific Options Template? 
       - Should we export the aggregation function for an IPFIX 
          Concentrator? 
       - Do we want to have an aggregate observation point? 
       - Review the problem statement, section 6 "IPFIX Mediators 
          Implementation Specific Problems" to see if we covered all 
          problems 
       - See the EDITOR'S NOTE within the document 
        
         
     1. Introduction 

        The IPFIX architectural components in [RFC5470] consist of 
        IPFIX Devices and IPFIX Collectors communicating using the 
        IPFIX protocol [RFC5101], which specifies how to export IP 
        Flow information.  This protocol is designed to export 
        information about IP traffic Flows and related measurement 
        data, where a Flow is defined by a set of key attributes 
        (e.g. source and destination IP address, source and 
        destination port, etc.).  
         
        The specifications in the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] have not 
        been defined in the context of an IPFIX Mediator 
        receiving/aggregating/correlating/anonymizing/etc... Flow 
        Records from the one or multiple Exporters.  Indeed, the 
        IPFIX protocol must be adapted for Intermediate Processes, as 
        defined in the IPFIX Mediation Reference Model (Figure A of 
        [IPFIX-MED-FMWK].   
          
         
     2. Terminology 

        The IPFIX-specific and PSAMP-specific terminology used in this 
        document is defined in [RFC5101] and [RFC5476], respectively.  
        The IPFIX Mediation-specific terminology used in this document 
        is defined in [IPFIX-MED-PS].  However, as reading the problem 
        statements document is not a prerequisite to reading this 
        framework document, the definitions have been reproduced here 
        along with additional definitions.  In this document, as in 
        [RFC5101] and [RFC5476], the first letter of each IPFIX-specific 
        and PSAMP-specific term is capitalized along with the IPFIX 
        Mediation-specific term defined here. 
         
        In this document, we use the generic term "record stream" to 
        denote a set of flow- or packet-based data records and their 
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 19, 2010            [Page 3] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    October 2009 
         

        additional information that flows from data sources, whether 
        encoded in IPFIX protocol or non-IPFIX protocols.  Regarding 
        IPFIX and PSAMP, we use the generic term "Data Records" for 
        IPFIX Flow Records, PSAMP Packet Reports, and Data Records 
        defined by Options Templates, unless an explicit distinction is 
        required. 
         
        Transport Session Information 
         
          The Transport Session is specified in [RFC5101].  In SCTP, the 
          Transport Session Information is the SCTP association.  In TCP 
          and UDP, the Transport Session Information corresponds to a 5-
          tuple {Exporter IP address, Collector IP address, Exporter 
          transport port, Collector transport port, transport protocol}. 
         
        Original Exporter 
         
          An Original Exporter is an IPFIX Device that hosts the  
          Observation Points where the metered IP packets are observed. 
         
        IPFIX Mediation 
         
          IPFIX Mediation is the manipulation and conversion of a record 
          stream for subsequent export using the IPFIX protocol. 
         
        The following terms are used in this document to describe the 
        architectural entities used by IPFIX Mediation. 
         
        Intermediate Process 
         
          An Intermediate Process takes a record stream as its input 
          from Collecting Processes, Metering Processes, IPFIX File 
          Readers, other Intermediate Processes, or other record 
          sources; performs some transformations on this stream, based 
          upon the content of each record, states maintained across 
          multiple records, or other data sources; and passes the 
          transformed record stream as its output to Exporting 
          Processes, IPFIX File Writers, or other Intermediate 
          Processes, in order to perform IPFIX Mediation. Typically, an 
          Intermediate Process is hosted by an IPFIX Mediator. 
          Alternatively, an Intermediate Process may be hosted by an 
          Original Exporter. 
         
        Specific Intermediate Processes are described below.  However, 
        this is not an exhaustive list. 
         
        Intermediate Conversion Process 
         
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 19, 2010            [Page 4] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    October 2009 
         

          An Intermediate Conversion Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that transforms non IPFIX into IPFIX, or manages the relation 
          among Templates and states of incoming/outgoing transport 
          sessions in the case of transport protocol conversion (e.g., 
          from UDP to SCTP). 
         
        Intermediate Aggregation Process 
         
          An Intermediate Aggregation Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that aggregates records based upon a set of Flow Keys or 
          functions applied to fields from the record (e.g., binning and 
          subnet aggregation). 
         
        Intermediate Correlation Process 
         
          An Intermediate Correlation Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that adds information to records, noting correlations among 
          them, or generates new records with correlated data from 
          multiple records (e.g., the production of bidirectional flow 
          records from unidirectional flow records). 
         
        Intermediate Selection Process 
         
          An Intermediate Selection Process is an Intermediate Process 
          that selects records from a sequence based upon criteria-
          evaluated record values and passes only those records that 
          match the criteria (e.g., filtering only records from a given 
          network to a given Collector). 
         
        Intermediate Anonymization Process 
         
          An Intermediate Anonymization Process is an Intermediate 
          Process that transforms records in order to anonymize them, to 
          protect the identity of the entities described by the records 
          (e.g., by applying prefix-preserving pseudonymization of IP 
          addresses). 
         
        IPFIX Mediator 
         
          An IPFIX Mediator is an IPFIX Device that provides IPFIX 
          Mediation by receiving a record stream from some data sources, 
          hosting one or more Intermediate Processes to transform that 
          stream, and exporting the transformed record stream into IPFIX 
          Messages via an Exporting Process.  In the common case, an 
          IPFIX Mediator receives a record stream from a Collecting 
          Process, but it could also receive a record stream from data 
          sources not encoded using IPFIX, e.g., in the case of 

      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 19, 2010            [Page 5] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    October 2009 
         

          conversion from the NetFlow V9 protocol [RFC3954] to IPFIX 
          protocol. 
         
        Specific types of IPFIX Mediators are defined below. 
         
        IPFIX Proxy 
         
          An IPFIX Proxy is an IPFIX Mediator that converts a record 
          stream for the purpose of protocol conversion. 
         
        IPFIX Concentrator 
         
          An IPFIX Concentrator is an IPFIX Mediator that receives a 
          record stream from one or more Exporters and performs 
          correlation, aggregation, and/or modification. 
         
        IPFIX Distributor 
         
          An IPFIX Distributor is an IPFIX Mediator that receives a 
          record stream from one or more Exporters and exports each 
          record to one or more Collectors, deciding to which 
          Collector(s) to export each record depending on the decision 
          of an Intermediate Process. 
         
        IPFIX Masquerading Proxy 
         
          An IPFIX Masquerading Proxy is an IPFIX Mediator that receives 
          a record stream from one or more Exporters to screen out parts 
          of records according to configured policies in order to 
          protect the privacy of the network's end users or to retain 
          sensitive data of the exporting organization. 
         
        The following is a summary table for specific IPFIX Mediator 
        types.  The abbreviation "IP" stands for Intermediate Process.

     2.1. IPFIX Documents Overview 

        The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators 
        with access to IP Flow information. 
         
        The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow 
        information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting 
        Process is defined in the IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470], per 
        the requirements defined in RFC 3917 [RFC3917]. 
         
        The IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470] specifies how IPFIX Data 
        Records and Templates are carried via a congestion-aware 
        transport protocol from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX 
        Collecting Processes. 
         
        IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, 
        their name, type and additional semantic information, as 
        specified in the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102].   
         
        The IPFIX Applicability Statement [RFC5472] describes what 
        type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they 
        can use the information provided.  It furthermore shows how 
        the IPFIX framework relates to other architectures and 
        frameworks.  
         
        "IPFIX Mediation: Problem Statement" [IPFIX-MED-PS], describing 
        the IPFIX Mediation applicability examples, along with some 
        problems that network administrators have been facing, is the 
        basis for the "IPFIX Mediation: Framework" [IPFIX-MED-FMWK].  
        This framework details the IPFIX Mediation reference model and 
        the components of an IPFIX Mediator. 
         
      
         
     2.2. Relationship with IPFIX and PSAMP 

        The specification in this document applies to the IPFIX 
        protocol specifications [RFC5101].  All specifications from 
        [RFC5101] apply unless specified otherwise in this document. 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 19, 2010            [Page 7] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    October 2009 
         

        As the Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol specifications 
        [RFC5476] are based on the IPFIX protocol specifications, the 
        specifications in this document are also valid for the PSAMP 
        protocol.  Therefore, the method specified by this document 
        also applies to PSAMP. 
      
     3. Specifications 

        This section describes the IPFIX specifications for Mediation.  
        These new specifications, which are more specific compared to 
        [RFC5101], are described with the key words described in 
        [RFC2119]. 
         
     3.1. Encoding of IPFIX Message Header 

        The format of the IPFIX Message Header is shown in Figure A.

        Export Time 

                Time in seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1st 1970, at which 
                the IPFIX Message Header leaves the IPFIX Mediator. 

        Sequence Number 

                Incremental sequence counter modulo 2^32 of all IPFIX 
                Data Records sent on this PR-SCTP stream from the 
                current Observation Domain by the Exporting Process.  
                Check the specific meaning of this field in the sub-
                sections of section 10 when UDP or TCP is selected as 
                the transport protocol.  This value SHOULD be used by 
                the Collecting Process to identify whether any IPFIX 
                Data Records have been missed.  Template and Options 
                Template Records do not increase the Sequence Number. 
                 
        Observation Domain ID 

                A 32-bit identifier of the Observation Domain that is 
                locally unique to the Exporting Process.  The Exporting 
                Process uses the Observation Domain ID to uniquely 
                identify to the Collecting Process the Observation 
                Domain that metered the Flows.  It is RECOMMENDED that 
                this identifier is also unique per IPFIX Device.  
                Collecting Processes SHOULD use the Transport Session 
                and the Observation Domain ID field to separate 
                different export streams originating from the same 
                Exporting Process.  The Observation Domain ID SHOULD be 
                0 when no specific Observation Domain ID is relevant for 
                the entire IPFIX Message.  For example, when exporting 
                the Exporting Process Statistics, or in case of 
                hierarchy of Collector when aggregated data records are 
                exported. 
                 
                EDITOR'S NOTE: make the link with section 3.4.1.   
      

     3.2. Template Management 

     3.2.1. Template Management Without Template Record Change 

        The first case is a situation where the IPFIX Mediator, 
        typically an IPFIX Distributor, relays an (Options) Template 
        without changing its content.  
         
        As in [RFC5101], the Template IDs are unique per Exporter, per 
        Transport Session, and per Observation Domain.  As there is no 
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 19, 2010            [Page 9] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    October 2009 
         

        guarantee that, for similar Template Records, the Template IDs 
        received on the incoming Transport Session and exported to the 
        outgoing Transport Session would be same, the IPFIX Mediator 
        MUST maintain a mapping database between received and exported 
        (Options) Template Records: 
       - for each Received (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
          Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Original Exporter, 
          Observation Domain, and Transport Session 
       - for each Exported (Options) Template Record: Template Record 
          Flow Keys and non Flow Keys, Template ID, Collector, 
          Observation Domain, and Transport Session 
         
        If an IPFIX Mediator receives an IPFIX Withdrawal Message for a 
        (Options) Template Record that is not used anymore in any 
        outgoing Transport Sessions, the IPFIX Mediator SHOULD send the 
        appropriate IPFIX Withdrawal Message(s) on the outgoing 
        Transport Session, and remove the corresponding entry in its 
        mapping database. 
        
        If an incoming Transport Session is gracefully shutdown or 
        reset, the (Options) Template Records corresponding to that 
        Transport Session MUST be removed from the mapping database.  
         
        If a (Options) Template Record is not used anymore in outgoing 
        Transport Session, it MUST be withdrawn with an IPFIX Withdrawal 
        Message on that specific outgoing Transport Session.  
      
      
     3.2.2. Template Management With Template Record Change 

        The second case is a situation where the IPFIX Mediator, 
        typically an IPFIX Concentrator or an IPFIX Masquerading Proxy, 
        generates new (Options) Template compared to what it receives 
        from the Original Exporters. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: to be completed. This is slightly more complex as 
        we have to introduce the notion of derived (Options) Template 
        Records. 

         
     3.3. Time Management 

        The IPFIX Message Header "Export Time" field is the time in 
        seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1, 1970, at which the IPFIX Message 
        Header leaves the Mediator.   
         


      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 19, 2010           [Page 10] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    October 2009 
         

        It is RECOMMENDED that Mediators handle time using absolute 
        timestamps (e.g. flowStartSeconds, flowStartMilliseconds, 
        flowStartNanoseconds), which are specified relative to the UNIX 
        epoch (00:00 UTC 1 Jan 1970), where possible, rather than 
        relative timestamps (e.g. flowStartSysUpTime, 
        flowStartDeltaMicroseconds), which are specified relative to 
        protocol structures such as system initialization or message 
        export time.   
         
        The latter are difficult to manage for two reasons.  First, they 
        require constant translation, as the system initialization time 
        of an intermediate system and the export time of an intermediate 
        message will change across mediation operations.  Further, 
        relative timestamps introduce range problems.   
         
        For example, when using the flowStartDeltaMicroseconds and 
        flowEndDeltaMicroseconds Information Elements [RFC5102], the 
        Data Record must be exported within a maximum of 71 minutes 
        after its creation.  Otherwise, the 32-bit counter would not be 
        sufficient to contain the flow start time offset.  Those time 
        constraints might be incompatible with some of the Intermediate 
        Processes: Intermediate Aggregation Process (temporal) and 
        Intermediate Correlation Process, for example. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: when an IPFIX Concentrator aggregates information 
        from different Flow Records, what should be the time reported?  
         
         
     3.4. Observation Point Management 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: Do we want to aggregate the observation points? 
        EDITOR'S NOTE: Do we want to export the 
        originalExporterIPaddress? Do we want a series of new IEs for 
        that? 
         

     3.4.1. Observation Domain Management 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: to be discussed 
         
        Solution 1: if we observe from different ODs, then the new OD 
        must always be 0. 
        Solution 2: if we observe from different ODs, the MD must 
        compute a new OD id, unique to the MD 
        Solution 3: if we observe from different ODs, then the new OD 
        must always be 0 and a new Options Template must contain the 
        list of OD. 

      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 19, 2010           [Page 11] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    October 2009 
         

        Solution 4: we always introduce the Original Exporter ID so that 
        the (Original Exporter, Original OD) pair is unique 
         
        Solution 5: If we observe from different ODs, ODs are preserved 
        when 1) data records are not moved to different messages and 2) 
        ODs don't collide. In case 2, ODs are mapped by the mediator. 
        Mediators should attempt the minimum possible OD mapping. Keep 
        in mind ODs are a protocol-specific identifier meant to keep 
        templates and scopes from colliding, NOT to export any actual 
        information about the collection infrastructure. A first pass at 
        text for this alternative appears below. 
         
        A Mediator SHOULD attempt to preserve the Observation Domain IDs 
        of incoming messages when processing IPFIX data on a per IPFIX 
        Message basis in order to preserve the scope of mediated 
        (Options) Templates.  When information comes to a IPFIX Mediator 
        from two separate Exporting Processes bearing the same 
        Observation Domain ID, the Mediator SHOULD assign a new 
        Observation Domain ID for one of the Observation Domains. 
        Keeping Observation Domains separate ensures that re-exported 
        Templates and Options will not collide without requiring 
        rewriting. 
         
        When mixing Data Records from multiple Messages received from 
        multiple Observation Domains, or generating new Data Records 
        from the result of some intermediate function on Data Records 
        from multiple IPFIX Messages received from multiple Observation 
        Domains, a Mediator SHOULD assign a new Observation Domain ID 
        for the exported IPFIX Messages.  This is consistent with the 
        preservation guideline above, as in most if not all such 
        circumstances, the IPFIX Mediator will be generating new 
        Templates itself as a consequence of the mediation being 
        performed. 
         
         

     3.5. Specific Reporting Requirements 

        Some specific Options Templates and Options Template Records are 
        necessary to provide extra information about the Flow Records 
        and about the Metering Process. 
         
        The Option Template and Options Template Records defined in 
        these subsections, which impose some constraints on the Metering 
        Process and Exporting Process implementations, MAY be 
        implemented.  If implemented, the specific Option Templates 
        SHOULD be implemented as specified in these subsections. 
         
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 19, 2010           [Page 12] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    October 2009 
         

        The minimum set of Information Elements is always specified in 
        these Specific IPFIX Options Templates.  Nevertheless, extra 
        Information Elements may be used in these specific Options 
        Templates. 
         

     3.5.1. The Flow Keys Options Template 

        Exactly like the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101], the Flow Keys Option 
        Template specifies the structure of a Data Record for reporting 
        the Flow Keys of reported Flows.  A Flow Keys Data Record 
        extends a particular Template Record that is referenced by its 
        templateId identifier.  The Template Record is extended by 
        specifying which of the Information Elements contained in the 
        corresponding Data Records describe Flow properties that serve 
        as Flow Keys of the reported Flow. 
        The Flow Keys Option Template SHOULD contain the following 
        Information Elements that are defined in [RFC5102] 
           templateId              An identifier of a Template.  This 
                                   Information Element MUST be defined  
                                   as a Scope Field. 
         
           flowKeyIndicator        Bitmap with the positions of the Flow  
                                   Keys in the Data Records. 
        When any Intermediate Process changes the Flow Keys, the Flow 
        Keys Option Template MUST include the new set of Flow Keys. 
        Typically, an Intermediate Aggregation Process reduces the 
        number of Flow Keys 
         
     3.5.2. IPFIX Protocol Options Template 

        The "Metering Process Statistics Options Template", "The 
        Metering Process Reliability Statistics Options Template", and 
        "The Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Options Template", 
        as specified in [RFC5101], SHOULD be implemented on the IFPIX 
        Mediator. 
         
     3.5.3. IPFIX Mediator Options Template 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: we don't think we need a specific Options 
        Template for the IPFIX Mediator; instead, each mediation 
        function which has some useful metadata (for example, [IPFIX-
        ANON] should define its own Options Template Record(s). They 
        should simply all look like each others. 
         
        For example, a specification of IPFIX flow anonymisation 
        including an Options Template for the export of metadata about 
        anonymised flows is described in [IPFIX-ANON]; when anonymising 
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 19, 2010           [Page 13] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    October 2009 
         

        Flows Records, IPFIX Mediators SHOULD add the Options Template 
        specified therein to annotate the exported data.        
         
         
     3.6. Transport Session Management 

        We should be allowing the three transport protocols, i.e. UDP, 
        TCP, SCTP [RFC4960] [RFC3758], as input with the caveats that go 
        along with each transport protocol (i.e., never use UDP unless 
        on a dedicated network...) 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: to be completed 

         

     3.7. The Collecting Process's Side 

        If we change something on the protocol, the Collecting Process 
        must be able to support it. 
        For example, if we impose that the new O.P. is a structured data 
        composed of different remote O.P., then the C.P. must support 
        structured data. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: to be completed 
         
         
     3.8. Sampling Management 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: What about the accuracy of aggregated Flow 
        Records with the sampling rates? With different sampling rates? 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: similarly, shouldn't this section be handled in 
        the adopted -sampling draft?  
        Potentially. Maybe but we could write a sentence such: 
        "if the Mediation aggregates flow records with sampling rate, 
        the new sampling rate must be calculated" 
        Or maybe 
        "the Mediation can't aggregate flow records with different 
        sampling rate" 
        Or... 
         
         
     3.9. Filtering Management 

        QUESTION: What should we do in terms of filtering? Should we try 
        to export the filtering function?

     4. New Intermediate Function 

        How should new intermediate functions be plugged into this 
        protocol? OR maybe this is a framework question? 
         
           
     5. Security Considerations 

        The same security considerations as for the IPFIX Protocol 
        [RFC5101] apply. 
                
         
     6. IANA Considerations 

        EDITOR'S NOTE: to be updated with any Mediation's specific new 
        Information Elements.

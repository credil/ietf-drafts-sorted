Abstract

   This document describes DHCPv6 Route Options for provisioning IPv6
   routes on nodes with DHCPv6 clients.  This is expected to improve the
   ability of an operator to configure and influence a node's ability to
   pick an appropriate route to a destination when this node is multi-
   homed and where other means of route configuration may be
   impractical.

Internet-Draft             DHCPv6 Route Option            September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Neighbor Discovery (ICMPv6) protocol [RFC4861] provides a
   mechanism for hosts to discover one or more default routers on a
   directly connected network segment.  Extensions to the protocol
   defined in [RFC4191] allow hosts to discover the preferences for
   multiple default routers on a given link, as well as any specific
   routes advertised by these routers.  This allows network
   administrators to better handle multi-homed host topologies and
   influence the route selection by the host.  This ND based mechanism
   however is sub optimal or impractical in some multi-homing scenarios,
   where DHCPv6 is seen to be more viable.

   This draft defines the DHCPv6 Route Option for provisioning IPv6
   routes on DHCPv6 clients.  The proposed option is primarily envisaged
   for use by DHCPv6 client nodes that are capable of making basic IP
   routing decisions and maintaining an IPv6 routing table, broadly in
   line with the capabilities of a generic host as described in
   [RFC4191].

   Throughout the document the words node and client are used as a
   reference to the device with such routing capabilities, hosting the
   DHCPv6 client software.  The route information is taken to be
   equivalent to static routing, and limited in the number of required
   routes to a handful.


2.  Problem overview

   The following scenario is used to illustrate the problem as found in
   multi-homed residential access networks.  It is duly noted that the
   problem is not specific to IPv6, occurring also with IPv4, where it
   is today solved by means of DHCPv4 classless route information option
   [RFC3442], or alternative configuration mechanisms.

   In multi-homed networks, a given user's node may be connected to more
   than one gateways.  Such connectivity may be realized by means of
   dedicated physical or logical links that may also be shared with
   other users nodes.  In such multi-homed networks it is quite common
   for the network operator to offer the delivery of a particular type
   of IP service via a particular gateway, where the service can be
   characterised by means of specific destination IP network prefixes.
   Thus, from an IP routing perspective in order for the user node to
   select the appropriate gateway for a given destination IP prefix,
   recourse needs to be made to classic longest destination match IP
   routing, with the node acquiring such prefixes into its routing
   table.  This is typically the remit of dynamic Internal Gateway
   Protocols (IGPs), which however are rarely used by operators in

   residential access networks.  This is primarily due to operational
   costs and a desire to contain the complexity of user nodes and IP
   Edge devices to a minimum.  While, IP Route configuration may be
   achieved using the ICMPv6 extensions defined in [RFC4191], this
   mechanism does not lend itself to other operational constraints such
   as the desire to control the route information on a per node basis,
   the ability to determine whether a given node is actually capable of
   receiveing/processing such route information.  A preferred mechanism,
   and one that additionally also lends itself to centralized management
   independent of the management of the gateways, is that of using the
   DHCP protocol for conveying route information to the nodes.


3.  DHCPv6 Based Solution

   A DHCPv6 based solution allows an operator an on demand and node
   specific means of configuring static routing information.  Such a
   solution also fits into network environments where the operator
   prefers to manage RG configuration information from a centralized
   DHCP server.  [I-D.troan-multihoming-without-nat66] provides
   additional background to the need for a DHCPv6 solution to the
   problem.

   In terms of the high level operation of the solution defined in this
   draft, a DHCPv6 client interested in obtaining routing information
   request the route option using the DHCPv6 Option Request Option (ORO)
   sent to a server.  A Server, when configured to do so, provides the
   requested route information as part of a nested options structure
   covering; the next-hop address; the destination prefix; the route
   metric; any additional options applicable to the destination or next-
   hop.  The overall DHCPv6 design follow a similar approach to that
   used in the design of the IA_NA, IA_TA and IA_PD options in [RFC3633]


4.  DHCPv6 Route Option

   A DHCPv6 client interested in obtaining routing information includes
   the OPTION_IA_RT in its DHCPv6 Option Request Option (ORO) sent to a
   server.  A Server, when configured to do so, provides the requested
   route information using the OPTION_IA_RT option.  So as to allow the
   route option to be both extensible, as well as conveying detailed
   info for routes, use is made of a nested options structure.  An IA_RT
   conveys one or more OPTION_NEXT_HOP options that specify the IPv6
   next hop addresses.  Each OPTION_NEXT_HOP conveys in turn one or more
   OPTION_RT_PREFIX options that represents the IPv6 destination
   prefixes reachable via the given next hop.  The Formats of the
   OPTION_IA_RT, OPTION_NEXT_HOP and OPTION_RT_PREFIX are defined in the
   following sub-sections

Internet-Draft             DHCPv6 Route Option            September 2010


   The DHCPv6 Route Option format borrows from the principles of the
   Route Information Option defined in [RFC4191].  One notable exception
   with respect to [RFC4191] is however that a Route Lifetime element is
   not defined.  The information conveyed by the DHCPv6 Route Option is
   considered valid until changed or refreshed by general events that
   trigger DHCPv6 or route table state changes on a node, thus not
   requiring a specific route lifetime.  In the event that it is desired
   for the client to request a refresh of the route information (and
   other stateless DHCPv6 options), use of the generic DHCPv6
   Information Refresh Time Option, as specified in [RFC4242] is
   envisaged.

4.1.  DHCPv6 Route Option Format

   To separate routing information from other options conveyed in a
   DHCPv6 message, the DHCPv6 Route Option is defined and is used to
   convey to a client one or more IPv6 routes.  Each IPv6 route consists
   of an IPv6 next hop address, an IPv6 destination prefix (a.k.a.  The
   destination subnet), and a host preference value for the route.
   Elements of such route (e.g.  Next hops and prefixes associated with
   them) are conveyed in IA_RT's options, rather than in the IA_RT
   option itself.

   Discussion: Traditionally, grouping options (IA_NA, IA_TA and IA_RD)
   contain an identifier field (IAID) that must be unique among

   identifiers generated by one client.  It is used to differentiate
   between several options of the same type (e.g. several IA_NA options)
   that may be used simultaneously.  However, it is assumed that client
   will never use more than one IA_RT option therefore such an
   identifier is not needed.

4.2.  Next Hop Option Format

   The Next Hop Option defines the IPv6 address of the next hop, usually
   corresponding to a specific next-hop router.  For each next hop
   address there are one or more prefixes reachable via that next hop.

4.3.  Route Prefix Option Format

   The Route Prefix Option is used to convey information about a single
   prefix that represents the destination network.  The Route Prefix
   Option is used as a sub-option in the previously defined Next Hop
   Option.

             indicates whether to prefer the next hop associated with
             this prefix over others, when multiple identical prefixes

5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   When configured to do so s DHCPv6 server shall provide the Routes
   Option in ADVERTISE and REPLY messages sent to a client that
   requested the route option.  Each Next Hop Option sent by the server
   must convey at least one Route Prefix Option.

   Servers SHOULD NOT send Route Option to clients that did not
   explicitly requested it, using the ORO.

Internet-Draft             DHCPv6 Route Option            September 2010


   Servers MUST NOT send Route Option in messages other than ADVERTISE
   or REPLY.

   Servers MAY also include Status Code Option, defined in Section 22.13
   of the [RFC3315] to indicate the status of the operation.

   Servers MUST include the Status Code Option, if the requested routing
   configuration was not successful and SHOULD use status codes as
   defined in [RFC3315] and [RFC3633].

   Discussion: How should server indicate that there are no specific
   routes for this particular client?  The reasonable behavior is to
   return empty IA_RT option, possibly with Status Code indicating
   Success.  Another approach could be to simply not return any IA_RT
   option.


6.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   A DHCPv6 client compliant with this specification MUST request the
   Route Option (option value TBD) in an Option Request Option (ORO) in
   the following messages: Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-
   Request or Reconfigure.  The messages are to be sent as and when
   specified by [RFC3315].

   When processing a received Route Option a client MUST substitute a
   received 0::0 value in the Next Hop Option with the source IPv6
   address of the received DHCPv6 message.  It MUST also associate a
   received Link Local next hop addresses with the interface on which
   the client received the DHCPv6 message containing the route option.
   Such a substitution and/or association is useful in cases where the
   DHCPv6 server operator does not directly know the IPv6 next-hop
   address, other than knowing it is that of a DHCPv6 relay agent on the
   client LAN segment.  DHCPv6 Packets relayed to the client are sourced
   by the relay using this relay's IPv6 address, which could be a link
   local address.

   The Client MAY refresh assigned route information periodically.  The
   generic DHCPv6 Information Refresh Time Option, as specified in
   [RFC4242], can be used when it is desired for the client to
   periodically refresh of route information.

   The routes conveyed by the Route Option should be considered as
   complimentary to any other static route learning and maintenance
   mechanism used by, or on the client with one modification: The client
   MUST flush DHCPv6 installed routes following a link flap event on the
   DHCPv6 client interface over which the routes were installed.  This
   requirement is necessary to automate the flushing of routes for

   clients that may move to a different network.


7.  IANA Considerations

   A DHCPv6 option number of TBD for the introduced Route Option.  IANA
   is requested to allocate three DHCPv6 option codes referencing this
   document: OPTION_IA_RT, OPTION_NEXT_HOP and OPTION_RT_PREFIX.


8.  Security Considerations

   The overall security considerations discussed in [RFC3315] apply also
   to this document.  The Route option could be used by malicious
   parties to misdirect traffic sent by the client either as part of a
   denial of service or man-in-the-middle attack.  An alternative denial
   of service attack could also be realized by means of using the route
   option to overflowing any known memory limitations of the client, or
   to exceed the client's ability to handle the number of next hop
   addresses.

   Neither of the above considerations are new and specific to the
   proposed route option.  The mechanisms identified for securing DHCPv6
   as well as reasonable checks performed by client implementations are
   deemed sufficient in addressing these problems.

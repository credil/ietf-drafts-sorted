Internet-Draft              HIP Mobile Proxy                 August 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) [RFC5201] has been designed to allow
   hosts to preserve existing security associations and higher-layer
   protocol sessions by defining host mobility and multihoming
   mechanisms [RFC5206].  Specifically, a mobile or multihomed host that
   changes its IP address, or acquires new addresses, can securely
   notify its corresponding peers of the new address(es).  Similarly, a
   mobile HIP-aware host can update information about its current IP
   address(es) by updating records in HIP Rendezvous Servers [RFC5204]
   or other name services.

   This draft describes HIP protocol extensions that allow a non-HIP
   host to use the services of a HIP-aware proxy node and have
   capabilities to communicate with a HIP host and to be mobile when
   moving together with the HIP-proxy node.  The HIP-proxy node
   functions as a middle node that will encapsulate and decapsulate the
   packets that are destined to a HIP host or to a non-HIP host behind
   another HIP-proxy.  The HIP-proxy will handle all the HIP signaling
   on behalf of the non-HIP host and thus no modifications are required
   to the connection end-points.

   The HIP-proxy node MUST reside on the normal routing path of the
   packets.  HIP-proxy will capture and encapsulate/decapsulate packets
   coming from or going to non-HIP host.  The encapsulation procedure
   will also apply encryption as specified by the HIP association that
   is created during the HIP base exchange.  HIP-proxy node MAY also be
   aided by the DNS resolver in order to resolve the destination host's
   host identity.  While the HIP-proxy resides on the routing path of
   the non-HIP host's outgoing traffic, it MAY also function as a DNS
   proxy in which case all the DNS queries will pass through it.

2.  HIP-Proxy Architecture

   This section describes the extensions for the basic HIP [RFC5201]
   that are required to support proxying of the traffic.

2.1.  Assigning Host Identity to non-HIP host

   The HIP-proxy MAY generate a Host Identity for each legacy host it
   will represent in the network.  In this case, the HI is bound to a
   certain IP address.  The HIP-proxy will create point-to-point tunnel
   between the HIP-proxy and HIP end host.  The generation of each new
   Host identity MAY be triggered by DHCP or it MAY be generated
   manually before hand.

   Alternatively, the HIP-proxy MAY generate a Host Identity for a group
   of network hosts.  In this case, the HI is bound to a certain network
   prefix.  The HIP-proxy will create point-to-multi-point tunnel
   between the HIP-proxy and HIP end-host.

   The difference on whether the to create a single host identity to
   represent multiple hosts or whether to create a one identity per IP
   address is a trade-off between the whether the HIP-proxy needs to
   carry the IP header between the HIP-proxy and the HIP-node or not.

2.2.  Registering Host Identity IP address mapping to RVS

   HIP-proxy MAY register the non-HIP aware host's IP address in to
   rendezvous server for HIP hosts or proxies using the same rendezvous
   system.  The HIP host creates a opportunistic I1 packet (destination
   HIT null) and includes the IP address of the non-HIP aware host as a
   parameter to the I1 packet.  HIP host's I1-packet is forwarded via
   rendezvous system to the non-HIP host's proxy using the IP address of
   the non-HIP host.  When the I1 packet reaches the HIP-proxy that
   registered the address that HIP-proxy will respond to the I1 packet
   with R1 including the non-HIP aware host's IP address as a parameter
   and the HI that represents non-HIP aware host.

   The rendezvous system SHOULD verify that the HIP-proxy is authorized
   to add the mapping between non HIP IP address and HI before accepting
   the registration of the mapping.  Rendezvous system SHOULD NOT add
   any HI non-HIP IP mappings that it cannot verify to belong to that
   HIP-proxy as this might cause unwanted behavior in the routing
   system.

2.3.  Registering Host Identity to DNS

   The HIP-proxy MAY register the Host Identity (HI) resource record in
   to the DNS as defined in the [RFC5205].  The HIP-proxy will associate

   the HI with the FQDN of the non-HIP host.  When the HI is resolved
   from the DNS the resolving host will get the HI and address of the
   host or HI and address of the rendezvous server of the HIP-proxy
   depending on the local configuration policy.

3.  Parameters and packet formats

   In this section we define the additional HIP parameters needed to
   carry the non-HIP host information between the two proxies or proxy
   or HIP node.

3.1.  Proxy information parameter

   The Proxy Information (PINFO) parameter is used to carry the IPv4 or
   IPv6 address the non-HIP node is using.  Thus, the parameter will
   have different type value depending on whether the parameter is
   carrying the information of the initiator proxy's network or
   information of the responder HIP-proxy's network.

4.  Packet processing

4.1.  Opportunistic I1

4.1.1.  Rendezvous node

   The rendezvous node parses the PINFO_RESPONDER parameter and searches
   all the registered HIP-proxy client contexts through for an prefix
   that was in the received PINFO_RESPONDER parameter.

4.1.2.  HIP-proxy or HIP-node

   The responder verifies the I1 as specified in the [RFC5201].  As a
   additional step the responder MUST verify that the prefix included in
   to the PINFO_RESPONDER parameter of I1 packet contains a prefix that
   belongs some Host Identity which the host owns

4.2.  I1

   The responder verifies the I1 as specified in the [RFC5201].  As a
   additional step the responder MAY verify that the prefix included in
   to the PINFO_RESPONDER parameter of I1 packet contains a prefix that
   belongs to the host identity represented by the destination HIT field
   in the HIP protocol header.

4.3.  R1

   The initiator verifies the R1 as specified in the [RFC5201].  As a
   additional step the initiator MUST verify that the prefix included in
   to the PINFO_RESPONDER parameter of R1 packet contains a prefix that
   it sent out in the PINFO of the I1 packet.

   The initiator SHOULD first try to find the right HIP association
   using the responders HIT or HI.  If previous check returns empty HIP
   association, then the initiator SHOULD check if it has sent any
   opportunistic I1s and if any of those contains a matching prefix to
   the prefix in PINFO_RESPONDER parameter in received R1 packet.

   After parsing and verification of the R1 packet the initiator will
   add mapping between the HI and the prefix provided by the
   PINFO_RESPONDER in to the HIP association context.

4.4.  I2

   The responder verifies the I2 as specified in the [RFC5201].  As a
   additional step the responder MUST parse the prefix included in to
   the PINFO_INITIATOR parameter of I2 packet and add a mapping between
   the HI and prefix in to the HIP association context.

Internet-Draft              HIP Mobile Proxy                 August 2009


4.5.  R2

   The initiator verifies the R2 as specified in the [RFC5201].  No
   additional information is included in to the R2 message.

4.6.  Data packets

4.6.1.  Sending data over ESP SA

   When receiving data packets from non-HIP node that are destined to a
   host that is either HIP or another HIP-proxy node the HIP-proxy will
   capture the packet and remove the IP header and send it through the
   ESP SA.

4.6.2.  Receiving data over ESP SA

   When receiving data packets from ESP SA the HIP or HIP-proxy node
   will reconstruct the original IP header and send it back to IP stack
   for further processing.

5.  Security Considerations

   Address theft by registering a invalid non-HIP IP address HI mapping.
   The Rendezvous node should verify that the IP address claimed by the
   HIP-proxy is really residing behind HIP-proxy.

                      Simultaneous Media Grouping
            draft-johansson-mmusic-grouping-simultaneous-01

Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to the grouping framework
   [RFC5888].  The extension identifies media descriptions that contain
   different representations of identical content.  An example of this
   is an endpoint that sends both a high-resolution and a low-resolution
   video sequence to a conferencing server.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft         Simultaneous Media Grouping              Oct 2010


1.  Definitions

   This document uses the following acronyms and definitions frequently:

      MCU : Multipoint Control Unit

      SID : Simultaneous (stream) Identity


2.  Introduction

   Advanced multipoint teleconferencing solutions often makes use of an
   MCU to determine which video should be transmitted to the users.  In
   order to avoid transcoding in the MCU it is popular to encode at
   least two versions of the same media in each endpoint.  One example
   is a main video stream with high resolution and one secondary stream
   with low resolution.  The MCU can then decide to distribute the high
   resolution stream of the active talker to the other participants.
   Optionally, the MCU may choose to distribute the lower resolution
   stream to receivers that do not have sufficient capability to receive
   the high resolution stream of the active talker.  Another optional
   use of low resolution streams is to distribute non-active talkers
   media, in addition to a high resolution version of the active talker.

   Draft [RFC5888] updates the basic grouping mechanism.  It defines the
   LS and FID semantics tags, LS is used for lip synchronization and FID
   for flow identification.  It would be tempting to use the FID tag for
   the above purpose, this is however explicitly forbidden in [RFC5888].

   The SDP Content Attribute [RFC4796] would be another grouping
   technique candidate, but the currently defined semantics of values
   "main" and "alt" is not a good match to the scope of this draft.

   For this reason a new semantics-extension token SID is defined as
   extension to [RFC5888].


3.  Description

   The token SID is defined as semantics-extension to [RFC5888].  This
   token identifies media descriptors that carry the same media encoded
   with different bitrates or codecs.

3.1.  Preference

   In this use the identification-tags (defined in [RFC5888]) indicate
   the preference for the media carried by the media descriptors in such
   a way that a lower number has preference over a higher number.  This

   way it becomes natural for a receiver to know which media is most
   preferred (or has the highest quality), even if that information
   could be extracted from other SDP attributes and (possibly codec
   specific) parameters.

3.2.  Example

   An SDP simple example to highlight the use for the new token.

      a=group: SID 1 2 3
      m=video 52738 RTP/AVP 99
      i=Large size 1280x720 send-only video
      a=mid:1
      a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000
      a=fmtp:99 profile-level-id=4DC01F; \
         sprop-parameter-sets= Z0LAH5ZkAoAt0IAAAAMAgAAAHkeMGVA=,aM48gA==
      b=AS:1000
      a=sendonly
      m=video 52740 RTP/AVP 100
      i=Medium size 640x360 send-only video
      a=mid:2
      a=rtpmap:100 H264/90000
      a=fmtp:100 profile-level-id=4DC016; \
         sprop-parameter-sets= Z0LAHpZkBQF/ywgAAAMACAAAAwHkeLF1,aM48gA==
      b=AS:350
      a=sendonly
      m=video 52742 RTP/AVP 101
      i=Small size 256x144 send-only video
      a=mid:3
      a=rtpmap:101 H264/90000
      a=fmtp:101 profile-level-id=42C00B; \
         sprop-parameter-sets= Z0LADJZkCAnQgAAAAwCAAAAeR4oVUA==,aM48gA==
      b=AS:128
      a=sendonly


   Three streams are offered (sendonly), each stream is a representation
   of a common recording (for instance a camera in a conference room).
   To indicate for the end user that the three streams carry identical
   media the new token 'SID' is used.


4.  IANA Considerations

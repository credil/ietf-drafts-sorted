1. Introduction 

   Service Providers have been leveraging IP multicast to provide 
   revenue-generating services, such as IP television (IPTV), video 
   conferencing, as well as the distribution of stock quotes or news. 
   These services are usually loss-sensitive or delay-sensitive, and 
   their data packets need to be delivered over a large scale IP

   network in real-time. Providing monitoring support for multicast is 
   important for building robust multicast services. 

   This draft introduces a new type of PIM Join Attribute which carries 
   measurement configuration TLVs, which are used for multicast 
   performance monitoring. It is based on [RFC5384], and specifies 
   additional procedures to process the Multicast Performance 
   Monitoring Configuration (M-PMC) attribute to implement automatic 
   performance monitoring configuration on multicast forwarding tree. 

    

2. Use of M-PMC Join Attribute 

2.1. Overview 

   This draft introduces a Multicast Performance Monitoring 
   Configuration (M-PMC) Join Attribute used for multicast performance 
   monitoring configuration. When network management personnel want to 
   initiate a measurement session for a certain multicast group on a 
   certain multicast forwarding path, e.g. a packet loss measurement, 
   he could initiate the configuration on the leaf router through 
   Command Line Interface or network management protocol and other 
   control protocol. Configuration TLVs for different measurement 
   entities will be included in the M-PMC attribute by the leaf router, 
   and sent hop-by-hop towards the upstream router and the root (either 
   the source or RP router) along the multicast tree. When upstream 
   router receives the Join message, it will examine the attribute and 
   determine which Configuration TLV to apply. It may also either pass 
   the attribute upwards as is or remove some of the TLVs from the 
   attribute, or even remove the whole attribute from the Join message 
   and not passing further upwards. Section 2.2 to 2.5 specifies the 
   procedures to process the M-PMC attribute when sending and receiving 
   Join message, and to resolve the configuration conflict and failure. 

   Figure 1 illustrates a small multicast tree to be monitored; three 
   functional entities are defined for performance monitoring [Y.1731]: 
   MEP_I (Maintenance Entity Group End Point Ingress), MIP (Maintenance 
   Entity Group Intermediate Point) and MEP-E (Maintenance Entity Group 
   End Point Egress). They are logical entities that can be configured 
   on the upstream or downstream interfaces of the monitoring 
   equipments. In this example, downstream interface of the root node 
   is configured as MEP_I, upstream and downstream interfaces of 
   intermediate nodes are configured as MIPs, and upstream interfaces 
   of leaf nodes are configured as MEP_Es.

     Figure 1. An example of multicast forwarding tree to be monitored 

   Three types of configuration TLVs are defined for different 
   functional entities; they are MEP_E Configuration TLV, MEP_I 
   Configuration TLV and MIP Configuration TLV for MEP_E, MEP_I and MIP 
   entity configuration respectively. Network management personnel 
   could make their own decision to include which TLV in the attribute, 
   depending on the monitoring requirement.  

   In each Configuration TLV, different measurement function 
   information could be carried. Network management personnel could e.g. 
   either enable a packet delay measurement function on the upstream 
   interface of an intermediate node, or set up the OAM packet sending 
   period at the MEP_E. See section 3.1 and 3.2 for the format of M-PMC 
   Join Attribute and different type of Configuration TLVs. 

    

2.2. Sending M-PMC Join Attribute 

   If the leaf router is initiated for configuration, it will include 
   the M-PMC Join Attribute when sending a PIM Join message. 
   Configuration TLVs for different measurement entities will be 
   included in the attribute, and sent hop-by-hop towards the upstream 
   router and the root (either the source or RP router) along the 
   multicast tree. Not all types of TLV need to present in the 
   attribute, but at least MEP_I Configuration TLV will present. See

   section 3.1 and 3.2 for the format definitions of M-PMC Join 
   Attribute and different type of Configuration TLVs. 

   If the leaf router itself is configured as MEP_E, then the MEP_E 
   Configuration TLV MUST NOT be included in the attribute. The MEP_E 
   Configuration TLV MUST be included in the attribute when a non-leaf 
   node on the multicast path is assigned as MEP_E. In this case the 
   interface address of that node will be included in the MEP_E 
   Configuration TLV. 

    

2.3. Receiving M-PMC Join Attribute 

   When processing a received PIM Join that contains an M-PMC Attribute,    
   a router MUST first check to see if the MEP_E Configuration TLV is 
   present. If so, it MUST then check to see if the Configuration 
   Interface Address in the TLV is one of its own IP addresses. If so, 
   it will apply the configurations described in this TLV to its 
   upstream and/or downstream interfaces. The MEP_E TLV is then removed 
   from the attribute, and not passed further upstream. If the 
   Configuration Interface Address is not any of its own IP address, 
   none of the TLVs will be applied and the attribute will be kept the 
   same and passed along when a PIM Join is sent upstream. 

   If no MEP_E Configuration TLV is present, a router MUST then check 
   to see if the Configuration Interface Address in the MEP_I 
   Configuration TLV is one of its own IP addresses. If so, the MEP_I 
   Configuration TLV will be applied and the whole attribute is then 
   removed from the Join message, not passed further upstream. If the 
   Configuration Interface Address is not any of its own IP address, 
   the MIP TLV will be applied when it is present. Otherwise, no TLV 
   will be applied and the attribute will be kept the same and passed 
   along when a PIM Join is sent upstream.

2.4. Conflict Resolution 

   On an upstream router, a conflict occurs when it has received 
   different PIM M-PMC attributes from Join packets sent by its 
   downstream routers. 

   As an example, considering Figure 1 and suppose a M-PMC Join 
   Attribute is used to configure the packet loss measurement function. 
   There are 2 receivers for the same group connected to Leaf2 and 
   Leaf3 respectively. Suppose Leaf2 wants to enable all the nodes on 
   its forwarding path this function and Leaf3 wants to disable all the 
   nodes on its forwarding path the same function. If both Leaf2 and 
   Leaf3 send a Join including an attribute indicating their 
   configuration to their upstream router Router2, Router2 will get 
   conflicting attribute. If this happens, Router2 SHOULD try to merge 
   the different attributes.  The upstream interface E and downstream 
   interface G should be enabled for packet loss measurement function, 
   and another downstream interface H should be disabled for this 
   function. An emerged attribute of enabling the function will be and 
   included passed along when a PIM Join is sent upstream. 

   In any case if a branching point router fails to merge the 
   conflicting attributes, no more attribute should be passed further 
   upstream and the configuration is halted. An alert should be sent to 
   the NMS immediately. This could be done by a mechanism provided by 
   NMS and is out of scope of this draft.

2.5. Configuration Failure 

   In any case if a node on the multicast forwarding path fails to 
   perform the configuration indicating by the M-PMC attribute, no more 
   attribute should be passed further upstream and the configuration is 
   halted.  

   An alert should be sent to the NMS immediately. It could be done by 
   a mechanism provided by NMS and is out of scope of this draft.

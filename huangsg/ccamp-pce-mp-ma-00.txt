                 Plane (MP) Based on Mobile Agent (MA)
                    draft-huangsg-ccamp-pce-mp-ma-00

Abstract

   We propose an interaction scheme using Mobile Agent (MA) between the
   Path Computation Element (PCE) and Management Plane (MP) to solve
   information collection delay and management message congestion.

   It is a new collaboration mechanism about MP in intelligent optical
   networks.  This mechanism also specifies a flexible communication
   mode between MP and PCE.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Introduction

   In intelligent optical network, the interaction between the control
   plane and management plane includes information transmission and
   parameters configuration.  For more businesses and services are
   loaded on the networks, the management plane requires large
   quantities of data from control plane.  Simultaneously, Path
   computation in large, multi-domain networks is complex and may
   require special computational components and cooperation between the
   elements in different domains.

   In this context, the architecture for a Path Computation Element
   (PCE)-based model was proposed to address this problem space.  The
   Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions in
   support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  Many valuable
   extensions to the Path Computation Element and Path Computation
   Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) were published.

   With MA we can dynamically submit information to MP in multi-layer
   and multi-domain optical networks.  With the introduction of Path
   Computation Elements (PCEs), routes can be calculated more
   efficiently in distributed multi-domain optical networks.  Now we
   still encounter the storm or overflow of control bandwidth with
   hundreds to thousands of nodes in the network, in which distributed
   approach may result in slow convergence and local information at
   routing calculations and resource monitoring.  So we need an
   appropriate mechanism to achieve better interaction between PCE and
   MP.

   This document presents mobile agent as a collaboration transport
   mechanism between MP and PCE in optical networks.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   MP (Management plane): The management plane performs management
   functions for the transport plane, the control plane and the system
   as a whole.  It also provides coordination between all the planes.

   PCE (Path Computation Element): an entity (component, application, or

   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

   MA(Mobile Agent):A mobile agent is a software agent that can move
   between locations.


2.  Considerations of MP-MA-PCE mechanism

2.1.  Motivation

   In multi-layer and multi-domain Wavelength Switched Optical Network
   (WSON), with the introduction of Path Computation Elements (PCEs),
   routes can be calculated more efficiently in distributed multi-domain
   optical networks.  But we still encountered the storm or overflow of
   control bandwidth.  So we need the assistance of management with the
   nature attributes of centrality.  The cooperation of PCE and
   MP realized the advantage integration of distributed and
   centralized approaches.

   As RFC4655 described, the PCE operates on a synchronized TED , and
   TED contains plenty of massage about current network and resources of
   a network node (such as an edge router or LER).Based on these
   information , multifarious policy can be carried out on management
   plane, such as resource monitoring, dynamic traffic adjustment and
   service management.

   However, in SNMP, an agent is a network-management software module
   that resides on a managed device as a fixed agent.  An agent has
   local knowledge of management information and translates that
   information to or from an SNMP specific form.

   Different with this kind of fixed agent, mobile agent takes the
   codes which are used to process data and goes through the locations
   of the node in the network, and the management is done in the
   location side.  In general, MA-based management has the following
   benefits:

   1) Reduction in network traffic.  Code is very often smaller than
   data that it processes, so the transfer of MAs to the sources of data
   creates less traffic.

   2) Interaction with real-time systems.  Installing a MA close to a
   real-time system may prevent delays caused by network congestion.

   3) Easy software upgrades.  The exchange of MAs can be done virtually
   arbitrary.

2.2.  Model

   A simple diagram about the mechanism is as follow.  With MA, PCEs can
   provide crafted data to MP, so that flexible policy-based network
   management may be carried out effectively.  Accordingly, the MP may
   configurate PCE dynamically and timely .  It is no need to expand
   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).

3.  Problem Statement and Requirements Overview

   MA belongs to the MP, and MP can create a MA and dispatch it to 
   networks for collecting information produced in PCE and configure it.

   MA can transport itself from one PCE in a network to another, and
   resume its execution.  Certainly all the parameters MA needed must be
   provided by management plane.  That is, MP can use the user interface
   to do the configuration of MA.  When the agent arrives at the
   location listed in the agent communications table it executes the
   management functions.  After all the nodes which are listed in the
   agent communications table are accessed , this agent finally return to
   management plane and deposit the results and state to the MP.

   The most common approach is that the MP is able to set threshold
   values for all supported MA, and that network elements (eg.PCE) are
   capable of triggering associated threshold crossing alerts (TCA),
   which should be sent to MP.  MP collects the performance parameters
   through MA presented in and analyzes through policy maker to track
   the network operational state in order to be able to take corrective

   actions whenever needed.


4.  Communication between modules

   R1: MA can be generated by MAG (MA generator, according to the task
   and corresponding policy generate MA dynamically) in MP.

   R2: MAEE (MA executive environment) is a module which receives MA and
   provides executive environment, and it can also be the socket between
   MA and PCE module.  MAEE should be equipped in every network node.

   R3: It is assumed that all network elements have been assigned an
   identifier in the management plane, so that MA can track the network
   in order to be able to take corrective actions.

   R4: PCEs transfer its data to MA through MAEE, and the codes process
   data on local module.

   R5: MA is characterized by a life-cycle model, a computational model,
   a security model, a communication model and especially a navigation
   model.


5.  Security Considerations

   The impact of the use of this mechanism on the security of existing
   PCE, signaling protocols and techniques in use within the network
   must be considered.

   This mechanism has connections to the PCE and the Management Plane.
   Specially crafted packets could eventually be used to gain access to
   the PCE with potential incidence in network management applications.
   This is for further study.

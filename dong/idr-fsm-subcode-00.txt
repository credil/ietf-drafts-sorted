Abstract 

   This document defines several subcodes for BGP Finite State Machine 
   Error that could provide more information to help network operators 
   in diagnosing BGP FSM issues and correlating network events. It also 
   provides a mechanism for BGP speaker to notify its peer the reason 
   for last time session flap after the session comes up again.

1. Introduction 

   This document defines several subcodes for BGP Finite State Machine 
   Error that could provide more information to help network operators 
   in diagnosing BGP FSM issues and correlating network events. It also 
   provides a general mechanism for BGP speaker to notify its peer 
   additional information about the session. This document defines two 
   kinds of BGP Session Information: reason for last time session flap 
   and BGP speaker description. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Definition of Finite State Machine Error Subcodes 

   This document defines following subcodes for BGP Finite State Machine 
   Error: 

     0 - Unspecific Error 

     1 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State 

     2 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State 

     3 - Receive Unexpected Message in Established State  

     4 - Error Caused by TCP connection problem 

4. Usage of FSM Error Subcodes  

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message 
   (KEEPALIVE/UPDATE/ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session in OpenSent 
   state, it MUST send to the neighbor a Notification message with the 
   Error Code Finite State Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Receive 
   Unexpected Message in OpenSent State". The Data field is a 1-octet 
   unsigned integer which indicates type of the unexpected message. 

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (OPEN/UPDATE/ROUTE-
   REFRESH message) on a session in OpenConfirm state, it MUST send to 
   the neighbor a Notification message with the Error Code Finite State 
   Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected Message in 
   OpenConfirm State". The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned integer 
   which indicates type of the unexpected message. 

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (OPEN message) on a 
   session in Established state, it MUST send to the neighbor a 
   Notification message with the Error Code Finite State Machine Error 
   and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected Message in Established 
   State". The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned integer which indicates 
   type of the unexpected message. 

   If there is some problem in the underlying TCP connection, such as 
   connection closed, connection reset or connection timeout, the BGP 
   speaker SHOULD generate a Notification message with the Error Code 
   Finite State Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Error Caused by TCP 
   connection problem". This message MUST be recorded locally and SHOULD 
   be prepared to be sent to Network Management System (NMS) and BMP 
   monitoring station.

Internet-Draft          BGP FSM Error Subcode               March 2010 
    

   In response to any other Finite State Machine error, the BGP speaker 
   SHOULD generate a Notification message with the Error Code Finite 
   State Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Unspecific Error".  

5. BGP Session Information Capability 

   When there is some problem in underlying TCP connection, the Error 
   Code and Error Subcode cannot be advertised to peer because the 
   transmission is interrupted. Thus a mechanism is needed to send TCP 
   related Error information to peer when the session comes up again. 
   This document proposes to use a new BGP Capability to carry this 
   information, called BGP Session Information Capability. 

   A BGP speaker that is willing to announce additional information 
   about the session can use this capability as described below. 
   [RFC5492] 

   BGP Open message Parameter: 2 (Capability) 

   BGP Open message Parameter Length: Variable (Minimum: 2, Maximum: 255) 

   Capability Code: <Session Information Capability - TBA> (1 octet) 

   Capability Length: Variable (1 octet) 

   Capability Value: One or more informational entries as shown in 
   Figure 1. 

               +-----------------------------------+ 
               | Information Type (1 octet)        | 
               +-----------------------------------+ 
               | Information Len (1 octet, Min: 2) | 
               +-----------------------------------+ 
               | Information Value (Var length)    | 
               +-----------------------------------+ 
                            Figure 1 

   This document defines following types of BGP Session Information:  

    

   Information Type: 1 (BGP Session Last Flap Cause) 

   Information Len: 4 (1 Octet) 

   Information Value: (2 Octets)

Internet-Draft          BGP FSM Error Subcode               March 2010 
    

      Notification "Code" value of last session flap event followed by 
      Notification "Sub-Code" value of last session flap event. 

    

   Information Type: 2 (BGP Speaker Description) 

   Information Len: Variable (Min: 2) 

   Information value: Brief description of the BGP speaker in English 
   ASCII format. 

    

   Additional information types can be added to this TLV on a need basis.  

6. Operation of BGP Session Information Capability 

   A BGP speaker that is willing to announce additional information 
   about the session should advertise the BGP Session Information 
   Capability to the peer using BGP Capability advertisement as 
   described in Section 5. [RFC5492] 

   A BGP speaker that receives Session Information Capability must 
   process and take necessary actions as appropriate. Since this 
   capability is mainly informational, contents must be stored and 
   presented to NMS. If unknown information type is found inside 
   information capability, it must be ignored. 

   "BGP Session Last Flap Cause" information is used to convey to the 
   peer, the reason for last session flap. A session is considered 
   "flapped" only if the session state ever moves out of the 
   "Established" state.  

   "BGP Speaker Description" information is used to convey additional 
   description type information to the peer. Typically this is useful 
   during BGP sessions trouble-shooting. This information can also be 
   used for "description - IP address mapping" to reduce manual 
   configuration of peer's description. 

   It is possible for one to fill up entire capability with just 
   information capability. Keeping this in mind, "Information Len" field 
   has been intentionally limited to a single byte. It is recommended 
   that implementations should take necessary precaution and encode 
   information capability only if there is enough room in the capability 
   area. It should also be given lower priority when there is contention

   for encoding capabilities in the limited open message capability 
   parameter space. 

   However, this problem is not applicable after [I-D.chen-bgp-ext-opt-
   param] draft standardization is complete. 

7. Security Considerations 

   This document does not change the security properties of BGP.  

8. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines Error Subcodes 0 - 4 for BGP Finite State 
   Machine Error. 

     0 - Unspecific Error 

     1 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State 

     2 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State 

     3 - Receive Unexpected Message in Established State  

     4 - Error Caused by TCP connection problem  

   This document defines a new BGP Capability called BGP Session 
   Information Capability (TBA). This document defines following types 
   of BGP Session Information: 

      Name                               Type Value 

      ----                               ---------- 
      BGP Session Last Flap Cause            1  

      BGP Speaker Description                2

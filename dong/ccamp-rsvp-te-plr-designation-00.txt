Internet-Draft      Designation of PLRs in TE FRR           March 2010 
    

   This document defines RSVP-TE extensions which enable the ingress 
   node to designate particular LSRs along the path as Points of Local 
   Repair (PLRs) of the protected LSP, and further indicate the 
   protection type of each PLR. These mechanisms could enhance the 
   control over the establishment of backup LSPs, and also could save 
   the resources needed for establishing and maintaining unnecessary 
   backup LSPs.

1. Introduction 

   Currently the fast reroute mechanisms of RSVP-TE enable the ingress 
   node of protected LSP to indicate whether local protection is desired 
   and whether node protection is desired for this LSP. However, such 
   indication is relevant to the whole LSP, the ingress node cannot 
   indicate which LSRs on the path are desired to be PLRs, and the 
   protection type of each PLR. 

   This document defines RSVP-TE extensions to enable an ingress node to 
   designate particular nodes along the path as Points of Local Repair 
   (PLRs) of the protected LSP, and further indicate the protection type 
   of the PLRs.  

   These mechanisms could enhance the control of the ingress node of the 
   protected LSP on the establishment of backup LSPs. It is useful when 
   only a subset of the LSRs on the path are required to operate as PLRs, 
   and only some of them are required to provide node protection. Since

   in such cases not all of the LSRs need to perform as PLRs, these 
   mechanisms could save the resources of establishing and maintaining 
   unnecessary backup LSPs. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Problem Statement 

   RFC 4090 has defined mechanisms to establish local protection for a 
   particular LSP. The fast reroute mechanisms of RFC 4090 enable the 
   ingress node of the protected LSP to indicate whether local 
   protection is desired and what protection type is needed for this LSP. 
   However, such indication is at the granularity of LSP level, the 
   ingress node cannot explicitly indicate which subset of LSRs along 
   the path are desired to be PLRs, and the protection type of each PLR.  

   In some scenarios the ingress node may need to specify particular 
   LSRs as PLRs, and the protection type of each particular PLR. This 
   can be helpful in many aspects. Firstly, this enables the ingress 
   node to setup the backup LSPs in a more controllable way. Secondly, 
   this could avoid making LSRs which do not have enough resources to 
   provide local protections work as PLRs. Thirdly, this could save 
   bandwidth reserved for unnecessary backup LSPs. 

   The subsequent sections define extensions to RSVP-TE to meet the 
   requirements in such scenarios, and describe operations needed for 
   these extensions. 

4. RSVP-TE Extensions  

   The Explicit Route Object (ERO) is extended to carry information of 
   PLR designation and type of local protection. The low order bits of 
   the Reserved field in IPv4 prefix and IPv6 prefix subobjects are used 
   as flags to indicate whether the LSR represented by the subobject 
   should operate as a PLR and the desired type of local protection. 

4.1. Extensions to IPv4 Prefix Subobject 

   Two new flags are defined in this subobject. The structure of 
   extended IPv4 prefix subobject is as below:

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |L|    Type     |     Length    | IPv4 address (4 bytes)        | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    | IPv4 address (continued)      | Prefix Length |  Reserved |P|N| 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   P: Local Protection flag. The P bit represents whether this subobject 
   is designated as a PLR. It will be set to 0 if the node is designated 
   to be a PLR for the protected LSP, and set to 1 otherwise. If the 
   "Local Protection Desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object is 
   not set, no local protection will be used for the whole LSP, and the 
   value of the P bit is insignificant. 

   N: Node Protection flag. The N bit represents whether node protection 
   is required for this subobject. It will be set to 1 if node 
   protection is desired, and set to zero if the protection type is 
   indicated by the Node Protection Flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object. 
   Note the N bit makes sense only when the "Local Protection Desired" 
   flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object is set and the above P bit is 
   set to 0. 

4.2. Extensions to IPv6 Prefix Subobject 

   Two new flags are defined in this subobject. The structure of 
   extended IPv6 prefix subobject is as below: 

     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |L|    Type     |     Length    | IPv6 address (16 bytes)       | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    | IPv6 address (continued)                                      | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    | IPv6 address (continued)                                      | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    | IPv6 address (continued)                                      | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   P: Local Protection flag. The P bit represents whether this subobject 
   is designated as a PLR. It will be set to 0 if the node is designated 
   to be a PLR for the protected LSP, and set to 1 otherwise. If the

   "Local Protection Desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object is 
   not set, no local protection will be used for the whole LSP, and the 
   value of the P bit is insignificant. 

   N: Node Protection flag. The N bit represents whether node protection 
   is required for this subobject. It will be set to 1 if node 
   protection is desired, and set to zero if the protection type is 
   indicated by the Node Protection Flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object. 
   Note the N bit makes sense only when the "Local Protection Desired" 
   flag in the SESSION ATTRIBUTE Object is set and the P bit is set to 0. 

4.3. Backward Compatibility 

   The P bit and N bit are designed to be backward compatible with 
   current protection mechanisms. LSRs which do not support this 
   extension will treat these bits as reserved bit and ignore the value 
   of them. When both the 2 bits are set to 0 by head end LSR, the 
   protection behavior of all other LSRs on the path (no matter support 
   this extension or not) is the same as current mechanisms. 

5. Selection of PLRs  

   The selection of PLRs and the protection type are determined by the 
   tunnel ingress node. Normally it can be based on local policy of the 
   ingress node and information about the network. For example, the 
   ingress node may decide to choose a subset of LSRs on the path as 
   PLRs and specify particular protection type to protect critical nodes 
   and/or links, or it may exclude some nodes from being PLRs to reduce 
   burden on these nodes and save bandwith.  

6. Operations 

6.1. Operation of Head End  

   If the head-end LSR needs to control the protection of the LSP, it 
   SHOULD set the P bit and N bit in corresponding ERO subobjects of the 
   PATH message properly based on the result of PLR selection. 

6.2. Operation of Other LSRs 

   If a PATH message is received, the LSR SHOULD check the "Local 
   Protection Desired" and "Node protection desired" flags in the 
   SESSION Attribute Object along with the P bit and N bit in 
   corresponding ERO subobjects, then perform protection based on the 
   flags.

   If some LSR on the path needs to add subobjects to the ERO, it MAY 
   set the P bit and N bit of the subobjects according to local policy.

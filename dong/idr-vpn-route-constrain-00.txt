Abstract 

   This document defines generalized procedures that allow BGP speakers 
   to exchange Route Target reachability information. This information 
   can be used to precisely control the propagation of different kinds 
   of Virtual Private Network (VPN) routing information. This method 
   avoids unnecessary advertising of VPN routes when more than one kind 
   of VPN is deployed in the network.

1. Introduction 

   BGP [RFC4271] has been widely used in many kinds of Virtual Private 
   Networks (VPNs) for exchanging routes and auto discovery information. 
   Route Target (RT) extended communities defined in [RFC4360] are used 
   to control the distribution of received information into VRFs.  

   [RFC4684] defines some procedures to restrict the distribution of VPN 
   routes. It defines a new MP-BGP NLRI with [AFI=1, SAFI=132] for 
   carrying RT membership information, which can be used to control the 
   propagation of VPN routes. The procedures are helpful in limiting the 
   propagation of VPN routes in networks where only one kind of VPN is

   deployed. If multiple different kinds of VPNs are used in the network, 
   the procedures in RFC 4684 are not sufficient for providing precise 
   control of VPN route distribution. 

   This document analyses possible problems RFC 4684 may meet with and 
   also provides solutions for these problems.

3. Multiple Kinds of VPNs in Service Provider Network 

   In many scenarios, it is possible that Service Provider (SP) needs to 
   deploy more than one kind of VPNs in their network. For example, one 
   SP may deploy both IPv4 L3VPN and IPv6 L3VPN, or both L3VPN and L2VPN, 
   or both unicast VPN and multicast VPN, etc. Note that using the 
   procedures of RFC 4684, the Route Target (RT) membership NLRI used 
   for controlling distribution of VPNs routes cannot tell which kind of

   VPN routes are wanted. Thus in these scenarios, the procedures of RFC 
   4684 are not sufficient to provide precise control for VPN route 
   distribution, some PEs may receive unwanted VPN routes. Detailed 
   analyses are given in sections below. 

3.1. Multiple VPNs with Different AFIs 

   Service providers may deploy multiple VPNs with different Address 
   Family Identifiers (AFI), such as IPv4 L3VPN (AFI=1), IPv6 L3VPN 
   (AFI=2) and L2VPN (AFI=25). When more than one of these kinds of VPNs 
   is deployed in the same network, using procedures of RFC 4684 can 
   lead to unwanted routes being received by some PEs. 

3.1.1. IPv4 L3VPN and IPv6 L3VPN  

   Some service providers need to deploy both IPv4 L3VPN (VPNv4) and 
   IPv6 L3VPN (VPNv6) in their network. The RTs used for VPNv6 can be 
   the same as the ones for VPNv4. However, it's likely that not all the 
   VPN sites are both IPv4 and IPv6 capable, some of them may be only 
   IPv4 capable, some other ones may support both IPv4 and IPv6, and the 
   others can only recognize IPv6 packets.  

   In Figure 1, suppose the VPN site of VPN-1 connected to PE-1 is only 
   IPv4 capable, the sites of VPN-1 connected to PE-2 and PE-3 are IPv6 
   capable. Using procedures of RFC 4684, PE-1 advertises the RT 
   membership information of VPN-1 to the other PEs. According to the 
   received RT membership information, PE-2 and PE-3 will advertise 
   VPNv6 routes of VPN-1 to PE-1. As a result, PE-1 will receive 
   unwanted VPNv6 routes of VPN-1. Similarly, PE-1 can also receive 
   unwanted VPNv4 routes of VPN-2.

   Even if RTs allocated for VPNv6 are different from the ones used for 
   VPNv4 on each PE, there can be some overlapping between the RT space 
   of VPNv4 and VPNv6 in SP backbone network, in which case some PEs can 
   also receive unwanted VPN routes of other VPNs. 

3.1.2. L3VPN and L2VPN  

   The mechanisms defined in RFC 4684 are claimed to be applicable for 
   L2VPNs which use Route Targets to control distribution of routing 
   information. However, if both L3VPN and L2VPN are deployed in the 
   same network, the mechanisms defined in RFC 4684 are not sufficient 
   for realizing accurate control of route distribution.  

   If there is some overlapping between the RT space of L3VPNs and 
   L2VPNs in the network, PEs will receive unwanted VPN routes of 
   another kind of VPN. 

   For example, in Figure 2, RT-1 is used by PE-1 and PE-4 for L2VPN-1, 
   and is also used by PE-2 and PE-3 for L3VPN-3. If PE-1 and PE-4 
   advertise RT membership information of RT-1 to other PEs in the

   network, subsequently PE-2 and PE-3 would advertise unwanted L3VPN 
   routes to PE-1 and PE-4.

3.2. Multiple VPNs with Different SAFIs 

   When the AFI value is the same, different kinds of VPN routes are 
   further differentiated using Subsequent Address Family Identifiers 
   (SAFI). Such routes may be needed by different sets of PEs. However, 
   the procedures of RFC 4684 cannot describe the requirements of routes 
   with a particular SAFI. 

   For example, Multicast L3VPN [MVPN, MVPN-BGP] and VPLS multicast 
   [VPLS-MCAST] have defined new SAFIs for exchanging multicast routing 
   information, and Route Targets are also used in these scenarios to 
   control distribution of multicast routing information.  

   Since MVPN is deployed on the basis of unicast VPN, they are always 
   coexistent in the same network.  


 
 
Dong, et al.           Expires April 19, 2010                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft      BGP Based VPN Route Constrain         October 2009 
    

   As [MVPN-BGP] says, by default the distribution of Intra-AS I-PMSI A-
   D route is controlled by the same Route Targets as the ones used for 
   the distribution of VPN-IP unicast routes. Thus PE advertising RT 
   membership NLRI may receive unwanted routing information, i.e., PE 
   wants to receive only unicast VPN routes corresponding to the RT may 
   also receive unwanted multicast routing information. 

   In Figure 3, suppose the site of VPN-1 connected to PE-1 only support 
   IP unicast, the sites of VPN-1 connected to PE-2 and PE-3 support IP 
   multicast. Using the mechanisms defined in [RFC 4684], PE-1 will 
   advertise the RT membership information of VPN-1 to the other PEs. 
   According to the received RT membership information, PE-2 and PE-3 
   will advertise multicast routes of VPN-1 to PE-1. As a result, PE-1 
   will receive unwanted multicast routes of VPN-1.

   Even if RTs allocated for MVPNs are different from the ones used for 
   unicast VPNs on each PE, there can be some overlapping between the RT 
   space of MVPNs and unicast VPNs in the network, in which case some 
   PEs can also receive unwanted VPN routes of other VPNs.

Internet-Draft      BGP Based VPN Route Constrain         October 2009 
    

4. Considerations about Route Constraint in IPv6 L3VPN  

   The format of RT membership NLRI in RFC 4684 contains a Route Target 
   field of 8 octets. However, [IPv6-EXT-COMM] has defined IPv6 address 
   specific Route Target with the length of 20 octets, thus the format 
   of RT membership NLRI is not applicable when IPv6 address specific 
   Route Target is used. From this point of view, an update to the 
   format of RT-membership NLRI is necessary.  

5. Considerations about Route Constraint in L1VPN 

   BGP is also used for L1VPN auto discovery as described in [RFC5195]. 
   The SAFI value 69 has been assigned for L1VPN auto discovery 
   information. If route constrain procedures are used in L1VPN, then 
   deploying both L1VPN and other kinds of VPNs in the same network can 
   lead to problems similar to the examples in previous sections.  

6. Proposed Solutions 

   This document proposes to extend RFC 4684 to a more general method 
   for controlling the route distribution of all kinds of BGP based VPNs 
   in any scenario.  

6.1. Length of Route Target Field 

   First of all, this document proposes to change the length of Route 
   Target field in RT membership NLRI to "variable". Thus the NLRI 
   format is compatible with IPv6 address specific Route Target and 
   other new types of Route Targets which can be defined in future. 
   Since the RT membership NLRI is encoded as defined in section 4 of 
   RFC 2858 (which is obsoleted by [RFC4760]), thus the length field in 
   RT membership NLRI can be used to calculate the length of Route 
   Target.  

6.2. Identifying RT Membership of Different VPNs 

6.2.1. Identifying AFI of VPNs 

   In order to identify corresponding AFI of VPN routes that the RT 
   membership NLRI stands for, this document proposes to extend the AFI 
   value of RT membership NLRI. The AFI of this NLRI SHOULD be one of 
   the AFIs that use Route Target to control route distribution. In 
   order to be compatible with RFC 4684, this document defines a new 
   SAFI called Generalized Route Target Membership. A new SAFI value 135 
   needs to be assigned by IANA. Thus the [AFI, SAFI] value pair of the 
   Generalized RT Membership NLRI could be [AFI=1, SAFI=135] for IPv4 
   L3VPN, and [AFI=2, SAFI=135] for IPv6 L3VPN, and [AFI=25, SAFI=135]

Internet-Draft      BGP Based VPN Route Constrain         October 2009 
    

   for L2VPN, etc. Since currently there is no fixed AFI value for L1VPN, 
   a new AFI value MAY need to be allocated by IANA, and the [AFI=TBD, 
   SAFI=135] value pair represents the Generalized RT membership NLRI of 
   L11VPN. 

6.2.2. Identifying SAFI of VPNs 

   In order to distinguish the control of different types of VPN routes 
   with the same AFI value, e.g. unicast L3VPN and MVPN, or unicast 
   L2VPN and multicast L2VPN, the Generalized RT membership NLRI MUST 
   contain information about the SAFI value of the VPN routes being 
   requested. Thus the Generalized RT membership NLRI can be accurately 
   identified as RT information of one particular type of VPN route. 
   Besides, if L1VPN and other kinds of VPNs are deployed in the same 
   network, and no fixed AFI value has been allocated for L1VPN, the 
   SAFI value of L1VPN is needed to identify RT information of L1VPN. 

6.2.3. Proposed Format of Generalized RT Membership NLRI 

   The format of Generalized RT membership NLRI is structured as follows: 

             +-------------------------------+ 
             | Length            (1 octet)   | 
             +-------------------------------+ 
             | Origin AS        (4 octets)   | 
             +-------------------------------+ 
             | SAFI of VPN       (1 octet)   | 
             +-------------------------------+ 
             |                               | 
             ~ Route Target     (variable)   ~ 
             |                               | 
             +-------------------------------+ 
    

   The Length field is used to identify the total length of the rest 
   fields. [Author notes: Though this field is defined as "the length in 
   bits" in [RFC4760], it is RECOMMENDED that it represents the length 
   in octets of the rest fields as in [RFC4761] for convenience.]  

   The Origin AS field contains an Autonomous System number. Two octets 
   AS numbers are encoded in the two low order octets of the Origin AS 
   field, with the two high order octets set to zero. 

   The "SAFI of VPN" field is the SAFI value of the VPN routes the PE 
   wants to import using the Route Target below.

   The Route Target field contains Route Target of VPN routes being 
   requested. Note the length of the Route Target field is variable, and 
   can be calculated using the Length field of this NLRI.  

7. Capability advertisement 

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange Generalized RT membership 
   NLRI, they MUST use BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure that 
   they both are capable of properly processing such NLRI. This is done 
   as specified in [RFC4760], by using capability code 1 (multiprotocol 
   BGP) with an AFI of the corresponding VPN and an SAFI of 135. 

8. Security Considerations 

   This document does not change the security properties of BGP based 
   VPNs and RFC 4684.  

9. IANA Considerations 

   IANA needs to assign the SAFI value 135 for Generalized Route Target 
   Membership. This code point will come from the "Subsequent Address 
   Family Identifiers" registry. 

   IANA MAY assign an AFI number for L1VPN. This code point will come 
   from the "Address Family Numbers" registry.

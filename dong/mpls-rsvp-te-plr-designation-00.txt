Abstract 

   This document defines RSVP-TE extensions which enable the ingress 
   node to designate particular LSRs along the path as Points of Local 
   Repair (PLRs) of the protected LSP, and further indicate the 
   protection type of each PLR. These mechanisms could enhance the 
   control over the establishment of backup LSPs, and also could save 
   the resources needed for establishing and maintaining unnecessary 
   backup LSPs.

1. Introduction 

   Currently the fast reroute mechanisms of RSVP-TE [RFC4090] enable the 
   ingress node of protected LSP to indicate whether local protection is 
   desired and whether node protection is desired for this LSP. However, 
   such indication is relevant to the whole LSP, the ingress node cannot 
   indicate which LSRs on the path are required to be Points of Local 
   Repair (PLRs), and the protection type of each PLR.

Internet-Draft      Designation of PLRs in TE FRR            July 2010 
    

   This document describes possible solutions for PLR designation in TE 
   fast reroute, and defines simple extensions to RSVP-TE to achieve 
   flexible TE FRR which is backward compatible with RFC 4090. 

   These mechanisms could provide the operators with more control of the 
   backup LSPs, this is useful when only a subset of the LSRs on the 
   path are required to operate as PLRs. Also, this could avoid 
   unnecessary signaling and bandwidth reservation for protection of 
   components which are not quite likely to fail. Thirdly, this could 
   relieve the burden on LSRs which may not have enough resources to 
   perform local protection functions. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Problem Statement 

   RFC 4090 has defined mechanisms to establish local protection for a 
   particular LSP. The fast reroute mechanisms of RFC 4090 enable the 
   ingress node of the protected LSP to indicate whether local 
   protection is desired and what protection type is needed for this LSP. 
   However, such specification is at the granularity of LSP level, the 
   ingress node cannot explicitly designate which LSRs along the path 
   are required to be PLRs, and the protection type on each PLR.  

   In some networks some of the links and nodes can be more reliable 
   than the others, e.g. some links may reside in the same building or 
   have redundancy in the physical layer, and some nodes can have good 
   redundancy in control plane. Thus there are fewer requirements to 
   protect such links and nodes on LSP level. 

   Based on the reliability information of the network and service 
   providers' local policy, the operators may prefer to protect only a 
   subset of the links and nodes along the path, thus the ingress node 
   needs to specify particular LSRs as PLRs, and the protection type on 
   each PLR. This can be helpful in many aspects. Firstly, this enables 
   the operators to setup the backup LSPs they need in a more 
   controllable way. Secondly, this could avoid unnecessary signaling 
   and bandwidth reservation for protection of links and nodes which are 
   unlikely to fail. Thirdly, this could relieve the burden on LSRs 
   which may not have enough resources to perform local protection 
   functions.

Internet-Draft      Designation of PLRs in TE FRR            July 2010 
    

   This document describes possible solutions for PLR designation, and 
   defines simple extensions to RSVP-TE to achieve flexible TE FRR which 
   is backward compatible with RFC 4090. 

4. Possible Solutions 

4.1. SERO Based Mechanism 

   GMPLS Segment Recovery [RFC4873] provides one mechanism to specify 
   segment recovery LSPs using SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE Object (SERO). 
   An SERO can indicate a recovery LSP's initiator and terminator, 
   standard ERO semantics can optionally be used in SERO to explicitly 
   control the recovery LSP, and a new subobject called Protection is 
   defined to indicate the type of protection or restoration to be 
   provided. Another new Object called SECONDARY_RECORD_ROUTE Object 
   (SRRO) is also defined for this procedure. Detailed mechanisms are 
   specified in section 4 of RFC 4873. 

   For MPLS networks which support extensions and Objects defined for 
   GMPLS such as SERO, SRRO and PROTECTION, and the operators need to 
   explicitly specify the path of the recovery LSPs, the SERO based 
   mechanism can be used. Currently there is no detailed specification 
   about the combination use of MPLS-TE FRR [RFC4090] and GMPLS segment 
   recovery [RFC4873]. This section only gives some brief instructions 
   to this mechanism, detailed specification is for further study.  

   Association between protected LSP and backup LSP: according to RFC 
   4090, the association is based on the same SESSION Object and the 
   same LSP ID in SENDER_TEMPLATE Object, the only field that varies is 
   the IPv4 (or IPv6) tunnel sender address in SENDER_TEMPLATE Object. 
   The ASSOCIATION Object defined in [RFC4872] MUST not be used. 

   Designation of PLR and MP: SERO is used to indicate the PLR and the 
   Merge point (MP) of the backup LSP, and optionally to explicitly 
   specify the path of the backup LSP. Note that explicitly designating 
   PLR and MP implies the protection type of TE FRR, i.e. Node 
   Protection or Link Protection. 

   The PROTECTION subobject in SERO is used to create the PROTECTION 
   object for the recovery LSP. For TE fast reroute, the protection type 
   SHOULD be set to 0x04 (1:N Protection with Extra-Traffic). 

   Note a node receiving a Path message containing one or more SEROs 
   SHOULD examine each SERO to see if it indicates a local branch point. 
   In scenarios where many backup LSPs are specified using SEROs, this 
   may bring extra burden to nodes which do not have enough control 
   plane resources.

Internet-Draft      Designation of PLRs in TE FRR            July 2010 
    

4.2. ERO Based Mechanism 

   For MPLS networks which do not support the RSVP extensions for GMPLS, 
   the SERO based mechanism may not be applicable. And for operators who 
   only need to designate the PLRs and the protection type, the 
   procedures of SERO based mechanism seems a bit complicated. This 
   section defines simple extensions to Explicit_Route Object (ERO) to 
   achieve flexible PLR designation and protection type indication. 

   The Explicit_Route Object (ERO) is extended to carry information of 
   PLR designation and type of local protection. The low order bits of 
   the Reserved field in IPv4 prefix and IPv6 prefix subobjects are used 
   as flags to indicate whether the LSR represented by the subobject 
   should operate as a PLR and the desired protection type. 

4.2.1. Extensions to IPv4 Prefix Subobject 

   Two new flags are defined in this subobject. The structure of 
   extended IPv4 prefix subobject is as below: 

     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |L|    Type     |     Length    | IPv4 address (4 bytes)        | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    | IPv4 address (continued)      | Prefix Length |  Reserved |P|N| 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   P: Local Protection flag. The P bit indicates whether this subobject 
   is designated as a PLR. It will be set to 0 if the node is designated 
   to be a PLR for the protected LSP, and set to 1 otherwise. If the 
   "Local Protection Desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object is 
   not set, no local protection will be used for the whole LSP, and the 
   value of the P bit is insignificant. 

   N: Node Protection flag. The N bit indicates whether node protection 
   is required for this subobject. It will be set to 1 if node 
   protection is desired, and set to zero if the protection type is 
   indicated by the Node Protection Flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object. 
   Note the N bit makes sense only when the "Local Protection Desired" 
   flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object is set and the above P bit is 
   set to 0.

4.2.2. Extensions to IPv6 Prefix Subobject 

   Two new flags are defined in this subobject. The structure of 
   extended IPv6 prefix subobject is as below: 

     0                   1                   2                   3 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |L|    Type     |     Length    | IPv6 address (16 bytes)       | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |                  IPv6 address (continued)                     | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |                  IPv6 address (continued)                     | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |                  IPv6 address (continued)                     | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    | IPv6 address (continued)      | Prefix Length |  Reserved |P|N| 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   P: Local Protection flag. The P bit indicates whether this subobject 
   is designated as a PLR. It will be set to 0 if the node is designated 
   to be a PLR for the protected LSP, and set to 1 otherwise. If the 
   "Local Protection Desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object is 
   not set, no local protection will be used for the whole LSP, and the 
   value of the P bit is insignificant. 

   N: Node Protection flag. The N bit indicates whether node protection 
   is required for this subobject. It will be set to 1 if node 
   protection is desired, and set to zero if the protection type is 
   indicated by the Node Protection Flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object. 
   Note the N bit makes sense only when the "Local Protection Desired" 
   flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE Object is set and the above P bit is 
   set to 0. 

4.2.3. Backward Compatibility 

   The P bit and N bit are designed to be backward compatible with 
   current protection mechanisms. LSRs which do not support this 
   extension will treat these bits as reserved bit and ignore the value 
   of them. When both the 2 bits are set to 0 by head end LSR, the 
   protection behavior of all other LSRs on the path (no matter support 
   this extension or not) is the same as current TE FRR mechanisms.

5. Selection of PLRs  

   The selection of PLRs and the protection type on each PLR are based 
   on the reliability information of the network and local policy of the 
   service provider. Service providers may have knowledge about which 
   links and nodes in the network are more reliable, such as have some 
   kinds of redundancy or are protected using other mechanisms, and 
   which nodes are not suitable to be PLRs, such as nodes do not have 
   enough control plane resources for PLR functions. Based on this 
   information, operators could designate a subset of LSRs as PLRs and 
   specify the protection type.  

6. Operations of ERO Based Machanism 

6.1. Operation of Head End  

   Based on the result of PLR selection and the required protection type 
   on each PLR, the head-end LSR SHOULD appropriately set the P bit and 
   N bit in corresponding ERO subobjects in the PATH message.  

6.2. Operation of Other LSRs 

   On receipt of a PATH message, the LSR SHOULD check the "Local 
   Protection Desired" and "Node protection desired" flags in the 
   SESSION Attribute Object along with the P bit and N bit in 
   corresponding ERO subobjects, and perform local protection based on 
   these flags. 

   If some LSR on the path needs to add subobjects to the ERO, it MAY 
   set the P bit and N bit of the subobjects based on local policy. 

7. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce new security issues. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   There is no IANA action required by this draft.

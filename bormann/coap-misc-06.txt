1.  Introduction

   The CoRE WG is tasked with standardizing an Application Protocol for
   Constrained Networks/Nodes, CoAP.  This protocol is intended to
   provide RESTful [REST] services not unlike HTTP [RFC2616], while
   reducing the complexity of implementation as well as the size of
   packets exchanged in order to make these services useful in a highly
   constrained network of themselves highly constrained nodes.

   This objective requires restraint in a number of sometimes
   conflicting ways:

   o  reducing implementation complexity in order to minimize code size,

   o  reducing message sizes in order to minimize the number of
      fragments needed for each message (in turn to maximize the
      probability of delivery of the message), the amount of
      transmission power needed and the loading of the limited-bandwidth
      channel,

   o  reducing requirements on the environment such as stable storage,
      good sources of randomness or user interaction capabilities.

   This draft attempts to address a number of problems not yet
   adequately solved in [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  The solutions proposed to
   these problems are somewhat interrelated and are therefore presented
   in one draft.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   and indicate requirement levels for compliant CoAP implementations.

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

2.  A Compact Accept Option

   A resource may be available in a number of representations.  Without
   some information from the client, a server has no easy way to decide
   which of these would be best served.  HTTP has an Accept: request
   header that a client can use to indicate the media types supported,
   allowing the server to decide.  This header is somewhat unpopular as,
   for a web browser, there are too many media types to choose from, so
   -- even with wildcards -- there is no meaningful information to put
   there.  (This has changed a bit for AJAX calls, which may indeed have
   a specific media type preference.)  It is unlikely that machine-to-
   machine communication would have the same problem.

   A similar function to the HTTP Accept: header could be added to CoAP
   as an option in a much simpler way.  The CoAP Accept option would
   simple carry a value that is a sequence of octets, each of which is
   an acceptable media type for the client, in the order of preference
   (see Figure 1).  If no Accept option is given, the client does not
   express a preference.

         Figure 1: Accept option value: A sequence of media types

   Accept also has to be given an option type code, e.g. 6, in Table 2
   of [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  (Alternatively, as Accept appears to be
   mutually exclusive with Content-Type, the same option number as
   Content-Type could be used.  For both to have the same structure, the
   Content-Type option could also be repeated for every Acceptable media
   type.)

   The other addition that would be required is an error code that
   mirrors HTTP's "415 Unsupported Media Type".  This is indeed already
   listed as CoAP Code 35 in Table 3 of [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   Proposal:  Add an Accept Option.

   Benefits:  A Server does not need to specify one URI each for every
      possible media type that it wants to serve a resource under.

3.  URI encoding

   In HTTP-based systems, URIs can reach significant lengths.  While
   CoAP-based systems may be able to sidestep the most egregious
   excesses (mostly by simply applying REST principles), a URI such as

      /.well-known/resources

   can use up one third of the available payload in a CoAP message
   transported in a single 6LoWPAN packet.  Is there a way to encode
   these URIs in a more efficient way?

   Several proposals have been made on the CoRE mailing list, e.g.
   applying the principle of base64-encoding [RFC4648] in reverse and
   using only 6 bits per character.  However, due to rounding errors and
   occasional characters that are not in the 64-character subset chosen
   to be efficiently encodable, the actual gains are limited.
   Similarly, using 7 bits per character (assuming URIs contain only
   ASCII characters) only gives a best-case gain of 12.5 %, and that
   only in the case the URI is a multiple of 8 characters long.  On the
   other hand, the complexity (and danger of subtle interoperability
   problems) is not entirely trivial.

   Appendix A.1 defines a potential URI encoding that is slightly more
   efficient than the abovementioned ones.  However, even that was
   rejected by the WG for its unconvincing cost-benefit ratio, which
   then went on to discuss Henning Schulzrinne's proposal to add state.

3.1.  Stateful URI compression

   Is the approximately 25 % average saving achievable with Huffman-
   based URI compression schemes worth the complexity?  Probably not,
   because much higher average savings can be achieved by introducing
   state.

   Henning Schulzrinne has proposed for a server to be able to supply a
   shortened URI once a resource has been requested using the full-
   length URI.  Let's call such a shortened referent a _Temporary
   Resource Identifier_, _TeRI_ for short.  This could be expressed by a
   response option as shown in Figure 2.

            Figure 2: Option for offering a TeRI in a response

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-misc                    August 2010


   The TeRI offer option indicates that the server promises to offer
   this resources under the TeRI given for at least the time given as
   the duration.  Another TeRI offer can be made later to extend the
   duration.

   Once a TeRI for a URI is known (and still within its lifetime), the
   client can supply a TeRI instead of a URI in its requests.  The same
   option format as an offer could be used to allow the client to
   indicate how long it believes the TeRI will still be valid (so that
   the server can decide when to update the lifetime duration).  TeRIs
   in requests could be distinguished from URIs e.g. by using a
   different option number.

   Proposal:  Add a TeRI option (e.g., number 2) that can be used in
      CoAP requests and responses.

      Add a way to indicate a TeRI and its duration in a link-value.

      Do not add any form of stateless URI encoding.

   Benefits:  Much higher reduction of message size than any stateless
      URI encoding could achieve.

      As the use of TeRIs is entirely optional, minimal complexity nodes
      can get by without implementing them.

3.2.  Support for URIs with Binary Adresses

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-core-coap], the Uri option does not provide a
   way to distinguish an "absolute-URI" from an "absolute-path"
   [RFC3986]: the leading slash is omitted from the latter.  (Ticket
   #12.)

   The proposal to fix this is to split the option into three parts:
   "Uri-Scheme" for the URI Scheme, "Uri-Authority" for Host/Port and
   "Uri-Path" for the absolute-path.

   A further problem with that version is that the authority part can be
   very bulky if it encodes an IPv6 address in ASCII.

   Proposal:  Provide an option "Uri-Authority-Binary" that can be an
      even number of bytes between 2 and 18 except 12 or 14.

   o  If the number of bytes is 2, the destination IP address of the
      packet transporting the CoAP message is implied.

   o  If the number of bytes is 4 or 6, the first four bytes of the
      option value are an IPv4 address in binary.

   o  If the number of bytes is 8 or 10, the first eight bytes are the
      lower 64 bits of an IPv6 address; the upper eight bytes are
      implied from the destination address of the packet transporting
      the CoAP message.

   o  If the number of bytes is 16 or 18, the first 16 bytes are an IPv6
      address.

   o  If two more bytes remain, this is a port number (as always in
      network byte order).

   The resulting authority is (conceptually translated into ASCII and)
   used in place of an Uri-Authority option.  Examples:

3.3.  Where are Uri Options Used?

   A URI, represented by an appropriate set of Uri options (one or more
   of Uri-Scheme, Uri-Authority, Uri-Path, unless the default absolute-
   path of "/" applies) should be present in every GET, PUT, POST, or
   DELETE message, unless replaced by a TeRI.  The receiver of an ACK
   can figure out which URI the message pertains to by comparing
   transaction IDs.

   In a delayed Confirmable message that contains an asynchronous

   response to a GET, the URI is included again ("echoed back").

   In addition to the context provided by including the URI again in
   delayed responses, we propose adding a "Token" option, which can be
   included in GET, PUT, POST, DELETE messages, and is echoed back in
   exactly those cases where the URI is echoed back.  The Token allows a
   recipient of an asynchronous message to relate back to an earlier
   request and thus can be used as the long-term equivalent of what TID
   is for a single transaction.  The Token option value is a sequence of
   bytes, which is opaque to the server.  The option is critical.

4.  Option Encoding

   The option encoding in [I-D.ietf-core-coap] is neither particularly
   flexible nor particularly efficient.  One important, easily
   overlooked disadvantage of the encoding is the large number of ways
   in which the same information can be encoded.  This unneeded
   variability causes problems in interoperability and increases both
   coding and testing efforts required.

4.1.  A More Efficient Option Encoding

   The basic idea of the proposed encoding is to reduce the number of
   ways the same information can be encoded as far as possible (but not
   further).  This both simplifies decoding (e.g., an implementation
   that only ever uses short URIs never has to implement long options,
   because these can only be used with long lengths) and
   interoperability testing (there is only one way to say a specific
   thing, so there aren't multiple ways that need testing).

   One of the undesired variations in packets is the ordering of the
   options.  In this draft, we therefore mandate a total ordering of
   options, ordered by the option number.

   As an interesting consequence, the option numbers can now be
   expressed in delta coding, in turn requiring fewer bits to encode the
   option number.  This frees a number of bits for the length, making
   the likelihood of actually needing the two-byte form of the option
   header much smaller.

   To further reduce variation, the length of the value (as always, not
   including the option header) is now encoded in such a way that there
   is only one way to express a given length: The short form (one-byte
   option tag) can express length values from 0 to 14, and the long form
   is used for values of 15 to 15+255=270, inclusively (Figure 3).

       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

       Figure 3: Option delta/length representation with small range

   The small option delta of 0..15 in this encoding limits the
   difference in option value between two adjacent options (or the value

   of the option number of the first option).  While realistic sequences
   of options rarely will have a problem here, option numbers 14, 28,
   ... are reserved for no-op options with no body (implementations will
   automatically ignore these with zero additional code; see Section 4.2
   why the reserved values are not 15, 30, ...).  Note that the
   resulting delta that reaches the interim nop option may have any
   number, e.g., for including option 2 and 27 in one message, the
   sequence would be:

   o  delta = 2 (option 2, body)

   o  delta = 12 (option 14 = no-op, no body)

   o  delta = 13 (option 27, body)

   In the unlikely case that only option 40 is needed, the sequence
   would be:

   o  delta = 14 (option 14 = no-op, no body)

   o  delta = 14 (option 28 = no-op, bo body)

   o  delta = 12 (option 40, body)

   CoAP is designed to enable the definition of additional options by
   later extensions.  Typically, new options are designed in such a way
   that they can simply be ignored if not understood, i.e. new options
   are _elective_.  However, some new options may be _critical_, i.e.,
   there is no good way to process the message if the option is not
   understood.  (Actually, half of the options currently on the table
   are critical in nature.)

   In the option encoding proposed, odd-numbered options indicate a
   critical option; even-numbered options indicate elective options.
   (Note that, again, the even/odd distinction is on the option number
   resulting from the decoding, not the delta value actually embedded in
   the packet.)

   Implementing this proposal requires some renumbering of options from
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   Note that most options that are designated as critical are _not_
   meant to be mandatory to implement.  "Critical" just means if such an
   option is encountered in an incoming message, there is no meaningful
   way to process the message unless it is indeed implemented.

4.3.  Errors in Options

   When a message contains a critical option that is not understood by
   the receiver, we say that _decoding fails_.

   When a message contains an option that is defined for a specific
   length of value (e.g., Max-Age, which is only defined for length 1),
   this is treated like an unknown option.  For a critical option, this
   causes the decoding to fail.  For an elective option, this is not an
   error, the option with the unsupported structure is just ignored.
   (In both cases, the intention is to allow extension of the option by
   different syntax in a later revision of the protocol.)

   If the decoding of a message fails, the processing depends on the
   message type:

   o  NCN messages and RST messages with decode failures are always
      silently ignored.

   o  CON messages with decode failures lead to an RST with error code
      400 (Bad Request).  The payload of the RST SHOULD be a copy of the
      option bytes that caused decoding to fail.  However, nodes with
      minimal capabilities may choose to restrict their error processing
      to a minimum,

   o  ACK messages that fail to decode are hard to process.  The
      requesting node MAY repeat the request with fewer options in order
      to receive a simpler answer; if that is not possible, the decoding
      failure should be treated like a client error.  Conversely, nodes
      SHOULD not send critical options in ACK messages unless the CON
      message eliciting the ACK contained options that justify this.
      (There may be exceptions, e.g., a node is always allowed to send a
      Block option with a large resource representation.  A requestor
      that does not understand Block may never be able to receive that
      resource representation properly, so it is appropriate to treat
      the situation as a client error.)

4.4.  Payload-Length Option

   Not all transport mappings may provide an unambiguous length of the
   CoAP message.  For UDP, it may also be desirable to pack more than
   one CoAP message into one UDP payload (aggregation); in that case,
   for all but the last message there needs to be a way to delimit the
   payload of that message.

   We propose a new option, the Payload-Length option.  If this option
   is present, the value of this option is an unsigned integer giving
   the length of the payload of the message (note that this integer can

   be zero for a zero-length payload, which can in turn be represented
   by a zero-length option value).  (In the UDP aggregation case, what
   would have been in the payload of this message after "payload-length"
   bytes is then actually one or more additional messages.)

4.5.  User-defined Option

   To enable experimentation and community-specific options, option
   number 14 (the first NOP option) can also be used as a user-defined
   option.  For this application, the option value has one or more
   bytes, the semantics of which are defined by prior agreement between
   the communicating partners.

   It is RECOMMENDED to start the option value with a unique identifier,
   e.g., the SDNV [RFC5050] of the enterprise number of the organisation
   defining the option, possibly followed by additional discriminating
   bits or bytes.

   User-defined Options are elective.

   The User-defined Option is repeatable.

4.6.  Making the Etag option useful

   Problem:  The Etag option only allows for up to four bytes in one
      Etag.  If Etags are computed with a random distribution (e.g., by
      hashing the resource representation), the birthday paradox makes a
      collision surprisingly likely already for 1e4 variants in
      circulation.

   Proposal:  Allow longer Etags (i.e., don't specify a specific upper
      limit).  The default Apache Etag has about 8..12 Bytes of
      information in it (file ID = inode number, size, timestamp; which
      interestingly is mostly redundant with information available in
      Content-Length and Last-Modified).  If a tighter upper limit is
      desired, 8 Bytes should suffice for all practical purposes, but
      makes two-way gatewaying with HTTP more complex.

   Problem:  The Etag option is not useful without an equivalent of
      "If-None-Match".

   Proposal:  Make Etags useful by defining a new Option "I-Have": The
      I-Have Option carries a variable length octet sequence that
      specifies the Etag of a resource representation that is being
      cached by a client.  A client that has one or more representations
      previously obtained from the resource can indicate to the server
      that it has cached these representations, such that the server may
      omit the representation when the state of the resource does not
      change from a cached representation or changes to one of the other
      cached representation.  The I-Have Option may occur zero or more
      times.  (This can be used to represent a "If-None-Match" HTTP
      option with one or more Etags.  Note that CoAP always uses what
      would be called a strong validator in HTTP.)  As it appears I-Have
      and Etag are mutually exclusive, I-Have can use the option number
      of Etag.

Appendix A.  Things we won't do

   This annex documents roads that the WG decided not to take, in order
   to spare readers from reinventing them in vain.

A.1.  An efficient stateless URI encoding

   There is very little redundancy by repetition in a typical URI,
   rendering popular compression methods such as LZ77 (as implemented in
   in the widely used DEFLATE algorithm [RFC1951]) rather ineffective.

   For the short, non-repetitive data structures that URIs tend to be,
   efficient stateless compression is pretty much confined to Huffman
   (or, for even more complexity, arithmetic) coding.  The complexity
   can be reduced significantly by moving to n-ary Huffman coding, i.e.,
   optimizing not to the bit level, but to a larger level of
   granularity.  Informal experiments by the author show that a 16ary
   Huffman coding is close to optimal for reasonable URI lengths.  In
   other words, basing the encoding on nibbles (4-bit half-bytes) is
   both nearly optimal and relatively inexpensive to implement.

   The actual letter frequencies that will occur in CoAP URIs are hard
   to predict.  As a stopgap, the author has analyzed an HTTP-based URI
   corpus and found the following characters to occur with high
   frequency:

      %.aeinorst

   In the encoding proposed, each of these ten highly-compressed
   characters is represented by a single 4-bit nibble.  As the %
   character is used for hexadecimal encoding in URIs, two additional
   nibbles are used to provide the numeric value of the two hexadecimal
   numbers following the % character (the original URI will only be
   properly reconstituted if these are upper-case as they should be
   according to section 2.1 of the URI specification [RFC3986]; the
   encoder can choose to send all three characters in dual-nibble format
   if that matters).  An encoder could also map non-ASCII characters to
   this three-nibble form, even though they are not allowed in URIs.
   This gives compatibility with the %-encoding required by [RFC3986].

   All other characters are represented by both of their nibbles.  The
   resulting sequence of nibbles is reconstituted into a sequence of
   bytes in most-significant-nibble-first order.  Any unused nibble in
   the last byte of an encoding is set to 0.  (Upon decoding, this
   padding can be readily distinguished from another % combination as
   this would require another byte after the last byte.)  The encoding
   is summarized in Figure 5.

   An example encoding for "/.well-known/resources" (where the initial
   slash is left out, as proposed for abs-path URIs) is given in
   Figure 6.  While the more than 28 % savings in this example may seem
   just an accident, the HTTP-based corpus indeed shows an average
   savings of about 21.8 %, i.e. the sum of the lengths of the encoded
   version of all URIs in the corpus is about 78.2 % of the sum of the
   length of all URIs.  (The savings should be noticeably higher with a
   more RESTful selection of URIs than was available for this
   experiment.)

A.2.  Media-Types with Self-Describing Length

   Open Issues:  For coap-00, the Accept option proposed would have
      needed a way to handle two-byte media types (easiest if these can
      be made self-describing, at the cost of about 3 bits in the sub-
      type field; Figure 7).

   An self-describing representation for long mediatypes could look like
   this:

Appendix B.  Experimental Options

   This annex documents proposals that need significant additional
   discussion before they can become part of (or go back to) the main
   CoAP specification.  They are not dead, but might die if there turns
   out to be no good way to solve the problem.

B.1.  Options indicating absolute time

   HTTP has a number of headers that may indicate absolute time:

   o  "Date", defined in Section 14.18 in [RFC2616] (Section 9.3 in
      [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging]), giving the absolute time a
      response was generated;

   o  "Last-Modified", defined in Section 14.29 in [RFC2616], (Section
      6.6 in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional], giving the absolute time
      of when the origin server believes the resource representation was
      last modified;

   o  "If-Modified-Since", defined in Section 14.25 in [RFC2616],
      "If-Unmodified-Since", defined in Section 14.28 in [RFC2616], and
      "If-Range", defined in Section 14.27 in [RFC2616] can be used to
      supply absolute time to gate a conditional request;

   o  "Expires", defined in Section 14.21 in [RFC2616] (Section 3.3 in
      [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache]), giving the absolute time after which
      a response is considered stale.

   o  The more obscure headers "Retry-After", defined in Section 14.37
      in [RFC2616], and "Warning", defined in section 14.46 in
      [RFC2616], also may employ absolute time.

   [I-D.ietf-core-coap] defines a single "Date" option, which however
   "indicates the creation time and date of a given resource
   representation", i.e., is closer to a "Last-Modified" HTTP header.
   HTTP's caching rules [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache] make use of both
   "Date" and "Last-Modified", combined with "Expires".  The specific
   semantics required for CoAP needs further consideration.

   In addition to the definition of the semantics, an encoding for
   absolute times needs to be specified.

   In UNIX-related systems, it is customary to indicate absolute time as
   an integer number of seconds, after midnight UTC, January 1, 1970.
   Unless negative numbers are employed, this time format cannot
   represent time values prior to January 1, 1970, which probably is not
   required for the uses ob absolute time in CoAP.

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-misc                    August 2010


   If a 32-bit integer is used and allowance is made for a sign-bit in a
   local implementation, the latest UTC time value that can be
   represented by the resulting 31 bit integer value is 03:14:07 on
   January 19, 2038.  If the 32-bit integer is used as an unsigned
   value, the last date is 2106-02-07, 06:28:15.

   The reach can be extended by: - moving the epoch forward, e.g. by 40
   years (= 1262304000 seconds) to 2010-01-01.  This makes it impossible
   to represent Last-Modified times in that past (such as could be
   gatewayed in from HTTP). - extending the number of bits, e.g. by one
   more byte, either always or as one of two formats, keeping the 32-bit
   variant as well.

   Also, the resolution can be extended by expressing time in
   milliseconds etc., requiring even more bits (e.g., a 48-bit unsigned
   integer of milliseconds would last well after year 9999.)

   For experiments, an experimental "Date" option is defined with the
   semantics of HTTP's "Last-Modified".  It can carry an unsigned
   integer of 32, 40, or 48 bits; 32- and 40-bit integers indicate the
   absolute time in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC, while 48-bit
   integers indicate the absolute time in milliseconds since 1970-01-01
   00:00 UTC.

   However, that option is not really that useful until there is a
   "If-Modified-Since" option as well.

Appendix C.  Rationale: Representing Durations

C.1.  Text for section 3.2.1 of coap-01

   Various message types used in CoAP need the representation of
   *durations*, i.e. of the length of a timespan.  In SI units, these
   are measured in seconds.  CoAP durations represent integer numbers of
   seconds, but instead of representing these numbers as integers, a
   more compact single-byte pseudo-floating-point (pseudo-FP)
   representation is used (Figure 8).

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | 0...          value           |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | 1... mantissa |    exponent   |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+


           Figure 8: Duration in (8,4) pseudo-FP representation

   If the high bit is clear, the entire n-bit value (including the high
   bit) is the decoded value.  If the high bit is set, the mantissa
   (including the high bit, with the exponent field cleared out but
   still present) is shifted left by the exponent to yield the decoded
   value.

   The (n,e)-pseudo-FP format can be decoded with a single line of code
   (plus a couple of constant definitions), as demonstrated in Figure 9.

   #define N 8
   #define E 4
   #define HIBIT (1 << (N - 1))
   #define EMASK ((1 << E) - 1)
   #define MMASK ((1 << N) - 1 - EMASK)

   #define DECODE_8_4(r) (r < HIBIT ? r : (r & MMASK) << (r & EMASK))


                Figure 9: Decoding an (8,4) pseudo-FP value

   Note that a pseudo-FP encoder needs to consider rounding; different
   applications of durations may favor rounding up or rounding down the
   value encoded in the message.

   The highest pseudo-FP value, represented by an all-ones byte (0xFF),

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-misc                    August 2010


   is reserved to indicate an indefinite duration.  The next lower value
   (0xEF) is thus the highest representable value and is decoded as
   7340032 seconds, a little more than 12 weeks.

C.2.  Rationale

   Where CPU power and memory is abundant, a duration can almost always
   be adequately represented by a non-negative floating-point number
   representing that number of seconds.  Historically, many APIs have
   also used an integer representation, which limits both the resolution
   (e.g., if the integer represents the duration in seconds) and often
   the range (integer machine types have range limits that may become
   relevant).  UNIX's "time_t" (which is used for both absolute time and
   durations) originally was a signed 32-bit value of seconds, but was
   later complemented by an additional integer to add microsecond
   ("struct timeval") and then later nanosecond ("struct timespec")
   resolution.

   Three decisions need to be made for each application of the concept
   of duration:

   o  the *resolution*.  What rounding error is acceptable?

   o  the *range*.  What is the maximum duration that needs to be
      represented?

   o  the *number of bits* that can be expended.

   Obviously, these decisions are interrelated.  Typically, a large
   range needs a large number of bits, unless resolution is traded.  For
   most applications, the actual requirement for resolution are limited
   for longer durations, but can be more acute for shorter durations.

C.3.  Pseudo-Floating Point

   Constrained systems typically avoid the use of floating-point (FP)
   values, as

   o  simple CPUs often don't have support for floating-point datatypes

   o  software floating-point libraries are expensive in code size and
      slow.

   In addition, floating-point datatypes used to be a significant
   element of market differentiation in CPU design; it has taken the
   industry a long time to agree on a standard floating point
   representation.

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-misc                    August 2010


   These issues have led to protocols that try to constrain themselves
   to integer representation even where the ability of a floating point
   representation to trade range for resolution would be beneficial.

   The idea of introducing _pseudo-FP_ is to obtain the increased range
   provided by embedding an exponent, without necessarily getting stuck
   with hardware datatypes or inefficient software floating-point
   libraries.

   For the purposes of this draft, we define an (n,e)-pseudo-FP as a
   fixed-length value of n bits, e of which may be used for an exponent.
   Figure 8 illustrates an (8,4)-pseudo-FP value.

   If the high bit is clear, the entire n-bit value (including the high
   bit) is the decoded value.  If the high bit is set, the mantissa
   (including the high bit, but with the exponent field cleared out) is
   shifted left by the exponent to yield the decoded value.

   The (n,e)-pseudo-FP format can be decoded with a single line of code
   (plus a couple of constant definition), as demonstrated in Figure 9.

   Only non-negative numbers can be represented by this format.  It is
   designed to provide full integer resolution for values from 0 to
   2^(n-1)-1, i.e., 0 to 127 in the (8,4) case, and a mantissa of n-e
   bits from 2^(n-1) to (2^n-2^e)*2^(2^e-1), i.e., 128 to 7864320 in the
   (8,4) case.  By choosing e carefully, resolution can be traded
   against range.

   Note that a pseudo-FP encoder needs to consider rounding; different
   applications of durations may favor rounding up or rounding down the
   value encoded in the message.  This requires a little more than a
   single line of code (which is left as an exercise to the reader, as
   the most efficient expression depends on hardware details).

C.4.  A Duration Type for CoAP

   CoAP needs durations in a number of places.  In [I-D.ietf-core-coap],
   durations occur in the option "Subscription-lifetime" as well as in
   the option "Max-age".  (Note that the option "Date" is not a
   duration, but a point in time.)  Other durations of this kind may be
   added later.

   Most durations relevant to CoAP are best expressed with a minimum
   resolution of one second.  More detailed resolutions are unlikely to
   provide much benefit.

   The range of lifetimes and caching ages are probably best kept below
   the order of magnitude of months.  An (8,4)-pseudo-FP has the maximum



Bormann & Hartke        Expires February 25, 2011              [Page 28]

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-misc                    August 2010


   value of 7864320, which is about 91 days; this appears to be adequate
   for a subscription lifetime and probably even for a maximum cache
   age.  Figure 10 shows the values that can be expressed.  (If a larger
   range for the latter is indeed desired, an (8,5)-pseudo-FP could be
   used; this would last 15 milleniums, at the cost of having only 3
   bits of accuracy for values larger than 127 seconds.)

   Proposal:  A single duration type is used throughout CoAP, based on
      an (8,4)-pseudo-FP giving a duration in seconds.

   Benefits:  Implementations can use a single piece of code for
      managing all CoAP-related durations.

      In addition, length information never needs to be managed for
      durations that are embedded in other data structures: All
      durations are expressed by a single byte.

   It might be worthwhile to reserve one duration value, e.g. 0xFF, for
   an indefinite duration.

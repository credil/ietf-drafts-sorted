Internet-Draft             A set-key attribute             December 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new set-key attribute for use in the
   symmetric-key package structure defined in [Housley-symmkey].

1.1.  Set-keys

   A 'set-key' is a symmetric key associated with (and to be limited to)
   a specific set of participants.  Such a key can be used in many ways,
   including:

   o  To secure broadcast or multicasts of e.g., pay-per-view movies,

   o  To secure group-communication such as chat rooms, or

   o  To secure data-at-rest which belongs to a group (such as on an
      encrypted file-system or on a server).

   The only requirement of a set-key is that it be associated with a
   specific and unchanging set of participants.  That is, we make a
   distinction between sets and groups.  Sets are immutable structures:
   a set S of participants is a mathematical entity and does not change.
   A group, on the other hand, is a mutable structure that might have a
   certain name or set of names; may be under the control of a given
   administration; and may be mapped to a sequence of sets over time
   according to the needs of some particular application.  This document
   considers only sets, and therefore will not consider issues such as
   group-administration, adding or removing members, revoking keys, and
   so on.  Set-keys can be used to build group-keying protocols, but
   such issues are outside the scope of this document.

   We note that the participant-set of a set-key can be partitioned into
   two sub-sets: the active participants and the passive participants.
   In some set-key applications, such as group-chat, all participants
   may be active: both sending and receiving.  In other applications,
   such as multicast of pay-per-view movies, most participants are
   passive: only receiving.  Becuase it may be important in some
   applications to know which partipants are active and which are
   passive, we will allow these two sub-sets to be explicitly
   distinguished from each other.

1.2.  Symmetric key packages

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] is a standard
   notation and representation for cryptographic messages.  CMS is based
   on ASN.1 [X.680], [X.681], [X.682], [X.683] and uses that notation to
   define a number of structures relevant to cryptography such as
   certificates, encrypted or signed messages, and so on.

Internet-Draft             A set-key attribute             December 2010


   A current Internet Draft [Housley-symmkey] uses CMS to define a
   structure for symmetric key packages: collections of symmetric keys
   which share common properties and are intended for the same
   participants.  The syntax for this structure follows:


   SymmetricKeyPackage ::= SEQUENCE {
     version           KeyPkgVersion DEFAULT v1,
     sKeyPkgAttrs  [0] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute
                                    {{ SKeyPkgAttributes }} OPTIONAL,
     sKeys             SymmetricKeys,
     ... }


   SymmetricKeys ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF OneSymmetricKey

   OneSymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
     sKeyAttrs  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute
                                    {{ SKeyAttributes }}  OPTIONAL,
     sKey       OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }
     ( WITH COMPONENTS { ..., sKeyAttrs PRESENT } |
       WITH COMPONENTS { ..., sKey PRESENT } )

   KeyPkgVersion ::= INTEGER  { v1(1) } ( v1, ... )

   SKeyPkgAttributes ATTRIBUTE ::= { ... }

   SKeyAttributes ATTRIBUTE ::= { ... }


   A key-package (SymmetricKeyPackage) contains some meta-information,
   including attributes (sKeyPkgAttrs) [Housley-symmkey], and a sequence
   of key-structures.  Each individual key-structure (OneSymmetricKey)
   contains some attributes (sKeyAttrs) and some actual keying material
   (sKey).  Attributes in the sKeyPkgAttrs field apply to every key in
   the package, while attributes in a sKeyAttrs field apply only to the
   key in the containing OneSymmetricKey structure.  The same attribute
   cannot appear at both the package-level and the key-level.  That is,
   a given attribute can:

   o  appear in the sKeyPkgAttrs field but not in the sKeyAttrs field of
      any OneSymmetricKey structure,

   o  appear in the sKeyAttrs field of one or more OneSymmetricKey
      structures but not the sKeyPkgAttrs field, or

   o  not be included in the key-package at all.

Internet-Draft             A set-key attribute             December 2010


   Also, it is not required that every attribute be applicable at both
   levels.  That is, [Housley-symmkey] allows a given attribute to be
   valid for only the sKeyPkgAttrs field or for only the sKeyAttrs
   field.

   The grammar for attributes is quite complex and given in
   [Housley-symmkey].  We intend to use only a small subset of this
   grammar, and therefore do not reproduce it here.  We note, however,
   that it can be used to define a wide variety of attributes, such as
   attributes to represent the expiration date of a key or key-package,
   the intended cryptographic algorithm for a key, an identifier for a
   key or key-package, or the creator of a key or key-package.  As such
   attributes do not apply only to set-keys, however, we will not
   consider them futher in this document.

1.3.  Intended Usage

   The attribute defined in this document is meant to be embedded in a
   SymmetricKeyPackage structure, perhaps with other attributes as well.
   The resulting value will then hold a set-key in a common and standard
   format.  This format is appropriate both for transporting set-keys
   and for holding set-keys computed from some higher-level protocol.
   That is, one could create and distribute set-keys in this format
   through some distribution protocol, or one could use this format to
   hold set-keys computed by some protocol as Logical Key Heirarchy
   [RFC2627].

1.4.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  The set-key attribute

   The set-key attribute is used to associate a participant-set with a
   symmetric key-package, where the participant-set MAY be divided into
   the active and passive participants.  It has the following syntax:

Internet-Draft             A set-key attribute             December 2010


   aa-setkey-information ATTRIBUTE ::= {
        TYPE SetKeyInformation
        IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-setkey-information }

   id-aa-setkey-information OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
     iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9)
            smime(16) aa(2) XX }

   SetKeyInformation::= SEQUENCE {
        active     SetKeyParticipantSet,
        passive    SetKeyParticipantSet OPTIONAL }

   SetKeyParticipantSet ::= CHOICE {
        union        [0] SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF SetKeyParticipantSet,
        intersection [1] SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF SetKeyParticipantSet,
        setdiff      [2] SEQUENCE {
                          orig SetKeyParticipantSet,
                          without SetKeyParticipantSet },
        community    [3] Community,
        groupID      [4] OCTET STRING,
        explicit     [5] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF SetMember,
        ...}

   SetMember ::= CHOICE {
        issuerAndSerialNumber  [0] IssuerAndSerialNumber,
        publicKey              [1] SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
        participantID          [2] OCTET STRING,
        ...}


   This attribute SHOULD NOT appear in the sKeyAttrs field of a
   OneSymmetricKey structure.  That is, it is defined to apply only to
   symmetric-key packages, not individual keys.

   The 'active' and 'passive' fields jointly identify the participant-
   set of this set-key.  The 'active' field identifies the active
   members of this set, meaning those which may use the key to protect
   data or messages.  The 'passive' field identifies the passive members
   of this set, meaning those participants who are expected to have this
   key but never use it to apply cryptographic protection to messages or
   data.  (They may use the key to process such protection, however,
   such as to decrypt the data or verify its integrity.)  Any member
   which could possibly send messages or protect data in some scenario
   SHOULD be in the 'active' field.  A member MAY appear in both fields,
   in which case it SHOULD be considered to be active.

   The 'active' and 'passive' SetKeyParticipantSet values SHOULD NOT
   represent an empty set:

   o  An empty 'active' set indicates (absurdly) that the key will never
      be used to encrypt any messages or data, and

   o  An empty 'participant' set SHOULD be omitted.

   Both the 'active' and 'passive' field will be values of type
   SetKeyParticipantSet.  These values can be any of:

   o  A 'union' of other SetKeyParticipantSet values.  The sequence of
      SetKeyParticipentSet values MUST contain at least two members.
      The semantics of this sequence is as follows: a participant is in
      the union if and only if it is any of the SetKeyParticipantSet
      values of the sequence.  If any set in the sequence is non-empty,
      then the union will be non-empty.  If all sets in the union
      sequence are empty, then the union is empty as well.

   o  The 'intersection' of other SetKeyParticipantSet values.  The
      sequence of SetKeyParticipentSet values MUST contain at least two
      members.  The semantics of this sequence is as follows: a
      participant is in intersection if and only if it is all of the
      SetKeyParticipantSet values of the sequence.  If any set in the
      sequence is empty, the intersection is empty, too.  If all sets in
      the sequence are non-empty, the intersection might still be empty
      (which it would be if there is no element common to all sets in
      the sequence).

   o  The set-difference ('setdiff') of two other SetKeyParticipantSet
      values.  The semantics of this is as follows: a participant is in
      the set-difference if and only if it is in the set identified in
      the 'orig' field and not in the set identified by the 'without'
      field.  If the set identified in the 'orig' field is empty is
      empty, then the set-difference will be empty.  If the set
      identified in the 'orig' field is a subset of the set identified
      in the 'without' field, then the set-difference will be empty.  If
      neither of the two previous cases apply, the set-difference will
      be non-empty.

   o  A community, which is used by the Trust Anchor Management Protocol
      (TAMP) [RFC5934] to identify a set of 'cryptographic modules.'
      Community values used in set-key attributes SHOULD represent
      unchanging sets of participants.

   o  A 'groupID', which is interpreted in an application-independent
      way.  One possible use for this option is to name pre-established
      groups such as organizational departments or roles.  The details
      of establishing or using such a name-space are outside the scope
      of this document.  However, the set of participants indicated by
      this value SHOULD be unchanging.

Internet-Draft             A set-key attribute             December 2010


   o  An 'explicit' list of SetMember values.  In this sequence, order
      is not given any meaning.  This sequence MUST NOT be empty.

   This structure may be expanded at a later date with additional types.
   Implementations SHOULD gracefully handle values and types which they
   do not recognize.

   Although the 'active' and 'passive' values SHOULD NOT represent empty
   values, sub-components of these values MAY be empty.  This is becuase
   resource-constrained entities may wish to do the miniumum processing
   required to verify that the 'active' and 'passive' sets are non-
   empty.  If the 'active' value is a 'union' value at the top level,
   for example, the sender may wish to terminate processing when it
   first finds a non-empty component of that union (as opposed to
   confirming that every component represents a non-empty set).  Senders
   MAY invest the processing necessary to ensure that no component of
   the 'active' and 'passive' sets represent non-empty sets, but
   receivers of these values MUST properly handle the case that a sub-
   component represents an empty set.

   A SetMember value, meant to identify a specific unique participant,
   can be any of:

   o  An IssuerAndSerialNumber value, defined in [RFC5911],

   o  A SubjectPublicKeyInfo, defined in [RFC5912], or

   o  A freeform ('participantID') octet-string, which is interpreted in
      an application-dependent way.  One possible use of this option is
      to use pre-established names for participants.  However, such
      values SHOULD refer to a single participant, and SHOULD have a
      static (unchanging) meaning.  The details of establishing or using
      such a name-space are outside the scope of this document.

   As above, this structure may be expanded at a later date with
   additional types.  Implementations SHOULD gracefully handle values
   and types which they do not recognize.

   A single entity can be defined in multiple different ways and in
   different locations.  One example of this is that a certified key can
   be identified using the IssuerAndSerialNumber option, the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo, or some application specific method (for
   example, a common name) in the freeform field.  This can cause
   ambiguity when evaluating a SetKeyParticipantSet.  Suppose that a
   given key is sometimes identified using the IssuerAndSerialNumber
   form (value 'I') and sometimes identified using the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfor form (value 'S').  If these two distinct values
   are interpreted as identifying distinct keys, then the following

Internet-Draft             A set-key attribute             December 2010


   structures may be misinterpreted:

   o  The 'explicit' sequence ...I, S... may be interpreted as having
      more elements than it actually does, due to the participant in
      question being counted twice (one for the I value, one for the S
      value).

   o  Similarly, the structure "union {...I...} {...S...}" may be
      interpreted as containing one more participant than it actually
      does.

   o  Likewise, the set "setdiff {...I...} {...S...}" may be interpreted
      as being non-empty when it is empty.

   o  On the other hand, the set "intersection {...I...} {...S...}" may
      be interpreted as being empty when it should not.  (It will always
      contain at least one element: the participant indicated by both I
      and S.)

   For these reasons, implementations SHOULD use a single method for
   identification of a single individual or have a well-established
   method of being able to compare the different locations that an
   individual could be identified in.

   If the set-key attribute is present, it MUST contain a single value.


3.  Security Considerations

   As with the entire symmetric-key package, the set-key attribute is
   not protected.  The symmetric key package content type can be
   combined with a security protocol to protect the contents of the
   attribute.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes use of object identifiers.  These object
   identifiers are defined in an arc delegated to the IETF S/MIME
   Working Group.  This arc and its registration procedures will be
   transferred to IANA soon.  No further action by IANA is necessary for
   this document or any anticipated updates.

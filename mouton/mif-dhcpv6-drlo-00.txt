              Default Router List Option for DHCPv6 (DRLO)
                  draft-mouton-mif-dhcpv6-drlo-00.txt

Abstract

   Neighbor Discovery protocol is currently considered as the best way
   for providing a default router to a client in IPv6 networks,
   typically using a Default Router List.  Hence it was not considered
   necessary for DHCPv6 to have this feature.  But, recently, some
   deployment scenarios expressed a need not to use Neighbor Discovery
   mechanisms.  This draft specifies a new DHCPv6 option providing data
   necessary for a Client's Default Router List (address, lifetime, MAC
   address) (indirectly, through the Neighbour Cache).

Internet-Draft         Default Router List Option            August 2011


1.  Introduction

   Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861] is currently considered as the
   best way for providing a default router to a client in IPv6 networks.
   Hence it was not considered necessary for DHCPv6 [RFC3315] to have
   this feature.  But recently, some deployment scenarios express a need
   not to use neighbor discovery autoconfiguration mechanism.

   This need is justified by configuration management centralization
   reasons.  Indeed, contrary to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC) [RFC4862] which needs to be configured in each router, DHCPv6
   configuration is centralized in a server; meaning that all subnets
   configurations are managed in one configuration file containing all
   prefix information, DNS server addresses, timers, etc.  Hence, one
   administering a large, complex architecture including numerous
   routers may prefer a centralized, stateful autoconfiguration solution
   like DHCPv6 rather than using SLAAC on each router which is more
   difficult to debug and reconfigure.  Other cases like multihoming may
   require a centralized autoconfiguration mechanism for traffic
   optimization reasons.

   This draft specifies a new DHCPv6 option.  This option provides data
   necessary for the ND Neighbor Cache and pointed to by the ND Default
   Router List (this data is coloquially named "a default router list"
   from here on).  This option is similar to DHCPv4 option router
   [RFC2132].  Contrary to DHCPv4, however, this option also provides
   router lifetime and optionaly router link layer address.  Lifetime
   and link-layer address are necessary for a coherent implementation of
   DHCP and ND data structures.  They are particularly useful in the
   context of mobility and multihoming for managing several default
   routers in order to solve continuity of service issues.

   The perspective of using DHCPv6 to provide a default route to a
   client was previously mentioned in
   [I-D.droms-dhc-dhcpv6-default-router].

   Additionally, [I-D.ietf-mif-dhcpv6-route-option] presents a method to
   distribute routes, in a generic manner, to DHCP Clients.  This draft
   does not explicitly treat the default router case, although it does
   exhibit a capability to communicate a default route as a particular
   case of a route (use destination prefix "::" with prefix length 0,
   and address of the default router).


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses also the terminology defined in [RFC3315],
   [RFC3963] and [RFC4862].


3.  Pertinence to the MIF Working Group

   The Multiple Interfaces WG (MIF) is treating of Hosts which have the
   ability to attach to multiple networks simultaneously.  The WG is
   chartered to produce, among other products, extensions to DHCPv6 to
   "provision client nodes with small amount of static routing
   information".

   The mechanism described in this draft, can be used to communicate
   several default routes (triplets gw-mac-lifetime) to a single Host
   which can have several interfaces.

   The distinction among the default routes (once installed on a Client)
   can be realized according to various criteria: (1) use a form of
   Preferences, new extensions similar to RFC 4191, (2) use the Lifetime
   communicated by the mechanism of this draft to distinguish among
   default routes according to new rules, (3) use a random function to
   pick a default route, (4) use a new interface name in the ORO and in
   the Ack to specify which default route uses which interface, (5) use
   a new field containing a source address which the Client must use for
   a particular default route, and more.


4.  Scenario description

4.1.  Topologies

   This section describes two simple topologies: one involving a server
   and a client and another implying in addition a relay.

   Client/Server topology:


                          +------+        +------+
                          |DHCPv6|--------|DHCPv6|
                          |server|ethernet|client|
                          +------+        +------+


                  Figure 1: Simple Client-Server topology

   In this topology, a client with no IPv6 configuration needs to obtain

   an Internet access and doesn't intend to use SLAAC.  It asks the
   DHCPv6 Server the three necessary settings: an IPv6 address, a
   default router address and a DNS server in a solicit message.  The
   DHCPv6 Server receives this Solicit message and sends back the
   parameters necessary fo IPv6 configuration.

   Client/Relay/Server topology:


                  +------+        +------+        +------+
                  |DHCPv6|--....--|DHCPv6|--------|DHCPv6|
                  |server|ethernet|relay |ethernet|client|
                  +------+        +------+        +------+

               Figure 2: Simple Client-Relay-Server topology

   Again, a client with no IPv6 configuration tries to obtain an
   Internet access and doesn't want to use SLAAC.  It asks the DHCPv6
   server the same way than in previous figure but the DHCPv6 server is
   not in the same link.  The DHCPv6 relay takes client DHCPv6 message
   and delivers it to the server.  The server knows that the message is
   relayed and send its responses back to the relay.

4.2.  Message Exchange

   There are two main message exchange scenarios corresponding to the
   using or not of a relay.  The message exchange when not using a relay
   is the following:


                     +------+                     +------+
                     |DHCPv6|                     |DHCPv6|
                     |client|                     |server|
                     +------+                     +------+
                          |                          |
                          |    DHCPv6 Solicit        |
                          |------------------------->|
                          |                          |
                          |    DHCPv6 Advertise      |
                          |<-------------------------|
                          |                          |
                          |    DHCPv6 Request        |
                          |------------------------->|
                          |                          |

                 Figure 3: Client-Server message exchange

   A normal exchange between a new Client and a DHCPv6 Server consists
   in four messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, and Reply.  In a
   Solicit/Request packet a Client lists wanted options in the Option
   Request Option (ORO).  This option is composed of a list of option
   codes.  The DHCPv6 Server answers those packets with Advertise/Reply
   packets containing values for the options asked by the Client.

   The message exchange when using a Relay is illustrated in the figure
   below:


       +------+                    +------+                     +------+
       |DHCPv6|                    |DHCPv6|                     |DHCPv6|
       |client|                    |relay |                     |server|
       +------+                    +------+                     +------+
           |                          |                            |
           |    DHCPv6 Solicit        |      DHCPv6 Relay-forw     |
           |------------------------->|===========================>|
           |                          |                            |
           |    DHCPv6 Advertise      |      DHCPv6 Relay-reply    |
           |<-------------------------|<===========================|
           |                          |                            |
           |    DHCPv6 Request        |      DHCPv6 Relay-forw     |
           |------------------------->|===========================>|
           |                          |                            |
           |    DHCPv6 Reply          |      DHCPv6 Relay-reply    |
           |<-------------------------|<===========================|
           |                          |                            |

              Figure 4: Client-Relay-Server message exchange

   The relay receives the message from the client and forwards it to the
   server in a Relay-forw message.  The server replies to the relay with
   an advertise/reply message encapsulated in a Relay-reply message.
   The content of this message is extracted by the relay and sent to the
   client.

           OPTION_DEFAULT_ROUTER_LIST (TBA)

   option-len
           length of the default router list option in bytes.  It has a
           value of minimum 23 (decimal representation).

   router_address
           default router IPv6 address (16 bytes)

   router_lifetime
           16-bit unsigned integer.  Router lifetime in units of
           seconds.  Limit value is 9000 and 0 SHOULD NOT appear
           according to section 6 of [RFC 4861].

   lla_len
           8-bit unsigned integer.  The size of the link layer address
           of the router in bytes.  Equals to 0 if no link layer address
           is given.

   router_link_layer_address
           link layer address of the router.  Its length is not known in
           advance and need to be inquired in lla_len field.  This field
           is optional.

   This option contains an optional variable length field
   router_link_layer_address.  Router_address and router_lifetime
   field's size are fixed.

   There are two alternative possibilities of using router information
   in the list:

   o  Not using router_link_layer_address: DHCPv6 server communicates
      router_address and router_lifetime with lla_len equals to 0.
      Default router's information is finished at the end of lla_len.

   o  Using router_link_layer_address: DHCPv6 server communicates
      router_address and router_lifetime with lla_len equals to k, where
      k is the size of the link-layer address.  After the field lla_len
      the default router's information is finished after reading k more
      bytes.

5.2.  Optimization

   An optimization is possible: removing lla_len field for the last
   element of a default router list when that is not necessary.  Prima
   facie, one may consider that removing one byte may not be worth the
   effort of the implementation complexity.  This is why this draft

   proposes to apply this optimization in only one simple but fairly
   frequent case: if the last element (i.e. the triplet address-MAC-
   lifetime) of a list (if there are more elements) has no link-layer
   address.  As a matter of fact it has the advantage of removing 8 zero
   bits.  This case happens each time an administrator doesn't want to
   use router_link_layer_address.  This case is frequent enough to
   justify an optimization.  Moreover this optimization has been
   implemented and does not require a huge amount of intellectual effort
   (around 10 extra lines of code).

5.3.  Default router lifetime management

   This draft proposes to use default router lifetime in the same manner
   as [RFC4861].  This has the following consequences.

   When a default router lifetime is equal to 0 it MUST be deleted from
   the Default Router list, Neighbor cahce and other related Fowarding
   Information Bases.

   Following [RFC4861] section 6, this draft propose to limit the
   lifetime to 9000 (decimal) seconds.


6.  Open issues

   In addition of default router address, lifetime and link-layer
   address neighbor discovery mechanism also provide MTU, Hop limit,
   reachable time, retransmission timer and textual name of the
   interface.  This information can be defined in other DHCPv6 options
   extending this draft, if needed.

   DHCP and Neighbor Discovery protocol manage router lifetime
   differently.  [RFC3315] specifies lifetimes typically in a 4-byte
   field.  In the opposite, Neighbor Discovery protocol defines a 2-byte
   field for lifetime.  In addition, it defines a lifetime limit
   equalling 9000 making the use of 4-byte fields unnecessary.  Because
   of this, this draft proposes a 2-byte field for router lifetime.

   Simultaneous use of DHCP and Router Advertisement to communicate
   default routes is out of the scope of this draft.

Internet-Draft         Default Router List Option            August 2011


   default route and DHCPv6 in the email lists of DHC, MIF and 6MAN
   Working Groups.

   Recently, Tomasz Mrugalski offered insight about default routes
   potentially used by draft-dec-dhcpv6-route-option-02.  Mikael
   Abrahamsson suggested communicating a source address when discussing
   default route and DHCPv6.

   This work has been performed in the framework of the ICT project ICT-
   5-258512 EXALTED, which is partly funded by the European Union.  The
   organisations on the source list [CEA] would like to acknowledge the
   contributions of their colleagues to the project, although the views
   expressed in this contribution are those of the authors and do not
   necessarily represent the project.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The proper working of this extension to DHCPv6 to support default
   routers rely on using a unique number for OPTION_DEFAULT_ROUTER_LIST.

   In this sense, and when agreed to take on this path, IANA will be
   demanded to assign an option code to OPTION_DEFAULT_ROUTER_LIST, if
   deemed necessary.

   Currently, the local prototype implementation uses the number 66
   (decimal) for this field.


9.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations referring to DHCPv6 are described in
   [RFC3315] and other more recent Internet Drafts.  The new option
   described here should not add new threats.  However, it is worth
   mentioning that the high importance of a default route (it must work
   when everything else fails) represents also a high risk when
   successful attacks - if at all - happen.

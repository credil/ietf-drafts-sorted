      PPP IPv6 Control Protocol Extensions for Address and Prefix
                   draft-qin-pppext-ipv6-addr-pref-00

Abstract

   The IPv6 Control Protocol (IPv6CP) is a NCP that allows for the
   negotiation of parameters for an IPv6 interface over PPP.

   This document defines the IPv6 address and prefix configuration
   options that can be negotiated through the IPv6CP.

   The major part of the text in this document is taken from the
   previous RFCs.

1.  Introduction

   The point-to-point protocol provides a standard method for
   transporting network-layer protocol datagrams over point-to-point
   links.  It also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP),
   and a family of Network Control protocols (NCPs) for establishing and
   configuring different network-layer protocols.

   This document extends the NCP for configuring the IPv6 over PPP,
   defining the negotiation of IPv6 address and IPv6 Prefix.  The prefix
   negotiated by the means here should be used by the local node(usually
   a Residential Gateway) for allocating addresses to hosts on the
   attached networks.

   Notes: As in IPv4 networks, PPP(PPPoE) will still be an important
   mechanism for connecting broadband access users of IPv6.  To make it
   consistent in the way of configuring network parameters and simplify
   the implementations, it may be reasonable to extend the Configuration
   Options needed which is the mature way for PPP rather than involving
   additional mechanisms.

   In addition to this document, There is an expired WG item,
   [I-D.ietf-pppext-ipv6-dns-addr] that needs to be reevaluated.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Additional IPv6CP Configuration Options

   The IPv6-Address configuration option, type 'X'(TBD), provides a
   method of obtaining the IPv6 address to be used by the local end of
   the PPP link.

   The IPv6-prefix configuration option, type 'Y'(TBD), provides a
   method of obtaining the prefix to be used by the local end of the PPP
   link for the address pool.

   For implementational convenience, these options are designed to be
   identical in format and behavior to options which are already
   present.

2.1.  IPv6-Address

   Description

   This Configuration Option provides a way to negotiate the IPv6
   address to be used on the local end of the link.  It allows the
   sender of the Configure-Request to state which IPv6-address is
   desired, or to request that the peer provide the information. the
   peer can provide this information by NAKing the option, and returning
   a valid IPv6-address.

   If negotiation about the remote IPv6-address is required, and the
   peer did not provide the option in its Configure-Request, the option
   should be appended to a Configure-NAK.  The value of the IPv6-address
   given must be acceptable as the remote IPv6-address, or indicate a
   request that the peer provide the information.

   By default, no IPv6 address is assigned.

   A summary of the IPv6-address Configuration Option format is shown
   below.  The field are transimitted from left to right.

       IPv6-Address

       The sixteen octet IPv6-Address is the desired local address of
       the sender of a Configure-Request. If all sixteen octects are
       set to zero, it indicates a request that the peer provide the
       IP-Address information.

       Default

       No IPv6 address is assigned.

2.2.  IPv6-Prefix

   Description

   This Configuration Option provides a way to negotiate the IPv6 prefix
   to be used on local end(usually a Router or Residential Gateway) of
   the link for further allocating addresses to hosts on the attached
   networks.  It allows the sender of the Configure-Request to state
   which IPv6 prefix is desired, or to request that the peer provide the
   information.  The peer can provide this information by NAKing the
   option, and returning a valid IPv6 prefix.

   By default, no IPv6 prefix is assigned.

       IPv6-Prefix

       The IPv6-Prefix field associated with the Prefix-length field is
       the desired prefix of the sender of a Configure-Request. If all
       sixteen octects are set to zero, it indicates a request that
       the peer provide the prefix information and the length required
       is indicated in the Prefix-Length field.

       The fixed sixteen octet space is used no matter what exactly the
       available prefix length is.

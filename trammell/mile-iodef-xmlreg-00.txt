Internet-Draft            IODEF XML Registries                 July 2011


1.  Introduction

   IODEF extensions via class extension through AdditionalData and
   RecordItem elements, as per section 5.2 of [RFC5070], generally
   register their namespaces and schemas with the IANA XML Namespace
   registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/ns.html and
   the IANA XML Schema registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html,
   respectively [RFC3688].

   In addition to schema reviews required by IANA, these registry
   requests should be accompanied by a review by IODEF experts to ensure
   the specified AdditionalData and/or RecordItem contents are
   compatible with IODEF and with other existing IODEF extensions.  This
   document specifies that review.


2.  Expert Review of IODEF-related XML Registry Entries

   Changes to the XML Schema registry for schema names beginning with
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef" are subject to an additional IODEF
   Expert Review [RFC5226].

   The IODEF expert(s) for these reviews will be designated by the IETF
   Security Area Directors.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.


4.  IANA Considerations

   [IANA NOTE: The authors request that IANA include a note at the top
   of http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html, stating
   "Changes to the XML Schema registry for schema names beginning with
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef' are subject to an additional IODEF
   Expert Review [RFC5226]," and naming the designated expert.]

   This document specifies additional expert reviews for IODEF
   extensions, on the XML Schema registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html), in
   Section 2.

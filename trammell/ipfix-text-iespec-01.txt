Internet-Draft                IPFIX IEspec                   August 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IP Flow Information Export Protocol (IPFIX) [RFC5101] affords new
   levels of flexibility in defining Data Record formats through its
   Template mechanism, and new Information Elements via an IANA registry
   [iana-ipfix-assignments], enterprise-specific Information Elements,
   and inline information model export as defined in [RFC5610].

   However, XML representations of Information Elements as in the IANA
   registry [iana-ipfix-assignments] require transformation via XSLT (as
   used by IANA) in order to become human-readable, are not particularly
   easily human-writiable, and would require the inclusion of an XML
   parser in each IPFIX Exporting and Collecting Process for use at
   runtime.  IPFIX Templates and Type Information Export as in [RFC5610]
   are excellent for runtime, but not particularly human-readable.

   This document proposes a simple textual syntax for describing IPFIX
   Information Elements and IPFIX Templates, with human readability,
   human writability, compactness, and ease of parser/generator
   implementation without requiring external XML support as design
   goals.  It is intended primarily for use in human communication
   (e.g., in new Internet-Drafts containing higher-level descriptions of
   IPFIX Templates, or describing sets of new IPFIX Information Elements
   for supporting new applications of the protocol), as well as at
   runtime by IPFIX implementations.

   PLEASE NOTE that this is intended ONLY as a proposed shorthand
   format.  It is under ACTIVE development.  Authors are reminded that
   it is inappropriate to cite an Internet-Draft as other than a work in
   progress.  This draft will likely be subsumed into a greater effort
   to define how new Information Elements and recommended Templates are
   developed within and outside the IPFIX Working Group.  As such,
   implementation or use of this representation within other Internet-
   Drafts at this time is STRONGLY discouraged for implementors and
   authors who are not prepared to track each change to this draft, for
   it to be merged with other future work, or for it to expire entirely.


2.  Terminology

   Terms used in this document that are defined in the Terminology
   section of the IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] document are to be
   interpreted as defined there.  In addition, the following terms used
   in this document are defined as follows:

   textual Information Element specifier (IESpec):   A string
      representing the four important aspects of an Information Element
      within the Information Model or within a Template: its name, its
      number (with Private Enterprise Number if applicable), its data
      type, and its length.
   fully-qualified IESpec:   An IESpec as above, containing enough
      information to define an information element: at least a name,
      number, and type, and a length for types without a native length.
      IESpecs must be fully qualified to be of used in defining an
      Information Model or extensions thereto.
   partial IESpec:   An IESpec that is not fully qualified.

   Note that when the term Template is used in this document, it applies
   both to Templates and Options Templates as defined in [RFC5101],
   unless otherwise noted.


3.  Information Element Specifier Syntax

   The basis of this format is the textual Information Element
   Specifier, or IESpec.  An IESpec contains each of the four important
   aspects of an Information Element: its name, its number, its type,
   and its size, separated by simple markup based on various types of
   brackets.  Fully-qualified IESpecs may be used to specify existing or
   new Information Elements within an Information Model, while either
   fully-qualified or partial IESpecs may be used to define fields in a
   Template.

   Each aspect of information associated with an Information Element is
   associated with a type of brackets.  Bare words are used for
   Information Element names, () parentheses for Information Element
   numbers, <> angles for Information Element data types, and [] square
   brackets for Information Element sizes. {} Curly braces are reserved
   for optional and contextual use, described later in the document.

   The basic form of a fully-qualified IESpec for an IANA-registered
   Information Element is as follows:

   name(number)<type>[size]

   where 'name' is the name of the Information Element in UTF-8,
   'number' is the Information Element as a decimal integer, 'type' is
   the name of the data type as in the IANA informationElementDataTypes
   registry [iana-ipfix-assignments], and 'size' is the length of the
   Information Element in octets as a decimal integer, where 65535 or
   the string 'v' signifies a variable-length Information Element.
   [size] may be omitted; in this case, the data type's native or
   default size is assumed (see section Section 3.1.

Internet-Draft                IPFIX IEspec                   August 2010


   The basic form of a fully-qualified IESpec for an enterprise-specific
   Information Element is as follows:

   name(pen/number)<type>[size]

   where 'pen' is the Private Enterprise Number as a decimal integer.

   A fully-qualified IESpec is intended to express enough information
   about an Information Element to decode and display Data Records
   defined by Templates containing that Information Element.  Range,
   unit, semantic, and description information, as in [RFC5610], is not
   supported by this syntax.

   Example fully-qualified IESpecs follow:
   o  octetDeltaCount(1)<unsigned64>[8]
   o  octetDeltaCount(1)<unsigned64> (unsigned64 is natively 8 octets
      long)
   o  sourceIPv4Address(8)<ipv4Address>
   o  wlanSSID(146)<string>[v]
   o  sipRequestURI(35566/403)<string>[65535]

   A partial IESpec is any IESpec that is not fully-qualified; these are
   useful when defining templates.  A partial IESpec is assumed to take
   missing values from its canonical definition, for example, the IANA
   registry.  At minimum, a partial IESpec must contain a name, or a
   number.  Any name, number, or type information given with a partial
   IESpec must match the values given in the Information Model; however,
   size information in a partial IESpec overrides size information in
   the Information Model; in this way, IESpecs can be used to express
   reduced-length encoding for Information Elements.

   Example partial IESpecs follow:
   o  octetDeltaCount
   o  octetDeltaCount[4] (reduced-length encoding)
   o  (1)
   o  (1)[4] (reduced length encoding; note that this is exactly
      equivalent to an Information Element specifier in a Template)

3.1.  Native Sizes of Data Types

   If absent in a fully-qualified IESpec, the size is assumed to be the
   native or default size for the type, as follows:

4.  Defining an Information Model from IESpecs

   An Information Model, or an extension thereto (e.g., a set of
   enterprise-specific Information Elements supplied to a Collector to
   provide type information for information from a particular Exporter
   in the absence of support for [RFC5610]; or a set of new Information
   Elements compactly presented in an Internet-Draft describing a new
   IPFIX application) can be expressed simply as a newline-separated
   list of fully-qualified IESpecs.


5.  Defining a Template or Options Template from IESpecs

   A Template or Options Template can be expressed simply as an ordered
   newline-separated list of partial or fully-qualified IESpecs.
   IESpecs representing Scope Information Elements in an Options
   Template take the {scope} option as a suffix to the IESpec, e.g.:

   sourceIPv4Address{scope}

   A syntax for an encapsulation of templates (including e.g. template
   ID) is not yet defined.

6.  Security Considerations

   Any IPFIX implementation using externally-provided strings to define
   Information Models and Templates must perform validation on those
   strings to ensure safe operation, and ensure that parsers for these
   strings are not vulnerable to common faults (e.g. buffer overflows);
   further guidance is implementation and platform specific.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

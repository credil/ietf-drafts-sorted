Internet-Draft                MILE Template                    July 2011


1.  Introduction

   [TODO]


2.  Applicability of Extensions to IODEF

   [TODO: explain what makes a good IODEF extension. basically: is it a
   noun?]


3.  Selecting a Mechanism for IODEF Extension

   IODEF was designed to be extended through any combination of

   1.  extending the enumerated values of Attributes, as per section 5.1
       of [RFC5070];

   2.  class extension through AdditionalData and RecordItem elements,
       as per section 5.2 of [RFC5070]; and/or

   3.  containment of the IODEF-Document element within an external XML
       Document, itself containing extension data.

   Note that in this final case, the extension will not be directly
   interoperable with IODEF implementations, and must "unwrap" the IODEF
   document from its container; nevertheless, this may be appropriate
   for certain use cases involving integration with IODEF within
   external schemas.


4.  Conventions used in MILE Extension Documents

   This section outlines conventions used in MILE extension documents.
   Following these conventions ensures the documents produced by the
   MILE effort have a consistent terminology and are easily readable as
   a set.


5.  Document Template

   Documents describing am IODEF extension should follow the document
   template given in this section.

5.1.  Introduction

   The introduction section introduces the problem being solved by the
   extension, and motivates the development and deployment of the

   extension.

5.2.  Terminology

   The terminology section introduces and defines terms specific to the
   document.  Terminology from [RFC5070] or [RFC6045] should be
   referenced in this section, but not redefined or copied.  If
   [RFC2119] terms are used in the document, this should be noted in the
   terminology section.

5.3.  Applicability

   The applicability section defines the use cases to which the
   extension is applicable, and details any requirements analysis done
   during the development of the extension.  The primary goal of this
   section is to allow readers to see if an extension is indeed intended
   to solve a particular problem.

   In addition to defining the applicability, this section may also
   present example situations, which should then be detailed in the
   examples section, below.

5.4.  Extension Definition

   This section defines the extension.

   Extensions to enumerated types are defined in one subsection for each
   attribute to be extended, enumerating the new values with an
   explanation of the meaning of the new value.  An example enumeration
   extension is shown in Section 5.4.2, below.

   Element extensions are defined in one subsection for each element, in
   top-down order, from the element contained within AdditionalData or
   RecordItem; an example element extension is shown in Section 5.4.3,
   below.  Each element should be described by a UML diagram as in
   Figure 1, followed by a description of each of the attributes, and a
   short description of each of the child elements.  Child elements
   should then be defined in a subsequent subsection, if not already
   defined in the IODEF document itself, or in another referenced MILE
   extension document.

   Elements containing child elements should indicate the multiplicity
   of those child elements, as shown in the figure above.  Allowable
   TYPEs are discussed in the following subsection.

5.4.1.  IODEF Data Types

   The allowable TYPEs for attributes within IODEF are enumerated in
   section 2 of [RFC5070], and consist of:

   o  INTEGER

   o  REAL

   o  CHARACTER

   o  STRING

   o  ML_STRING (for strings in encodings other than that of the
      enclosing document)

   o  BYTE for bytes or byte vectors in Base 64 encoding

   o  HEXBIN for bytes in ascii-hexadecimal encoding

   o  ENUM for enumerated types; allowable values of the enumeration
      must be defined in the attribute definition

   o  DATETIME for ISO 8601:2000 [RFC3339] encoded timestamps

   o  TIMEZONE for timezones as encoded in section 2.9 of [RFC5070]

   o  PORTLIST for port lists as encoded in section 2.10 of [RFC5070]

   o  POSTAL for postal addresses as defined in section 2.23 of
      [RFC4519].

Internet-Draft                MILE Template                    July 2011


   o  NAME for names of natural or legal persons as defined in section
      2.3 of [RFC4519].

   o  PHONE for telephone numbers as defined in section 2.35 of
      [RFC4519].

   o  EMAIL for email addresses as defined in section 3.4.1. of
      [RFC2822].

   o  URL for URLs as in [RFC2396].

   In addition to these simple data types, IODEF provides a compound
   data type for representing network address information.  Addresses
   included within an extension element should be represented by
   containing an IODEF:Address element, which supports IPv4 and
   [RFC2373] IPv6 addresses, as well as MAC, ATM, and BGP autonomous
   system numbers.  Application-layer addresses should be represented
   with the URL simple attribute type, instead.

5.4.2.  Example Enumerated Type Extension Definition

   [TODO provide an example]

5.4.3.  Example Element Definition

   [TODO provide an example]

5.5.  Examples

   This section contains example IODEF-Documents illustrating the
   extension.  If example situations are outlined in the applicability
   section, documents for those examples should be provided in the same
   order as in the applicability section.  Example documents should be
   tested to validate against the schema given in the appendix.

5.6.  Security Considerations

   Any security considerations [RFC3552] raised by this extension or its
   deployment should be detailed in this section.  Guidance should focus
   on ensuring the users of this extension do so in a secure fashion,
   with special attention to non-obvious implications of the
   transmission or storage of the information represented by an
   extension.

5.7.  IANA Considerations

   [IANA NOTE: Despite the title, this section is NOT an IANA
   Considerations section, rather a template IANA Considerations section

Internet-Draft                MILE Template                    July 2011


   for future extension documents to be built from this template.  See
   Section 7 for IANA Considerations for this document.]

   Any IANA considerations [RFC5226] for the document should be detailed
   in this section; if none, the section should exist and contain the
   text "this document has no actions for IANA".

   IODEF Extensions adding elements to the AdditionalData section of an
   IODEF document should register their own namespaces and schemas for
   extensions with IANA; therefore, this section should contain at least
   a registration request for the namespace and the schema, as follows,
   modified as appropriate for the extension:

   Registration request for the IODEF My-Extension namespace:

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-myextension-1.0

     Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section of
   the document, or to an organizational contact in the case of an
   extension supported by an external organization.

     XML: None

   Registration request for the IODEF My-Extension XML schema:

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-myextension-1.0

     Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section of
   the document, or to an organizational contact in the case of an
   extension supported by an external organization.

     XML: Refer here to the XML Schema in the appendix of the document,
   or to a well-known external reference in the case of an extension
   with an externally-defined schema.

5.8.  Appendix: XML Schema Definition for Extension

   The XML Schema describing the elements defined in the Extension
   Defintion section is given here.

   [TODO: provide guidelines for hacking schemas]


6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a template for MILE extensions to the IODEF and
   RID documents; as such, it has no security considerations on its own.

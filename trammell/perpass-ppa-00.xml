  <abstract>

    <t>This document elaborates a threat model for the Perfect Passive
    Adversary (PPA): an adversary with an interest in eavesdropping that can
    passively observe network traffic at every layer at every point in the
    network between the endpoints. It is intended to demonstrate to protocol
    designers and implementors the observability and inferability of
    information and metainformation transported over their respective
    protocols, to assist in the evaluation of the performance of these
    protocols and the effectiveness of their protection mechanisms under
    pervasive passive surveillance.</t>

  <section title="Introduction">
    
    <t>Surveillance is defined in <xref target="RFC6973"/>, Section 5.1.1, as
    "the observation or monitoring of an individual's communications or
    activities". Pervasive passive surveillance is the practice of surveillance
    at widespread observation points, without any modification of network
    traffic, and without any particular surveillance target in mind. Pervasive
    passive surveillance allows subsequent analysis and inference to be applied
    to the collected data to achieve surveillance aims on a target to be
    identified later, or to analyze general communications patterns and/or
    behaviors without a specified target individual or group.</t>
    
    <t>An analysis of the costs and benefits of pervasive passive surveillance
    is explicitly out of scope of this work; we presume a priori that
    communications systems should aim to provide appropriate privacy guarantees
    to their users, and that such pervasive surveillance is therefore a bad
    thing. Therefore, susceptibility to pervasive surveillance should avoided
    as a design goal in protocol design. From these assumptions we take the
    very act of pervasive surveillance to be adversarial by definition.</t>
    
    <t>This document outlines a threat model for an entity performing pervasive
    passive surveillance, termed the Perfect Passive Adversary (PPA), and
    explores how to apply this model to the evaluation of protocols. As the
    primary threat posed by pervasive surveillance is a threat to the privacy
    of the parties to a given communication, this document is heavily based on
    <xref target="RFC6973"/>.</t>

          <t hangText="Observation: ">Information collected directly from
          communications by an eavesdropper or observer. For example, the

          accessed by a given IP address, by comparing the size in octets of
          measured network flow records to fingerprints derived from known
          sizes of linked resources on the web servers involved would be an
          inference.</t>

  <section title="The Perfect Passive Adversary">
    
      <t>The perfect passive adversary (PPA) is an eavesdropper that can
      potentially observe every packet of all communications at any or every
      hop in a network path between the outward-facing network interface of the
      last trusted machine in the initiator's administrative domain and the
      recipient, but can take no other action with respect to these
      communications. Limiting the adversary to being completely passive may
      under-represent the threat to communications privacy posed especially by
      well-resourced adversaries, but represents well the maximum capability of
      a single entity whose surveillance is undetectable without physically
      securing the entire network path. We also assume that the PPA does not
      have unlimited resources, i.e., that it will attempt to eavesdrop at the
      most efficient observation point available to it, and will collect as
      little raw data as necessary to support its aims.</t>

      <t>We explicitly assume the PPA does not have the ability to compromise
      trusted systems at either the initiator or a recipient of a
      communication. Indeed, if the adversary is cooperating with one of the
      communications endpoints, there is no guidance to give to protocol
      designers that would improve the privacy and security of the individual
      at the other endpoint: the compromise is then truly out of the scope of
      the communication enabled by the protocol.</t>
          
      <t>We further assume the PPA does not have priviliged information
      allowing the reversal of encryption, e.g. compromised key material or
      knowledge of weaknesses in the design or implementation of cryptographic
      algorithms at the initiator, recipient, and/or intermediaries. While
      these risks do exist in the real world, the threat model is simplified if
      we presume that a given cryptographic protection for a protocol works as
      advertised.</t>
      
      <t>The tools available to the PPA are therefore direct observation and
      inference. Direct observation involves taking information directly from
      eavesdropped communications - e.g., URLs identifying content or email
      addresses identifying individuals from application-layer headers.
      Inference, on the other involves analyzing eavesdropped information to
      derive new information from it; e.g., searching for application or
      behavioral fingerprints in observed traffic to derive information about
      the observed individual from them, in absence of directly-observed
      sources of the same information.</t>

  </section>
  
  <section title="Threat analysis">
      
      <t>On initial examination, the PPA would appear to be trivially
      impossible to defend against. If the PPA has access to every byte of
      every packet of a communication, then full application payload and
      content is available. Guidance to protocol designers to provide
      cryptographic protection of confidentiality in their protocols (e.g.,
      through the use of <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> at the transport
      layer and <xref target="RFC3851">S/MIME</xref> end-to-end) improves this
      situation somewhat, but metadata such as source and destination IP
      addresses and ports are still available to allow correlation and
      association of communications. Protocols that route messages based on
      recipient identifier or pseudonym, such as <xref
      target="RFC2821">SMTP</xref> and <xref target="RFC6120">XMPP</xref>,
      still require intermediate systems to handle these. If each hop of the
      communication is not secured, these identifiers may be available to an
      eavesdropper.</t>
      
      <t>Assuming that the PPA's resources are not unlimited allows us to back
      away from this worst-case scenario. Storing full packet information for a
      fully-loaded 10 Gigabit Ethernet link will fill one 4TB hard disk (the
      largest commodity hard disk available as of this writing) in less than an
      hour; storing network flow data from the same link, e.g. as <xref
      target="RFC5655">IPFIX Files</xref>, requires on the order of 1/1000 the
      storage (i.e., 4GB an hour). Flow-based surveillance approaches, which
      store only communications metadata, are therefore more scalable for
      pervasive surveillance, so it is worthwhile to analyze information which
      can be inferred from various network traffic capture and analysis
      techniques other than full packet capture.</t>

      <t>In the remainder of this analysis, we list kinds of information which
      can be directly observed and those which can be used for inference
      through e.g. fingerprinting. The former group may seem somewhat obvious,
      but are included for completeness.</t>

    <t>[EDITOR'S NOTE: General guidance: end-to-end encryption when possible.
    Apply unlinked pseudonyms for message routing on envelopes around
    end-to-end encrypted content.]</t>
    
    <t>[EDITOR'S NOTE: General guidance: Fingerprinting can rely on packet and
    flow size information; the inclusion of null information in packets, or
    grouping information into more/fewer packets can reduce this risk at the
    expense of usable bandwidth; though this is implementation guidance,
    protocols should make it possible do to dhis. Similarly, fingerprinting can
    rely on inter-packet timing information: injecting delay into packet
    transmission can reduce this risk at the expense of latency.]</t>

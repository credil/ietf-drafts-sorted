1.  Terminology

   This document uses terms from [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] and
   [RFC3428].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The SIP MESSAGE method [RFC3428] is used for page-mode messaging.  In
   page mode, each individual message is sent independently and not as
   part of any session.  On the other hand, there are session-mode text
   messaging standards such as the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
   [RFC4975] and Real Time Text (RTT) [RFC5194] where every message is
   part of a session with a definite start and end.  Which mode to use
   in an emergency depends on what the endpoint is capable of.

   This document describes how the SIP MESSAGE method is used to support
   emergency text messaging within the framework described in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework].  The existing framework does not consider
   methods that do not create a session or are not a part of it.  The
   main difference between the existing framework and the MESSAGE
   approach is in the way the proxies handle SIP MESSAGE methods.

   This document assumes that the Emergency Services network (ESInet)
   and PSAPs are SIP-based infrastructures.  However, the caller-facing
   access network may or may not be IP based.  Emergency messages may be
   sent end-to-end using the SIP MESSAGE method, or it may be in a
   different format and protocol in the caller side and have to be
   converted to SIP MESSAGE somewhere along the path towards the call
   taker.  Therefore, we also describe recommendations on how a SIP
   MESSAGE is formed from non-SIP text protocols.

   Presence is beyond the scope of this document.

                       Figure 1: Emergency Text Flow

   Emergency text communication may utilize SIP MESSAGE end-to-end from
   the caller's end device or application to the call taker, or may
   start as another form of text messaging scheme such as SMS but
   ultimately be converted to a SIP MESSAGE.  Text handling after the
   conversion is the same.  In any case, the MESSAGE request is
   constructed as described in [RFC3428].  The body of the request
   contains the message to be delivered.  Then the values for various
   emergency header fields are filled as stated in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework].  If the location information is appended
   to the body of the request, the caller's message and the location
   information must be inserted into the body of the request as multiple
   MIME attachments.  These are explained in more detail in Section 4.

   The main difference of this approach from both the traditional SIP
   MESSAGE routing and the emergency framework is in the way the MESSAGE
   is handled along the path.  In emergency handling, the path that the
   first MESSAGE request takes is important.  Subsequent MESSAGE
   requests from the same person or device must follow the same path as
   the first one so that they are delivered correctly to the same call
   taker.  Otherwise, if subsequent MESSAGE requests are delievered to
   another call taker or another PSAP, there will be considerable
   confusion for both the sender and the receiver.  Therefore, the path
   of the first MESSAGE request is determined by location and/or local
   policy, but all subsequent MESSAGE requests must follow the path of
   the first request regardless of location or local policy.

   This means that entities within the path that determine the next hop
   based on location or local policy need to keep track of MESSAGE
   requests that it forwards.  Emergency Service Routing Proxy
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] is an example of such entity.  How such
   proxy behaves is described in Section 5.  However, this behavior is
   not confined to proxies.  SIP UAs and call distributing entities
   within the PSAPs are also affected.  If the SIP UA does not keep
   track of MESSAGE requests, then it would query LoST [RFC5222]

   everytime a MESSAGE is sent.  This is a big problem if the caller is
   moving while sending messages.  The SIP UA may send the MESSAGE
   requests to different PSAPs.  Call distributing entities need to keep
   track of MESSAGE requests so that requests from one caller is
   forwarded consistently to one call taker.  For these entities, the
   same state-keeping mechanisms described in Section 5 can be used.

   When the call taker sends a reply to the caller, the application
   constructs a SIP MESSAGE request without location or other special
   header fields used in emergency and sends it towards the caller.  The
   reply follows the normal SIP routing path.  If the caller's original
   message was not SIP, then the replies from call taker must also be
   converted from SIP MESSAGE request to the original message format and
   tranport protocol.  As an example, if the caller's original message
   was an SMS message, then the call taker's reply may have to be
   converted to an SMS message so that the caller can receive it on his/
   her cell phone.  There may be other protocols, such as proprietary IM
   protocols, that may need conversion.  Gateways, such as the SMS
   gateway shown in Figure 1, handles these conversions.  Conversion is
   described in Section 6.


4.  Caller UAC Processing

   Caller UAC follows the rules of SIP MESSAGE [RFC3428] and those of
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework].  The following description of caller UAC
   processing is derived from the union of the two documents mentioned
   earlier.

   The UAC may include location information in the body as type "xml/
   pidf-lo" with a corresponding Geolocation header field, or include a
   reference to the location information in the Geolocation header field
   as specified in [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance].  In the former
   case, the UAC needs to include both the sender's message and the
   location information in one body.  To do so, the UAC must use
   multipart MIME.  Here is an example:

   The UAC should resolve the location to a URI by querying LoST
   [RFC5222] and should include the URI in the Route header field.  This
   should be done only once in the beginning of conversation to make
   sure all subsequent MESSAGE requests follow the same next-hop as the
   first request.  If the UAC is not able to resolve the location, then
   it should not include a Route header field.

   It is out of the scope of this document to decide when the
   conversation begins or ends.  The UAC may use a user-interface-based
   approach for this, i.e., start a new conversation when the user opens
   a new chat window, and then terminate the conversation when the user
   closes that window.  However, this is only an example.

   If the UAC receives a non-200 response, it should notify the sender
   of the response and give the sender the option of dialing the
   emergency number instead of sending another MESSAGE request.


5.  Proxy Processing

   As described in Section 3, proxies that determine the next hop of an
   emergency request based on location or local policy need to keep
   track of MESSAGE requests it handles.  On the other hand, proxies
   that foward MESSAGE requests based on the To header field or the
   Route header field do not need to keep track since the MESSAGE
   requests will be delivered consistently.

   The proxies that need to track MESSAGE requests, e.g., the Emergency
   Services Routing Proxy [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework], MUST perform
   additional record keeping for MESSAGE requests if all of the
   following conditions are met.

   1.  The destination (obtained from the To header field) is
       urn:service:sos.

   2.  This is the first MESSAGE from a particular source (obtained from
       the From header field).  In other words, the proxy has no record
       of the source sending a MESSAGE to urn:service:sos.

   The record is a (source, next-hop, expiration timer) triplet.  The
   source is obtained from the From header field of the request.  The
   next-hop is determined by a LoST query [RFC5222] based on the
   location information or a reference to the location information
   within the first request.  Location information in subsequent
   requests do not affect the next-hop value.  The expiration timer is a
   value in seconds that will keep the record from expiring.  Each
   subsequent request resets the expiration timer.  For example, if the
   configured value of the expiration timer is 30 seconds, then the
   countdown begins after the first request is processed.  When the
   second request comes in, the expiration timer is reset to 30 seconds
   and the countdown starts again.  If the timer falls to zero, the
   record is no longer valid.

   Proxies route all subsequent MESSAGE request from the same source to
   the same next-hop while the expiration timer is greater than zero.

   Each subsequent MESSAGE request resets the expiration timer to its
   maximum value.  This is to ensure that a 'conversation' between the
   caller and the call taker is consistent.


6.  Conversion to SIP MESSAGE

   The original message may not be SIP.  It may be an SMS message or an
   IM message in a proprietary format and protocol.  In these cases, the
   original format and protocol must be converted to a SIP MESSAGE.

   The following is the minimum information needed to convert a non-SIP
   message to a valid SIP MESSAGE.

   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Type of      | Correspoding SIP MESSAGE element                   |
   | Information  |                                                    |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Origination  | From header field                                  |
   | address or   |                                                    |
   | number       |                                                    |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | User message | In the body as type "text/plain"                   |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Location     | Geolocation header field and in the body as type   |
   | information  | "xml/pidf-lo" (Geolocation header field only if    |
   |              | conveying location by reference)                   |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+

   The SIP URI for the From header field must be created by merging the
   origination address or number and the IP address and port of the
   converting entity.  For example, let's say the origination address or
   number is 123-456-7890 and the IP address and port number of the
   converting entity is 128.59.19.184:5060.  Then the SIP URI should be
   sip:1234567890@128.59.19.184:5060.

   The To header field must contain an emergency string such as
   "urn:service:sos".  The destination address or number, e.g., 9-1-1,
   in the original non-SIP message is retained and carried along with
   the SIP message in the History-Info header [RFC4244].  The
   destination address could be useful in post incident call analysis
   for PSAP personnel to identify network issues such as mis-routed text
   messages allowing more efficient trouble clearing with the
   appropriate network provider.

   The next hop entity should be determined by quering LoST with the
   provided location information and it should be included in the Route
   header field.

   If the converter receives a 200 OK response, it should send a success
   indicator to the original sender.  There may not be a one-to-one
   match between SIP responses and the original protocol, especially
   when non-200 responses are received.  In this case, the converter
   must indicate failure and may send the reason text as a message to
   the sender.

   The call taker's reply, which is another SIP MESSAGE request in the
   reverse direction, should be sent to the origination address or
   number in its original format.  The origination address or number can
   be extracted from the To header field.  The From header field may
   contain "urn:service:sos", in which case it must be replaced with the
   original emergency number or string.

   If the sender protocol allows provisional and final responses, the
   converter should make use of them to indicate the status of the call
   taker.  For example, the converter should send a 202 Accepted
   response upon receiving the call taker's MESSAGE, and then a 200 OK
   upon receiving the final success indication from the sender.  If the
   sender protocol does not allow such elaborate responses, the
   converter must send a 200 OK upon receiving the call taker's MESSAGE.

Internet-Draft      ABNF Extension for code generation     November 2009

Abstract

   This document describes an ABNF extension for code generation. ABNF
   has been widely used for decades. While its popurarity is ascribed to
   its simplicity and ease of use,  the demand for code generation
   has been fulfilled only marginally, by some sort of non-standard
   extensions, or by conversion to yet another meta language. One
   possible solution is to add more detailed specifications to the
   existing ABNF standard, but this hurts the very competitiveness of
   ABNF itself.  Another solution is to standardize an extension and
   make it a 'sister' standard in parallel to the existing ABNF
   standaard.  In this document we propose such an extension as a
   standard. The generated code using the proposed extension would be
   "complete", meaning no need to modify by hand, if there exist no
   concepts of unordered groups in the specification.

Internet-Draft      ABNF Extension for code generation     November 2009


1.   Introduction

   ABNF, Augmented BNF(Backus-Naur Form) has been widely used for
   Internet specifications, ranging from Voice Over IP, instant messaging
   clients and multimedia players to HTTP servers and proxies. Internet
   specifications involve processing network protocol messages. A key
   part of this processing is to decode(parse) messages as they are
   received from the network, and to encode attributes into messages.
   As message decoding/encoding represent the front line of interaction
   between the application and the outside world, the correctness of
   decoding/encoding is crucial. While, hand-written(fully or partially)
   network message processing code has been dominant, there have been
   ABNF code generators to address hand coding problems.  Their success
   is only marginal, though. The main reason is the fact that complete
   codec code cannot be generated from a sophisticated specification
   like SIP due to the absense of detailed inforamtion required to
   generate code. Existing code generators often generate incomplete bare
   minimum code or require the ABNF specification to be translated into
   another meta language with additional detailed information.
   In the light of these observations, we propose an extension for code
   generation.  Directvies necessary to generate code is added to an
   existing ABNF specification as an Extension Rule, using a special
   token ";--".  Along with Extension Rules, some restrictions and
   limitations are applied to the ABNF specifications. The size of a
   variable in the generated code is limited by the language and th
   platform, as in most languages.


2. Restrictions on ABNF for code generation

   ABNF is a meta language and an ABNF specification does not specify
   capacity limits for variables. However, the target language which
   the specification is generated into, has limited ranges for variables.
   For instace, in ABNF, the repetition directive *, means from 0 to
   infinity.  The "infinity" is interpreted the largest number the
   target language allows. 

   The extension we propose, is an add-on, not modifying the ABNF
   standard, however, some straightforward conversions facilitate code
   generation, 


2.1. Rule Termination
   A rule should be terminated by ";" or ";--X" for an extension rule
        The string from ";" to CRLF is regarded as a comment
        The string from ";--X" to CRLF is regarded as an extension rule

Internet-Draft      ABNF Extension for code generation     November 2009


2.2. Limit on value length
    In case of bin-val, dec-val and hex-val, the maximum length of 
    concatenation is 80

2.3. Maximum Repetition
   The maximum value of unlimited repetitions is the size of one word 
   of the most popular CPU i.e 2^32.
        So *(SP|HT) can occur 0 - (2^32-1) times.

2.4. Character Range
   A character value should be ranged 0 - 255
        ex) 0x01-0xfc : OK
        0x01-0xffcc : Not OK

2.5. Optional value conversion for alternation elements
   An optional element in alternation should be converted.
   For instance, the rule "A = B / C [D] / E" should be converted to:
        "A = B / X/  E where X = C [D]"

2.6. Rulename Conversion
   In ABNF, the identifier "rulename" may contain the minus character
   '-' in any place, but the first. On the other hand, most popular
   network programing languages do not allow the minus character in
   their identifier.  Therefore, any minus characters in rulenames
   need to be removed. For example, message-header would be converted
   to MsgHdrList.


3. Extension Rule ;--XRule

   For the code generator to generate code, the following information
   is needed to be added to the ABNF spefecifications.
   
   * Whether or not to generate code from the rule.
   * Which parts to be generated from the rule
   * Data type to be used
   * Choices for a choice data type
   * Bit Operation Directives
   
   The above directive information is added at the end of an ABNF rule,
   as an Extension Rule.  An Extension Rule is specified using ;--X.
   Appendix B lists a registry of Extension Rules.

   Each Rule has the reference index 0, and indexes on its right hand 
   side start from 1. For instance, Rule_A in the following can be
   referenced as 0, and elem_1 as 1, etc.

   Rule_A = elem_1 elem_2 .. elem_l .. elem_n
            ;--XtensionRule elem_index_m ..

   Alternation and repeater do not have an index value.


3.1.   XPDU
   XPDU indicates that the rule performs encoding or decoding a PDU, so
   codec code is generated for the rule.
   Synopsis:
      ;--XPDU
   Example:
      SIPMessage    =  StartLine MsgHdrList ;--XPDU
      SessionDescription = ProtoVersion .... ;--XPDU

3.2.   XCUT
   XCUT is used to cut unnecessary parts when the struct type name is
   code-generated.
   Synopsis:
      ;--XCUT [<idx> *(, <idx>)]
      where <idx> is the index number of an element.
        It does not have any relation with decoding rules.
        If <idx> is 0, then it means "cutting out" the rule, and
        the rule does not get generated in the user header file
   Example:
      HostPort     =  Host [ ":" Port ] ;--XCUT 3
        ==> Cutting out ":" which not to be decoded into a variable
      Hdrs         =  "?" Hdr *( "&" Hdr ) ;--XCUT 1,4
        ==> Cutting out "?" and "&"


3.3.   XTYPE
   XTYPE is used to specify the data type for the rule.
   If XTYPE is absent, the struct type is used by default.
   Synopsis:
      ;--XTYPE [<idx>=<type name> *(, <idx> = <type name>)]
      where <idx> is the index number of an element.
      and <typename> is one of structl, struct, uint, ushort, char*,
      char, uchar, enum, octet(num), octet, char(num), objId, bit,
      float, boolean, null or char*esc.

     The following typenames are used only (idx=0) TYPE:
              structl, struct, octet(num), octet, objid, bit, enum
      whareas the following  is used only (idx>0) TYPE :
               null

      Each typename is described below.

  structl
     This type name is used to generate linked struct types.

     Example:
         UriPrms = 1*( ";" UriPrm)
            ;--XTYPE 0=structl.
       From the above ABNF definition, something like following can be
       generated.
         typedef struct UriPrms_ {
            struct UriPrms_*        next;
            UriPrm                  value;
        } *UriPrms;

  struct
     This type name is used to generate struct types.

     char*, uint, ushort, char, uchar, enum, char(number), float,
     and boolean. Their namesake types in C is type-defined by the rule
     names.
     Examples:
          HdrStr           =  1*( HnvUnreserved / Unreserved / Escaped )
                            ;--XTYPE 0=char*

          BasicTrspPrm    = "udp" / "tcp" / "sctp" / "tls"
                            ;--XTYPE 0=enum

  bit
     This type name is used to define a string of zero or more bits,
     and identical to ASN.1 BIT STRING.

     Example:
         NotifyCompletionReason = (TimeOutToken
                                    / InterruptByEventToken
                                    / InterruptByNewSignalsDescrToken
                                    / OtherReasonToken)
                ;--XTYPE 0=bit
                ;--XVAR 2=onTimeOut, 3=onInterruptByEvent,
                ;--XVAR 4=onInterruptByNewSignalDescr, 5=otherReason

         From the above ABNF definition, something like following can
         be generated.      

                typedef unsigned char NotifyCompletion;
                #define onTimeOut 0x80
                #define onInterruptByEvent 0x40
                #define onInterruptByNewSignalDescr 0x20
                #define otherReason 0x10

   null
     The type name is mapped to a null type and cannot be assigned to
     the 0'th index which is the rule itself.

     Example:
         TransactionReply = ReplyToken EQUAL TransactionID LBRKT
                                   [ ImmAckRequiredToken COMMA]
                                   TransactionResult RBRKT
                      ;--XCUT 1,2,4,7,9
                      ;--XVAR 3=transactionId, 6=immAckRequired, 
                              8=transactionResult
                      ;--XTYPE 6=null

       From the above ABNF definition, something like following can be
       generated.      
                typedef Nulltype char;
                typedef struct TransactionReply {
                    unsigned char bit_mask;
                    # define immAckRequired_present 0x80
                   TransactionId transactionId;
                   Nulltype immAckRequired;
                   TransactionResult transactionResult;
              } TransactionReply;

   octet(len)
      This type name is used to define a string whose length is the
      given len.  
            
      Example:
         TStr = TokenChar 0*TokenEChar ;--XTYPE 0=octet(40)
         It can be generated into C something like:
            typedef struct TStr {
                    unsigned short  length;
                    unsigned char value[40];
            } TStr;

   octet
        This type name is used to define an 8-bit string.
      Example:
         Username =  1*(%x21-7E/%x80-FF) ;--XTYPE 0=octet

        It can be generated into C something like:

           typedef struct Username {
                  unsigned short  length;
                  unsigned char*    value;

          } Username;

   char*esc
      This type name is used when a hex-digit value is mapped to an
      ASCII character. For instance, "%61lice" is mapped to "alice"
      using the following example definition.

      Example:
           UserInfo    = 1*(%x21-3F / %x41-FF) "@"
                        ;--XCUT 4
                        ;--XTYPE 0=char*esc

           This can be generated to:
                 typedef char* UserInfo;

3.4.   XVAR
   This extension rule is used to assign variable names and values.
   Synopsis:
        ;-XVAR <idx>=<nameVal> *(, <idx>=<nameVal>)
   Example:
      BaseNettype = "IN" / "ATM" / "LOCAL"
          ;--XTYPE 0=enum
          ;--XVAR 1=BNType_IN, 2=BNType_ATM, 3=BNType_LOCAL

3.5.   XCHOICE
   XCHOICE is used with alternations to generate into a C structured type
   containing an integer for the choice tag value followed by a union of
   all of the equivalent types that make up the XCHOICE elements.

   Synopsis:
        ;--XCHOICE <idx>=<nameVal> *(, <idx>=<nameVal>)
        The namdId is simply a sequential number starting at one for each
        alternative in the XCHOICE. A #define constant is generated for
        each of these values. 
   Examples:
      HierPartNoPrms        = "/" (NetPathNoPrms / AbsPathNoPrms)
         ;--XCUT 1
         ;--XCHOICE 3=HierPartNP_mNet_chosen, 4=HierPartNP_mAbs_chosen

      UserPrm = "user=" ( BasicUserPrm / Token )
        ;--XCUT 1
        ;--XNCASE 1
        ;--XVAR 4=mOtherUserPrm
        ;--XALT 4
        ;--XCHOICE 3=UserPrm_mBasic_chosen, 4=UserPrm_mOther_chosen

      This can be generated to:

        typedef struct UserPrm {
           xu16            choice;
        #  define  UserPrm_mBasic_chosen   1
        #  define  UserPrm_mOther_chosen   2
           union {
              BasicUserPrm            mBasicUserPrm;

3.6.   XBITMASK
   This extension rule is used to assign bitmask names and values.
   Synopsis:
        ;--XBITMASK <idx>=<nameVal> *(, <idx>=<nameVal>)
        short bitmask selection method
        full bitmask name : typename_variablename_present
        short bitmask name : vairablename_present
   Example:
      Accept                  = 0*1AcceptValue CRLF
                                ;--XCUT 2
                                ;--XBITMASK 1=Accept_mPld_present

      This can be generated to:

      typedef struct Accept {
        xu8             bit_mask;
      #               define  Accept_mPld_present     0x80
        struct AcceptValue_*    mAcceptValue;    /* optional */
      } Accept;


3.7.   XTDEF
   This is used to do a typedef in C.
   It should not be used with the structl type name
   Synopsis:
        ;--XTDEF <idx>
   Example:
         AddRequest = AddToken EQUAL AmmRequest
                     ;--XCUT 1,2
                     ;--XTDEF 3
         Then, the following code is generated:
               typedef AmmRequest AddRequest


3.8.   XNCASE
   Used to direct case-insensitivity, when strings compared.
   Synopsis:
        ;--XNCASE <idx> *(, <idx>)
   Example:
      BasicTrspPrm    = "udp" / "tcp" / "sctp" / "tls"
                      ;--XTYPE 0=enum
                      ;--XNCASE 1,2,3,4

3.9.  XDUP
   Used to specify byte values which the compiler can take.

   Synopsis:
        ;--XDUP <idx>=<hex-digit> *(, <hex-digit>)
   Example :
        CallId = ( "Call-ID" / "i" ) HCOLON Payload CRLF
                     ;--XCUT 2,3,4,6
                     ;--XNCASE 2,3
                     ;--XTDEF 5
                     ;--XDUP 3=0x20,0x09,0x3a
        Then, the following code can be generated:
               typedef Payload CallId
               typedef struct Payload {
                   xu16                   length;
                   xu8*                   value;
               } Payload;

3.10.  XALT
   This extension rule is used to assign a fall-back option
   Synopsis:
         ;--XALT <idx>
         where <idx> is the index number of an element.
   Example :
         Host = Ipv4 / Ipv6 / HostName
                    ;--XALT 3
         HostName =  1*(Alphanum / "-"/ "." )
                    ;--XTYPE 0=char


3.11.  XSTRL
   This is used to appoint a char as delimiter if there exists no
   delimiter when one is needed.
   Synopsis:
       ;--XSTRL <idx> = <byte> *(, <byte>)
       where <idx> is the index number of an element and <byte> is a
       hex-digit.
   Example :
     ExtHdrList = 1*(ExtHdr)
      ;--XTYPE 0=structl
      ;--XSTRL 2=0x21,0x23-27,0x2a-2b,0x2d-2e,0x30-39,0x41-5a,0x5e-7a,
         0x7c,0x7e
      ;In this case, it specifies all the character suitable for ExtHdr
         = Token
                 ;
      ExtHdr = Token HCOLON 0*1Payload CRLF
                 ;--XCUT 2,4
                 ;--XVAR 1=mHdrName, 3=mHdrValue

3.12.  XNRPT
   Extension data are used as a general rule, when pre-conditions are
   not met. If extension data use XSTRL for its structl type, it's
   necessary to check if the pre-conditions are met by setting XNRPT
   to 1. The following example shows that once ExtHdr is met, there is
   a chance for it to continue to be met. To avoid this situation,
   it's forced to check Exthdr only after Acceptlist and ViaList are
   checked.
   Synopsis:
       ;--XNRPT <idx>
       where <idx> is the index number.
   Example :
      MsgHdrList   = *{ 0*1AcceptList
                        ViaList
                        0*1ExtHdrList
                      } CRLF
      ExtHdrList = 1*(ExtHdr)
                    ;--XTYPE 0=structl
                    ;--XSTRL 2=0x41-5A,0x61-7A,0x30-39,0x2d,0x2e,0x21
                                 ,0x25, 0x2a,0x5f,0x2b,0x60,0x27,0x7e
                      ;--XNRPT 1
      ExtHdr = Token HCOLON Payload CRLF
                      ;--XCUT 2,4
                      ;--XVAR 1=mHdrName, 3=mHdrValue

3.13.  XFENC
   This extension rule is used when a variable needs to be overriden
   with a given value.
   Synopsis:
       ;--XFENC <idx> = <value>
   where <idx> is the index number of an elemnt and <value> is a number.
   Example:
      HCOLON  =  *( SP / HTAB ) ":" 0*1LWS ;--XCUT 0
                            ;--XFENC 5=0x20
      LWS = [*WSP CRLFLWS] 1*WSP ;--XCUT 0

3.14.  XNLCMP
   This extension rule is used when the length in PDU rule and the
   size of the input stream are not to be compared.
   Synopsis:
       ;--XNLCMP
   Example:
       SIPMessage = StartLine MsgHdrList
                         ;--XPDU
       StartLine  = *CRLF (StatusLine / ReqLine)
                     ;--XNLCMP
                     ;--XCUT 1
                     ;--XALT 4
                     ;--XCHOICE 3=SL_mStatus_chosen, 4=SL_mReq_chosen

3.15.  XMANDA
   This extension is used for a special case where elements can come in
   an arbitray order and some of them are mandatory. As seen in the 
   example below, the message-header in RFC 3261 contains some 
   mandatory elements and other optional elements. All its elements are
   specified as optional in ABNF, and in the text, some of the elements
   are further specified as mandatory. Using this XMANDA extension rule,
   its ABNF can include the further specification. 

   Synopsis:
       ;--XMANDA <idx> *(, <idx>)
       where <idx> is an index number
   Example :
      Request    =  Request-Line  MsgHdrList
          ;--XPDU
      MsgHdrList   =  *(     Accept 
                           / CallId
                           / Accept-Encoding
                           / To
                           / From
                           / Accept-Language
                           / ViaList
                           ...
                       ) CRLF   ;--XMANDA 3,5,6
     As specified by XMANDA, its 3rd, 5th, and 6th elements i.e. CallId,
     To, and From, are processed as manadatory by the code generater

1. Introduction 

   This document defines a new media type for TimeStampedData envelopes. 
   A TimeStampedData envelope, described in [RFC5544], binds a file with 
   one or more time-stamp tokens obtained for that file.  A media type 
   registration, lacking in [RFC5544], enhances shareability. 

2. Registration 

   Type name: application 

   Subtype name: timestamped-data 

   Required parameters: none 

   Optional parameters: none 

   Encoding considerations: binary 

   Security considerations: 

      See the Security considerations in the published specification. 

   Interoperability considerations: none 

   Published specification: RFC 5544 

   Applications which use this media type: 

      Any application that exchanges TimeStampedData envelopes over a 
      MIME-based transport and possibly processes them, either directly 
      or via external handlers or viewers. Such applications may be, for

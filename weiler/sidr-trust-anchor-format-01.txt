Internet-Draft          RPKI Trust Anchor Format               July 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a convention for distributing and using trust
   anchors for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  It
   assumes a working knowledge of the RPKI.  [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch]

   The trust anchor has two parts: a URI of a self-signed certificate
   and a copy of the public key from that certificate.  Neither part of
   the trust anchor directly lists the resources for which the
   certificate is authoritative.  Instead, that list is stored in the
   certificate itself, which allows the list of resources to change
   without changing the trust anchor.

1.1.  Terminology

   RFC5280 and RFC5914 define the term "trust anchor" slightly
   differently than it is used here.  In particular, those definitions
   do not include an external pointer such as the URI used in this
   format.

   The broader security literature, however, uses the term "trust
   anchor" to refer to something (relatively) static.  In this case, the
   certificate pointed to by the URI contains a dynamic list of
   resources in the RFC3779 extensions, which makes the certificate
   unstable.

   While acknowledging the slight differences from the RFC5280 and
   RFC5914 definitions, we choose to use the term "trust anchor" in a
   way that is more consistent with the broader literature and which we
   find more intuitive.


2.  Format Details

   The URI part of the trust anchor is an rsync URI.  See [RFC5781].
   The URI is followed by a CRLF.

   The key part is a base64 encoded, DER-encoded X.509
   subjectPublicKeyInfo.  See [RFC5280].

3.  Usage

   To use one of these trust anchors, a relying party (RP):

   1.  Retrieves the object referenced by the URI.
   2.  Checks that the received object is a valid, self-signed X.509
       certificate with [RFC3779] extensions conforming to the profile
       described in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].
   3.  Extracts the public key from the X.509 certificate.
   4.  Compares the public key from the trust anchor to the key from the
       certificate.  If they don't match, the trust anchor is invalid.


4.  Operational Considerations

   When creating a certificate which will be referenced by a trust
   anchor, several constraints apply:

   1.  It must conform to the profile described in
       [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].
   2.  It must be self-signed.
   3.  It must use a stable key.  When reissuing the certificate,
       whether because the list of resources changes, or renewal, or for
       any other reason, the same key must be reused in the new
       certificate.
   4.  It must be published at a stable URI.  When the certificate is
       reissued, the replacement must be accessible using the same URI.

   If the issuer of a trust anchor wants to keep the private key
   corresponding to the self-signed certificate off-line, that can be
   easily done by delegating all of the resources in the certificate to
   a single child certificate and issuing all relevant certificates
   under the child.

   OPEN ISSUE: should this document mandate the use of a second tier CA
   cert?

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies no IANA Actions.


6.  Security Considerations

   This trust anchor format does not directly provide a list of
   resources covered by the certificate.  Instead, the relying party is
   referred to the certificate itself.  This provides necessary
   operational flexibility, but it also allows the certificate issuer to
   claim to be authoritative for any resource.  Relying parties should
   either have great confidence in the issuers of certificates that
   they're configuring as trust anchors, or they should issue their own
   self-signed certificate as a trust anchor and, in doing so, impose
   constraints on the child certificates.  For more information on this
   approach, see [I-D.reynolds-rpki-ltamgmt].

                Tunnel Type Change for Mobile IPv4 (TTC)

Abstract

   The protocol Mobile IPv4 may use a number of encapsulation methods
   between an MN and its HA.  The UDP method is used to perform NAT
   Traversal (if a NAT sits between MN and HA) whereas IP-in-IP method
   may be used if there is no NAT (CoA is a publicly routable address).
   Although these methods are individually specified, a mechanism for
   changing between one to another is not, which may lead to incoherent
   implementations.

   This draft briefly presents the scenario of a MN performing a
   handover between private space (NAT) and public space (non-NAT), the
   implementation problem (type of tunnel can not be changed
   dynamically), and some potential solutions as textual modifications,
   better implementations, or protocol extensions.

2.  Introduction

   Dynamically changing the type of a tunnel interface is an
   implementation difficulty which appeared during an experimentation of
   typical vehicular networks.  The protocol Mobile IPv4 and extensions
   for traversal of NAT devices, as well as network mobility extensions
   are used.

   In this draft we describe a scenario of a moving network in a public
   transportation vehicle.  The vehicle successively connects to two
   different types of wireless access networks (WiFi and 3G+), by
   performing automatic handovers, without affecting the sessions run on
   passenger devices.

   The problem arising in some existing implementations of Home Agent
   (not supporting dynamic change of the tunnel type) is further
   explained.  Also, a brief analysis of RFC texts describing Mobile
   IPv4 and IP-in-UDP is performed, potentially giving way for a new
   mechanism for dynamic Tunnel Type Change to accommodate handovers
   between private and public space.

   Several solutions are proposed to alleviate this problem.  In one
   solution, only behaviour is modified (software implementation at MR
   and HA); in another, existing messages are exchanged differently
   (deletion prior to new registration); finally, a new message format
   may be proposed to solve this problem.

3.  Scenario and Problem

   The scenario relates to the use of Internet in vehicles of public
   transportation.  A bus of the RATP public transportation agency of
   the City of Paris is equipped with special Routers and wireless
   access hardware.  The bus offers stable WiFi access to passengers.
   While moving around, it successively connects to two different
   wireless access systems available on its trajectory: WiFi of operator
   Naxos (private space) and 3G+ of operator Orange (public space).  The
   router equipment within the vehicle performs automatic handovers
   between these two wireless access systems, depending on coverage and
   signal strength.  Thanks to the use of standard Mobile IP and
   software enhancements implemented in the Router, the connectivity
   events occuring on the Router are invisible to the passenger
   equipment; put simply, the sessions run by passengers are not
   affected by bus handovers.

   In protocol terms, the scenario consists of a moving network changing
   attachment between a privately addressable IP space and a public
   space.  We consider the co-located Care-of Address mode of Mobile
   IPv4 (not the Foreign Agent mode).

   The moving network is managed by a Mobile Router (a kind of Mobile
   Node) and contains a Local Fixed Node playing the role of passenger
   equipment (e.g. an off-the-shelf laptop running Windows or MacOS).
   Although the LFN runs a typical TCP/IP stack, it does not run IP
   mobility software (LFN does not run Mobile IPv4).  The MR runs the
   typical Mobile IPv4 protocol with NEMOv4 extensions.

   The MR has two distinctive egress physical interfaces to connect to
   WiFi and to 3G+ networks respectively.  The HA is placed in the
   Internet infrastructure and communicates with MR to establish tunnels
   of various types.  LFN is deployed within the moving network and runs
   TCP/IP applications with the Correspondent Node.

   The two relevant topologies for this scenario are illustrated in the
   following two figures.  They depict a handover from public to private
   and from private to public, respectively.

   In this latter figure, the WiFi access offered by the Access Router
   is using a private address space.  It uses DHCP to deliver IP Care-of
   Addresses which are non-routable in the Internet.  On the other hand,
   the SGSN 3G+ wireless access offers IP addresses which are publicly
   routable in the Internet (public space).

   Once connected on WiFi, the MR sends a Registration Request to HA
   indicating establishment of tunnel type encapsulation UDP
   (alternatively, the HA may detect the presence of NAT by simply
   comparing addresses in the RegReq message).  To satisfy this request,
   the HA establishes a virtual interface whose type is IP-in-UDP, such
   that to ease the traversal of the intermediary NAT.  Then, connecting
   on 3G+ provokes the MR to send a RegReq to HA, but this time
   demanding an encapsulation of type IP-in-IP (because if NAT is not
   present, the UDP encapsulation is not necessary).

   The problem stems from the impossibility of the HA to dynamically
   change the encapsulation type of a virtual interface which is already
   established.  Hence, the HA is not able to re-use the previously
   established tunnel and a new virtual interface needs to be
   established.

   In practice (with some HA software implementation), this leads to HA
   not constructing the IP-in-IP virtual interface, or to build

   successively several interfaces for the same Home Address (whereas
   only one is needed).  In other variations, the MR uses one single
   type of encapsulation which may encompass most types of access
   networks: e.g. it may righteously use IP-in-UDP encapsulation on
   private access networks and, unnecessarily, on public access networks
   as well.  This constant use of IP-in-UDP encapsulation works ok on
   public space as well, but involves the use of additional bytes in the
   headers (compared to IP-in-IP) even though UDP is not needed on non-
   NAT networks.

   In the reverse scenario, it is considered that the MR performs a
   handover from public space to private space (from 3G+ to WiFi, in
   other words from non-NAT to NAT).  In this case, if there is no
   change in the type of tunnel - use IP-in-UDP - then the ongoing
   session may be interrupted.

   In specification, when reading RFC5944 "Mobile IPv4", it is not clear
   whether or not the MN is allowed to request dynamically changing the
   type of a tunnel, once a registration is already present at the HA.
   The document does allow the use of various types of encapsulation
   (presumably when no registration present), but it is not clear
   whether a change in type is allowed, or forbidden, once a
   registration is already in place.  Besides, RFC5944 does not specify
   the use of IP-in-UDP.

   Encapsulation of type IP-in-UDP for NAT Traversal when using Mobile
   IP is described in RFC3519 "Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address
   Translation (NAT) Devices".  This document focuses on the use of
   Mobile IP in domains exclusively using NAT.  The document does
   mention the use of IP-in-UDP "when appropriate" which makes think
   that IP-in-UDP may be used alternatively (in a dynamic manner) with
   IP-in-IP encapsulation.

   For example, RFC3519 states that: "When using simultaneous bindings,
   each binding may have a different type (i.e., UDP tunnelling bindings
   may be mixed with non-UDP tunnelling bindings)."

   This may be interpreted as that the intention of RFC3519 is for HA to
   maintain simultaneously multiple tunnels for a unique Home Address
   (for example an IP-in-IP tunnel and a IP-in-UDP tunnel).  If done, in
   some implementation, this leads to a difficulty of the forwarding
   algorithm to choose the outgoing interface, because the distinctive
   factor (Home Address) is the same for the two interfaces.

   In another part of the document RFC3519, it is specified that the HA
   should decline a request to register IP-in-UDP tunnelling when the
   RegReq's addresses match, unless MR uses the F(orce) flag (section
   4.6, page 18).  This behaviour may lead to a behaviour where the MR

   needs to re-require a registration (IP-in-IP this time) or, worse,
   insists on requesting IP-in-UDP although not behind NAT,

   This is illustrated in the following message exchange diagram.
   Initially, the MR is connected on WiFi in private space, and performs
   a handover to 3G+ public space.


          MR                          HA
           |                          |
           |      RegReq UDP          |
           |------------------------->|
           |      RegRep UDP          |
           |<-------------------------|
           |                          |
         --+- - - - - - - - - - - - - +- Handover
           |                          |
           |     RegReq UDP           |
           |------------------------->|
           |     RegRep Decline       |
           |<-------------------------|
           |?                         |
           |       RegReq IP-IP       |
           |------------------------->|
           |       RegRep IP-IP       |
           |<-------------------------|
           |                          |



   By RFC3519, the HA declines the request because it realizes MR is not
   really behind a NAT (the CoA and src addresses in RegReq match).
   However, it has no means to indicate to MR the reason of this
   declination.  The only error code is "64 reason unspecified".  Upon
   reception of this message, the MR is not able to decide whether the
   reason may be a memory exhaustion on HA, wrong security, or simply
   refusal to build IP-in-UDP when not behind NAT.  Hence, it is
   difficult for MR to take appropriate action.

4.  Solutions as Specification and Implementation Changes

   It is possible that the specifications of Mobile IPv4 and NAT
   Traversal to be improved.  It may be possible to be more precise in
   the textual descriptions to cover cases of handover from public to
   private addressing space.  For example, one would specify that the HA
   stores the current type of a tunnel, receives a RegReq, compares the
   tunnel type received to the current, and if change is needed then the
   current tunnel is deleted and a new one is built.

   It is also possible that implementation behaviours on HA and MR are
   simply rendered more intelligent.  They can implement this behaviour
   (dynamically change the tunnel type) without needing any new bit in
   the message formats, hence no protocol extensions.

5.  Trivial Protocol Solution

   Protocol solutions include new uses of existing messages, or the
   addition of new bits in existing message formats and suggest new
   protocol behaviour upon reception of these new bits or when
   generating them.

   A trivial solution to address this problem is to request deletion
   prior to constructing a tunnel of type different than the existing.
   This means that the MR must detect the change in access (from private
   to public, or vice-versa) and first send a Registration Request which
   demands a de-registration of the current binding Home Address -
   Care-of Address.  It then immediately sends a Registration Request
   for the creation of a new binding, with the new tunnel type.

   This solution has been tested successfully with an HA implementation
   which exhibited the said problem of changing the tunnel type.

   In the following figure we illustrate a message exchange showing
   first a Registration Request with type UDP when the MR is attached on
   private space WiFi, followed by a de-registration, and then by a new
   Registration with tunnel type IP-in-IP.

           |      RegReq UDP          |
           |------------------------->|
           |      RegRep UDP          |
           |<-------------------------|

6.  Tunnel Type Change

   A more advanced mechanism - Tunnel Type Change - consists in defining
   new options in the Registration Request indicating that this is a
   type-changing registration (the type of the tunnel must change), as
   illustrated in the following figure:



          MN                          HA
           |                          |
           |       RegReq UDP         |
           |------------------------->|
           |       RegRep UDP         |
           |<-------------------------|
           |                          |
           |                          |
         --+- - - - - - - - - - - - - +- Handover
           |                          |
           |     RegReq TTC IP-IP     |
           |------------------------->|
           |     RegRep TTC IP-IP     |
           |<-------------------------|
           |                          |



   This message exchange is obviously shorter than the trivial mechanism
   presented in the previous section.

   This method requires extensions to the HA software: the HA would have
   to be able to interpret new fields in the RegReq message and
   eventually generate new reply codes.  If we allow modifications to be
   performed on the HA (assume a software implementation effort), then
   it is reasonable to assume that easier implementation would be to
   modify locally the HA (instead of generating new kinds of messages):
   maintain local logic triggering a deletion followed by creation of a
   new tunnel.  It is a subject of further investigation to balance the
   trade-offs between local implementation and message extension.

7.  Security Considerations

   The SPI used for protecting Registration Request could be used for
   protecting also the same message extended for Tunnel Type Change.

8.  Acknowledgements

   The experimentations were performed during the project SEAMLESS
   funded by ANR (Agence Nationale pour la Recherche) of France, lasting
   between 2008 and 2011.  The bus vehicle was kindly provided by Regie
   Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP - leader mondial pour le
   transport public) for several test sorties between September 2010 and
   January 2011.  The 3G+ access by Orange was a typically billed data
   subscription whereas the WiFi access was kindly provided by Naxos for
   test purposes.

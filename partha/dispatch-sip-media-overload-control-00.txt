Abstract

   Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
   SIP servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages
   they receive.  SIP based overload mechanism exists for dedicated SIP
   signaling servers.  But there is a need for overload control solution
   of SIP based media servers like PSTN GW, Session border controllers
   (SBC), Session Recording Server(SRS).  This document summarizes
   problem specific to SIP media servers, requirements for the solution
   of SIP based media overload control.

Internet-Draft    SIP based Media overload control Req      January 2011


1.  Introduction

   In Voice/Video over IP (VoIP) network, Session Initiation protocol
   (SIP) [RFC3261] is widely deployed as a signaling protocol.  There
   are two types SIP servers based on dedicated SIP signaling handling
   and SIP server with media (RTP, T.38) handling.  [RFC5390] provides
   general SIP overload requirement for SIP servers based on User agent,
   Proxy.  SIP overload design consideration
   [I-D.ietf-soc-overload-design] covers dedicated SIP signaling servers
   overload only.

   SIP server with media handling is termed as media servers in this
   document.  Media servers include different application devices namely
   PSTN GW, Session border controllers (SBC), Session Recording
   Server(SRS).  A Media server uses different resources like DSP, DSO,
   disk, memory for handling the media.  Media servers MAY overload due
   to the scarcity of these resources apart from CPU, Memory resource.

   As SIP is used as signaling protocol in media server, the overload
   handling using SIP provides better performance, improved quality of
   service, more control over the media.

   This document summarizes problem specific to SIP media servers,
   requirements for the solution of SIP based media overload control.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs.


3.  Issues in Current SIP based Media server overload mechanism

   488 response code [RFC4412] indicates that UA/B2BUA is not capable of
   handling the specific request.  It does not indicates the overload
   status of the SIP server which leads to servers spend more CPU
   resources in forming negatives response rather than utilizing the
   resource effectively.

   As indicated in [RFC5390], 503 with retry-after header is not
   effective to handle overload.

   [I-D.ietf-soc-overload-design] is designed only for dedicated SIP
   servers and its design is based on number of SIP messages.  The

   capacity of media server mainly depends based on the negotiated media
   type, codec parameters in the session.  For example, the device which
   capable of handling 750 audio calls will be able to handle only 5-10
   telepresence calls.  The overload mechanism based on the number of a
   SIP message is not suitable for media servers.


4.  Topologies

   As mentioned in Sec 6 of [I-D.ietf-soc-overload-design], first three
   topology namely load balancing, multiple source, mesh are applicable
   for Media overload.

   In load balancing topology with media servers, lot of negative
   responses will lead media server to spend more time in generating the
   negative response rather than effectively using the resources.  To
   overcome this issue, Media server has to indicate the overload status
   of the device to upstream entity.

   There is new topology namely Edge B2BUA with media server as follows:

          a--\
              \
          b--\ \--->+---+
              \---->|   |
          c-------->| D |
                    |   |
          ...  /--->+---+
              /
          z--/

                        Edge B2BUA with Mediaserver

   In case Edge B2BUA with mediaserver, B2BUA MUST rejects the new
   request by sending 503 response with retry-after header.


5.  Media server Usecases

   PSTN GW: In case PSTN GW, Media servers generates RTP based on the
   incoming PSTN media information.  DSP, DS0 are external resource
   constraints apart from CPU and memory resource for these devices.

   SBC: Session border controller has two components namely session
   border element (SBE) and data border element (DBE).  DBE performs
   media address hiding, transcoding, transrating, transsizing,and media
   interworking like SRTP to RTP.  DBE uses DSP resources apart from CPU
   & memory.

   SRS: Session Recording Server is used record the session and its
   requirements are mentioned in [I-D.ietf-siprec-req].  SRS uses disk,
   dsp resources apart from CPU, Memory.

   Combination: The above mentioned functionality may be co-exist in the
   same physical device and share the resources.


6.  Solution Requirements

   REQ 1: The mechanism MUST be based on SIP protocol.  Overload occurs
   due to unavailability of any of the resources in the system.

   REQ 2: The mechanism MUST meet all the requirements of [RFC5390].

   REQ 3: The mechanism MUST consider Media servers which supports
   simultaneouly multiple types of media, codec types for media.

   REQ 4: The mechanism MUST consider multiple types of resources which
   will be used for media handling.

   REQ 5: The mechanism MUST be efficient in all network topology like
   load balancing, multiple source, and mesh network as mentioned in
   [I-D.ietf-soc-overload-design].

   REQ 6: The mechanism MUST be based on external feedback to the
   upstream entity.


7.  Security Considerations

   Like all protocol mechanisms, a solution for overload handling must
   prevent against malicious side and outside attacks.  Security
   requirements are TBD.

   Any mechanism that improves the behavior of SIP elements under load
   will result in more predictable performance in the face of
   application-layer denial-of-service attacks.


8.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration for this draft.

 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Resource availability Event package
             draft-partha-dispatch-resource-availability-00

Abstract

   Collecting Resource availability information in Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) devices in real time helps in better managebility of
   resources in the SIP network.  Resource availability monitoring in
   SIP devices helps administrator to take informed decision and
   corrective measures to tackle under or over resource utilization in
   the network.  Resource availability information can also be used for
   SIP overload control in SIP based Media servers by passing resource
   demand vector between devices.  This document defines resource
   availability XML document and the mechanisms that can be used to
   exchange the document between SIP entities.

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package     August 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Voice/Video over IP (VoIP) network, Session Initiation protocol
   (SIP) [RFC3261] is widely deployed as a signaling protocol.  Resource
   availability information from SIP devices improves the managebility
   of SIP devices by providing a framework for multiple applications
   like Resource utilization monitoring, overload handling in SIP based
   media servers.

   Monitoring the resource utilization pattern at any given time helps
   VoIP administrator to decide whether the VoIP network resources need
   to be expanded or it is under utilized.  SIP based resource
   utilization is preferred within SIP network and removes the need for
   using any other management protocol for resource monitoring purpose.

   Overload requirements for SIP are explained in [RFC5390].  In case of
   using Resource availability information for overload protection
   mechanism, SIP server indicates its resource capability and resource
   demand vector to the prior SIP server by which prior SIP server will
   be able to perform intelligent routing.  The resouce demand vector
   provides the consumption of resources for the specific type of dialog
   (audio, video, telepresence, etc.,).  As SIP is used for overload
   protection, it is easy to relate the overload protection information
   to specific SIP entity within the SIP network without having any
   separate naming or addressing scheme.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs.


3.  Resource availability indication mechanism

   Resource availability indication mechanism by UA helps resource
   statistics collector to collect the data and act upon them
   accordingly.  The solution is targeted for SIP trunks or between SIP
   servers.  By the proposed mechanism, the individual devices indicate
   their current resource availability information through XML document
   defined in this draft.  Load Balancer or resource statistics
   collector acts as a subscriber and subscribe to the resource in the
   individual UA.  Individual devices acts as Notifier and inform the
   resource information in XML.

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package     August 2010


   In the resource monitor, the periodic resource information is
   collected from all the devices and the reports are formed.  These
   statistics provide effective resource utilization indication for any
   given resource at any point of time.  This information helps
   administrator to take informed decision and corrective measures to
   tackle under or over resource utilization in the network.

   In the load balancing scenario, the load balancer subscribes to all
   the relevant SIP servers and is informed about the current resource
   information.  Based on the resource availability indication, the call
   is routed to the appropriate SIP servers.  In case one of the devices
   is reached almost out of the resource, the device notifies the load
   balancer immediately.  This helps load balancer to decide where to
   route the dialog when multiple routes are available for the given
   dialog.  The algorithm of using resource availability to achieve load
   balancing and resource demand vector for the individual call type is
   kept out of scope of this document.  The threshold for the resource
   has to be decided by administrator by keep in mind that NOTIFY
   message has to be formed and send out to the external server and also
   resource priority dialog has to be processed without any
   interruption.

   OPTIONS response message MAY be used for exchange resource
   availability information.  (Using OPTIONS for this package is TBD).


4.  Resource availability Event package definition

   This document defines the details of the SIP event package for
   Resource availability based routing according to [RFC3265]

4.1.  Event Package name

   The name of the event package is resource-availability.  This event
   name has to be mentioned in the Event and allow-event header as
   mentioned in [RFC3265]

4.2.  Event Package Parameters

   There is no specific event package parameter specified for this event
   package.

4.3.  SUBSCRIBE bodies

   A SUBSCRIBE request for resource availability policy MAY contain a
   body to request the specific resources availability notification.
   For example, a subscriber is interested in some specific resources
   only.  The details of the subscription filter specification are not

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package     August 2010


   yet defined.

   A SUBSCRIBE request sent without a body implies the default
   subscription behavior as specified in the sec 4.7.

4.4.  SUBSCRIBE duration

   Subscription duration depends upon the deployment.  The default
   duration for this package is 300 sec.  It is not recommended to have
   the refresh timer less than 180 sec.  Refresh of subscription ensures
   that the next hop is up before new dialog request is forwarded.
   Refresh subscription should be triggered 32 sec before the expiry
   time of the package.  This keepalive mechanism is useful to decide
   whether Notifier trunk is reachable or not.  The user defined value
   shall be used depending on the deployment scenario.

   In case of SUBSCRIBE refresh failure, it is recommended that new
   SUBSCRIBE is initiated after the expiry of user mentioned timer.

4.5.  NOTIFY bodies

   The body of a NOTIFY message in this event package contains resource
   information of a device.  The format of the NOTIFY body MUST be in
   one of the formats defined in the Accept header field of the
   SUBSCRIBE request or be the default format as specified in [RFC3265].
   The default data format for the NOTIFY body of this event package is
   "application/rai+xml" (defined in Section 7).

   This means that if no Accept header field is specified to a SUBSCRIBE
   request, the NOTIFY will contain a body in the "application/rai+xml"
   format.  If the Accept header field is present in SUBSCRIBE request,
   it MUST include "application/rai+xml" and MAY include any other
   types.

4.6.  Notifier processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   Notifier has to provide the sensitive device resource information to
   the subscriber in the notification mechanism.  The entire subscriber
   has to be authenticated before providing the package details.  The
   existing authentication SIP mechanism like DIGEST, TLS, and S/MIME
   shall be used.  In the trusted domain, the authentication may not be
   required and the administrator has to decide the trusted domain and
   non-trusted domain.

   The requested SUBSCRIBER is not allowed to receive the requested
   information, 403 response MUST be sent by Notifier.

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package     August 2010


4.7.  Notifier generation of NOTIFY Requests

   NOTIFY has to be formatted as per [RFC3265], it has to contain
   resource availability information.  NOTIFY has to be sent immediately
   after SUBSCRIBE is received for initial dialog or refresh and
   responded with 200 OK.  Notifier MUST notify SUBSCRIBER whenever any
   of the resource reaching almost out of the resource state or going
   below the configured threshold.  Almost out of the resource value for
   the given resource or system will be decided by the administrator.
   The threshold notification helps SUBSCRIBER to decide whether the
   dialog shall be forwarded or not based on SUBSCRIBER policy.
   Notifier shall notify the resource information in the periodic
   manner.  When any of the resource is reaching almost out of the
   resource, NOTIFY will be send which contain only the resource which
   reached almost out of the resource.

4.8.  Subscriber processing of NOTIFY requests

   Subscriber updates the dialog routing logic based on the incoming
   NOTIFY message.  In case NOTIFY message contains almost out of the
   resource for the specific resource or the whole system, the dialog
   routing logic in the subscriber has to be updated with appropriate
   information by which any further dialog SHOULD NOT be routed to
   Notifier till getting further notification with resource available
   indication from Notifier.

   In case NOTIFY is received in the periodic manner, the resource based
   routing and statistics for the individual device usage at a given
   time is updated with the received NOTIFY message body information.

4.9.  Handling of forked requests

   Forking of SUBSCRIBE request is not supported for this package.  In
   case of forking happened, forked response has to be handled as
   mentioned in Sec 4.4.9 of [RFC3265].

4.10.  Rate of Notifications

   Rate of Notification SHOULD NOT be less than once every 32 sec as the
   notification itself will be observed as an overhead otherwise.  It is
   recommended that the rate of notification happens once every 120 sec.
   The administrator is the best person to decide the notification time
   based on the network topology.  The rate of notification MAY be
   reduced or stopped when almost out of the resource is attained for
   the critical resources like CPU, Memory and the critical resource
   list is based on device.

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package     August 2010


4.11.  State Agents

   The resource availability indications are generated by SIP entity
   directly and there is no need of explicit state agent for this
   package.  As load balancing based on the resource availability
   indication has to be done in the real time, the aggregation done by
   any state agent will introduce delay and hence defeat overload
   requirements.

4.12.  Behavior of SIP Proxy

   This subscription mechanism is recommended for neighboring SIP
   entities as it provides more control on overload mechanism.  In case
   the network topology requires to pass this resource information
   through proxy, Proxy has to forward SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages and
   this may be required when intermediate proxy is interworking and load
   balancing is decided by entity sitting behind the proxy.

4.13.  Refresh SUBSCRIBE mechanism for failure handling

   Apart from refresh subscription as explained in sec 4.4, Refresh
   subscription shall be triggered in the following network error
   scenarios as well:

   o  ICMP message received during dialog creation from the Notifying
      entity
   o  TCP connection failure from the Notifying entity
   o  Dialog creation timeout

   Refresh Subscription shall be started whenever 503 is received for
   any dialog creation request from Notifying entity.

   Till this refresh subscription succeeds, new dialog MUST NOT be
   forwarded to the Notifying entity.  In case of refresh SUBSCRIBE
   failure, new SUBSCRIBE has to be started as mentioned in sec 4.4 and
   no further dialog has to be forwarded till new SUBSCRIBE dialog is
   created.


5.  Resource availability Indication (RAI) document format

5.1.  Contents

   Resource availability indication (RAI) document is a XML document
   which will be embedded as message body in NOTIFY message of resource-
   availability package.  The document contains

   o  Entity parameter in Resource-availability to specify the entity
      whose resource information is available as part of this message
   o  Resource Tuple indicates the individual resources total and
      available capabilities, and also whether the resource is available
      for further new dialog processing (Optional)
   o  Resource Subtype provides the granular information within the
      particular resource.  (Optional)

5.2.  XML data format

   RAI object is a XML document.  It MUST have the XML declaration and
   it SHOULD contain an encoding declaration in the XML declaration,
   e.g., "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>".  If the charset
   parameter of the MIME content type declaration is present and it is
   different from the encoding declaration, the charset parameter takes
   precedence.

   Every application conformant to this specification MUST accept the
   UTF-8 character encoding to ensure the minimal interoperability.

5.2.1.  Namespace

   The namespace URI for elements defined by this specification is a
   Uniform Resource Namespace (URN) [RFC2141], using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf' defined by [RFC2648] and extended by [RFC3688].

   The URN is as follows: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rai

5.2.2.  Resource-Availability

   Resource-Availability element MUST contain an xmlns namespace
   attribute with value as urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rai.

   Resource-availability MUST have entity attribute which contains SIP/
   SIPS URI to identify the device which provides the resource
   information.  The entity attribute SIP/SIPS URI FQDN or IP address
   represents the device and may not have user part.

5.3.  Resource

   This element indicates the individual resource status at the given
   time.  This is an optional element wherein the resources type like
   CPU, Memory, DSP, DS0, available bandwidth, disk storage are
   mentioned in type attribute.  Each resource element shall have almost
   out of resource status, total and available resource usage.  This
   resource information helps in routing or load balancing or resource
   monitoring based on the individual resource availability.  Available
   bandwidth mentioned in this element is the indicator of how many bits

   of data the system can process per second session(audio/video).

5.4.  Resource-subtype

   This element comes within a particular resource element to provide an
   internal division within a given resource.  For example, Memory shall
   be divided into processor memory, IO memory and provides the
   individual status.  This division helps in load balancing in case
   routing entity aware of the resource capability required for the
   specified call.  This is an optional element.

5.4.1.  Almost-out-of-resource

   Almost-out-of-resource is a Boolean element to indicate whether
   system or resource is reached the threshold or not.  This threshold
   is decided by Notifier or subscriber shall send it through other
   mechanism.

   Almost-out-of-resource value true indicates that the threshold is
   reached.  To avoid the back-forth movement in the threshold range, it
   is preferred to provide the upper watermark value which decides the
   above threshold limit and lower watermark value is used when the
   above threshold is back to normal.  True value is set for almost out
   of resource when upper watermark is reached and when lower watermark
   is reached, almost out of resource is set with false.

                    Above Threshold
                    <--------->  Upper Watermark
                       |   |
                    <--------->  Lower Watermark
                    Below Threshold


                Watermark mechanism for Threshold handling

5.5.  Total & Available

   Total and Available elements provide absolute value or the value
   specified as per unit element.  These are optional element.

5.6.  Unit

   Unit is a string which indicates unit for the given resource or
   resource subtype.  The default value of unit is absolute value.

5.7.  Timestamp

   Timestamp element contains a string indicating the date and time of
   the status change of this tuple.  The value of this element MUST
   follow the IMPP datetime format [RFC3339].  Timestamps that contain
   'T' or 'Z' MUST use the capitalized forms.

   As a security measure, the timestamp element SHOULD be included in
   all tuples unless the exact time of the status change cannot be
   determined.

5.8.  Example

   The example provides all the tuples involved in rai xml body.

6.  Use Case for Resource Availability mechanism

6.1.  Subscriber acts as resource monitor only

   This is the simple scenario wherein subscriber simply collects the
   Notifier statistics and store or display.  This is useful when
   Administrator is interested in the usage of the VoIP network
   resource.  Total and available element will be used by subscriber.
   In this scenario, subscriber will not honor the almost out of
   resource information from the notifier.

6.2.  Subscriber pools for resource status

   In this mode, Subscriber is interested in the resource status at a
   given time, and one shot subscription shall be used for this
   mechanism.

6.3.  Subscriber acts as overload protection

   In this deployment, subscriber stop/start the load based on the
   almost out of resource parameter of the body.  System&aposs almost
   out of resource is set to true whenever any one of the resource is
   reached almost out of the resource.  In case the subscriber is aware
   that the new dialog does not require the set of resource which
   reached almost out resource, the new dialog shall be forwarded.  For
   example, DS0 is almost out of the resource and the new dialog does
   not require DS0 resource, the new dialog shall be forwarded to
   Notifier.  The resource requirement of Notifier for the specific
   dialog shall be intimated to Subscriber through other protocol
   mechanism or provisioning mechanism which is outside the scope of
   this document.


7.  XML Schema definition for Resource availability

   This section defines XML schema for resource availability document.

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <xs:schema targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rai"
   xmlns:tns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rai"

8.  Security Considerations

   Security consideration for event based framework as specified in
   [RFC3265] has to be considered for this draft as well.  As the
   resource information is sensitive information, Subscribe/Notify shall
   use TLS transport in case subscriber and Notifier are in the public
   domain.  In case subscriber is a untrusted entity, subscriber will be
   authenticated by responding with 401.  The administrator provides
   authorization mechanism by which different entity will be provided
   with different level of information.  For example, all SIP entity
   within enterprise could be provided complete resource information and
   only system level information could be provided towards service
   provider network.

   The resource information provided in this mechanism is more critical.
   If the above specified mechanism is not secure enough, there is a
   scope for coming up with addition security measures (TBD).


9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a SIP event package, a new MIME type, a
   new XML namespace, and a new XML schema.

9.1.  Resource availability package Registration

   This section registers an event package based on the registration
   procedures defined in [RFC3265].
      Package name: resource-availability
      Type: package

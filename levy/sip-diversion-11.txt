                      Diversion Indication in SIP

Abstract

   This RFC, which contains the text of an Internet Draft that was
   submitted originally to the SIP Working Group, is being published now
   for the historical record and to provide a reference for later
   Informational RFCs.  The original Abstract follows.

   This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP).  This extension provides the ability for the called
   SIP user agent to identify from whom the call was diverted and why
   the call was diverted.
   The extension defines a general header, Diversion, which conveys the
   diversion information from other SIP user agents and proxies to the
   called user agent.
   This extension allows enhanced support for various features,
   including Unified Messaging, Third-Party Voicemail, and Automatic
   Call Distribution (ACD).  SIP user agents and SIP proxies which
   receive diversion information may use this as supplemental
   information for feature invocation decisions.

Internet-Draft              Diversion header               February 2010


1.  Introduction

   This RFC, which contains the text of an Internet Draft that was
   submitted originally to the SIP Working Group, is being published now
   for the historical record and to provide a reference for later
   Informational RFCs.

   In the legacy telephony network, redirection information is passed
   through the network in ISDN/ISUP signaling messages.  This
   information is used by various service providers and business
   applications to support enhanced features for the end user.
   An analogous mechanism of providing redirection information would
   enable such enhanced features for SIP users.
   The Diversion header allows implementation of feature logic based on
   from whom the call was diverted.
   Version 06 (and forward) of the draft adds support for privacy and
   screening information.


2.  Definitions

   diversion:
   A change to the ultimate destination endpoint of a request.  A change
   in the Request-URI of a request that was not caused by a routing
   decision.  This is also sometimes called a deflection or redirection.
   A diversion can occur when the "user" portion of the Request-URI is
   changed for a reason other than expansion or translation.
   A diversion can occur when only the "host" portion of the Request-URI
   has changed if the change was due to a non-routing decision.

   divertor:
   The entity which diverted the call.

   recursing:
   A SIP proxy or user agent which handles a received or internally
   generated 3xx response by forking new request(s) itself.

   non-recursing:
   A SIP proxy or user agent which handles a received or internally
   generated 3xx response by forwarding it upstream.

   CFUNV: Call Forward Unavailable
   ACD: Automatic Call Distribution


4.  Overview

   In order to implement certain third-party features such as third-
   party voicemail and Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) applications,
   diversion information needs to be given to the called third-party so
   that he may respond to the caller intelligently.
   In these situations, the party receiving a diverted call needs
   answers for two questions:
   Question 1: From whom was the request diverted?
   Question 2: Why was the request diverted?

   This document proposes usage of the Diversion header to answer these
   questions for the party receiving the diverted call.
   Insertion of the previous Request-URI (before the diversion occurred)
   into the Diversion header answers question 1.
   Insertion of the "reason" tag into the Diversion header (by the
   divertor) answers question 2.

4.1.  When is the Diversion header used?

   The Diversion header SHOULD be added when a SIP proxy server, SIP
   redirect server, or SIP user agent changes the ultimate endpoint
   which will receive the call.
   Diversion information SHOULD NOT be added for normal call routing
   changes to the Request-URI.  Thus, the Diversion header is not added
   when features such as speed dial change the Request-URI.
   When a diversion occurs, a Diversion header SHOULD be added to the
   forwarded request or forwarded 3xx response.  The Diversion header
   MUST contain the Request-URI of the request prior to the diversion.
   The Diversion header SHOULD contain a reason that the diversion
   occurred.
   Existing Diversion headers received in an incoming request MUST NOT
   be removed or changed in forwarded requests.
   Existing Diversion headers received in an incoming response MUST NOT
   be removed or changed in the forwarded response.
   A Diversion header is added when features such as call forwarding or
   call deflection change the Request-URI.


5.  Extension syntax

   The syntax of the Diversion header is:

   The following is an extension of tables 4 and 5 in [RFC3261]for the
   Diversion header:

          Diversion             3xx          h   -   -   -   o   -   -


6.  Detailed semantics

6.1.  UAS Behavior

   A SIP UAS which receives a request and returns a 3xx SHOULD add a
   Diversion header containing the previous Request-URI and the reason
   for the diversion.

6.2.  UAC Behavior

   A SIP UAC which receives a 3xx containing a Diversion header SHOULD
   copy the Diversion header into each downstream forked request which
   resulted from the 3xx.

6.3.  Redirect Server Behavior

   A SIP redirect server which receives a request and returns a 3xx
   containing a Contact which diverts the request to a different
   endpoint SHOULD add a Diversion header containing the Request-URI
   from the incoming request and the reason for the diversion.

6.4.  Proxy Server Behavior

   A non-recursing SIP proxy which receives a 3xx containing a Diversion
   header SHOULD forward the 3xx containing the Diversion header
   upstream unchanged.
   A SIP proxy which receives a request and invokes a feature which
   changes the Request-URI of the forwarded request in order to divert
   the request to a different endpoint SHOULD add a Diversion header
   containing the Request-URI from the incoming request and the reason
   for the diversion.
   A SIP proxy which receives a request and returns a 3xx containing a
   Contact which diverts the request to a different endpoint SHOULD add
   a Diversion header containing the Request-URI from the incoming
   request and the reason for the diversion.

       if (pdu.is_request()) {
           if (request-URI is changed due to a called feature) {
               if (proxy.is_recursing()) {
                   Add the Diversion header (indicating the reason
                     that the call has been diverted) to
                     the downstream forwarded request(s).
               } else {
                   Add the Diversion header (indicating the reason
                     that the call has been diverted) to
                     the upstream forwarded 3xx response.
               }
           }
       } else if (pdu.is_response()) {
           if (pdu.is_3xx()) {
               if (proxy.is_recursing()) {
                 Copy Diversion header into forwarded INVITE(s).
               } else {
                 Forward response upstream.
               }
           }
       }


7.  Examples using Diversion header

   There are several implementations of call forwarding features that
   can be implemented by either recursing or non-recursing SIP proxies
   or SIP user agents.
   A SIP proxy or user agent which generates or forwards 3xx's upstream
   is non-recursing.  A SIP proxy or user agent which handles received
   (or internally generated) 3xx's itself is recursing.
   The following examples illustrate usage of the Diversion header for

7.1.  Call Forward Unconditional

   Usage of the Diversion header is shown below for several variant
   implementations of Call Forward Unconditional.

7.1.1.  Network Call Forward Unconditional, P2 recursing

   In this message flow, the call would normally be routed to Bob@B.
   However, Proxy 2 (P2) recursively implements Call Forward
   Unconditional (CFUNC) to Carol@C.

Internet-Draft              Diversion header               February 2010


8.  Security Considerations

   There are some privacy considerations when using the Diversion
   header.
   Usage of the Diversion header implies that the diverting UAS trusts
   the diverted-to UAS.
   Usage of the Diversion header by SIP proxies or SIP user agents can
   cause information leakage of route information and called information
   to untrusted SIP proxies and untrusted callers in upstream 3xx's.
   Leakage of this information can be mitigated by having a recursing
   trusted upstream proxy server.
   For a SIP network architecture where all proxies are required to be
   non-recursive, Diversion header hiding may be considered necessary in
   order to prevent leakage of route information to the caller.  To
   accomplish Diversion header hiding, a trusted upstream proxy would
   add a Record-Route header and use a secret key to encrypt the
   contents of the Diversion header in 3xx's which are forwarded
   upstream.  On receipt of re-INVITEs the proxy would decrypt the
   contents of the Diversion header (using its secret key) and forward
   the INVITE.
   There is no currently defined interaction of the Diversion and Hide
   headers.
   Question: Should there be?


9.  Further Examples

   Only the relevant headers have been included in the following
   examples.  The contents of the SDPs has also been omitted.

9.1.  Night Service/Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) using Diversion
      header

   In the following 2 message flows two separate companies,
   WeSellPizza.com and WeSellFlowers.com, have contracted with a third
   company, NightService.com to provide nighttime support for their
   incoming voice calls.
   In the first flow, Alice calls out for pizza.  In the second flow,
   Alice calls for roses.  In both instances, the same night service
   company (and receptionist, Carol) answers the call.  However, because
   the Diversion header is used, Carol is able to customize her greeting
   to the caller.

9.2.  Voicemail Service using Diversion header

   Bob has contracted his Voicemail to a third-party company,
   Voicemail.com.  In this message flow, Bob has hit the Do-Not-Disturb
   button on his phone.  The Do-Not-Disturb functionality of Bob's phone
   is configured to CFUNC (Call Forward Unconditional) to
   voicemail@isp.com.  Because the Diversion header is used,
   Voicemail.com is able to place the incoming call into Bob's voice
   mailbox.

     mailbox.

9.3.  Q&A on alternative approaches

   Question 1:
   Why do we need the Diversion header when we can see the To: header?

   Answer:
   a) The To: header is not guaranteed to have significance to the
   called party.
   For example, the To: header may contain a locally significant URL (to
   the caller) such as a private numbering plan, speed dial digits,
   telephony escape digits, or telephony prefix digits.
   Without a Diversion header, enumerating all possible locally
   significant To: headers that anyone might use to contact
   Bob@uas1.isp.com becomes a configuration problem at Voicemail@isp.com
   and is prone to namespace collision.
   Support for Diversion headers enables Bob to contract a third-party
   service (Voicemail@isp.com) with a single globally significant URL
   for his voice mailbox (Bob@uas1.isp.com).
   b) Given a set of multiple diversions, there is a policy decision of
   which Diversion header takes precedence for service logic.  Different
   services (or even different users for the same service) may want to
   configure this policy differently (first, last,second to last, etc).


   Question 2:
   Why do we need the Diversion header when we can see the Via: header?

   Answer:
   The Via header does not contain information about servers whom have
   deflected the call (using a 3xx).


10.  Mapping ISUP/ISDN Redirection information to SIP Diversion header

   The discussions below regarding ISUP/ISDN reflect generic elements in
   ISUP/ISDN.  In some variations of ISUP/ISDN, the information elements
   are represented differently.  Regardless of the ISUP/ISDN variant,
   translation should be performed for the "first redirecting number"
   and the "last redirecting number".
   In order to prevent ambiguity, it is important to highlight a
   terminology mismatch between ISUP/ISDN and SIP.  In SIP, a "redirect"
   indicates the act of returning a 3xx response.  In ISUP/ISDN a
   "redirection" is diversion of a call by a network entity.  In ISUP/
   ISDN a call may also be deflected (by an endpoint).  Diversion is the
   more generic term which refers to either the act of an network
   redirection or endpoint deflection.

Internet-Draft              Diversion header               February 2010


   In SIP, Diversion can be implemented as either an upstream 3xx (non-
   recursive) or an additionally forked downstream request (recursive).
   In the following text, a lower-case "redirect" indicates the SIP
   usage, while an uppercase "Redirect" indicates ISUP usage.

10.1.  Mapping ISUP/ISDN Diversion Reason codes
ISUP and ISDN define the following diversion reasons:

     0000 = Unknown
     0001 = Call forwarding busy or called DTE busy
     0010 = Call forwarding no reply
     1111 = Call forwarding unconditional or systematic call redirection
     1010 = Call deflection or call forwarding by the called DTE
     1001 = Call forwarding DTE out of order

     Mapping of ISUP/ISDN reason codes to Diversion reason codes is
     performed as follows:

     ISUP/ISDN reason code       Diversion reason code
     0001                        "user-busy"
     0010                        "no-answer"
     1111                        "unconditional"
     1010                        "deflection"
     1001                        "unavailable"
     0000                        all others

   elements may be translated across an ISUP/SIP gateway.

10.2.1.  ISUP Definitions
      Called party number          The number of the party to which the
                                    call is currently being routed.


       Redirecting number           The number to which the call was
                                    being routed when the last diversion
                                    occurred.

       Redirecting reason           The reason that the last diversion
                                    occurred.


       Original called number       The number to which the call was

                                    diversion occurred.

       Original redirecting reason  The reason that the first diversion
                                    occurred.

       Redirection counter          The count of the total number of
                                    diversions that have occurred.

       Address Presentation         Indication of whether presentation
                                    is allowed or restricted.

10.2.2.  ISUP parameters

   When a SIP call transits a SIP/ISUP gateway, the following
   information in the ISUP message should be examined/set when
   translating SIP Diversion headers to ISUP diversion information:
            1) Redirecting Number
            2) Redirecting reason
            3) Redirecting address presentation
            4) Original called number
            5) Original redirecting reason
            6) Original address presentation
            7) Redirection counter.

   An ISUP message contains information on the first and last diversions
   that occurred.  The Redirection Number is to which the call was being
   routed when the last diversion occurred.  The Redirecting Reason is
   the reason that the last diversion occurred.
   The Original Called Number is the number to which the call was being
   routed when the first diversion occurred.  The Original Redirecting
   Reason is the reason that the first diversion occurred.
   When only one Diversion has occurred, the number to which the call
   was being routed when the diversion occurred is in the Redirecting

   Number and the reason for that diversion is carried in the Redirect
   Reason.

10.2.3.  ISUP to SIP translation

   The ISUP Redirecting Number SHOULD be used to set the value of the
   name-addr of the top-most Diversion header.  The ISUP Redirecting
   Number address presentation SHOULD be used to set the value of the
   diversion-privacy of the top-most Diversion header.  The ISUP
   Redirecting Reason SHOULD be used to set the value of the diversion-
   reason of the top-most Diversion header.  When present, the Original
   Called Number SHOULD be used to set the name-addr of the bottom-most
   Diversion header.  When present, the Original Redirecting Reason
   SHOULD be used to set the diversion-reason of the bottom-most
   Diversion header.When present, the Original address presentation
   SHOULD be used to set the diversion-privacy of the bottom-most
   Diversion header.
   The Redirect Counter value minus 1 SHOULD be stored in the diversion-
   counter associated with the top-most Diversion header.  Presence of
   the diversion-counter for the bottom-most Diversion header is
   optional.  If present the diversion-counter of the bottom-most
   Diversion header SHOULD be 1.

10.2.4.  SIP to ISUP translation

   The name-addr of the top-most Diversion header SHOULD be used to set
   the ISUP Redirecting Number.  The diversion-reason of the top-most
   Diversion header SHOULD be used to set the ISUP Redirecting
   Reason.The diversion-privacy of the top-most Diversion header SHOULD
   be used to set the ISUP Redirecting Address Presentation.  When
   multiple Diversion headers are present, the name-addr of the bottom-
   most Diversion header SHOULD be used to set the ISUP Original
   Redirecting Number.
   When multiple Diversion headers are present, the diversion-reason of
   the bottom-most Diversion header SHOULD be used to set the ISUP
   Original Redirecting Reason.  When multiple Diversion headers are
   present, the diversion-privacy of the bottom-most Diversion header
   SHOULD be used to set the ISUP Original Redirecting Address
   Presentation.
   The ISUP Redirection counter SHOULD be set equal to the sum of the
   counters of all Diversion headers in the SIP message.  A Diversion
   header which does not explicitly specify a diversion-counter tag
   counts as 1.

10.3.  Mapping ISDN Redirection information to SIP Diversion header

   An ISDN message can contain up to two instances of a Redirecting
   number information element.  When a diversion occurs, an additional
   Redirection number information element is added.  When a third (or
   greater) diversion occurs, the new Redirecting number information
   element replaces the bottom-most Redirection number information
   element.

10.3.1.  ISDN Definitions
       Called party number          The number of the party to which the

                                    occurred.

       Reason for diversion         The reason that the last diversion
                                    occurred.

       Origin of Number             Indicates whether number is user

          6) Origin of Number and Presentation Status of the bottom-most
             Redirection number information element
   An ISDN message contains information on the first and last diversions
   that occurred.  The top-most Redirection number information element
   contains information (including the Redirecting number, Origin of
   Number, Presentation Status, and Reason for diversion) about the last
   diversion that occurred.  The bottom-most Redirection number
   information element contains information (including the Redirecting
   number, Origin of Number, Presentation Status,and Reason for
   diversion) about the first diversion that occurred.
   If only one Diversion has occurred, only one Redirection number
   information element is present.
   The Redirecting Number information element has the same Type of
   Number/Numbering Plan, and Digits as the Calling Party Number
   information element.
   There is no Redirection counter associated with this ISDN information
   element.
   Notice that the order of the Redirection number information elements
   in an ISDN message (top=first, bottom=last) is reversed from the
   order of Diversion headers in a SIP message (top=last, bottom=first).

10.3.3.  ISDN to SIP translation

   The Redirecting number of the top-most ISDN Redirecting number

   The Origin of Number of the top-most ISDN Redirecting number
   information element SHOULD be used to set the value of the diversion-
   screen of the bottom-most Diversion header.  The Presentation Status
   of the top-most ISDN Redirecting number information element SHOULD be

10.4.  Information loss in SIP to ISUP/ISDN translation

   Because ISUP and ISDN only support a subset of the information in a
   SIP Diversion header, information loss occurs during translation at a
   SIP/ISUP or SIP/ISDN boundary.

10.4.1.  Loss of diversion URI information

   Because ISUP and ISDN only support a subset of URI types,
   (specifically tel: URIs and sip:x@y;user=phone URIs) Diversion
   information occurring for other URI types may be lost when crossing
   from SIP to ISDN or ISUP.

10.4.2.  Loss of diversion reason information

   Because ISUP and ISDN only support a subset of the reason codes
   supported by the Diversion header, specific reason code information
   may be lost when crossing from SIP to ISDN or ISUP.

10.4.3.  Loss of diversion counter information

   Because ISDN does not support a counter field (indicating the number
   of diversions that have occurred), counter information may be lost
   when crossing from SIP to ISDN.

<abstract><t>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important
for network diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public policy.  To
conduct such measurements, user networks gather data, either on their own
initiative or instructed by a measurement controller, and then upload the
measurement results to a designated measurement server.  This document
describes a logical architecture and summarizes key requirements for protocols
to connect the components.  The system is designed to support residential and
small-enterprise networks, using either wired or wireless networks.  The
architecture supports an extensible set of active and passive measurements, but
the details of the metrics themselves are beyond the scope of this
document.</t></abstract>
</front>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>Measuring actual network performance is crucial to managing consumer and
enterprise networks, but, when performed at scale, it also allows third parties
to gain insight into the actual performance of such networks, facilitating
consumer choice and allowing to evaluate the state of broadband performance in a
country, among other public policy goals. A number of network performance
metrics have been defined, such as <xref target="RFC2681"/>, but there is no
overall architecture and set of protocols that facilitates gathering such
measurements in a coordinated way, at scales drawing on thousands or millions of
nodes.</t>

<t>Large-scale measurement efforts (e.g., <xref target="MBA"/>) use
proprietary, custom-designed mechanisms to coordinate the measurement
clients.  They require that the organization running the measurements deploy thousands of dedicated hardware components or rely on
end-system software modules that are subject to exogeneous factors, such
as home networks, that may distort the results.  Thus, this document
proposes an overall architecture, with emphasis on the functional and
security requirements for the protocols connecting the elements of the
architecture, that will make it possible to build measurement
capabilities into home and enterprise edge routers, personal computers,
mobile devices and other edge devices.</t>

<t>Any usage and implementation will likely impose a number of
additional operational requirements and a statistical sampling
methodology.  For example, the Measurement Broadband America project
<xref target="MBA"/> within the US Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) has established specific operational guidelines on data validity
and commits to specific requirements for open access to measurement
data, software tools and documentation of measurement methodology and
statistical approaches.  While crucial for deployment, these are beyond
the scope of this protocol requirements document.  Also, as is customary
for IETF-managed protocols, this document does not mandate a specific
hardware or operating system platform for implementation.</t>

<t>We suggest that the IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
working group take on defining any additional performance metrics as
needed.  Such an effort should be undertaken as a collaborative effort with the Broadband Forum (BBF)
<xref target="BBF"/>; other SDOs may also take on aspects of this problem
area.</t>

<t>In some applications, such as data gathering by local regulatory entities,
extensive logging at various levels, from packet arrival times to events, will
be used to assure all parties of the validity of the data gathered. However,
logging is beyond the scope of this document.</t> 

<t>Both active and passive measurement techniques have been widely accepted in
practice.  In active measurements, the end systems emits traffic and observes a
performance metric, or has another end point do so.  Examples of active
measurements include round-trip delay <xref target="RFC2681"/>, one-way delay
<xref target="RFC2679"/> and throughput <xref target="RFC3148"/> metrics,
service availability, as well as a range of measurements that try to emulate
application behavior, such as VoIP, HTTP retrievals or media streaming.
Passive measurements observe existing user traffic flows.  We note that there
is some overlap between NetFlow <xref target="RFC3954"/> measurements and
passive measurements described here.  The delineation between the two and
possible re-use of functionality are left to further discussion.</t>

<t>For both active and passive measurements, a measurement client sends
or observes traffic, respectively.  For active measurements, the
measurement client may need a measurement server as serve as recipient
of the measurement traffic.  (In some cases, such as measurements
modeling user access to network services, such as web page retrieval
performance, the measurement traffic is exchanged with a production
server, such as a web server, but this requires careful design to avoid
overloading that server with measurement traffic.) Since we are
interested in large-scale measurements, we assume that a measurement
controller provides the measurement client with information on what to
measure and when to perform the measurements.  Finally, in some cases, a
measurement data collector gathers data, typically samples rather than
aggregate data, collected by the measurement clients for later
analysis.  The data models and file formats for supporting the exchange of the test parameters as well as test results require standardization.</t>

<t>As noted above, it appears likely that metrics will evolve and new ones will be added over time.  Components of the platform may be designed and
operated by different, independent entities, or, at minimum, data
gathered by the platform may be used by different parties for different
purposes.  For example, a regulator or ISP might contract with third parties to manage various components of a measurement effort, and all data communications must securely support the delegation and authentication of rights and responsibilities to perform any operational parameter supported by the measurement architecture.  Thus, it will be important to agree to on a set of metrics
and associated metric-specific protocol parameters.  For example, the
TCP throughput metric defined in <xref target="RFC3148"/> depends on the
TCP congestion avoidance algorithm.  Each measurement run generates one
or more data samples, e.g., a set of throughput values.  The controller
needs to convey those parameters to the measurement client and the data
collector needs to be able to determine unambiguously which parameters
were used for a specific set of data samples.</t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.  Although RFC
2119 was written with protocols in mind, the key words are used in this
document to indicate the strength of a requirement.</t>

</section>

<section title="Use Cases">

<t>Large-scale, automated measurements are helpful in a number of use cases.
We illustrate the scope with three examples:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Provider network measurements:"> Internet service providers
have an interest in knowing how well their networks are performing, as
viewed from their customers' perspective.  Such performance information
allows them to identify bottlenecks and observe the impact of changes in
user behavior, e.g., the emergence of new network applications or
time-of-day patterns.  Here, the provider is not interested in the
performance of an individual edge network or device, but rather wants to
get a statistically-valid sample of performance across their network. 
Service providers may be interested in both the end device performance,
i.e., the performance as seen by edge devices in home and enterprise
networks, as well as the edge performance, i.e., as seen by the network
device directly attached to their network, such as a cable modem, DSL
modem or enterprise edge router.  To reduce the network load, providers
are unlikely to gather measurements from all clients all the time, but
rather sample randomly across both time and their user population.  The
measurement controller directs the measurement client what measurements
are to be performed, what measurement servers to use, when to measure
and at which data collector it should deposit the measurement data.</t>

<t hangText="User network diagnostics:"> End users may want to determine
whether their network is performing according to the specifications
(e.g., service level agreements) offered by the Internet service
provider, or they may want to diagnose whether components of their
network path are impaired.  End users may perform measurements on their
own, using the measurement infrastructure they provide or infrastructure
offered by a third party, or they may work directly with their network
or application provider to diagnose a specific performance problem. 
Depending on the circumstances, measurements may occur at specific
pre-defined intervals, or may be triggered manually.  A system
administrator may perform such measurements on behalf of the user.</t>

<t hangText="Multi-provider network measurements:"> As an extension of
the first use case, multiple network providers and third parties, such
as a regulatory body, may collaborate to gather network performance data
on a one-time or recurring basis, using a subset of customers of the
service providers.  The form of collaboration is beyond the scope of
this paper, however it should be understood that a data collection
platform must serve multiple stakeholder interests.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In the description above, the network provider can either be a
commercial or not-for-profit entity distinct from the network edge
users, or it can be the information technology department in a local
area network.  Particularly for the user diagnostics use case, it may
be helpful for the measurement client to obtain parameters of their
connectivity, such as the nominal uplink and downlink speed.  In other
cases, only the entity performing the data analysis may need to know
the nominal performance parameters.</t>

</section>

<section title="Architecture Overview">

<t>We define a measurement platform to consist of one or more measurement
clients, measurement controllers and data collection servers.  Based on the use
cases above, we summarize their functions below.</t>

<section title="Measurement client">

<t>The measurement client is the reference point for measurements. For active
measurements, it sends measurement traffic to the measurement server or other
network elements. For passive measurements, it observes network performance
metrics.  Client measurement functionality must be implementable in a variety of user contexts and provide for communications within different network segments, such as the access link between a broadband subscribers modem and an ISP network, as well as consumer electronic device communicating to measurement server features in a wireless LAN device.</t>

</section>

<section title="Measurement server">

<t>The measurement server is only needed for active measurements that require
two network nodes.  The measurement server typically operates as a traffic
source or sink.  To allow scaling, different clients within a measurement
platform may use different measurement servers.  Clients may also select, for
example, the closest measurement server if the influence of wide-area
connectivity on measurement results is to be minimized.</t>

</section>

<section title="Measurement controller">

<t>The measurement controller provides the measurement client with
instructions on when and how to conduct what measurements, i.e., the
measurement schedule.  For example, it might instruct the client to
conduct a particular kind of throughput measurement every ten minutes,
and to deposit the throughput samples into a particular data collector. 
Measurement controllers may be capable of accepting inputs from other
controllers, scaling up the scope of the measurement system.  As one
example, an ISP operating a testing platform for its own network may
accept test requests from an external controller as part of a nationwide
testing program that it is participating in.</t>

</section>

<section title="Data collector">

<t>The data collector collects time-stamped measurement samples from
measurement clients.  It generally makes these measurement samples available
only to authorized users.  The data collector may store measurement samples in
a database or as files and may make them available via download or SQL query.
Access control, internal data storage and access methods to data are beyond the
scope of this document.</t>

<t>We logically separate the data collector from the measurement server for
both functional and performance reasons.  In general, data collected should not
be transferred to the collector while a measurement is in progress.  Also, a
measurement client on a mobile host may decide to delay transferring
measurement data until a low-cost or high-speed connection to the server
becomes available.</t>

</section>

<section title="Network parameter server">

<t>In some of the use cases, it is necessary for the analysis to compare the
measured against the nominal network performance, or correlate measured
parameters with the type and key parameters of the user’s network connection.
For example, for evaluating network delay measurements, it is helpful to know
what kind of access technology (e.g., FTTP, DSL, cable, cellular data or
satellite) and nominal speed the network connection offers.</t>

</section>
</section>

<section title="Protocols">

<t>With the description of the elements above and the relationships between
them, a set of protocols needs to be defined.  The key functions of the
protocols are described briefly below.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Measurement client to measurement server:"> Each metric will have
its own set of measurement protocols, and these are beyond the scope of this
document.  For example, a VoIP metric may use a defined set of UDP packets to
estimate performance.</t>

<t hangText="Measurement client to measurement controller:">  The measurement
client queries the measurement controller to obtain an updated measurement
schedule.  The measurement schedule returned by the controller indicates the
type of measurements the measurement client should perform, the measurement
servers and on what schedule to conduct the measurements.  For example, it
might indicate to run a VoIP emulation test every day for ten minutes to a
specific server, spanning a one-week measurement campaign.  The collector also
indicates one or more addresses of data collectors to the client.</t>

<t hangText="Measurement controller to measurement controller:"> A
measurement controller can request that another controller undertake a
specific testing program and could indicate specific tests, schedules
and sample parameters appropriate to the intended objectives.  Other
data could include the identity and identity verification of the
requester, a specific test identifier, e.g. Nationwide Test XX, and
information necessary for the data collector so that data is accessible
to authorized parties.</t>

<t hangText="Measurement client to data collector:"> The measurement client
will typically perform one or more measurements, and then, during the pause
between measurements, transmit the collected samples to the data collector.
The samples must be tagged with identifying information, such as when they were
collected, edge device information (e.g., the mobile device or cable modem) and
which measurement host was used.  For mobile measurements, the sample data is
likely to contain location data, possibly of reduced spatial resolution to
protect user privacy.</t>

<t hangText="Measurement client to network parameter server:">  The measurement
client may query the network parameter server, typically located in the
service providers network, for information about its nominal service
parameters, based on its network address, link layer address, or
hardware identifiers such as the IMEI for mobile nodes.  The data
returned may include information such as nominal uplink and downlink
speeds, data quotas and physical and data link layer technology.  (Data
quotas may be important for deciding which data-intensive measurements a
client wishes to run.)</t>

<t>While basic network connection information is unlikely to change rapidly, it
may change at unpredictable instants.  For example, a network provider may
upgrade the connection speed of subsets of their customers, customers may
change their subscription or provider may adjust the monthly data transfer
quota.</t>

<t>We assume that the measurement server, controller and data collector
cooperate in configuring appropriate parameters.  For example, the controller
needs to be able to determine which measurement servers and data collectors are
currently available and the client is authorized to use.  Discovery of suitable
data collectors is considered beyond the scope of this effort.</t>

</list></t>
</section>

<section title="Initiation of Measurements">

<t>Either the client or the measurement controller could in principle initiate
measurements.  For periodic measurements or one-off user-triggered diagnostics,
it is sufficient for the end system to contact the controller, e.g.,
periodically every week.  Client-initiated measurements have a number of
advantages.  In particular, they make it less likely that measurement hosts can
be abused to generate denial-of-service traffic.  They also avoid problems
allowing inbound requests through network address translators (NATs) and
firewalls.</t>

<t>However, there may be cases where the network provider wishes to initiate a
one-time measurement or change the measurement parameters before the client
next contacts the controller.  For such cases, a publish-subscribe mechanism
may be considered, where the measurement client subscribes to measurement
schedule updates with the measurement controller.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirements">

<t>We distinguish requirements for the different component by a prefix:
Requirements labeled A-* describe the overall platform architecture, M-*
indicate requirements primarily affecting the measurement client, C-* those for
the controller, D-* for the data collector and N-* for the functions necessary
to obtain network parameter.  In many cases, a single requirement governs more
than one entity or protocol, so the labeling should be considered rough.</t>

</list></t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>The large-scale measurement architecture has to prevent third
parties' use of the measurement clients in bot-nets or for other
nefarious or malicious purposes.  A malicious third party could cause a measurement
client to initiate probe traffic to victim hosts rather than measurement
servers.  We rely on user-initiated requests, secured with
transport-layer security and server certificates, to ensure that only
user-authorized entities issue control commands. Users may also authenticate
themselves via local shared secrets.  We note that there are similarities in approach with M2M data communications and we suggest that reference of ongoing work on the M2M signaling gateway framework or other models may be useful.</t>

<t>Measurements may also inadvertently expose information that the owner of the
measurement client considers privacy-sensitive.  Privacy considerations may
differ depending on whether the measurement client, measurement server or data
collector are operated by the same entity or not, and what trust relationships
these entities have with each other.  It must be possible to protect the
confidentiality of the measurement data exchanged between the measurement
client and the data collector.  For mobile measurements, location information
is likely to be crucial to interpreting measurement results.  A measurement
client may want to substitute rough location <xref target="rough-loc"/> to
reduce the ability of a third party to track its movements and whereabouts.</t>

                 WebSocket Per-frame DEFLATE Extension
           draft-tyoshino-hybi-websocket-perframe-deflate-01

Abstract

   This specification defines a per-frame DEFLATE compression extension
   for the WebSocket protocol.  This extension enables compressing only
   the Application Data part of WebSocket frames using DEFLATE
   compression while leaving the other parts such as opcode, payload
   length, the Extension Data part untouched.

Internet-Draft    WebSocket Per-frame DEFLATE Extension        July 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   _This section is non-normative._

   The WebSocket protocol is designed to allow for extensions
   [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol].  This enables use of
   compression extension to reduce the amount of data to be sent over
   network.

   The WebSocket protocol specification contains built-in compression
   extension "deflate-stream" that applies DEFLATE to everything
   including header octets such as opcode and payload length.  It's
   simple, however it requires intermediaries that are not interested in
   the contents of the Application Data part to decompress received
   octets using DEFLATE to see opcode, etc.

1.2.  Extension Overview

   _This section is non-normative._

   Per-frame DEFLATE extension adds another DEFLATE [RFC1951] based
   compression option to the WebSocket protocol.  Per-frame DEFLATE
   extension compresses only the octets in the Application Data part of
   a frame.  Header octets are unchanged by this extension.

   To align the end of compressed data to octet boundary, this extension
   uses the algorithm described in the Section 2.1 of the PPP Deflate
   Protocol [RFC1979].  The frame sender keeps using the same LZ77
   sliding window across multiple frames [LZ77].

   This extension doesn't use any of reserved bits, opcodes or Extension
   Data part.

   The simplest "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header in the opening
   handshake from the client that negotiates only per-frame DEFLATE
   extension is the following:

        Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: deflate-application-data

   The server also sends the same header to accept the use of this
   compression extension.

2.  Conformance Requirements

   Everything in this specification except for sections explicitly
   marked non-normative is normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Extension Negotiation

   The registered extension token for this extension is
   "deflate-application-data".

   To use per-frame DEFLATE extension, a user-agent MUST send an opening
   handshake request with the "deflate-application-data" extension token
   included in its "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header.

   The user-agent MUST NOT attach any extension parameter to
   "deflate-application-data" extension token in the opening handshake
   request.

   To accept use of per-frame DEFLATE extension requested by the user-
   agent, a server MUST send an opening handshake response with the
   "deflate-application-data" extension token included in its
   "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header.  Any extension parameter MUST NOT
   be attached to the token.

   The server MUST ignore any extension parameter attached to
   "deflate-application-data" extension token in the opening handshake
   request.

   The user-agent MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_ if any extension
   parameter is attached to "deflate-application-data" extension token
   in the opening handshake response.

   Once per-frame DEFLATE extension is accepted, both endpoints MUST use
   the algorithm described in Section 4 in sending frames.

4.  Detailed Specification

   This extension does not use any of reserved bits, opcodes or the
   Extension Data part in a WebSocket frame.

   This extension operates only on Data Frames, and only on the
   Application Data therein (it does not affect the Extension Data
   portion of the Payload Data).

   A sender using this extension MUST compress all octets of the
   Application Data part using DEFLATE [RFC1951].  The sender MAY use
   multiple blocks to compress data for one frame.  The sender MAY use
   blocks with any effective "BTYPE" defined in [RFC1951] for one frame.
   The sender MAY end a DEFLATE data set at arbitrary point by using a
   block with "BFINAL" bit set and continue to compress the rest by
   starting a new DEFLATE data set.  The sender MUST use the algorithm
   described in the Data paragraph of the Section 2.1 of the PPP Deflate
   Protocol [RFC1979] to align the end of the compressed data to an
   octet boundary if the compressed data for one frame doesn't end at an
   octet boundary.  That is that the sender MUST append an empty
   uncompressed block to the tail of the compressed data, and then
   remove 4 octets from the tail of the concatenated data.  When the
   compressed data for one frame ends at an octet boundary, the sender
   MUST append 0x00 to the tail of the compressed data to allow
   receivers to use the same algorithm to uncompress received data (See
   the algorithm for receiver below).  The sender MUST put this data
   (the octets left after appending and/or removing octets) in the
   Application Data part instead of the original data.  The payload
   length field of the frame MUST be the number of octets in the
   Extension Data part and the Application Data part after this process.
   The senders MAY keep using the same LZ77 sliding window across
   multiple frames [LZ77].

   A receiver using this extension MUST append 4 octets of 0x00 0x00
   0xff 0xff to the tail of the received octets in the Application Data
   part and decompress the concatenated octets using DEFLATE to get the
   original octets for the Application Data part.  The receiver MUST
   keep using the same LZ77 sliding window for all frames on the same
   WebSocket connection.  The receiver MUST use 32768 byte LZ77 sliding
   window.  When a DEFLATE data set ends at any point, the receiver MUST
   take the rest as a new DEFLATE data set and continue to uncompress
   it.

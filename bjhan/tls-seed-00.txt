INTERNET DRAFT         SEED Cipher Suites to TLS           June 15, 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies cipher suites for the Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC5246] protocol to support the SEED [RFC4269]
   encryption algorithm as a block cipher algorithm. The cipher suites
   include variants using the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash
   functions and SEED Galois counter mode.  Elliptic curve cipher suites
   and pre-shared key (PSK) cipher suites are also defined. 

   The cipher suites with SHA-1 are not included in this document.  Due
   to recent analytic work on SHA-1 [Wang05], the IETF is gradually
   moving away from SHA-1 and towards stronger hash algorithms. 

   The SEED cipher suites for TLS 1.0 originally specified in [RFC4162]
   This document obsoletes RFC 4162.

1.1.  SEED 

   SEED is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was developed by Korea
   Internet & Security Agency (KISA) and a group of experts, beginning
   in 1998.  The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the key
   length is also 128-bit.  SEED has the 16-round Feistel structure.  A
   128-bit input is divided into two 64-bit blocks and the right 64-bit
   block is an input to the round function with a 64-bit subkey
   generated from the key scheduling.

   SEED is easily implemented in various software and hardware because
   it is designed to increase the efficiency of memory storage and the
   simplicity of generating keys without degrading the security of the
   algorithm.  In particular, it can be effectively adopted in a
   computing environment that has a restricted resources such as mobile
   devices, smart cards, and so on. 

   SEED is a national industrial association standard [TTASSEED] and is
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial
   services operated on wired & wireless PKI. The SEED homepage,
   http://seed.kisa.or.kr/eng/about/about.jsp, contains a wealth of
   information about SEED, including detailed specification, evaluation
   report, test vectors, and so on.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

INTERNET DRAFT         SEED Cipher Suites to TLS           June 15, 2011


2.  Proposed Cipher Suites

2.1.  HMAC-Based Cipher Suites

   The first ten cipher suites use SEED0 [RFC4269] in Cipher Block
   Chaining (CBC) mode with a SHA-2 family Hashed Message Authentication
   Code (HMAC). Eight out of twenty use elliptic curves.

   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256         = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256      = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256      = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };

   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256 = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256    = { TBD,TBD };

2.2.  GCM-Based Cipher Suites

   The next ten cipher suites use the same asymmetric algorithms as
   those in the previous section but use the authenticated encryption
   modes defined in TLS 1.2 with the SEED in Galois Counter Mode
   (GCM)[GCM].

   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256         = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256      = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256      = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };

   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256 = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256    = { TBD,TBD };

INTERNET DRAFT         SEED Cipher Suites to TLS           June 15, 2011


2.3.  PSK Cipher Suites

   The next seven cipher suites describe PSK cipher suites. Four cipher
   suites use an HMAC and three cipher suites use the SEED Galois
   Counter Mode.

   CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256         = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256         = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_SEED_128_GCM_SHA256     = { TBD,TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_SEED_128_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };

3.  Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1.  Key Exchange

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, DH_anon, ECDH, and ECDHE
   key exchanges are performed as defined in [RFC5246].

3.2.  Cipher

   The SEED_128_CBC cipher suites use SEED [RFC4269] in CBC mode with a
   128-bit key and 128-bit Initialization Vector (IV)

   AES-authenticated encryption with additional data algorithms,
   AEAD_AES_128_GCM is described in [RFC5116]. AES GCM cipher suites for
   TLS are described in [RFC5288].  AES and SEED share common
   characteristics, including key sizes and block length. SEED_128_GCM
   is defined according to those characteristics of AES.

3.3.  PRFs

   The pseudorandom functions (PRFs) SHALL be as follows:

      a. For cipher suites ending with _SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF 
         [RFC5246] using SHA-256 as the hash function.

      b. For cipher suites ending with _SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF
         [RFC5246] using SHA-384 as the hash function.

3.4.  PSK Cipher Suites

   Pre-shared key cipher suites for TLS are described in [RFC4279],
   [RFC4785], [RFC5487], and [RFC5489].

4.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document, no security problem has been
   found on SEED. SEED is robust against known attacks, including
   differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, and related key
   attacks, etc. SEED has gone through wide public scrutinizing
   procedures. Especially, it has been evaluated and also considered
   cryptographically secure by trustworthy organizations such as ISO/IEC
   JTC 1/SC 27 and Japan CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and Evaluation
   Committees) [ISOSEED] [CRYPTREC].  SEED has been standardized at
   ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 (ISO/IEC 18033-3). 

   For further security considerations, the reader is encouraged to read
   [SEED-EVAL].

   The security considerations in the following RFCs apply to this
   document as well: [RFC4279] [RFC4785] [RFC5116] [RFC5288] [RFC5289]
   [RFC5487] and [GCM].

   Suite Registry:

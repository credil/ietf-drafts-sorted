1. Introduction

   It has been a common practice to encode Time to Live (TTL) for the
   IP multicast packets that have link-local scope,

   There has not been any standard document that specified the TTL
   value for the IPv4 multicast packets (such as the ones belonging to
   the protocols listed below) that have link-local scope, even though
   a common practice has been to encode the smallest Time to Live (TTL)
   value (=1).

Internet-Draft        TTL/Hop Limit in Multicast             March 2011


   o  LDP Discovery

   This document specifies the IPv4 TTL value for such link-local
   multicast packets.

   Note: This document does not define any behavior for link-local
   scope IP unicast packets.

2. Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. TTL Value

   This document specifies that any protocol generating link-local IPv4
   multicast packets must encode the corresponding TTL value to be one
   (= 1).

   IPv6 Neighbor Discover (ND) [RFC4861] is excluded from this for
   historic reasons (see below).

4. Security Considerations

   This specification improves the security of many link-local
   protocols.

5. IANA Considerations

   None.

6. Conclusions

   This document specifies the value = 1 for IPv4 TTL to be used on IP
   multicast packets that are not meant to be forwarded beyond the
   first hop.

7. Appendix

7.1. Discussion TTL=1 or TTL=255

   The use of a TTL=1 for link-local-scope IP multicast packets evolved
   out of the logic that link-local-scope networks have a hop-count of

   1 and that limiting the TTL of such packets to 1 did provide
   appropriate protection against such packets leaking to other
   subnets.

   GTSM was introduced for unicast packets first, specifying a TTL of
   255 and filtering of packets with a TTL smaller than 255 on receipt.
   This was used as a mean to protect against attackers from other
   networks sending packets with a TTL just large enough that it would
   end up as a TTL of 1 on the target network.

   Attacks such as those that GTSM protects against are not possible
   with link-local scope IP multicast packets because all devices that
   forward IP multicast packets and decrement the TTL are IP multicast
   routers that do not forward link-local scope IP multicast packets at
   all. There is no indication that any devices exist that break this
   standard behavior. If one would choose to recommend GTSM for link-
   local IP multicast packets on the premise of unknown devices, then
   one should even more be concerned about unknown devices forwarding
   link-local IP multicast packets without decrementing the TTL.

   In IPv6 ND, a TTL of 255 is used, based on the early premise that
   link-local-scope in IPv6 could optionally include networks with more
   than one hop. This premise was later dropped, so the use of TTL=255
   in ND is mostly for historic reasons.

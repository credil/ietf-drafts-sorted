Abstract 

   This document specifies PT-EAP, a Posture Broker Protocol identical 
   to the Trusted Computing Group's IF-T Protocol Bindings for Tunneled 
   EAP Methods (also known as EAP-TNC). The document then evaluates PT-
   EAP against the requirements defined in the NEA Requirements and PB-
   TNC specifications.

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies PT-EAP, a Posture Transport Protocol (PT) 
   identical to the Trusted Computing Group's IF-T Protocol Bindings for 
   Tunneled EAP Methods (also known as EAP-TNC) [12].  The document then 
   evaluates PT-EAP against the requirements defined in the NEA 
   Requirements [9] and PB-TNC specifications [4]. 

   The PT protocol in the NEA architecture is responsible for 
   transporting PB-TNC batches (often containing PA-TNC [3] attributes) 
   across the network between the NEA Client and NEA Server.  The PT 
   protocol also offers strong security protections to ensure the 
   exchanged messages are protected from a variety of threats from 
   hostile intermediaries.

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

   NEA protocols are intended to be used both for pre-admission 
   assessment of endpoints joining the network and to assess endpoints 
   already present on the network.  In order to support both usage 
   models, two types of PT protocols are needed.  One type of PT 
   operates after the endpoint has an assigned IP address, layering on 
   top of the IP protocol to carry a NEA exchange.  The other type of PT 
   operates before the endpoint gains any access to the IP network. This 
   specification defines PT-EAP, the PT protocol used to assess 
   endpoints before they gain access to the network. 

   PT-EAP is comprised of two related protocols, an outer EAP tunnel 
   method (not defined in this specification) and an inner EAP method 
   that carries the NEA assessment inside the protections of the outer 
   EAP tunnel method.  This specification uses the term PT-EAP to refer 
   to both collectively.  The inner EAP method is based upon a method 
   submitted by the Trusted Computing Group's TNC architecture and 
   standards so the inner EAP method is named EAP-TNC.  This 
   specification defines the EAP-TNC inner EAP method, while allowing 
   the EAP tunnel method to be specified in another specification 
   (possibly defined by another IETF WG). The reason to define PT-EAP as 
   including both the outer EAP tunnel method and the inner EAP method 
   is because both are required to meet the PT requirements. 

   EAP-TNC is designed to operate as an inner EAP [10] method over an 
   EAP tunnel method that meets the Requirements for a Tunnel Based EAP 
   Method [17]. PT-EAP therefore can operate over a number of existing 
   access protocols that support EAP for authentication. Some examples 
   of such access protocols include 802.1X [7] for wired and wireless 
   networks and IKEv2 [15] for establishing VPNs over IP networks. 

   This document defines a standard EAP inner method called EAP-TNC.  It 
   also shows how EAP-TNC may be carried over two existing EAP tunnel 
   EAP methods: EAP-FAST [14] and EAP-TTLS [16]. 

1.1. Prerequisites 

   This document does not define an architecture or reference model.  
   Instead, it defines a protocol that works within the reference model 
   described in the NEA Requirements specification [9].  The reader is 
   assumed to be thoroughly familiar with that document.  No familiarity 
   with Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specifications is assumed. 

1.2. Message Diagram Conventions 

   This specification defines the syntax of EAP-TNC messages using 
   diagrams.  Each diagram depicts the format and size of each field in 
   bits.  Implementations MUST send the bits in each diagram as they are 
 
 
Hanna                    Expires July 4, 2010                  [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

   shown, traversing the diagram from top to bottom and then from left 
   to right within each line (which represents a 32-bit quantity).  
   Multi-byte fields representing numeric values must be sent in network 
   (big endian) byte order. 

   Descriptions of bit field (e.g. flag) values are described referring 
   to the position of the bit within the field.  These bit positions are 
   numbered from the most significant bit through the least significant 
   bit so a one octet field with only bit 0 set has the value 0x80. 

1.3. Terminology 

   This document reuses many terms defined in the NEA Requirements 
   document [9], such as Posture Transport Client and Posture Transport 
   Server. The reader is assumed to have read that document and 
   understood it. 

   When defining the EAP-TNC method, this specification does not use the 
   terms "EAP peer" and "EAP authenticator". Instead, it uses the terms 
   "NEA Client" and "NEA Server" since those are considered to be more 
   familiar to NEA WG participants. However, these terms are equivalent 
   for the purposes of these specifications. The part of the NEA Client 
   that terminates EAP-TNC (generally in the Posture Transport Client) 
   is the EAP peer for EAP-TNC. The part of the NEA Server that 
   terminates EAP-TNC (generally in the Posture Transport Server) is the 
   EAP authenticator for EAP-TNC. 

1.4. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]. 

2. Use of EAP-TNC 

   EAP-TNC is designed to encapsulate PB-TNC batches in a simple EAP 
   method that can be carried within EAP tunnel methods. The EAP tunnel 
   methods provide confidentiality and message integrity, so EAP-TNC 
   does not have to do so. Therefore, EAP-TNC MUST only be used inside 
   an EAP tunnel method that provides strong cryptographic 
   authentication (possibly server only), message integrity and 
   confidentiality services. 

3. Definition of EAP-TNC 

   The EAP-TNC protocol operates between a Posture Transport Client and 
   a Posture Transport Server, allowing them to send PB-TNC batches to

   each other over an EAP tunnel method. When EAP-TNC is used, the 
   Posture Transport Client in the NEA reference model acts as an EAP 
   peer (terminating the EAP-TNC method on the endpoint) and the Posture 
   Transport Server acts as an EAP authenticator (terminating the EAP-
   TNC method on the NEA Server). 

   This section describes and defines the EAP-TNC method. First, it 
   provides a protocol overview and a flow diagram. Second, it describes 
   specific features like version negotiation and fragmentation. Third, 
   it gives a detailed packet description. Finally, it describes the 
   Diffie-Hellman Pre-Negotiation (DH-PN) feature, which allows the EAP-
   TNC implementations on the NEA Client and NEA Server to derive a key 
   from the EAP-TNC exchange.  This key may be used to cryptographically 
   bind the EAP-TNC exchange to the EAP tunnel method, defeating MITM 
   attacks. 

3.1. Protocol Overview 

   EAP-TNC has two phases that follow each other in strict sequence: 
   negotiation and data transport. 

   The EAP-TNC method begins with the negotiation phase.  The NEA Server 
   starts this phase by sending an EAP-TNC Start message: an EAP Request 
   message of type EAP-TNC with the S (Start) flag set. The NEA Server 
   may set the D flag in the Start message if it wants to engage in 
   Diffie-Hellman Pre-Negotiation (D-H PN for short).  If the D flag is 
   set, the NEA Client MAY respond by starting D-H PN.  If the NEA 
   Client does not support D-H PN or wishes to skip it, the NEA Client 
   ignores the D flag and the Start message is the last step in the 
   negotiation phase.  If the NEA Client and NEA Server do engage in D-H 
   PN, that is the last step in the negotiation phase. In either case, 
   the negotiation phase ends with a message from the NEA Server to the 
   NEA Client. 

   The data transport phase is the only phase of EAP-TNC where PB-TNC 
   batches are allowed to be exchanged.  This phase always starts with 
   the NEA Client sending a PB-TNC batch to the NEA Server.  The NEA 
   Client and NEA Server then engage in a round-robin exchange with one 
   PB-TNC batch in flight at a time.  The data transport phase always 
   ends with an EAP Response message from the NEA Client to the NEA 
   Server.  This message may be empty (not contain any data) if the NEA 
   Server has just sent the last PB-TNC batch in the PB-TNC exchange. 

   At the end of the EAP-TNC method, the NEA Server will indicate 
   success or failure to the EAP tunnel method.  Some EAP tunnel methods 
   may provide explicit confirmation of inner method success; others may 
   not.  This is out of scope for the EAP-TNC method.  Successful

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

   completion of EAP-TNC does not imply successful completion of the 
   overall authentication nor does EAP-TNC failure imply overall 
   failure. This depends on the administrative policy in place. 

   The NEA Server and NEA Client may engage in an abnormal termination 
   of the EAP-TNC exchange at any time by simply stopping the exchange. 
   This may also require terminating the EAP tunnel method, depending on 
   the capabilities of the EAP tunnel method. 

   The NEA Server and NEA Client MUST follow the protocol sequence 
   described in this section. 

3.2. Version Negotiation 

   EAP-TNC version negotiation takes place in the first EAP-TNC message 
   sent by the NEA Server (the Start message) and the first EAP-TNC sent 
   by the NEA Client (the response to the Start message). The NEA Server 
   MUST set the Version field in the Start message to the maximum EAP-
   TNC version that the NEA Server supports and is willing to accept. 

   The NEA Client chooses the EAP-TNC version to be used for the 
   exchange and places this value in the Version field in its response 
   to the Start message. The NEA Client SHOULD choose the value sent by 
   the NEA Server if the NEA Client supports it. However, the NEA Client 
   MAY set the Version field to a value less than the value sent by the 
   NEA Server (for example, if the NEA Client only supports lesser EAP-
   TNC versions). If the NEA Client only supports EAP-TNC versions 
   greater than the value sent by the NEA Server, the EAP client MUST 
   abnormally terminate the EAP negotiation. 

   If the version sent by the NEA Client is not acceptable to the NEA 
   Server, the NEA Server MUST terminate the EAP-TNC session 
   immediately.  Otherwise, the version sent by the NEA Client is the 
   version of EAP-TNC that MUST be used. Both the NEA Client and the NEA 
   Server MUST set the Version field to the chosen version number in all 
   subsequent EAP-TNC messages in this exchange. 

   This specification defines version 1 of EAP-TNC.  Version 0 is 
   reserved and MUST never be sent. New versions of EAP-TNC (values 2-7) 
   may be defined by Standards Action, as defined in RFC 5226 [8]. 

3.3. Fragmentation 

   In most cases, EAP-TNC fragmentation will not be required. But PB-TNC 
   batches can be very long and EAP message length is sometimes tightly 
   constrained so EAP-TNC includes a fragmentation mechanism to be used 

 
 
Hanna                    Expires July 4, 2010                  [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

   when a particular PB-TNC batch is too long to fit into a single EAP-
   TNC message. 

   The fragmentation mechanism used in EAP-TNC is quite similar to the 
   mechanism used by EAP-TLS [18], EAP-TTLS, and EAP-FAST [14]. It uses 
   the L flag (length included) and the M flag (more fragments) as well 
   as the Data Length field. 

   A party (NEA Client or NEA Server) that needs to fragment a long PB-
   TNC batch SHOULD break the batch into pieces (called "fragments") 
   that will fit into EAP-TNC messages. Then this party sends the 
   fragments in proper sequence, one fragment per EAP-TNC message.  The 
   receiving party recognizes the fragments and holds them for 
   reassembly, sending an acknowledgment for each fragment so that the 
   next fragment can be sent (since EAP only allows one message in 
   flight and is half duplex). 

   The EAP-TNC message that contains the first fragment MUST have the L 
   flag set to indicate that fragmentation is being initiated. This 
   packet also MUST contain the Data Length field, indicating the total 
   octet length of the unfragmented batch and allowing the party 
   receiving the fragments to know how much data will eventually be 
   coming. The L flag MUST NOT be set and the Data Length field MUST NOT 
   be present in any EAP-TNC message unless that message contains the 
   first fragment of a fragmented PB-TNC batch. The M flag MUST be set 
   on all but the last fragment and MUST NOT be set on the last 
   fragment. 

   A party that receives an EAP-TNC message with the M flag set MUST 
   respond with an EAP-TNC Acknowledgement message: an EAP-TNC message 
   with no Data and with the L, M, and S flags set to 0. The party that 
   sent an EAP-TNC message with the M flag set MUST wait for the EAP-TNC 
   Acknowledgement packet before sending the next fragment. 

   EAP-TNC authenticators and NEA Clients MUST include support for EAP-
   TNC fragmentation with Data Lengths up to 100,000 octets.  However, a 
   NEA Server or peer still MAY decide to terminate an EAP-TNC exchange 
   at any time for a variety of reasons. 

3.4. EAP-TNC Message Format 

   This section provides a detailed description of the fields in an EAP-
   TNC message.  For a description of the diagram conventions used here, 
   see section 1.2.  Since EAP-TNC is an EAP method, the first four 
   fields in each message are mandated by and defined in EAP.

   L: Length included 

      Indicates the presence of the Data Length field in the EAP-TNC 
      message. This flag MUST be set for an EAP-TNC message that 
      contains the first fragment of a fragmented EAP-TNC message and 
      only for such a message. This flag MUST NOT be set for non-
      fragmented messages. 

   M: More fragments 

      Indicates that more fragments are to follow. This flag MUST be set 
      for all EAP-TNC messages that contain a fragmented EAP-TNC message 
      except that this bit MUST NOT be set for EAP-TNC messages that 
      contain the last fragment of a fragmented message. This flag MUST 
      NOT be set for EAP-TNC messages that contain unfragmented Data. 

   S: Start 

      Indicates the beginning of an EAP-TNC exchange. This flag MUST be 
      set only for the first message from the NEA Server. If the S flag 
      is set, the EAP message MUST NOT contain Data or have the L or M 
      flags set. 

   D: Diffie-Hellman Pre-Negotiation 

      Indicates the use of a Diffie-Hellman (D-H) based exchange to 
      provide key derivation.  See section 3.6 for specifics of when to 
      set this flag and how to handle it. 

   R: Reserved 

      This flag MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon receipt. 

   Version 

      This field is used for version negotiation, as described in 
      section 3.2.  

   Data Length 

      Data Length is an optional field four octets in length. It MUST be 
      present if and only if the L flag is set. When present, it 
      indicates the total length, before fragmentation, of a fragmented 
      PB-TNC batch. The Data Length field MUST be set in the EAP-TNC 
      message that contains the first in a series of fragments and MUST 
      NOT be set in subsequent fragments.

   Data 

      Variable length data. The length of the Data field in a particular 
      EAP-TNC message may be determined by subtracting the length of the 
      EAP-TNC header fields from the value of the two octet Length 
      field. Note, however, that this data may only be part of a longer 
      fragmented PB-TNC batch conveyed in multiple EAP-TNC messages. 

3.5. Diffie-Hellman (D-H) Pre-Negotiation 

   This section describes the optional Diffie-Hellman Pre-Negotiation 
   feature of EAP-TNC (known as D-H PN).  The D-H PN feature allows the 
   EAP-TNC implementations on the NEA Client and NEA Server to derive a 
   key from the EAP-TNC exchange.  This key may be used to 
   cryptographically bind the EAP-TNC exchange to the EAP tunnel method, 
   defeating MITM attacks such as those described in section 4.2.5.  

   All EAP-TNC implementations on NEA Servers MUST support D-H PN.  EAP-
   TNC implementations on NEA Clients MAY support D-H PN.  However, 
   administrative configuration and policy SHOULD determine whether this 
   feature is disabled, permitted, or required. 

   D-H PN was designed to enable it to be added without causing backward 
   compatibility issues.  Legacy clients only supporting IF-T Protocol 
   Bindings for Tunneled EAP Methods 1.0 are required to ignore the use 
   of the D flag. D-H PN was added in version 1.1 of that protocol.  As 
   a result the NEA Server (which initiates a D-H PN request) can not 
   assume the Posture Transport Client will support DH-PN.  Therefore 
   the Posture Transport Server MUST wait until the Posture Transport 
   Client has sent a message indicating it supports D-H PN (D flag set) 
   before sending messages with the D-H PN described below.  This 
   decision causes a full roundtrip to occur prior to exchanging D-H PN 
   messages. 

3.5.1. Use of D Flag 

   The use of the "D" flag in the EAP-TNC header MUST follow very strict 
   rules described in Section 3.4.  If the D flag is one (1), this 
   indicates the data field of the EAP-TNC message MUST only contain the 
   pre-negotiation information or be empty (as in the initial exchange 
   messages) and not contain PB-TNC batches.  PB-TNC batches MUST NOT be 
   included in messages with the D flag set to one (1).  Either entity 
   MAY set the D flag to 0 at any time indicating it does not wish to 
   (or is incapable of) perform the D-H PN exchange.  The other party 
   MAY then determine whether to proceed with the dialog without a D-H 
   PN exchange.

3.5.2. D-H Pre-Negotiation Message Syntax 

   This section describes the format of the data field within each of 
   the four D-H PN messages exchanged.  These messages are only present 
   in the data field when the D flag is set to one. The D flag MUST be 
   set for all D-H PN messages.  If the NEA Client or NEA Server 
   receives a message with the D flag set to zero in the middle of a D-H 
   PN exchange, it SHOULD interpret this as meaning that the sender has 
   decided to terminate the D-H PN exchange but would like to proceed 
   with the NEA exchange. The recipient MAY proceed or terminate the 
   entire NEA exchange.  The messages are presented in the order they 
   would appear in a D-H PN message exchange. 

3.5.2.1. D-H PN Hello Request Format 

   The data field of the initial D-H PN message from the NEA Server MUST 
   be empty for backward compatibility.  This message occurs at the 
   start of a session with the start flag set to one and the D flag set 
   to one (indicating a desire to initiate D-H PN without sending a data 
   field that would be confusing to legacy NEA Clients that might ignore 
   the D flag.) 

3.5.2.2. D-H PN Hello Response Format 

   The data field of the initial response from the Posture Transport 
   Client allows a NEA Client to notify the Posture Transport Server 
   that it is able and willing to perform a D-H PN (by replying with the 
   D flag set to one.)  The defined protocol expects the NEA Server to 
   lead the negotiation except for the D-H group which needs to be 
   negotiated before the public value exchange can occur (since it 
   affects the size.)  In order to reduce the number of messages 
   required, this message includes the set of supported/preferred D-H 
   groups and any minimum nonce size.

   D-H Group    

      Flag field indicating the supported D-H groups.  See section 
      3.5.5. for description of the D-H groups and their representation 
      in this field.  The NEA Client policy MAY dictate what groups are 
      allowable for a particular NEA Server.

   Min Nonce Len   

      NEA Client can send a minimum acceptable length for the nonce in 
      bytes.  This value should be set to zero if there is no minimum 
      required. 

3.5.2.3. D-H PN Parameters Request Format  

   This is the data field of the NEA Server's request message trying to 
   finalize the negotiation of the parameters of the D-H PN exchange.  
   This message proposes the NEA Server's set of supported hash 
   algorithms.  The D-H group MUST be selected from the set offered in 
   the D-H PN Hello Response message.  If the NEA Server's policy does 
   not allow the use of any of the D-H groups offered by the NEA Client, 
   this MUST result in the unsuccessful termination of the D-H PN.  The 
   NEA Server MAY decide to continue with an EAP-TNC exchange without 
   the D-H PN protections by sending a message with the S or D flags set 
   to zero and an empty data field.  If the NEA Server decides to select 
   an offered D-H group, the Posture Transport Server can offer its D-H 
   public value (using the size from the selected group) and include a 
   nonce for freshness of the exchange in the following D-H PN 
   Parameters Request message.

      NEA Server.  See section 3.5.4. for a description of the defined 
      hash algorithms and their representation in this field. 

   Nonce Length 

      Length of the nonce field in bytes.  This value MUST be greater 
      than 16 and MUST be greater then or equal to the Min Nonce Len 
      specified by the NEA Client's D-H PN Hello Response message. 

   NEA Server Nonce (S-Nonce)  

      High entropy random data used to assure the freshness of the 
      session.  Nonces MUST NOT be repeated or be predictable by other 
      parties. 

   D-H Public Value   

      NEA Server's public value for this D-H exchange.  The size of this 
      field is determined by the Posture Transport Server selected D-H 
      group to use.  See section 3.5.5. for the lengths used for each D-
      H group. 

3.5.2.4. D-H PN Parameters Response Format  

   This section describes the data field of the NEA Client's parameter 
   response message that completes the D-H PN exchange.  This message 
   establishes the particular hash algorithm for the derivation.   
   Because the D-H group has been established, the Posture Transport 
   Client can offer its D-H public value and include a nonce for 
   freshness of the exchange.  When the Posture Transport Server 
   receives this message, both parties will have everything they need to 
   perform the remaining transforms to derive the shared secrets.

   D-H Public Value (C-Pub) 

      NEA Client's public value for this D-H exchange.  The size of this 
      field is indicated by the selected D-H group. 

   NEA Client Nonce (C-Nonce) 

      High entropy random data used to assure the freshness of the 
      session (nonces MUST NOT be repeated or be predictable.) 

3.5.3. Diffie-Hellman Pre-Negotiation Protocol 

   This section describes the message exchange protocol which occurs 
   during the D-H PN.  At any point during the exchange if a party is 
   unwilling to accept the options offered by the other party, it SHOULD 
   set the D flag to zero indicating it no longer wishes to continue the 
   D-H PN.  This MAY result in a fallback to a standard request/response 
   protocol if acceptable by both parties.  All D-H PN protocol messages 
   MUST have the D flag set to one. 

   The following sequence explains the details of the processing of each 
   D-H PN message carried by EAP and some background on how it provides 
   security against MiTM attacks: 

        1. Initially, the NEA Server sends an EAP-Request with the S 
          (Start) flag set to one to indicate the beginning of the 
          session.  The NEA Server SHOULD check policy to determine if 
          the NEA Client should be asked to use the D-H PN and if so 
          set the D (D-H PN) flag.  If the D-H PN flag is set, the 
          message MUST NOT contain data in the data section and is 
          known as a D-H PN Hello Request message.

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

        2. The NEA Client receives the D-H PN Hello Request message.  If 
          the NEA Client only supports version 1.0 of IF-T Protocol 
          Binding for Tunneled EAP Methods and therefore does not 
          recognize the D flag, it would ignore the D flag and try to 
          process the data section as a PB-TNC request message so it 
          MUST find no data field for backward compatibility.  The NEA 
          Client supports the D flag so it will perform the following: 

          a. If the D flag is zero, the NEA Client MUST NOT respond with 
             a message with the D flag set to one. Instead, it MAY 
             terminate the exchange if it requires a D-H PN but will 
             usually proceed with EAP-TNC without D-H PN. 

          b. If the D flag is one, the NEA Client MAY consult policy to 
             decide whether to respond with the D-H PN Hello Response 
             message indicating a willingness to perform a D-H PN.  If 
             willing to use D-H PN, the NEA Client includes a set of 
             acceptable D-H groups and any minimum nonce lengths it 
             requires. The NEA Client MAY decline to perform D-H PN by 
             sending an EAP-TNC message with the D flag set to zero.  In 
             this case, the NEA Server MAY proceed with a NEA exchange 
             unprotected by D-H PN or terminate the entire NEA exchange. 

        3. If the NEA Server receives the D-H PN Hello Response message, 
          this indicates an ability and willingness to perform a D-H PN 
          by the NEA Client.  The NEA Server sends a D-H PN Parameters 
          Request message selecting a D-H group from those offered by 
          the NEA Client.  This message also indicates its set of 
          supported hash algorithms, and the NEA Server's public value 
          and freshness nonce. 

        4. The NEA Client responds with a D-H PN Parameters Response 
          Message.  This message MUST select a hash algorithm from the 
          offered set.  If no acceptable options were offered the NEA 
          Client SHOULD respond with a message with the D flag set to 
          zero and proceed with an EAP-TNC response (to the Start 
          message) without D-H PN protection.  The NEA Client also 
          sends its D-H public value corresponding to the selected D-H 
          group and a freshness nonce. 

        5. The NEA Server receives the D-H PN Parameters Response 
          message and assures the response is consistent with its 
          request message and meets its policy.   

   At this point the NEA Client and NEA Server compute the shared secret 
   key using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.  Passive MiTM listeners can 
   not determine the key value, although an active MiTM that

   participates in the D-H PN exchange and acts as a proxy between the 
   true NEA Client and NEA Server could share keys with each party.  In 
   the proxy case, the true NEA Client and NEA Server do not share a 
   common secret key (they each only share a secret with the MiTM 
   proxy.)  To detect this style of attack, the NEA Client uses a 
   byproduct (Unique-Value-1) of the secret key and both nonces later in 
   a computation of a quiz answer sent in an PA-TNC attribute request 
   during the assessment.  Because the true NEA Client and NEA Server 
   know different D-H values, the true NEA Client computes a different 
   quiz result than what is expected by the NEA Server so the assessment 
   fails. 

   Both parties compute the following: 

        6.Compute Unique-Value-1 = HASH ("1" | C-Nonce | S-Nonce | D-H 
          Shared Secret Key)  The NEA Client saves Unique-Value-1 for 
          later use with the PA-TNC quiz requests.  If the value length 
          is >20 bytes (e.g. when the selected HASH is SHA-256), the 
          value MUST be truncated to the 20 most significant bytes.  
          Later when the NEA Client is asked to produce a quiz result 
          during the PA-TNC assessment, this value is used in the 
          computation (e.g. hashed with other posture information).  
          The NEA Server can also compute Unique-Value-1 and the quiz 
          result so can recognize a correct response.  Note that 
          Unique-Value-1 isn't the actual secret key used to protect 
          traffic. 

        7. Next, the NEA Client and NEA Server compute the following 
          value that will be used later by EAP-TNC: 

            Unique-Value-2 = HASH ("2" | C-Nonce | S-Nonce | D-H Shared 
            Secret Key) 

        8. After the completion of the D-H PN protocol, both entities 
          MUST set the D flag to zero and then use the data field to 
          exchange PB-TNC batches.  The NEA Server will start by 
          sending an EAP-TNC message with no Data and the D and S flags 
          set to zero. The NEA Client will respond with an EAP-TNC 
          message containing its first PB-TNC batch. 

        9. When a D-H PN has successfully completed, the NEA Client and 
          NEA Server MUST compute a running hash (using the selected 
          algorithm) including the complete contents (from the Code 
          field through the Data field, inclusive) of each EAP-TNC 
          message sent/received in sequence during the assessment.  
          This running hash is performed by repeated use of the 
          following after receiving or sending an EAP-TNC Message:

            Unique-Value-2 = HASH (Unique-Value-2 | HASH (EAP-TNC 
            Message)) 

        10. The result (final Unique-Value-2) is a value that is 
          cryptographically computed from the D-H PN secret key, nonce 
          pair and the contents of all of the messages exchanged (thus 
          all the posture information responses.) 

        11. At the completion of the EAP-TNC exchanges when the D-H PN 
          has been used, the final Unique-Value-2 MUST be exported and 
          mixed into the EAP tunnel method's session keys.  An 
          additional EAP tunnel method round trip is required to assure 
          that NEA Client and NEA Server both computed the same value.  
          If this occurred, then both parties knew the secret D-H PN 
          key, nonce pair and observed the same set of EAP-TNC message 
          (thus allowing for detection of MiTM message tampering.)  If 
          both do not compute the same final Unique-Value-2, then the 
          final EAP tunnel method message exchange (cryptographic 
          binding check) will not properly decrypt, so the session MUST 
          be considered compromised. 

        12. Finally after the outer EAP tunnel method completes, it's 
          critical that the subsequent communications continue to be 
          protected from active attacks by a MiTM.  This SHOULD be 
          achieved by leveraging keys derived from the Unique-Value-2 
          known by both parties to encrypt and integrity protect future 
          traffic.  Wireless 802.1X has provisions for provisioning a 
          key for this purpose, but wired 802.1X requires an equivalent 
          mechanism (possibly part of 802.1AE.)

4. Security Considerations 

   This section discusses the major threats and countermeasures provided 
   by the EAP-TNC inner EAP method. As discussed throughout the 
   document, the EAP-TNC method is designed to run inside an EAP tunnel 
   method which is capable of protecting the EAP-TNC protocol from many 
   threats. 
4.1.  Trust Relationships 

   In order to understand where security countermeasures are necessary, 
   this section starts with a discussion of where the NEA architecture 
   envisions some trust relationships between the processing elements of 
   the PT-EAP protocol.  The following sub-sections discuss the trust 
   properties associated with each portion of the NEA reference model 
   directly involved with the processing of the PT-TNC protocol. 

4.1.1. Posture Transport Client 

   The Posture Transport Client is trusted by the Posture Broker Client 
   to: 

   o  Not to observe, fabricate or alter the contents of the PB-TNC 
      batches received from the network 

   o  Not to observe, fabricate or alter the PB-TNC batches passed down 
      from the Posture Broker Client for transmission on the network 

   o  Transmit on the network any PB-TNC batches passed down from the 
      Posture Broker Client 

   o  Deliver properly security protected messages received from the 
      network that are destined for the Posture Broker Client 

   o  Provide configured security protections (e.g. authentication, 
      integrity and confidentiality) for the Posture Broker Client's PB-
      TNC batches sent on the network

   o  Not to ignore or drop messages causing issues for the protocol 
      processing

      the network to ensure the messages are authentic and protected

4.2. Security Threats and Countermeasures 

   Beyond the trusted relationships assumed in section 4.1. the PT-EAP 
   EAP method faces a number of potential security attacks that could 
   require security countermeasures. 

   Generally, the PT protocol is responsible for providing strong 
   security protections for all of the NEA protocols so any threats to 
   PT's ability to protect NEA protocol messages could be very damaging 
   to deployments.  For the PT-EAP method, most of the cryptographic 
   security in provided by the outer EAP tunnel method and EAP-TNC is 
   encapsulated within the protected tunnel.   Therefore, this section 
   highlights the cryptographic requirements that need to be met by the 
   EAP tunnel method carrying EAP-TNC in order to meet the NEA PT 
   requirements.   

   Once the message is delivered to the Posture Broker Client or Posture 
   Broker Server, the posture brokers are trusted to properly safely 
   process the messages.

4.2.1. Message Theft 

   When EAP-TNC messages are sent over unprotected network links or 
   spanning local software stacks that are not trusted, the contents of 
   the messages may be subject to information theft by an intermediary 
   party.  This theft could result in information being recorded for 
   future use or analysis by the adversary.  Messages observed by 
   eavesdroppers could contain information that exposes potential 
   weaknesses in the security of the endpoint, or system fingerprinting 
   information easing the ability of the attacker to employ attacks more 
   likely to be successful against the endpoint.  The eavesdropper might 
   also learn information about the endpoint or network policies that 
   either singularly or collectively is considered sensitive 
   information.  For example, if EAP-TNC is housed in an EAP tunnel 
   method that does not provide confidentiality protection, an adversary 
   could observe the PA-TNC attributes included in the PB-TNC batch and 
   determine that the endpoint is lacking patches, or particular sub-
   networks have more lenient policies. 

   In order to protect again NEA assessment message theft, the EAP 
   tunnel method carrying EAP-TNC MUST provide strong cryptographic 
   authentication, integrity and confidentiality protection.  The use of 
   bi-directional authentication in the EAP tunnel method carrying EAP-
   TNC ensures that only properly authenticated and authorized parties 
   may be involved in an assessment message exchange.  When EAP-TNC is 
   carried with a cryptographically protected EAP tunnel method like 
   EAP-TTLS, all of the PB-TNC and PA-TNC protocol messages contents are 
   hidden from potential theft by intermediaries lurking on the network. 

4.2.2. Message Fabrication 

   Attackers on the network or present within the NEA system could 
   introduce fabricated PT-EAP messages intending to trick or create a 
   denial of service against aspects of an assessment.  For example, an 
   adversary could attempt to insert into the message exchange fake PT-
   EAP error codes in order to disrupt communications. 

   The EAP tunnel method carrying an EAP-TNC method needs to provide 
   strong security protections for the complete message exchange over 
   the network.  These security protections prevent an intermediary from 
   being able to insert fake messages into the assessment.  For example, 
   the EAP-TTLS method's use of hashing algorithms provides strong 
   integrity protections that allow for detection of any changes in the 
   content of the message exchange.  Additionally, adversaries are 
   unable to observe the EAP-TNC method housed inside of an encrypting 
   EAP tunnel method (e.g. EAP-TTLS) because the messages are encrypted 
   by the TLS [2] ciphers, so an attacker would have difficulty in

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

   determining where to insert the falsified message, since the attacker 
   is unable to determine where the message boundaries exist. 

4.2.3. Message Modification 

   This attack could allow an active attacker capable of intercepting a 
   message to modify a PT-EAP message or transported PA-TNC attribute to 
   a desired value to ease the compromise of an endpoint.  Without the 
   ability for message recipients to detect whether a received message 
   contains the same content as what was originally sent, active 
   attackers can stealthily modify the attribute exchange. 

   The EAP-TNC method leverages the EAP tunnel method (e.g. EAP-TTLS) to 
   provide strong authentication and integrity protections as a 
   countermeasure to this threat.  The bi-directional authentication 
   prevents the attacker from acting as an active man-in-the-middle to 
   the protocol that could be used to modify the message exchange.  The 
   strong integrity protections (hashing) offered by EAP-TTLS allows the 
   EAP-TNC message recipients to detect message alterations by other 
   types of network based adversaries.  Because EAP-TNC does not itself 
   provide explicit integrity protection for the EAP-TNC payload, an EAP 
   tunnel method that offers strong integrity protection is required to 
   mitigate this threat. 

4.2.4. Denial of Service 

   A variety of types of denial of service attacks are possible against 
   the PT-EAP if the message exchange are left unprotected while 
   traveling over the network.   The Posture Transport Client and 
   Posture Transport Server are trusted not to participate in the denial 
   of service of the assessment session, leaving the threats to come 
   from the network. 

   The EAP-TNC method primarily relies on the outer EAP tunnel method to 
   provide strong authentication (at least of one party) and deployers 
   are expected to leverage other EAP methods to authenticate the other 
   party (typically the client) within the protected tunnel.  The use of 
   a protected bi-directional authentication will prevent unauthorized 
   parties from participating in a PT-EAP exchange.   

   After the cryptographic authentication by the EAP tunnel method, the 
   session can be encrypted and hashed to prevent undetected 
   modification that could create a denial of service situation.  
   However it is possible for an adversary to alter the message flows 
   causing each message to be rejected by the recipient because it fails 
   the integrity checking.

4.2.5. Nested Tunnel Attacks 

   The PT-EAP protocol works on the premise that the EAP tunnel method 
   is capable of carrying (and protecting) various inner methods that 
   perform additional security exchanges to establish the authenticity 
   and integrity of the endpoint.  While this model is very flexible 
   since it allows for the variety of existing EAP methods to be 
   leveraged within the tunnel, it may introduce vulnerabilities.  One 
   such vulnerability is an attack described in "Man-in-the-Middle 
   Attack against Tunneled Authentication Protocols" described in the 
   2003 Security Protocols Workshop paper by Asokan, Niemi, and Nyberg 
   [13].  This document will refer to the attack discussed by Asokan and 
   others as the "nested tunnel attack" for brevity. 

   The nested tunnel attack takes advantage of the fact that there is no 
   strong linkage between the outer EAP tunnel method and the inner EAP 
   method so a MiTM could be forwarding traffic learned from an earlier 
   unprotected observed authentication (or assessment) or actively 
   proxying an ongoing unprotected assessment. 

   For example, if a normally compliant and authorized enterprise laptop 
   (referred to as "laptop1") became infected with malware and wished to 
   access the enterprise network despite now being non-compliant the 
   following might occur: 

        1. Attacker sets up laptop2 with same software as on compliant 
          laptop1 (minus malware) and configures to provide posture to 
          laptop1 using NEA protocols. 

        2. When legitimate user attempts to join enterprise network with 
          laptop1, malware delays join and notifies the attacker who 
          triggers laptop2 to attempt to join network by sending 
          authentication and posture information to laptop1 (even 
          securely in an EAP tunnel). 

        3. Now armed with a NEA session to laptop2, laptop1 attempts to 
          join enterprise network with secure tunneled PT-EAP exchange 
          to enterprise's NEA Server 

        4. After EAP tunnel method establishes tunnel, NEA Server uses 
          EAP-TNC method to request laptop1 provide posture to join 
          network 

        5. Laptop1 relays posture requests over other EAP tunnel to 
          laptop2 (using EAP-TNC) who responds with compliant posture 
          information.

        6. Laptop1 relays the laptop2 responses to the enterprise NEA 
          Server 

        7. Steps 4-6 repeat as necessary 

        8. Enterprise NEA Server believes laptop1 is compliant with 
          policy despite it containing significant malware 

   This attack exploits the fact that the inner and outer EAP methods 
   are independent from each other since laptop1 is able to obtain 
   compliant posture information from laptop2 over a different tunnel 
   and re-use it.  In order to bind the inner and out methods together, 
   this specification includes a Diffie-Hellman Pre-Negotiation (D-H PN) 
   which creates a per-assessment freshness value.   

   When the D-H PN value is combined with a hash of the assessment 
   messages and the resulting value is exported and mixed into the outer 
   EAP tunnel method's keys, both parties can perform a simple roundtrip 
   confirmation message to ensure both know the D-H PN secret, the hash 
   of the assessment and the original outer tunnel methods encryption 
   key.  This cryptographically binds the one (or more) inner EAP 
   methods exporting keys with the outer tunnel method and provides more 
   freshness to the assessment session.  For details of D-H PN, see 
   section 3.5.  

   In addition, a special pair of PA-TNC attributes can be exchanged 
   after the D-H PN has completed that include a simple proof of 
   knowledge quiz that the intermediary is not able to easily solve with 
   information seen on the network.  For example, the NEA Server could 
   send a "quiz" question to the NEA Client where the response would 
   include a hash(D-H PN Secret, "quiz_answer").  The intermediary won't 
   know the D-H PN Secret if it wasn't involved in the D-H PN.  If it 
   was involved, it shouldn't be able to figure out the quiz answer 
   which involves a question about what a clean system should look like. 

   The countermeasure provide mitigation because if an active MiTM 
   (laptop1) takes part in the D-H PN it establishes shared values with 
   the enterprise NEA Server that aren't actually known by laptop2, so 
   can't be included in laptop2's exported keys or in the quiz answer.   

   If a MiTM (laptop1) just forwarded the D-H PN protocol over a tunnel 
   to laptop2 so that clean laptop2 and the enterprise NEA Server were 
   selecting the D-H values and nonces, laptop1 would be unable to 
   determine the established secret since it lacks knowledge of any D-H 
   private values and would be unable to complete the outer EAP tunnel 
   exchange once the secret was mixed into the session keys.

   In order for the MiTM protection to continue during the subsequent 
   communications on the network, the communications SHOULD protect the 
   data exchanges using keys based on the final EAP tunnel method keys 
   that were mixed with the D-H secret keys.  At present, 802.1X for 
   wireless use has provisions for such a key to be used.  However wired 
   802.1X lacks the use of keys to protect the communications.  These 
   unprotected flows are again vulnerable to a variety of attacks 
   including alteration or replay by a MiTM.  It is believed that the 
   use of 802.1AE will address this issue so deployers should consider 
   this if their threat model (especially with respect to wired 802.1X) 
   warrants ongoing protections. 

   Note that this process does not prevent the malware on laptop1 from 
   lying about its posture; this approach merely addresses the network 
   based MiTM attack.  Detection of local malware lying about its 
   posture is outside the scope of NEA but is being researched and 
   standardized in the Trusted Computing Group. 

4.3. Requirements for EAP Tunnel Methods 

   Because the PT-EAP inner method described in this specification 
   relies on the outer EAP tunnel method for a majority of its security 
   protections, this section reiterates the PT requirements that MUST be 
   met by the IETF standard EAP tunnel method for use with PT-EAP.   

   The security requirements described in this specification MUST be 
   implemented in any product claiming to be PT-EAP compliant.  The 
   decision of whether a particular deployment chooses to use these 
   protections is a deployment issue.  A customer may choose to avoid 
   potential deployment issues or performance penalties associated with 
   the use of cryptography when the required protection has been 
   achieved through other mechanisms (e.g. physical isolation).  If 
   security mechanisms may be deactivated by policy, an implementation 
   should offer an interface to query how a message will be (or was) 
   protected by PT so higher layer NEA protocols can factor this into 
   their decisions. 

   RFC 5209 includes the following requirement that is to be applied 
   during the selection of the EAP tunnel method(s) used in conjunction 
   with EAP-TNC: 

      PT-2 The PT protocol MUST be capable of supporting mutual 
      authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and replay 
      protection of the PB messages between the Posture Transport 
      Client and the Posture Transport Server.

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

   Note that mutual authentication could be achieved by a combination of 
   a strong authentication of one party (e.g. TLS server when EAP-TTLS 
   is used) by the EAP tunnel method in conjunction with a second 
   authentication of the other party (e.g. client authentication inside 
   the protected tunnel) by another EAP method running prior to EAP-TNC. 

   Having the Posture Transport Client always authenticate the Posture 
   Transport Server provides assurance to the NEA Client that the NEA 
   Server is authentic (not a rogue or MiTM) prior to disclosing secret 
   or potentially privacy sensitive information about what is running or 
   configured on the endpoint.  However the NEA Server's policy may 
   allow for the delay of the authentication of the NEA Client until a 
   suitable protected channel has been established allowing for non-
   cryptographic NEA Client credentials (e.g. username/password) to be 
   used.  Whether the communication channel is established with both or 
   one party performing a cryptographic authentication, the resulting 
   channel needs to provide strong integrity and confidentiality 
   protection to its contents.  These protections are to be bound to at 
   least the authentication of the NEA Client, so the session is 
   cryptographically bound to a particular authentication event. 

4.4. Candidate EAP Tunnel Method Protections 

   This section discusses how EAP-TNC is used within various EAP tunnel 
   methods meet the PT requirements from section 4.3.   

   EAP-FAST and EAP-TTLS make use of TLS [2] to protect the transport of 
   information between the NEA Client and NEA Server.  Each of these EAP 
   tunnel methods has two phases. In the first phase, a TLS tunnel is 
   established between NEA Client and NEA Server. In the second phase, 
   the tunnel is used to pass other information.  PT-EAP requires that 
   establishing this tunnel include at least an authentication of the 
   NEA Server by the NEA Client. 

   The phase two dialog may include authentication of the user by doing 
   other EAP methods or in the case of TTLS by using non-EAP 
   authentication dialogs.  EAP-TNC is also carried by the phase two 
   tunnel allowing the NEA assessment to be within an encrypted and 
   integrity protected transport. 

   With all these methods, a cryptographic key is derived from the 
   authentication that may be used to secure later transmissions.  Each 
   of these methods employs at least a NEA Server authentication using 
   an X.509 certificates.  Within each EAP tunnel method will exist a 
   set of inner EAP method (or an equivalent using TLVs if inner methods 
   aren't directly supported.)  These inner methods may perform 
   additional security handshakes including more granular

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

   authentications or exchanges of integrity information (such as EAP-
   TNC.)  At some point after the conclusion of each inner EAP method, 
   some of the methods will export the established secret keys to the 
   outer tunnel method.  It's expected that the outer method will 
   cryptographically mix these keys into any keys it is currently using 
   to protect the session and perform a final operation to determine 
   whether both parties have arrived at the same mixed key.  This 
   cryptographic binding of the inner method results to the outer 
   methods keys is essential for detection of nested method attacks, see 
   section 4.2.5.  

4.5. Security Claims for EAP-TNC as per RFC3748 

   This section summarizes the security claims as required by RFC3748 
   Section 7.2: 

      Auth. mechanism:              None 
      Ciphersuite negotiation:      No 
      Mutual authentication:        No 
      Integrity protection:         No 
      Replay protection:            No 
      Confidentiality:              No 
      Key derivation:               Yes 
      Key strength:                 Depends on D-H Group and Hash used 
      Dictionary attack resistant:  N/A 
      Fast reconnect:               No 
      Crypt. binding:               N/A 
      Session independence:         N/A 
      Fragmentation:                Yes 
      Channel binding:              No 
       
5. Privacy Considerations 

   The role of PT-EAP is to act as a secure transport for PB-TNC over a 
   network before the endpoint has been admitted to the network.  As a 
   transport protocol, PT-EAP does not directly utilize or require 
   direct knowledge of any personally identifiable information (PII).  
   PT-EAP will typically be used in conjunction with other EAP methods 
   that provide for the user authentication (if bi-directional 
   authentication is used), so the user's credentials are not directly 
   seen by the EAP-TNC inner method.  Therefore, the Posture Transport 
   Client and Posture Transport Server's implementation of EAP-TNC MUST 
   NOT observe the contents of the carried PB-TNC batches that could 
   contain PII carried by PA-TNC or PB-TNC. 

   While EAP-TNC does not provide cryptographic protection for the PB-
   TNC batches, it is designed to operate within an EAP tunnel method

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

   that provides strong authentication, integrity and confidentiality 
   services.  Therefore, it is important for deployers to leverage these 
   protections in order to prevent disclosure of PII potentially 
   contained within PA-TNC or PB-TNC within the EAP-TNC payload. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines an EAP method type named EAP-TNC with the 
   value 38. 

   [IANA Note: This value was previously reserved for another 
   purpose but has been used for EAP-TNC for some time and never 
   used for another purpose so please assign this value to EAP-
   TNC.] 

   This document also defines three new IANA registries: EAP-TNC 
   Versions, PT-EAP D-H PN Hash Algorithm IDs, and PT-EAP D-H PN 
   Group IDs.  This section explains how these registries work. 

   Because only eight (8) values are available in each of these 
   registries, a high bar is set for new assignments. The only way 
   to register new values in these registries is through Standards 
   Action (via an approved Standards Track RFC). 

6.1. Registry for EAP-TNC Versions 

   The name for this registry is "EAP-TNC Versions".  Each entry 
   in this registry should include a decimal integer value between 
   1 and 7 identifying the version, and a reference to the RFC 
   where the version is defined. 

   The following entries for this registry are defined in this 
   document.  Once this document becomes an RFC, they should 
   become the initial entries in the registry for EAP-TNC 
   Versions.  Additional entries to this registry are added by 
   Standards Action, as defined in RFC 5226 [8].

Appendix A.                 Evaluation Against NEA Requirements 

   This section evaluates the PT-EAP protocol against the PT 
   requirements defined in the NEA Overview and Requirements and 
   PB-TNC specifications.  Each subsection considers a separate 
   requirement and highlights how PT-EAP meets the requirement.  

A.1. Evaluation Against Requirement C-1 

   Requirement C-1 says: 

   C-1   NEA protocols MUST support multiple round trips between 
   the NEA Client and NEA Server in a single assessment. 

   PT-EAP meets this requirement.  Use of the EAP protocol along 
   with EAP-TNC and suitable EAP tunnel methods will allow for 
   multiple roundtrips. 

A.2. Evaluation Against Requirements C-2 

   Requirement C-2 says: 

   C-2   NEA protocols SHOULD provide a way for both the NEA 
   Client and the NEA Server to initiate a posture assessment or 
   reassessment as needed. 

   PT-EAP does NOT meet this requirement.  Generally EAP is used 
   by the endpoint during the joining of the network.  At that 
   time, the endpoint lacks an IP address so is unable to accept 
   inbound posture assessment requests from the NEA Server.  
   Subsequent reassessments of the endpoint after it has been 
   given access to a portion of the IP network can use the PT-TLS 
   protocol that supports the NEA Client and NEA Server to 
   initiate an assessment. 

A.3. Evaluation Against Requirements C-3 

   Requirement C-3 says: 

   C-3   NEA protocols including security capabilities MUST be 
   capable of protecting against active and passive attacks by 
   intermediaries and endpoints including prevention from replay 
   based attacks. 

   PT-EAP meets this requirement by leveraging the security 
   capabilities of the underlying EAP tunnel method.  EAP-TNC 
   itself does not provide protection against a variety of

Internet-Draft                  PT-EAP                     January 2010 
    

   potential attacks (beside the Diffie-Hellman Pre-Negotiation 
   support) so must rely on cryptographic support by the EAP 
   tunnel method. 

A.4. Evaluation Against Requirements C-4 

   Requirement C-4 says: 

   C-4   The PA and PB protocols MUST be capable of operating over 
   any PT protocol.  For example, the PB protocol must provide a 
   transport independent interface allowing the PA protocol to 
   operate without change across a variety of network protocol 
   environments (e.g. EAP/802.1X, PANA, TLS and IKE/IPsec). 

   Not applicable to PT, but the PT-EAP is independent of PA and 
   PB allowing those protocols to operate over other PT protocols. 

A.5. Evaluation Against Requirements C-5 

   Requirement C-5 says: 

   C-5   The selection process for NEA protocols MUST evaluate and 
   prefer the reuse of existing open standards that meet the 
   requirements before defining new ones.  The goal of NEA is not 
   to create additional alternative protocols where acceptable 
   solutions already exist. 

   Based on this requirement, PT-EAP should receive a strong 
   preference.  PT-EAP is equivalent with IF-T Binding to Tunneled 
   EAP Methods 1.1, an open TCG specification that has been widely 
   implemented. 

A.6. Evaluation Against Requirements C-6 

   Requirement C-6 says: 

   C-6   NEA protocols MUST be highly scalable; the protocols MUST 
   support many Posture Collectors on a large number of NEA 
   Clients to be assessed by numerous Posture Validators residing 
   on multiple NEA Servers. 

   PT-EAP meets this requirement.  The PT-EAP protocol is

A.7. Evaluation Against Requirements C-7 

   Requirement C-7 says: 

   C-7   The protocols MUST support efficient transport of a large 
   number of attribute messages between the NEA Client and the NEA 
   Server. 

   PT-EAP meets this requirement, subject to the limitations of 
   the underlying EAP protocol.  PT-EAP allows for the transport 
   of a very large number of attributes, up to 2^32 - 1 octets per 
   PB-TNC batch.  Furthermore, the PT-EAP protocol transports data 
   efficiently, only adding 10 octets of overhead per PT-EAP 
   message, which is small considering that a single PT-EAP 
   message may carry multiple PA-TNC attributes. 

   However, it is important to note that the EAP protocol that 
   underlies PT-EAP is not a good choice for transporting large 
   amounts of data.  EAP only supports one packet in flight at a 
   time, which severely limits throughput.  Further, some network 
   equipment imposes timeout restrictions on EAP exchanges.  
   Therefore, PT-EAP should not be used to transport large amounts 
   of attributes. 

A.8. Evaluation Against Requirements C-8 

   Requirement C-8 says: 

   C-8   NEA protocols MUST operate efficiently over low bandwidth 
   or high latency links. 

   PT-EAP protocols meet this requirement. PT-EAP was designed to 
   minimize the amount of overhead included in the protocol to 
   allow for efficient use over bandwidth or latency constrained 
   network links. 

A.9. Evaluation Against Requirements C-9 

   Requirement C-9 says: 

   C-9   For any strings intended for display to a user, the 
   protocols MUST support adapting these strings to the user's 
   language preferences. 

   PT-EAP meets this requirement.  PT-EAP does not include 
   messages intended for display to the user.

A.10. Evaluation Against Requirements C-10 

   Requirement C-10 says: 

   C-10  NEA protocols MUST support encoding of strings in UTF-8 
   format. 

   PA-EAP meets this requirement.  The PT-EAP protocol does not 
   include any strings in its fields but it allows higher-layer 
   protocols to encode their strings in UTF-8 format.  This allows 
   the protocol to support a wide range of languages efficiently. 

A.11. Evaluation Against Requirements C-11 

   Requirement C-11 says: 

   C-11  Due to the potentially different transport 
   characteristics provided by the underlying candidate PT 
   protocols, the NEA Client and NEA Server MUST be capable of 
   becoming aware of and adapting to the limitations of the 
   available PT protocol.  For example, some PT protocol 
   characteristics that might impact the operation of PA and PB 
   include restrictions on: which end can initiate a NEA 
   connection, maximum data size in a message or full assessment, 
   upper bound on number of roundtrips, and ordering (duplex) of 
   messages exchanged.  The selection process for the PT protocols 
   MUST consider the limitations the candidate PT protocol would 
   impose upon the PA and PB protocols. 

   PT-EAP meets this requirement.  The PT-EAP implementations may 
   be limited in number of roundtrips, assessment overall time, or 
   data transmission.  These constraints will be exposed up the 
   protocol stack so the Posture Broker Client and Posture Broker 
   Server can optimize and make most efficient use of the 
   available resources during the assessment. 

A.12. Evaluation Against Requirements PT-1 

   Requirement PT-1 says: 

   PT-1 The PT protocol MUST NOT interpret the contents of PB 
   messages being transported, i.e., the data it is carrying must 
   be opaque to it. 

   PT-EAP meets this requirement.  The PT-EAP encapsulates PB-TNC 
   batches without interpreting their contents.

A.13. Evaluation Against Requirements PT-2 

   Requirement PT-2 says: 

   PT-2 The PT protocol MUST be capable of supporting mutual 
   authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and replay 
   protection of the PB messages between the Posture Transport 
   Client and the Posture Transport Server. 

   PT-EAP meets this requirement.  The PT-EAP leverages an EAP 
   tunnel method to provide mutual authentication, integrity 
   protection and confidentiality as well as replay protection.  
   For more information see the Security Considerations section 4.   

A.14. Evaluation Against Requirements PT-3 

   Requirement PT-3 says: 

   PT-3 The PT protocol MUST provide reliable delivery for the PB 
   protocol.  This includes the ability to perform fragmentation 
   and reassembly, detect duplicates, and reorder to provide in-
   sequence delivery, as required. 

   EAP-TNC includes support for fragmentation and the underlying 
   EAP tunnel methods include support for duplicate detection and 
   reordering to provide in-sequence delivery. 

A.15. Evaluation Against Requirements PT-4 

   Requirement PT-4 says: 

   PT-4 The PT protocol SHOULD be able to run over existing 
   network access protocols such as 802.1X and IKEv2. 

   PT-EAP meets this requirement. The PT-EAP operates on top of 
   the 802.1X and IKEv2 protocols. 

A.16. Evaluation Against Requirements PT-5 

   Requirement PT-5 says: 

   PT-5 The PT protocol SHOULD be able to run between a NEA Client 
   and NEA Server over TCP or UDP (similar to Lightweight 
   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)). 

   PT-EAP does NOT meet this requirement.  PT-EAP is intended for 
   a different usage.  PT-EAP is intended to be used for pre-

   network admission before the endpoint has been given an IP 
   address and routes on the network.  This means that network 
   layer protocols such as IP are not yet able to communicate with 
   the system.  The PT-TLS (PT Binding to TLS) [11] meets this 
   requirement.   

A.17. Evaluation Against Requirements PT-6 (from PB-TNC specification) 

   Requirement PT-6 says: 

   PT-6 The PT protocol MUST be connection oriented; it MUST 
   support confirmed initiation and close down.  

   PT-EAP meets this requirement.  The PT-EAP fits into the EAP 
   framework which provides for orderly initiation and shutdown. 

A.18. Evaluation Against Requirements PT-7 (from PB-TNC specification) 

   Requirement PT-7 says: 

   PT-7 The PT protocol MUST be able to carry binary data.  

   PT-EAP meets this requirement.  The PT-EAP is capable of 
   carrying binary data. 

A.19. Evaluation Against Requirements PT-8 (from PB-TNC specification) 

   Requirement PT-8 says: 

   PT-8 The PT protocol MUST provide mechanisms for flow control 
   and congestion control.  

   PT-EAP meets this requirement.  The PT-EAP utilizes EAP's half 
   duplex, round robin message exchange to provide flow and 
   congestion control. 

A.20. Evaluation Against Requirements PT-9 (from PB-TNC specification) 

   Requirement PT-9 says: 

   PT-9 PT protocol specifications MUST describe the capabilities 
   that they provide for and limitations that they impose on the 
   PB protocol (e.g. half/full duplex, maximum message size).   

   PT-EAP specification meets this requirement.  This 
   specification discusses the level of transport service provided 
   to the Posture Broker Client and Posture Broker Server.

   Generally, the PT-EAP method supports the pre-network admission 
   usages discussed in RFC 5209.  The maximum message size for PT-
   EAP is 2^16-10 octets.  EAP by its very nature is half duplex 
   and very simple which allows it to be used in a wide variety of 
   settings including over link layer protocols during the 
   entrance to the network.

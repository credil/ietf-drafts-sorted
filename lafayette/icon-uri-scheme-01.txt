                         The 'icon' URI scheme
                   draft-lafayette-icon-uri-scheme-01

Abstract

   This document specifies the "icon" URI scheme.  Icons have a
   fundamental role in user interaction with computer operating systems.
   In a graphical user interface, they may represent a file, folder,
   application, or device.  They live on the desktop, in toolbars, and
   in menus.  Most operating systems provide a standard set of icons
   that match the look and feel of the system.  The "icon" URI scheme
   lets web page designers leverage these existing platform icons.

Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)

   Discussion of this draft should take place on the URI Review mailing
   list (uri-review@ietf.org).

URI Scheme versus URN Namespace

   It has been suggested that a URN namespace may be more appropriate
   for icon resolution than the new URI scheme.  Discussion [1] on these
   matters has been ongoing in the uri-review@ietf.org mailing list.
   The arguments will be taken into consideration for the final decision
   as whether this draft should be considered for permanent
   registration.

1.  Introduction

   An "icon" URI is designed to be a web accessible scheme used to
   resolve operating system icon resources.  "Icon" URIs use either a
   file extension or an Internet media type to specify the filetype of a
   platform icon.  Web pages can use "icon" URIs in any place that an
   image is specifiable by a URI.  In particular, "icon" URIs can be
   used with "<img>" tags and JavaScript "Image" objects.

   Similar icon URI schemes are currently being used in some modern
   browsers.  The Mozilla project has a "moz-icon://" URI scheme that is
   web accessible and provides native and browser themed icons.  The
   Chromium project has a "chrome://fileicon" scheme that is not web
   accessible, but does provide native icons for internal pages.  This
   new scheme is an attempt to standardize icon URIs so that their core
   functionality may become available to all web pages.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  URI Syntax

   The general syntax of an "icon" URI is defined below using ABNF
   [RFC5234]:

   iconuri = "icon:" ( fextension / mediatype / "unknown" /
                       "directory" / "parentdir" ) [ ";" size ]
   fextension = "." 1*token ; File extension
   mediatype = [ type ":" subtype ] ; Internet media type
   size = pixels / "small" / "medium" / "large"
   pixels = 1*digit ; Size of icon in square pixels

   where "token", "digit", "type" and "subtype" rules are defined in
   [RFC2045].  The sections of an "icon" URI are ALWAYS case-
   insensitive.

4.  Encoding Considerations

   The encoding of the "type" and "subtype" rules is defined in
   [RFC2045].  The "fextension" rule may include characters from the
   Unicode Character Set [UCS], as suggested by URI [RFC3986], by first
   encoding those characters as octets to the UTF-8 character encoding
   [RFC3629].  Only those octets that do not correspond to characters in
   the unreserved set should be percent-encoded.

   By using UTF-8 encoding, there are no known compatibility issues with
   mapping Internationalized Resource Identifiers to "icon" URIs
   according to [RFC3987].  Since "icon" URIs do not use domain names,
   "ireg-name" conversion is unnecessary.

5.  Resolving "icon" URIs

   An "icon" URI MUST resolve to an image resource representing an icon.
   The "directory" and "parentdir" keywords SHOULD resolve to the system
   icons for a directory and a parent directory (i.e. the "up" icon).
   The resolved icon SHOULD be the platform icon for a the specified
   "fextension" or "mediatype".  If an icon is not available for the
   specified filetype, applications MUST return a default icon which
   SHOULD be the system icon for files of unknown type.  The icon
   resource's dimensions MUST match the size indicated in the URI or use
   the default size.

5.1.  File extension

   The filetype for an icon is specifiable by the "fextension" rule.  An
   acceptable value for this section is a file extension for which a
   platform icon can be retrieved.  Applications are REQUIRED to support
   "icon" URI resolution by file extension.

Internet-Draft            The 'icon' URI scheme                June 2010


   In the event that a platform icon is not available for the provided
   file extension, the application SHOULD return a default "unknown
   file" icon in the appropriate size.

5.2.  Internet media type

   The filetype for an icon is also specifiable by the "mediatype" rule.
   An acceptable value for this section is an Internet media type, as
   defined in [RFC2045] and [RFC2046], for which a platform icon can be
   retrieved.  Applications are REQUIRED to support "icon" URI
   resolution by Internet media type.

   In the event that a platform icon is not available for the provided
   media type, the application SHOULD return a default "unknown file"
   icon in the appropriate size.

5.3.  Icon Size

   An "icon" URI MAY specify the size of a requested icon through the
   "size" rule.  The "size" MUST be either an integer value representing
   the width/height of the square icon in pixels or one of: "small",
   "medium", or "large".  Applications are REQUIRED to support both
   user-provided integer values and the 3 keyword values.

   If the "size" is specified as "small" the application MUST return a
   16x16 pixels icon.

   If the "size" is specified as "medium" the application MUST return a
   64x64 pixels icon.

   If the "size" is specified as "large" the application MUST return a
   256x256 pixels icon.

   If the "size" is not specified in the URI, the application MUST
   return a 16x16 pixels icon.

   In the event that the platform does not support one of the keyword
   icon sizes or a user-provided size, the application SHOULD scale the
   icon appropriately.

5.4.  Examples

   icon: -- Displays a 16x16 pixels platform icon for an unknown
   filetype.

   icon:;medium -- Displays a 64x64 pixels platform icon for an unknown
   filetype.

   icon:.zip --Displays a 16x16 pixels platform icon for the .zip file
   extension.

   icon:.MP3;32 --Displays a 32x32 pixels platform icon for the .mp3
   file extension.

   ICON:unknown --Displays a 16x16 pixels default icon for an unknown
   filetype.

   icon:directory --Displays a 16x16 pixels platform icon for a
   directory.

   icon:parentdir;32 --Displays a 32x32 pixels platform icon for a
   parent directory.

   icon:image:jpeg;128 --Displays a 128x128 pixels platform icon for the
   image/jpeg media type.

   icon:AUDIO:MPEG;large --Displays a 256x256 platform icon for the
   audio/mpeg media type.

   icon:.doc;SMALL --Displays a 16x16 platform icon for the .doc file
   extension.

   icon:.pdf;medium --Displays a 64x64 platform icon for the .pdf file
   extension.

6.  Normalization

   "Icon" URIs adhere to the standard URI normalization rules [RFC3986];
   specifically Simple String Comparison, Case Normalization, and
   Percent-Encoding Normalization.  Due to the structure of "icon" URIs,
   the Syntax-Based, Scheme-Based, and Protocol-Based Normalization
   rules do not apply.  The sections of an "icon" URI are ALWAYS case-
   insensitive.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are potential privacy risks that need to be taken into
   consideration with this new scheme.

   "Icon" URIs specify private icon resources located on a user's
   machine.  Web pages MUST NOT be able to retrieve the platform icons
   that this scheme provides to the user.  Further, web pages MUST NOT
   be able to retrieve information about the platform icons that might
   expose the applications installed on a user's machine.  The following
   sections explore specific issues that applications MUST address in
   their respective implementations.

7.1.  Canvas Images

   HTML5 introduces the canvas element which allows for dynamic
   scriptable rendering of 2D bitmap images.

   Images can be imported onto the canvas by first retrieving a
   reference to a JavaScript "Image" object, then drawing the image on
   the canvas using the drawImage.  Another option involves setting the
   2D context's "fillStyle" or "strokeStyle" to a "CanvasPattern" object
   created from an "Image" object using the createPattern method.  There
   are four ways one can retrieve a handle to an "Image" object:

   1.  Retrieve "<img>" elements already on the page using the DOM.

   2.  Retrieve other canvas elements using the document.getElementsById
   method or the document.getElementsByTagName method.

   3.  Create an image from scratch, i.e. var img = new Image().

   4.  Embed an image using its data URI.

   As a result of #1, an "<img>" tag, whose src attribute is an "icon"
   URI, can be retrieved as a JavaScript "Image" object.  Considering
   #3; an "Image" can be created in JavaScript and have its src field is
   set to an "icon" URI.

   Drawing the "Image" to the canvas provides web pages with two
   potential means of accessing the images: the getImageData and
   toDataURL methods of the canvas's 2D context.  The canvas's 2D
   drawing API is defined in [Canvas2D].

   An "Image" object with an "icon" URI as its src attribute MUST NOT be
   considered as same-origin as any other origin.  If an "Image" with an
   "icon" URI src is drawn to a canvas, the canvas MUST be considered
   tainted and have its "origin-clean" flag set to false.  As such, if
   "getImageData" or "toDataURL" is called on a canvas that has been
   tainted by "icon" URI "Image" data, the method MUST raise a
   SECURITY_ERR exception.  See Security with canvas elements in the
   HTML5 Draft Standard [HTML5] for further details.

7.2.  Image Size

   Because the width and height of an "Image" object are always
   accessible, applications MUST use the default size (16x16) for
   platform icons if the size has not been provided by the "icon" URI.
   This is a requirement because evil web pages may be able to use the
   width and height of icons to infer details about the applications a
   user has installed.

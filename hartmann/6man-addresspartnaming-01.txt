Internet Draft          Naming IPv6 address parts            May 6, 2011


Abstract

   In the daily communication between technicians, engineers and other
   people who need to deal with computer networks, it is often necessary
   to refer to particular parts of IP addresses. In the world of IPv4,
   the term "octet" is well established, however as the use of IPv6 is
   spreading, it becomes apparent that there is no such commonly
   accepted term for IPv6 addresses.

   Discussing and explaining technical matters become difficult when
   different people use different terms for the same thing. Therefore,
   this document discusses several naming proposal for those 16bit
   pieces of IPv6 addreses.

1. Introduction

   Verbal and written communication requires a common set of terms, eas-
   ily understood by every potential party. While deploying IPv6, when
   refering to segments of IPv6 addresses, confusion regularly arises
   due to the usage of different and sometimes conflicting nomenclature
   for the same pieces of information.

   [IPV6Addr] is the normative reference to IPv6 addressing and avoids
   to coin a special term for the subject of this document itself:
      The preferred form is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, where the 'x's are one to
      four hexadecimal digits of the eight 16-bit pieces of the address.

   [IPv6Rep] is the normative reference to IPv6 address text representa-
   tion and introduces the term "16-bit field" or short "field".

2. Rationale

   While we readily agree that the naming of IPv6 address parts is not
   the most pressing concern the Internet is facing today, a common
   nomenclature is important for efficient communication.

   In IPv6 deployments the delimiting colons are regularly used to
   facilitate the separation of labels discerning not only administra-
   tive boundaries but also network segments and distinct infrastructure
   components. Consequently the values between the colons are frequently
   refered to especially in communication regarding coordinative mat-
   ters.

   Time spent explaining what one is referring to is wasted and con-
   flicting names can lead to misunderstanding while the usage of a com-
   mon term helps facilitating quick understanding.

   To solve this problem, the specification of a precise and recogniz-
   able term is advised.

   A typical ambiguity occurs in [IPv6Rep] which uses the term "field"
   or "16-bit field" for the term in question. This case is interesting
   because there was a short IETF WG discussion which term should be
   used.
      If an IPv6 address field in a certificate was incorrectly verified
      by converting it to text ...

   Since parts of the internet community only accept authoritative
   advice substantiated by a published document, also known as the
   'citation needed' approach, it is helpful to have a definite source.

3. Naming Considerations

   Any term that can be confused with other technical terms due to pho-
   netic similarities can lead to misconfiguration causing reachability
   and security risks to the involved and third parties. Even with Eng-
   lish being the preferred language in the IT world today, a good name
   should describe the technical matter precisely while being easy to
   remember, spell and pronounce in as many languages as possible.

4. hextet

   "hexadectet" is directly derived from IPv4's "octet", thus techni-
   cally correct and convenient to get used to. Because it is harder to
   pronounce, the short form "hextet" is used.

   A hextet refers to a 16 bit entity, aligned by colons.

   "hextet" MUST be used in all technical documents and specifications
   refering to IPv6 address parts. It SHOULD be used in all informal
   communication, written or otherwise

5. Security Considerations

   This memo does not directly discuss security issues, however the lack
   of a common, well established term could lead to misinterpretation,
   possibly resulting in insecure configurations and other problems.

6. IANA Considerations

   No assignments by the IANA are required. However it will be required
   that the IANA adopts the term in future documents.

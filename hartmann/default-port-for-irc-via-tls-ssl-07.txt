Internet Draft      Default Port for IRC via TLS/SSL      April 23, 2011


1. Rationale

   Although system port assignments for both plain text (TCP/UDP port
   194) and TLS/SSL [RFC5246] encrypted (TCP/UDP port 994) IRC traffic
   exist [IANALIST], it is common practice amongst IRC networks not to
   use them for reasons of convenience and general availability on sys-
   tems where no root access is granted or desired.

   IRC networks have defaulted to listening on TCP port 6667 for plain
   text connections for considerable time, now.  This is covered by the
   IRCU assignment of TCP/UDP ports 6665-6669.

   Similar consensus has been reached within the IRC community about
   listening on TCP port 6697 for incoming IRC connections encrypted via
   TLS/SSL.

2. Technical Details

2.1. Connection Establishment

   An IRC client connects to an IRC server.  Immediately after that, a
   normal TLS/SSL handshake takes place.  Once the TLS/SSL connection
   has been established, a normal IRC connection is established via the
   tunnel.  Optionally, the IRC server may set a specific umode for the
   client, marking it as using TLS/SSL.  Again optionally, an IRC server
   might offer the option to create channels in such a way that only
   clients connected via TLS/SSL may join.

   For details on how IRC works, see [RFC1459], [RFC2810], [RFC2811],
   [RFC2812], [RFC2813].  Please note that IRC is extremely fragmented
   and implementation details can vary wildly. Most implementations
   regard the latter RFCs as suggestions, not as binding.

2.2. Why Not STARTTLS

   Due to the highly asynchronous nature of IRC, everything other than
   suspending the whole connection, running STARTTLS and resuming the
   connection wouldn't work.  As there is no concept of suspended con-
   nections in IRC, this would require significant effort on the server
   side and effort on the client side, as well.

   The general consensus is that STARTTLS is not worth the effort and
   that no one is willing to implement it.

   While newer protocols can easily design for STARTTLS from the start,
   IRC is a legacy protocol; implementing STARTTLS in IRC is not realis-
   tic.

2.3. Certiticate Details

2.3.1. Server Certificate

   The IRC server's certificate should be issued by a commonly trusted
   CA.

   The Common Name should match the FQDN of the IRC server or have
   appropriate wildcards, if applicable.

   The IRC client should verify the certificate.

2.3.2. Client Certificate

   If the client is using a certificate as well, it should be issued by
   a commonly trusted CA or a CA designated by the IRC network.

   The certificate's Common Name should match the main IRC nickname.

   If the network offers nick registration, this nick should be used.

   If the network offers grouped nicks, the main nick or account name
   should be used.

   If the network offers nick registration, the client certificate
   should be used to identify the user against the nick database. See
   [CERTFP] for a possible implementation.

3. Security Considerations

   The lack of a common, well established listening port for IRC via
   TLS/SSL could lead to end users being unaware of their IRC network of
   choice supporting TLS/SSL.  Thus, they might not use encryption even
   if they wanted to.

   It should be noted that this document merely describes client-to-
   server encryption.  There are still other attack vectors like mali-
   cious administrators, compromised servers, insecure server-to-server
   communication, channels that do not enforce encryption for all chan-
   nel members, malicious clients or comprised client machines on which
   logs are stored.

   Those attacks can by their very nature not be addressed by client-to-
   server encryption.  Additional safe-guards are needed if a user fears
   any of the threats above.

   This document does not address server links as there are no commonly
   accepted ports or even back-end protocols.  Ports and back-end

   protocols are normally established in a bilateral agreement.  All
   operators are encouraged to use strong encryption for back-end traf-
   fic, no matter if they offer IRC via TLS/SSL to end users.

4. IANA Considerations

   An assignment of TCP port 6697 for IRC via TLS/SSL will be requested.
   The proposed keyword is "ircs-u" and the description "Internet Relay
   Chat via TLS/SSL":

   ircs-u  6697/tcp       Internet Relay Chat via TLS/SSL

   Additionally, a clean-up of the current naming scheme will be
   requested.  The author is trying to get into contact with the respec-
   tive assignees.

   ircs    994/tcp        Internet Relay Chat via TLS/SSL
   ircs    994/udp        Internet Relay Chat via TLS/SSL

   irc-u1  6665/tcp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u2  6666/tcp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u3  6667/tcp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u4  6668/tcp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u5  6669/tcp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u1  6665/udp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u2  6666/udp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u3  6667/udp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u4  6668/udp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u5  6669/udp       Internet Relay Chat

6. Acknowledgements

   Thanks go to the IRC community at large for reaching a consensus.

   Special thanks go to the IRC operators who were eager to support port
   6697 on their respective networks.

   Special thanks also go to Nevil Brownlee and James Schaad for working
   on this document in their capacities as RFC Editor and Reviewer,
   respectively.

APPENDIX A: Supporting data

   As of October 2010, out of the top twenty IRC networks
   [TOP100],[MAVERICK], ten support TLS/SSL.  Only one of those networks
   does not support TLS/SSL via port 6697 and has no plans to support
   it.  All others supported it already or are supporting it since being
   contacted by the author.  A more detailed analysis is available but
   does not fit within the scope of this document.

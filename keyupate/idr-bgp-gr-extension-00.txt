                  Graceful Restart Extensions for BGP
               draft-keyupate-idr-bgp-gr-extension-00.txt

Abstract

   The current BGP Graceful Restart mechanism limits the usage of BGP
   Graceful Restart to BGP protocol messages other than a BGP
   NOTIFICATION message.  This document defines an extension to the BGP
   Graceful Restart that permits the Graceful Restart procedures to be
   performed when the BGP speaker receives a BGP NOTIFICATION Message.
   This document also defines a new BGP NOTIFICATION Cease Error subcode
   to prevent BGP speakers supporting the extension defined in this
   document from performing a Graceful Restart.

Internet-Draft     Graceful Restart Extensions for BGP     February 2011


1.  Introduction

   For many classes of errors, the BGP protocol must send a NOTIFICATION
   message and reset the peering session to handle the error condition.
   The BGP Graceful Restart extension defined in [RFC4724] requires that
   normal BGP procedures defined in [RFC4271] be followed when a
   NOTIFICATION message is sent or received.  This document defines an
   extension to BGP Graceful Restart that permits the Graceful Restart
   procedures to be performed when the BGP speaker receives a
   NOTIFICATION message.  This permits the BGP speaker to avoid flapping
   reachability and continue forwarding while the BGP speaker restarts
   the session to handle errors detected in the BGP protocol.

   This document defines a BGP NOTIFICATION cease Error subcode for the
   Cease Error code to prevent BGP speakers supporting the extension
   defined in this document from performing a Graceful Restart.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Modifications to BGP Graceful Restart Capability

   The BGP Graceful Restart Capability is augmented to signal the
   Graceful Restart support for BGP NOTIFICATION messages.  In
   particular, the flags field for Address Family is augmented as
   follows:

            +--------------------------------------------------+
            | Restart Flags (4 bits)                           |
            +--------------------------------------------------+
            | Restart Time in seconds (12 bits)                |
            +--------------------------------------------------+
            | Address Family Identifier (16 bits)              |
            +--------------------------------------------------+
            | Subsequent Address Family Identifier (8 bits)    |
            +--------------------------------------------------+
            | Flags for Address Family (8 bits)                |
            +--------------------------------------------------+
            | ...                                              |
            +--------------------------------------------------+
            | Address Family Identifier (16 bits)              |
            +--------------------------------------------------+
            | Subsequent Address Family Identifier (8 bits)    |
            +--------------------------------------------------+
            | Flags for Address Family (8 bits)                |
            +--------------------------------------------------+



    Flags for Address Family:

            This field contains bit flags relating to routes that were
            advertised with the given AFI and SAFI.


                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
               |F|N| Reserved  |
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The second most significant bit "N" is defined as a BGP Graceful
   Notification bit, which is used to indicate the Graceful Restart
   support for BGP NOTIFICATION messages.  BGP speaker indicates the
   Graceful Restart support for BGP NOTIFICATION messages and its
   ability to handle the new BGP NOTIFICATION Cease message subcode and
   the format for a BGP NOTIFICATION Cease message defined in [RFC4486]
   when the Graceful NOTIFICATION bit is set (value 1).


3.  BGP Hard Reset Subcode

   A new BGP Cease message subcode is defined known as BGP Hard Reset
   Subcode.  The value of this subcode is 9.

   Whenever a BGP speaker receives a NOTIFICATION message with the Cease

Internet-Draft     Graceful Restart Extensions for BGP     February 2011


   Error code and Hard Reset Error subcode, the speaker MUST terminate
   the BGP session following the standard procedures in [RFC4271].


4.  Operation

   A BGP speaker that is willing to receive and send BGP NOTIFICATION
   messages in Graceful mode should advertise the BGP Graceful
   Notification Flag "N" using the Graceful Restart Capability as
   defined in [RFC4724].

   When a BGP Speaker receives a BGP NOTIFICATION message, it SHOULD
   follow the standard rules of the receiving speaker mentioned in
   [RFC4724] for all AFI/SAFIs for which it has announced the BGP
   Graceful Notification flag.  The BGP speaker generating a BGP
   NOTIFICATION message SHOULD follow the standard rules of the
   receiving Speaker in [RFC4724] for all AFI/SAFIs that were announced
   with the BGP Graceful Notification flag.

   Once the session is re-established, both BGP speakers MUST set their
   "Forwarding State" bit to 1 if they want to apply planned graceful
   restart.  The handling of the "Forwarding State" bit should be done
   as specified by the procedures of the Receiving speaker in [RFC4724]
   are applied.

   As part of this extension, possible consecutive restarts SHOULD NOT
   delete a route (from the peer) previously marked as stale, until
   required by rules mentioned in [RFC4724].


5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Robert Raszuk for the review and
   comments.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP Cease message subcode known as BGP
   Hard Reset Subcode.  IANA mantains the list of existing BGP Cease
   message subcodes.  This document proposes defining a new BGP Cease
   message subcode known as BGP Hard Reset Subcode with the value 9.


7.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing [RFC4724] and [RFC4271]

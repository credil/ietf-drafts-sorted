Abstract 

   This document addresses the subject of FEC-based protection of 
   multimedia streams. It is proposed to apply re-packetization on the 
   application source stream data units in order to get a constant data 
   unit size within each block. A reverse packetization operation should 
   also be applied in the receiver in order to provide the application 
   consumer with original application data units. By avoiding any 
   padding in the process of repair packet production, this proposal 
   brings a significant performance enhancement which is evaluated by 
   simulation. The proposed re-packetization operations can be used 
   without requiring change to the FEC framework.

1. Introduction 

   The FEC Framework document [1] describes a framework for using FEC 
   codes, in order to provide to applications protection against packet 
   losses. The target applications of this framework also include 
   multimedia applications with real-time constraints. 

   The application data units which are provided to the FEC framework 
   are sent to the receivers through UDP packets called source packets. 
   They are either sent unmodified (e.g. in case of RTP payload), or 
   sent after appending of a "source FEC payload ID" in the UDP payload. 

   In addition to such source packets, repair packets built from source 
   packets can be sent to the receivers as well. Real time applications 
   involve data units of variable size. Therefore, the process of 
   building repair packets typically involves padding to accommodate 
   different lengths of the data units. 

   However, it is possible to re-packetize data units in the sender 
   before submitting them to the FEC framework, by concatenating all

   data units for one FEC block, and then building a new set of data 
   units of equal size. 

   A protocol header must be appended in the new data units in order to 
   let receivers perform a roll back of this operation at the other end, 
   and to provide the application consumer with original data units. 

   Section 2 in this document details the possible combination of the 
   FEC framework together with re-packetization. 

   The proposed re-packetization provides significant performance 
   improvements which are evaluated in the appendix by means of 
   simulation. 

   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's 
   mailing list at fecframe@ietf.org and/or the authors. 

2. Combining re-packetization with the FEC framework 

   Repair packets are built in the sender once a block of application 
   data units is received from the application. 

   If re-packetization has not been applied, data units in this block 
   are cut into smaller symbols of equal size. Symbols that were at the 
   end of the packet are typically padded in order to reach the pre-
   assigned size for a symbol. 

   The FEC encoder builds then a set of repair symbols out of the set of 
   source symbols. Finally repair symbols are grouped into repair 
   packets and sent to the receivers.  

   Padding presents the disadvantage of increasing the bit-rate of the 
   repair flow. Different strategies can be used for alleviating the 
   negative effect. We may first consider different extreme strategies: 

   (a) Have small repair symbols and put only one repair symbol per 
   repair packet. 

   (b) Set symbol size equal to the largest application data unit, and 
   put only one repair symbol per repair packet. 

   (c) Have small repair symbols but put many repair symbols per repair 
   packet. 

   Each extreme strategy has its pitfall:

Internet-Draft      Benefits of re-packetization         February 2010 
 
 
   (a) will generate high bit-rates with IP+UDP headers attached to each 
   packet. The FEC bandwidth resource will get very large without having 
   benefits in terms of FEC efficiency. 

   (b) will generate a lot of padding in order to align all repair 
   packets to the size of the largest application data unit. Again FEC 
   bandwidth resource will get very large without efficiency benefits. 

   (c) will have poor performances because the loss of a single repair 
   packet will translate into a large number of repair symbol being 
   lost. 

   In practice, the best strategy is somewhere between the extreme ones. 
   But the optimum compromise is still behind what can be achieved if 
   re-packetization is applied. In this latter case, it is assumed that 
   the FEC encoder maps one equalized data unit to one and only one 
   symbol. 

   The appendix attached to this document provides simulation results 
   showing that re-packetization can bring significant performance 
   enhancement. 

   Figure 1 illustrates the architecture combining both re-packetization 
   and the FEC framework.

       Figure 1: Combining re-packetization with the FEC framework. 

    

   The re-packetization module is supposed to receive application data 
   units for one block, and then to build a new set of data units of 
   equal sizes.

   Typically, a block of application data units is made of all data 
   units produced by the application during a specific period of time. 
   Therefore the number of data units per block is typically variable. 
   In case of re-packetization, the number of equalized data units can 
   be set equal to the number of original application data units 
   received for this block.  

   A specific header should be added to the equalized data units in 
   order to allow restoral in the receiver. 

   This header is defined as follows (see figure 2). 

                   +-------------------------------+ 
      First byte:  |Block index                    |    
                   +-------------------------------+ 
      Second byte: |Data unit index                | 
                   +-------------------------------+ 
      Third byte:  | Size of original application  |         
                   + data unit that corresponds to +                   
      Fourth byte: | the above data unit index     | 
                   +-------------------------------+       

       Figure 2: proposed header for re-packetization purpose. 

    

   It assumes that we have no more than 256 data units per block and 
   that the number of equalized data units is equal to (or possibly 
   larger than) the number of original data units. 

   Note that even though the purpose of the re-packetization is to 
   provide data units of equal size, we may still have a 1-byte 
   difference in the set of equalized packets, because the overall 
   number of bytes for one block may not be a multiple of the number of 
   equalized data units to be produced. Then packets with an index lower 
   or equal to the remainder may have one more byte than the other 
   packets. 

   It has to be noted that the proposed re-packetization and restoral 
   operations have the following drawback. If the FEC decoder is not 
   able to recover one packet in the block, then all subsequent packets 
   in the block will probably get lost at the application consumer 
   because original data units cannot be restored. This negative effect 
   is taken into account in the simulations presented in the appendix. 
   Despite this negative effect, the performance advantage of re-
   packetization is still significant.

3. Security Considerations 

   There are no new security issues introduced by the techniques 
   considered in this document. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   There are no requirements for IANA in this document. 

5. Conclusions 

   This document and the attached appendix show that it is beneficial to 
   equalize the size of application data units which are provided to the 
   FEC framework in the sender for a given block. This operation 
   involves an additional header to be appended to the equalized data 
   units in order to let receivers restore original data units before 
   forwarding them to the consuming application.

Appendix A.                 Simulation results. 

   The purpose of this appendix is to evaluate the benefits of re-
   packetization in terms of performance. 

   It involves two approaches, namely: 

   - approach 1, with the FEC framework being used without re-
      packetization, and 

   - approach 2, with FEC framework and repacketization being used 
      jointly. 

   For this purpose, we are going to make common assumptions, and we are 
   going to provide simulation results comparing both approaches under 
   such common assumptions. 

    

   Assumption 1: source stream. 
   ------------- 

   Use the same real media stream for both approaches. 

   A "real" RTP video stream containing H264 AVC encoded RTP packets, 
   has been recorded for simulation purpose. 

   The average bit-rate of this RTP stream, that does not include the 
   headers of protocols below RTP, is equal to 119.9 kbit/s. 

   Packet sizes (with respect to UDP payload and including RTP header) 
   and packet arrival times were recorded and made available for the 
   simulator. Though the video session had limited duration (around 1 
   minute) simulated durations could be made arbitrarily long by 
   repeating the same video stream as many times as needed. 

    

   Assumption 2: block periodicity. 
   -------------  

   Block periodicity is set equal to 500 ms. 

   It is not mandatory to have a fixed block periodicity. Other criteria 
   can be used for building blocks.

   However we would like to limit the latency increase brought by the 
   FEC. Fixing a block periodicity equal to 500 ms allows to set a limit 
   to the latency increase. 

   According to this assumption, a block of source packets is made of 
   all RTP packets produced by the sending application during a given 
   500 ms interval. 

    

   Assumption 3: bit-rates. 
   -------------  

   The average bit-rates encompassing both source packets and repair 
   packets must be equal for both approaches.  

   Average bit-rates are considered at IP level and include all 
   overheads brought by IP, UDP, RTP, equalization header (approach 2), 
   repair FEC payload ID (approach 1).  

   No header compression algorithm is considered. 

   Furthermore, because the application data units consist of RTP 
   packets, source packets are sent unmodified in case of approach 1, 
   without the addition of a "source FEC payload ID". 

   The following table provides average bitrates at IP level. 

   +-----------------------------------------------------------+ 
   |                            Approach 1        Approach 2   | 
   |                                                           | 
   |Source bit-rate (kbit/s)    125.63            126.54       | 
   |Total bit-rate  (kbit/s)    253.09 (target)   253.09       | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+ 

   Because of the additional overhead for re-packetization purpose, the 
   source bit-rate is slightly greater with approach 2 as compared to 
   approach 1. 

   In case of approach 2, the FEC bit-rate is designed in this 
   simulation to be equal to the source bit-rate, so that the total bit-
   rate provided in the above table is equal to twice the source bit-
   rate. 

   The same total bit-rate is set as a design target in the case of 
   approach 1.

   Assumption 4: FEC design. 
   -------------  

   Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes are used. With such codes, if 
   we have k source symbols and n-k repair symbols, it is sufficient to 
   receive k symbols of whichever kind, in order to restore the original 
   k source symbols. 

   The simulation treats the set of source RTP packets received in a 500 
   ms interval as a FEC block. Let us call N the number of such packets 
   for a given FEC block. Then for this block we have the following 
   number of source symbols and repair symbols: 

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+ 
   |                            Approach 1            Approach 2   | 
   |                                                               | 
   |Number of source packets    N                     N            | 
   |Number of source symbols    Nss                   N            | 
   |Number of repair symbols    Floor(alpha*Nss)      N            | 
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+ 

   The case of approach 2 is the simplest: each equalized source packet 
   is treated as a source symbol, and for each source symbol, there is a 
   repair symbol of the same size. 

   For approach 1, we have first to assume a given symbol size and a 
   given number of repair symbols per repair packet. Then we have to run 
   the usual process in order to build source symbols out of source 
   packets, where each source packet is first prepended with a 2-byte 
   indication of the source packet size, then cut into several symbols 
   of same size, with the last being padded in order to reach this size. 
   A repair packet is built from the given number of repair symbols per 
   repair packet and includes IP and UDP protocol overheads. It also 
   includes a repair FEC payload ID including information needed for the 
   FEC decoding process and counting 6 bytes. 

   The number of source symbols in the block is called Nss. Then the 
   number of repair symbols is set equal to the integer part of Nss 
   multiplied by a fixed value called 'alpha'. For each possible 
   configuration, a simulation has been done in order to find the value 
   of 'alpha' that satisfies the assumption 3 about bit-rates. 

   We obtain the values reported in figure 3:

   Assumption 5: Packet losses. 
   ------------- 

   Packet loss occurs randomly according to a given average Packet Loss 
   Ratio (PLR).  

   The same PLR applies both on source packets and on repair packets. 

   Simulations are carried out with 2 different PLR values: 0.1 and 0.2. 

   The simulation outcome is made of the residual PLR. 

   It should be noted that in case of approach 2, the original packet 
   restore operation in the receiver has an amplifying behavior on 
   residual packet losses, in the sense that when a packet can't be 
   restored in the middle of a block, all remaining packets in the block 
   are going to get lost too, because the original source packet 
   restoration is corrupted for all remaining packets, even though those 
   packets may have been received correctly or may have been correctly 
   reconstructed by the FEC decoder. 

    

   Results 
   ------- 

   For approach 1 and channel PLR=0.1, we obtain the following residual

   Figure 4: Residual PLR for approach 1 with channel PLR=0.1. 

   For the same PLR equal to 0.1 but with approach 2, we obtain a 
   residual PLR equal to 5.32x10-8, to be compared with the best PLR in 
   figure 4 (4.88x10-7). 

   For approach 1 and channel PLR=0.2, we obtain the following residual 
   PLRs.

Abstract

   ETR Address Forwarding (EAF) is a novel method by which an IPv4 Core-
   Edge Separation solution to the Internet's routing scaling problem
   can tunnel packets from an ITR to an ETR.  EAF involves using 31 bits
   of the IPv4 header for new purposes: bit 48, the More Fragments flag,
   the Fragment Offset field and the Header Checksum field - to carry a
   30 bit ETR address.  Consequently, packets in this format need to be
   handled by routers with upgraded functionality.  EAF is an
   alternative to encapsulation and has advantages including: simpler
   ITRs and ETRs, direct support for conventional RFC 1191 PMTUD, no
   encapsulation overhead and full compatibility with IPsec AH and
   Traceroute.  This I-D also briefly explores an alternative to this
   approach: a new header, of the same length and different, with a
   different 4 bit Version, to carry 31 bits of ETR address.

Internet-Draft         Ivip ETR Address Forwarding             July 2010


1.  Introduction

   This I-D draft-whittle-ivip-etr-addr-forw is an updated version of
   draft-whittle-ivip4-etr-addr-forw-01.

   ETR Address Forwarding (EAF) is a technique developed for the IPv4
   implementation of the Ivip core-edge elimination architecture.  (The
   Ivip-arch I-D [I-D.whittle-ivip-arch] contains an overall description
   of the system.  A glossary of some Ivip and scalable routing terms
   and acronyms is: [I-D.whittle-ivip-glossary].

   Ivip has been devised primarily as a scalable routing solution but
   could also be used as the basis for the TTR Mobility architecture,
   for both IPv4 and IPv6.  [TTR Mobility] If Ivip was introduced in a
   global fashion, as is needed for solving the routing scaling problem,
   then for IPv4 it should either be introduced using encapsulation as
   the tunneling method between ITRs and ETRs, with eventual transition
   to the more efficient and simpler EAF technique - or be introduced
   with EAF only.  The latter approach involves introduction only after
   upgrading most or all DFZ routers and some internal routers - but
   perhaps this will be possible by the time Ivip is introduced.  If
   Ivip, or something like it was introduced as part of a commercial
   system to support TTR mobility, then this upgrade to the DFZ routers
   etc. could not be contemplated, and the system would use
   encapsulation.  Nonetheless, any such independent Ivip-like system
   should contain the EAF capability, or have it easily added, since in
   the long-term it costs almost nothing to upgrade the DFZ routers and
   because EAF eliminates encapsulation overhead and some complex Path
   MTU Discovery problems.

   This I-D explores a method of modifying the IPv4 header to carry a 30
   bit ETR address.  This would require modifications to DFZ and all
   other routers between ITRs and ETRs.  If these upgrades could be
   implemented, it might be better to instead implement a new protocol,
   with a different value in the four Version bits, and the same header
   length.  Then, all 31 bits could be used to carry the ETR address -
   so enabling greater freedom in the placement of ETRs.

   The Internet's routing and addressing scaling problem, as discussed
   in RAWS [RFC4984] has given rise to a number of Core-Edge Separation
   (CES) proposals which create a new form of address space for end-user
   networks.  The term SPI (Scalable Provider Independent) space is used
   here to describe this form of address space.

   In the absence of a successful CES system, most of demand driving the
   unsustainable growth in the number of advertised prefixes is likely
   to arise from hundreds of thousands or millions of end-user networks
   wanting their own conventional BGP advertised PI prefix - since this

Internet-Draft         Ivip ETR Address Forwarding             July 2010


   would remain the only method by which each such end-user network
   could be multihomed and by which its address space could be portable
   between ISPs.

   SPI space is portable between different ISPs (providers) and can be
   used for multihoming - including the use of inbound Traffic
   Engineering (TE) to control the balance of ingress traffic over the
   links from multiple providers.

   The purpose of the CES system is to make SPI space highly attractive
   to user networks of all sizes, and to ensure that their use of this
   space is highly scalable.  Only if the new type of space is
   attractive to the great majority of end-user networks will it be
   possible to ensure that most such networks choose to use this space,
   rather than the conventional BGP approach to PI space, which is the
   main cause of the routing scaling problem.

   To be scalable, each SPI end-user network's address space must not be
   a separately advertised BGP prefix.  More generally, the interdomain
   routing system with the CES extensions should be able to scale
   gracefully to millions and perhaps billions of SPI-based end-user
   networks.

   CES systems achieve this goal be retaining provider prefixes in the
   existing core routing system, whilst excluding individual SPI (edge)
   prefixes.  This gives rise to the term Core-Edge Separation scheme.
   An early use of this term was in a taxonomy by Jari Arkko in July
   2008 [Arkko-2008a] [Arkko-2008b] [Arkko-2008c].

   The CES architecture for which EAF is intended is Ivip
   [I-D.whittle-ivip-arch].  This involves ITRs (Ingress Tunnel Routers)
   tunneling a packet to an ETR (Egress Tunnel Router), typically in
   another provider network, where the ETR forwards the packet to the
   destination end-user network.  If the tunneling is done with
   encapsulation, then there are problems due to the inefficiency of
   encapsulation overhead, and regarding RFC 1191 Path MTU Discovery.
   These can be overcome, by adding complexity to the ITRs and ETRs RFC
   1191 PMTUD [PMTUD-Frag].

   ETR Address Forwarding (EAF) would eliminate both problems - but
   requires upgrades to the FIBs of all routers between any ITR and any
   ETR.  This includes most or all DFZ routers, and many internal
   routers.

   EAF is somewhat related to Prefix Label Forwarding (PLF) [PLF] - an
   IPv6-only system which also involves using bits in the existing IP
   header in a novel fashion.  As with EAF, there is no encapsulating
   header so there is no overhead or worsening of PMTUD difficulties.

Internet-Draft         Ivip ETR Address Forwarding             July 2010


   While EAF causes the upgraded packet to be forwarded to the ETR, PLF
   causes it to be forwarded it to a border router of the destination
   ISP network.

   A brief description of EAF is that the ITR sets bit 48 of the IPv4
   header to 1 and 30 other bits of the header (currently used for the
   More Fragments flag, the Fragment Offset field and the Header
   Checksum) are then used to carry the 30 most significant bits of the
   ETR's address.  Routers (core BGP routers and some internal routers)
   with upgraded functionality recognise the EAF formatted header, and
   forward the packet to the ETR according to this address, rather than
   according to the destination address.  The ETR converts the header
   back to its normal state and delivers the packet to the destination
   network.  Routers sending ICMP messages, such as Packet Too Big or
   other messages in response to traceroute, perform a similar
   conversion on the upgraded header to reconstruct the IPv4 version of
   the packet - so PMTUD works directly for all routers between the ITR
   and the ETR.

1.1.  Advantages

   EAF has the following advantages over encapsulation:

   1.  There is no transmission overhead - the packet is not made any
       longer.

   2.  Conventional RFC 1191 PMTUD is supported over the entire path,
       including between the ITR and ETR, without any involvement of the
       ITR.

   3.  Traceroute should work over the entire path.

   Avoiding encapsulation overhead is a major long-term benefit,
   especially for VoIP packets.

   The retention of conventional RFC 1191 PMTUD through the ITR to ETR
   path removes the need for a great deal of complexity which would
   otherwise be required in ITRs and ETRs which use encapsulation.
   While that complexity could be implemented in ITRs and ETRs, it will
   be highly desirable to avoid this, and the consequent need for the
   protocols, occasional probe packets, reply packets etc.  A discussion
   of the arrangements necessary to handle PMTUD problems [PMTUD-Frag]
   gives some idea of the extra complexity, state etc. required in ITRs
   and ETRs for any practical map-encap system.

   A survey of higher level protocols' references to bits within the
   IPv4 and IPv6 headers [Checksums] shows that none of these protocols
   depend on the bits which are changed in the EAF formatted IPv4

   header.

1.2.  Disadvantages

   The major disadvantage of EAF is the need to upgrade the capabilities
   of most or all DFZ routers, and likewise any internal routers between
   ITRs or ETRs and the border routers.  However, since the upgraded
   functionality is relatively slight compared to the current
   functionality of these routers, it seems likely that many existing
   routers could be upgraded with a firmware update.  The upgraded
   functionality is only in the FIB.  RIB and BGP functions remain
   unaltered.

   As discussed below, EAF ITRs do not accept fragmented packets, or
   fragmentable packets longer than some globally agreed constant, which
   would be somewhat below 1500 bytes.  However, similar or identical
   restrictions would apply to an encapsulation system which properly
   handled PMTUD problems [PMTUD-Frag].

   RFC 1191 PMTUD will have been available for 20 years by the time any
   practical scalable routing system is deployed.  The design of such a
   system should not be constrained by hosts which avoid RFC 1191 and
   instead burden the network with the task of fragmenting packets which
   exceed the PMTU to the destination host - and which likewise burden
   the destination host with the re-assembly task.

   Care must be exercised to ensure that packets with the new EAF format
   IPv4 headers are only forwarded to upgraded routers, or to an ETR.
   Any other device will regard the header as malformed, and could be
   expected to drop the packet without generating any ICMP message.

   EAF provides only the 30 most significant bits of an ETR address.
   This means that ETRs can be located no more densely than one every 4
   IP addresses.  This is not expected to be a problem, since it is
   common for routers to each use a /30 prefix.

2.  Other uses of bit 48, AKA Flag 0 or Evil bit

   In August 2008, Fred Templin alerted me to other proposals for using
   bit 48 of the IPv4 header.

   Bob Briscoe and colleagues have an extensive I-D regarding "re-ECN" -
   a new approach to Explicit Content Notification.  This I-D has been
   in active development since 2005: "Re-ECN: Adding Accountability for
   Causing Congestion to TCP/IP draft-briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp-08":
   [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp].

   Two other proposals regarding bit 48 are cited in briscoe-tsvwg-re-
   ecn-tcp.  Firstly, a 2005 BT Journal paper by J. Adams and colleagues
   and secondly RFC 3514 which I discuss below.  The aims of the J.
   Adams et al paper would apparently be met by the proposal of Bob
   Briscoe and colleagues.

   Fred also mentioned that some ca. 2002 proposals from Jim Fleming
   proposed new uses of IPv4 header bits, and setting bit 48 to 1.
   Searching for "Jim Fleming" with "IPv8" and "IPv16" turns up a number
   of mailing list discussions, but I can find no sign of ongoing
   development of these proposals from ca. 1998 and 2002.

3.  Ivip for IPv4 with or without encapsulation

   There are two approaches to Ivip for IPv4: Encapsulation at first,
   transitioning to EAF in the long term; and EAF only.  Ideally, it
   would be possible to introduce Ivip with EAF only - so avoiding the
   need for many complex functions in ITRs and ETRs.  If this was not
   possible, then Ivip would be introduced using encapsulation, but with
   all ITRs and ETRs ready to switch to EAF as soon as the routers have
   been upgraded.  The long term benefits of no encapsulation overhead
   and straightforward PMTUD are very significant.

   In the long term, the cost of upgrading all routers to handle EAF
   will be small compared to the benefits of avoiding encapsulation
   overhead and the tricky PMTUD management arrangements.  The cost of
   including EAF functionality in all ITRs and ETRs will be very low -
   so a properly designed system should be able to transition to using
   EAF exclusively whenever the core and internal routers are able to
   support it.  The details of this transition are for future work.

4.  Fragmented and Fragmentable Packets

   EAF involves some important restrictions on the packets which will be
   accepted by ITR for tunneling to an ETR.

   Fragments will not be accepted.  Neither will be fragmentable packets
   longer than some globally agreed limit - MinCoreMTU - likely to be
   set at about 1470 bytes.  The same restrictions would be necessary
   for encapsulation in order to properly manage PMTUD problems and to
   avoid inefficient traffic patterns such as from fragmenting 9k
   packets into smaller than 1500 byte fragments [PMTUD-Frag].  There
   are two reasons for these restrictions.

   Firstly, it is undesirable for the network in general and the ITR-ETR
   system in particular to have to carry fragmented packets.  All host
   operating systems support RFC 1191 (1990) PMTUD and 20 years later,
   applications can reasonably be expected to use it - rather than
   sending out packets as long as the next hop MTU and expecting routers
   and the receiving host to do extra work if the PMTU to the host is
   less than the packet's length.  In the mid-1990s, fragmentation in
   the network was judged unworthy of inclusion in IPv6.  Since a core-
   edge separation system for IPv4 may be in operation indefinitely,
   since it would be much harder to engineer such a system to cope with
   fragmented and fragmentable packets, and since few hosts currently
   send fragmentable packets longer than the proposed ~1470 byte limit,
   it is best to simplify the system design by setting these limits on
   the types of packets it handles.

   Secondly, it is not possible to implement EAF with ITRs accepting
   fragments, or with the packets sent by ITRs being fragmented en-route
   to the ETR.

   The EAF system will carry fragmentable packets which are no longer
   than MinCoreMTU.  After these packets emerge in their original form
   from the ETR, they may be fragmented en-route to the ETR.

   Currently it is common for fragmentable packets to be sent across the
   Internet's core.  For instance, Google servers typically send TCP
   packets as long as the mutually negotiated MSS value allows, with the
   Google server offering an MSS of 1430.  [DFZ-unfrag-1470] This can
   result in the servers sending DF=0 packets of up to 1470 bytes long.

5.  Choice of MinCoreMTU value

   Ivip ITRs will drop incoming fragmentable packets which exceed a
   particular length: MinCoreMTU.  The value of this global constant
   must be chosen with some care.

   The primary or sole reason for making it a high value is the
   desirability of rejecting fewer fragmentable packets.

   The primary reason for making it lower is because all ITRs and ETRs
   must be located such that every ITR has a PMTU to every ETR of at
   least MinCoreMTU bytes.

   At present, it is common for there to be 1500 byte MTU limits at many
   locations in the core of the Internet.  It is also common for servers
   to be connected with 100Mbps Ethernet switches, even when they have
   Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.  One reason for this is the simple
   expedient of limiting each server's ability to create peak outgoing
   packet rates which would overload upstream links. 100Mbps Ethernet
   switches typically impose a 1500 byte MTU, while an Ethernet switch
   operating with all ports running at 1Gbps typically enables an MTU on
   all links of ~9k bytes.

   It is highly desirable to maximise the flexibility with which ITRs
   and ETRs can be located.  The deeper they can be located in networks
   - the further from the border routers - the more numerous they can be
   and so the better the total load can be shared amongst them.
   Furthermore, it will be possible to implement the ITR function in the
   sending host.  This is likely to involve zero incremental cost, on
   the reasonable assumption that the host has sufficient CPU and memory
   capacity to spare.  In the current Ivip design, ITFH (ITR Function in
   sending Host) hosts cannot be behind NAT.  They may be on
   conventional addresses or on the new kind of SPI address.

   Even in the long-term future, it is safe to assume that there will be
   1500 byte MTU limits in some part of the Internet or edge networks
   through which ITR to ETR packets will travel.  For the foreseeable
   future, MinCoreMTU must be somewhat below 1500 bytes.  It is unlikely
   that a higher value could be contemplated in the future, and by then,
   hopefully, there would be no impetus to alter it, since (hopefully)
   there would be no remaining applications still sending fragmentable
   packets across the core.

   Choosing a lower value, such as 1400 bytes, would make for few
   restrictions in the location of ITRS and ETRs, but would cause more
   trouble with hosts which currently send DF=0 packets longer than
   this.  The task is to find a value which is as high as possible
   without unreasonably restricting the potential locations of ITRs and

   ETRs.  Ideally, the value would not constrain existing widespread use
   of fragmentable packets.

   The final decision about MinCoreMTU's value will be made some years

   Figure 3: IPv4 header bits as used in EAF format.

   ITRs will write bits 0 to 29 of the ETR address into the F bits shown
   in Figure 3 in an order TBD.

6.1.  The evil bit 48

   RFC 791 defines bit 48 as Flag Bit 0: "reserved, must be zero".

   RFC 3514 [RFC3514] redefines this bit as the "evil" bit "E": "Benign
   packets have this bit set to 0; those that are used for an attack
   will have the bit set to 1."

   However - while the Internet is awash with packets which upon close
   inspection are found to be of questionable moral integrity - RFC 3514
   has not been widely implemented.

   We therefore retain RFC 3514's nomenclature of "E" and define new
   semantics for bit 48 (Flag 0) as the EAF flag: setting it to 0 to
   denote the conventional IPv4 header format and to 1 to denote the EAF
   usage of the abovementioned bits.

      |E|
      +-+


   Currently-assigned values are defined as follows:

   0  The packet's header bits conform to RFC 791 semantics.

   1  The packet's header bit 50 to 63 and 80 to 95 contain the 30 most
      significant bits of an address which upgraded routers will use to
      determine forwarding, rather than the destination address.  In
      addition, the header will be subject to special processing as
      described below to restore its state to that of a conventional
      IPv4 header, in the event that it is either received by an ETR or
      to be included in an ICMP message.

6.2.  More Fragments flag and Fragment Offset

   As mentioned above, ITRs will drop all packets which are fragments.
   Consequently, the states of the More Fragments flag (bit 50) and the
   Fragment Offset bits (bits 51 to 63) are all zero when the packet is
   accepted to be tunneled to an ETR.  Whenever the packet is converted
   back to the conventional IPv4 header format, all these bits will be
   set back to zero.

6.3.  Header Checksum

   Since the EAF format is used for the packet's travel from the ITR to
   the ETR, and since the IPv4 Header Checksum bits are used for another
   purpose, the routers in that path - all of which must have the
   upgraded functionality which recognises the EAF formatted header -
   will not check the header's integrity via any checksum facility.

   Significant problems due to transmission processing errors are not
   anticipated, primarily due to the low error rate in most L2 layer
   implementations.  These low error rates were presumably considered
   when the IPv6 header was designed without any header checksum.  The
   possible bit error scenarios are discussed in Appendix 1.

   The checksum will be recalculated by the ETR when it converts the
   packet to normal IPv4 format, or by a router en-route to the ETR
   which needs to convert the packet to this format in order to send an
   ICMP message to the sending host.

7.  Reconstructing the normal IPv4 header

   ITRs are the only devices which are required to convert an ordinary
   IPv4 header into an EAF formatted IPv4 header.  We discuss that
   functionality in a section below.  Here we discuss a function which
   needs to be performed by ETRs, and in some circumstances by any of
   the upgraded routers between the ITR and ETR.  Since most ITRs also
   have the additional capabilities of a upgraded router, most ITRs need
   the following functionality as well.

   ETRs perform this operation when they accept a packet forwarded from
   an ITR - to convert the packet into an ordinary IPv4 packet to be
   forwarded to the destination network.  Upgraded routers (including
   ITRs) may need to convert the packet back to its IPv4 format in order
   to include the packet, or part of it, in an ICMP message.

   The first step in converting the header is to set bit 48 and bits 50
   to 63 to 0.  As noted previously and in the following section on
   converting the packet to EAF format, all packets which are accepted
   by an ITR have the MF flag and all Fragment Offset bits set to 0.

   The second step is to calculate a new Header Checksum from the
   current state of the header, after bits 80 to 95 have been set to 0.
   Once this is value is written into bits 80 to 95, the packet is
   identical to that accepted by the ITR, except for the lower value of
   TTL which results from the EAF format packet having passed through
   routers, and for the consequently different Header Checksum.

8.  ITR Functionality

   This section formally defines the functions the ITR performs when EAF
   forwarding a packet, which are additional to its basic functionality
   documented elsewhere regarding deciding which packets need to be
   tunneled to an ETR, which ETR to tunnel them to etc.

   In an encapsulation system, the ITR encapsulates the packet in an IP
   header with the outer header's destination address being that of the
   ETR.  (The details vary - for instance Ivip only uses an IP header,
   while LISP uses IP, UDP and then a LISP header.)

8.1.  Rejecting fragments or fragmentable packets which are too long

   The first step of EAF processing involves rejecting packets which are
   fragments, or which are fragmentable but longer than MinCoreMTU.  In
   both cases, the packets are dropped and an ICMP message sent to the
   sending host, including some number of bytes of the original packet.

   There is an unresolved question about what type of ICMP message to
   send in these circumstances.  The sending host will not be expecting
   an ICMP PTB (Packet Too Big: Type 4 Fragmentation required, and DF
   flag set) message.  There is no point defining a new ICMP message,
   since the problem only arises from hosts which are not using RFC 1191
   PMTUD or which are ignoring future BCP guidance not to send
   fragmentable packets which are longer than MinCoreMTU to any host
   which is reachable only via the ITR-ETR network.  If the host OS and
   application could be upgraded to accept a new kind of ICMP message,
   it would be better to upgrade them to never to send fragments or
   fragmentable packets.

8.2.  Setting bit 48

   The router sets bit 48 to 1.

8.3.  Writing the ETR address

   The router writes the 30 most significant bits of the ETR address
   into bits 50 to 63 and 80 to 96.  The packet's header is now valid
   according to the EAF format.

8.4.  Forwarding according to the ETR address

   Generally, ITRs are conceived of as additional functions built into a
   conventional internal or border router.  However, there are two
   instances where this is not the case.  Firstly, the ITR functions can
   be built into a sending host, which has no routing functions, due to
   it having a single link to its network.  Secondly an ITR could be



Whittle                  Expires January 9, 2011               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft         Ivip ETR Address Forwarding             July 2010


   implemented as a device which advertises prefixes in the local
   routing system (or in the DFZ, with a DITR, in LISP known as a Proxy
   Tunnel Router), and which converts the packet to the EAF format (or
   encapsulates it).  However the ITR has a single link to its network
   and therefore makes no forwarding decisions about the resulting EAF
   (or encapsulated) packet.

   Where the ITR function is in a device with no routing functions, the
   next step is to forward the packet out of the one interface which
   leads to the upstream router.  This router must have upgraded
   functionality so it recognises the EAF formatted packet.

   When the ITR functions are performed within a router (necessarily
   with EAF functionality), the next step is to present the EAF
   formatted packet to the FIB - which will forward the packet to or
   towards the ETR address specified in bits 50 to 63 and 80 to 95.
   This new forwarding functionality is described in the next section.

   Also, when the ITR function takes place in a router, the router's FIB
   must be able to generate an ICMP message as described in the next
   section if the EAF formatted packet cannot be forwarded.

   Converting the packet from conventional IPv4 format to EAF format
   does not involve decrementing the TTL value.  The subsequent
   forwarding step in the ITR itself, or in whichever upstream router
   the ITR sends the packet to, will decrement the packet's TTL.

Internet-Draft         Ivip ETR Address Forwarding             July 2010


9.  Upgraded Router Functionality

   The additional functionalities described in this section must be
   present in all internal and DFZ routers through which the EAF
   formatted packet travels between the ITR and the ETR.  These
   additional functionalities must also be present in ETRs and in any
   ITR which is itself a router.

9.1.  Recognizing the EAF format

   The router must recognise bit 48 being set as indicating that the
   packet should be handled somewhat differently, as described below,
   rather than discarded.

   The packet can be treated as an ordinary IPv4 packet in all respects
   apart from those mentioned in this section.

9.2.  No checksum calculations

   The router still decrements TTL and sends an ICMP message if it
   reaches zero.  Therefore, Traceroute will work over the ITR to ETR
   part of the path.  However, there is no checking of the header's
   checksum, or altering the former checksum bits to account for the
   change to the TTL bits.

9.3.  Forward according to 30 bit ETR address

   Instead of forwarding the packet according to its destination
   address, the 30 bit ETR address in bits 50 to 63 and 80 to 95 is
   used, and extended to 16 bits with two zeroes in the least
   significant bits.

   Any filtering, statistics gathering etc. regarding source and
   destination address can proceed as usual.

   The EAF formatted packet should not be forwarded to any router which
   is not upgraded to handle it - therefore it must be forwarded to an
   upgraded router or to an ETR.  (An EAF-formatted packet may also be
   forwarded to an upgraded router with ITR capabilities, but the ITR
   function in that router will ignore it, since it is already in EAF
   format.)  However it is not a task of the router to ensure that the
   next hop router is upgraded.  This requirement must be achieved by
   ensuring that only upgraded routers advertise prefixes by which ETRs
   can reached.

Internet-Draft         Ivip ETR Address Forwarding             July 2010


9.4.  ICMP generation

   There are a variety of circumstances in which an ordinary router may
   drop a packet and send an ICMP message to the sending host, including
   TTL reaching zero, the packet being DF=1 and too long for the next-
   hop MTU, and there being no path to forward the packet on.

   Upgraded routers use the same criteria for these actions as with
   normal packets, except that the address for determining next hop is
   the ETR address bits, not the destination address.  (An ICMP
   destination network unreachable packet which results from this
   contains the reconstructed Internet header, which contains the
   destination address and no mention of the ETR address.)

   In order to create an ICMP message which includes the start of the
   original packet, the router first reconstructs the header into
   ordinary IPv4 format - as described in a section above.

   Packets will also be dropped if their length exceeds the next hop
   MTU, with an ICMP PTB message being sent to the sending host.  Again,
   in the resulting ICMP message, the attached start of the packet will
   contain no mention of the ETR address or of the EAF format of the
   packet at the router where this MTU limit was exceeded.

9.4.1.  RFC 1191 PMTUD with much less complexity than with encapsulation

   In an encapsulation system such as LISP where the outer source
   address is that of the ITR, a router generating a PTB would send it
   to the ITR, requiring arguably impossible amounts of state and
   processing in the ITR to securely transform it into an appropriate
   PTB message addressed to the sending host [ITR-complexity].
   (Authenticating the original PTB involves storing huge quantities of
   state of recently tunneled packets, and altering the MTU value in the
   PTB to a lower value, before writing it into the PTB to be sent to
   the sending host.  The alteration is to account for the encapsulation
   overhead, so the sending host will send packets short enough not to
   exceed the MTU limit, once encapsulated.)

   In Ivip's encapsulation approach, the outer source address is that of
   the sending host.  The PTB would go back to the sending host, but be
   ignored, since it resulted from an encapsulated packet.  There is a
   method of ensuring PMTUD works with Ivip's encapsulation approach
   [PMTUD-Frag], but this involves undesirable complexity in the ITR and
   ETR.

   One of the most important benefits of EAF over encapsulation is that
   the router which generates a PTB message as just described generates
   a PTB message which will always be recognised by the sending host.

Internet-Draft         Ivip ETR Address Forwarding             July 2010


   The MTU value it contains is the correct value to make the sending
   host emit packets of the right length.  This is because there is no
   encapsulation overhead, and because the router is able to reconstruct
   the traffic packet into a form identical to that which would be
   expected by the sending host after it has passed through any routers
   before reaching the router where the MTU limit was exceeded.

   The above-mentioned method of reconstructing the ordinary IPv4
   version of the packet does not alter the DF flag.  It sets the More
   Fragments flag and the Fragment Offset bits to zero - which is in
   accordance with the fact that the ITR only accepts packets with those
   bits set to zero.

   It is a requirement of the whole system - in terms of the placement
   of ITRs and ETRs, the placement of upgraded routers, and the MTUs of
   the paths between them all - that an EAF packet can be sent from any
   ITR to any ETR without encountering a non-upgraded router.  An
   additional condition is that the MTUs of all these paths must be at
   least MinCoreMTU bytes.

   Consequently, no upgraded router will handle a fragmentable packet
   (DF=0) which exceeds the next hop MTU.  (Once the EAF packet has been
   converted to an ordinary IPv4 packet at the ETR, it may hit an MTU
   limit - at the ETR's next-hop or at the next-hop of subsequent
   routers - and so be fragmented by that router according to
   established principles.)

   Therefore, PTB messages will only be generated for DF=1 packets.
   Conventional RFC 1191 PMTU will function correctly and the sending
   host will send subsequent packets with lengths which do not exceed
   the current router's next-hop MTU.

10.  ETR Functionality

   We assume that the ETR has sufficient functionality to recognise a
   packet whose destination address matches an end-user network it
   connects to, and that the ETR is able to transport an ordinary IPv4
   packet with such a destination address to that destination network.
   This may be achieved by forwarding in the local routing system, by
   tunneling or by forwarding the packets out of a specific interface
   which leads directly to that destination network.

   We assume that the ETR also has the extra functionality of upgraded
   routers, but this is minimal and would only in fact be needed if the
   ETR was functioning as a router handling packets with EAF addresses
   of other ETRs.  This would be the case if the ETR was a CE or PE
   router, and there were any ITRs inside the end-user network it serves
   - those ITRs or ITR functions in hosts would be sending EAF packets
   upstream, to be forwarded to other ETRs.

   With this assumption, the functionality required of an ETR is very
   minimal.

   When an ETR receives a packet in EAF format, it must recognise if the
   ETR address in the header matches its address (or one of its
   addresses).  If not, then if the ETR device functions as a router
   (that is, it has two outgoing interfaces to the rest of the network)
   then it must have the upgraded router functions.  In that case, it
   will forward the packet to whichever interface has a path for that
   ETR's prefix - or drop the packet and generate an ICMP destination
   network unreachable message as described above.

   Assuming the ETR recognises the ETR address in the EAF formatted
   header as corresponding to itself, then the ETR converts the header
   to ordinary IPv4 format as described above and then processes it
   normally - which includes transporting the packet to the destination
   network.

11.  ITR and ETR placement: MTU and upgraded routers

   EAF provides a much simpler method of transporting packets from ITR
   to ETR than encapsulation.  This can best be appreciated by
   considering what has to be done in an ITR to ETR encapsulation system
   to support RFC 1191 PMTUD.  EAF is also 100% efficient, with no
   overhead from encapsulating headers.

   However, EAF requires that all routers between ITRs and ETRs - in the
   core and in internal networks - be upgraded to handle the new header
   format.  It would not be surprising if these changes can be
   implemented with existing routers via a firmware upgrade by the time
   Ivip4 or any comparable core-edge separation system is deployed.

   There are actually two requirements on routers between any ITR and
   any ETR - which in turn sets limits on where ITRs and ETRs can be
   located.  Firstly, the intervening routers must be upgraded to handle
   EAF format.  Secondly, the PMTU between all these routers, and
   between the ITRs and ETRs and their neighbouring routers, must be at
   least MinCoreMTU bytes.

11.1.  PMTU and MinCoreMTU

   In practice, with a wisely chosen value of MinCoreMTU, the PMTU
   requirement should not prove too constraining.  For instance,
   MinCoreMTU = 1470 enables fragmentable packets to be carried without
   fragmentation over a DSL service, with 8 bytes of overhead due to
   PPPoE, and for instance 28 bytes of IPv4 + UDP or GRE tunnel
   overhead.

   The sole purpose of MinCoreMTU is to support hosts currently sending
   DF=0 packets.  It is not a constraint on how long DF=1 packets can
   be.  As the core of the Net changes so that PMTUs of 9k or so become
   commonplace, hosts with 9k next-hop MTUs will naturally send 9k
   packets to destination hosts all over the world, where possible.
   EAF's uncomplicated support of RFC 1191 enables all sending hosts to
   adapt quickly to any lower PMTU it must comply with on the path to
   any particular destination host.

11.2.  Core and internal router upgrades

   The biggest hurdle an EAF-only system would need to overcome is the
   task of upgrading essentially all core routers to handle EAF-
   formatted packets.  "Core" routers in this context includes provider
   border routers.  In this discussion we refer to four kinds of
   network: ordinary provider networks, upgraded provider networks,
   ordinary end-user networks and SPI end-user networks.

   Ordinary provider networks and ordinary end-user networks do not
   contain any ITRs or ETRs.  Therefore, these ordinary provider
   networks cannot be used by an SPI network.  By definition, an
   ordinary end-user network is not used by any SPI or any other end-
   user networks for connectivity to the Net, because then it would be
   functioning as a provider network.

   SPI end-user networks do not have any routers connected to the BGP
   interdomain core.  All their border routers (CE - Customer Edge)
   either link to ETRs in one or more upgraded provider networks - or
   the upgraded provider network provides a link (from a PE - Provider
   Edge - router) to the CE router, which itself functions as an ETR.

   With encapsulation, it is possible to locate ITRs in a provider
   network which has no ETRs.  Likewise, ITRs could be located in
   conventional end-user networks which connect to provider networks
   which lack ITRs or ETRs.  In these cases, the purpose of the ITRs is
   to encapsulate packets from local sending hosts, rather than send
   those packets to the core and rely on DITRs (Default ITRs in the DFZ)
   to do the encapsulation.

   However, with EAF, this flexibility of locating ITRs deep within
   provider and end-user networks is restricted by the need to ensure
   all internal routers, (provider) border routers and connected core
   routers are upgraded to handle EAF packets - and that the PMTUs of
   all links equal or exceed MinCoreMTU bytes.

   Within all networks, and the core, there is no need to upgrade a
   router if it can be assured that it never advertises a prefix which
   ITRs or ETRs are located within.  For networks with internal ITRs,
   including ITR functions in the sending hosts, this means that most or
   all internal routers need to be upgraded.  Likewise, for any upgraded
   provider network which houses ETRs.

   With the exception of their CE routers (which have direct links to
   provider networks), SPI end-user networks never contain ETRs.  ETRs
   must be located on conventional address space, and so can only be in
   upgraded provider networks.  However, it is possible to have a link
   from the ISP to the CE router, which functions as an ETR, operating
   from the ISP-provided (PA) conventional address.  (Again, a
   conventional end-user network with an ETR is not an end-user network
   for the purposes of this discussion, since it is providing
   connectivity to some other network, including perhaps parts of its
   own network which use SPI space.)

   Any SPI end-user network, upgraded provider network or upgraded
   conventional end-user network may contain ITRs - in which case these
   networks need upgraded internal routers to handle all EAF packets

   emitted by these ITRs.

   There may be routers in the core which do not need to be upgraded:
   any border router of any network which contains no ITRs or ETRs, and
   (the next condition may be impossible to assure) any transit router
   which never handles prefixes which contain ETRs.  This means that
   networks which do not want to use ITRs or ETRs need take no action
   while other networks upgrade their routers to support EAF.  Hosts
   within these non-upgraded networks will still have full connectivity
   to hosts in SPI end-user networks, via DITRs.

   There may be some techniques within the BGP control plane to restrict
   the advertisement of ETR-containing prefixes only to routers which
   have been upgraded.  This may be a fruitful technique in the event
   that some core routers remain without the EAF upgrades.  However,
   this does not alter the requirement that there be enough core routers
   with EAF capabilities to ensure robust connectivity between all ITRs
   and ETRs.

   In a transitional arrangement, where Ivip with encapsulation is
   progressively converted to EAF, any such BGP techniques could prove
   valuable in ensuring that for each prefix in which all ETRs are
   reachable via EAF upgraded internal routers, such prefixes are only
   advertised to upgraded core routers.  However, the most attractive
   option remains to upgrade the core routers to EAF capabilities from
   the outset of operations, and therefore avoid the need to implement
   encapsulation with all its attendant complexities to handle PMTUD.

   Why should ISPs want to upgrade their core routers?  Perhaps because
   they could do so for minimal cost with a firmware upgrade, and
   because by doing so they are making it more possible to implement a
   core-edge separation system without the inefficiencies and
   complexities of encapsulation.

   Why would router vendors want to develop such upgrades for their core
   routers - and make them available, at minimal cost?  Perhaps because
   they want to contribute to the establishment of the most efficient
   scalable routing solution, and/or because they would not want their
   installed routers to be viewed as being incapable of supporting the
   modest enhancements this entails.

   Upgrading sufficient (most, or ideally all) core routers remains the
   biggest challenge to deploying a scalable routing system based on EAF
   from the outset.  Quite a few years development needs to be done on
   these proposals before a sufficiently strong global consensus could
   be reached to choose and implement one scheme.  By then, it may be
   relatively easy to upgrade the core routers within the desired
   timeframe.

   Similar principles apply to internal routers.  These are likely to
   include a larger variety of models, including more older, non-
   upgradable, models than in the core.  However, to the extent that it
   is harder or impossible to upgrade these older, smaller, routers, it
   is also true that they are less expensive and more due for
   replacement.  So the incremental cost of replacing them in order to
   support an EAF-only scalable routing solution is not necessarily
   prohibitive.

12.  Security Considerations

   Other than the extremely unlikely possibility of bit errors causing a
   packet to be presented to an upper layer protocol at some host other
   than the desired destination (Appendix 1) the EAF techniques do not
   appear to create any security problems beyond those inherent in the
   routing system or in the encapsulation approach to ITR to ETR
   tunneling.

   IPsec Authentication Header is unaffected by EAF.

   Where a border router - or any other router - handles the EAF format
   packet (this is necessarily a router with upgraded functionality
   which recognises the EAF format) the router can still perform
   filtering on the packet according to its source and destination
   addresses, and any other aspects of the packet - since only bit 48,
   the MF flag, fragment offset bits and the header checksum have been
   altered.  Consequently EAF should not reduce the effectiveness of
   existing filtering arrangements.

Appendix A.  Scenarios where bit errors alter the EAF formatted header

   Bit errors are unlikely to go undetected by L2 protection mechanisms.
   In the unlikely event that such errors are undetected, it is highly
   unlikely that the packet would be forwarded to a node which accepts
   it.  Silent packet loss is an acceptable outcome in the event of an
   bit errors in the header.  The only outcome of concern would be the
   packet arriving at the wrong node and being recognised, so that it is
   accepted by an upper level protocol.  This would disrupt that node,
   and potentially lead to information being divulged to the wrong
   recipient.  However, the chances of this occurring are remote, as the
   following exhaustive discussion indicates.

A.1.  Error in bit 48

   An error in bit 48 (setting it to zero) will cause the packet to be
   recognised by the recipient router as an IPv4 packet.  That router
   will test the header against the presumed checksum in bits 80 to 95 -
   which are in fact part of the ETR's address.  There is a 2^-16 chance
   that the header would pass this test.  Of those which do, the great
   majority can be expected to have at least one of bits 51 to 63 set,
   indicating to the receiving host that this packet is a fragment.  The
   resulting packet would be forwarded towards whichever router
   advertises a prefix which matches the destination address.

   Assuming the destination address is unaltered, since the destination
   address is an SPI address and is part of an Ivip MAB (Mapped Address
   Block) the packet would be forwarded to the nearest DITR which
   advertises this MAB.  There it would be dropped, unless either: (1)
   all bits 50 to 63 were zero; or (2) bits 51 to 63 were zero, bit 50
   was 1 and the packet was shorter than MinCoreMTU bytes.  In the
   unlikely event the bit was not dropped by the DITR, it would be
   turned back into a valid EAF format packet and forwarded to the ETR
   specified in the mapping for the packet's destination address - and
   so arrive correctly at the destination host in spite of the bit
   errors!

   If there were also errors in the destination address bits, then the
   packet would be forwarded to some host which is not its intended
   destination.  (If the altered destination address was an SPI address,
   then it would be forwarded to a DITR and most likely be dropped, as
   just described.)  Assuming the damaged packet was delivered to some
   host other than its intended recipient, the IP layer of the recipient
   host would fail to pass the packet upwards unless it was received
   with all bits 50 to 63 set to zero.  If bit 50 was set, this would
   indicate that more fragments were to follow - yet no more fragments
   would be received.  If any bits 51 to 63 were set, this would
   indicate this packet was a second or subsequent fragment - yet no

Internet-Draft         Ivip ETR Address Forwarding             July 2010


   other fragments would be received.

   Even if the packet was passed upwards, the changed destination
   address bits would have a 65,535 / 65,536 chance of being detected by
   the checksum of the higher level protocol header: UDP (if a checksum
   was used), TCP, DCCP and UDP-Lite.  IPsec AH would also detect the
   altered destination address with one of its hash functions.  ICMP,
   IGMP, RSVP, GRE, ESP, OSPF and SCTP would not detect the altered
   destination address [Checksums].  However this would only occur after
   a series of highly improbable - and unfortunate - events.

A.2.  Errors in bits 50 to 63 and 80 to 96

   Assuming bit 48 was unaltered (still set to 1), an error in any of
   the other modified bits 50 to 63 and 80 to 95 would cause the packet
   to be forwarded to a different 30 bit ETR address than the one set by
   the ITR.

   There is a remote chance, this may result in the packet arriving at
   another ETR which accepts the packet, due to this ETR recognising the
   destination address as one belonging to an end-user network it
   connects to.  More likely, the packet would be forwarded to the wrong
   address.  If there was an ETR at that address - which is unlikely -
   the packet would most likely be dropped because that ETR does not
   recognise the destination address as matching one of its end-user
   networks.  Alternatively, the packet may be recognised by an upgraded
   router as having a forwarding address which did not match any prefix
   for which it has a path - in which case the router would drop the
   packet and generate an ICMP destination network unreachable message.
   Another alternative is that the packet would arrive at a host or at a
   non-upgraded router - in which case a host would drop the packet due
   to bit 48 being set.

   In the scenarios mentioned in this subsection and the one before -
   all involving errors in the bits which have new functions in the EAF
   format - there is an extremely low probability that the packet would
   arrive at a node other than its intended destination in a form which
   caused it to be presented to any upper layer protocol.

A.3.  Errors in bits other than 50 to 63 and 80 to 96

   Initially, we discuss changes to bits in the header other than bit
   48, or 50 to 63 and 80 to 96 - assuming them to be unchanged.  It is
   assumed the packet arrives at the correct ETR, which converts the
   header into an ordinary IPv4 format, calculating a fresh checksum.
   In this scenario, the resulting packet will contain any altered bits
   we consider below, with a checksum which matches the altered state of
   those bits.  Consequently, we may expect the altered packet to be

Internet-Draft         Ivip ETR Address Forwarding             July 2010


   sent to the correct recipient host, where the altered bits may have a
   variety of impacts.

   Changes to bits 0 to 3 would result in the packet being dropped by
   any router, including the ETR or any router between the ITR and the
   ETR, due to it failing to have the proper IP version bits.

   Changes to bits 4 to 7 (header length) would probably result in the
   packet being dropped by a router - due to the value being too low, or
   indicating that there were options in the header which the router
   does not accept or recognise.  If such a packet was forwarded to the
   recipient host, it is unlikely that the altered header length would
   allow the packet to be accepted as valid by the IP layer of any
   receiving host.

   Changes to the DiffServ and ECN bits would go undetected, but since
   the error is a random event affecting a single packet, it is unlikely
   that any serious negative consequences would arise.

   Changes to the Identification field would go undetected in most
   instances.  The only exception which comes to mind are ping packets.
   Identification is used for reassembling fragmented packets, but the
   ITR does not accept fragmented packets.  If a fragmentable packet
   (less than MinCoreMTU in length) was emitted by an ETR with an
   altered Identification field, and then fragmented en-route to the
   destination host, there would almost certainly be no ill effect,
   since the value of the Identification field in all the fragments
   would be the same.  Only in some extreme circumstances might a
   changed Identification field prove problematic: when it is changed to
   the value of another packet which is also fragmented, and where there
   is some out of order delivery, so disrupting the host's ability to
   correctly reassemble the two packets.  This would result in data loss
   of one packet, and potential data loss in the packet which was
   reassembled.

   Changes to the TTL bits 64 to 71 would generally go unnoticed, but
   the consequences are at most the loss of the packet and the
   generation of a spurious ICMP Time Exceeded message.

   Changes to the Next Protocol bits 72 to 79 would probably result in
   the packet not being accepted due to lack of an appropriate protocol
   handler in the destination host.  In the event that the new value was
   accepted, it would not match the first four bits of the next header
   and so the packet would be dropped.

   Changes to the source or destination address would be detected by
   many protocols, as noted above at the end of the subsection "Error in
   bit 48".

   Bit errors in both the EAF bits and in others would result in more
   complex scenarios, but for the present discussion, it suffices to
   conclude that this is extremely unlikely to result in anything worse
   than data loss, and that comparable problems are considered
   acceptable in IPv6.

Appendix B.  Applicability to core-edge separation schemes other than
             Ivip

   There is nothing in EAF which depends on any other aspect of Ivip,
   such as the fast hybrid fast-push mapping distribution system.
   However, there would be little point in applying EAF to any system
   which required extra bits to be sent with each traffic packet.

   LISP requires such data to be included with each traffic packet: The
   encapsulation involves an IP header, a UDP header and then a LISP
   header.  EAF could not be applied to a system such as LISP.  Also,
   the vision of simplicity of EAF-only Ivip involves no communication
   between ITRs and ETRs.  LISP involves messages going back and forth
   between ITRs and ETRs for purposes including testing reachability.

   Earlier versions of this ID discussed two core-edge separation
   schemes - APT and TRRP - which in late 2009 were no longer being
   developed, since they were not submitted as proposals for the IRTF
   Routing Research Group's final recommendation.

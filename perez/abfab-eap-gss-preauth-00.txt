                GSS-EAP pre-authentication for Kerberos
                  draft-perez-abfab-eap-gss-preauth-00

Abstract

   This draft defines an alternative to the standard cross-realm
   operation in Kerberos, to allow users from an organization can obtain
   a TGT from the KDC of a different one, both belonging to the same
   AAA-based federation.  This proposal makes use of the GSS-API pre-
   authentication for Kerberos and the GSS-API Mechanism for the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol to carry out the required
   functionality.

1.  Introduction

   Kerberos [RFC4120] is becoming one of the most widely deployed
   protocols for authentication and key distribution, as it is
   integrated in different operating systems and network applications
   (FTP, SSH, HTTP...).  However, Kerberos usage is typically used to
   control the access of the subscribers of a single organization, since
   Kerberos multi-domain (cross-realm) infrastructures are not usually
   deployed.  This draft aims to provide an alternative to the typical
   cross-realm operation in Kerberos by making use of existing
   Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructures,
   the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] for
   authentication and the SAML [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] and XACML
   [OASIS.xacml-2.0-core-spec-os] for authorization.

   Since organizations typically deploy AAA infrastructures for
   controlling the access to services (especially network access
   service) in federated networks, the lack of a correct integration
   between Kerberos and AAA infrastructures limits the service access
   based on Kerberos only to service provider's subscribers, defeating
   the purpose of the network federations: to allow any end user in the
   federation to access any service deployed within it.  In this
   document, we define a unified architecture to integrate existing AAA
   infrastructures with the service access control based on Kerberos.
   Specifically, we propose the user to perform a pre-authentication
   process with the visited KDC based on EAP, combining the use of the
   the GSS-API pre-authentication for Kerberos
   [I-D.perez-krb-wg-gss-preauth] and the GSS-API Mechanism for the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol [I-D.ietf-abfab-gss-eap].
   Additionally, this solution also introduces authorization management
   based on the SAML and XACML standards.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Elements of the architecture

   Brief description of the elements in the proposed architecture.

   o  End User.  Integrates the functionality of Kerberos client, GSS
      initiator and EAP peer.

   o  KDC.  Integrates the functionality of Kerberos KDC, GSS acceptor
      and EAP authenticator.

   o  AAA server.  Integrates the functionality of the EAP server.

   o  Identity Provider.  Generates authentication statements upon a
      request from the AAA server and attribute statements upon a
      request from the KDC.

   o  Policy Decision Point (PDP).  Manages the set of access control
      policies for the domain of the KDC and takes authorization
      decisions based on the provided information.

   o  MetaData Service (MDS).  Maintains a database of every service
      metadata within the federation.  The MDS can be queried by any
      member of the federation to obtain information about other
      member's public service [OASIS.saml-metadata-2.0-os].

   o  Application Server.  Provides a service valuable to the End User,
      whose access is controlled by means of the Kerberos protocol.


3.  Operation

3.1.  Discovery of the KDC

   In federated environments, where users move between different
   organizations, the specific location of the KDC in any visited domain
   should by dynamically discovered by the End User.  This may be
   achieved by the use of DNS SRV RR queries as defined in [RFC4120] or
   the DHCPv6 protocol as defined in [I-D.sakane-dhc-dhcpv6-kdc-option].

3.2.  Pre-authentication with the KDC

   Once the KDC location is known by the End User, the pre-
   authentication process is performed as depicted (in a very simplified
   way) in Figure 1.  A detailed description of these steps is provided
   following.

Internet-Draft               GSS-EAP preauth                    Jun 2011


             Figure 1: EAP-GSS pre-authentication with the KDC

   1.   Kerberos client calls to GSS_Init_sec_ctx() to obtain the a GSS
        token to be sent to the KDC.  Details on this process are
        described in [I-D.perez-krb-wg-gss-preauth].  The selected GSS
        mechanism is GSS-EAP, defined in [I-D.ietf-abfab-gss-eap].

   2.   The GSS_Init_sec_ctx() call is treated by the GSS-EAP mechanism,
        which generates the actual GSS token following the
        specifications provided in [I-D.ietf-abfab-gss-eap].  Usually,
        this GSS token will contain an EAP response message.  At this
        level, the GSS-EAP mechanism will use the EAP identity of the
        End User.

   3.   Once the Kerberos client has obtained the GSS token, it is
        encapsulated into a PA-GSS-TOKEN pre-authentication data element
        and included into the KRB_AS_REQ message (as specified in
        [I-D.perez-krb-wg-gss-preauth]).  The user may belong to a
        different organization than the KDC and, therefore, its client
        name may not be found in the KDC's local database.  To avoid the
        generation of an error of type KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN, the
        Kerberos client sets the cname field of the KRB_AS_REQ message
        to a new fixed value, WELLKNOWN:FEDERATED, following the model
        proposed in [RFC6111].  In this manner, the KDC is warned that
        the End User belongs to the federation and not local
        verification of credentials should be done.

   4.   On the reception of the KRB_AS_REQ message, the KDC omits the
        local database lookup of the client name, since WELLKNOWN:
        FEDERATED is indicated.  Then, the KDC calls the
        GSS_Accept_sec_ctx() function, as described in
        [I-D.perez-krb-wg-gss-preauth], to process the GSS token
        received in the PA-GSS-TOKEN pre-authentication data element.

   5.   The GSS_Accept_sec_ctx() call is treated by the GSS-EAP
        mechanism, which extracts EAP packet contained on it, determines
        the AAA server where it should be forwarded and encapsulates it
        into the proper AAA protocol (i.e.  RADIUS or Diameter), as
        described in [I-D.ietf-abfab-gss-eap].

   6.   The AAA server processes the EAP packet and generates a new EAP
        Request for the End User.  If the response is an EAP Success,
        the process continues in step 10.  Otherwise, the AAA server
        encapsulates the EAP packet into a AAA message and sends it to
        the KDC.  Note: For simplicity, AAA proxies are not considered.
        More details are provided in [I-D.ietf-abfab-gss-eap].

Internet-Draft               GSS-EAP preauth                    Jun 2011


   7.   The GSS-EAP mechanism in the KDC processes the AAA message and
        generates a new GSS token with the obtained EAP request.

   8.   As a result of the call to the GSS_Accept_sec_ctx() function,
        the KDC obtains the GSS token, which is encapsulated into a new
        PA-GSS-TOKEN element and sent to the Kerberos client into a
        KRB_ERR message with code MORE_PREAUTH_DATA_REQUIRED as
        specified in [I-D.perez-krb-wg-gss-preauth].  This KRB_ERR
        message also contains a PA-FX-COOKIE element where the KDC
        introduces the value of the context handle obtained after the
        call.

   9.   The Kerberos client processes the KRB_ERR message, obtains the
        GSS token and calls to the GSS_Init_sec_ctx() function.  The
        process continues as defined in step 1.

   10.  If the AAA server determines that the authentication has been
        completed, before sending the proper message to the KDC it
        contacts with its local IdP to obtain an SAML Authentication
        Statement.  This is accomplished by sending a SAML AuthnRequest
        message to the IdP, indicating the EAP identity as the value of
        the Subject.  This message is generated following the SOAP-based
        authentication profile described in
        [LIBERTY.idwsf-authn-svc-v2.0].  Alternatively, the IdP could be
        collocated with the AAA server.  In this case, this and the next
        step would be omitted as the AAA server could issue the SAML
        Assertion by itself.  Another option would be that the KDC
        generates the SAML AuthnRequest instead of the AAA server, since
        it will be the ultimate consumer of the produced Assertion.

   11.  The IdP authenticates the user based on the trust established in
        the organization between the AAA server (acting as the attester)
        and the IdP, and generates a SAML Assertion in response.  This
        Assertion, which contains an Authentication Statement, will be
        used to refer to this authentication process in the future (e.g.
        to request attributes).

   12.  The AAA server verifies the Authentication Statement and
        encapsulates the Assertion into an SAML-AAA attribute (e.g.
        following the [I-D.howlett-radius-saml-attr].  Then it sends the
        AAA response message to the KDC including this attribute along
        with the EAP Success packet and the derived MSK.

   13.  The GSS-EAP mechanism processes the AAA response as described in
        [I-D.ietf-abfab-gss-eap].  The EAP identity is exported as
        initiator name.  This name will also include the received
        Assertion as an attribute, following the specifications in GSS-
        naming [I-D.ietf-kitten-gssapi-naming-exts].  The MSK is used to

        derive the GMSK.

   14.  The KDC obtains, as a result of the last call to the
        GSS_Accept_sec_ctx(), the final GSS token, and the initiator
        name.  As described in [I-D.perez-krb-wg-gss-preauth], the token
        is encapsulated into a PA-GSS-TOKEN, while the initiator name is
        used as the cname field in both, the KRB_AS_REP message and the
        TGT.  Furthermore, the KDC obtains, using the
        GSS_Get_name_attribute(), the SAML Assertion.  This Assertion is
        included in a new authorization data element (ADE) into the
        authorization_data field of the TGT.  By this way, the TGS will
        receive the Assertion in the KRB_TGS_REQ.  Following the
        specifications in [I-D.perez-krb-wg-gss-preauth], the KDC uses
        the GSS_Pseudo_random() call to generate the reply key with
        which encrypting the enc-part of the KRB_AS_REP message
        (Replacing-reply-key facility)

   15.  Finally, the Kerberos client processes the KRB_AS_REP message.
        As a first step, the PA-GSS-TOKEN is processed as specified in
        [I-D.perez-krb-wg-gss-preauth].  The GSS-EAP mechanism extracts
        the EAP packet from the token and derives the MSK and the GMSK.
        The Kerberos client uses the GSS_Pseudo_random() call to
        generate the reply key, and decrypts the enc-part of the
        KRB_AS_REP message.  After that, the Kerberos client stores the
        TGT into the credentials cache associated to the identity
        indicated in the cname field.

3.3.  Authorization

   With the TGT, the End User can request Service Tickets (ST) for the
   different services in the domain by means of a TGS exchange.  In this
   process, the TGS can take an authorization decision based on the
   identity information of the End User, thanks to the authorization
   information (i.e.  Assertion) the AS included in the TGT.  Both the
   service and the client are completely agnostic of this authorization
   process, thus they do not require changes.  A simplification of the
   process is outlined in Figure 2.  A detailed description is provided
   below.

                      Figure 2: Authorization process

   1.  The Kerberos client creates a new KRB_TGS_REQ message, following
       what is specified in [RFC4120].  This message transports the TGT
       obtained during the authentication phase.

   2.  The TGS (KDC) processes the KRB_TGS_REQ message as usual.  When
       the TGS processes the authorization data element (ADE) containing
       the Assertion, it contacts with the federation's MDS to obtain
       the location of the End User's home IdP.  This information is
       required in order to contact with the End User's IdP to request
       some user attributes to perform the authorization decision.

   3.  With the metadata information the TGS is able to contact with the
       End User's IdP directly.  This contact is performed by means of a
       SAML Attribute Query message [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os], indicating
       the pseudonym of the user included in the assertion as the
       Subject.

   4.  The IdP recognises the pseudonym and provides the requested
       attributes in a SAML Response containing one or more SAML
       Attribute Statements.

   5.  The TGS provides the gathered attributes to the local PDP, along
       with information about the resource (sname) and the action to be
       performed, using an XACML AuthzDecision Query message.  With this
       information the PDP queries its local policy database and takes
       an authorization decision.  This decision is provided to the TGS
       using a XACML AuthzDecision Response message.

   6.  If the decision is PERMIT, the TGS issues the ticket for the
       requested service.  Otherwise, if the decision is DENY, the
       client is provided with a Kerberos error message and the ST is
       not delivered.

   There is one way of simplifying the authorization work-flow by
   allowing IdPs to return SAML Attribute Statements during the first
   step of the authorization phase.  In this case, the AAA server will
   receive a SAML Attribute Statement holding the end user attributes
   along with the Authentication Statement in the Assertion.  This way
   the MDS Query and the Attribute Query exchanges could be omitted,
   since the Assertion already contains the required information.
   However, this approach does not allow the IdP to discriminate what
   attributes should be returned based on the preferred services,
   because they are known in the KRB_TGS exchange.

3.4.  Access to the Application Service

   With the ST, the user can access the Application Service using
   standard Kerberos, as described in [RFC4120]


4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  AAA/EAP key management in Kerberos

   The use of EAP for Kerberos pre-authentication has security
   implications, specially in key distribution and management.  The
   security analysis described in [RFC4962] and [RFC5247] are applicable
   here.  Indeed, intermediate AAA proxies placed between the KDC and
   the home AAA server can observe the distributed MSK that will be used

   to derive the Kerberos secret key.

   However, the trust model in federated environments assumes that
   intermediate AAA proxies are trusted entities.  Moreover, as
   [RFC4962] explains, some key wrapping techniques can be applied to
   provide confidentiality, integrity and replay protection to the
   distributed key material between each pair of AAA entities (e.g.  AAA
   proxies).

4.2.  Trust relationships

   This work assumes the existence of a transitive trust relationship
   for authentication between the involved domains thanks to the
   deployed AAA infrastructure.  Besides, regarding the authorization
   process, it is generally assumed the use of a direct trust
   relationship, allowing the protection of SAML messages directly
   between domains (step 2 and 3).  Usually PKI architecture are used to
   deploy this trust.  Following this approach IdPs and KDCs should be
   fed with cryptographic material.

   Nevertheless, other approach can be followed to avoid the deployment
   of an additional infrastructure (e.g.  PKI).  We could leverage the
   transitive trust relationship defined by the deployed AAA
   infrastructure to perform safely the attribute recovery process by
   means of the AAA protocol.  In this case, it is necessary to define
   new extensions to standard AAA protocols.

Abstract 

   This document extends the pNFS protocol to communicate errors caused 
   by inability to access data servers referenced by layouts, including 
   checks performed by both clients and the MDS. The extension provides 
   means for clients to communicate client-detected access denial errors 
   to the MDS, including the case in which a client requests direct NFS 
   access via the MDS that the MDS cannot perform.

                           Figure 1 pNFS Architecture  
    

   In this document, "storage device" is used as a general term for a 
   data server and/or storage server for the file, block or object pNFS 
   layouts. 

   The current pNFS protocol [RFC5661] assumes that a client can access 
   every storage device (SD) included in a valid layout sent by the MDS 
   server, and provides no means to communicate client access failures 
   to the MDS. Access failures can impair pNFS performance scaling and 
   allow significant errors to go unreported. If the MDS can access all 
   the storage devices involved, but the client doesn't have sufficient 
   access rights to some storage devices, the client may choose to fall 
   back to accessing the file system using NFSV4.1 without pNFS support; 
   there are environments in which this behavior is undesirable, 
   especially if it occurs silently. An important example is addition of 
   a new storage device to which a large population of pNFS clients 
   (e.g., 1000s) lack access permission. Layouts granted that use this 
   new device, result in client errors, requiring that all I/Os to that 
   new storage device be served by the MDS server. This creates a 
   performance and scalability bottleneck that may be difficult to 
   detect based on I/O behavior because the other storage devices are 
   functioning correctly.

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check             July 2010 
    

   The preferable approach to this scenario is to report the access 
   failures before any client attempts to issue any I/Os that can only 
   be serviced by the MDS server.  This makes the problem explicit, 
   rather than forcing the MDS, or a system administrator, to diagnose 
   the performance problem caused by client I/O using NFS instead of 
   pNFS. There are limits to this approach because complex mount 
   structures may prevent a client from detecting this situation at 
   mount time, but at a minimum, access problems involving the root of 
   the mount structure can be detected. 

   The most suitable time for the client to report inability to access a 
   storage device is at mount time, but this is not always possible.   
   If the application uses a special tag or a switch to the mount 
   command (e.g., -pnfs) and syscall to declare its intention to use 
   pNFS, at the client, the client can check for both pNFS support and 
   device accessibility. 

   This document introduces an error reporting mechanism that is an 
   extension to the return of a pNFS layout; a pNFS client MAY use this 
   mechanism to inform the MDS that the layout is being returned because 
   one or more data servers are not accessible to the client. Error 
   reporting at I/O time is not affected because the result of an 
   inaccessible data server may not be an I/O error if a subsequent 
   retry of the operation via the MDS is successful. 

   There is a related problem scenario involving an MDS that cannot 
   access some storage devices and hence cannot perform I/Os on behalf 
   of a client. In the case of the block layout [RFC5663] if the MDS has 
   no access to a storage device (e.g., LUN), MDS implementations 
   generally do not export any filesystem using that storage device.  In 
   contrast to the block layout, MDSs for the file [RFC5661] and object 
   [RFC5664] layouts may be unable to access the storage devices that 
   store data for an exported filesystem.  This enables a file or object 
   layout MDS to provide layouts that contain client-inaccessible 
   devices. For the specific case of adding a new storage device to a 
   filesystem, MDS issuance of test I/Os to the newly added device 
   before using it in layouts avoids this problem scenario, but does not 
   cover loss of access to existing storage devices at a later time. 

   In addition, [RFC5661] states that a client can write through or read 
   from the MDS, even if it has a layout; this assumes that the MDS can 
   access all the storage devices. This document makes that assumed 
   access an explicit requirement.

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Changes to Operation 51: LAYOUTRETURN (RFC 5661) 

   The existing LAYOUTRETURN operation is extended by introducing two 
   new layout return types: 

   o  LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS at fsid scope; and 

   o  LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_NO_ACCESS at file scope. 

   The former returns all layouts for the FSID and informs the server 
   that the reason for the return is a storage device connectivity 
   problem, and the latter performs the same function for an individual 
   file layout. 

3.1. ARGUMENT (18.44.1) 

   The ARGUMENT specification of the LAYOUTRETURN operation in section 
   18.44.1 of [RFC5661] is replaced by the following XDR code [XDR]: 

     /* Constants used for new LAYOUTRETURN and CB_LAYOUTRECALL */ 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE      = 1; 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID      = 2; 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL       = 3; 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS    = 4; 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_NO_ACESSS    = 5; 
      
     enum layoutreturn_type4 { 
          LAYOUTRETURN4_FILE = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE, 
          LAYOUTRETURN4_FSID = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID, 
          LAYOUTRETURN4_ALL  = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL, 
          LAYOUTRETURN4_FSID_NO_ACCESS = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS, 
          LAYOUTRETURN4_FILE_NO_ACCESS = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_NO_ACCESS 
     }; 
 
     struct layoutreturn_file4 { 
           offset4         lrf_offset; 
           length4         lrf_length; 
           stateid4        lrf_stateid;

           /* layouttype4 specific data */ 
           opaque          lrf_body<>; 
     };  
 
     struct layoutreturn_fsid_no_access4 { 
           deviceid4     lrfna_deviceid; 
           nfsstat4      lrfna_status; 
     }; 
 
     struct layoutreturn_file_no_access4 { 
           offset4         lrfna_offset; 
           length4         lrfna_length; 
           stateid4        lrfna_stateid; 
           deviceid4       lrfna_deviceid; 
           nfsstat4        lrfna_status; 
           /* layouttype4 specific data */ 
           opaque          lrfna_body<>; 
     }; 
 
     union layoutreturn4 switch(layoutreturn_type4 lr_returntype) { 
           case LAYOUTRETURN4_FILE: 
                   layoutreturn_file4             lr_layout; 
           case LAYOUTRETURN4_FSID_NO_ACCESS: 
                   layoutreturn_fsid_no_access4   lr_fsid<>; 
           case LAYOUTRETURN4_FILE_NO_ACCESS: 
                   layoutreturn_file_no_accesss4  lr_layout; 
           default:                               void; 
     }; 
 
3.2. RESULT (18.44.2) 

   The RESULT of the LAYOUTRETURN operation is unchanged; see section 
   18.44.2 of [RFC5661]. 

 
3.3. DESCRIPTION (18.44.3) 

   The following text is added to the end of the LAYOUTRETURN operation 
   DESCRIPTION in section 18.44.3 of [RFC5661]: 

   There are two NO_ACCESS layoutreturn_type4 values that indicate lack 
   of storage device access, LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS and 
   LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_NO_ACCESS.  A client uses these values to return 
 
 
Faibish et al.         Expires January 9, 2011                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check             July 2010 
    

   all layouts for an FSID or to return a layout (or portion thereof) 
   for a file, and in both cases to inform the server that the reason 
   for the return is an inability to access one or more storage devices. 
   The same stateid may be used or the client MAY force use of a new 
   stateid in order to report a new error. An NFS error (nfsstat4) is 
   included in the layoutreturn data structures for these two types to 
   distinguish access permission problems from device inaccessibility: 

   o  NFS4ERR_PERM SHOULD be used for access permission denial; and 

   o  NFS4ERR_NXIO SHOULD be used for inability to access a device. 

   Other NFS errors MAY be used when they are appropriate. All uses of 
   these two layout return types that report errors SHOULD be logged by 
   the client. 

   The client MAY use the new LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_NO_ACCESS instead of 
   LAYOUT_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS when it has reason to believe that only 
   one, or a small number of files are affected.  If the problem affects 
   multiple devices, the client may use multiple file layout return 
   operations to communicate the multiple devices encountering errors; 
   each return operation SHOULD return a layout extent obtained from the 
   device for which an error is being reported. In contrast, 
   LAYOUT_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS includes an array of <device, status> 
   pairs to enable errors to be reported for multiple devices in one 
   operation so that the client is not required to repeat the FSID-
   scoped layout return operation to report multiple errors.  

3.4. IMPLEMENTATION (18.44.4) 

   The following text is added to the end of the LAYOUTRETURN operation 
   IMPLEMENTATION in section 18.4.4 of [RFC5661]: 

   A client that expects to use pNFS for a mounted filesystem SHOULD 
   check for pNFS support at mount time.  This check SHOULD be performed 
   by sending an OPEN request, a LAYOUTGET operation and a GETDEVICELIST 
   operation, followed by layout-type-specific checks for accessibility 
   of each storage device returned by GETDEVICELIST.  If the NFS server 
   does not support pNFS, the LAYOUTGET operation will be rejected with 
   an NFS4ERR_NOTSUPP error; in this situation it is up to the client to 
   determine whether it is acceptable to proceed with NFS-only access.   

   When an I/O fails because a storage device is inaccessible, the 
   client SHOULD retry the failed I/O via the MDS.  In this situation, 
   before retrying the I/O, the client SHOULD return the layout, or 
   inaccessible portion thereof, and SHOULD indicate which storage 
   device or devices was or were inaccessible.  If the client does not 
 
 
Faibish et al.         Expires January 9, 2011                 [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check             July 2010 
    

   return at least the inaccessible portion of the layout before the I/O 
   retry via the MDS, and that I/O retry fails with NFS4ERR_PERM or 
   NFS4ERR_NXIO, then the client MUST return at least the inaccessible 
   portion of layout, as the MDS error indicates that the affected 
   portion of that file is completely inaccessible to the client. 

   Backwards compatibility may require a client to perform two layout 
   return operations to deal with servers that don't understand the 
   NO_ACCESS layoutreturn_type4 values and hence respond with 
   NFS4ERR_INVAL. In this situation, the client SHOULD perform an 
   ordinary FSID or file layout return operation and remember that the 
   new return types are not to be used with that server. 

   The metadata server (MDS) SHOULD NOT use storage devices in pNFS 
   layouts that are not accessible to the MDS.  To the extent that an 
   MDS can determine whether storage devices are accessible to clients, 
   an MDS SHOULD NOT include a storage device in any pNFS layouts sent 
   to a client that cannot access that storage device. At a minimum, the 
   server SHOULD perform these storage device accessibility checks 
   before exporting a filesystem that supports pNFS and when the device 
   configuration for such an exported filesystem is changed (e.g., to 
   add a storage device). A client MAY perform I/O via the MDS even when 
   the client holds a layout that covers the I/O; servers MUST support 
   this client behavior.   

4. Security Considerations 

   All control operations from the MDS to the storage devices, including 
   any operations required for access permission checks, SHOULD be 
   authenticated in order to maintain integrity of stored data. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations in this document beyond pNFS IANA    
   Considerations are covered in [RFC5661]. 

6. Conclusions 

   This draft specifies additions to the pNFS protocol addressing client 
   and MDS server inability to access storage devices used in pNFS 
   layouts for all layout types.

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check            March 2010




Abstract

   This document extends the pNFS protocol to communicate the results of
   permission checks for access to the data servers referenced by
   layouts, including checks performed by both clients and the MDS. The
   extension provides means for clients to communicate client-detected
   access denial errors to the MDS, including the case in which a client
   requests direct NFS access via the MDS that the MDS cannot perform.

   Inconsistent access permissions expose a gap in the pNFS protocol.
   The pNFS protocol assumes that a client can access every storage
   device (SD) included in a valid layout sent by the MDS server, and
   provides no means to communicate client access failure to the MDS. It
   has been argued that this is an implementation detail, but access
   failures permission denials can impair the performance scalability
   value of pNFS and allow errors to go unreported. There is no pNFS
   error mechanism to inform a system administrator that a client lacks
   permission to access a storage device at mount time or when I/O is
   performed. There is a related problem when an MDS doesn't have access
   permission to some storage devices and hence cannot perform I/O on
   behalf of a client. In this document storage devices are a generic
   term for data servers and/or storage servers used by the file, block
   and object pNFS layouts.

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check            March 2010


   In the case of the block layout [RFC5663] if the MDS has no access to
   a storage device (LUN) implementations are generally unable to export
   the NFS mount point for any filesystem using that storage device.  In
   this situation, clients will be unable to mount that file system and
   an error will presumably be logged by the MDS server. If the MDS can
   access all the storage devices involved, but the client doesn't have
   sufficient access to some storage devices/LUNs, at mount time the
   client may choose to mount the file system using NFSV4.1 without pNFS
   support (fallback to NFS).  This failure to mount as a pNFS file
   system cannot currently be communicated to the server because there
   are no protocol messages defined which convey this failure.

   The above discussion also applies to the file and object layout pNFS
   clients regardless of whether the MDS has permissions to access the
   storage devices, with one important difference.  In contrast to the
   block layout, MDSs for the file and object layouts are often unable
   to access the storage devices that store data for the exported
   filesystem.  This make it significantly easier for a file or object
   layout MDS to provide layouts that contain inaccessible devices, in
   contrast to the block layout where an MDS should not allow a client
   to mount a FSID to which the MDS has no access permission.

   There is no error reporting mechanism in the pNFS protocol for this
   type of error. Even if we correct the access permission issue the
   introduction of a new error reporting mechanism at I/O time for both
   server and client can be problematic as it may be too chatty. We
   propose to introduce a new error case but leave the error reporting
   mechanism at I/O time OPTIONAL or an optimization to the latitude of
   the server and client implementation.

   Although the change to the protocol is delicate, logging some kind of
   warning at the client might be appropriate as an implementation
   option on the client to reduce chattiness.



1.1. Example

   A motivating use case is addition of a new storage device to which
   all the pNFS clients (1000s of them) lack access permission. Layouts
   cannot be granted that use this new device, requiring that all I/Os
   to that new storage device be served by the MDS server creating a
   performance and scalability bottleneck that may be difficult to
   detect based on I/O behavior.

   A better approach to this issue is to report the access failure
   before the client attempts to issue any I/Os that can only be

   serviced by the MDS server.  This makes the problem explicit, rather
   than the forcing the MDS, or a system administrator to diagnose the
   performance problem caused by client I/O using NFS instead of the
   pNFS layout. There are limits to this approach because complex mount
   structures may prevent a client from detecting this situation at
   mount time, but at a minimum, access problems involving the root of
   the mount structure can be detected. See section 1.2.1 for a detailed
   example.

   This document adds error reporting mechanisms to address both this
   situation and situations in which the client cannot detect the access
   problem until it attempts to perform I/O to the inaccessible storage
   device.

1.2. Issues with the current pNFS protocol

   Scenario of Interest: Client expects to be able to use pNFS (e.g.,
   use -pnfs switch to mount command, or similar), but one or more
   storage devices are inaccessible.  This discussion does not apply to
   a client that doesn't care whether pNFS is used (e.g., uses pNFS to
   optimize if available, but for which it is acceptable that access is
   performed via the main NFS server).

   Desired client behavior: Client gets the entire storage device list
   for a mount point from server and checks it as part of the mount
   operation (or at whatever point it first realizes that it expects to
   use pNFS).

   Missing protocol functionality: Client has no obvious way to report
   an inaccessible storage device to the server.

1.2.1. Client access permission denial to SD

   A client doesn't communicate to the MDS server that the client's
   access to a storage device is denied as a result of an access
   permission issue. When the pNFS server grants a layout to the client,
   it assumes the client can access the storage devices (files, LUNs, or
   objects). The server cannot check this because the server cannot
   issue I/Os via the client and because connectivity is not transitive
   - the client may have good network connectivity to the MDS, the MDS
   may have good storage connectivity to the storage devices, but
   something prevents the client from talking to one or more of the
   storage devices. This could be a network mis-configuration or
   failure, and is a possible scenario for all pNFS layout types.

   This access permission problem cannot be reported by the MDS server
   when the client mounts the filesystem for several reasons. First, the

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check            March 2010


   MDS pNFS server doesn't know whether the client supports or intends
   to use pNFS. Second, the MDS NFS server doesn't know that the client
   is mounting the NFS filesystem (there is no explicit mount operation
   in NFSv4). Third, it is unreasonable to expect the MDS to know and
   check the entire mount structure below the mount point used by the
   client. For example, if the client mounts "/", the file systems below
   "/" may have pNFS capabilities, but refer to different storage
   devices. Or the client may mount say "/a/b/c/d", where "d" uses a
   pNFS capable storage device, but the client subsequently does I/O to
   "e/f/g/h/i/j/k", where "k" is either not pNFS capable or uses a
   storage device different from the storage device used by "d".

1.2.2. MDS access permission denial to SD

   The current pNFS server protocol doesn't require MDS data access to
   the storage devices. Although the MDS is not required to check
   permissions, it is assumed that the devices are correctly configured
   when the pNFS filesystem is initialized on the MDS server and
   exported. Even if the administrator checks the MDS access permission
   to all storage devices during initial configuration, the problem may
   surface at a later point in time when a new storage device is added
   or other changes are made. For the specific case of adding a new
   storage device, an MDS check of I/Os to the newly added device before
   using it in layouts avoids this set of problems, but this does not
   cover loss of MDS access to existing storage devices.

1.2.3. New MDS Requirement

   The metadata server (MDS) SHOULD NOT use storage devices in pNFS
   layouts that are not accessible to the MDS.  To the extent that an
   MDS can determine whether storage devices are accessible to clients,
   if a client cannot access a storage device, an MDS SHOULD NOT include
   that storage device in a pNFS layouts sent to that client.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Description of the proposed approaches to solution

   There are several possible solutions.  The first is to implement a
   new operation, LAYOUTRETURN4x that returns layouts to the MDS along
   with error information.  Clients that receive an NFS4ERR_NOTSUPP
   error SHOULD mark the server as not supporting this operation and use
   LAYOUTRETURN instead.


Faibish et al.        Expires September 5, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check            March 2010


   Another possible approach is to make use of the opaque field
   available in LAYOUTRETURN.  One could define part of this field for
   all layout types.  In the case that the pNFS client has a valid
   layout on a file but cannot perform I/O to a SD due to lack of access
   permission, the client will fall back the I/O to the MDS NFS server.
   Before the client sends the I/O to the NFS server it sends a
   LAYOUTRETURN command for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary MDS
   CB_LAYOUTRECALL operations in the future. The client sends the
   LAYOUTRETURN operation for every layouts that uses to the
   inaccessible SD and includes an error reporting that the reason for
   the fall back to the NFS server is an access permission denial to the
   specific deviceid4. The client may return disjoint regions of the
   file by using multiple LAYOUTRETURN operations within a single
   COMPOUND operation. The client will include NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY
   in the new LAYOUTRETURN operation.

   A third approach is to introduce a new LAYOUTRETURN type at FSID
   scope such as LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS, i.e., return all
   layouts for this FSID and tell the server that the reason for the
   return is a connectivity issue. In order to differentiate the
   permission issue from a real connectivity issue the solution will
   require the client to do two LAYOUTRETURN operations to deal with
   servers that don't understand the new type. The two LAYOUTRETURN
   operations happen once per client using
   LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS and only in an error case followed by
   a second operation for the existing FSID scope to interoperate with
   an MDS that doesn't understand the new scope.

3.1. Defining the opaque fields of LAYOUTRETURN

3.1.1. ARGUMENT

   When the LAYOUTRETURN operation specifies a LAYOUTRETURN4_FILE_return
   type, then the layoutreturn_file4 data structure specifies the region
   of the file layout that is no longer needed by the client. For each
   layout type we define the opaque lrf_body so that it can communicate
   an error code to the server as well as the deviceid4 which
   encountered the error.  This has already been defined for the object
   layout type [RFC5664]

   For the file layout we define the opaque body as follows:

   struct nfsv4_1_file_layoutreturn4 {
           deviceid4      lrf_deviceid;
           nfsstat4       lrf_status;
   };



Faibish et al.        Expires September 5, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check            March 2010


   An MDS server should check the length of the lrf_body.  If the length
   is zero, then the client has not communicated additional information
   with the layout return.  This will generally be the case when a file
   is closed, or in response to a CB_LAYOUTRECALL operation.

   For the block layout type, we similarly define the block specific
   structure as:

   struct pnfs_block_layoutreturn4 {
           deviceid4      lrf_deviceid;
           nfsstat4       lrf_status;
   };

   The alternative, which is more complex is to make the status (error)
   and deviceid4 common to all LAYOUTRETURN operations, but do so by
   adding a new operation or a new return
   type(LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_ERROR)

   struct layoutreturn_file_error4 {
           offset4         lrf_offset;
           length4         lrf_length;
           stateid4        lrf_stateid;
           deviceid4       lrf_deviceid;
           nfsstat4        lrf_status;
           /* layouttype4 specific data */
           opaque          lrf_body<>;
   };


3.1.2. RESULT

   The LAYOUTRETURN4res remains unchanged.


3.1.3. Description

   This solution will add a new error case to LAYOUTRETURN. The
   implementation will use LAYOUTRETURN when FSID is sent to the client.
   When the client fails an I/O as a result of access permission denial
   it will send a LAYOUTRETURN operation to the MDS server with new
   error NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY and the deviceid4 on which access
   permission was denied.

   When the server receives this error it MAY log an error to the syslog
   and perform an access permission check to the SD expecting that the

   client will fall back the I/O to the MDS. If the permission check of
   the server fails the NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY SHOULD be logged.

3.2. Implementation using a new layoutreturn_type4

   In this section we will define the use case addressed by this
   implementation.

3.2.1. ARGUMENT

     /* Constants used for new LAYOUTRETURN and CB_LAYOUTRECALL */

     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID      = 2;

           LAYOUTRETURN4_FSID = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID,
           LAYOUTRETURN4_ALL  = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL
     };

3.2.3. New LAYOUTRETURN type description

   We will use a new LAYOUTRETURN layoutreturn_type4, let's call it
   LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS, in which case the client returns all
   layouts for this FSID and informs the server that the reason for the
   return is an inability to access the device. The same stateid may be
   used or in order to report a new error client will force a new
   stateid. We will also add the mechanism to report a new error
   NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY.

   Backwards compatibility may require a client to do two layout return
   operations to deal with servers that don't understand the new
   layoutreturn_type4. If the server doesn't understand the new
   layoutreturn_type4, then the server will respond with an error code.
   The client SHOULD do an ordinary FSID return and remember that the
   new return type is not to be used with this server. This assumes that
   the client is sufficiently disrupted by the problem to decide to drop
   all layouts for the filesystem (FSID). Alternatively, for servers
   that understand the new layoutreturn when the server receives a new
   stateid it will check if there is an NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY error
   or issue an CB_LAYOUTRECALL to get the error code from the client.

3.3.3. DESCRIPTION

   In this case the client checks that it has permission access to all
   the deviceid that are included in all the layouts in his possession
   and report to the MDS deviceid with permission access denial. Using
   this operation the MDS will find out what are the SDs that have
   permission access issues for more than one client that have valid
   layouts to that device and didn't yet found that there is a
   permission access issue. In this case the MDS can prevent the client
   from falling back to NFS by recalling the layout and removing the
   faulty device from the layout thus preventing a storm of I/Os to the
   MDS. The MDS will only send a CB_LAYOUTACCESSCHECK command to clients
   that already have a valid layout for the faulty device. As an
   implementation recommendation the MDS will remove that device from
   the valid devices list and will log an error mentioning that there is
   a problem with that device. All the layouts delivered to new client
   requests will exclude the device with the problem. Some servers may
   chose to perform the I/O via the MDS with the risk of a retry and I/O
   error of the MDS. In this latest case the MDS will unilaterally
   remove that device from the list and will recall all the layouts from
   all the clients that have layouts to that device and send new layouts
   excluding the faulty device.

4. Reporting storage device inaccessibility

4.1. Access denied to client at mount time

   The most suitable time for the client reporting access denial by a
   data server is at the mount time. This would be the preferred way to
   address the issue but it is not possible with the current protocol
   for several reasons: If the server initiates the request, MDS doesn't
   know if the client wants to use pNFS or NFS. If the client is the
   initiator of the error the client is mounting the pNFS filesystem

   knowing that it will use pNFS for access but the client doesn't
   specifically request pNFS.

   The solution requires a special tag -pnfs or a switch to the mount
   command and syscall at the client. The client cannot explicitly
   request pNFS as it needs first to discover that the server is
   supporting pNFS by sending a pNFS LAYOUTGET request to the server at
   mount time. If this request fails, the resulting error cannot be
   reported by the client.

   The client will send an OPEN request to access a file  and to find if
   the NFS server is pNFS capable it will send a LAYOUTGET command and
   if the NFS server doesn't accept and returns an error the client will
   request access using plain NFS. The client will decide if this is an
   error or not. In the case that the LAYOUTGET command succeeded the
   client may still ask the MDS to deliver the I/O. So, inherently the
   client has to query the MDS for access permissions to all the SDs
   that are used in the layout sent to the client before accessing the
   deviceid included in the layout. The pNFS protocol doesn't require
   the MDS to check access permission to the devices that are included
   in the layout. It is assumed that the MDS has permission access to
   all the devices it includes in the layout without any checks.

   If the MDS doesn't know if it has access or not to a deviceid it
   shouldn't put that device in the layout granted to clients in order
   to prevent cases when the client sends the I/O using plain NFS from
   the MDS. If the MDS doesn't have permission access to a SD it will
   send an error to the client and the I/O will fail. Based on the above
   behavior the best time to check is at the time when the initial
   configuration of the pNFS filesystem is done. Currently the pNFS spec
   states that a client can write through or read from the MDS, whether
   it has a layout or not or it does not support pNFS assuming that the
   MDS has permission access to all the SDs. We propose to make this
   implicit recommendation explicit.

4.2. Permission denied to the client at I/O time

   In this case when the pNFS capable client receives a valid layout
   from the MDS server and cannot write to the storage devices, the
   client falls back to the NFS server to perform the I/O. There is no
   error currently logged by the client or sent back to the MDS server
   in this situation. The client will use the new error case added in
   section 3.1 or will use a LAYOUTRETURN including
   NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY error code as defined in section 3.2. If the
   client didn't access the SD that has the permission denial yet and it
   is not aware of such an issue the client couldn't send an error to
   the MDS. But if the MDS got a permission error for a deviceid from

   another client it can send a CB_LAYOUTRECALL with FSID_PERM_CHECK to
   the client in the case when a pNFS client requests the MDS to write
   an I/O to one of the devices from a layout sent to the client by the
   MDS before. The client will send a LAYOUTRETURN and the MDS will
   check that the error is NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY and to confirm that
   this is a permission access issue not a connectivity or other error.

4.2.1. pNFS client detects permission access denial

   The current protocol recommends that the client fallback to the
   NFSv4.1 server to do the I/O on the behalf of the client and in same
   compound command it includes a LAYOUTRETURN command for the layout
   part on the Storage Device with permission issues. The recommendation
   can be interpreted as LAYOUTRETURN of all the layouts for that file.
   According to the section 3.2 in this case the client will issue a
   LAYOUTRETURN mandatory for the layout offset in the range that
   resides on the deviceid with permission access denial together with
   the fallback of I/O to NFS. An error code NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY
   will be included in the LAYOUTRETUN command. In general fallback to
   NFS is restricted to the cases of server or client failure recovery.
   In this case the fallback will be related to the permission access
   issue as an additional case of fallback to NFS.

4.2.2. Layout command that require permissions check by the client

   Assume there is a list of devices used by a given file. The client
   attempts a write operation and fails with a permission error. The
   client will retry (fallback) the I/O via the metadata server.

   For block layout type, the client SHOULD return the layout before
   attempting to retry the I/O via the MDS. Object and file clients,
   need not return the layout before attempting to retry the I/O via the
   MDS.

   If the client returns the layout, the client SHOULD indicate which
   device caused an error (or the range of the file in which the error
   occurred).

4.2.2.1. Case 1 - MDS successfully performs I/O to the device

   MDS proactively sends an CB_LAYOUT_ACCESS_CHECK to all clients that
   have a layout referencing the storage device which recently returned
   a permission access error. The CB _LAYOUT_ACCESS_CHECK will contain a
   file handle, and a list of offsets. For file layout, the client can
   compute the data servers to which it must send an NFS ACCESS command.
   The client SHOULD issue the NFS ACCESS command on behalf of any one
   of the users that have the file currently open on each client. The

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check            March 2010


   client should then accumulate the results of all the access checks
   (there may be more than one device checked). The client returns a
   vector of device handles and statuses.

   The STATUS code is either NFS4_OK or the error code returned by the
   data store. The implementation details of how the server aggregates
   the client responses to CB_LAYOUT_ACCESS_CHECK is left as an exercise
   for the reader. In many instances if the server detects that a
   majority, or a large number of clients cannot access some devices,
   the server will issue CB_LAYOUT_RECALL to all the clients, if
   possible it will restripe (or re-layout) the file to exclude the
   failing device.

4.2.2.2. Case 2 - MDS fails to perform the I/O to the device

   This is the same as case 1, except that the server can restripe the
   file, only if the failed device does not yet contain data for the
   file. Implementations may decide to remove the failing device from
   the list of devices used for new files.

4.3. Permission denied to MDS server at I/O time

   In case when the client holding a valid layout requests the NFS
   server to execute the I/O and the MDS gets an access permission
   denial from the storage device, the MDS cannot perform the I/O and
   returns an error to the client. In this case all client I/O to that
   device will fail and the reason for these failures needs to be
   communicated to the MDS. To address this case the client will use the
   new layoutreturn_type4 operation defined in section 3.2 and the new
   NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY error code to inform the MDS of possible
   permission access issues. An additional option is to use the new
   CB_LAYOUTACCESSCHECKRECALL from section 3.3sent to the client
   requesting permission access check. On failure the MDS will log an
   error NFS4ERR_DEVICE_UNACCESSIBLE to inform the admin to correct the
   problem. On receiving the CB the client will send the SD a
   GETDEVICEINFO and report NFS4ERR_DEVICE_PERM_DENY to the MDS server
   using the new layout command from section 3.2.

5. Security Considerations

   All control operations from the MDS to the storage devices, including
   any operations required for access permission checks in order to
   detect permission denials to the MDS and the pNFS client, SHOULD be
   authenticated in order to address cases when the access permission is
   denied to the client by the administrator. It is expected that the
   permission denial to a certain data server to a certain client will

   be known to the MDS by configuration. This is applicable to all pNFS
   layout types.

6. IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document beyond pNFS IANA
   Considerations are covered in [RFC5661].

7. Conclusions

   This draft specifies additions to the pNFS protocol addressing access
   permission checks of the client and MDS server to storage devices
   used in pNFS layouts for all layout types.

          DNS SRV Resource Records for the WebSocket Protocol
                     draft-ibc-websocket-dns-srv-02

Abstract

   This document specifies the usage of DNS SRV resource records by
   WebSocket clients when resolving a "ws:" or "wss:" Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI).  The DNS SRV mechanism confers load-balancing and
   failover capabilities for WebSocket service providers.

Internet-Draft            DNS SRV for WebSocket               April 2011


1.  Introduction

   DNS SRV [RFC2782] is widely implemented in realtime communication
   protocols as SIP [RFC3261] and XMPP [RFC6120].  In both protocols the
   clients perform a DNS SRV query to get a list of connection addresses
   (pairs of IP address and port) for the given domain.  The
   administrator of the domain can configure its DNS SRV records in a
   way that they provide automatic load-balancing along with redundancy/
   failover capability.

   DNS SRV mechanism facilitates network applications scalability
   without requiring an intermediary node distributing the traffic in
   load-balancing or failover fashion.  Instead, DNS SRV mechanism just
   requires a proper DNS setup.

   By introducing DNS SRV records into WebSocket protocol
   [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol], WebSocket providers can,
   optionally, take same advantages and provide scalable services with a
   minimal infrastructure.

   This specification mandates the usage of DNS SRV resource records by
   WebSocket clients when resolving a "ws:" or "wss:" URI [RFC3986], but
   still leaves the decision of using SRV records up to the service
   administrator.

3.  Implementation

   This specification mandates the implementation of DNS SRV [RFC2782]
   in WebSocket [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol] clients (usually
   web browsers).  Said that, WebSocket clients MUST implement this
   specification.

   The client application (usually JavaScript code executed by the web
   browser) is not aware of the mechanism described in this document
   which is fully transparent for web developers and JavaScript
   developers.  This is, the client application (usually JavaScript
   code) does not deal with DNS SRV resolution but just passes the given
   "ws:" or "wss:" URI to the WebSocket client which MUST perform steps
   in Section 4.

   It is up to the system administrator whether to set, or not, DNS SRV
   resource records for the WebSocket protocol within the provided
   service.  This specification allows the system administrator to use
   the DNS SRV [RFC2782] mechanism to improve the service reliability by
   providing load-balancing and failover capabilities, but does not
   mandate it (the system administrator could choose whichever
   scalability strategy).

Internet-Draft            DNS SRV for WebSocket               April 2011


4.  Client Usage

   DNS SRV lookup just applies when the host component of a WebSocket
   URI [RFC3986] is a domain and the URI does not contain an explicit
   port.  If this is not the case, the WebSocket client MUST attempt the
   fallback process described in Section 4.2.

   To clarify it, a WebSocket URI like "ws://example.org/myservice"
   requires the client to perform SRV resolution while
   "ws://example.org:80/myservice" does not (as the port is explicitly
   present in the URI).

4.1.  SRV Lookup

   Given a WebSocket URI ("ws:" or "wss:") in which the host component
   is a domain ("example.org") and the port is not present, the
   WebSocket client MUST perform the following steps:

   1.  If the scheme is "ws:", perform a DNS SRV query whose inputs are:

       *  Service: "ws"

       *  Proto: "tcp"

       *  Name: The host component of the URI

       The resulting query looks like "_ws._tcp.example.org".

   2.  If the scheme is "wss:", perform a DNS SRV query whose inputs
       are:

       *  Service: "wss"

       *  Proto: "tcp"

       *  Name: The host component of the URI

       The resulting query looks like "_wss._tcp.example.org".

   3.  If there is no SRV result, attempt the fallback process described
       in Section 4.2 and omit next steps.

   4.  If there is SRV result, it will contain one or more DNS SRV
       resource records (combinations of a domain target, port, priority
       attribute and weight attribute as described in [RFC2782]).

   5.  Choose one of the returned DNS SRV resource records (following
       the rules in [RFC2782]) and perform DNS A or AAAA lookups on the



Baz Castillo            Expires October 16, 2011                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            DNS SRV for WebSocket               April 2011


       corresponding domain target.  This will result in a list of one
       or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

          If the DNS A or AAAA lookup returns no result, it is
          considered an error and next DNS SRV resource record
          (according to rules in [RFC2782]) MUST be tried.

   6.  Use the first resolved IP address (with the corresponding port
       number in the DNS SRV resource record) as the connection address
       for the WebSocket service.

          The client MAY now perform steps in Section 4.3 and reuse an
          existing TCP connection if available.

   7.  If the WebSocket establishment fails using that connection
       address because of a server failure (according to Section 4.4)
       but the A or AAAA lookups returned more than one IP address, then
       use the next resolved IP address for the connection address
       (keeping same port).

   8.  If the WebSocket establishment fails using all the resolved IP
       addresses for a given DNS SRV resource record, then repeat the
       process for the next DNS SRV resource record based on priority
       and weight attributes as defined in [RFC2782] until all the DNS
       SRV resource records have been tried.

   9.  If all the attempts fail, internally report the WebSocket
       establishment error.

   When the client constructs the WebSocket handshake HTTP request, the
   URI MUST be set as described in Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol] regardless of the usage of SRV
   mechanism.  This is, DNS SRV resolution for a "ws:" or "wss:" URI
   does not alter the usual construction of the WebSocket handshake
   request.

4.2.  Fallback Process

   The fallback process SHOULD be a normal A or AAAA address record
   resolution to determine the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the URI host
   component (or URI host value without DNS resolution if it contains an
   IP address).

   The server connection port is obtained as stated in Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol].

   If multiple IP addresses have been obtained from a DNS A or AAAA
   lookup, the client MUST choose the first one and try to establish a

   WebSocket communication with it.  In case such attempt fails because
   of a server failure (as defined in Section 4.4) the client MUST
   repeat the process for each remaining IP address.

4.3.  Reusing TCP Connection

   A web browser is able to maintain persistent TCP connections with the
   HTTP [RFC2616] server and reuse them for sending new HTTP requests.
   Reusing an existing connection (when available) for WebSocket
   communication is a desirable behavior which just can take place when
   both the HTTP server and WebSocket server listen on the same IP
   address and port.

   This section defines how to reuse an existing connection after
   resolving the location of the WebSocket server using the DNS SRV
   procedures:

   1.  The WebSocket client performs the steps in Section 4 and gets an
       ordered list of connection addresses (pairs of IP address and
       port) by following rules in [RFC2782].

   2.  For each connection address the client selects to communicate
       with, it first checks whether there already exists an established
       TCP connection against same IP address and port.

   3.  If so, the client MAY reuse the existing TCP connection for
       initiating the WebSocket handshake rather than opening a new one.

4.4.  Server Failure

   A WebSocket server failure occurs if the WebSocket establishment (TCP
   connection and WebSocket handshake procedure) fails because of a
   cause listed below:

   o  TCP connection is not possible due to timeout or server side
      rejection.

   o  The server does not return a valid HTTP response for the WebSocket
      handshake request within a specified ammount of time (TODO:
      specify such ammount).

   o  The server replies a 500 or 503 HTTP error response during the
      WebSocket handshake meaning that it suffers of internal problems
      (i.e. congestion) so it is not currently capable of handling the
      request.

         If HTTP response code other than 101 (success), 500 or 503 is
         returned by the server, it MUST NOT be considered a server

Internet-Draft            DNS SRV for WebSocket               April 2011


5.  Examples

   By properly configuring domain SRV records, the WebSocket service
   administrator can take advantage of load-balancing and failover
   capabilities inherent in DNS SRV [RFC2782].  Sections below show some
   usage cases.

5.1.  Load Balancing and Failover

   Assuming there are three hosts providing the WebSocket service for
   the URI "ws://example.org/myservice", the following zone file for a
   fictional example.org domain provides load-balancing and failover for
   the WebSocket traffic:


   $ORIGIN example.org.
   @         SOA   dns.example.org. root.example.org.
   (2011040501 3600 3600 604800 86400)
   NS        dns.example.org.
   _ws._tcp  SRV   0 3 80 ws1.example.org.
   _ws._tcp  SRV   0 1 90 ws2.example.org.
   _ws._tcp  SRV   1 0 80 ws3.example.org.

   dns       A     1.1.1.100
   ws1       A     1.1.1.1
   ws2       A     1.1.1.2
   ws2       A     1.1.1.3


   o  The first server with domain ws1.example.org listens on IP address
      1.1.1.1 and port 80, and its associated DNS SRV record has
      priority 0 and weight 3.

   o  The second server with domain ws2.example.org listens on IP
      address 1.1.1.2 and port 90, and its associated DNS SRV record has
      priority 0 and weight 1.

   o  The third server with domain ws3.example.org listens on IP address
      1.1.1.3 and port 80, and its associated DNS SRV record has
      priority 1 and weight 0.

   By following the steps in Section 4, 75% of WebSocket clients would
   choose the first server and the other 25% would choose the second
   server to communicate with (as both have the higest SRV priority 0 in
   their respective DNS SRV resource records, and the first server has a
   SRV weight value which triples the value of the second server).

   In case the WebSocket establishment fails because of a server failure



Baz Castillo            Expires October 16, 2011               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft            DNS SRV for WebSocket               April 2011


   (as defined in Section 4.4), WebSocket clients would try the other
   one.

   If the WebSocket establishment fails with both the first and second
   servers, WebSocket clients would then try the third server (as the
   priority value in its respective DNS SRV resource record is lower).

5.2.  Reusing TCP Connection

   In this case a server resolving to www.example.org is used for both
   HTTP and WebSocket traffic, while a second server resolving to
   ws2.example.com is used for balancing the WebSocket traffic.



   $ORIGIN example.org.
   @         SOA   dns.example.org. root.example.org.
   (2011040501 3600 3600 604800 86400)
   NS        dns.example.org.
   _ws._tcp  SRV   0 1 80 www.example.org.
   _ws._tcp  SRV   0 1 80 ws2.example.org.

   dns       A     1.1.1.100
   www       A     1.1.1.1
   ws2       A     1.1.1.2


   The client (presumably a web browser) would open one or more TCP
   connections with www.example.org and port 80 for the usual HTTP
   communication.  As the retrieved data contains a WebSocket URI
   "ws://example.org/myservice" the client would also initialize a
   WebSocket communication so would perform steps in Section 4.

   Such DNS resolution would return two DNS SRV resource records (the
   first one with www.example.org as domain target and the second one
   with ws2.example.org as domain target), both of them with same
   priority and weight attributes.

   As per target selection rules in [RFC2782] it is expected that half
   of the clients would choose www.example.org domain target and port 80
   as the WebSocket communication address so they MAY reuse an existing
   TCP connection previously opened rather than creating a new one.

6.  Security Considerations

   Any Internet protocol offering DNS SRV resource records for locating
   servers is sensitive to security issues described in
   [I-D.barnes-hard-problem].  Usage of DNS security extensions (DNSSEC)
   as described in [RFC4033] is recommended to mitigate the problem.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers two new SRV Service Labels:

   ws:   MUST be used when constructing a DNS SRV query to locate the
         WebSocket service address (for regular WebSocket connections).

   wss:  MUST be used when constructing a DNS SRV query to locate the
         WebSocket service address (for WebSocket connections tunneled
         over TLS [RFC5246]).

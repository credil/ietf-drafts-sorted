    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        Web-based protocols often require the discovery of host policy or metadata, where "host" is
        not a single resource but the entity controlling the collection of resources identified by
        Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) with a common URI host <xref target='RFC3986'/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        While web protocols have a wide range of metadata needs, they often use metadata that is
        concise, has simple syntax requirements, and can benefit from storing their metadata in a
        common location used by other related protocols.
      </t>
      <t>
        Because there is no URI or representation available to describe a host, many of the methods
        used for associating per-resource metadata (such as HTTP headers) are not available. This
        often leads to the overloading of the root HTTP resource (e.g. 'http://example.com/') with
        host metadata that is not specific or relevant to the root resource itself.
      </t>
      <t>
        This memo registers the well-known URI suffix <spanx style='verb'>host-meta</spanx> in
        the Well-Known URI Registry established by <xref target='RFC5785' />, and specifies a
        simple, general-purpose metadata document format for hosts, to be used by multiple
        web-based protocols.
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition, there are times when a host-wide scope for policy or metadata is too
        coarse-grained. host-meta provides two mechanisms for providing resource-specific
        information:

        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Link Templates - links using a URI template instead of a fixed target URI, providing a
            way to define generic rules for generating resource-specific links by applying the
            individual resource URI to the template.
          </t>
          <t>
            Link-based Resource Descriptor Documents (LRDD, pronounced 'lard') - descriptor
            documents providing resource-specific information, typically information that cannot be
            expressed using link templates. LRDD documents are linked to resources or host-meta
            documents using link templates with the <spanx style='verb'>lrdd</spanx> relation type.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

          resource-specific information for the 'example.com' host:

            Note that the order of links matters and is based on their original order in the
            host-meta and LRDD documents. For example, the <spanx style='verb'>hub</spanx> link
            obtained from the host-meta link template has a higher priority than the link found in
            the LRDD document because the host-meta link appears before the
            <spanx style='verb'>lrdd</spanx> link.
          </t>
          <t>
            On the other hand, the <spanx style='verb'>author</spanx> link found in the LRDD document
            has a higher priority than the link found in the host-meta document because it appears
            after the <spanx style='verb'>lrdd</spanx> link.

    <section title='Obtaining host-meta Documents'>
      <t>
        The client obtains the host-meta document for a given host by sending an HTTP
        <xref target='RFC2616' /> or an HTTPS <xref target='RFC2818' /> GET request to the host for
        the <spanx style='verb'>/.well-known/host-meta</spanx> path. The client MUST only use the
        default ports defined for each protocol (e.g. port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS). The
        scope and meaning of host-meta documents obtained via other protocols or ports is
        undefined.
      </t>
      <t>
        The server MUST support at least one protocol but MAY support both. If both protocols are
        supported, they MUST produce the same document.
      </t>
      <t>
        The decision which protocol is used to obtain the host-meta document have significant
        security ramifications as described in <xref target='security' />.
      </t>
      <figure>
        <preamble>
          For example, the following request is used to obtain the host-meta document for the
          'example.com' host:
        </preamble>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[
  GET /.well-known/host-meta HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        If the server response indicates that the host-meta resource is located elsewhere (a 301,
        302, or 307 response status code), the client MUST try to obtain the resource from the
        location provided in the response. This means that the host-meta document for one host
        MAY be retrieved from another host. Likewise, if the resource is not available or does
        not exist (e.g. a 404 or 410 response status codes) using both the HTTP and HTTPS
        protocols, the client should infer that metadata is not available via this mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        The host-meta document SHOULD be served with the <spanx style='verb'>application/xrd+xml</spanx>
        media type. [[ media type registration pending ]]
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='The host-meta Document Format'>
      <t>
        The host-meta document uses the XRD 1.0 document format as defined by
        <xref target='OASIS.XRD-1.0' />, which provides a simple and extensible XML-based schema
        for describing resources. This memo defines additional processing rules needed to describe
        hosts. Documents MAY include any XRD element not explicitly excluded.
      </t>
      <t>
        The host-meta document root MUST be an <spanx style='verb'>XRD</spanx> element. The
        document SHOULD NOT include a <spanx style='verb'>Subject</spanx> element, as at this time
        no URI is available to identify hosts. The use of the <spanx style='verb'>Alias</spanx>
        element in host-meta is undefined and NOT RECOMMENDED.
      </t>
      <t>
        The subject (or "context resource" as defined by <xref target='RFC5988' />)
        of the XRD <spanx style='verb'>Property</spanx> and <spanx style='verb'>Link</spanx>
        elements is the host described by the host-meta document. However, the subject of
        <spanx style='verb'>Link</spanx> elements with a <spanx style='verb'>template</spanx>
        attribute is the individual resource whose URI is applied to the link template as described
        in <xref target='Link element' />.
      </t>

      <section title="The 'Link' Element" anchor='Link element'>
        <t>
          The XRD <spanx style='verb'>Link</spanx> element, when used with the
          <spanx style='verb'>href</spanx> attribute, conveys a link relation between the host
          described by the document and a common target URI.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the following link declares a common copyright license for the entire

        <t>
          However, a <spanx style='verb'>Link</spanx> element with a
          <spanx style='verb'>template</spanx> attribute conveys a relation whose context is an
          individual resource within the host-meta document scope, and whose target is constructed
          by applying the context resource URI to the template. The template string MAY contain a URI
          string without any variables to represent a resource-level relation that is identical for
          every individual resource.

            For example, a blog with multiple authors can provide information about each article's
            author by providing an endpoint with a parameter set to the URI of each article. Each
            article has a unique author, but all share the same pattern of where that information
            is located:

        <section title='Template Syntax' anchor='template_syntax'>
          <t>
            This memo defines a simple template syntax for URI transformation. A template is a
            string containing brace-enclosed ("{}") variable names marking the parts of the string
            that are to be substituted by the corresponding variable values.
          </t>
          <t>
            Before substituting template variables, values MUST be encoded using UTF-8 and any
            character other than unreserved (as defined by <xref target='RFC3986' />) MUST be
            percent-encoded per <xref target='RFC3986' />.
          </t>
          <t>
            This memo defines a single variable - <spanx style='verb'>uri</spanx> - as the entire
            context resource URI. Protocols MAY define additional relation-specific variables and
            syntax rules, but SHOULD only do so for protocol-specific relation types, and MUST NOT
            change the meaning of the <spanx style='verb'>uri</spanx> variable. If a client is
            unable to successfully process a template (e.g. unknown variable names, unknown or
            incompatible syntax) the parent <spanx style='verb'>Link</spanx> element SHOULD be
            ignored.

    <section title='Processing host-meta Documents'>
      <t>
        Once the host-meta document has been obtained, the client processes its content based on
        the type of information desired: host-wide or resource-specific.
      </t>
      <t>
        Clients usually look for a link with a specific relation type or other attributes. In
        such cases, the client does not need to process the entire host-meta document and all
        linked LRDD documents, but instead, process the various documents in their prescribed order
        until the desired information is found.
      </t>
      <t>
        Protocols using host-meta must indicate whether the information they seek is host-wide or
        resource-specific. For example, "obtain the first host-meta resource-specific link using
        the 'author' relation type". If both types are used for the same purpose (e.g. first look
        for resource-specific, then look for host-wide), the protocol must specify the processing
        order.
      </t>

      <section title='Host-Wide Information'>
        <t>
          When looking for host-wide information, the client MUST ignore any
          <spanx style='verb'>Link</spanx> elements with a <spanx style='verb'>template</spanx>
          attribute, as well as any link using the <spanx style='verb'>lrdd</spanx> relation type.
          All other elements are scoped as host-wide.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Resource-Specific Information'>
        <t>
          Unlike host-wide information which is contained solely within the host-meta document,
          resource-specific information is obtained from host-meta link templates, as well as from
          linked LRDD documents.
        </t>
        <t>
          When looking for resource-specific information, the client constructs a resource
          descriptor by collecting and processing all the host-meta link templates. For each link
          template:

          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>
              The client applies the URI of the desired resource to the template, producing a
              resource-specific link.
            </t>
            <t>
              If the link's relation type is other than <spanx style='verb'>lrdd</spanx>, the
              client adds the link to the resource descriptor in order.

                  The client obtains the LRDD document by following the scheme-specific rules
                  for the LRDD document URI. If the document URI scheme is
                  <spanx style='verb'>http</spanx> or <spanx style='verb'>https</spanx>, the
                  document is obtained via an HTTP <spanx style='verb'>GET</spanx> request to
                  the identified URI. If the HTTP response status code is 301, 302, or 307, the
                  client MUST follow the redirection response and repeat the request with the
                  provided location.

                  The client adds any links found in the LRDD document to the resource

                  <spanx style='verb'>lrdd</spanx> relation type (processing is limited to a single
                  level of inclusion). When adding links, the client
                  SHOULD retain any extension attributes and child elements if present (e.g.
                  &lt;Property&gt; or &lt;Title&gt; elements).

                  elements of the LRDD document &lt;XRD&gt; root element).

      <t>
        The host-meta document is designed to be used by other applications explicitly "opting-in"
        to use the facility. Therefore, any such application MUST review the specific security
        implications of using host-meta documents. By itself, this specification does not provide
        any protections or guarantees that any given host-meta document is under the control of the
        appropriate entity as required by each application.
      </t>
      <t>
        The metadata returned by the host-meta resource is presumed to be under the control of the
        appropriate authority and representative of all the resources described by it. If this
        resource is compromised or otherwise under the control of another party, it may represent a
        risk to the security of the server and data served by it, depending on the applications
        using it.
      </t>
      <t>
        Applications utilizing the host-meta document for sensitive or security related information
        MUST require the use of the HTTPS protocol and MUST NOT produce a host-meta document using
        other means. In addition, such applications MUST require that any redirection leading to
        the retrieval of a host-meta document also utilize the HTTPS protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since the host-meta document is authoritative for the entire host, not just the authority
        (combination of scheme, host, and port) of the host-meta document server, applications MUST
        ensure that using a host-meta document for another URI authority does not represent a
        potential security exploit.
      </t>
      <t>
        Protocols using host-meta templates must evaluate the construction of their templates as
        well as any protocol-specific variables or syntax to ensure that the templates cannot be
        abused by an attacker. For example, a client can be tricked into following a malicious link
        due to a poorly constructed template which produces unexpected results when its variable
        values contain unexpected characters.

            <t hangText='Description:'>
              <spanx style='verb'>lrdd</spanx> (pronounced 'lard') is an acronym for Link-based
              Resource Descriptor Document. It is used by the host-meta document processor to
              locate resource-specific information about individual resources. When used elsewhere
              (e.g. in HTTP <spanx style='verb'>Link</spanx> header fields or in HTML &lt;LINK&gt;
              elements), it operates as an include directive, identifying the location of
              additional links and other metadata. Multiple links with the 'lrdd' relation indicate
              multiple sources to include, not alternative sources of the same information. An
              <spanx style='verb'>application/xrd+xml</spanx> representation MUST be available, and
              this media type MAY appear in a link's <spanx style='verb'>type</spanx> attribute.
              Additional representations MAY be available (using the HTTP
              <spanx style='verb'>Accept</spanx> request header field), in which case the link's
              <spanx style='verb'>type</spanx> attribute SHOULD be omitted.

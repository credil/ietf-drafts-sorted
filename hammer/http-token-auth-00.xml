      <t>
        [[ This draft is submitted for the consideration of the OAuth Working Group to be adopted as
        an official working group item per its current charter. It is presented in its raw form to
        assist in facilitating a more effective working group conversation and should not be
        considered a complete proposal. Please discuss this draft on the
        <eref target="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/oauth">oauth@ietf.org</eref> mailing
        list. ]]
      </t>
      <t>
        With the growing use of distributed web services and cloud computing, clients need to allow
        other parties access to the resources they control. When granting access, clients should
        not be required to share their credentials (typically a username and password), and should
        have the ability to restrict access to a limited subset of the resources they control or
        the access methods supported by these resources. These goals require new classes of
        authentication credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
        The HTTP Basic and Digest Access authentication schemes defined by <xref target="RFC2617" />,
        enable clients to make authenticated HTTP requests by using a username (or userid) and
        a password. In most cases, the client uses a single set of credentials to access all the
        resources it controls which are hosted by the server.
      </t>
      <t>
        While the Basic and Digest schemes can be used to send credentials other than a username
        and password, their wide deployment and well-established behavior in user-agents preclude
        them from being used with other classes of credentials. Extending these schemes to support
        new classes would require impractical changes to their existing deployment.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Token Access Authentication scheme provides a method for making authenticated HTTP
        requests using a token - an identifier used to denote an access grant with specific scope,
        duration, cryptographic properties, and other attributes. Tokens can issued by the server,
        self-issued by the client, or issued by a third party.
      </t>
      <t>
        The token scheme support an extensible set of credential classes, by enabling the server to
        declare the classes it supports. Token classes determine how tokens are obtained and the
        context in which they can be used. It also supports an extensible set of authentication
        methods and authentication coverage (the elements of the HTTP request such as the request
        URI or entity-body included in the authentication process).
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines four token authentication methods to support the most common use
        cases and describes their security properties. The methods through which clients obtain
        tokens supporting these methods are beyond the scope of this specification. The OAuth
        protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-web-delegation" /> defines one such set of methods
        for obtaining <spanx style="oauth">oauth</spanx>-class token credentials.

    <section title="Making Requests" anchor="requests">
      <t>
        The client makes authenticated requests by calculating the values of a set of attributes
        and adding them to the HTTP request using the <xref target="authz_header">Authorization header field</xref>.
        Authenticated request can be sent either directly (without first receiving a challenge), or
        in response to an authentication challenge.
      </t>
      <t>
        To make an authenticated request, the client obtains information about the attributes
        supported by the server. This information is provided by the server via the
        <xref target="authn_header">WWW-Authenticate header field</xref>. The client SHOULD only send an
        authenticated request to the server (without first receiving a challenge) if it has prior
        knowledge of the attributes supported by server.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client chooses an available token with the supported class and authentication method.
        It also chooses a supported authentication coverage. The methods through which the client
        obtains a valid token, or the criteria used to choose a token if more than one is available
        are beyond the scope of this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        Once the client selects the appropriate token credentials it proceeds to:
        
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            Assign values based on its selection to the following attributes:
            
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                <spanx style="verb">token</spanx>
              </t>
              <t>
                <spanx style="verb">class</spanx>
              </t>
              <t>
                <spanx style="verb">method</spanx>
              </t>
              <t>
                <spanx style="verb">coverage</spanx>
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            If the client uses a coverage method other than <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> it
            MUST assign values to the following attributes:

            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx>
              </t>
              <t>
                <spanx style="verb">timestamp</spanx>
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            Assigns value to any additional class-specific, method-specific, or coverage-specific
            attributes as defined by protocol extensions.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the client uses a coverage method other than <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> it
            constructs the normalized request string based on the selected coverage as described in
            <xref target="coverage" />.
          </t>
          <t>
            Calculates the value of the <spanx style="verb">auth</spanx> attribute as defined by
            the selected authentication method.
          </t>
          <t>
            Adds the assigned attributes to the request via the
            <xref target="authz_header">Authorization header field</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            Sends the authenticated HTTP request to the server.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Verifying Requests" anchor="verify_request">
      <t>
        A servers receiving an authenticated request validates it by performing the following
        REQUIRED steps:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            Verify that the token used by the client as well as the coverage method matches the
            server's requirements.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the client used a coverage method other than <spanx style="verb">none</spanx>,
            construct the normalized request string based on the selected coverage as described in
            <xref target="coverage" />.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the client used an authentication method other than <spanx style="verb">none</spanx>,
            recalculate the value of the <spanx style="verb">auth</spanx> attribute as described in
            <xref target="methods" /> and compare it to the value received from the client via
            the <spanx style="verb">auth</spanx> attribute.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the client used a coverage method other than <spanx style="verb">none</spanx>,
            ensure that the combination of nonce, timestamp, and token received from the client has
            not been used before in a previous request (the server MAY reject requests with stale
            timestamps; the determination of staleness is left up to the server to define).
          </t>
          <t>
            Verify the scope and status of the client credentials as represented by the token.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        If the request fails verification, the server SHOULD respond with an HTTP 401 (unauthorized)
        status code, and SHOULD include a token scheme authentication challenge using the
        <xref target="error_header">WWW-Authenticate header field</xref>. The server MAY include
        further details about why the request was rejected using the
        <xref target="error_header">Authorization-Error header field</xref>.

    <section title="The WWW-Authenticate Response Header" anchor="authn_header">
      <t>
        A server receiving a request for a protected resource without a valid
        <xref target="authz_header">Authorization header field</xref> MUST respond with a 401

				In order for the server to verify the authenticity of the request and prevent unauthorized
        access, the client must prove it is the rightful owner of the credentials. This is
        accomplished using the authentication method associated with the token.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification provides three methods for the client to prove its rightful ownership of
        the credentials: <spanx style="verb">hmac-sha-1</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">hmac-sha-256</spanx>,
        and <spanx style="verb">rsassa-pkcs1-v1.5-sha-256</spanx>. In addition, the
        <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> method is defined to allow the use of bearer token which
        does not utilizes any cryptographic means.
      </t>
      <t>
        The authentication process does not change the request or its parameters, with the exception
        of the <spanx style="verb">auth</spanx> attribute.
      </t>

      <section title="The 'none' Method">
        <t>
          The <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> method does not employ a cryptographic algorithm
          and does not provide any security on its own. Servers utilizing this method use the token
          identifier as a bearer token, relying solely on the value of the token identifier to
          authenticate the client.
        </t>
        <t>
          The <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">timestamp</spanx>, and
          <spanx style="verb">auth</spanx> attributes are not used, and SHOULD NOT be included in
          authenticated requests. The <spanx style="verb">coverage</spanx> attribute MUST be set to
          <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> but MAY be omitted from the request. Nevertheless, these

        The normalized request string is a consistent, reproducible concatenation of several
        of the HTTP request elements into a single string. The string is used as an input to

      <section title="The 'base' Method">
        <t>
          When using the <spanx style="verb">base</spanx> method, the normalized request string
          includes the following components of the HTTP request:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              The HTTP request method (e.g. <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx>,
              <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>, etc.).
            </t>
            <t>
              The authority as declared by the HTTP <spanx style="verb">Host</spanx> request
              header.
            </t>

        <t>
          The <spanx style="verb">base</spanx> normalized request string does not cover the entire

          The <spanx style="verb">base+body-hmac-sha-256</spanx> method added the request entity-body

        </t>
        <t>

              Before constructing the string, the entity-body hash is calculated by applying the

            </t>
            <t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">
      <t>
        As stated in <xref target="RFC2617" />, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not
        in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use. Implementers
        are strongly encouraged to assess how this protocol addresses their security requirements.
      </t>

      <section title="Credentials Transmission">
        <t>
          This specification does not describe any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting raw
          tokens credentials. Methods used to obtain tokens should ensure that these transmissions
          are protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS or SSL.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Confidentiality of Requests">
        <t>
          While this protocol provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of requests, it
          provides no guarantee of request confidentiality. Unless further precautions are taken,
          eavesdroppers will have full access to request content. Servers should carefully consider
          the kinds of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and should employ
          transport-layer security mechanisms to protect sensitive resources.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers">
        <t>
          This protocol makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the server. A hostile party
          could take advantage of this by intercepting the client's requests and returning
          misleading or otherwise incorrect responses. Service providers should consider such
          attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should require transport-layer
          security for any requests where the authenticity of the server or of request responses is
          an issue.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Plaintext Storage of Credentials">
        <t>
          When used with a symmetric shared-secret authentication method, the token shared-secret
          function the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems. In order to
          compute the signatures used in methods, the server must have access to these secrets in
          plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems, which
          store only a one-way hash of user credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          If an attacker were to gain access to these secrets - or worse, to the server's database
          of all such secrets - he or she would be able to perform any action on behalf of any
          resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these secrets from
          unauthorized access.
        </t>

      <section title="Scoping of Access Requests">
        <t>
          By itself, this protocol does not provide any method for scoping the access rights
          granted to a client. However, most applications do require greater granularity of access
          rights. For example, servers may wish to make it possible to grant access to some
          protected resources but not others, or to grant only limited access (such as read-only
          access) to those protected resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          When implementing this protocol, servers should consider the types of access resource
          owners may wish to grant clients, and should provide mechanisms to do so. Servers should
          also take care to ensure that resource owners understand the access they are granting, as
          well as any risks that may be involved.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Entropy of Secrets">
        <t>
          Unless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access
          to authenticated requests and signatures, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force
          attacks to recover the credentials used. Servers should be careful to assign
          shared-secrets which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at
          least the length of time that the shared-secrets are valid.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, if shared-secrets are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is
          not possible to mount a brute force attack that recovers the shared-secret in less than
          two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the longest
          secrets reasonable.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate
          these secrets be of sufficiently high quality. Many PRNG implementations generate number
          sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit patterns or other
          weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be
          careful to use cryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.

      <section title="Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion Attacks">
        <t>
          This specification includes a number of features which may make resource exhaustion
          attacks against servers possible. For example, this protocol requires servers to track
          used nonces. If an attacker is able to use many nonces quickly, the resources required to
          track them may exhaust available capacity. And again, this protocol can require servers
          to perform potentially expensive computations in order to verify the signature on
          incoming requests. An attacker may exploit this to perform a denial of service attack by
          sending a large number of invalid requests to the server.
        </t>
        <t>
          Resource Exhaustion attacks are by no means specific to this specification. However,
          implementers should be careful to consider the additional avenues of attack that this
          protocol exposes, and design their implementations accordingly. For example, entropy
          starvation typically results in either a complete denial of service while the system
          waits for new entropy or else in weak (easily guessable) secrets. When implementing this
          protocol, servers should consider which of these presents a more serious risk for their
          application and design accordingly.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Coverage Limitations">
        <t>
          The normalized request string has been designed to support the authentication methods
          defined in this specification. Those designing additional methods, should evaluated the
          compatibility of the normalized request string with their security requirements.
          Since the normalized request string does not cover the entire HTTP request, servers
          should employ additional mechanisms to protect such elements.

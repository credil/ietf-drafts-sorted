             LRDD: Link-based Resource Descriptor Discovery
                       draft-hammer-discovery-06

Abstract

   LRDD (pronounced 'lard') provides a process for obtaining information
   about a resource identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
   The 'information about a resource' - a resource descriptor - provides
   machine-readable information that aims to increase interoperability
   and enhance interactions with the resource.  LRDD provides a narrow
   and well-defined set of rules for obtaining and processing link-based
   descriptors (found in multiple sources such as HTTP headers, document
   markup, and resource descriptors) which are often required for
   security and consistent client behavior.

1.  Specification Status

   This specification was retired in favor of a single, simpler
   document.  Some of the functionality was retained merged into
   [I-D.hammer-hostmeta] where future work is done.


2.  Introduction

   LRDD defines a simple process for locating resource descriptors for
   URI-identified resources.  Resource descriptors are machine-readable
   documents that provide information about resources (resource
   metadata) for the purposes of promoting interoperability and
   assisting in interacting with unknown resources that support known
   interfaces.

   For example, a web page about an upcoming meeting can provide in its
   descriptor the location of the meeting organizer's free/busy
   information to potentially negotiate a different time.  A social
   network profile page descriptor can identify the location of the
   user's address book as well as accounts on other sites.  A web
   service implementing an API with optional components can advertise
   which of these are supported.

   Given the wide range of metadata needs, no single descriptor format
   or retrieval method can adequately accommodate every use case.  While
   there are many methods for obtaining resource descriptors (e.g.,
   links, HTTP headers, WebDAV's PROPFIND [RFC4918], HTTP OPTIONS,
   URIQA's MGET [URIQA]), LRDD utilizes the Web Linking framework
   defined in [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header].  LRDD defines a narrow
   profile of Web Linking for obtaining and processing link-based
   descriptors to accommodate the common discovery needs of many Web
   protocols.

   In LRDD, the resource descriptor is not a single document but the
   aggregation of links obtained from three link sources (when
   applicable and available).  The resource descriptor is constructed by
   determining the order in which to process the three link sources and
   aggregating the links and metadata contained in each source:

   o  host-meta document - links generated by applying the resource URI
      to the link templates provided by the host's host-meta document as
      defined in [I-D.hammer-hostmeta].

   o  HTTP response header - links included in the HTTP response header
      to an HTTP [RFC2616] "HEAD" or "GET" resource representation
      request using the "Link" header field defined in
      [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header].

Internet-Draft                    LRDD                          May 2010


   o  Document markup - links included in the resource representation
      markup using the <LINK> element.

   The resource descriptor also includes additional links and metadata
   obtained from LRDD documents - XRD [OASIS.XRD-1.0] documents linked
   to from one of the same three sources using the "lrdd" relation type.

   The client usually looks for a link with a specific relation type or
   other metadata.  In such cases, the client does not need to construct
   the entire resource descriptor, but instead, process the various
   sources in their prescribed order until the desired information is
   found.  While the process described in Section 4 is meant to
   construct the entire resource descriptor, the client MAY stop
   processing as soon as it finds the desired information.

2.1.  Example

   In this example, an article published by a website allows readers to
   post comments and provide the web address of their own blog.  The
   article page includes an avatar (a photo of the reader) when
   displaying comments.  The photo is obtained by performing discovery
   on the web address provided by the reader, if supported by the
   reader's blog.

   After receiving a comment from Jane which has her own blog at
   "http://jane.example.com/blog", the website performs LRDD discovery
   to try and obtain Jane's photo.

   First, the website determines the source priority order - the order
   in which it looks for links in the various sources - for Jane's blog
   by fetching its host-meta document from
   "https://jane.example.com/.well-known/host-meta":


   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
   <XRD xmlns='http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'
        xmlns:hm='http://host-meta.net/ns/1.0'>

       <hm:Host>jane.example.com</hm:Host>
       <Property type='http://lrdd.net/priority/resource' />

       <Link rel='lrdd' template='http://jane.example.com?lrdd={uri}' />
       <Link rel='contents' template='http://example.com?c={uri}' />
   </XRD>


   which indicates the blog is using Resource-priority (giving higher
   priority to links provided by the resource itself over those defined



Hammer-Lahav            Expires November 29, 2010               [Page 4]

   by the global host policy).  Since Jane's blog uses Resource-
   priority, the website looks for "avatar" type links in this order:
   <LINK> elements in the blog document's markup, HTTP Link headers in
   the blog document HTTP response, and last in the host-meta document
   using link templates.  Note that the "avatar" relation type is used
   for illustration purposes only and at this time is not a registered
   relation type.

                                 Figure 1

   To obtain a markup representation of Jane's blog, the website makes
   an HTTP "GET" request to "http://jane.example.com/blog":


    GET /blog HTTP/1.1
    Host: jane.example.com
    Accept: text/html


   And receives back (HTML schema simplified for display purposes):


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    Link: <http://jane.example.com/author>; rel='author'

    <HTML>
      <HEAD>
        <LINK href='http://jane.example.com/image' rel='avatar' />
      </HEAD>
      <BODY>
        <H1>Jane's Blog</H1>
      </BODY>
    </HTML>


   The document's HTML markup includes the desired link.  The website
   can fetch Jane's photo from "http://jane.example.com/image".

   After obtaining Jane's photo, the website looks for a short
   description of Jane to include with her comment.  It performs another
   LRDD discovery, this time looking for an "author" link.

   Repeating the same process, the website looks for qualified <LINK>
   elements in Jane's blog HTML markup and finds none.  It then looks
   for a LRDD document - a descriptor document containing additional
   information about the resource - which uses the "lrdd" link relation.
   It finds none in the HTML document.

   In Resource-priority, the next source is the HTTP header included in
   the resource representation response.  The HTTP header (shown above
   with the HTML response) includes a qualified link to Jane's author
   page.


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    Link: <http://jane.example.com/author>; rel='author'


   Before the website can display Jane's photo and description, it needs
   to find the copyright license used by Jane's blog.  It performs
   another LRDD discovery looking for a link with a "copyright" relation
   type.  It fails to find such link in the HTML markup as well as a
   markup link to a LRDD document.  It tries and fails to find a
   "copyright" link in the HTTP response header or a link to a LRDD
   document.

   After exhausting the first two sources, the website proceeds to the
   host-meta source (Figure 1), and looks for link templates.  It fails
   to find a link to a copyright statement, but it does find a link to a
   LRDD document:


     <Link rel='lrdd' template='http://jane.example.com?lrdd={uri}' />


   The website obtains the LRDD document for Jane's blog by applying the
   blog's URI to the template:


    http://jane.example.com?lrdd=http%3A%2F%2Fjane.example.com%2Fblog


   and obtains the LRDD document for Jane's blog:


   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
   <XRD xmlns='http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'>

       <Subject>http://jane.example.com/blog</Subject>
       <Property type='http://example.com/version'>2.0</Property>

       <Link rel='copyright' href='http://jane.example.com/copyright' />
   </XRD>

   The LRDD document provided by the host-meta link template includes a
   link to the copyright statement.  The website now has all the
   information it needs to display Jane's comment along with her photo
   and description on the article page.

2.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Link Source Priority Order

   The client MUST first determine the host source priority order.  To
   ensure consistent client behavior and to enable hosts to set their
   own security policy with regard to metadata authority, LRDD provides
   two processing profiles:

   o  Host priority - priority is given to links set by the host policy
      (via host-meta and HTTP response headers) over those set by each
      individual resources (via the document markup).  The client MUST
      process the three sources in the following order: host-meta
      document, HTTP response header, and document markup.

   o  Resource priority - priority is given to the individual resource
      over the policies of the host.  The client MUST process the three
      sources in the following order: document markup, HTTP response
      header, and host-meta document.

   Host priority is the default source priority order.  Hosts that wish
   to use resource priority MUST declare it by setting the LRDD priority
   property in their host-meta document:
   "http://lrdd.net/priority/resource".  The priority property element
   does not have a value.

   For example:


     <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
     <XRD xmlns='http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'
           xmlns:hm='http://host-meta.net/ns/1.0'>

         <hm:Host>example.com</hm:Host>
         <Property type='http://lrdd.net/priority/resource' />
     </XRD>

4.  Resource Descriptor Construction

   To construct the resource descriptor, the client determines the
   source priority order as described in Section 3, and processes each
   of the three sources (Section 5) as follows:

   1.  Obtain and processes the source to produce an ordered list of
       links as described for each source in Section 5.

   2.  Add any link found to the resource descriptor links list in
       order, except for any link using the "lrdd" relation type.

   3.  For each link using the "lrdd" relation type and
       "application/xrd+xml" media type (if present):

       A.  Obtain the LRDD document by following the scheme-specific
           rules for the LRDD document URI.  If the document URI scheme
           is "http" or "https", the document is obtained via an HTTP
           "GET" request to the identified URI.  If the HTTP response
           status code is 301, 302, or 307, the client MUST follow the
           redirection response and repeat the request with the provided
           location.  If a redirection response results in another 301,
           302, or 307 response, the client SHOULD repeat the request
           with the provided location as many times as reasonable,
           making sure not to enter into a loop if a location URI
           repeats itself.  The client MUST only process the document if
           it was received with an HTTP 200 (OK) status code and is a
           valid XRD document per [OASIS.XRD-1.0].

       B.  Add any link found in the LRDD document to the resource
           descriptor links list in order, except for any link using the
           "lrdd" relation type.  When adding links, the client SHOULD
           retain any extension attributes and child elements if present
           (e.g. <Property> or <Title> elements).

       C.  Add any resource properties found in the LRDD document to the
           resource descriptor metadata list in order (e.g. <Alias< or
           <Property> child elements of the <XRD> root element).

   For example, the resource descriptor of Jane's blog as described in
   Section 2.1 and expressed as an XRD document (for illustration
   purposes only) is:


  <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
  <XRD xmlns='http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'>

    <Subject>http://jane.example.com/blog</Subject>
    <Property type='http://example.com/version'>2.0</Property>

    <Link rel='avatar' href='http://jane.example.com/image' />
    <Link rel='author' href='http://jane.example.com/author' />
    <Link rel='contents'
     href='http://example.com?c=http%3A%2F%2Fjane.example.com%2Fblog' />
    <Link rel='copyright' href='http://jane.example.com/copyright' />
  </XRD>


   Using the same example, if Jane's host-meta used host priority
   instead of resource priority, the resource descriptor of Jane's blog
   would be:


  <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
  <XRD xmlns='http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'>

    <Subject>http://jane.example.com/blog</Subject>
    <Property type='http://example.com/version'>2.0</Property>

    <Link rel='contents'
     href='http://example.com?c=http%3A%2F%2Fjane.example.com%2Fblog' />
    <Link rel='copyright' href='http://jane.example.com/copyright' />
    <Link rel='author' href='http://jane.example.com/author' />
    <Link rel='avatar' href='http://jane.example.com/image' />
  </XRD>



5.  Link Sources

   Each of the link sources supported by LRDD presents a different set
   of requirements and benefits.  The criteria used to determine which
   sources a server supports are based on a combination of factors:

   o  The ability to offer and obtain a representation of the resource
      by dereferencing its URI.




Hammer-Lahav            Expires November 29, 2010               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                    LRDD                          May 2010


   o  The availability of a markup document representation supporting
      <LINK> elements compatible with [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header].

   o  The availability of an HTTP representation of the resource and the
      ability to provide and access link information in its response
      header.

   o  The ability to offer and process a host-meta document.

5.1.  host-meta Document

   The host-meta document source is available for any resource
   identified by a URI with an authority that supports the host-meta
   document as defined in [I-D.hammer-hostmeta].  This method does not
   require obtaining any representation of the resource, and operates
   solely using the resource URI.

   Links between the resource URI and other resources are expressed
   using link templates as defined by [I-D.hammer-hostmeta] section 3.2.
   By applying the host-wide templates to an individual resource URI, a
   resource-specific link is generated which can be used to express
   links without the need to access or provide a representation for the
   resource.

   The client processes the host-meta document, searches for link
   templates and applies the resource URI to produce a set of links.
   The client MUST retain the order of links as present in the host-meta
   document.  Any links contained in the host-meta document not using
   the "template" attribute MUST be ignored and excluded from the
   resource descriptor (they are still valid for other purposes).

   For example, the resource URI "http://example.com/x" and the
   following host-meta link template:


     <Link rel='author' template='http://example.com?author={uri}' />


   generate an "author" link between "http://example.com/x" and
   "http://example.com?author=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fx".

5.2.  HTTP Response Headers

   The HTTP response header source is limited to resources for which an
   HTTP "GET" or "HEAD" request returns a valid representation of the
   resource.  This source uses the "Link" header field defined in
   [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header] and requires the retrieval of a
   resource representation header.

Internet-Draft                    LRDD                          May 2010


   For example:


   Link: <http://example.com?author=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fx>;
             rel='author'


   The client obtains the HTTP response header links by making an HTTP
   (or HTTPS) "GET" or "HEAD" request to the resource URI.

   If the HTTP response status code is 301, 302, or 307, the client MUST
   follow the redirection response and repeat the request with the
   provided location.  If a redirection response results in another 301,
   302, or 307 response, the client SHOULD repeat the request with the
   provided location as many times as reasonable, making sure not to
   enter into a loop if a location URI repeats itself.

   The client MUST only process the header if the HTTP response includes
   a 200, 204, 206, or 304 status code.  The client processes the
   response header and searches for "Link" header fields.  The client
   MUST retain the order of links as present in the response header.

   Link headers can include multiple relation types in a single "rel"
   attribute (for example "rel="license copyright"").  The client MUST
   properly process such multiple relation types "rel" attributes as
   defined by [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header].

5.3.  Document Markup

   The document markup source is limited to resources with an available
   markup representation that supports typed relations using the <LINK>
   element, such as HTML [W3C.REC-html401-19991224], XHTML
   [W3C.REC-xhtml1-20020801], and Atom [RFC4287].  Other markup formats
   are permitted as long as the semantics of their <LINK> elements are
   fully compatible with the link framework defined in
   [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header].

   For example:


   <LINK href='http://example.com?author=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fx'
           rel='author'>


   The client obtains the document markup by retrieving a representation
   of the resource using the applicable transport for that resource URI.
   When using HTTP (or HTTPS), the client obtains the document markup by
   making a "GET" request to the resource URI.

Internet-Draft                    LRDD                          May 2010


   If the HTTP response status code is 301, 302, or 307, the client MUST
   follow the redirection response and repeat the request with the
   provided location.  If a redirection response results in another 301,
   302, or 307 response, the client SHOULD repeat the request with the
   provided location as many times as reasonable, making sure not to
   enter into a loop if a location URI repeats itself.

   The client MUST only process the document markup if the HTTP response
   includes a 200 (OK) status code.  The client processes the document
   markup and searches for "LINK" elements.  The client MUST retain the
   order of links as present in the document markup.

   The client MUST obey the document markup schema and ignore any
   invalid elements (such as <LINK> elements outside the <HEAD> section
   of an HTML document).  This is done to avoid unintentional markup
   from other parts of the document to be used for discovery purposes,
   which can have vast impact on usability and security.

   Some <LINK> elements allow multiple relation types in a single "rel"
   attribute (for example "rel='license copyright'").  The client MUST
   properly process such multiple relation "rel" attributes as defined
   by the format specification.


6.  Security Considerations

   The methods used to perform discovery are not secure, private or
   integrity-guaranteed, and due caution should be exercised when using
   them.  Applications that perform LRDD SHOULD consider the attack
   vectors opened by automatically following, trusting, or otherwise
   using links gathered from document markups, HTTP response headers, or
   host-meta documents.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  The 'lrdd' Relation Type

   This specification registers the "lrdd" relation type in the Link
   Relation Type Registry defined by [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header]:

   Relation Name:  lrdd

   Description:  Identifies a resource descriptor for the link's context
      used by the LRDD protocol.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgments

   Inspiration for this memo derived from previous work on a descriptor
   format called XRDS-Simple, which in turn derived from another
   descriptor format, XRDS.  Previous discovery workflows include Yadis
   which is currently used by the OpenID community.  While suffering
   from significant shortcomings, Yadis was a breakthrough approach to
   performing discovery using extremely restricted hosting environments,
   and this memo has strived to preserve as much of that spirit as
   possible.

   The author wishes to thanks the OASIS XRI TC and WebFinger
   communities for their support, encouragement, and enthusiasm for this
   work.  Special thanks go to Phil Archer, Lisa Dusseault, Joseph
   Holsten, Mark Nottingham, John Panzer, Drummond Reed, and Jonathan
   Rees for their invaluable feedback.


Appendix B.  Document History

   [[ to be removed by the RFC editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   -06

   o  Marked as deprecated with some functionality moved to host-meta.

   -05

   o  Many editorial changes, cleanup.

   o  Changed the processing flow to focus on a aggregation.  Clients
      can always stop when they find what they need.

   o  Clarified redirections and HTTP status codes for valid document
      markups and response headers.

   o  Removed restrictions on multiple LRDD documents.

   -04

   o  Changed focus to a narrow and well-defined discovery process.

   o  Removed analysis appendix and discussion of discovery types and
      removed informative references.

Internet-Draft                    LRDD                          May 2010


   o  Expanded the descriptor definition to include links as well as
      LRDD documents, moving away from the single-document approach.

   o  Moved the Link-Pattern field and template syntax to new host-meta
      draft.

   o  Updated references.

   o  Added example.

   -03

   o  Added protocol name LRDD (pronounced 'lard').

   o  Fixed Link-Pattern examples to include missing semicolons.

   -02

   o  Changed focus from an HTTP-based process to Link-based process.

   o  Completely revised and restructured document for better clarity.

   o  Realigned the methods to produce consistent results and changed
      the way redirections and client-errors are handled.

   o  Updated to use newer version of site-meta, now called host-meta,
      including a new plaintext-based format to replace the previous XML
      format.

   o  Renamed Link-Template to Link-Pattern to avoid future conflict
      with a previously proposed Link-Template HTTP header.

   o  Removed support for the 'scheme' Link-Template parameter.

   o  Replaced restrictions with interoperability recommendations.

   o  Added IANA considerations per new host-meta registry requirements.

   -01

   o  Rename 'resource discovery' to 'descriptor discovery'.

   o  Added informative reference to Metalink.

   o  Clarified that the resource descriptor URI can use any URI scheme,
      not just 'http' or 'https'.

Internet-Draft                    LRDD                          May 2010


   o  Removed comment regarding redirects when using <LINK> Elements.

   o  Clarified that HTTPS must be used with 'https' URIs for both Link
      headers and host-meta retrieval.

   o  Removed DNS verification step for host-meta with schemes other
      then 'http' and 'https'.  Replaced with a general discussion of
      authority and a security consideration comment.

   o  Organized host-meta section into another sub-section level.

   o  Enlarged the template vocabulary from a single 'uri' variable to
      include smaller URI components.

   o  Added informative reference to RFC 2295 in analysis appendix.

   -00

   o  Initial draft.

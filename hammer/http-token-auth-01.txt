Internet-Draft            Token Authentication             February 2010


1.  Introduction

   [[ This draft is submitted for the consideration of the OAuth Working
   Group to be adopted as an official working group item per its current
   charter.  It is presented in its raw form to assist in facilitating a
   more effective working group conversation and should not be
   considered a complete proposal.  Please discuss this draft on the
   oauth@ietf.org [1] mailing list. ]]

   With the growing use of distributed web services and cloud computing,
   clients need to allow other parties access to the resources they
   control.  When granting access, clients should not be required to
   share their credentials (typically a username and password).  Clients
   should also have the ability to restrict access to a limited subset
   of the resources they control or limit access to the methods
   supported by these resources.  These goals require new classes of
   authentication credentials.

   The HTTP Basic and Digest Access authentication schemes defined by
   [RFC2617], enable clients to make authenticated HTTP requests by
   using a username (or userid) and a password.  In most cases, the
   client uses a single set of credentials to access all the resources
   it controls which are hosted by the server.

   While the Basic and Digest schemes can be used to send credentials
   other than a username and password, their wide deployment and well-
   established behavior in user-agents preclude them from being used
   with other classes of credentials.  Extending these schemes to
   support new classes would require an impractical change to their
   existing deployment.

   The Token Access Authentication scheme provides a method for making
   authenticated HTTP requests using a token - an identifier used to
   denote an access grant with specific scope, duration, cryptographic
   properties, and other attributes.  Tokens can issued by the server,
   self-issued by the client, or issued by a third-party.

   The token scheme supports an extensible set of credential classes,
   authentication methods (e.g. cryptographic algorithm), and
   authentication coverage (the elements of the HTTP request - such as
   the request URI or entity-body - covered by the authentication).

   This specification defines four token authentication methods to
   support the most common use cases and describes their security
   properties.  The methods through which clients obtain tokens
   supporting these methods are beyond the scope of this specification.
   The OAuth protocol [I-D.ietf-oauth-web-delegation] defines one such
   set of methods for obtaining token credentials.

Internet-Draft            Token Authentication             February 2010


1.1.  Terminology

   client
         An HTTP client (per [RFC2616]) capable of making Token-
         authenticated requests (Section 2).

   server
         An HTTP server (per [RFC2616]) capable of accepting Token-
         authenticated requests (Section 2).

   protected resource
         An access-restricted resource (per [RFC2616]) hosted by the
         server and accessible by making a Token-authenticated request
         (Section 2).

   token credentials
         A set of a unique identifier (token) and an authentication
         method with an OPTIONAL shared secret (symmetric or
         asymmetric), as well as other attributes (e.g. duration,
         scope), used by the client to make authenticated requests.

   normalized request string
         A string representing various elements of the HTTP request,
         normalized and concatenated together.  The elements included in
         the normalize request string are determined by the
         authentication coverage supported by the server.

1.2.  Example

   The following HTTP request:

     GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com


   returns the following authentication challenge:

     HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
     WWW-Authenticate: Token realm="http://example.com/",
                             coverage="base base+body-sha-256",
                             timestamp="137131190"


   The response means the server is expecting the client to authenticate
   using the token scheme, with a set of token credentials issued for
   the "http://example.com/" realm.  The server supports the "base" and
   "base+body-sha-256" coverage methods which means the client must sign
   the base request components (e.g. host, port, request URI), and may



Hammer-Lahav             Expires August 7, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Token Authentication             February 2010


   also sign the request payload (entity-body).  It also provides its
   current time to assist the client in synchronizing its clock with the
   server's clock for the purpose of producing a unique nonce value
   (used with some of the authentication methods).

   The client has previously obtained a set of token credentials for
   accessing resources in the "http://example.com/" realm.  The
   credentials issued to the client by the server included the following
   attributes:

   token:  h480djs93hd8

   method:  hmac-sha-1

   secret:  489dks293j39

   expiration:  137217600

   The client attempts the HTTP request again, this time using the token
   credentials issued by the server earlier to authenticate.  The client
   uses the "base" coverage method and applies the "hmac-sha-1"
   authentication method as dictated by the token credentials.

     GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     Authorization: Token token="h480djs93hd8",
                          coverage="base",
                          timestamp="137131200",
                          nonce="dj83hs9s",
                          auth="djosJKDKJSD8743243/jdk33klY="


   to which the server respond with the requested resource
   representation after validating the request.

1.3.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging].  Additionally, the following rules
   are included from [RFC2617]: realm, auth-param.

2.  Making Requests

   The client makes authenticated requests by calculating the values of
   a set of attributes and adding them to the HTTP request using the
   Authorization header field (Section 5).  Authenticated request can be
   sent either directly (without first receiving a challenge), or in
   response to an authentication challenge.

   To make an authenticated request, the client obtains information
   about the attributes supported by the server.  This information is
   provided by the server via the WWW-Authenticate header field
   (Section 4).  The client SHOULD only send an authenticated request to
   the server (without first receiving a challenge) if it has prior
   knowledge of the attributes supported by server.

   The client chooses an available token suitable for accessing the
   resource realm as well as a a supported authentication coverage.  The
   methods through which the client obtains a valid token, or the
   criteria used to choose a token if more than one is available are
   beyond the scope of this specification.

   Once the client selects the appropriate token credentials it proceeds
   to:

   1.  Assign values based on its selection to the following attributes:

       *  "token"

       *  "coverage"

   2.  If the client uses a coverage method other than "none" it MUST
       assign values to the following attributes:

       *  "nonce"

       *  "timestamp"

   3.  Assigns value to any additional method-specific, or coverage-
       specific attributes as defined by protocol extensions.

   4.  If the client uses a coverage method other than "none" it
       constructs the normalized request string based on the selected
       coverage as described in Section 8.

   5.  Calculates the value of the "auth" attribute as defined by the
       selected authentication method.

Internet-Draft            Token Authentication             February 2010


   6.  Adds the assigned attributes to the request via the Authorization
       header field (Section 5).

   7.  Sends the authenticated HTTP request to the server.


3.  Verifying Requests

   A servers receiving an authenticated request validates it by
   performing the following REQUIRED steps:

   1.  Verify that the token used by the client as well as the coverage
       method matches the server's requirements.

   2.  If the client used a coverage method other than "none", construct
       the normalized request string based on the selected coverage as
       described in Section 8.

   3.  If the client used an authentication method other than "none",
       recalculate the value of the "auth" attribute as described in
       Section 7 and compare it to the value received from the client
       via the "auth" attribute.

   4.  If the client used a coverage method other than "none", ensure
       that the combination of nonce, timestamp, and token received from
       the client has not been used before in a previous request (the
       server MAY reject requests with stale timestamps; the
       determination of staleness is left up to the server to define).

   5.  Verify the scope and status of the client credentials as
       represented by the token.

   If the request fails verification, the server SHOULD respond with an
   HTTP 401 (unauthorized) status code, and SHOULD include a token
   scheme authentication challenge using the WWW-Authenticate header
   field (Section 6).  The server MAY include further details about why
   the request was rejected using the Authorization-Error header field
   (Section 6).


4.  The WWW-Authenticate Response Header

   A server receiving a request for a protected resource without a valid
   Authorization header field (Section 5) MUST respond with a 401 status
   code (Unauthorized), and includes at least one "WWW-Authenticate"
   header field including a token scheme challenge.

   The "WWW-Authenticate" header field uses the framework defined by

   [RFC2617] as follows:

    challenge       = "Token" RWS token-challenge

    token-challenge = realm
                      CS coverage-list
                      [ CS timestamp ]

    coverage-list   = "coverage" "=" <"> 1#coverage-name <">
    coverage-name   = "none" /
                      "base" /
                      "base+body-sha-256" /
                      token

    timestamp       = "timestamp" "=" <"> 1*DIGIT <">

    CS              = OWF "," OWF


4.1.  The 'realm' Attribute

4.2.  The 'coverage' Attribute

   The list of authentication coverage names supported by the server,
   provided as a space-delimited list.  If omitted, the attribute
   defaults to "base".  Authentication coverage is described in
   Section 8.

4.3.  The 'timestamp' Attribute

   Signature-based and hash-based authentication methods use timestamps
   in combination with unique nonce values to protect against replay
   attacks when used over an unsecure channel.

   The timestamp attribute is used by the server to publish its current
   time, enabling clients to synchronize their close with the server.
   The timestamp value is the current time expressed in the number of
   seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT, and MUST be a positive
   integer.

   To avoid the need to retain an infinite number of nonce values for
   future checks, servers MAY choose to restrict the time period after
   which a request with an old timestamp is rejected.  Servers applying
   such a restriction SHOULD provide their current time to the client
   either in every challenge or when a request fails due to a timestamp
   outside the allowed window.

5.  The Authorization Request Header

   A client making a request for a protected resource either directly,
   or in retrying a request after receiving a 401 status code
   (Unauthorized) with a token challenge, MUST include at least one
   "Authorization" header field including token scheme credentials.

   The "Authorization" header field uses the framework defined by
   [RFC2617] as follows:

    credentials    = "Token" RWS token-response

    token-response = token-id
                     CS coverage
                     [ CS nonce ]
                     [ CS timestamp ]
                     [ CS auth ]

    token-id         = "token" "=" <"> token <">
    coverage         = "coverage" "=" <"> coverage-name <">
    nonce            = "nonce" "=" <"> token <">
    auth             = "auth" "=" <"> token <">


5.1.  The 'token' Attribute

   The value used to identify the set of token credentials used by the
   client to authenticate.  The token identifier can be an opaque string
   or use a well-defined internal structure.

5.2.  The 'coverage' Attribute

   The name of the authentication coverage method used by the client to
   make the request.  If the attribute is omitted, its value defaults to
   "base".

5.3.  The 'nonce' Attribute

   A random string, uniquely generated by the client to allow the server
   to verify that a request has never been made before and helps prevent
   replay attacks when requests are made over a non-secure channel.  The
   nonce value MUST be unique across all requests with the same
   timestamp and token combinations.

5.4.  The 'timestamp' Attribute

   The timestamp value is the current time expressed in the number of
   seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT, and MUST be a positive

   integer.

5.5.  The 'auth' Attribute

   The output of the authentication method function after applying it to
   the selected coverage as described in Section 7.


6.  The Authentication-Error Response Header

   A server receiving a request for a protected resource with an invalid
   Authorization header field (Section 5) MAY includes the
   "Authentication-Error" header field providing the client with
   information to help it successfully authenticate with the server.

   The "Authentication-Error" header field is defined as follows:

    Authentication-Error   = "Authentication-Error" ":"
                             OWS #1error-param

    error-param            = error-code /
                             error-info /
                             error-message /
                             auth-param

    error-code      = "error-code"    "=" <"> token <">
    error-info      = "error-info"    "=" <"> token <">
    error-message   = "error-message" "=" quoted-string


6.1.  The 'error-code' attribute

6.2.  The 'error-info' attribute

6.3.  The 'error-message' attribute


7.  Authentication Methods

   In order for the server to verify the authenticity of the request and
   prevent unauthorized access, the client must prove it is the rightful
   owner of the credentials.  This is accomplished using the
   authentication method associated with the token.

   This specification provides three methods for the client to prove its
   rightful ownership of the credentials: "hmac-sha-1", "hmac-sha-256",
   and "rsassa-pkcs1-v1.5-sha-256".  In addition, the "none" method is
   defined to allow the use of bearer token which does not utilizes any

   cryptographic means.

                      token


   The authentication process does not change the request or its
   parameters, with the exception of the "auth" attribute.

7.1.  The 'none' Method

   The "none" method does not employ a cryptographic algorithm and does
   not provide any security on its own.  Servers utilizing this method
   use the token identifier as a bearer token, relying solely on the
   value of the token identifier to authenticate the client.

   The "nonce", "timestamp", and "auth" attributes are not used, and
   SHOULD NOT be included in authenticated requests.  The "coverage"
   attribute MUST be set to "none" but MAY be omitted from the request.
   Nevertheless, these attributes MUST be included in the normalized
   request string together with any other authentication attributes.

7.2.  The 'hmac-sha-1' Method

   The "hmac-sha-1" authentication method uses the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm
   as defined in [RFC2104]:

     digest = HMAC-SHA1 (key, text)


   The HMAC-SHA1 function variables are used in following way:

   text
         is set to the value of the normalize request string as
         described in Section 8.

   key
         is set to the shared-secret associated with the token.

   digest
         is used to set the value of the "auth" attribute, after the
         result octet string is base64-encoded per [RFC2045] section
         6.8.

7.3.  The 'hmac-sha-256' Method

   The "hmac-sha-256" authentication method uses the HMAC algorithm as
   defined in [RFC2104] together with the SHA-256 hash function defined
   in [NIST FIPS-180-3]:

     digest = HMAC-SHA256 (key, text)


   The HMAC-SHA256 function variables are used in following way:

   text
         is set to the value of the normalize request string as
         described in Section 8.

   key
         is set to the shared-secret associated with the token.

   digest
         is used to set the value of the "auth" attribute, after the
         result octet string is base64-encoded per [RFC2045] section
         6.8.

7.4.  The 'rsassa-pkcs1-v1.5-sha-256' Method

   The "rsassa-pkcs1-v1.5-sha-256" signature method uses the RSASSA-
   PKCS1-v1_5 signature algorithm as defined in [RFC3447] section 8.2
   (also known as PKCS#1), using SHA-256 as the hash function as defined
   in [NIST FIPS-180-3] for EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5.

   The normalized request string is signed using the RSA private key
   associated with the token as defined in [RFC3447] section 8.2.1:

     S = RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-SIGN (K, M)


   Where:

   K
         is set to the RSA private key associated with the token,

   M
         is set to the value of the normalized request string described
         in Section 8, and

Internet-Draft            Token Authentication             February 2010


   S
         is the result signature used to set the value of the "auth"
         attribute, after the result octet string is base64-encoded per
         [RFC2045] section 6.8.

   The server verifies the signature per [RFC3447] section 8.2.2:

     RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-VERIFY ((n, e), M, S)


   Where:

   (n, e)
         is set to the RSA public key associated with the token,

   M
         is set to the value of the normalized request string described
         in Section 8, and

   S
         is set to the octet string value of the "auth" attribute
         received from the client.


8.  Coverage Methods

   The normalized request string is a consistent, reproducible
   concatenation of several of the HTTP request elements into a single
   string.  The string is used as an input to the authentication methods
   with the exception of "none".

8.1.  The 'base' Method

   When using the "base" method, the normalized request string includes
   the following components of the HTTP request:

   o  The HTTP request method (e.g.  "GET", "POST", etc.).

   o  The authority as declared by the HTTP "Host" request header.

   o  The request resource URI.

   o  The Authorization header field (Section 5) attributes, with the
      exception of the "auth" attribute.

   The "base" normalized request string does not cover the entire HTTP
   request.  Most notably, it does not include the entity-body or most
   HTTP entity-headers.  It is important to note that the server cannot

Internet-Draft            Token Authentication             February 2010


   verify the authenticity of the excluded request elements without
   using additional protections such as SSL/TLS or other methods.

8.1.1.  String Construction

   The normalized request string is constructed by concatenating
   together, in order, the following HTTP request elements:

   1.  The HTTP request method in uppercase.  For example: "HEAD",
       "GET", "POST", etc.

   2.  A "," character (ASCII code 44).

   3.  The hostname, colon-separated (ASCII code 58) from the TCP port
       used to make the request as included in the HTTP request "Host"
       header field.  The port MUST be included even if it is not
       included in the "Host" header field (i.e. the default port for
       the scheme).

   4.  A "," character (ASCII code 44).

   5.  Any authentication attribute, with the exception of the "auth",
       which is assigned a value (including default values), are added
       to the normalized request string as follows:

       1.  The name of each parameter is concatenated to its
           corresponding value using an "=" character (ASCII code 61) as
           separator, even if the value is empty.

       2.  The name/value pairs are sorted using ascending byte value
           ordering.

       3.  The sorted name/value pairs are concatenated together into a
           single string by using a "," character (ASCII code 44) as
           separator.

   6.  A "," character (ASCII code 44).

   7.  The request resource URI.

8.2.  The 'base+body-hmac-sha-256' Method

   The "base+body-hmac-sha-256" method added the request entity-body to
   the elements included in the normalized request string.  It does not
   include the entity-body directly in the normalized string.  Instead,
   it calculates the hash value of the entity-body using the SHA-256
   hash function defined in [NIST FIPS-180-3].

Internet-Draft            Token Authentication             February 2010


   The normalized request string is constructed following the same
   process defined in Section 8.1.1, with the following addition:

   o  Before constructing the string, the entity-body hash is calculated
      by applying the SHA-256 hash function on the raw entity-body
      content.

   o  The hash value is added to the list of authentication attributes
      by assigning its value to the "body-hash" attribute name.  This is
      done prior to the attributes being sorted and added to the string.

   o  The "body-hash" attribute is only included in the normalized
      request string and is not added to the Authorization header field
      (Section 5).


9.  Scheme Extensions


10.  Security Considerations

   As stated in [RFC2617], the greatest sources of risks are usually
   found not in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures
   surrounding its use.  Implementers are strongly encouraged to assess
   how this protocol addresses their security requirements.

10.1.  Credentials Transmission

   This specification does not describe any mechanism for obtaining or
   transmitting raw tokens credentials.  Methods used to obtain tokens
   should ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport-
   layer mechanisms such as TLS or SSL.

10.2.  Confidentiality of Requests

   While this protocol provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity
   of requests, it provides no guarantee of request confidentiality.
   Unless further precautions are taken, eavesdroppers will have full
   access to request content.  Servers should carefully consider the
   kinds of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and should
   employ transport-layer security mechanisms to protect sensitive
   resources.

10.3.  Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers

   This protocol makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the
   server.  A hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting
   the client's requests and returning misleading or otherwise incorrect



Hammer-Lahav             Expires August 7, 2010                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft            Token Authentication             February 2010


   responses.  Service providers should consider such attacks when
   developing services using this protocol, and should require
   transport-layer security for any requests where the authenticity of
   the server or of request responses is an issue.

10.4.  Plaintext Storage of Credentials

   When used with a symmetric shared-secret authentication method, the
   token shared-secret function the same way passwords do in traditional
   authentication systems.  In order to compute the signatures used in
   methods, the server must have access to these secrets in plaintext
   form.  This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems,
   which store only a one-way hash of user credentials.

   If an attacker were to gain access to these secrets - or worse, to
   the server's database of all such secrets - he or she would be able
   to perform any action on behalf of any resource owner.  Accordingly,
   it is critical that servers protect these secrets from unauthorized
   access.

10.5.  Scoping of Access Requests

   By itself, this protocol does not provide any method for scoping the
   access rights granted to a client.  However, most applications do
   require greater granularity of access rights.  For example, servers
   may wish to make it possible to grant access to some protected
   resources but not others, or to grant only limited access (such as
   read-only access) to those protected resources.

   When implementing this protocol, servers should consider the types of
   access resource owners may wish to grant clients, and should provide
   mechanisms to do so.  Servers should also take care to ensure that
   resource owners understand the access they are granting, as well as
   any risks that may be involved.

10.6.  Entropy of Secrets

   Unless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers
   will have full access to authenticated requests and signatures, and
   will thus be able to mount offline brute-force attacks to recover the
   credentials used.  Servers should be careful to assign shared-secrets
   which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for
   at least the length of time that the shared-secrets are valid.

   For example, if shared-secrets are valid for two weeks, servers
   should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force attack
   that recovers the shared-secret in less than two weeks.  Of course,
   servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the longest



Hammer-Lahav             Expires August 7, 2010                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft            Token Authentication             February 2010


   secrets reasonable.

   It is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator
   (PRNG) used to generate these secrets be of sufficiently high
   quality.  Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that
   may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit patterns or
   other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks
   easier.  Implementers should be careful to use cryptographically
   secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.

10.7.  Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion Attacks

   This specification includes a number of features which may make
   resource exhaustion attacks against servers possible.  For example,
   this protocol requires servers to track used nonces.  If an attacker
   is able to use many nonces quickly, the resources required to track
   them may exhaust available capacity.  And again, this protocol can
   require servers to perform potentially expensive computations in
   order to verify the signature on incoming requests.  An attacker may
   exploit this to perform a denial of service attack by sending a large
   number of invalid requests to the server.

   Resource Exhaustion attacks are by no means specific to this
   specification.  However, implementers should be careful to consider
   the additional avenues of attack that this protocol exposes, and
   design their implementations accordingly.  For example, entropy
   starvation typically results in either a complete denial of service
   while the system waits for new entropy or else in weak (easily
   guessable) secrets.  When implementing this protocol, servers should
   consider which of these presents a more serious risk for their
   application and design accordingly.

10.8.  Coverage Limitations

   The normalized request string has been designed to support the
   authentication methods defined in this specification.  Those
   designing additional methods, should evaluated the compatibility of
   the normalized request string with their security requirements.
   Since the normalized request string does not cover the entire HTTP
   request, servers should employ additional mechanisms to protect such
   elements.

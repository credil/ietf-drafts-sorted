        OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource
        owner (such as a different client or an end-user). It also provides a process for end-users
        to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials
        (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The OAuth protocol was originally created by a small community of web developers from a
        variety of websites and other Internet services, who wanted to solve the common problem of
        enabling delegated access to protected resources.  The resulting OAuth protocol was
        stabilized at version 1.0 in October 2007, revised in June 2009, and published as
        <xref target="OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification provides an informational documentation of the OAuth 1.0 protocol as
        revised in <xref target="OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A" />, and includes several errata
        reported since that time, as well as numerous editorial clarifications. The publication
        of this specification represents the transfer of change control from the community to the
        IETF by the authors of the original work.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the traditional client-server authentication model, the client uses its credentials to
        access its resources hosted by the server. With the increasing use of distributed web
        services and cloud computing, third-party applications require access to these
        server-hosted resources.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth introduces a third role to the traditional client-server authentication model: the
        resource owner. In the OAuth model, the client (which is not the resource owner, but
        is acting on its behalf) requests access to resources controlled by the resource owner, but
        hosted by the server. In addition, OAuth allows the server to verify not only the resource
        owner authorization, but also the identity of the client making the request.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource
        owner (such as a different client or an end-user). It also provides a process for end-users
        to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials
        (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a web user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access to
        her private photos stored at a photo sharing service (server), without sharing her
        username and password with the printing service. Instead, she authenticates directly with
        the photo sharing service which issues the printing service delegation-specific credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order for the client to access resources, it first has to obtain permission from the
        resource owner. This permission is expressed in the form of a token and matching
        shared-secret. The purpose of the token is to make it unnecessary for the resource owner to
        share its credentials with the client. Unlike the resource owner credentials, tokens can be
        issued with a restricted scope and limited lifetime, and revoked independently.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification consists of two parts. The first part defines a redirection-based
        user-agent process for end-users to authorize client access to their resources, by
        authenticating directly with the server and provisioning tokens to the client for use with
        the authentication method. The second part defines a method for making authenticated HTTP
        <xref target="RFC2616" /> requests using two sets of credentials, one identifying the
        client making the request, and a second identifying the resource owner on whose behalf the
        request is being made.
      </t>
      <t>
        The use of OAuth with any other transport protocol than <xref target="RFC2616" /> is
        undefined.

              <vspace />
              Credentials are a pair of a unique identifier and a matching shared secret. OAuth
              defines three classes of credentials: client, temporary, and token, used to identify
              and authenticate the client making the request, the authorization request, and the
              access grant, respectively.

              authenticated requests with the resource owner whose authorization is requested or
              has been obtained by the client. Tokens have a matching shared-secret that is used
              by the client to establish its ownership of the token, and its authority to represent
              the resource owner.

      <section title="Example">
        <t>
          Jane (resource owner) has recently uploaded some private vacation photos (protected
          resources) to her photo sharing site 'photos.example.net' (server). She would like to use
          the 'printer.example.com' website (client) to print one of these photos. Typically, Jane
          signs-into 'photos.example.net' using her username and password.
        </t>
        <t>
          However, Jane does not wish to share her username and password with the 'printer.example.com'
          website, which needs to access the photo in order to print it. In order to provide its
          users with better service, 'printer.example.com' has signed-up for a set of 'photos.example.net'
          client credentials ahead of time:

          </list>

          The 'printer.example.com' website has also configured its application to use the protocol
          endpoints listed in the 'photos.example.net' API documentation, which use the
          <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> signature method:

        <t>
          Before 'printer.example.com' can ask Jane to grant it access to the photos, it must
          first establish a set of temporary credentials with 'photos.example.net' to identify
          the delegation request. To do so, the client sends the following HTTPS
          <xref target="RFC2818" /> request to the server:

          The server requests Jane to sign-in using her username and password and if successful,
          asks her to approve granting 'printer.example.com' access to her private photos. Jane
          approves the request and her user-agent is redirected to the callback URI provided by

    <section title="Redirection-Based Authorization" anchor="redirect_workflow">
      <t>
        OAuth uses tokens to represent the authorization granted to the client by the resource
        owner. Typically, token credentials are issued by the server at the resource owner's
        request, after authenticating the resource owner's identity (usually using a username and
        password).
      </t>
      <t>
        There are many ways in which a server can facilitate the provisioning of token credentials.
        This section defines one such way, using HTTP redirections and the resource owner's
        user-agent. This redirection-based authorization method includes three steps:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            The client obtains a set of temporary credentials from the server (in the form of an
            identifier and shared-secret). The temporary credentials are used to identify the
            access request throughout the authorization process.
          </t>
          <t>
            The resource owner authorizes the server to grant the client's access request
            (identified by the temporary credentials).
          </t>
          <t>
            The client uses the temporary credentials to request a set of token credentials from
            the server, which will enable it to access the resource owner's protected resources.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The server MUST revoke the temporary credentials after being used once to obtain the token
        credentials. It is RECOMMENDED that the temporary credentials have a limited lifetime.
        Servers SHOULD enable resource owners to revoke token credentials after they have been
        issued to clients.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order for the client to perform these steps, the server needs to advertise the URIs of
        the following three endpoints:

        <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
          <t hangText="Temporary Credential Request">
            <vspace />
            The endpoint used by the client to obtain a set of temporary credentials as described
            in <xref target="auth_step1" />.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Resource Owner Authorization">
            <vspace />
            The endpoint to which the resource owner is redirected to grant authorization as
            described in <xref target="auth_step2" />.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Token Request">
            <vspace />
            The endpoint used by the client to request a set of token credentials using the
            set of temporary credentials as described in <xref target="auth_step3" />.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The three URIs advertised by the server MAY include a query component as defined by
        <xref target="RFC3986" /> section 3, but if present, the query MUST NOT contain any
        parameters beginning with the <spanx style="verb">oauth_</spanx> prefix, to avoid conflicts
        with the protocol parameters added to the URIs when used.
      </t>
      <t>
        The methods in which the server advertises and documents its three endpoints are beyond the
        scope of this specification. Clients should avoid making assumptions about the size of
        tokens and other server-generated values, which are left undefined by this specification.
        In addition, protocol parameters MAY include values which require encoding when
        transmitted. Clients and servers should not make assumptions about the possible range of
        their values.
      </t>
      
      <section title="Temporary Credentials" anchor="auth_step1">
        <t>
          The client obtains a set of temporary credentials from the server by making an
          <xref target="requests">authenticated</xref> HTTP <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>
          request to the Temporary Credential Request endpoint (unless the server advertises
          another HTTP request method for the client to use). The client constructs a request URI
          by adding the following REQUIRED parameter to the request (in addition to the other
          protocol parameters, using the same parameter transmission method):

          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
            <t hangText="oauth_callback:">
              An absolute URI to which the server will redirect the resource owner back when the
              Resource Owner Authorization step (<xref target="auth_step2" />) is completed. If the
              client is unable to receive callbacks or a callback URI has been established via other
              means, the parameter value MUST be set to <spanx style="verb">oob</spanx> (case sensitive),
              to indicate an out-of-band configuration.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Servers MAY specify additional parameters.">
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          When making the request, the client authenticates using only the client credentials. The
          client MAY omit the empty <spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> protocol parameter
          from the request and MUST use the empty string as the token secret value.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since the request results in the transmission of plain text credentials in the HTTP
          response, the server MUST require the use of a transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS
          or SSL (or a secure channel with equivalent protections).
        </t>
        <figure>

        <t>
          Before the client requests a set of token credentials from the server, it MUST send
          the user to the server to authorize the request. The client constructs a request URI by
          adding the following REQUIRED query parameter to the Resource Owner Authorization
          endpoint URI:

          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
            <t hangText="oauth_token">
              <vspace />
              The temporary credentials identifier obtained in <xref target="auth_step1" />
              in the <spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> parameter. Servers MAY declare this
              parameter as OPTIONAL, in which case they MUST provide a way for the resource owner
              to indicate the identifier through other means.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Servers MAY specify additional parameters.">
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an HTTP redirection
          response, or by other means available to it via the resource owner's user-agent. The
          request MUST use the HTTP <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx> method.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the client redirects the resource owner's user-agent to make the following
            HTTPS request:
          </preamble>
          <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
  GET /authorize_access?oauth_token=hdk48Djdsa HTTP/1.1

]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          The way in which the server handles the authorization request, including whether it uses
          a secure channel such as TLS/SSL is beyond the scope of this specification. However, the
          server MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner.
        </t>
        <t>
          When asking the resource owner to authorize the requested access, the server SHOULD
          present to the resource owner information about the client requesting access based on the
          association of the temporary credentials with the client identity. When displaying any
          such information, the server SHOULD indicate if the information has been verified.
        </t>
        <t>
          After receiving an authorization decision from the resource owner, the server redirects
          the resource owner to the callback URI if one was provided in the
          <spanx style="verb">oauth_callback</spanx> parameter or by other means.
        </t>
        <t>
          To make sure that the resource owner granting access is the same resource owner returning
          back to the client to complete the process, the server MUST generate a verification code:
          an unguessable value passed to the client via the resource owner and REQUIRED to complete
          the process. The server constructs the request URI by adding the following REQUIRED
          parameters to the callback URI query component:

          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
            <t hangText="oauth_token">
              <vspace />
              The temporary credentials identifier received from the client.
            </t>
            <t hangText="oauth_verifier">
              <vspace />
              The verification code.
            </t>
          </list>

          If the callback URI already includes a query component, the server MUST append the
          OAuth parameters to the end of the existing query.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the server redirects the resource owner's user-agent to make the following
            HTTP request:
          </preamble>
          <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[

]]>
					</artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          If the client did not provide a callback URI, the server SHOULD display the value of the
          verification code, and instruct the resource owner to manually inform the client that
          authorization is completed. If the server knows a client to be running on a limited device
          it SHOULD ensure that the verifier value is suitable for manual entry.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Token Credentials" anchor="auth_step3">
        <t>
          The client obtains a set of token credentials from the server by making an
          <xref target="requests">authenticated</xref> HTTP <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>
          request to the Token Request endpoint (unless the server advertises another HTTP
          request method for the client to use). The client constructs a request URI by adding the
          following REQUIRED parameter to the request (in addition to the other protocol
          parameters, using the same parameter transmission method):

          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
            <t hangText="oauth_verifier">
              <vspace />
              The verification code received from the server in the previous step.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          When making the request, the client authenticates using the client credentials as well as
          the temporary credentials. The temporary credentials are used as a substitute for token
          credentials in the authenticated request and transmitted using the
          <spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> parameter.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since the request results in the transmission of plain text credentials in the HTTP
          response, the server MUST require the use of a transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS
          or SSL (or a secure channel with equivalent protections).
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>

        </t>
        <t>
          Once the client receives and stores the token credentials, it can proceed to access
          protected resources on behalf of the resource owner by making

          together with the token credentials received.

    <section title="Authenticated Requests" anchor="requests">
      <t>
        The HTTP authentication methods defined by <xref target="RFC2617" />, enable clients
        to make authenticated HTTP requests. Clients using these methods gain access to protected
        resources by using their credentials (typically a username and password pair), which
        allow the server to verify their authenticity. Using these methods for delegation requires
        the client to assume the role of the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth provides a method designed to include two sets of credentials with each request, one
        to identify the client, and another to identify the resource owner. Before a client can
        make authenticated requests on behalf of the resource owner, it must obtain a token
        authorized by the resource owner. <xref target="redirect_workflow" /> provides one such
        method through which the client can obtain a token authorized by the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client credentials take the form of a unique identifier, and an associated shared-secret
        or RSA key pair. Prior to making authenticated requests, the client establishes a set of
        credentials with the server. The process and requirements for provisioning these are
        outside the scope of this specification. Implementers are urged to consider the security
        ramifications of using client credentials, some of which are described in
        <xref target="client_cred_sec" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        Making authenticated requests requires prior knowledge of the server's configuration.
        OAuth includes multiple methods for transmitting protocol parameters with requests
				(<xref target="param_include" />), as well as multiple methods for the client to
        prove its rightful ownership of the credentials used (<xref target="signature" />).
        The way in which clients discover the required configuration is outside the scope of
        this specification.

      <section title="Making Requests">
        <t>
          An authenticated request includes several protocol parameters. Each parameter name
          begins with the <spanx style="verb">oauth_</spanx> prefix, and the parameter names and
          values are case sensitive. Clients make authenticated requests by calculating the values
          of a set of protocol parameters and adding them to the HTTP request as follows:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              The client assigns value to each of these REQUIRED (unless specified otherwise)

                  parameter name reflects a deprecated term (Consumer Key) used in previous
                  revisions of the specification, and has been retained to maintain backward

            <t>
              If using the <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> or
              <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> signature methods, ensure that the combination
              of nonce/timestamp/token (if present) received from the client has not been used
              before in a previous request (the server MAY reject requests with stale timestamps as
              described in <xref target="nonce" />).
            </t>
            <t>
              If a token is present, verify the scope and status of the client authorization as
              represented by the token (the server MAY choose to restrict token usage to the client
              to which it was issued).
            </t>
            <t>
              If the <spanx style="verb">oauth_version</spanx> parameter is present, ensure its

            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          If the request fails verification, the server SHOULD respond with the appropriate HTTP
          response status code. The server MAY include further details about why the request was
          rejected in the response body.
        </t>
        <t>
          The server SHOULD return a 400 (bad request) status code
          when receiving a request with unsupported parameters, unsupported signature method,
          missing parameters, or duplicated protocol parameters. The server SHOULD return a 401
          (unauthorized) status code when receiving a request with invalid client credentials,
          invalid or expired token, invalid signature, or invalid or used nonce.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Nonce and Timestamp" anchor="nonce">
        <t>
          The timestamp value MUST be a positive integer. Unless otherwise specified by the
          server's documentation, the timestamp is expressed in the number of seconds since
          January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.
        </t>
        <t>
          A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated by the client to allow the server to
          verify that a request has never been made before and helps prevent replay attacks when
          requests are made over a non-secure channel. The nonce value MUST be unique across all
          requests with the same timestamp, client credentials, and token combinations.
        </t>
        <t>
          To avoid the need to retain an infinite number of nonce values for future checks, servers
          MAY choose to restrict the time period after which a request with an old timestamp is
          rejected. Note that this restriction implies a level of synchronization between the
          client's and server's clocks. Servers applying such a restriction MAY provide a way for
          the client to sync with the server's clock; alternatively both systems could synchronize
          with a trusted time service. Details of clock synchronization strategies are beyond the
          scope of this specification.
        </t>

      <section title="Signature" anchor="signature">
        <t>
					OAuth-authenticated requests can have two sets of credentials: those passed via the
					<spanx style="verb">oauth_consumer_key</spanx> parameter and those in the
					<spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> parameter. In order for the server to
          verify the authenticity of the request and prevent unauthorized access, the client needs
          to prove that it is the rightful owner of the credentials. This is accomplished using the
          shared-secret (or RSA key) part of each set of credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          OAuth provides three methods for the client to prove its rightful ownership of the
          credentials: <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>,
          and <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx>. These methods are generally referred to as
          signature methods, even though <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx> does not involve a
          signature. In addition, <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> utilizes an RSA key instead
          of the shared-secrets associated with the client credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          OAuth does not mandate a particular signature method, as each implementation can have its
          own unique requirements. Servers are free to implement and document their own custom
          methods. Recommending any particular method is beyond the scope of this specification.
          Implementers should review the <xref target="Security">Security Considerations section</xref>
          before deciding on which method to support.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client declares which signature method is used via the
          <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature_method</spanx> parameter. It then generates a signature
          (or a string of an equivalent value), and includes it in the
          <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter. The server verifies the signature
          as specified for each method.
        </t>
        <t>
          The signature process does not change the request or its parameters, with the exception of
          the <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter.
        </t>

        <section title="Signature Base String">
          <t>
            The signature base string is a consistent, reproducible concatenation of several
            of the HTTP request elements into a single string. The string is used as an input to
            the <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>
            signature methods.
          </t>
          <t>
            The signature base string includes the following components of the HTTP request:
            
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                The HTTP request method (e.g. <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx>,
                <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>, etc.).
              </t>
              <t>
                The authority as declared by the HTTP <spanx style="verb">Host</spanx> request
                header field.
              </t>
              <t>
                The path and query components of the request resource URI.
              </t>
              <t>
                The protocol parameters excluding the
                <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx>.
              </t>
              <t>
                Parameters included in the request entity-body if they comply with the strict
                restrictions defined in <xref target="collect_param" />.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            The signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request. Most notably, it
            does not include the entity-body in most requests, nor does it include most HTTP
            entity-headers. It is important to note that the server cannot verify the authenticity
            of the excluded request components without using additional protections such as SSL/TLS or
            other methods.

          <section title="String Construction" anchor="base_string">
            <t>

              <list style="numbers">

      <section title="Percent Encoding" anchor="encoding">
        <t>
          Existing percent-encoding methods do not guarantee a consistent construction of the
          signature base string. The following percent-encoding method is not defined to replace
          the existing encoding methods defined by <xref target="RFC3986" /> and
          <xref target="W3C.REC-html40-19980424" />. It is used only in the construction of the
          signature base string and the <xref target="auth_header">authorization header field</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification defines the following method for percent-encoding strings:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              Text values are first encoded as UTF-8 octets per <xref target="RFC3629" /> if they are
              not already. This does not include binary values which are not intended for human
              consumption.
            </t>
            <t>
              The values are then escaped using the <xref target="RFC3986" /> percent-encoding
              (%XX) mechanism as follows:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  Characters in the unreserved character set as defined by <xref target="RFC3986" />
                  section 2.3 (ALPHA, DIGIT, "-", ".", "_", "~") MUST NOT be encoded.
                </t>
                <t>
                  All other characters MUST be encoded.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The two hexadecimal characters used to represent encoded characters MUST be
                  upper case.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          This method is different from the encoding scheme used by the
          <spanx style="verb">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> content-type (for example,
          it encodes space characters as <spanx style="verb">%20</spanx> and not using the 
          <spanx style="verb">+</spanx> character). It MAY be different from the
          percent-encoding functions provided by web development frameworks (e.g. encode different
          characters, use lower case hexadecimal characters).
        </t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">
      <t>
        As stated in <xref target="RFC2617" />, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not
        in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use. Implementers
        are strongly encouraged to assess how this protocol addresses their security requirements.
      </t>

      <section title="RSA-SHA1 Signature Method">
        <t>
          Authenticated requests made with <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> signatures do not
          use the token shared-secret, or any provisioned client shared-secret. This means the request
          relies completely on the secrecy of the private key used by the client to sign requests.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Confidentiality of Requests">
        <t>
          While this protocol provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of requests, it
          provides no guarantee of request confidentiality. Unless further precautions are taken,
          eavesdroppers will have full access to request content. Servers should carefully consider
          the kinds of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and should employ
          transport-layer security mechanisms to protect sensitive resources.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers">
        <t>
          This protocol makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the server. A hostile party
          could take advantage of this by intercepting the client's requests and returning
          misleading or otherwise incorrect responses. Service providers should consider such
          attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should require transport-layer
          security for any requests where the authenticity of the server or of request responses is
          an issue.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Proxying and Caching of Authenticated Content">
        <t>
          The <xref target="auth_header">HTTP Authorization scheme</xref> is optional. However,
          <xref target="RFC2616" /> relies on the <spanx style="verb">Authorization</spanx> and
          <spanx style="verb">WWW-Authenticate</spanx> header fields to distinguish authenticated content
          so that it can be protected. Proxies and caches, in particular, may fail to adequately
          protect requests not using these header fields.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, private authenticated content may be stored in (and thus retrievable from)
          publicly-accessible caches. Servers not using the
          <xref target="auth_header">HTTP Authorization header field</xref> should take care to use other
          mechanisms, such as the <spanx style="verb">Cache-Control</spanx> header field, to ensure that
          authenticated content is protected.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Plaintext Storage of Credentials">
        <t>
          The client shared-secret and token shared-secret function the same way passwords do in
          traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the signatures used in methods
          other than <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>, the server must have access to these
          secrets in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems,
          which store only a one-way hash of user credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          If an attacker were to gain access to these secrets - or worse, to the server's database
          of all such secrets - he or she would be able to perform any action on behalf of any
          resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these secrets from
          unauthorized access.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Secrecy of the Client Credentials" anchor="client_cred_sec">
        <t>
          In many cases, the client application will be under the control of potentially untrusted
          parties. For example, if the client is a desktop application with freely available
          source code or an executable binary, an attacker may be able to download a copy for
          analysis. In such cases, attackers will be able to recover the client credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          Accordingly, servers should not use the client credentials alone to verify the identity
          of the client. Where possible, other factors such as IP address should be used as well.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Phishing Attacks">
        <t>
          Wide deployment of this and similar protocols may cause resource owners to become inured
          to the practice of being redirected to websites where they are asked to enter their
          passwords. If resource owners are not careful to verify the authenticity of these
          websites before entering their credentials, it will be possible for attackers to exploit
          this practice to steal resource owners' passwords.
        </t>
        <t>
          Servers should attempt to educate resource owners about the risks phishing attacks pose,
          and should provide mechanisms that make it easy for resource owners to confirm the
          authenticity of their sites. Client developers should consider the security implications
          of how they interact with a user-agent (e.g. separate window, embedded), and the ability
          of the end-user to verify the authenticity of the server website.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scoping of Access Requests">
        <t>
          By itself, this protocol does not provide any method for scoping the access rights
          granted to a client. However, most applications do require greater granularity of access
          rights. For example, servers may wish to make it possible to grant access to some
          protected resources but not others, or to grant only limited access (such as read-only
          access) to those protected resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          When implementing this protocol, servers should consider the types of access resource
          owners may wish to grant clients, and should provide mechanisms to do so. Servers should
          also take care to ensure that resource owners understand the access they are granting, as
          well as any risks that may be involved.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Entropy of Secrets">
        <t>
          Unless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access
          to authenticated requests and signatures, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force
          attacks to recover the credentials used. Servers should be careful to assign
          shared-secrets which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at
          least the length of time that the shared-secrets are valid.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, if shared-secrets are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is
          not possible to mount a brute force attack that recovers the shared-secret in less than
          two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the longest
          secrets reasonable.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate
          these secrets be of sufficiently high quality. Many PRNG implementations generate number
          sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit patterns or other
          weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be
          careful to use cryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion Attacks">
        <t>
          This specification includes a number of features which may make resource exhaustion
          attacks against servers possible. For example, this protocol requires servers to track
          used nonces. If an attacker is able to use many nonces quickly, the resources required to
          track them may exhaust available capacity. And again, this protocol can require servers
          to perform potentially expensive computations in order to verify the signature on
          incoming requests. An attacker may exploit this to perform a denial of service attack by
          sending a large number of invalid requests to the server.
        </t>
        <t>
          Resource Exhaustion attacks are by no means specific to this specification. However,
          implementers should be careful to consider the additional avenues of attack that this
          protocol exposes, and design their implementations accordingly. For example, entropy
          starvation typically results in either a complete denial of service while the system
          waits for new entropy or else in weak (easily guessable) secrets. When implementing this
          protocol, servers should consider which of these presents a more serious risk for their
          application and design accordingly.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="SHA-1 Cryptographic Attacks">
        <t>
          SHA-1, the hash algorithm used in <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> and
          <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> signature methods, has been shown to have a number
          of cryptographic weaknesses that significantly reduce its resistance to collision
          attacks. While these weaknesses do not seem to affect the use of SHA-1 with the
          Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) and should not affect the
          <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> signature method, it may affect the use of the
          <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> signature method. NIST has announced that it will
          phase out use of SHA-1 in digital signtures by 2010 <xref target="NIST SHA-1 Comments" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          Practically speaking, these weaknesses are difficult to exploit, and by themselves do not
          pose a significant risk to users of this protocol. They may, however, make more efficient
          attacks possible, and  Servers should take this into account when considering whether
          SHA-1 provides an adequate level of security for their applications.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Signature Base String Limitations">
        <t>
          The signature base string has been designed to support the signature methods defined in
          this specification. Those designing additional signature methods, should evaluated the
          compatibility of the signature base string with their security requirements.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since the signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request, such as most
          request entity-body, most entity-headers, and the order in which parameters are sent,
          servers should employ additional mechanisms to protect such elements.
        </t>
      </section>

			<section title="Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)">
				<t>
					Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a web-based attack whereby HTTP requests are
          transmitted from a user that the website trusts or has authenticated. CSRF attacks on
          authorization approvals can allow an attacker to obtain authorization to protected
          resources without the consent of the User. Servers SHOULD strongly consider best
          practices in CSRF prevention at all the protocol authorization endpoints.
				</t>
				<t>
					CSRF attacks on OAuth callback URIs hosted by clients are also possible. Clients should
          prevent CSRF attacks on OAuth callback URIs by verifying that the resource owner at the
          client site intended to complete the OAuth negotiation with the server. The methods for
          preventing such CSRF attacks are beyond the scope of this specification.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="User Interface Redress">
				<t>
					Servers should protect the authorization process against UI Redress attacks (also known
          as "clickjacking"). As of the time of this writing, no complete defenses against UI
          redress are available. Servers can mitigate the risk of UI redress attacks through the
          following techniques:

					<list style="symbols">
						<t>
              Javascript frame busting.
            </t>
						<t>
              Javascript frame busting, and requiring that browsers have javascript enabled on the
              authorization page.
            </t>
						<t>
              Browser-specific anti-framing techniques.
            </t>
						<t>
              Requiring password reentry before issuing OAuth tokens.
            </t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Automatic Processing of Repeat Authorizations">
				<t>
					Servers may wish to automatically process authorization requests
					(<xref target="auth_step2" />) from clients which have been previously
					authorized by the resource owner. When the resource owner is redirected to the server
					to grant access, the server detects that the resource owner has already granted
					access to that particular client. Instead of prompting the resource owner for approval,
					the server automatically redirects the resource owner back to the client.
				</t>
				<t>
					If the client credentials are compromised, automatic processing creates additional
					security risks. An attacker can use the stolen client credentials to redirect
					the resource owner to the server with an authorization request. The server
					will then grant access to the resource owner's data without the resource owner's
					explicit approval, or even awareness of an attack. If no automatic approval is
					implemented, an attacker must use social engineering to convince the resource owner to
					approve access.
				</t>
				<t>
					Servers can mitigate the risks associated with automatic processing by
					limiting the scope of token credentials obtained through automated approvals. Tokens
					credentials obtained through explicit resource owner consent can remain unaffected. Clients
					can mitigate the risks associated with automatic processing by protecting their client
					credentials.

            signature method, as well as <xref target="auth_step1">requesting temporary credentials</xref>
            and <xref target="auth_step3">obtaining token credentials</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
						Adjusted nonce language to indicate it is unique per token/timestamp/client combination.
					</t>
          <t>
            Removed the requirement for timestamps to be equal to or greater than the timestamp
            used in the previous request.
          </t>
          <t>
            Changed the nonce and timestamp parameters to OPTIONAL when using the
            <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx> signature method.
          </t>
					<t>
						Extended signature base string coverage which includes <spanx style="verb">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx>
						entity-body parameters when the HTTP method used is other than <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx> and URI query
						parameters when the HTTP method used is other than <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx>.
					</t>
					<t>
						Incorporated corrections to the instructions in each signature method to encode the signature
            value before inserting it into the <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter,
            removing errors which would have caused double-encoded values.
					</t>
          <t>
            Allowed omitting the <spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> parameter when empty.
          </t>
          <t>
            Permitted sending requests for temporary credentials with an empty
            <spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> parameter.
          </t>
          <t>
            Removed the restrictions from defining additional <spanx style="verb">oauth_</spanx>
            parameters.

            Initial draft based on the OAuth Core 1.0 community specification
            with the following changes.

          <t>
            Various changes required to accommodate the strict format requirements of the IETF,
            such as moving sections around (Security, Contributors, Introduction, etc.), cleaning
            references, adding IETF specific text, etc.
          </t>
          <t>
            Moved the Parameter Encoding sub-section from section 5 (Parameters) to section 9.1
            (Signature Base String) to make it clear it only applies to the signature base string.
          </t>
          <t>
            Nonce language adjusted to indicate it is unique per token/timestamp/consumer
            combination.
          </t>
          <t>
            Added security language regarding lack of token secrets in RSA-SHA1.
          </t>
          <t>
            Fixed the bug in the Normalize Request Parameters section. Removed the
            <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx> limitation from the third bullet (query parameters).
          </t>
          <t>
            Removed restriction of only signing application/x-www-form-urlencoded in
            <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx> requests, allowing the entity-body to be used with all
            HTTP request methods.

        This document specifies the OAuth Core 1.0 protocol. OAuth provides a method for clients
        to access server resources on behalf of another party (such as a different client or an end
        user). It also provides a redirection-based user agent process for end users to authorize
        access to another party by substituting their credentials (typically, a username and password
        pair) with a different set of delegation-specific credentials. This document is based
	      on revision A of the community specification and includes a few clarifications.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        OAuth provides a method for servers to allow third-party access to protected resources,
        without forcing their end users to share their credentials. This pattern is common among
        services that allow third-party developers to extend the service functionality, by building
        applications using an open API.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a web user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access to
        its private photos stored at a photo sharing service (server), without sharing its
        credentials with the printing service. Instead, the user authenticates directly with
        the photo sharing service and issues the printing service delegation-specific credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth introduces a third role to the traditional client-server authentication model: the
        resource owner. In the OAuth model, the client requests access to resources hosted by the
        server but not controlled by the client, but by the resource owner. In addition, OAuth
        allows the server to verify not only the resource owner's credentials, but also those of
        the client making the request.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order for the client to access resources, it first has to obtain permission from the
        resource owner. This permission is expressed in the form of a token and matching
        shared-secret. The purpose of the token is to substitute the need for the resource owner to
        share its credentials (usually a username and password pair) with the client. Unlike
        resource owner credentials, tokens can be issued with a restricted scope and limited lifetime.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification consists of two parts. The first part defines a method for making
        authenticated HTTP <xref target="RFC2616" /> requests using two sets of credentials, one
        identifying the client making the request, and a second identifying the resource owner on
        whose behalf the request is being made.
      </t>
      <t>
        The second part defines a redirection-based user agent process for end users to authorize
        client access to their resources, by authenticating directly with the server and
        provisioning tokens to the client for use with the authentication method.
      </t>
      <t>
        The use of OAuth with any other transport protocol than <xref target="RFC2616" /> is
        undefined.
      </t>
      <t>
        The OAuth protocol was originally created by a small community of web developers from a
        variety of websites and other Internet services, who wanted to solve the common problem of
        enabling delegated access to protected resources. The resulting OAuth protocol was
        stabilized at version 1.0 in October 2007 and published at the
        <eref target="http://oauth.net">oauth.net website</eref>. This specification provides
        an informational documentation of OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A as finalized in June 2009,
        incorporating several errata reported since that time, as well as numerous editorial
        clarifications. It is not an item of the IETF's OAuth Working Group, which at the time
        of writing is working on an OAuth version that can be appropriate for publication on the
        standards track.

      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Redirection-Based Authorization" anchor="redirect_workflow">
      <t>
        OAuth uses a set of token credentials to represent the authorization granted to the client
        by the resource owner. Typically, token credentials are issued by the server at the
        resource owner's request, after authenticating the resource owner's identity using its
        credentials (usually a username and password pair).
      </t>
      <t>
        There are many ways in which a resource owner can facilitate the provisioning of token
        credentials. This section defines one such way, using HTTP redirections and the resource
        owner's user agent. This redirection-based authorization method includes three steps:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            The client obtains a set of temporary credentials from the server (in the form of an
            identifier and shared-secret).
          </t>
          <t>
            The resource owner authorizes the server to issue token credentials to the client
            using the temporary credentials.
          </t>
          <t>
            The client uses the temporary credentials to request a set of token credentials from
            the server, which will enable it to access the resource owner's protected resources.
            The temporary credentials are discarded.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The temporary credentials MUST be revoked after being used once to obtain the token
        credentials. It is RECOMMENDED that the temporary credentials have a limited lifetime.
        Servers SHOULD enable resource owners to revoke token credentials after they have been
        issued to clients.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order for the client to perform these steps, the server needs to advertise the URIs of
        the following three endpoints:

        <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
          <t hangText="Temporary Credential Request">
            <vspace />
            The endpoint used by the client to obtain a set of temporary credentials as described
            in <xref target="auth_step1" />.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Resource Owner Authorization">
            <vspace />
            The endpoint to which the resource owner is redirected to grant authorization as
            described in <xref target="auth_step2" />.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Token Request">
            <vspace />
            The endpoint used by the client to request a set of token credentials using the
            set of temporary credentials as described in <xref target="auth_step3" />.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The three URIs MAY include a query component as defined by <xref target="RFC3986" />
        section 3, but if present, the query MUST NOT contain any parameters beginning with the
        <spanx style="verb">oauth_</spanx> prefix.
      </t>
      <t>
        The methods in which the server advertises and documents its three endpoints are beyond the
        scope of this specification.
      </t>

      <section title="Temporary Credentials" anchor="auth_step1">
        <t>
          The client obtains a set of temporary credentials from the server by making an
          <xref target="requests">authenticated</xref> HTTP <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>
          request to the Temporary Credential Request endpoint (unless the server advertises
          another HTTP request method for the client to use). The client constructs a request URI
          by adding the following parameter to the request (using the same parameter transmission
          method used for the other protocol parameters):

          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
            <t hangText="oauth_callback:">
              An absolute URI to which the server will redirect the resource owner back when the
              Resource Owner Authorization step (<xref target="auth_step2" />) is completed. If the
              client is unable to receive callbacks or a callback URI has been established via other
              means, the parameter value MUST be set to <spanx style="verb">oob</spanx> (case sensitive),
              to indicate an out-of-band configuration.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Servers MAY specify additional parameters.">
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          When making the request, the client authenticates using only the client credentials. The
          client MUST omit the <spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> protocol parameter from the
          request and use an empty string as the token secret value.
        </t>
        <t>
          The server MUST <xref target="verify_request">verify</xref> the request and if valid,
          respond back to the client with a set of temporary credentials (in the form of an
          identifier and shared-secret). The temporary credentials are included in the HTTP
          response body using the <spanx style="verb">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx>
          content type as defined by <xref target="W3C.REC-html40-19980424" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          The response contains the following parameters:

          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
            <t hangText="oauth_token">
              <vspace />
              The temporary credentials identifier.
            </t>
            <t hangText="oauth_token_secret">
              <vspace />
              The temporary credentials shared-secret.
            </t>
            <t hangText="oauth_callback_confirmed:">
              MUST be present and set to <spanx style="verb">true</spanx>. The parameter is used
              to differentiate from previous versions of the protocol.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that even though the parameter names include the term 'token', these credentials are
          not token credentials, but are used in the next two steps in a similar manner to token
          credentials.

      <section title="Resource Owner Authorization" anchor="auth_step2">
        <t>
          Before the client requests a set of token credentials from the server, it MUST send
          the user to the server to authorize the request. The client constructs a request URI by
          adding the following query parameters to the Resource Owner Authorization endpoint URI:

          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
            <t hangText="oauth_token">
              <vspace />
              REQUIRED. The temporary credentials identifier obtained in <xref target="auth_step1" />
              in the <spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> parameter. Servers MAY declare this
              parameter as OPTIONAL, in which case they MUST provide a way for the resource owner
              to indicate the identifier through other means.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Servers MAY specify additional parameters.">
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an HTTP redirection
          response, or by other means available to it via the resource owner's user agent. The
          request MUST use the HTTP <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx> method.
        </t>
        <t>
          The way in which the server handles the authorization request is beyond the scope of this
          specification. However, the server MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner.
        </t>
        <t>
          When asking the resource owner to authorize the requested access, the server SHOULD
          present to the resource owner information about the client requesting access based on the
          association of the temporary credentials with the client identity. When displaying any
          such information, the server SHOULD indicate if the information has been verified.
        </t>
        <t>
          After receiving an authorization decision from the resource owner, the server redirects
          the resource owner to the callback URI if one was provided in the
          <spanx style="verb">oauth_callback</spanx> parameter or by other means.
        </t>
        <t>
          To make sure that the resource owner granting access is the same resource owner returning
          back to the client to complete the process, the server MUST generate a verification code:
          an unguessable value passed to the client via the resource owner and REQUIRED to complete
          the process. The server constructs the request URI by adding the following parameter to the
          callback URI query component:

          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
            <t hangText="oauth_token">
              <vspace />
              The temporary credentials identifier received from the client.
            </t>
            <t hangText="oauth_verifier:">
              The verification code.
            </t>
          </list>

          If the callback URI already includes a query component, the server MUST append the
          OAuth parameters to the end of the existing query.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>

]]>
					</artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          If the client did not provide a callback URI, the server SHOULD display the value of the
          verification code, and instruct the resource owner to manually inform the client that
          authorization is completed. If the server knows a client to be running on a limited device
          it SHOULD ensure that the verifier value is suitable for manual entry.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Token Credentials" anchor="auth_step3">
        <t>
          The client obtains a set of token credentials from the server by making an
          <xref target="requests">authenticated</xref> HTTP <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>
          request to the Token Request endpoint (unless the server advertises another HTTP

        <t>
          When making the request, the client authenticates using the client credentials as well as

        <t>
          Once the client receives the token credentials, it can proceed to access protected
          resources on behalf of the resource owner by making
          <xref target="requests">authenticated request</xref> using the client credentials and the
          token credentials received.
        </t>

    <section title="Authenticated Requests" anchor="requests">
      <t>
        The HTTP authentication methods defined by <xref target="RFC2617" />, enable clients
        to make authenticated HTTP requests. Clients using these methods gain access to protected
        resources by using their credentials (typically a username and password pair), which
        allows the server to verify their authenticity. Using these methods for delegation requires
        the client to assume the role of the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth provides a method designed to include two sets of credentials with each request, one
        to identify the client, and another to identify the resource owner. Before a client can
        make authenticated requests on behalf of the resource owner, it must obtain a token
        authorized by the resource owner. <xref target="redirect_workflow" /> provides one such
        method through which the client can obtain a token authorized by the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client credentials take the form of a unique identifier, and an associated shared-secret
        or RSA key pair. Prior to making authenticated requests, the client establishes a set of
        credentials with the server. The process and requirements for provisioning these are
        outside the scope of this specification. Implementers are urged to consider the security
        ramifications of using client credentials, some of which are described in
        <xref target="client_cred_sec" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        Making authenticated requests requires prior knowledge of the server's configuration.
        OAuth includes multiple methods for transmitting protocol parameters with requests
				(<xref target="param_include" />), as well as multiple methods for the client to
        prove its rightful ownership of the credentials used (<xref target="signature" />).
        The way in which clients discover the required configuration is outside the scope of
        this specification.
      </t>

      <section title="Making Requests">
        <t>
          Clients make authenticated requests by calculating a set of protocol parameters and add
          them to the HTTP request as follows:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              Each of the protocol parameters listed in <xref target="protocol_params" /> except
              for <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> is assigned a value based on its
              definition. All the parameters MUST be included, except for
              <spanx style="verb">oauth_version</spanx> which MAY be omitted, and
              <spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> which MUST be omitted when making a temporary
              credentials request (<xref target="auth_step1" />).
            </t>
            <t>
              The protocol parameters are added to the request using one of the transmission
              methods listed in <xref target="param_include" />.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client calculates and assigns the value of the <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx>
              parameter as described in <xref target="signature" /> and adds the parameter to the
              request using the same method used in the previous step.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client sends the authenticated HTTP request to the server.

          Clients should avoid making assumptions about the size of tokens and other
          server-generated values, which are left undefined by this specification. In addition,
          protocol parameters MAY include values which require encoding when transmitted. Clients
          and servers should not make assumptions about the possible range of their values.

        <section title="Nonce and Timestamp" anchor="nonce">
          <t>
            The timestamp value MUST be a positive integer. Unless otherwise specified by the
            server's documentation, the timestamp is expressed in the number of seconds since
            January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.
          </t>
          <t>
            A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated by the client to allow the server to
            verify that a request has never been made before and helps prevent replay attacks when
            requests are made over a non-secure channel. The nonce value MUST be unique across all
            requests with the same timestamp, client credentials, and token combinations.
          </t>
          <t>
            To avoid the need to retain an infinite number of nonce values for future checks, servers
            MAY choose to restrict the time period after which a request with an old timestamp is
            rejected. Servers applying such a restriction SHOULD provide a way for the client to sync
            its clock with the server's clock, which is beyond the scope of this specification.

      <section title="Signature" anchor="signature">
        <t>
					OAuth-authenticated requests can have two sets of credentials: those passed via the
					<spanx style="verb">oauth_consumer_key</spanx> parameter and those in the
					<spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> parameter. In order for the server to
          verify the authenticity of the request and prevent unauthorized access, the client needs
          to prove that it is the rightful owner of the credentials. This is accomplished using the
          shared-secret (or RSA key) part of each set of credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          OAuth provides three methods for the client to prove its rightful ownership of the
          credentials: <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>,
          and <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx>. These methods are generally referred to as
          signature methods, even though <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx> does not involve a
          signature. In addition, <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> utilizes an RSA key instead
          of the shared-secrets associated with the client credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          OAuth does not mandate a particular signature method, as each implementation can have its
          own unique requirements. Servers are free to implement and document their own custom
          methods. Recommending any particular method is beyond the scope of this specification.
          Implementers should review the <xref target="Security">Security Considerations section</xref>
          before deciding on which method to support.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client declares which signature method is used via the
          <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature_method</spanx> parameter. It then generates a signature
          (or a string of an equivalent value), and includes it in the
          <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter. The server verifies the signature
          as specified for each method.
        </t>
        <t>
          The signature process does not change the request or its parameter, with the exception of
          the <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter.
        </t>

        <section title="Signature Base String">
          <t>
            The signature base string is a consistent, reproducible concatenation of several
            of the HTTP request elements into a single string. The string is used as an input to
            the <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>
            signature methods.
          </t>
          <t>
            The signature base string includes the following components of the HTTP request:
            
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                The HTTP request method (e.g. <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx>,

              </t>

          </t>
          <t>
            The signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request. Most notably, it
            does not include the entity-body in most requests, nor does it include most HTTP
            entity-headers. It is important to note that the server cannot verify the authenticity
            of the excluded request components without using additional protections such as SSL/TLS or
            other methods.

          Authenticated requests made with <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> signatures do not
          use the token shared-secret, or any provisioned client shared-secret. This means the request

          When used with the <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx> method, the protocol makes no
          attempt to protect credentials from eavesdroppers or man-in-the-middle attacks. The

      <section title="Confidentiality of Requests">
        <t>
          While this protocol provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of requests, it
          provides no guarantee of request confidentiality. Unless further precautions are taken,
          eavesdroppers will have full access to request content. Servers should carefully consider
          the kinds of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and should employ
          transport-layer security mechanisms to protect sensitive resources.

      <section title="Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers">
        <t>
          This protocol makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the server. A hostile party
          could take advantage of this by intercepting the client's requests and returning
          misleading or otherwise incorrect responses. Service providers should consider such
          attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should require transport-layer
          security for any requests where the authenticity of the server or of request responses is
          an issue.

      </section>

      <section title="Proxying and Caching of Authenticated Content">
        <t>
          The <xref target="auth_header">HTTP Authorization scheme</xref> is optional. However,
          <xref target="RFC2616" /> relies on the <spanx style="verb">Authorization</spanx> and
          <spanx style="verb">WWW-Authenticate</spanx> headers to distinguish authenticated content
          so that it can be protected. Proxies and caches, in particular, may fail to adequately
          protect requests not using these headers.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, private authenticated content may be stored in (and thus retrievable from)
          publicly-accessible caches. Servers not using the
          <xref target="auth_header">HTTP Authorization header</xref> should take care to use other
          mechanisms, such as the <spanx style="verb">Cache-Control</spanx> header, to ensure that
          authenticated content is protected.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Plaintext Storage of Credentials">
        <t>
          The client shared-secret and token shared-secret function the same way passwords do in
          traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the signatures used in methods
          other than <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>, the server must have access to these
          secrets in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems,
          which store only a one-way hash of user credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          If an attacker were to gain access to these secrets - or worse, to the server's database
          of all such secrets - he or she would be able to perform any action on behalf of any
          resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these secrets from
          unauthorized access.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Secrecy of the Client Credentials" anchor="client_cred_sec">
        <t>
          In many cases, the client application will be under the control of potentially untrusted
          parties. For example, if the client is a freely available desktop application, an
          attacker may be able to download a copy for analysis. In such cases, attackers will be
          able to recover the client credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          Accordingly, servers should not use the client credentials alone to verify the identity
          of the client. Where possible, other factors such as IP address should be used as well.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Phishing Attacks">
        <t>
          Wide deployment of this and similar protocols may cause resource owners to become inured
          to the practice of being redirected to websites where they are asked to enter their
          passwords. If resource owners are not careful to verify the authenticity of these
          websites before entering their credentials, it will be possible for attackers to exploit
          this practice to steal resource owners' passwords.
        </t>
        <t>
          Servers should attempt to educate resource owners about the risks phishing attacks pose,
          and should provide mechanisms that make it easy for resource owners to confirm the
          authenticity of their sites.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scoping of Access Requests">
        <t>
          By itself, this protocol does not provide any method for scoping the access rights
          granted to a client. However, most applications do require greater granularity of access
          rights. For example, servers may wish to make it possible to grant access to some
          protected resources but not others, or to grant only limited access (such as read-only
          access) to those protected resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          When implementing this protocol, servers should consider the types of access resource
          owners may wish to grant clients, and should provide mechanisms to do so. Servers should
          also take care to ensure that resource owners understand the access they are granting, as
          well as any risks that may be involved.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Entropy of Secrets">
        <t>
          Unless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access
          to authenticated requests and signatures, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force
          attacks to recover the credentials used. Servers should be careful to assign
          shared-secrets which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at
          least the length of time that the shared-secrets are valid.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, if shared-secrets are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is
          not possible to mount a brute force attack that recovers the shared-secret in less than
          two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the longest
          secrets reasonable.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate
          these secrets be of sufficiently high quality. Many PRNG implementations generate number
          sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit patterns or other
          weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be
          careful to use cryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion Attacks">
        <t>
          This specification includes a number of features which may make resource exhaustion
          attacks against servers possible. For example, this protocol requires servers to track
          used nonces. If an attacker is able to use many nonces quickly, the resources required to
          track them may exhaust available capacity. And again, this protocol can require servers
          to perform potentially expensive computations in order to verify the signature on
          incoming requests. An attacker may exploit this to perform a denial of service attack by
          sending a large number of invalid requests to the server.
        </t>
        <t>
          Resource Exhaustion attacks are by no means specific to this specification. However,
          implementers should be careful to consider the additional avenues of attack that this
          protocol exposes, and design their implementations accordingly. For example, entropy
          starvation typically results in either a complete denial of service while the system
          waits for new entropy or else in weak (easily guessable) secrets. When implementing this
          protocol, servers should consider which of these presents a more serious risk for their
          application and design accordingly.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Cryptographic Attacks">
        <t>
          SHA-1, the hash algorithm used in <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> signatures, has
          been <xref target="SHA1-CHARACTERISTICS">shown</xref> to have a number of cryptographic
          weaknesses that significantly reduce its resistance to collision attacks. Practically
          speaking, these weaknesses are difficult to exploit, and by themselves do not pose a
          significant risk to users of this protocol. They may, however, make more efficient attacks
          possible, and NIST has <xref target="SHA-COMMENTS">announced</xref> that it will phase
          out use of SHA-1 by 2010. Servers should take this into account when considering whether
          SHA-1 provides an adequate level of security for their applications.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Signature Base String Limitations">
        <t>
          The signature base string has been designed to support the signature methods defined in
          this specification. Those designing additional signature methods, should evaluated the
          compatibility of the signature base string with their security requirements.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since the signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request, such as most
          request entity-body, most entity-headers, and the order in which parameters are sent,
          servers should employ additional mechanisms to protect such elements.
        </t>
      </section>

			<section title="Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)">
				<t>
					Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a web-based attack whereby HTTP requests are
          transmitted from a user that the website trusts or has authenticated. CSRF attacks on
          authorization approvals can allow an attacker to obtain authorization to protected
          resources without the consent of the User. Servers SHOULD strongly consider best
          practices in CSRF prevention at all the protocol authorization endpoints.
				</t>
				<t>
					CSRF attacks on OAuth callback URIs hosted by client are also possible. Clients should
          prevent CSRF attacks on OAuth callback URIs by verifying that the resource owner at the
          client site intended to complete the OAuth negotiation with the server. The methods for
          preventing such CSRF attacks are beyond the scope of this specification.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="User Interface Redress">
				<t>
					Servers should protect the authorization process against UI Redress attacks (also known
          as "clickjacking"). As of the time of this writing, no complete defenses against UI
          redress are available. Servers can mitigate the risk of UI redress attacks through the
          following techniques:

					<list style="symbols">
						<t>
              Javascript frame busting.
            </t>
						<t>
              Javascript frame busting, and requiring that browsers have javascript enabled on the
              authorization page.
            </t>
						<t>
              Browser-specific anti-framing techniques.
            </t>
						<t>
              Requiring password reentry before issuing OAuth tokens.
            </t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Automatic Processing of Repeat Authorizations">
				<t>
					Servers may wish to automatically process authorization requests
					(<xref target="auth_step2" />) from clients which have been previously
					authorized by the resource owner. When the resource owner is redirected to the server
					to grant access, the server detects that the resource owner has already granted
					access to that particular client. Instead of prompting the resource owner for approval,
					the server automatically redirects the resource owner back to the client.
				</t>
				<t>
					If the client credentials are compromised, automatic processing creates additional
					security risks. An attacker can use the stolen client credentials to redirect
					the resource owner to the server with an authorization request. The server
					will then grant access to the resource owner's data without the resource owner's
					explicit approval, or even awareness of an attack. If no automatic approval is
					implemented, an attacker must use social engineering to convince the resource owner to
					approve access.
				</t>
				<t>
					Servers can mitigate the risks associated with automatic processing by
					limiting the scope of token credentials obtained through automated approvals. Tokens
					credentials obtained through explicit resource owner consent can remain unaffected. clients
					can mitigate the risks associated with automatic processing by protecting their client
					credentials.

		<appendix title="Differences from the Community Edition">
			<t>
				This specification includes the following changes made to the original community document
				in order to correct mistakes and omissions identified since the document has been published:
				
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						Adjusted nonce language to indicate it is unique per token/timestamp/client combination.
					</t>
          <t>
            Removed the requirement for timestamps to be equal to or greater than the timestamp
            used in the previous request.
          </t>
					<t>
						Extended signature base string coverage which includes <spanx style="verb">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx>
						entity-body parameters when the HTTP method used is other than <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx> and URI query
						parameters when the HTTP method used is other than <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx>.
					</t>
					<t>
						Added requirement to normalize empty request URI paths as <spanx style="verb">/</spanx>.
					</t>
					<t>
						Incorporated corrections to the instructions in each signature method to encode the signature
            value before inserting it into the <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter,
            removing errors which would have caused double-encoded values.

    <appendix title="Acknowledgments">
      <t>
        This specification is directly based on the OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A community
        specification which in turn was modeled after existing proprietary protocols and best
        practices that have been independently implemented by various companies.
      </t>
      <t>
        The community specification was edited by Eran Hammer-Lahav and authored by: Mark Atwood,
        Dirk Balfanz, Darren Bounds, Richard M. Conlan, Blaine Cook, Leah Culver,
        Breno de Medeiros, Brian Eaton, Kellan Elliott-McCrea, Larry Halff, Eran Hammer-Lahav,
        Ben Laurie, Chris Messina, John Panzer, Sam Quigley, David Recordon, Eran Sandler,
        Jonathan Sergent, Todd Sieling, Brian Slesinsky, and Andy Smith.
      </t>
      <t>
        The editor would like to thank the following individuals for their invaluable contribution
        to the publication of this edition of the protocol: Lisa Dusseault, Avshalom Houri,
        Mark Nottingham, and Peter Saint-Andre.

            Clarified that all 'oauth_' parameters must be transmitted using the same method.

          <t>
            Added explicit requirement to exclude parameters not transmitted in a request in the

          <t>
            Rearranged the signature base string section to provide a better narrative of how the
            HTTP request is normalized. Added the protocol parameters to the examples to better
            demonstrate how they are incorporated in practice.

            Flipped the document order between authentication and authorization.

            Initial draft based on the OAuth Core 1.0 community specification
            with the following changes.
          </t>
          <t>
            Various changes required to accommodate the strict format requirements of the IETF,
            such as moving sections around (Security, Contributors, Introduction, etc.), cleaning
            references, adding IETF specific text, etc.
          </t>
          <t>
            Moved the Parameter Encoding sub-section from section 5 (Parameters) to section 9.1
            (Signature Base String) to make it clear it only applies to the signature base string.
          </t>
          <t>
            Nonce language adjusted to indicate it is unique per token/timestamp/consumer
            combination.
          </t>
          <t>
            Added security language regarding lack of token secrets in RSA-SHA1.
          </t>
          <t>
            Fixed the bug in the Normalize Request Parameters section. Removed the
            <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx> limitation from the third bullet (query parameters).
          </t>
          <t>
            Removed restriction of only signing application/x-www-form-urlencoded in
            <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx> requests, allowing the entity-body to be used with all
            HTTP request methods.

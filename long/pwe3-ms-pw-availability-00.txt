      Multi-Segment Pseudowire Signaling with Availability Information 
                 draft-long-pwe3-ms-pw-availability-00.txt 


Abstract 

   This document describes a signaling mechanism for setting up a multi-
   segment pseudowire between different domains in case that at least 
   one domain has the feature that bandwidth capacity is variable for 
   different availability values. The signaling mechanism is an 
   extension on the multi-segment pseudowire signaling [DYN-MS-PW].

1. Introduction 

   [RFC5659] describes the architecture of multi-segment pseudowire. The 
   LDP signaling mechanism for setting up multi-segement pseudowire is 
   described by [DYN-MS-PW]. The mechanism introduces a pseudowire 
   bandwidth TLV for PSN tunnel selection.  

   In many scenarios, a network may contain some non-fixed-bandwidth 
   links. For example, the radio links may change their interface rates 
   due to rain, fog, etc. The DSL links may change their interface rates 
   due to external interference. The pair of <availability, bandwidth> 
   is often used to describe the bandwidth capacity of the links during 
   network planning. In this case, A LSP across the links will include 
   multiple bandwidth portions with different availability guarantee. As 
   the result, only PW bandwidth requirement information is not enough 
   for the multi-segment pseudowire setup. 

   An optional PW availability TLV is introduced in this document for 
   providing enough information for S-PE to selecting PSN tunnel.

                       Figure 1 PW Availability TLV 

   The optional availability TLV described by Figure 1 is 32-bit 
   floating point number which is smaller than 1. This field describes 
   the availability requirement for the multi-segment pseudowire which 
   is inherited from the availability requirement of the emulated 
   service. 

   When an S/T-PE receives a PW availability TLV and a PW bandwidth TLV, 
   it will search for an PSN tunnel which can satisfy the bandwidth 
   requirement with the availability requirement. Once the PW next hop 
   is selected, the S/T-PE MUST request the appropriate resources which 
   can guarantee the required availability from the PSN. 

   In the case where PSN resources towards the previous hop are not   
   available the following procedure MUST be followed: 

     -i. The PSN MAY allocate more QoS resources, e.g. Bandwidth with 
   required availability guranttee, to the PSN tunnel. 
     -ii. The S-PE MAY attempt to setup another PSN tunnel to             
   accommodate the new PW QoS requirements. 
      -iii. If the S-PE cannot get enough resources to setup the segment        
   in the MS-PW a label release MUST be returned to the previous hop 
   with a status message of "Bandwidth resources unavailable" 

   In the latter case, the T-PE receiving the status message MUST also 
   withdraw the corresponding PW label mapping for the opposite   
   direction if it has already been successfully setup. 

3. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce new security considerations.

                  Using OAuth for Recursive Delegation
                  draft-vrancken-oauth-redelegation-01

Abstract

   This document describes a use case for delegating authorization by a
   Resource Owner to another user via a Client using the OAuth protocol.
   OAuth allows Clients to access server resources on behalf of another
   party (such as a different Client or an end-user).  This document
   describes the use of OAuth for delegating one Client's authorization
   to another Client - a scenario, which is also known as four-legged
   authorization.

Internet-Draft    Using OAuth for Recursive Delegation     February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The need for documenting a use case for the OAuth multi-layered
   authorization was discussed on the OAuth mailing list and at the bar
   BoF meeting at the IETF 75.  This Internet Draft describes such a use
   case.  We propose this document as a work item of the OAuth working
   group.  Depending on the group's decision it can become a part of
   another Internet Draft or a separate document.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Use of the OAuth protocol for re-delegation of the access rights for
    a protected resource

   The OAuth protocol provides a method for servers to allow third-party
   access to protected resources without forcing their end-users to
   reveal their authentication credentials.  This method can be employed
   to support organizing and sharing information among the end-users.

   For example, a Web user (Resource Owner) can grant data access to a
   pre-defined set of users.  This can be done with the use of a special
   OAuth Client - content manager - which serves as a proxy between the
   end-users and the Web servers that host the resources related to the
   project.  The content manager allows a user (the owner of the
   resources) to specify a set of the resources related to a project
   (e.g., by tagging) and a set of the users and their access rights in
   respect to the resources.  The content manager may also enable
   searching of the related materials.

   The methods for managing user information are out of the scope of
   this document.  The document describes how such content manager
   authorizes user access to the resources using the OAuth protocol.

   As far as authorization is concerned, the content manager and the
   user with whom the Resource Owner shares a resource are the OAuth
   Clients as defined in [draft-ietf-oauth-authentication].  In this
   document the content manager, which has been authorized by a Resource
   Owner to share a resource with a user is called first Client.  The
   user with whom the resource is to be shared is referred to as a
   second Client.

   This document describes the use of OAuth for enabling sharing a

   resource under the following scenario:

   o  First Client has been authorized by the Resource Owner, to share a
      resource (e.g., file) with a second Client.

   o  The first Client has obtained access token credentials for the
      resource.

   o  The first Client enables the second Client to access the resource
      without getting the Resource Owner involved in authorization
      process.

3.1.  Redirection-Based Authorization

   OAuth uses a set of token credentials to represent the authorization
   granted to the Client by the Resource Owner.  Typically, token
   credentials are issued by the Server at the Resource Owner's request,
   after authenticating the Resource Owner's identity using its Server
   credentials (usually a username and password pair).

   The specification [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation] defines a method
   for provisioning the token credentials with the use of the HTTP
   redirection and the Resource Owner's user agent.  This document
   describes how the method can be expanded to allow a Client to share a
   resource with another Client after obtaining the Resource Owner's
   authorization to do so.

   The specification [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation] defines the
   following URIs of a Web Server:

   o  Temporary Credential Request

   o  Resource Owner Authorization

   o  Token Request

   It also defines the HTTP methods (GET,POST, etc.) used to make the
   requests.  This specification relies on these definitions.

   The method in which the server advertises its three endpoints is
   beyond the scope of [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation] and this
   document.

3.2.  The Resource Owner authorizes a first Client to share a resource

   In the initial stage of the authorization procedure, the Resource
   Owner authorizes a Client to share the resource with another user(who
   is just another Client in terms of

   [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation]).

   The first Client obtains (after the Resource Owner's authorization)
   token credentials that allow it to access (e.g., read, update) the
   resource.  In the described use case the access rights include a
   right to re-delegate (i.e., to proxy) the obtained authorization.
   The first Client, which does not need to access the resource, will
   use the credentials for authenticating to the Server and authorizing
   access by the second Client.

   The first Client obtains token credentials using a mechanism
   specified in [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation].  The steps that
   follow are illustrated by Figure 1 below and described in the next
   section.

3.3.  The first Client authorizes access to the resource by the second
      Client

   This section describes the steps of the procedure that follow the
   initial steps:

   o  Resource Owner has requested the first Client to share a resource
      with another user - a second Client

   o  The first Client has obtained the token credentials from the
      Server for the resource.

   Figure 1 - Authorization by the first Client of the second Client to
                        obtain access to a resource

   1.   The first Client notifies the second Client that a resource
        available for sharing on the server.  The first client MUST
        provide full path URL to the resource on the Web server.

   2.   The second client requests access to the resource.

   3.   The Web server responds with 401 HTTP error code denying access
        to the protected resource.

   4.   The second client establishes oauth_consumer_key and a shared
        secret - the client credentials - as specified in
        [draft-ietf-oauth-authentication].

   5.   The second Client requests temporary credentials as specified in
        [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation].

   6.   The second client receives from the Web server the temporary
        credentials.

   7.   The second Client asks the first Client to grant access to the
        requested resource on the Web server.

           After this step the first Client authenticates itself to the
           Web server and authorizes (or denies) access to the resource
           by the second Client.  To demonstrate that it has been
           authorized by the Resource Owner to access the resource, the
           first Client uses its token credentials obtained as a result
           of the usual OAuth procedure.  To do that, the first Client
           forms a request to the Web Server for the protected resource
           as specified in [draft-ietf- oauth-authentication] and
           [draft-ietf-oauth-delegation] with a modification.  The
           purpose of the required modification is to inform the Web
           Server that the first Client intends to use its token
           credentials for proving that it is authorized by the Resource
           Owner to access the resource and for authorizing access by
           another party, but not for getting the resource itsef.

   8.   After the first Client has authorized access to the resource for
        the second Client, the Web server sends a URL containing the
        oauth_token and oauth_verifier parameters as specified in
        [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation].

           After this step the first client responds back to the second
           client, confirming that the authorization has been done.

   9.   The second Client requests the token credentials (specified in
        [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation]).

   10.  The Web server responds with the token credentials.

   11.  The second Client requests access to the protected resource as
        specified in [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation].

   12.  After verification the Web Server satisfies the request.


4.  Multi-layered delegation of authorization

   Section 3 describes how one Client (i.e., first Client) can grant
   access to a resource to another Client (i.e., second Client).  The
   described method can be extended for granting access by the Nth
   Client to a client N+1.  In such a scenario each Client has to have a
   list of all Clients that are permitted to access the resource.

   Indeed, the second Client, after obtaining authorization from the
   first Client, can notify a third Client (assuming that it is on the
   list) of the intent to share the resource (as did the first Client in
   step 1).  Then by repeating the rest of the procedure described in
   section 3, the third Client can obtain authorization to the resource.
   The procedure can be repeated N times resulting in the recursive
   delegation of authorization.

   In general, the procedure allows a Client N+1 to demonstrate to the
   Web server that it has been authorized by an Nth Client to access the
   resource.  Before making authorization the Nth Client MUST verify
   that the Client N+1 is on the list of the Clients that are permitted
   to access the resource.


5.  Security Considerations

   As stated in [RFC2617], the greatest sources of risks are usually
   found not in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures
   surrounding its use.  Implementers are strongly encouraged to assess
   how this protocol addresses their security requirements.  Because of
   the nature of multi-layer delegation, the same security
   considerations are applicable as in the single-layer delegation
   [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation].

5.1.  Unlimited recursive delegation

   Resource owners should be able to decide if the client may use
   recursive delegation.  Clients should inform the Resource Owner, at

   who they would delegate permissions to.  A client may not delegate
   recursively to anyone else than permitted by the user.  The resource
   owner should only allow trustworthy clients to do the recursive
   delegation.  The Resource Owner should be able to track all the
   transactions to the protected resource from the different the
   clients/users.  Resource owners should be able to complain about
   clients that abuse this trust at the server.

5.2.  Phishing Attack

   Security considerations related to the phishing attack are described
   in [draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This Internet Draft includes no request to IANA.

Appendix A.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document as defined in [draft-
   ietf-oauth-authentication]:

   Client
      An HTTP client (per [RFC2616]) capable of making OAuth-
      authenticated requests per [draft-ietf-oauth-authentication].

   Server
      An HTTP server (per [RFC2616]) capable of accepting OAuth-
      authenticated requests per [draft-ietf-oauth-authentication].

   Protected Resource
      An access-restricted resource (per [RFC2616]) which can be
      obtained from the server using an OAuth-authenticated request per
      [draft-ietf-oauth-authentication].

   Resource Owner
      An entity capable of accessing and controlling protected resources
      by using credentials to authenticate with the server.

   Token
      An unique identifier issued by the server and used by the client
      to associate authenticated requests with the resource owner whose
      authorization is requested or has been obtained by the client.
      Tokens have a matching shared-secret that is used by the client to
      establish its ownership of the token, and its authority to
      represent the Resource Owner.

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   first Client
      A Client that has been authorized to access a Protected Resource
      by the Resource Owner.

   second Client
      A Client that has been authorized to access a Protected Resource
      by the First Client.

Appendix B.  Other examples

   A Resource Owner delegates the access rights on the photographs to a
   printing service via a content manager.  Even if the photographs are
   stored on the different Web servers, the content manager enables the
   printing service to access them without forcing the Resource Owner to
   repeat the authorization procedure.

<abstract>

<t>This memo defines an extension to the Network News Transport
  Protocol (NNTP) to allow a connection to be effectively and
  efficiently compressed.</t>

</abstract>
</front>


<middle>
<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

<t>The goal of COMPRESS is to reduce the bandwidth usage of NNTP.</t>

<t>Compared to PPP compression <xref target="RFC1962"/> and
  modem-based compression (<xref target="MNP"/> and
  <xref target="V42bis"/>), COMPRESS offers greater compression
  efficiency.  COMPRESS can be used together with Transport Layer
  Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246"/>, Simple Authentication and
  Security Layer (SASL) encryption <xref target="RFC4422"/>, Virtual
  Private Networks (VPNs), etc.</t>

<t>Compared to TLS compression
  <xref target="RFC3749"/>, NNTP COMPRESS has the following
  advantages:

<list style="symbols">
<t>COMPRESS can be implemented easily both by NNTP servers and
  clients.</t>

<t>COMPRESS benefits from an intimate knowledge of the NNTP
  protocol's state machine, allowing for dynamic and aggressive
  optimization of the underlying compression algorithm's
  parameters.</t>
</list></t>

<t>and the following disadvantages:

<list style="symbols">
<t>When the TLS layer implements compression, any protocol using that
  layer can transparently benefit from that compression (e.g., SMTP
  and NNTP).  COMPRESS is specific to NNTP.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In order to increase interoperability, it is desirable to have as
   few different compression algorithms as possible, so this document
   specifies only one.  The DEFLATE algorithm (defined in
   <xref target="RFC1951"/>) is standard, widely available and fairly
   efficient, and MUST be implemented as part of this extension.</t>

<!--
<t>In order to increase interoperability, NNTP servers that advertise
  this extension SHOULD also support the TLS DEFLATE compression  
  mechanism as defined in <xref target="RFC3749"/>.  NNTP clients MAY
  use either COMPRESS or TLS compression, however, if the client and
  server support both, it is RECOMMENDED that the client choose TLS
  compression.</t>
-->

<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">

<t>The notational conventions used in this document are the same as
  those in <xref target="RFC3977"/> and any term not defined in this
  document has the same meaning as in that one.</t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in
  <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>In the examples, commands from the client are indicated with [C],
  and responses from the server are indicated with [S].</t>

<section title="The COMPRESS Extension" anchor="compressext">

<t>The COMPRESS extension is used to enable data compression on an
  NNTP connection.</t>

<t>This extension provides a new COMPRESS command and has capability
  label COMPRESS.</t>

<section title="Advertising the COMPRESS Extension" anchor="advertising">

<t>A server supporting the COMPRESS command as defined in this
  document will advertise the "COMPRESS" capability label in response
  to the CAPABILITIES command (<xref target="RFC3977"/> Section
  5.2).  This capability MAY be advertised both before and after any
  use of the MODE READER command (<xref target="RFC3977"/> Section
  5.3), with the same semantics.</t>

<t>The COMPRESS capability label contains a whitespace-separated list
  of available compression algorithms.  This document defines one
  compression algorithm: DEFLATE.  This algorithm is mandatory to
  implement and MUST be supported in order to advertise the COMPRESS
  extension.</t>

<t>Future extensions may add additional compression algorithms to this
  capability.  Unrecognized algorithms MUST be ignored by the
  client.</t>

Parameters

</artwork>
</figure>
</section> <!-- usage -->
<section title="Description" anchor="description">

<t>The COMPRESS command instructs the server to use the named
  compression algorithm ("DEFLATE" is the only one defined in this
  document) for all commands and/or responses after COMPRESS.</t>

<t>The client MUST NOT send any further commands until it has seen the
   result of COMPRESS.</t>

<t>If the requested compression algorithm is invalid (e.g., is not
   supported), the server MUST reject the COMPRESS command with a 503
   response (<xref target="RFC3977"/> Section 3.2.1).  If the
   server is unable to activate compression for any reason (e.g., a
   server configuration or resource problem), the server MUST reject
   the COMPRESS command with a 403 response (<xref target="RFC3977"/>
   Section 3.2.1).  Otherwise, the server issues a 291 response and
   the compression layer takes effect for both client and server
   immediately following the CRLF of the success reply.</t>

<t>Both the client and the server MUST know if there is a compression
  layer active.  A client MUST NOT attempt to activate compression
  (via either the COMPRESS or STARTTLS <xref target="RFC4642"/>
  commands) if a compression layer is already active.  A server MUST
  NOT return the COMPRESS or STARTTLS capability labels in response to
  a CAPABILITIES command received after a compression layer is active,
  and a server MUST reply with a 502 response code if a syntactically
  valid COMPRESS or STARTTLS command is received while a compression
  layer is already active.</t>

<t>For DEFLATE <xref target="RFC1951"/> (as for many other compression
  mechanisms), the compressor can trade speed against quality.  The
  decompressor MUST automatically adjust to the parameters selected by
  the sender. Consequently, the client and server are both free to
  pick the best reasonable rate of compression for the data they
  send.</t>

<t>When COMPRESS is combined with TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>
  or SASL <xref target="RFC4422"/> security layers, the processing
  order of the three layers MUST be first COMPRESS, then SASL, and
  finally TLS.  That is, before data is transmitted it is first
  compressed.  Second, if a SASL security layer has been negotiated,
  the compressed data is then signed and/or encrypted accordingly.
  Third, if a TLS security layer has been negotiated, the data from
  the previous step is signed and/or encrypted accordingly.  When
  receiving data, the processing order MUST be reversed.  This ensures
  that before sending, data is compressed before it is encrypted,
  independent of the order in which the client issues the COMPRESS,
  AUTHINFO SASL <xref target="RFC4643"/>, and STARTTLS
  <xref target="RFC4642"/> commands.</t>

<section title="Compression Efficiency" anchor="efficiency">

<t>This section is only informative.</t>

<t>NNTP poses some unusual problems for a compression layer.</t>

<t>Upstream traffic is fairly simple.  Most NNTP clients send the same
  few commands again and again, so any compression algorithm that can 
  exploit repetition works efficiently.  The article posting and
  transfer commands (e.g., POST, IHAVE, and TAKETHIS
  <xref target="RFC4644"/>) are an exception; clients that send many
  article posting or transfer commands may want to surround large
  multi-line data blocks with flushes in the same way as is
  recommended for servers later in this section.</t>

<t>Downstream traffic has the unusual property that several kinds of
  data are sent, confusing all dictionary-based compression
  algorithms.</t>

<t>One type is NNTP simple responses and NNTP multi-line responses not
   related to article header/body retrieval (e.g, CAPABILITIES, GROUP,
   NEXT, STAT, DATE, NEWNEWS, LIST, OVER, CHECK
   <xref target="RFC4644"/>, etc).  These are highly compressible;
   zlib using its least CPU-intensive setting compresses typical
   responses to 25-40% of their original size.</t>

<t>Another type is article headers (as retrieved via the HEAD or
   ARTICLE commands).  These are equally compressible, and benefit
   from using the same dictionary as the NNTP responses.</t>

<t>A third type is article body text (as retrieved via the BODY or
   ARTICLE commands).  Text is usually fairly short and includes much
   ASCII, so the same compression dictionary will do a good job here,
   too.  When multiple messages in the same thread are read at the
   same time, quoted lines, etc. can often be compressed almost to
   zero.</t>

<t>Finally, attachments (non-text article bodies retrieved via the
   BODY and ARTICLE commands) are transmitted in encoded form, usually
   Base64 <xref target="RFC4648"/>, UUencode
   <xref target="IEEE.1003-2.1992"/>, or yEnc
   <xref target="yEnc"/>.</t>

<t>When attachments are retrieved, DEFLATE may be able to compress
   them, but the format of the attachment's encoding is usually not
   NNTP-like, so the dictionary built while compressing NNTP does not 
   help.  The compressor has to adapt its dictionary from NNTP to the
   attachment's encoding format, and then back.  
<!--
    A few file formats aren't compressible at all using deflate, e.g.,
   .gz, .zip, and .jpg files.
-->
</t>

<t>When attachments are retrieved in Base64 or UUencode form, these
   encodings add another problem.  8-bit compression algorithms such
   as DEFLATE work well on 8-bit file formats, however both Base64 and
   UUencode transform a file into something resembling 6-bit bytes,
   hiding most of the 8-bit file format from the compressor.</t>

<t>When using the zlib library (see <xref target="RFC1951"/>), the
   functions deflateInit2(), deflate(), inflateInit2(), and inflate()
   suffice to implement this extension.  The windowBits value must be
   in the range -8 to -15, or else deflateInit2() uses the wrong
   format.  deflateParams() can be used to improve compression rate
   and resource use.  The Z_FULL_FLUSH argument to deflate() can be
   used to clear the dictionary (the receiving peer does not need to
   do anything).</t>

<t>A server can improve downstream compression if it hints to the
   compressor that the data type is about to change strongly, e.g., by
   sending a Z_FULL_FLUSH at the start and end of large non-text
   multi-line data blocks (before and after 'content-lines' in the
   definition of 'multi-line-data-block' in <xref target="RFC3977"/>
   Section 9.8).  Small multi-line data blocks are best left alone.  A
   possible boundary is 5kB.</t>

<!--
<t>A server can improve the CPU efficiency both of the server and the
   client if it adjusts the compression level (e.g., using the
   deflateParams() function in zlib) at these points, to avoid trying
   to compress incompressible attachments.  A very simple strategy is
   to change the level to 0 at the start of a multi-line data block
   provided the first two bytes are either 0x1F 0x8B (as in
   deflate-compressed files) or 0xFF 0xD8 (JPEG), and to keep it at
   1-5 the rest of the time.  More complex strategies are
   possible.</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<section title="NNTP Compression Algorithm Registry" anchor="compreg">

<t>The NNTP Compression Algorithm registry will be maintained by
  IANA.  The registry will be available at
  &lt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/nntp-compression-algorithms&gt;.</t>

<t>The purpose of this registry is not only to ensure uniqueness of
   values used to name NNTP compression algorithms, but also to
   provide a definitive reference to technical specifications
   detailing each NNTP compression algorithm available for use on the
   Internet.</t>

<t>There is no naming convention for NNTP compression algorithms; any
   name that conforms to the syntax of a NNTP compression algorithm
   name can be registered.</t>

<t>The procedure detailed in <xref target="regproc"/> is to be used
   for registration of a value naming a specific individual
   mechanism.</t>

<t>Comments may be included in the registry as discussed in
  <xref target="regcomments"/> and may be changed as discussed in
  <xref target="changecontrol"/>.</t>

<section title="Algorithm Name Registration Procedure"
  anchor="regproc">

<t>IANA will register new NNTP compression algorithm names on a First
   Come First Served basis, as defined in BCP 26
   <xref target="RFC5226"/>.  IANA has the right to reject obviously
   bogus registration requests, but will perform no review of claims
   made in the registration form.</t>

<t>Registration of an NNTP compression algorithm is requested by
   filling in the following template:

<figure>
<artwork>
Subject: Registration of NNTP compression algorithm X

Intended usage: (One of COMMON, LIMITED USE, or OBSOLETE)

Owner/Change controller:

Note: (Any other information that the author deems relevant may be
       added here.)
</artwork>
</figure>

and sending it via electronic mail to IANA at
&lt;iana@iana.org&gt;.</t>

<t>While this registration procedure does not require expert review,
   authors of NNTP compression algorithms are encouraged to seek
   community review and comment whenever that is feasible.  Authors
   may seek community review by posting a specification of their
   proposed mechanism as an Internet-Draft.  NNTP compression
   algorithms intended for widespread use should be standardized
   through the normal IETF process, when appropriate.</t>

</section> <!-- compreg -->

<section title="Comments on Algorithm Registrations"
  anchor="regcomments">

<t>Comments on a registered NNTP compression algorithm should first be
   sent to the "owner" of the algorithm and/or to the
   &lt;ietf-nntp@lists.eyrie.org&gt; mailing list.</t>

<t>Submitters of comments may, after a reasonable attempt to contact
   the owner, request IANA to attach their comment to the NNTP
   compression algorithm registration itself by sending mail to
   &lt;iana@iana.org&gt;.  At IANA's sole discretion, IANA may attach
   the comment to the NNTP compression algorithm's registration.</t>

</section> <!-- regcomments -->

<section title="Change Control" anchor="changecontrol">

<t>Once an NNTP compression algorithm registration has been published
   by IANA, the author may request a change to its definition.  The
   change request follows the same procedure as the registration
   request.</t>

<t>The owner of an NNTP compression algorithm may pass responsibility
   for the algorithm to another person or agency by informing IANA;
   this can be done without discussion or review.</t>

<t>The IESG may reassign responsibility for an NNTP compression
   algorithm.  The most common case of this will be to enable changes
   to be made to algorithms where the author of the registration has
   died, has moved out of contact, or is otherwise unable to make
   changes that are important to the community.</t>

<t>NNTP compression algorithm registrations may not be deleted;
   algorithms that are no longer believed appropriate for use can be
   declared OBSOLETE by a change to their "intended usage" field; such
   algorithms will be clearly marked in the lists published by
   IANA.</t>

<t>The IESG is considered to be the owner of all NNTP compression
   algorithms that are on the IETF standards track.</t>

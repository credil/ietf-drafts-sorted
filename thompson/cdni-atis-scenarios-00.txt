     ATIS Internet Sourced Content Initiative and Relevance to CDNI
                 draft-thompson-cdni-atis-scenarios-00

Abstract

   The ATIS IPTV Interoperability Forum (IIF) is a leading developer of
   requirements, standards, and specifications for Internet Protocol
   Television, or IPTV.  IIF has specified an architecture for Content
   On Demand applications which was published as the [ATIS-0800042] IPTV
   Content on Demand (CoD) Service specification.  ATIS IIF is now
   working on revision 2 of this document.  Revision 2 of ATIS CoD
   specification includes an additional work item called "Internet
   Sourced Content" which includes "off net delivery".  Both Internet
   Sourced Content and off net delivery will address scenarios that
   include delivery of content from a Content Service Provider through
   multiple CDNs operated by different organizations to a user agent.
   This document provides information on [ATIS-0800042], and the
   Internet Sourced Content and off net Delivery use cases that are
   relevant to CDNI.

   The ATIS IIF architecture group focuses on developing architectures
   and prefers to reference existing protocols where ever possible.  If,
   and as, the IETF CDNI effort progresses, the ATIS IIF architecture
   group will be evaluating the protocols defined by the CDNI working
   group for inclusion in the CDN interconnect scenarios defined as part
   of the Internet Sourced Content and off net Delivery use cases.

   A goal of the present document is to illustrate the Internet Sourced
   Content and off net Delivery use cases defined in revision 2 of the
   ATIS CoD architecture that are relevant to the IETF CDNI work.  It is
   hoped that these use cases can also be used to guide requirements for
   the development of IETF CDNI protocols.

Internet-Draft           CDNI Scenarios for ATIS              March 2011


1.  Introduction

   [ATIS-0800042] specifies a CDN architecture in which the Origin
   Server (ATIS Content Origin Function), CDN Distribution System (ATIS
   Content Distribution and Delivery Functions), and User Agent (ATIS
   ITF) are all within the administrative domain of a Service Provider.
   In this respect, a Service Provider as defined in [ATIS-0800042]
   fulfills both the Content Service Provider and Network Service roles
   as defined in draft-jenkins-cdni-problem-statement-01.

   The ATIS Internet Sourced Content Initative will build on the
   architecture specified in ATIS-0800042 to provides services across
   CDN domain boundaries.  Many of the CDN functions and reference
   points specified in [ATIS-0800042] can be mapped to the achitecture
   specified in draft-jenkins-cdni-problem-statement-01.  Section 2
   below provides the mapping between the CDN architecture specified in
   [ATIS-0800042] and the architecture specified
   draft-jenkins-cdni-problem-statement-01.  Sections 3 and 4 provide
   information about the off net Delivery and Internet Sourced Content
   use cases.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in section 1.1 of
   [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement] and [ATIS-0800042].


2.  ATIS CoD Mapping to CDNI

   The sections below provide a mapping between the ATIS architecture
   and the architecture defined in [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement]

2.1.  Domain Mapping

   The ATIS IIF Internet Sourced Content service is based on the
   architecture specified in [ATIS-0800042] to provide services across
   provider domain boundaries.  The provider domains defined as part of
   the ATIS Internet Sourced Content service include Content Provider,
   Service Provider, and Network Provider.

   The ATIS Content Provider domain is similar to the CDNI Content
   Service Provider.  One difference between the ATIS Content Provider
   and the CDNI Content Service Provider is that the ATIS Content
   Provider may only host the Origin Server for Content associated with
   services hosted by the ATIS Service Provider.

   The ATIS Service Provider hosts services and also manages the access
   network, and provides a Content Service to End Users.  In this

Internet-Draft           CDNI Scenarios for ATIS              March 2011


   respect, the ATIS Service Provider may take on the roles of both the
   CDNI Content Service Provider and the Network Service Provider.  An
   ATIS Service Provider typically manages their access network and uses
   tools such as QoS and policy management to ensure that content
   delivered over their access network is delivered with a guaranteed
   minimum level of quality.

   The ATIS Network provider is the same as the CDNi Network provider.

   The architectural diagrams in sections 3 and 4 illustrate ATIS use
   cases in terms of the roles defined in
   [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement]

2.2.  Architectural Mapping

   Figure 1 below illustrates the architecture and the reference points
   that are relevant to content distribution within [ATIS-08000042].
   Figure 1 also illustrates the mapping of ATIS functions to the CDNI
   functions in [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement].

                      Figure 1: ATIS CDN Architecture

   In Figure 1, the ATIS Content Origin Function is equivalent to an
   Origin Server as defined in RFC 2616.  The ATIS Content Delivery and
   Storage Function (CD&SF) is equivalent to a CDNI Distribution System.
   The ATIS IPTV Terminal Function is equivalent to the CDNI User
   Agent function and the ATIS Location Control Function is equivalent
   to the CDNI Request Routing Function.  The ATIS IPTV Control Function
   manages sessions initiated by IPTV Terminal function.  The session
   interfaces maintained by the IPTV Control Function may be used to
   allocate bandwidth for continuous media delivered over the transport
   network using the services of a Resource and Admission Control (RACF)

   function.

   The ATIS IPTV Control + Location Control Functions are referenced
   from the IPTV Terminal Function via the E3 reference point.  The ATIS
   E3 reference point provides the result of the request routing
   decision to the IPTV Terminal via either an HTTP or RTSP redirect.

   The ATIS E6 reference point implements a stream control and content
   delivery interface. The interface definition of the E6 reference point
   specifies both http and rtsp variants.

   The ATIS C2 reference point interfaces to the ATIS Content Origin
   Function and may also interface to a CDNI upstream CDN.  When the
   ATIS C2 reference point is used to interface to a CDNI upstream CDN,
   it implements the CDNI request and aquisition interfaces.  The ATIS
   C2 reference point defines 2 levels of functionality / compliance.
   They are the Basic Content Origin and the Extended Content Origin.
   The functionality of of these 2 levels of compliance is described
   below.

   The Basic Content Origin Function of the ATIS C2 reference point
   defines metadata that may be considered to be inter-CDN Content
   Distribution Metadata in CDNI.  An example ATIS C2 metadata that may
   be considered as inter-CDN Content Distribution Metadata is
   information about the bandwidth required to stream continuous media
   delivered as HTTP resources in real time.  The ATIS Content
   Distribution & Delivery Function may use this information ensure that
   resources are reserved in order to ensure real time delivery to a
   CDNI downstream CDN or to User Agents using the services of the RACF
   function.  Metadata delivered via the C2 reference point is referred
   to as Media Resource Metadata.  The ATIS C2 reference point is based
   on http.  When an http resource has Media Resource Metadata
   associated with it, the http link header provides a URL where the
   client can obtain the metadata.  The interface definition for the
   ATIS C2 reference point includes an XML schema for Media Resource
   Metadata.

   The Extended Content Origin Function of the ATIS C2 reference point
   defines HTTP extensions such as the Scheduled Transmission Service
   which is used to enable minimum bandwidth guarantees for continuous
   media delivered via HTTP.  The ATIS C2 Scheduled Transmission Service
   enables an ATIS C2 client to request delivery of an HTTP resource at
   a specified minimum rate.  An ATIS C2 server that supports the
   Scheduled Transmission Service may allocate resources associated with
   requests.  An ATIS C2 server that does not have the resources to
   deliver a requested resource at the specified minimum rate will fail
   the requst due to lack of resources.  Section 4.2 describes a use
   case where the use of the ATIS C2 Scheduled Transmission Service may

Internet-Draft           CDNI Scenarios for ATIS              March 2011


   result in additional requirements to the CDNI protocols.


3.  Off Net Delivery

   In the Off Net use case, content hosted by an ATIS Service Provider
   is delivered to subscribers who are roaming.  Content is delivered
   from the ATIS Service Provider's Origin Server and CDN through a CDN
   managed by a Network Service Provider to a user agent.  In this use
   case, the ATIS Service Provider appears as both a CDNI Content
   Service Provider and a Network Service Provider which operates the
   CDNI upstream CDN, while the Network Service Provider operates the
   CDNI downstream CDN.

   Figure 2 below illustrates the ATIS architecture and the ATIS
   reference points that are relevant to the Off Net Delivery use case.
   Figure 2 also illustrates the mapping of ATIS reference points to the
   CDNI interfaces in [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement].

   In Figure 2, the User Agent originally requests content via the E3
   reference point to the ATIS service provider CDN which appears as a
   CDNI upstream CDN.  The E3 reference point implements the CDNI
   request interface.  The ATIS Service provider CDN uses the CDNI
   request routing protocol to determine which downstream CDN to use for
   the requested content.  The E3 reference point is then used to
   provide a URI which references the selected downstream CDN via an
   HTTP or RTSP redirect response.

   This ATIS use case is expected to strictly match the CDNI problem
   statement defined in [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement] and its
   requirements are believed to be already covered in
   [I-D.lefaucheur-cdni-requirements].

4.  Internet Sourced Content

   In the Internet Sourced Content use case, content is delivered from
   an ATIS Content Provider to ATIS Service Provider subscribers over
   the ATIS Service Provider's CDN.  Content may be delivered to the
   ATIS Service Provider's CDN directly from the ATIS Content Provider
   or through a CDN operated by a Network Service Provider that
   interconnects the ATIS Content Provider and the ATIS Service Provider
   CDN.  In both cases, the Content is delivered from the ATIS Service
   Provider's CDN to the User Agent over a managed network.  The
   transport network may include a RACF function.  The RACF function may
   be used to allocate bandwidth for continuous media delivered over the
   transport network.

   Two Internet Source Content use cases which use the CDNI APIs /
   Protocols are described below.

4.1.  Transparent Operation

   Figure 3 below illustrates the architecture and the reference points
   that are relevant to the Internet Sourced Content use case when the
   IETF CDNI APIs / protocols are transparent to the ATIS Service
   Provider's CDN.  Figure 3 also illustrates the mapping of ATIS
   reference points to the CDNI interfaces in
   [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement].

       Figure 3: ATIS Internet Sourced Content Transparent Operation

   In this use case, the ATIS Content Provider appears as both a CDNI
   Content Service Provider and a Network Service Provider which
   operates the CDNI upstream CDN.  The Network Service Provider between
   the ATIS Content provider and ATIS Service Provider operates the CDNI
   downstream CDN.  The ATIS Service Provider operates a CDN which
   appears as a User Agent to the Network Service Provider's Downstream
   CDN.  The operation of the CDNI APIs / protocols is between the
   Content + Network Service Provider's Upstream CDN and the Network
   Service Provider's Downstream CDN.  The ATIS Service Provider's CDN
   is therefore not using CDNI protocols and is not involved in the
   selection of the upstream CDN(s).

   The ATIS Service Provider's CDN receives the initial resource request
   from the ATIS IPTV Terminal via the E6 reference point.  On a cache
   miss, the ATIS Service Provider's CDN reflects the resource request
   to the Content Service Provider's Origin Server via the ATIS C2
   reference point which acts as the CDNI Request Protocol.  The Content
   Service Provider's CDN selects a downstream CDN for the request and
   the selected downstream CDN is provided to the ATIS Service
   Provider's CDN via the C2 reference point in a redirect response.
   When the ATIS Service Provider's CDN receives the redirect response,

Thompson & Kobayashi   Expires September 30, 2011               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           CDNI Scenarios for ATIS              March 2011


   it uses the returned URI to re-issues the ATIS C2 request to the
   selected Network Service Provider.  This second ATIS C2 transaction
   therefore appears as the CDNI Delivery Protocol.

   Since the delivery network between the ATIS Service Provider's CDN
   and the user agent may include a RACF function, the inherent bit rate
   of Continuous Media originating from the Content Service Provider
   should be provided for content delivered to the ATIS Service
   Provider's CDN.  The currently accepted architecture for Internet
   Sourced Content uses the ATIS C2 reference point between the Content
   Service Provider, the Network Service Provider's upstream CDN, and
   the ATIS Service Provider's downstream CDN to deliver this
   information via Media Resource Metadata.  Since Media Resource
   Metadata appears as an HTTP resource, the Network Service Provider's
   CDN may participate transparently in this architecture via regular
   HTTP caching.

   This use case assumes there are enough resources from the Content
   Service Provider's Upstream CDN through the Network Service
   Provider's CDN to the ATIS Service Provider's CDN to enable the
   requested resource to be delivered at or above the rate required to
   deliver it to the ATIS IPTV Terminal in real time.  The use case is
   representative of a scenario where the CDNs upstream of the ATIS
   Service Provider support either HTTP or the Basic Origin
   Functionality of ATIS C2.

   This ATIS use case is expected to match the CDNI problem statement
   defined in [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement] and its requirements
   are believed to be already covered in
   [I-D.lefaucheur-cdni-requirements].

4.2.  ATIS Service Provider Based CDN Selection

   In this use case, the CDN path selected from the ATIS Content
   Provider to the ATIS Service Provider is based on criteria provided
   by the ATIS Service Provider.

   Figure 4below illustrates the architecture and the reference points
   that are relevant to this use case.  Figure 4 also illustrates the
   mapping of ATIS reference points to the CDNI interfaces in
   [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement].

            Figure 4: ATIS Service Provider Based CDN Selection

   As in section 4.1, the ATIS Content Provider appears as both a CDNI
   Content Service Provider and a Network Service Provider which
   operates the CDNI upstream CDN.  The Network Service Provider between
   the ATIS Content provider and ATIS Service Provider operates the CDNI
   downstream CDN.  The ATIS Service Provider operates a CDN which
   appears as a User Agent to the Network Service Provider's Downstream
   CDN.  The operation of the CDNI APIs / protocols is between the
   Content + Network Service Provider's Upstream CDN and the Network
   Service Provider's Downstream CDN.

   The CDNI protocol interactions in this use case are almost identical
   to those described in section 4.1 except that the ATIS Service
   Provider uses the ATIS C2 reference point acting as the CDNI Request
   protocol to influence the CDNI path selection process.  The ATIS C2
   reference point could be used to influence CDNI path selection using
   request attributes associated with ATIS C2 Extended Content Origin
   functionality such as the Scheduled Transmission Service.  If the
   ATIS Service Provider requested the use of the ATIS C2 Scheduled
   Transmission Service via the ATIS C2 reference point, then the CDN
   selection path selected between the ATIS Content Provider and the
   ATIS Service Provider should select a CDN path capable of supporting

   ATIS C2 Scheduled Transmission Service which is a component of ATIS
   C2 Extended Content Origin Functionality.

   In this use case, the ATIS Service Provider CDN may takes a role in
   selecting the upstream CDN(s) on the path to the Content Service
   Provider's Origin Server.  For example, the ATIS Service Provider CDN
   may require that the selected CDN path from the Content Service
   Provider to the ATIS Service Provider only include CDNs that support
   the ATIS C2 Extended Content Origin Functionality.

   This use case matches the CDNI problem statement defined in
   [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement] but introduces a new requirement
   that the CDNI protocol suite must enable the discovery and selection
   of downstream CDNs based on additional attributes such as the ability
   of a CDN to support the ATIS C2 Extended Content Origin
   Functionality.


5.  ATIS Interfaces to CDNI

   Figure 5 illustrates how the ATIS architecture specificed in [ATIS-
   08000042] may interface with the CDNI protocols specified in
   [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement] within the content of the
   Internet Sourced Content and Off Net delivery use cases.

                     Figure 5: ATIS - CDNI Interfaces

   The protocol sequences and interfaces used in the Off Net use case
   are illustrated on the right side of Figure 5 while the protocol
   sequences and interfaces used in the Internet Sourced Content use
   case are illustrated on the left side of Figure 5.

   In the Off Net use case, the IPTV terminal acting as a CDNI User
   Agent inititates the CDNI Request Routing function by issuing an HTTP
   Get or RTSP Setup request via the E3 reference point (step 1).  The
   ATIS Location Control Function uses relevant information from the E3
   reference point (such as the IP address of the IPTV Terminal and the
   request URI) to issue a CDNI Request Routing request to the candidate
   Downstream CDNs (step 2).  Once a Downstream CDN is selected, the
   IPTV Terminal is provided with a reference to the selected Downstream
   CDN via an E3 redirect response (step 3).  Once the redirect response
   is received, the IPTV Terminal re-issues the HTTP Get or RTSP Setup

   request via reference point E6 which in this case acts as a CDNI
   Delivery interface (step 4).  On a cache miss, the Downstream CDN
   forwards the HTTP Get or RTSP Setup request to the Content Delivery
   and Storage Function which responds with the requested content (step
   5).

   In the Internet Sourced Content use case, the Content Delivery and
   Storage Function acting as a CDNI User Agent initiates the CDNI
   Request Routing function by issuing an HTTP Get via the C2 reference
   point (step 1).  The Upstream CDN uses the relevant information from
   the C2 reference point (such as the IP address of the requesting
   CD&SF and the request URI) to issue a CDNI Request Routing request to
   the candidate Downstream CDNs (step 2).  Once a Downstream CDN is
   selected, the CD&SF is provided with a reference to the selected
   Downstream CDN via an C2 redirect response (step 3).  Once the
   redirect response is received, the CD&SF re-issues the HTTP Get
   request via reference point C2 which in this case acts as a CDNI
   Delivery interface (step 4).  On a cache miss, the Downstream CDN
   forwards the HTTP Get request to the Upstream CDN which responds with
   the requested content (step 5).

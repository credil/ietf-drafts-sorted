Abstract

   When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over 
   wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the 
   characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make 
   forwarding decisions. In mobile or other environments where these 
   characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the  
   inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not 
   allow the router to make the best decisions. A bidirectional, event-
   driven communication channel between the router and the modem is 
   necessary.

1. Introduction

   There exist today a collection of modem devices that control links of 
   variable bandwidth and quality. Examples of these types of links 
   include line-of-sight (LOS) radios, satellite terminals, and cable/
   DSL modems. Fluctuations in speed and quality of these links can 
   occur due to configuration (in the case of cable/DSL modems), or on a
   moment-to-moment basis, due to physical phenomena like multipath 
   interference, obstructions, rain fade, etc. It is also quite possible
   that link quality and bandwidth varies with respect to individual 
   neighbors on a link, and with the type of traffic being sent. As an 
   example, consider the case of an 802.11g access point, serving 2 
   associated laptop computers. In this environment, the answer to the 
   question "What is the bandwidth on the 802.11g link?" is "It depends
   on which associated laptop we're talking about, and on what kind of 
   traffic is being sent." While the first laptop, being physically 
   close to the access point, may have a bandwidth of 54Mbps for 
   unicast traffic, the other laptop, being relatively far away, or
   obstructed by some object, can simultaneously have a bandwidth of 
   only 32Mbps for unicast. However, for multicast traffic sent from the
   access point, all traffic is sent at the base transmission rate 
   (which is configurable, but depending on the model of the access 
   point, is usually 24Mbps or less).

   In addition to utilizing variable bandwidth links, mobile networks
   are challenged by the notion that link connectivity will come and go
   over time.  Effectively utilizing a relatively short-lived connection
   is problematic in IP routed networks, as routing protocols tend to
   rely on independent timers at OSI Layer 3 to maintain network 
   convergence (e.g. HELLO messages and/or recognition of DEAD routing
   adjacencies). These short-lived connections can be better utilized 
   with an event-driven paradigm, where acquisition of a new neighbor 
   (or loss of an existing one) is somehow signaled, as opposed to a
   timer-driven paradigm. 

   Another complicating factor for mobile networks are the different 
   methods of physically connecting the modem devices to the router. 
   Modems can be deployed as an interface card in a router's
   chassis, or as a standalone device connected to the router via
   Ethernet, USB, or even a serial link. In the case of Ethernet or 
   serial attachment, with existing protocols and techniques, routing
   software cannot be aware of convergence events occurring on the
   radio link (e.g. acquisition or loss of a potential routing
   neighbor), nor can the router be aware of the actual capacity of
   the link. This lack of awareness, along with the variability in
   bandwidth, leads to a situation where quality of service (QoS)
   profiles are extremely difficult to establish and properly
   maintain. This is especially true of demand-based access schemes

Ratliff et al.           Expires April 6, 2011                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    DLEP                    September 2010

   such as Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) implementations
   used on some satellite systems. With a DAMA-based system,
   additional bandwidth may be available, but will not be used
   unless the network devices emit traffic at rate higher than the
   currently established rate. Increasing the traffic rate does not
   guarantee additional bandwidth will be allocated; rather, it may
   result in data loss and additional retransmissions on the link. 

   In attempting to address the challenges listed above, the authors
   have developed the Data Link Exchange Protocol, or DLEP. The DLEP
   protocol runs between a router and its attached modem devices,
   allowing the modem to communicate link characteristics as they
   change, and convergence events (acquisition and loss of potential
   routing neighbors). The diagram below is used to illustrate the 
   scope of DLEP sessions. When a local client (Modem device) 
   detects the presence of a remote neighbor, it sends an indication
   to its local router via the DLEP session. Upon receipt of the 
   indication, the local router would take appropriate action (e.g. 
   initiation of discovery or HELLO protocols) to converge the 
   network. After notification of the new neighbor, the modem device
   utilizes the DLEP session to report the characteristics of the 
   link (bandwidth, latency, etc) to the router on an as-needed 
   basis. Finally, the Modem is able to use the DLEP session to 
   notify the router when the remote neighbor is lost, shortening
   the time required to re-converge the network.

   DLEP exists as a collection of type-length-value (TLV) based messages
   formatted using RFC 5444. The protocol can be used for both Ethernet-
   attached modems (utilizing, for example, a UDP socket for transport
   of the RFC 5444 packets), or in environments where the modem is an
   interface card in a chassis (via a message passing scheme). DLEP
   utilizes a session paradigm between the modem device and its 
   associated router. If multiple modem devices are attached to a
   router, a separate DLEP session MUST exist for each modem. If a modem
   device supports multiple connections to a router (via multiple
   interfaces), or supports connections to multiple routers, a separate
   DLEP session MUST exist for each connection.

1.1  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2. Assumptions

   In order to implement discovery in the DLEP protocol (thereby 
   avoiding some configuration), we have defined a first-speaker and a
   passive-listener. Specifically, the router is defined as the passive-
   listener, and the modem device defined as the first-speaker (e.g. the
   initiator for discovery). Borrowing from existing terminology, this
   document refers to the first-speaker as the 'client', even though
   there is no client/server relationship in the classic sense.  

   DLEP assumes that participating modem devices appear to the router
   as a transparent bridge - specifically, the assumption is that the
   destination MAC address for data traffic in any frame emitted by
   the router should be the MAC address of the next-hop router or end-
   device, and not the MAC address of any of the intervening modem
   devices. 

   DLEP assumes that security on the session (e.g. authentication of 
   session partners, encryption of traffic, or both) is dealt with by
   the underlying transport mechanism for the RFC 5444 packets (e.g. by
   using a transport such as DTLS [DTLS]). 

   The RFC 5444 message header Sequence Number MUST be included in all 
   DLEP packets. Sequence Numbers start at 1 and are incremented by one
   for each original and retransmitted message.  The unsigned 16-bit
   Sequence Number rolls over at 65535 to 1.  A Sequence Number of 0 is
   not valid. Peer level Sequence Numbers are unique within the context
   of a DLEP session. Sequence numbers are used in DLEP to correlate
   a response to a request.

3. Normal Session Flow

   A session between a router and a client is established by exchanging
   the "Peer Discovery" and "Peer Offer" messages described below.

   Once that exchange has successfully occurred, the client informs the
   router of the presence of a new potential routing partner via the
   "Neighbor Up" message. The loss of a neighbor is communicated via the
   "Neighbor Down" message, and link quality is communicated via the
   "Neighbor Update" message. Note that, due to the issue of metrics
   varying depending on neighbor (discussed above), DLEP link metrics
   are expressed within the context of a neighbor relationship, instead
   of on the link as a whole.

   Once the DLEP session has started, the session partners exchange 
   heartbeat messages based on a negotiated time interval. The heartbeat

Ratliff et al.           Expires April 6, 2011                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    DLEP                    September 2010

   messages are used to assure the session partners are in an 
   appropriate state, and that bidirectional connectivity still exists. 

   In addition to receiving metrics about the link, DLEP provides for
   the ability for the router to request a different amount of 
   bandwidth, or latency, for its client via the Link Characteristics
   Message. This allows the router to deal with requisite increases
   (or decreases) of allocated bandwidth/latency in demand-based
   schemes in a more deterministic manner.

   Length        - 9

   Dead Interval - An 8-bit, unsigned value containing the maximum
                   number of seconds during which no messages can be 
                   received before determining that the session is dead.
                   A value of '0' indicates that the field is ignored.
                   This value is used during the Peer Discovery/Peer 
                   Offer exchange. In other packets, the value MUST be 
                   ignored. 
                   The Dead timer runs at a peer-to-peer level, that is, 
                   it runs between a router and a modem device. If a 
                   peer does NOT receive any messages for a complete 
                   dead interval, it should initiate DLEP session 
                   termination procedures. 

   Router ID     - indicates the router ID of the DLEP session.

   Client ID     - indicates the client ID of the DLEP session.

   When the client initiates discovery (via the Peer Discovery message),
   it MUST set the Client ID to a 32-bit quantity that will be used to 
   uniquely identify this session from the client-side. The client MUST

   set the Router ID to '0'. When responding to the Peer Discovery 
   message, the router MUST echo the Client ID, and MUST supply its own
   unique 32-bit quantity to identify the session from the router's 
   perspective. After the Peer Discovery/Peer Offer exchange, both the
   Client ID and the Router ID MUST be set to the values obtained from 
   the Peer DIscovery/Peer Offer sequence. 


7.2  DLEP Version TLV

   The DLEP Version TLV is OPTIONAL, and is used to indicate the client
   or router version of the protocol. The client and router MAY use this
   information to decide if the peer is running at a supported level. 

   The DLEP Version TLV contains the following fields:

    0                   1                   2                   3

7.3  Peer Type TLV

   The Peer Type TLV is used by the router and client to give additional
   information as to its type. It is an OPTIONAL TLV in both the Peer
   Discovery Message and the Peer Offer message. The peer type is a
   string and is envisioned to be used for informational purposes (e.g.
   display command).

   The Peer Type TLV contains the following fields:

                      are not used and MUST be set to '0'.

   Length           - length of peer type string (80 bytes maximum)
   Peer Type String - Non-Null terminated peer type string, maximum
                      length of 80 bytes. For example, a satellite 
                      modem might set this variable to 'Satellite 
                      terminal'.


7.4  MAC Address TLV

   The MAC address TLV MUST appear in all neighbor-oriented messages 
   (e.g. Neighbor Up, Neighbor Up ACK, Neighbor Down, Neighbor Down 
   ACK, Neighbor Update, Link Characteristics Request, and Link 
   Characteristics ACK). The MAC Address TLV contains the address of
   the far-end (neighbor) router.

   Latency               -  the transmission delay that a packet
                            encounters as it is transmitted over the
                            link. In Neighbor Up, Neighbor Update, 
                            and Link Characteristics ACK, this value
                            is reported in absolute delay, in 
                            milliseconds. The calculation of latency
                            is modem-device dependent. For example, 
                            the latency may be a running average 
                            calculated from the internal queuing. If
                            the modem device cannot calculate latency, 
                            it SHOULD be reported as 0.

                            In the Link Characteristics Request Message,
                            this value represents the maximum delay,
                            in milliseconds, expected on the link. 


7.10  Resources TLV

   The Resources TLV is used in Neighbor Up, Neighbor Update, and Link
   Characteristics ACK messages to indicate a percentage (0-100) amount
   of resources (e.g. battery power) remaining on the modem device.

   The Resources TLV contains the following fields:
   0                   1                   2                   3

                            of remaining resources, such as battery power.
                            If resources cannot be calculated, a value of
                            100 SHOULD be reported. 


7.11  Relative Link Quality TLV

   The Relative Link Quality (RLQ) TLV is used in Neighbor Up, Neighbor 
   Update, and Link Characteristics ACK messages to indicate the
   quality of the link as calculated by the modem device. 

   The Relative Link Quality TLV contains the following fields:

   Relative Link Quality -  a non-dimensional number, 0-100,
                            representing the relative link quality.
                            A value of 100 represents a link of the
                            highest quality. If the RLQ cannot be
                            calculated, a value of 100 should be
                            reported.  


7.12  Status TLV

   The Status TLV is sent from either the client or router to
   indicate the success or failure of a given request 

   The Status TLV contains the following fields:

9. Peer Discovery Messages

   There are two different types of Peer Discovery Messages, Attached
   and Detached.  Attached Peer Discovery Messages are sent by the
   client when it is directly attached to the router (e.g. the client 
   exists as a card in the chassis, or it is connected via Ethernet with
   no intervening devices). The Detached Peer Discovery message, on the 
   other hand, is sent by a "remote" client -- for example, a client at
   a satellite hub system might use a Detached Discovery Message in 
   order to act as a proxy for remote ground terminals. To explain in 
   another way, a detached client uses the variable link itself (the 
   radio or satellite link) to establish a DLEP session with a remote 
   router. 

9.1  Attached Peer Discovery Message

   The Attached Peer Discovery Message is sent by an attached client
   to a router to begin a new DLEP association. The Peer Offer message

   is required to complete the discovery process. The client MAY
   implement its own retry heuristics in the event it (the client)  
   determines the Attached Peer Discovery Message has timed out. 

   The Attached Peer Discovery Message contains the following fields:

   0                   1                   2                   3

11. Peer Update Message 

   The Peer Update message is sent by the router to indicate local 
   Layer 3 address changes. For example, addition of an IPv4 address 
   to the router would prompt a Peer Update message to its attached 
   DLEP clients. If the modem device is capable of understanding and 
   forwarding this information, the address update would prompt any 
   remote DLEP clients (DLEP clients that are on the far-end of the 
   variable link) to issue a "Neighbor Update" message to their local
   routers, with the address change information. Clients that do not
   track Layer 3 addresses MUST silently ignore the Peer Update 
   Message. Clients that track Layer 3 addresses MUST acknowledge the
   Peer Update with a Peer Update ACK message. Routers MAY employ 
   heuristics to retransmit Peer Update messages. Sending of Peer
   Update Messages SHOULD cease when a router implementation
   determines that a partner modem device does NOT support Layer 3 
   address tracking.

   is free to define its heuristics in event of a timeout. The 
   receiver of a Peer Termination Message MUST terminate all  
   neighbor relationships and release associated resources. No
   Neighbor Down messages are sent.

17. Neighbor Down Message

   The client sends the Neighbor Down message to report when a neighbor
   is no longer reachable from the client. The Neighbor Down message 
   MUST contain a MAC Address TLV. Any other TLVs present MAY be
   ignored. A Neighbor Down ACK Message is required to confirm the 
   process. The sender of the Neighbor Down message is free to define
   its retry heuristics in event of a timeout. 

   The Neighbor Down Message contains the following fields:

   0                   1                   2                   3

23. Link Characteristics Request Message

   The Link Characteristics Request Message is sent by the router to 
   the modem device when the router detects that a different set of
   transmission characteristics is necessary (or desired) for the
   type of traffic that is flowing on the link. The request contains
   either a Current Data Rate (CDR) TLV to request a different 
   amount of bandwidth than what is currently allocated, a Latency 
   TLV to request that traffic delay on the link not exceed the 
   specified value, or both. A Link Characteristics ACK Message is
   required to complete the request. Implementations are free to 
   define their retry heuristics in event of a timeout. Issuing a
   Link Characteristics Request with ONLY the MAC Address TLV is a
   mechanism a peer MAY use to request metrics (via the Link

24. Link Characteristics ACK Message

   The Link Characteristics ACK Message is sent by the client to the
   router letting the router know the success (or failure) of the
   requested change in link characteristics.  The Link Characteristics
   ACK message SHOULD contain a complete set of metric TLVs. It MUST
   contain the same TLV types as the request. The values in the
   metric TLVs in the Link Characteristics ACK message MUST reflect
   the link characteristics after the request has been processed.

   The Link Characteristics ACK Message contains the following fields:

25.  Security Considerations

   The protocol does not contain any mechanisms for security (e.g. 
   authentication or encryption). The protocol assumes that any 
   security would be implemented in the underlying transport (for
   example, by use of DTLS or some other mechanism), and is
   therefore outside the scope of this document. 

26.  IANA Considerations

   This section specifies requests to IANA.

26.1  TLV Registrations

   This specification defines:

   o  Twelve TLV types which must be allocated from the 0-223 range
      of the "Assigned Packet TLV Types" repository of [RFC5444].

Internet-Draft                    DLEP                    September 2010

   o  Seventeen Message types which must be allocated from the 0-127
      range of the "Assigning Message TLV Types" repository of 
      [RFC5444].


26.2  Expert Review: Evaluation Guidelines

   For the registries for TLV type extensions where an Expert Review is
   required, the designated expert SHOULD take the same general 
   recommendations into consideration as are specified by [RFC5444].


26.3  Packet TLV Type Registrations

   The Packet TLVs specified below must be allocated from the "Packet
   TLV Types" namespace of [RFC5444].

       o   Identification TLV
       o   DLEP Version TLV
       o   Peer Type TLV
       o   MAC Address TLV
       o   IPv4 Address TLV
       o   IPv6 Address TLV
       o   Maximum Data Rate TLV
       o   Current Data Rate TLV
       o   Latency TLV
       o   Resources TLV
       o   Relative Link Quality TLV
       o   Status TLV

26.4  Message TLV Type Registrations

   The Message TLVs specified below must be allocated from the
   "Message TLV Types" namespace of [RFC5444].

       o   Attached Peer Discovery Message
       o   Detached Peer Discovery Message
       o   Peer Offer Message

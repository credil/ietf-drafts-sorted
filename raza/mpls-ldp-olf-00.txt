Abstract 

   The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) allows one Label Switching 
   Router (LSR) to advertise to another a set of "bindings" between 
   MPLS labels and "Forwarding Equivalence Classes" (FECs).  Suppose 
   LSR2 is advertising a set of label bindings to LSR1.  Frequently, 
   LSR1 does not need to know all of LSR2's label bindings, and LSR1 
   may be configured to disregard bindings in which it has no interest.  
   This document defines an "Outbound Label Filtering" (OLF) mechanism 
   that allows LSR1 to inform LSR2 dynamically of the set of FECs for 
   which it needs to receive label bindings.  LSR2 then applies this 
   filter before sending its label bindings to LSR1. In addition to the 
   generic aspects of this mechanism, this document also specifies 
   outbound label filter for the "Address Prefix FEC" type.

Internet-Draft        LDP Outbound Label Filtering            June 2011 
 

1. Introduction 

  The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) allows one Label Switching 
  Router (LSR) to advertise to another a set of "bindings" between MPLS 
  labels and "Forwarding Equivalence Classes" (FECs).  When LDP's 
  "Downstream Unsolicited" mode [RFC5036] is in use, an LSR may receive 
  label bindings for FECs in which it has no interest. The receiving 
  LSR typically filters out these unwanted label bindings based on its 
  local policy. Since the advertisement of label binding updates by the 
  sender, as well as the processing of these updates by the receiver, 
  consume network bandwidth and LSR resources, it may be beneficial if 
  the advertisement of such label bindings can be avoided at the source 
  itself under the control of the receiver.  
   
  This document defines a label filtering mechanism that allows an LDP 
  speaker to send to its LDP peer a set of FEC-based Outbound Label 
  Filters (OLFs). The peer would apply these filters, in addition to 
  any local outbound filtering policy, to constrain/filter its outbound 
  label binding updates to the speaker. 
   
  This document also defines the Outbound Label Filter (OLF) type 
  "Address Prefix FEC Outbound Label Filter" for "Address Prefix FEC" 
  type, which can be used to perform label filtering for IP Prefix 
  label bindings. 
   
  This specification is modeled on [RFC5291] and [RFC5292]. 
   
2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

   The term "FEC-Type" is used to refer to a tuple consisting of <FEC 
   Element Type, Address Family>. 

3. FEC Label Bindings 

   MPLS LDP associates a FEC with each Label Switched Path (LSP) it 
   creates [RFC5036]. This means that a label is assigned for 1 or more 
   FEC(s) and label bindings advertised to peers are bound to FEC(s). 
   To define an LDP OLF, filters need to be defined for label bindings.

Internet-Draft        LDP Outbound Label Filtering            June 2011 
 

   These filter definitions need to include both FEC Element type, as 
   well as address family, if/as applicable, for a given FEC type. 

   Following is a list of most commonly used LDP FEC elements at the 
   time of writing of this document: 

     FEC Element Type         Address Family      Specification 
     ----------------         -------------       ------------- 
     Wildcard                 N/A                 [RFC5036] 
     Address Prefix           IPv4, IPv6          [RFC5036] 
     Typed Wildcard           AF of Sub-FEC       [RFC5918] 
     P2MP                     IPv4, IPv6          [mLDP] 
     MP2MP-Upstream           IPv4, IPv6          [mLDP] 
     MP2MP-Downstream         IPv4, IPv6          [mLDP] 
     PWid                     N/A                 [RFC4447] 
     Generalized PWid         N/A                 [RFC4447] 
     P2MP PW                  N/A                 [P2MP-PW] 
                                      
                         Table 1: LDP FEC Types   
    

   This document defines a framework for label filtering that applies 
   to all of the FEC types listed under Table 1, except "Wildcard" and 
   "Typed Wildcard" FEC types. The framework is also easily extensible 
   for new FEC types that may get defined in the future.  

4. Outbound Label Filter 

4.1. Constructs 

4.1.1. FEC-Type 

   In the context of this document, we define "FEC-Type" as a construct 
   that uniquely identifies (or maps to) a FEC. This is defined as a 
   tuple of the following form: 

   <FEC Element Type, Address Family> 

   As shown in Table 1, not all FEC elements require qualification with 
   Address Family. For those types, the address family is not specified 
   (set to a reserved value).  

   Following are some example of FEC-Types: 

     <Address Prefix FEC Element, IPv4>

Internet-Draft        LDP Outbound Label Filtering            June 2011 
 

     <Address Prefix FEC Element, IPv6> 

     <PWid, N/A> 

4.1.2. OLF Policy 

  We define an Outbound Label Filtering (OLF) Policy as a set of one or 
  more OLF Elements each corresponding to a given FEC-Type. Where, an 
  OLF Element itself comprises one or more OLF Entries. 

4.1.2.1. OLF Element 

   An OLF Element is identified by a FEC-Type and consists of one or 
   more OLF entries that have a common FEC-Type. The "FEC-Type" 
   component uniquely identifies a FEC and is used to provide a coarse 
   granularity control by limiting an OLF to only those FECs that match 
   the FEC-Type component.  

  To define an OLF Element for a given FEC-Type, precise conditions and 
  rules need to be specified under which the given FEC is considered to 
  match a particular OLF entry.  

4.1.2.2. OLF Entry 

   An OLF entry is a tuple of the form: 

      <Action, OLF-value> 

   The "Action" component specifies how the OLF filter is to be handled 
   by the receiving LSR. The specified values for Action include 
   "PERMIT", "DENY", and "PERMIT-ALL". PERMIT action indicates to 
   receiving LSR to allow advertisement of label bindings for the set 
   of FECs that match the OLF entry, DENY is opposite of PERMIT and 
   disallows (i.e. filters) the advertisement of label bindings for the 
   set of FECs that match the OLF entry. PERMIT-ALL is the wildcard 
   equivalent of PERMIT, and hence apply to all FECs associated with 
   the FEC-Type of the OLF Element corresponding to OLF entry. 

   The "OLF-value" component is FEC-specific and provides the 
   specification of FEC for matching. This component is not mandatory 
   and is not present when Action component is PERMIT-ALL. The format 
   of OLF-value for a FEC element type is to be defined by the designer 
   of the given FEC element. This document defines the format of OLF-
   Value for FEC-Types corresponding to "Address Prefix" FEC Element 
   type [RFC5036].

4.2. OLF Signaling 

4.2.1. OLF Policy Status TLV 

   An OLF is signaled to a peer through LDP Notification messages. A 
   new status TLV, named "OLF Policy Status", is introduced to carry 
   the OLF specifications. This TLV is carried in the optional 
   parameter section of the LDP Notification message. Moreover, a new 
   LDP Status Code, "OLF Status", is defined for use in LDP Status TLV 
   to indicate the presence of "OLF Policy Status" TLV in a given 
   Notification message.  

   A single OLF Policy Status TLV may contain one or more OLF Element 
   sub-TLVs. Each OLF Element TLV represents a single FEC-Type and 
   consists of one or more "OLF Entry" sub-TLVs.

   Where: 

     U/F bits:  U-bit/F-bit MUST be set to 1/0 respectively so that a 
       receiver MUST silently ignore this TLV if unknown to it, and 
       continue processing the rest of the message. 

     Length: Total length (in octets) of "OLF Policy Status TLV" 
       following the "Length" field. There is no padding requirement at 
       the end of this TLV in case TLV does not end at Word boundary. 

     OLF Element(s): One or more OLF Element sub-TLVs. In a given OLF 
       Policy Status TLV, only one OLF Element for a given FEC-Type is 
       allowed. If more than one OLF Element is present for a given 
       FEC-Type, then receiving LSR MUST pick the first occurrence of

       such an element and ignore the other occurrences corresponding 
       to the given FEC-Type. 

     M-bit: "More" bit specifying if there are more/further OLF Policy 
       Status to follow for the given update set. The bit is set to 1 
       if there are further portion of policy that will follow in 
       subsequent message(s), and set to 0 if the TLV alone constitutes 
       the policy, or is the last update for the given update set.  

     Reserved bits: Reserved for future use. MUST be set to zero on 
       transmit and MUST be ignored on receipt. 

   An LSR MAY also update its OLF with a peer by sending subsequent 
   "OLF Policy Status" TLVs in LDP Notification messages. The receipt 
   of an OLF Policy update from a peer for a given FEC-Type is meant to 
   replace (overwrite) the previously installed FEC-Type OLF policy 
   corresponding to the peer, if any, at the receiving LSR.  

   A complete OLF policy can be splitted across more than one OLF 
   policy updates -- e.g. if the given OLF policy is big enough to fit 
   in a single Notification message (due to LDP PDU size limitation 
   [RFC5036]). In such cases, the sender LSR sends more than one LDP 
   Notification message(s) with "OLF Policy Status" TLV, splitting the 
   policy on OLF Element boundaries (i.e. an OLF Element MUST NOT span 
   across more than one message). The sender also indicates if more 
   than single Policy message will be sent for the given OLF update, as 
   well as indicates the last message in the given update set. The 
   receiver LSR, upon receiving OLF updates that span across more than 
   one message, stores them in the order of receipt and processes them 
   only after complete policy set has been received. If an LSR receives 
   an incomplete/partial update set, and does not receive end of update 
   (i.e. last message in the given set with M bit set to 0), it keeps 
   these partial updates in its temporary buffer until one of the 
   following events occur: 

   1. End of [policy] update received (OLF Policy Status TLV with M=0) 
   2. Session terminates 
   3. OLF capability changes 

4.2.2. OLF Element Format 

   As shown in Figure 2, an OLF Element comprises one or more OLF 
   entries grouped by FEC-Type <FEC Element Type, Address Family>:

     Length: Length (in octets) of the OLF Element sub-TLV following 
       the "Length" field; i.e. total length of OLF entries that follow 
       in the given OLF Element sub-TLV. There is no padding 
       requirement at the end of this TLV in case TLV does not end at 
       Word boundary.

     Common part: Common definition that is applicable to all types of 
       OLF entries. 
     Type-specific part: Type specific (variable) definition 
       corresponding to FEC-Type; also called "OLF-value" under section 
       4.1.2.2.  

   The "Common part" is one-octet field defined as following: 

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |Action | Rsvd  | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Where:  

     Action: Indicates the desired action (operation) to be performed 
       by receiving LSR on received OLF entry, if FEC matches. The 
       possible values are 

           0: PERMIT 
           1: DENY 
           2: PERMIT-ALL 
       4-15: Reserved (for future use). 
      
     Rsvd: Reserved for future use. MUST be set to 0 on transmit and 
       MUST be ignored on the receipt. 
      
4.2.4. Rules for OLF Element and OLF Entry 

   Following rules apply to OLF Element and Entries: 

   o  When the Action component of an OLF entry specifies a wildcard 
      operation (PERMIT-ALL), then the OLF entry MUST consist of only 
      the Common part. 

   o  When an OLF Element contains more than one OLF entry, then 
      receiving LSR MUST process the OLF entries in the same order as 
      they are specified inside the OLF element.  

   o  When processing a received OLF Element, an LSR MUST assume an 
      implicit "DENY-ALL" as the last rule/entry. This assumption means 
      that LSR denies all those FECs [of given FEC-Type] that have not 
      already been matched in any of the specified OLF entries. This 
      also means that the sender LSR needs to construct an OLF Element 
      while keeping in mind an implicit DENY-ALL as the last rule.

4.3. OLF Capability negotiation 

   When a session has been negotiated to operate in Downstream 
   Unsolicited mode, LDP speakers exchange all of their label bindings. 
   If it is desired/required to exchange only selected label bindings 
   between peers, the "Outbound Label Filtering Capability" is 
   negotiated at session establishment time or at a later time.  

   An LDP speaker advertises the OLF Capability to announce to its peer 
   its capability [and desire] to either send or receive or both 
   send/receive OLF filters. The OLF feature will, however, work only 
   when at least one LSR is able to send and other able to receive the 
   OLF filters. The OLF Capability can be sent either in an 
   Initialization message (Capability TLV's S-bit MUST be set to 1) or 
   in a Capability message (Capability TLV's S-bit set to 1 or 0 to 
   advertise or withdraw this capability respectively).  

   "Outbound Label Filtering" (OLF) capability is a new LDP capability, 
   defined in accordance with LDP Capability definition guidelines 
   [RFC5561]. The format of "Outbound Label Filtering" capability is as 
   follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

     OLF Capability Element(s): This is the Capability-specific data 
       [RFC5561] that is defined for OLF Capability, and consists of 
       one or more "OLF Capability Element" types (defined below).  
      
  An LDP speaker that advertises OLF capability MUST support "OLF 
  Policy Status" and "OLF Status" Status Code.  
 
   The format of an "OLF Capability Element" sub-TLV is specified as

    T-bit: Transmit/Send capability; set to 1 when the LDP speaker is 
       able/willing to send OLF filters to its peer, set to zero 
       otherwise.

  with both T/R bits set to zero, then the receiving LSR SHOULD ignore 
  the corresponding OLF Capability Element and continue processing the 
  rest of the TLV. The semantics and usage of T/R-bits is elaborated 
  more in following sections. 
 
  There MUST be one and only one OLF Capability Element specified for a 
  given FEC-Type in an OLF Capability TLV. Upon receiving more than one 
  OLF Capability Element for a given FEC-Type in the same "OLF 
  Capability TLV", the receiving LSR MUST send an LDP Notification 
  message towards the sender with "Malformed TLV" status code, and 
  abort the processing of entire message.  
   
4.4. OLF Procedures 

   To describe the OLF procedures in the following subsections, let us 
   consider LDP speaker LSR1 that is capable of sending OLF policy 
   filters (for one or more FEC types), and LSR2 that is capable of 
   receiving (and processing) them. Let us assume that the supported 
   FEC-Types for OLF are IPv4/IPv6 "Address Prefix FEC" OLF types. 
   Henceforth, both LSRs are configured respectively to send/receive 
   OLF filters for "IPv4/IPv6 Address Prefix" OLF types to/from its 
   peer. Let us also assume that the LSR1 is configured with an OLF 
   filtering policy for "IPv4/IPv6 Address Prefix" FEC-Types that needs 
   to be pushed to LSR2. 

   Moreover, assume that both LSR1 and LSR2 support "Dynamic Capability 
   Announcement" capability TLV [RFC5561] and hence are capable of 
   handling dynamic capability changes. 

4.4.1. OLF Capability Negotiation At Session Establishment Time 

   At the session initialization time, LSR1 constructs an "OLF 
   Capability TLV" with S-bit set to 1. The TLV also contains two OLF 
   Capability Elements corresponding to FEC-Types "IPv4 Address Prefix" 
   (FEC Elem Type=0x2, Address Family=0x1) and "IPv6 Address Prefix" 
   (FEC Elem Type=0x2, Address Family=0x2). The LSR also sets T-bit/R-
   bit of these OLF Capability Elements to 1/0 respectively.  

   LSR1 then includes this "OLF Capability TLV" in the LDP 
   Initialization message to LSR2.  

   LSR2, on the other hand, constructs/sends the "OLF Capability TLV" 
   in the same manner as done by LSR1; the only difference being that 
   LSR2 sets T-bit/R-bit of its OLF Capability Elements to 0/1 
   respectively. 
 
 
Raza                    Expires December 2011                 [Page 12] 
    
Internet-Draft        LDP Outbound Label Filtering            June 2011 
 

   Having exchanged/negotiated the "OLF Capability TLVs" successfully, 
   LSR2 treats this as an implicit DENY for all label bindings for 
   given FEC-Types (IPv4/IPv6 Prefix) and blocks any label binding 
   advertisements towards LSR1 corresponding to these FEC-Types. LSR2 
   now waits for subsequent OLF filters/policy (via LDP Notification 
   messages) from LSR1. LSR1 also understands that LSR2 is capable of 
   receiving the OLF filters and hence it constructs OLF filters using 
   its configured OLF policy for LSR2, and sends these filters to LSR2 
   via "OLF Policy Status TLV" in an LDP Notification message (Status 
   code set to OLF Status). Upon the receipt of such an OLF policy, 
   LSR2 reacts and applies the received outbound policy in addition to 
   any locally configured outbound policy, and advertises towards LSR1 
   the label bindings corresponding to the matching "permitted" 
   prefixes.  

   Since LSR2 is operating only in Receive mode for given OLF 
   with LSR1, LSR1 does not block the advertisements and advertises all 
   its label bindings for given IP Prefix FECs (in accordance with its 
   locally configured outbound policy) towards LSR2.  

4.4.1.1. Peer Incapable of "Receive" OLF  

   Consider a case where LSR2 is not OLF "Receive" capable for given 
   FEC-Types. This means that LSR2 either does not send any "OLF 
   Capability" corresponding to given FEC-Type, or "OLF Capability" for 
   given FEC-Type does not have R-bit set. Having negotiated the "OLF 
   Capability" for given FEC-Types, LSR1 realizes that LSR2 is not 
   capable of receiving OLF filters for given FEC-Type(s), and hence 
   LSR1 does not send any OLF filters (via LDP Notification message). 
   In this case, LSR2 sends label bindings corresponding to given FEC-
   Type(s) towards LSR1 in unsolicited manner after session 
   establishment, at which point, LSR1 may chose to discard them by 
   applying the filtering policy in inbound direction. 

4.4.2. OLF Capability Dynamic Changes 

   It is possible that OLF capability is enabled on an LSR after 
   session has already been established with the peer. To signal and 
   negotiate OLF Capability dynamically, both peers MUST support 
   "Dynamic Capability Announcement" TLV [RFC5561].  

4.4.2.1. "Send" OLF capability changes 

   Let's consider a case when LSR2 is initially configured to be able 
   to receive OLF filters for IPv4/IPv6 Prefix FEC-Types, but LSR1 is 
   not configured to be able to "send" the same. Now, a user enables 
   and configures LSR1 to send OLF filters for given FECs towards LSR2.

Internet-Draft        LDP Outbound Label Filtering            June 2011 
 

   This triggers LSR1 to construct an "OLF Capability" TLV in the same 
   manner as described in section 4.4.1. The constructed "OLF 
   Capability" is sent in a Capability message (with S-bit set to 1) 
   towards LSR2. Upon receipt of this Capability message, LSR2 
   withdraws all label bindings from LSR1 corresponding to given FEC-
   Type(s). Later on, LSR1 sends its OLF filters via "OLF Policy 
   Status" and duly applied by LSR2.  

   Assuming both LSR1 and LSR2 are already engaged in OLF filtering in 
   sender and receiver roles respectively for given FEC-Types. Now 
   consider that LSR1 configuration is changed to remove "send" 
   capability for one FEC type (say IPv4 Prefix) towards LSR2. This 
   triggers LSR1 to construct an "OLF Capability" TLV that includes 
   only one OLF Capability Element corresponding to "IPv4 Prefix" FEC 
   type. The constructed "OLF Capability" is sent in a Capability 
   message (with S-bit set to 0) towards LSR2. Upon receipt of this 
   Capability [withdrawal] message, LSR2 removes any existing OLF 
   filter towards LSR1 corresponding to given FEC-Type "IPv4 Prefix", 
   and re-advertises to LSR1 its entire label bindings database for 
   given FEC-Type.  

4.4.2.2. "Receive" OLF capability changes 

   Let's consider a case when LSR1 is initially configured to be able 
   to send OLF filters for IPv4/IPv6 Prefix FEC-Types, but LSR2 is not 
   configured to be able to "receive" the same. Now, a user enables and 
   configures LSR2 to be able to receive OLF filters for IPv4/IPv6 
   Prefix FECs from LSR1. This triggers LSR2 to construct an "OLF 
   Capability" TLV in the same manner as described in section 4.4.1. 
   The constructed "OLF Capability" is sent in a Capability message 
   (with S-bit set to 1) towards LSR1. Upon receipt of this Capability 
   message, LSR1 realizes that LSR2 is now capable to receive OLF 
   filters for IPv4/IPv6 Prefix FEC types. As described in earlier 
   section, LSR1 now proceeds by constructing "OLF Policy Status" using 
   its configured filters for LSR2, and sends them in an LDP 
   Notification message towards LSR2. Upon receipt of this message, 
   LSR2 applies the received OLF policy and withdraws any label 
   bindings corresponding to matching FEC (prefixes) that are no more 
   permitted for advertisement. Later on, LSR1 can also update its OLF 
   filters by pushing updates to LSR2 as/when any change in LSR1's OLF 
   policy occurs. 

   Assuming both LSR1 and LSR2 are already engaged in OLF filtering in 
   sender and receiver roles respectively for given FEC-Types. Now 
   consider that LSR2 configuration is changed to remove "receive" 
   capability for one FEC-Type (say IPv4 Prefix) from LSR1. This 
   triggers LSR2 to construct an "OLF Capability" TLV that includes

   only one OLF Capability Element corresponding to "IPv4 Prefix" FEC 
   type. The constructed "OLF Capability" is sent in a Capability 
   message (with S-bit set to 0) towards LSR1. Upon receipt of this 
   Capability [withdrawal] message, LSR1 marks LSR2 as IPv4 Prefix FEC 
   OLF "receive" incapable peer, and makes sure that no more OLF filter 
   updates (via LDP Notification messages) are sent to LSR2. LSR2, 
   after sending the Capability [withdrawal] message, now deletes any 
   installed OLF filter corresponding to LSR1 for "IPv4 Prefix" FEC, 
   and re advertises its entire label bindings database for "IPv4 
   Prefix" FEC to LSR1. Upon receipt of unwanted label bindings, LSR1 
   may chose to discard them by applying the filtering policy in 
   inbound direction. 

4.4.3. OLF Policy Updates 

   After successful negotiation of "OLF Capability" for a FEC-Type with 
   the peer as the receiver and self as the sender, an LSR SHOULD now 
   send its OLF policy to its peer via "OLF Policy Status" TLV in an 
   LDP Notification message. The LSR MAY also update its OLF policy 
   towards its peer by sending further updates, if/when its locally 
   configuration/policy changes. 

   Consider LSR1 as sender and LSR2 as receiver of OLF filters for 
   IPv4/IPv6 Prefix FEC types. After successful negotiation of OLF 
   capabilities, LSR1 proceeds by sending its OLF filters towards LSR2 
   via LDP Notification message. LSR1 first constructs Status TLV and 
   sets its status code to "OLF Status", and adds the "OLF Policy 
   Status" TLV in the optional parameter section of the Notification 
   message. The contents of "OLF Policy Status" TLV are constructed as 
   set of OLF filters as defined by local configuration and policy for 
   one or more OLF types. The sender MUST only include those OLF types 
   in this TLV for which it has successfully negotiated the OLF 
   capability with the peer. In our example, LSR1 constructs two OLF 
   Elements for IPv4 and IPv6 Prefix FEC types. Each OLF Element is 
   constructed with one ore more OLF Entries, as defined by or mapped 
   to locally configured OLF policy corresponding to LSR2. LSR1 then 
   sends the constructed "OLF Policy Status" TLV, alongwith Status TLV 
   (with status set to "OLF Status") in a LDP Notification message to 
   LSR2.   

   The receiver LDP speaker LSR2 MUST honor the receipt of this TLV in 
   a Notification message because it had successfully negotiated the 
   capability as the receiver for one or more OLF types. If an LDP 
   speaker receives a "OLF Policy Status" TLV in a Notification message 
   without prior OLF Capability(ies) exchange and negotiation, or if 
   negotiated OLF Capability as sender-only role, it MUST ignore the 
   received "OLF Policy Status" TLV, send a "Unknown TLV" Notification

Internet-Draft        LDP Outbound Label Filtering            June 2011 
 

   back to the peer, and continue processing rest of the message. 
   Similarly, LSR2 behaves the same way on receipt of this TLV in a 
   Notification message with status code other than "OLF Status", and 
   respond back with "Malformed TLV" Notification.  

   If the receiver LSR2 does not understand or does not support the 
   FEC-Type (FEC Element type and/or Address Family) specified in an 
   "OLF Element", it MUST respond with a LDP Notification with status 
   code set to "Unknown FEC" or "Unsupported Address Family" as 
   applicable, and abort processing of the entire message. 

   If LSR1's configured OLF policy changes, LSR1 sends further updates 
   using "OLF Policy Status" in a LDP Notification message. Upon 
   receipt of such an update for given FEC-Type, LSR2 treats this as an 
   overwrite of the previously installed OLF filters corresponding to 
   LSR1, and re-applies the policy. As the result of policy re-
   application, LSR2 advertises any new [matching] prefix being 
   permitted now, and withdraws any previously advertised prefixes 
   which are no longer permitted as per matching rules. 

5. Address Prefix FEC OLF Type 

   Using the earlier OLF framework defined in this document, this 
   section defines the OLF type for the "Address Prefix" FEC Element 
   type. The OLF types for other FEC Element types are beyond the scope 
   of this document. 

   The "Address Prefix FEC" OLF type allows one to express OLFs in 
   terms of address prefixes. That is, it provides filtering based on 
   address prefixes, including prefix length or range based matching. 

   To define an OLF for "Address Prefix FEC" type of given address 
   family, the FEC-Elem-Type and Address-Family fields of an OLF 
   Element are defined as follows: 

   FEC-Elem-Type: 0x2 ("Address Prefix") 
   Address-Family: 1 (IPv4) or 2 (IPv6) 
    
   Conceptually, an "Address Prefix FEC" OLF entry for a given Address 
   Family consists of the fields <Action, Prefix Length, Prefix, 
   Minlen, Maxlen>, and hence the "Address Prefix FEC" OLF entry within 
   an "Address Prefix FEC" OLF element is encoded as follows:

                  Figure 7: Address Prefix FEC OLF Entry 
    
   With reference to Fig 3, the first octet of the above OLF Entry 
   belongs to the "Common part" and the rest of the fields belong to 
   the "Type-specific part" (as defined for Address Prefix FEC Element 
   type). 
    
   As per OLF Entry rules defined earlier, if the Action component of 
   the entry specifies wildcard operation ("PERMIT-ALL"), then Address 
   Prefix FEC OLF Entry does not specify any type-specific data (i.e. 
   OLF entry size is 1 octet only).  

   The "Minlen" and "Maxlen" fields indicate respectively the minimum 
   and the maximum prefix length in bits that is used for "matching". 
   Either the Minlen or Maxlen field or both may have the value 0; this 
   means that the value of the field is "unspecified". The Maxlen 
   value must not be more than the maximum length (in bits) of a host 
   address for the given address family. 

   The "Prefix Len" field indicates the length in bits of the address 
   prefix. This field MUST NOT be specified as zero.  

   The "Prefix" field contains an address prefix encoded according to 
   the given address family. 

   This document imposes that values of these fields MUST satisfy the 
   following rule, assuming Minlen and Maxlen are specified: 

   0 < Prefix Len <= Minlen <= Maxlen 

5.1. Matching Address Prefixes to OLF Entries 

   Consider an Address Prefix FEC OLF entry, and an IP route maintained 
   by an LDP speaker in the form of <Prefix, Prefix Length>. Following 
   are the matching rules defined for Address Prefix OLF specific 
   matching.

o  The IP route is considered as "no match" to the OLF entry if the 
   route prefix is neither more specific than, nor equal to, the 
   <Prefix, Prefix Len> fields of the OLF entry.  
    
o  When the IP route is either more specific than, or equal to, the 
   <Prefix, Prefix Len> fields of the OLF entry, the route is 
   considered as a match to the OLF entry only if the match conditions 
   as listed in Table 2 are satisfied (where un-spec refers to a value 
   of zero). 
    

        OLF Entry                Route Prefix 
    Minlen      Maxlen           Match Condition 
   +------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
   | un-spec.  |  un-spec.  |      Route.Prefix Len == OLF.Prefix Len |        
   | specified |  un-spec.  |      Route.Prefix Len >= OLF.Minlen     | 
   | un-spec.  |  specified |      Route.Prefix Len <= OLF.Maxlen     | 
   | specified |  specified |      Route.Prefix Len >= OLF.Minlen     | 
   |           |            |  AND Route.Prefix Len <= OLF.Maxlen     | 
   +------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
             Table 2: Address Prefix OLF Entry Matching Rules 

o  When more than one Address Prefix OLF entry matches the route, the 
   "first-match" rule applies. That is, the OLF entry that is specified 
   (and processed) first in a given OLF update (among all the matching 
   OLF entries) is considered as the sole match, and it would determine 
   whether the route should be permitted or denied. 
 

6. Operational Examples 

6.1. Label Filtering at Area Border Router 

   A typical service provider core network is designed with two or more 
   levels of IGP hierarchy. In OSPF parlance, a backbone area is 
   connected to multiple islands of non-zero areas. Similarly, in an 
   IS-IS network, core L2 areas are connected to L1 areas. When LDP is 
   enabled in such a network, an ABR (or a L2 router) that connects 
   multiple non-zero areas to the backbone will advertise LDP label 
   bindings for all prefixes (non-zero area as well as backbone area). 
   However, depending on the MPLS hierarchy, each ABR may want label 
   bindings for only the backbone area prefixes. The OLF scheme 
   specified in this document provides a mechanism to do so 
   efficiently.

6.2. LSR with limited LIB size 

   Assume an LSR (LSR1) is not capable of storing all IPv4 label 
   bindings from its peer (LSR2) in its IPv4 Label Information Base 
   (LIB), and it is desirable to receive and store only handful of 
   remote label bindings from its peer. One approach of solving this 
   issue is to use Downstream on Demand mode of label distribution so 
   that LSR2 does not send its entire label database unsolicitedly 
   towards LSR1. Instead, LSR1 uses Label Request mechanics to request 
   labels for [handful of] interested FECs from its peer LSR2. This 
   approach has few drawbacks: 

   a. This forces Downstream On Demand label distribution mode on both 
     LSRs (LSR1 and LSR2) engaged in the session, although this mode is 
     really required by LSR1 due to its limitation. 

   b. The control plane signaling convergence for Downstream On Demand 
     label distribution mode is slower than Downstream Unsolicited.  

   An alternate approach to meet LSR1 requirement is to use OLF 
   mechanics while using Downstream Unsolicited distribution mode. In 
   this approach, LSR1 and LSR2 will negotiate OLF Capability as 
   sender/receiver respectively, and LSR1 will install OLF filters to 
   limit the IPv4 label bindings sent by LSR2 to the only IPv4 prefixes 
   in which LSR1 is interested in. 

7. Security Considerations 

  The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new 
  security considerations beyond that already apply to the base LDP 
  specification [RFC5036] and [RFC5920]. 
   
8. IANA Considerations 

  The document introduces following new protocol elements that require 
  code point assignment by IANA: 
   
   o  "Outbound Label Filter Capability" TLV (requested code point: 
      0x50E) 

   o  "Outbound Label Filter Policy Status" TLV (requested code point: 
      0x50F) 

   o  "Outbound Label Filter Status" status code (requested code point: 
      0x00000050)

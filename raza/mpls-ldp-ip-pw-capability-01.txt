Abstract 

   Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like 
   IP label switching and L2VPN/PW signaling. When an LDP session comes 
   up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state for 
   such LDP applications even when the peer session may be established 
   for some other applications like ICCP. This document proposes a 
   solution by which an LDP speaker announces its "incapability" or 
   disability or non-support for IP label switching or L2VPN/PW 
   application, hence disabling corresponding application state exchange 
   over the established LDP session.

Internet-Draft          LDP IP and PW Capability              April 2011 
 

1. Introduction 

  LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] introduced a mechanism to negotiate LDP 
  capabilities for a given feature amongst peer LSRs. This mechanism 
  insures that no unnecessary state is exchanged between peer LSRs 
  unless corresponding feature capability is successfully negotiated 
  between peers.  
   
  While new features and applications, such as Typed Wildcard FEC 
  [RFC5918], Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol [ICCP], mLDP 
  [MLDP], make use of LDP capabilities framework for their feature 
  negotiation, the earlier LDP features and applications like IP label 
  switching and L2VPN/PW signaling [RFC4447] may cause unnecessary 
  state exchange between LDP peers even when the given application is 
  not enabled on one of the LDP speakers participating in a given 
  session. For example, when bringing up and using an LDP peer session 
  with a remote PE LSR for purely ICCP signaling purposes, the LDP 
  speaker may unnecessarily advertise labels for IP (unicast) prefixes 
  to this ICCP related LDP peer as per its default behavior. To avoid 
  this unnecessary state advertisement and exchange, currently customers 
  are typically required to configure/define some sort of LDP state
  (label) filtering policies on the box, which introduces operational
  overhead and complexity.  
   
  This document proposes a solution by which an LDP speaker may announce 
  its "incapability" (or disability) to its peer for IP Label Switching 
  and/or L2VPN/PW Signaling application at session establishment time. 
  This helps avoiding unnecessary state exchange for such feature 
  applications. The proposal also state the mechanics to enable 
  previously disabled application later during the session lifetime. 
  The document introduces two new LDP Capabilities for IP label 
  switching and L2VPN/PW applications to implement this proposal.

3. Non-negotiated LDP applications 

   For the applications that existed before LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] 
   mechanics were defined, LDP speaker may advertise relevant 
   application state to its peers after session establishment without 
   waiting for any capabilities exchange and negotiation.  

   Currently, the most important non-negotiated applications include: 

   o  IP [v4 and v6] label switching 

   o  L2VPN/PW signaling 

   To disable unnecessary state exchange for such LDP applications, two 
   new capabilities are being introduced in this document. These new 
   capabilities allow an LDP speaker to notify its LDP peer at the 
   session establishment time when one or more LDP "Non-negotiated 
   applications" are not required/configured on the sender side. Upon 
   receipt of such capability, if supported, the receiving LDP speaker 
   MUST disable the advertisement of application state towards the 
   sender. These capabilities can also be sent later in a Capability 
   message to either disable these applications, or to enable 
   previously disabled applications. 

3.1. Application Control Capabilities 

   To control advertisement of state related to non-negotiated LDP 
   applications, namely IP Label switching and L2VPN/PW signaling, two 
   new capability TLVs are defined as described in the following 
   subsections. 

3.1.1. IP Label Switching Capability TLV 

   The IP Label Switching capability is a new Capability Parameter 
   defined with the following format: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1   
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |1|0| IP Label Sw. Cap (IANA)   |           Length (2)          | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |1| Reserved    | AF Bitmap     | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   The value of the U-bit for the IP capability parameter TLV MUST be 
   set to 1 so that a receiver MUST silently ignore this TLV if unknown

Internet-Draft          LDP IP and PW Capability              April 2011 
 

   to it, and continue processing the rest of the message. Once 
   advertised, this capability cannot be withdrawn and hence the S-bit 
   must always be set to 1 both in Initialization message and Capability 
   message. The capability data associated with this TLV is 1 octet long 
   "Address Family Bitmap", and hence the TLV length MUST be set to 2.  
    
   The Capability data "Address Family Bitmap" is defined as: 
    
 
    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |   AF bitmap   | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Where:   

       bit0: IPv4 label switching application 

       bit1: IPv6 label switching application       

       bit2-7: Reserved.    

   A bit in the bitmap is set to 0 or 1 to disable or enable 
   respectively a corresponding IP application. 

   As described earlier, "IP Label Switching" Capability Parameter TLV 
   MAY be included by an LDP speaker in an Initialization message to 
   signal to its peer LSR that state exchange for IPv4 and/or IPv6 
   application(s) need to be disabled on a given peer session. This TLV 
   can also be sent later in a Capability message to selectively enable 
   or disable IPv4/v6 label switching application(s). 

3.1.2. PW Signaling Capability TLV  

   The "PW Signaling" capability is a new Capability Parameter defined 
   with the following format:  

    0                   1                   2                   3 

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1   
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |1|0|  PW Sig. Cap (IANA)       |           Length (2)          | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |1| Reserved    |E| Reserved    |      
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft          LDP IP and PW Capability              April 2011 
 

   The value of the U-bit for the PW capability parameter TLV MUST be 
   set to 1 so that a receiver MUST silently ignore this TLV if unknown 
   to it, and continue processing the rest of the message. Once 
   advertised, this capability cannot be withdrawn and hence the S-bit 
   MUST always be set to 1 in Initialization message or Capability 
   message. The capability data associated with this TLV is 1 octet long 
   and hence the TLV length MUST be set to 2.  
    
   The capability data is defined as following byte:  

   7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |E|   Reserved  | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   Where E-bit (Enable bit) is used to control PW signaling application 
   by setting it to 0 and 1 to disable and enable the application 
   respectively.  

   As described earlier, PW Signaling Capability Parameter TLV MAY be 
   included by an LDP speaker in an Initialization message to signal to 
   its peer LSR that state exchange for PW application need to be 
   disabled on given peer session. This TLV can also be sent later in a 
   Capability message to enable/disable the PW Signaling application. 

3.2. Procedures for Application Control Capabilities in an 
     Initialization message 

   LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] dictate that the S-bit of capability 
   parameter in an Initialization message MUST be set to 1 and SHOULD be 
   ignored on receipt.   

   An LDP speaker determines (e.g. via some local configuration or 
   default policy) if they need to disable IP and/or L2VPN/PW 
   applications with a peer LSR. If there is a need to disable, then the 
   IP and/or PW application capability TLVs need to be included in the 
   Initialization message with respective application bits set to 0 to 
   indicate application disable, where the application bit refers to a 
   bit in "Address Family Bitmap" of the "IP Label Switching" Capability 
   or E-bit in "PW Signaling" Capability.   

   An LDP speaker that supports the "IP Label Switching" and/or "PW 
   Signaling" capability MUST interpret those TLVs in a received 
   Initialization message such that it disables the advertisement of the

Internet-Draft          LDP IP and PW Capability              April 2011 
 

   application state towards the sender LSR for IP (v4 and/or v6) and/or 
   L2VPN/PW applications if their application control bits are set to 0. 
   If a receiving LDP speaker does not understand the capability TLVs, 
   then it MUST respond to the sender with "Unsupported TLV" 
   Notification as described in LDP Capabilities [RFC5561]. Upon receipt 
   of such Notification, the sender MAY still continue to block/disable 
   its outbound state advertisement towards the peer for the requested 
   disabled applications. 

   Once this capability has been sent by sender LSR and received and 
   understood by the receiver LSR, then both these LSRs MUST NOT 
   exchange any state related to the disabled applications until and 
   unless these applications are explicitly enabled again (e.g. via the 
   same Capability TLV sent in a Capability message with corresponding 
   application control bit set to 1). 

   "IP Label Switching" and "PW Signaling" capability TLVs are 
   unilateral/uni-directional in nature. This means that the receiving 
   LSR may not need to send a similar capability TLV in an 
   Initialization or Capability message towards the sender. This 
   unilateral behavior also conforms to the procedures defined in the 
   Section 6 of LDP Capabilities [RFC5561].
  
3.3. Procedures for Application Control capabilities in a Capability 
   message 

   If the LDP peer supports "Dynamic Announcement Capability" [RFC5561], 
   then an LDP speaker can send IP Label Switching and/or PW Signaling 
   capability in a Capability message. Once advertised, these 
   capabilities cannot be withdrawn and hence the S-bit of the TLV MUST 
   be set to 1 when sent in a Capability message.  

   An LDP speaker may decide to send this TLV towards an LDP peer if any 
   of its IP and/or L2VPN/PW signaling applications gets disabled, or if 
   previously disabled IP and/or L2VPN/PW applications gets enabled 
   again. In this case, LDP speaker constructs the TLVs with appropriate 
   application control bitmap and sends the corresponding capability 
   TLVs in a Capability message. Furthermore, the LDP speaker also 
   withdraws application(s) related advertised state (such as label 
   bindings) from its peer. 

   Upon receipt of those TLVs in a Capability message, the receiving LDP 
   speaker reacts in the same manner as it reacts upon the receipt of 
   those TLVs in an Initialization message. Additionally, the receiving 
   LDP speaker withdraws the application(s) related advertised state 
   (such as label bindings) from the sending LDP speaker. If the 
   receiving LDP speaker does not understand or support either Dynamic

   Announcement capability or received Application Control capability 
   TLV ("IP Label Switching" or "PW Signaling"), it MUST respond with 
   "Unsupported Capability" notification to the sender of the Capability 
   message.  

4. Operational Examples 

4.1. Disabling IP/PW label applications on an ICCP session 

   Consider two PE routers, LSR1 and LSR2, which understand/support "IP 
   Label Switching" and "PW Signaling" capability TLVs. These LSR have 
   an established LDP session due to ICCP application in order to 
   exchange ICCP state related to dual-homed devices connected to these 
   LSRs. Let us assume that LSR1 is provisioned not to exchange any 
   label bindings related to IP (v4/v6) prefixes and PW layer2 FEC 
   (FEC128/129) with LSR2. 
   
   To indicate its "disability" for the IP/PW applications, the LSR1 
   will include both the "IP Label Switching" capability TLV (with 
   bit0-1 of "Address Family Bitmap" set to 0) and "PW Signaling"  
   capability TLV (with E-bit set to 0) in the Initialization message. 
   Upon receipt of those TLVs in Initialization message, the LSR2 will 
   disable any IP/PW address/label binding state advertisement towards 
   LSR1 after session establishment.  

   The LSR1 will also disable any IP/PW address/label binding state 
   towards LSR2, irrespective of the fact whether or not LSR2 could 
   disable the corresponding application state advertisement towards 
   LSR1. 

4.2. Disabling IP Label Switching application on a L2VPN/PW session 

   Now, consider LSR1 and LSR2 have an established session due to 
   L2VPN/PW application just to exchange PW (FEC128/129) label 
   bindings for VPWS/VPLS services amongst them. Since in most typical 
   deployments, there is no need to exchange IP (v4/v6) address/label 
   bindings amongst the PE LSRs, let us assume that LSR1 is provisioned 
   to disable IP (v4/v6) application on given PW session towards LSR2.  

   To indicate its disability for IP application, the LSR1 will include 
   the "IP Label Switching" capability TLV in the Initialization 
   message with bit0-1 (IPv4, IPv6) in "Address Family Bitmap" set to 
   zero. Upon receipt of this TLV in Initialization message, the LSR2 
   will disable any IP address/label binding state advertisement 
   towards LSR1.

Internet-Draft          LDP IP and PW Capability              April 2011 
 

   The LSR1 will also disable any IP address/label binding state 
   towards LSR2, irrespective of the fact whether or not LSR2 could 
   disable the corresponding IP application state advertisement towards 
   LSR1. 

4.3. Disabling IP application dynamically on an established IP/PW 
   session 

   Assume that LSRs from previous sections were initially provisioned to 
   exchange both IP and PW state over the session between them, and also 
   support "Dynamic Announcement" capability [RFC5561]. Now, assume that 
   LSR1 is dynamically provisioned to disable IP label switching with 
   LSR2. In this case, LSR1 will first withdraw all its IP label state 
   by sending a single Label Withdraw message with IP Prefix Typed 
   Wildcard FEC using the mechanics described in [RFC5918], and Address 
   Withdraw message to withdraw its addresses. LSR1 will also send IP 
   Label Switching capability TLV in Capability message towards LSR2 
   with bit0-1 (IPv4, IPv6) in "Address Family Bitmap" set to zero. Upon 
   receipt of this TLV, LSR2 will also disable IP label switching 
   towards LSR1 and withdraw all previous IP application label/address 
   state using the same mechanics as described earlier for LSR1. The 
   disability of IP label switching dynamically should not impact 
   L2VPN/PW application on given session, and both LSRs should continue 
   to exchange PW Signaling application related state. 

5. Security Considerations 

  The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new 
  security considerations beyond that already apply to the base LDP 
  specification [RFC5036] and [RFC5920]. 
   
6. IANA Considerations 

  The document introduces following two new capability parameter TLVs 
  and requests following LDP TLV code point assignment by IANA: 
   
   o  "IP Label Switching" Capability TLV (requested codepoint: 0x50C) 

   o  "PW Signaling" Capability TLV       (requested codepoint: 0x50D)

7. Conclusions 

   The document proposed a solution using LDP Capabilities [RFC5561] 
   mechanics to disable unnecessary state exchange, if/as desired, 
   between LDP peers for currently non-negotiated IP/PW applications.

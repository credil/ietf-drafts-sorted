 Abstract

    The increasing deployment of both, IP multicast and mobility, rises
    the problem of delivering  IPv6 multicast traffic to mobile nodes.
    This document proposes an approach to the problem, named
    Decentralized Mobile Multicast, that combines tunnelling and dynamic
    subscription to the multicast groups. The proposed solution aims to
    reduce handover time, and to diminish the overhead produced
    by multicast subscriptions. As a consequence of the decentralized
    selection of multicast routers, a single point of failure is
    eliminated.

1. Introduction
 
    In the last years, there has been an increasing deployment of 
    multicast transmission in the Internet. Multicast protocols 
    consolidated, and a diversity of multicast applications appeared,
    each with different requirements of quality of service.
    The advent of mobility, imposes the challenge to develop new 
    solutions that enable to provide multicast service in mobile
    networks, maintaining QoS and scalability.
    These solutions have to be based on mobility support [2] and
    multicast protocols designed for stationary receivers and senders.
    Two basic approaches has been proposed in [2], MIP-BT and MIP-RS.
    MIP-BT  is based on the creation of a bidirectional tunnel between 
    the home agent and the MN. This approach does not generate overhead 
    due to reconnections to the multicast tree, but have the problems of
    tunnel convergence and excessive size of the multicast path.

    Additionally, the home agent becomes a single point of failure.
    MIP-RS proposes to join to the multicast tree each time a MN changes
    its L3 point of attachment. The multicast path is near to optimum, 
    but the overhead due to multiple reconnections to the multicast tree
    can cause loss of packets; additionally, the signalling overhead in
    the multicast tree can be significant.
    Other attempts try to combine the characteristics of MIP-BT and 
    MIP-RS to obtain better results, for example [3] [4] [5]. Most of
    these approaches are dedicated to multicast mobile receivers. The
    case of multicast mobile senders has been subject of less 
    researching effort.

    In this document, a solution for the case of mobile receivers is 
    proposed, which considers the following aspects:
    1- Tradeoff between the size of the multicast tunnel (MIP-BT) and
       the overhead caused by frequent subscriptions to the multicast
       tree (MIP-RS). The protocol must allow to select suitable values
       considering the conditions of the network, load in routers, and 
       the QoS required by the MNs. In this proposal, the decision
       process is carried out by the two routers that directly interact
       with the MN (AMR and LMR). No decision algorithm is proposed here
    2- Allow a MN to receive multicast datagrams, still in networks that
       do not support multicast traffic. We propose the use of an IPv6
       tunnel between an MN and its AMR to carry multicast data and 
       control information. The configuration of that tunnel only
       requires that the MN has obtained its CoA in its current network.
    3- Decreasing of handover latency. Handover is the process by which
       a MN changes its network point of attachment. It is composed by
       link layer handover (for example, change of AP);layer 3 handover,
       by which a MN obtains a new CoA, and registering handover 
       (binding update process), that enables the MN to communicate 
       with its home agent and with its correspondent nodes. Reduction 
       of handover latency is critical in certain applications, and in
       most of the cases improves QoS and diminishes packet loss.
       Additionally to the above mentioned, exists a delay due to
       the multicast process, produced by either the subscription to the
       group (MIP-RS)or by the configuration of the bidirectional tunnel
       (MIP-BT). In this proposal, total handover latency is composed by
       L2 handover, plus L3 handover (obtention of a CoA) plus the
       reconfiguration time of the tunnel between MN and its AMR.
    4- Negotiation of loss rate during handover process. According to 
       the QoS negotiated between MN and its AMR, this one will store 
       multicast datagrams addressed for G and send them immediately 
       after tunnel reconfiguration. That negotiation will have to be
       done whenever a MN changes of AMR. This proposal does not address
       aspects such as packet identification, detection of network point
       of attachement, etc.
    5- Elimination of points of failure. This is achieved with the
       dynamic selection of the routers that serve to the MN (AMR and
       LMR). In this way, points of failure such as Home Agents are 
       eliminated.

    6- Elimination of tunnel convergence. In this proposal, multiple 
       tunnels for a group G, between MNs and its respective Home 
       agents, are replaced by one tunnel between a selected AMR and the
       LMR of the network.
    7- Diminishing of the overhead caused by frequent joins to the
       multicast tree (respect to MIP-RS). Depending on the negotiation 
       among AMRs and LMRs, it is possible to configure parameters in
       such a way that wont produce joins each time that a MN changes
       of network.

  
2. Concepts and Operation Overview

    In our proposal we define two types of roles for the routers, active
    multicast router (AMR) and local multicast router (LMR).

    AMR: The AMR is the router that attaches to the multicast tree for a
    group G, based on the requirements of the MNs or the LMRs. The 
    joining is carried out according to the normal procedures of the 
    multicast protocol in use (for example PIM-SM [6]). A network (LMR)
    and the MNs attached to it, may be served by different AMRs.
    The AMR has the following functions:
    - To participate in the negotiation to select a new AMR for a 
      network
    - To set up a tunnel with each LMR of the networks that he serves.
      Through this tunnel, the AMR sends multicast data that the LMR
      injects in its local network.
    - To set up a tunnel with each MNs that he serves. Through this
      tunnel, the AMR sends multicast data to the MN, while the MN does
      not receive such data from the LMR (or multicast router) situated
      in its current network. 
    - To buffer multicast datagrams, to send them later to the MN after
      the handover process. The amount of buffered information depends
      on the negotiated QoS between the AMR and the MN.

    LMR: The LMR distributes multicast packets to the MNs located in its
    network. As explained above, the multicast datagrams can be received
    through a tunnel with the AMR or directly from the multicast tree
    (in this case, both roles, AMR and LMR, are performed by the router)
    The LMR has the following functions:
    - To distribute multicast data to the MNs located in his network.
    - To become in AMR or provide information about available AMRs to
      the MNs located in his network.
    - To participate in the negotiation to select a new AMR for the
      network.
    - To gather multicast control information (MLD) from its local
      network, to sum it up, and to send the result to the AMR.

    The following steps describe the actions of routers (acting as AMRs
    or LMRs) when a MN arrive in a network and joins a multicast group.

    1- MN1, currently attached to network N1, decides to join group G.
       He sends a modified unsolicited report [7] (see sect 4.2), 1-to
       request reception of datagrams addressed to G, and, 2-to solicit
       the local router (R1) either to act as AMR or to provide an AMR
       (the resulting AMR is the LMR if it is acting as AMR, or the
       current AMR of the network). 
    2-a. If  R1 does not recognize modified unsolicited reports, it 
         just joins G (if he was not) and begins to distribute multicast
         datagrams for G in the local network. Because there is not
         support to our approach in the network, the process ends.Later,
         MN1 will repeat this process when he moves to another network.
    2-b. If R1 recognizes modified unsolicited reports, in addition to
         begin to send multicast datagrams addressed to G in the local
         network, provides MN1 with a reference to an AMR (R1 itself or
         its current AMR -AMR1-) (this is done according to the state of
         R1 -see Table 1);. Continue with step 3.
    3- When MN1 gets the reference to AMR1, he initiates a process by
       which AMR1 becomes the AMR of MN1. This enable AMR1 to recognize
       to MN1 when he changes of network and, after the handover process
       ,tries to communicate with AMR1 to get the multicast datagrams
       that have arrived during handover time. 
    4- MN1 moves to network N2 and gets a new CoA. Immediately, MN1
       communicates with AMR1 to get multicast datagrams. AMR1 
       recognizes MN1 based on a unique identifier generated in step 3.
    5- MN1 begins to receive multicast datagrams from AMR1.
    6- As in step 1, MN1 sends a modified unsolicited report to the 
       local router, R2. 
    7-a. If  R2 does not recognize modified unsolicited, it just joins 
         G (if he was not) and begins to distribute multicast datagrams
         for G in the local network. 
    7-b. If R2 recognizes modified unsolicited reports, because the 
         report has a not null AMR identifier, R2 initiates a process to
         select an AMR for the network N2 (see Table 1). When this
         process ends, R2, acting as LMR for N2, will inform its local
         MNs about the selected AMR; each MN will decide either to 
         change its AMR or not. 
    8- When MN1 begins to receive multicast datagrams from the LMR (R2),
       he asks its AMR for stop the sending of multicast datagrams
       through the tunnel.
    9- The LMR (R2) announces the selected AMR to the MNs. Each MN will
       decide either to retain its current AMR or to request the new AMR
       to become its AMR.

 
3. Roles of routers

    Consider a router R1, and a network N1. R1 is either local (L) or
    remote (R) with respect to R1.
    Table 1 sums up the roles that the router R1 can assume 
    based in the following events: 1- the arriving of a MN (MN1) in N1
    and the result of the decision algorithm, and 2- the leaving of the

    last MN joined to G in N1. 
    When MN1 arrives in N1, a local router R1 can be performing the
    function of LMR, if it was selected previously as a consequence of a
    previous arriving. In addition, this router may be performing as AMR
    A router may have no state (NS) (no AMR neither LMR). This means 
    that the router still was not chosen to be LMR or AMR.
    Exists a unique LMR for the network; this router have to be local to
    N1. He is chosen when a MN arrives in N1 and tries to join a group 
    G, who is not been received in N1. This router maintains its state 
    of LMR until the last MN joined to G leaves the network. The LMR 
    must be capable to process MLD frames in the local network, to sum
    this up, and to send the result to the AMR of the network. 
    Exists a unique AMR for the network N1; this router may be either
    local or remote with respect to N1.The AMR for a network may change.

    The AMR must be capable to attach itself to the multicast tree.
    In Table 1, we show the change of state that routers do in 
    function of the events that appear in the first column. The first 
    row indicates the state of the router, previous to the event.         
    Intersections event/state, show the actions performed by the router,
    either as LMR or AMR. The last line indicates the new state of the
    router.
    NS means no state, i.e. the router is not LMR neither AMR.



4. Operation in the local network


 4.1 Exchange of information about AMRs.
        MNs and LMR exchange information about possibles AMRs. This 
        enable MNs and LMRs to select the appropriated AMR to his
        requirements.
        The selection is based on the decision algorithm running in each
        node; the AMR finally selected depends on the availability 
        of the AMRs.
        The exchange of information about AMRs is limited to each local
        network; possibles AMRs are the AMR of the network (if exists),
        the AMR of each MN and the LMR, if he is performing as AMR.
        The exchange of information about AMRs is limited to each local
        network; possibles AMRs are the AMR of the network (if exists),
        the AMR of each MN, and the LMR if he is acting as AMR.
        As stated, the information about AMRs is exchanged by means of
        modified reports issued by MNs and modified queries issued by 
        the LMR (querier). These queries and reports contain information
        needed to contact the AMR, to negotiate the creation of a tunnel
    4.2 Extended MLD Reports and Queries
        As stated in [7], in section 3.7, it is possible to send 
        additional information in queries and reports. The receiver
        detects such information because of the size of the frame.
        Figure 1 shows the additional fields we propose to add to 
        these frames.   
        These fields are the following:
        -Reserved: this 16 bits are reserved to identify the proposed
         extension and to carry some information about the capability 
         of the announced AMR (for example, QoS). This field would help
         MNs and LMRs to select the most appropriate AMR when they
         perform their decision process.
        -AMR port, AMR address: these two fields identify respectively
         the port and the address where the AMR receives requirements 
         to create, or eliminate tunnels.

       Figure 1 - Extended MLD Queries and reports

    4.3 Operation 
        In the local network the LMR is in charge to distribute 
        multicast datagrams to the MNs, and, as querier router, to
        exchange MLD frames with the MNs. The extended frames that are
        interchanged by LMR and MNs are interpreted correctly by
        stationary nodes receiving multicast datagrams and participating
        in MLD exchange.
        A MN who wishes to receive multicast data for a group G, emits
        an extended unsolicited report. If he is being served by an AMR,
        the additional fields of that report contains the address and 
        port of his AMR; if the MN has not yet an AMR, these fields are
        zeroed. 
        The querier router begins to assume his role of LMR when he
        receives for first time an extended unsolicited report, issued 
        by an MN. 
        The LMR, based on its decision algorithm and in the information
        contained in the unsolicited report, will either attach himself
        to the multicast tree (if not attached), or to contact the AMR 
        to negotiate the establishment of a tunnel.
        In both cases, when the MN begins to receive multicast data
        emitted by the LMR, he asks his AMR for stop the sending of data
        through the tunnel. 
        The AMR and the MNs periodically announce their AMR with the
        purpose that each of them can choose the best one for its
        requirements

5. Tunnels
    In order to interchange data and control information, bidirectional
    tunnels are established between each LMR and its AMR, and between 
    each MN and its AMR.

    For more information about the characteristics of these tunnels see
    [8].
    A protocol is needed for communication between MN (LMR) and AMR 
    through the tunnel. For simplicity, we define the same protocol for
    both kinds of tunnels; in the case AMR-LMR, the complete 
    functionality is not used. For a brief, non-formal description of 
    the protocol, see section 5.2.


 5.1 Establishment, reconfiguration and termination of tunnels.

    These operations (with exception of termination, see below) are 
    initiated by the node that solicits to be served (MN or LMR). He
    sends its requirement to the address (address and port published in
    extended reports and queries, as stated above) in which the AMR is
    listening, 
    Interchanged PDUs between MN (LMR) and AMR can be encapsulated 
    either in UDP or TCP.
    In the next sections, we will refer to the MN (LMR) as the tunnel
    client, and to the AMR as the tunnel server.


 5.1.1 Tunnel Establishment 
    This operation does not require security considerations.Any MN (LMR)
    that knows the address and port of an AMR, can require its services.
    Optionally, an AMR can be configured to accept only a set of clients
    In these cases, it is necessary to define the set of clients and to
    implement procedures to recognize its members.
    Immediately after the tunnel is established, security information is
    exchanged between the AMR and its client. This information will be
    used to identify the client when he changes its CoA and requires
    reestablishment of the tunnel.
    The establishment of the tunnel involves two PDUs, resulting in a 
    two-way delay. The client sends its requirement, containing its HoA
    (this identifies univoquely the client), its CoA, and a list of its 
    QoS requirements, if any. Each one is specified in TLV format, and
    includes the desired value and the minimum acceptable value.
    If the AMR cannot satisfy the minimum requirements, indicates this
    fact to the client, cancelling the request.
    In the case that the AMR have enough resources to satisfy the
    requirements, it sends a confirmation to the client, indicating, for
    each QoS parameter, the value granted (between the minimum and the
    desired). These values are specified in TLV format. 
    Simultaneously with the sending of the confirmation, the AMR sets up
    the tunnel. The traffic of the tunnel is protected using IPSec.
    Once the tunnel is established, the AMR sends a cipher key,its index
    in the table of the AMR, and two strings randomly generated; these
    elements will serve the AMR to securely identify the client when

    this solicit tunnel reestablishment using a new CoA.
   
 5.1.2 Tunnel reestablishment 
    This operation requires security measures to protect a client from
    impersonation on the part of a misbehaved host. He can impersonate
    the AMR or the client.
    In both cases, the client will not be able to communicate with
    the AMR, resulting in loss of data.
    The steps to re-establish the tunnel are the following. The client
    sends a requirement to re-establish the tunnel, to the address and
    port of the AMR. This message contains the HoA that identifies the
    client, the index associated with the cipher key, and the ciphered
    concatenation of HoA, CoA and the string1 provided by the AMR at
    tunnel establishment time.
    The AMR deciphers the information using the correspondent key, and
    checks its validity. If it is not valid, ignores the requirement. 
    In the case it is valid, he sends a response that includes the
    ciphered string2 (provided at tunnel establishment), to avoid AMR
    impersonation.
    Immediately after these verifications, the tunnel is reconfigured 
    and new security information is provided to the client for the next
    tunnel reestablishment. 

 5.1.3 Tunnel termination
    The completion of the tunnel happens by explicit requirement of one
    of the parts or by absence of activity in the channel (information,
    control or keep alives) during a time greater than the maximum
    configurated.
    Tunnel termination information travels through the tunnel, and
    therefore it does not require additional security considerations.

 5.2 Exchange of information
    Information exchanged through tunnels consists of multicast data,
    data control information and tunnel Management information.
    The AMR send each datagram to the client immediately after it
    arrives, and, when required by the client, send buffered datagrams
    received previously. In order to conserve the order of the 
    datagrams, each one is tagged with a sequence number.
    Data control information enables the client to stop (stop) or to
    start (start) the sending of data on the part of the AMR. It is
    also possible to request buffered datagrams (for example after
    reconnection of the MN) (continue); in this case, a number of
    tagged datagrams is sent, according to the negotiated QoS.
    Management information allows each endpoint to verify the state of
    the other. If an endpoint does not detect activity of the other for 
    a period of time greater than the contents of keepalive variable, it
    cancels the tunnel. This is done to recover unnecessary resources
    wasted in maintaining non used tunnels. The value of the keepalive
    timer must be negotiated at the establishment of a tunnel. In the
    case that a client is a MN, the handover time must be considered.

    An andpoint that is not sending data, must indicate its presence by
    sending keepalive at regular intervals.
    The PDUs exchanged are the following:
    - Data (AMR to LMR/MN): multicast datagrams for group G. Each Data
      has a sequence number that indicates the order in wich it was
      received by the AMR.
    - Start (MN/LM to AMR): The client asks for the AMR that initiates
      (or continue, if it was stopped) the transfer of multicast data.
    - Stop (MN/LMR to AMR): The client asks for the AMR that stops the
      data transfer through the tunnel. The MN asks for it to the AMR
      when it has begun to receive native multicast data through 
      the network to which it is connected.
      The LMR asks for it to the AMR when in spite of not having more
      members of group G in its local network, it wishes to conserve the
      tunnel.
    - Continue (MN to AMR): The MN asks for the AMR to send buffered
      data. It indicates the sequence number of the first datagram it
      wishes to receive. Typically, this is used by the MN after a
      handover.
    - Alive (bidirectional): Periodically exchanged between client 
      and server, when there is no activity in the channel.
    - Cancel (bidirectional): Used by either the client or the server to
      terminate the tunnel. The MN should send a cancel when it leaves
      group G. The AMR could send a cancel as a consequence of lack
      of resources.


6. State in routers and MNs
    Routers that plays roles of AMR or LMR, must have multicast capacity
    The AMR must be able to attach to a multicast tree, executing the
    multicast protocol of the domain. The LMR must be able to process 
    MLD information.
    A router can act simultaneously like AMR and LMR for the same
    group. In this case the implementation of the tunnel is internal,
    and depends on the implementation.

    The state maintained by each node is the following:

    - AMR:
      For each tunnel:
       a- Multicast Group 
       b- Local Endpoint (interface address)
       c- Remote Endpoint (MN CoA or LMR Address)
       d- Tunnel state (sending/stopped)
       e- Number of buffers assigned to store multicast datagrams
       f- Pointer to the older datagram stored in buffers
       g- Pointer to the last datagram stored in buffers (the last
          received)
       h- Cancel timer: It contains the remaining time after which the

          tunnel will be cancelled due inactivity of the remote endpoint
          This timer is restarted each time activity of the remote
          endpoint is detected. 
       i- Keepalive Timer: It contains the remaining time after wich 
          this node must send a keepalive to indicate activity to the
          remote endpoint. This timer is restarted each time this node
          sends a message to the remote endpoint.

       If the remote endpoint is a MN, the AMR keeps variables 
       associated with security. These are the following:
       j- Idx: Index of the key used to cipher information in the
          handshake for tunnel reestablishment.
       k- String1, string2: Random generated strings for authentication
          of both, client and server.
       l- HoA: MN s Home Address. It serves as a univoque identification
          of the MN.
       m- CoA: last MN s Care of Address known by the AMR.

    - LMR
      For each tunnel:
       a- Multicast Group 
       b- Local Endpoint (interface address)
       c- Remote Endpoint (AMR Address)
       d- Tunnel state (sending/stopped)
       e- Local interface towards the MNs
       f- MLD information relative to the interface towards the MNs.

    - MN
       a- Multicast Group 
       b- Local Endpoint (interface address)
       c- Remote Endpoint (AMR Address)
       d- Tunnel state (sending/stopped)
       e- Cancel timer: It contains the remaining time after which the
          tunnel will be cancelled due inactivity of the remote endpoint
          This timer is restarted each time activity of the remote
          endpoint is detected. 
       f- Keepalive Timer: It contains the remaining time after wich
          this node must send a keepalive to indicate activity to the
          remote endpoint. This timer is restarted each time this node
          sends a message to the remote endpoint.
       g- Idx: Index of the key used to cipher information in the
          handshake for tunnel reestablishment.
       h- cipher key
       i- String1, string2: Random generated strings for authentication
          of both, client and server.
       j- HoA: MN s Home Address.
       k- CoA: last MN s Care of Address (current if it is attached to a
          network)
       l- pCoA: previous CoA.

7. AMR selection algorithm (LMR)`

    Each LMR decides either to become the client of one of the AMRs
    announced by the MNs attached to its network, or becomes itself AMR,
    attaching itself to the multicast tree. The decision is based mainly
    on the resulting overhead in the multicast tree. This algorithm is
    not considered in this document. 

8.AMR selection algorithm (MN)

    Each MN select its AMR between its current AMR or one of the
    announced by its LMR. The selection is based on QoS (tunnel size,
    datagrams buffered, etc.). This algorithm is not considered in this
    document. 

9. Security Considerations

    Security must be considered in the establishment, the reestablish
    ment and the termination of tunnels; it must involve mutual
    authentication, integrity protection, and protection against replay
    attacks.
    In addition, confidentiality is needed for the information that is
    sent through the tunnels, since it involves control and management
    information.
    - Tunnel establishment: It can be allowed to any MN to connect 
      itself to an AMR; in this case security measures are not needed. 
      If an AMR wishes to restrict its possible clients, it must use an
      authentication mechanism.
    - Tunnel re-establishment: Security must be implemented to avoid 
      impersonation of both, MN and AMR. See section 5.1.2.
    - Tunnel termination: This operation only involves traffic sent 
      through the tunnel. It is enough to assure the information that is
      sent through the tunnel.
    - Information sent through the tunnel: It is assured using security
      headers provided by IPv6.


10. Conclusions
    This document has presented an approach to deliver IPv6 multicast
    data to mobile nodes. The main characteristics of this proposal are
    the following:
    -Flexibility : A MN can decide which of the known AMRs satisfies
    better its requirements (delay, amount of buffered datagrams, etc.).
    A router can decide to join itself to the multicast tree or to 
    attach itself to other router acting as AMR, in function of network
    resources and charge on the router. All these decisions depend on 
    the MN s decision algorithm and the AMR s decision algorithm
    respectively.
    -Deployment: A MN is able to receive multicast data when visiting

Internet Draft       Decentralized Mobile Multicast        December 2009 



    areas that have not multicast support.
    -Elimination of single points of failure: a MN does not depend on 
    a central point (for example the home agent) to receive multicast
    data; if it results disconnected of its AMR, it can reconnect with
    another router acting as LMR in its current network. 
    -Efficiency: acting as LMR, a router eliminates the problem of 
    tunnel convergence if several MNs joined to the same multicast group
    are attached to his network. With respect to the overhead due to
    joining to the multicast tree, routers can decide to do it or
    not, since they know the AMRs of the MNs attached to the network.
    -Reduction of handover latency: a MN can re-establish the tunnel 
    with its AMR, immediately after obtaining a new CoA.

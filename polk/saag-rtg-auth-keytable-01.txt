1  Introduction

   This document describes the application of a database of long-lived
   cryptographic keys, as defined in [KEYTAB], to establish session-
   specific cryptographic keys to provide authentication services in
   routing protocols.  Keys may be established between two peers for
   pair-wise communications, or between groups of peers for multicast
   traffic.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Figure 1 illustrates the establishment and use of cryptographic keys
   for authentication in routing protocols.  Long-lived cryptographic
   keys are inserted in a database manually.  In the future, we
   anticipate an automated key management protocol to insert these keys
   in the database. In this future environment, we do not anticipate an
   environment where the automated key management protocol will be used
   to create short-lived cryptographic session keys.  The structure of
   the database of long-lived cryptographic keys is described in
   [KEYTAB].

   The cryptographic keying material for individual sessions is derived
   from the keying material stored in the database of long-lived
   cryptographic keys.  A key derivation function (KDF) and its inputs
   are named in the database of long-lived cryptographic keys; session
   specific values based on the routing protocol are input the the KDF. 
   Protocol specific key identifiers may be assigned to the
   cryptographic keying material for individual sessions if needed.

   session with a peer.  As one step in the initiation process, the
   intitator requests the set of long term keys associated with the peer
   for the particular protocol.  If the set contains more than one key,
   the initiator selects one long-term key based on the local policy. 
   The long-term key is provided as an input, along with session-
   specific information (e.g., ports or initial counters), to a key
   derivation function.  The result is session-specific key material
   which is used to generate cryptographic authentication.

   Where the initiator is establishing a multicast session, the Peer in
   the key request identifies the set of systems that will receive this
   information.

   Figure 3 illustrates how an entity that receives a session generates
   the necessary long-lived cryptographic keys to verify data when a
   protected session is requested.  As step one in the initiation
   process, the receiver extracts the keyID for the long-term keyID from
   the received data.  The receiver then requests the specified long-
   term key from the table. The long-term key is provided as an input,
   along with session-specific information (e.g., ports or initial
   counters), to a key derivation function.  The result is session-
   specific key material which is used to verify the cryptographic
   authentication information.

4 Identifier Mapping

   [KEYTAB] specifies a 16-bit identifier, but protocols already exist
   with key identifiers of various sizes.  Where the identifiers are of
   different sizes, an extra mapping step may be required.  Note that
   mapping mechanisms are local - that is, different mapping mechanisms
   could be employed on different peers. 

   In practice, the mapping process need only be applied to the
   LocalKeyID, whose value must be unique in the context of the

   database, as defined in [KEYTAB].  Uniqueness is not required for the
   PeerKeyID, so mapping is generally restricted to truncation.  Mapping
   would only be needed to expand PererKeyID's value beyond 16 bits.

4.1 Selected Range Reservation

   Where a protocol uses an index of less than 16 bits, a selected range
   of the local index space can be reserved for a particular protocol. 
   For example, consider two protocols P1 and P2 that each use 8 bit key
   identifiers.   Without identifier mapping these protocols would share
   the space {0x0000 through 0x00ff} which would limit the pair of
   protocols to 256 keys in total.  By reserving the ranges {0x7f00
   through 0x7fff} and {0x7e00 through 0x7eff} for P1 and P2
   respectively permits each protocol to use the full 256 key
   identifiers and establishes an unambiguous mapping for the protocol
   key identifiers and local table identifiers.

   When an initiator selects a key from the set in the table, the given
   key identifier needs to be masked or shifted to the on-the-wire
   range.  Before requesting a specific key, the receiver would use a
   shim layer would need to map the on-the-wire identifier into the
   reserved range.

4.2 Protocol Specific Mapping Tables

   Each protocol can also maintain a simple mapping table with two
   fields: the l6 bit index and the protocol specific value

   KEYTAB index (16 bits)   |  Protocol specific index (8 bits)

   In this case, the host system would maintain separate mapping tables
   for protocols P1 and P2.

5 Worked Example: TCP-AO

   This section describes the way a TCP-AO implementation could use the
   database. [tcpao] TCP-AO protocol is an example where the key
   identifier is limited to 8 bits, so an identifier mapping is needed.

   We will assume two peers Xp and Yp.  Xp employs the range reservation
   method for mapping and has reserved the range {0x7f00 ... 0x7fff} for
   LocalKeyIDs for TCP-AO, mapping to {0x00 ... 0xff}.   Yp employs a
   protocol specific mapping table in its TCP-AO implementation. 

   The following subsections describe how peers Xp and Yp make use of
   the database of long-lived cryptographic keys when Xp and Yp
   respectively initiate a session.  (Note: Rollover to new sessions
   keys during a session is described in [tcpao].)

INTERNET DRAFT                                           19 October 2009


5.1 Setup
   The owners of Xp and Yp determine a need for authenticated
   communication using TCP-AO. They decide to use AES-CMAC-128 for
   authentication, so a 128 bit key is needed.  They decide to use the
   same key for both directions (inbound and outbound), and that the key
   will be available from 12/31/2010 through 12/31/2011. Through an out-
   of-band channel, the administrators establish the shared secret:
        0x0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF  
   Peer Xp selects the first available TCP-AO identifier in the reserved
   range, which is 0x7f05 and maps to an eight bit identifier 0x05. 
   Peer Yp selects the next available TCP-AO identifier, 0x12, and the
   next available LocalKeyID, which is 0x0107.  Peer Yp also adds an
   entry to its TCP-AO mapping table mapping the LocalKeyID to the TCP-
   AO identifier, as shown in Figure 5:

   LocalKeyID     TCP-AO identifier
   --------------------------------
   0x001a      |    0x01
   0x004d      |    0x02
     ...            ...
   0x0107      |    0x12

   Figure 5. Protocol Specific KeyID Mapping Table for TCP-AO

   After exchanging the TCP-AO identifiers, the peers have sufficient
   information to establish their [KEYTAB] entries.  Peer Xp's [KEYTAB]
   entry is shown as Figure 6:

5.2 Protocol Operation: Xp Initiates a Connection

   Peer Xp wishes to initiate a connection with Peer Yp.

   (1) Xp performs a key lookup for {Peer=Yp, Protocol=TCP-AO}, and the
   entry with LocalKeyID 0x7f05 is returned.
   (2) The LocalKeyID 0x7f05 is range mapped by Xp to the TCP-AO
   identifier 0x05.
   (3) Xp performs the session key derivation using the mechanism
   specified for the TCP-AO protocol in [ao-crypto].
   (4) Xp generates the AES-CMAC-128 MACs for the outgoing traffic using
   the derived key, and asserts the key identifier 0x05 in the packets.
   (5) Yp receives a protected packet from Xp, and extracts the key
   identifier 0x05.
   (6) Yp performs a a key lookup for {Peer=Xp, Protocol=TCP-AO,
   PeerKeyID=0x05}, and the entry with LocalKeyID 0x0107 is returned.
   (7) Yp performs the session key derivation using the mechanism
   specified for the TCP-AO protocol in [ao-crypto].
   (8) Yp verifies the MACs for the incoming traffic using the derived
   key.

5.3 Protocol Operation: Yp Initiates a Connection 

   Where Peer Yp establishes the connection, the same process is
   followed, except that range mapping process from step (2) is replaced
   by a table lookup.

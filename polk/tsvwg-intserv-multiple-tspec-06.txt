Abstract

   This document defines extensions to Integrated Services (IntServ) 
   allowing  multiple traffic specifications and multiple flow 
   specifications to be conveyed in the same Resource Reservation 
   Protocol (RSVPv1) reservation message exchange. This ability helps 
   optimize an agreeable bandwidth through a network between endpoints 
   in a single round trip.

1.  Introduction  

   This document defines how Integrated Services (IntServ) [RFC2210] 
   includes multiple traffic specifications and multiple flow 
   specifications in the same Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVPv1) 
   [RFC2205] message. This ability helps optimize an agreeable 
   bandwidth through a network between endpoints in a single round 
   trip.  

   There is a separation of function between RSVP and IntServ, in 
   which RSVP does not define the internal objects to establish 
   controlled load or guarantee services. These are generally left to 
   be opaque in RSVP.  At the same time, IntServ does not require 
   that RSVP be the only reservation protocol for transporting both 
   the controlled load or guaranteed service objects - but RSVP does 
   often carry the objects anyway.  This makes the two independent - 
   yet related in usage, but are also frequently talked about as if 
   they are one and the same. They are not.  

   The 'traffic specification' contains the traffic characteristics of 
   a sender's data flow and is a required object in a PATH message. The
   TSPEC object is defined in RFC 2210 to convey the traffic 
   specification from the sender and is opaque to RSVP. The ADSPEC 
   object - for 'advertising specification' - is used to gather 
   information along the downstream data path to aid the receiver in 
   the computation of QoS properties of this data path. The ADSPEC is 
   also opaque to RSVP and is defined in RFC 2210. Both of these 
   IntServ objects are part of the Sender Descriptor  [RFC2205].

   Once the Sender Descriptor is received at its destination node, 
   after having traveled through the network of routers, the 
   SENDER_TSPEC information is matched with the information gathered in
   the ADSPEC, if present, about the data path. Together, these two 
   objects help the receiver build its flow specification (encoded in 
   the FLOWSPEC object) for the RESV message. The RESV message 
   establishes the reservation through the network of routers on the 
   data path established by the PATH message.  If the ADSPEC is not 
   present in the Sender_Descriptor, it cannot aid the receiver in 
   building the flow specification.

   The SENDER_TSPEC is not changed in transit between endpoints (i.e., 
   there are no bandwidth request adjustments along the way). However, 
   the ADSPEC is changed, based on the conditions experienced through 
   the network (i.e., bandwidth availability within each router) as the
   RSVP message travels hop-by-hop.  
   
   Today, real-time applications have evolved such that they are able 
   to dynamically adapt to available bandwidth, not only by dropping 
   and adding layers, but also by reducing frame rates and resolution. 
   It is therefore limiting to have a single bandwidth request in 
   Integrated Services, and by extension, RSVP.

   With only one traffic specification in a PATH message and only one 
   flow specification in a RESV message (with some styles of 
   reservations a RESV message may actually contain multiple flow 
   specifications, but then there is only one per sender), applications
   will either have to give up altogether on session establishment in 
   case of failure of the reservation establishment for the highest 
   "bandwidth or will have to resort to multiple successive RSVP 
   signaling attempts in a trial-and-error manner until they finally 
   establish the reservation a lower "bandwidth". These multiple 
   signaling round-trip would affect the session establishment time and
   in turn would negatively impact the end user experience.

   The objective of this document is to avoid such roundtrips as well 
   as allow applications to successfully receive some level of 
   bandwidth allotment that it can use for its sessions. 

   While the ADSPEC provides an indication of the bandwidth available 
   along the path and can be used by the receiver in creating the 
   FLOWSPEC, it does not prevent failures or multiple round-trips as 
   described above.  The intermediary routers provide a best attempt 
   estimate of available bandwidth in the ADSPEC object. However, it 
   does not take into account external policy considerations 
   (RFC 2215). In addition, the available bandwidth at the time of 
   creating the ADSPEC may not be available at the time of an actual 
   request in an RESV message. These reasons may cause the RESV message
   to be rejected. Therefore, the ADSPEC object cannot, by itself, 
   satisfy the requirements of the current generations of real-time 
   applications. 

   It needs to be noted that the ADSPEC is unchanged by this new 
   mechanism. If ADSPEC is included in the PATH message, it is 
   suggested that the receiver use this object in determining 
   the flow specification.

   This document creates a means for conveying more than one 
   "bandwidth" within the same RSVP reservation set-up (both PATH and 
   RESV) messages to optimize the determination of an agreed upon 
   bandwidth for this reservation.  Allowing multiple traffic 
   specifications within the same PATH message allows the sender to 
   communicate to the receiver multiple "bandwidths" that match the 
   different sending rates that the sender is capable of transmitting 
   at.  This allows the receiver to convey this multiple "bandwidths" 
   in the RESV so those can be considered when RSVP makes the actual 
   reservation admission into the network. This allows the applications
   to dynamically adapt their data stream to available network 
   resources. 

   The concept of RSVP signaling is shown in a single direction below, 
   in Figure 1.  Although the TSPEC is opaque to RSVP, it is shown 
   along with the RSVP messages for completeness. The RSVP messages 
   themselves need not be the focus of the reader.  Instead, the 
   number of round trips it takes to establish a reservation is the

    Figure 2. Concept of RSVP Rejection due to Limited Bandwidth

   The scenario above is where multiple TSPEC and multiple FLOWSPEC 
   optimization helps. The Sender may support multiple bandwidths 
   for a given application (i.e., more than one codec for voice or 
   video) and therefore might want to establish a reservation with the 
   highest (or best) bandwidth that the network can provide for a 
   particular codec.

   For example, bandwidths of: 

       12Mbps, 
        4Mbps, and 
        1.5Mbps 

   for the three video codecs the Sender supports.

   This document will discuss the overview of the proposal to include 
   multiple TSPECs and FLOWSPECs RSVP in section 2. In section 3, the 
   overview of the entire solution is provided. This section also 
   contains the new parameters which are defined in this document. The 
   multiple TSPECs in a PATH message and the multiple FLOWSPEC in a 
   RESV message, both for controlled load and guaranteed service are 
   described in this section. Section 4 will cover the rules of usage 
   of this IntServ extension. This section contains how this document 
   needs to extend the scenario of when a router in the middle of a 
   reservation cannot accept a preferred bandwidth  (i.e., FLOWSPEC), 
   meaning previous routers that accepted that greater bandwidth now 
   have too much bandwidth reserved. This requires an extension to RFC 
   4495 (RSVP Bandwidth Reduction) to cover reservations being 
   established, as well as existing reservations. Section 4 also 
   includes the merging rules.


2.  Overview of Proposal for Including Multiple TSPECs and FLOWSPECS 


   Presently, this is the format of a PATH message [RFC2205]:

           <PATH Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]

                                     <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>

                                     <TIME_VALUES>

                                    [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]

                                    [ <sender descriptor> ]

           <sender descriptor> ::= <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                    [ <ADSPEC> ]

   where the SENDER_TSPEC object contains a single traffic 
   specification.
   
   For the PATH message, the focus of this document is to modify the 
   <sender_descriptor> in such a way to include more than one traffic 
   specification.  This solution does this by retaining the existing 
   SENDER_TSPEC object above, highlighted by the '^^^^' characters, and
   complementing it with a new optional MULTI_TSPEC object to convey 
   additional traffic specifications in this PATH message. No other 
   object within the PATH message is affected by this IntServ 
   extension.

   This extension modifies the sender descriptor by specifically 
   augmenting it to allow an optional <MULTI_TSPEC> object after the 
   optional <ADSPEC>, as shown below.

Internet-Draft            IntServ MULTI_TSPEC                  Mar 2011

           <sender descriptor> ::= <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                                                      
                                    [ <ADSPEC> ]  [ <MULTI_TSPEC> ]
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^

   As can be seen above, the MULTI_TSPEC is in addition to the 
   SENDER_TSPEC - and is only to be used, per this extension, when 
   more than one TSPEC is to be included in the PATH message.

   Here is another way of looking at the proposal choices:


            +---------------------+
            |   Existing TSPEC    |
            |                     |
            |    +----------+     |
            |    |  TSPEC1  |     |
            |    +----------+     |
            |                     |
            +---------------------+

            +---------------------+
            |  Additional TSPECs  |
            |                     |
            |  +---------------+  |
            |  |  MULTI_TSPEC  |  |
            |  |    Object     |  |
            |  |  +--------+   |  |
            |  |  | TSPEC2 |   |  |
            |  |  +--------+   |  |
            |  |  +--------+   |  |
            |  |  | TSPEC3 |   |  |
            |  |  +--------+   |  |
            |  |  +--------+   |  |
            |  |  | TSPEC4 |   |  |
            |  |  +--------+   |  |
            |  +---------------+  |
            |                     |
            +---------------------+

    Figure 3. Encoding of Multiple Traffic Specifications in 
              the TSPEC and MULTI_TSPEC objects

   
   This solution is backwards compatible with existing implementations 
   of [RFC2205] and [RFC2210], as the multiple TSPECs and FLOWSPECs are
   inserted as optional objects and such objects do not need to be 
   processed, especially if they are not understood. 

   This solution defines a similar approach for encoding multiple flow 
   specifications in the RESV message. Flow specifications beyond the 
   first one can be encoded in a new "MULTI_FLOWSPEC" object contained

Internet-Draft            IntServ MULTI_TSPEC                  Mar 2011

   in the RESV message. 

   In this proposal, the original SENDER_TSPEC and the FLOWSPEC are 
   left untouched, allowing routers not supporting this extension to 
   process the PATH and the RESV message without issue. Two new 
   additional objects are defined in this document. They are the 
   MULTI_TSPEC and the MULTI_FLOWSPEC for the PATH and the RESV 
   message, respectively. The additional TSPECs (in the new MULTI_TSPEC
   Object) are included in the PATH and the additional FLOWSPECS (in 
   the new MULTI_FLOWSPEC Object) are included in the RESV message as 
   new (optional) objects. These additional objects will have a class 
   number of 11bbbbbb, allowing older routers to ignore the object(s) 
   and forward each unexamined and unchanged, as defined in section 
   3.10 of [RFC 2205]. 

   NOTE: it is important to emphasize here that including more than 
         one FLOWSPEC in the RESV message does not cause more than one 
         FLOWSPEC to be granted. This document requires that the 
         receiver arrange these multiple FLOWSPECs in the order of 
         preference according to the order remaining from the 
         MULTI_TSPECs in the PATH message. The benefit of this 
         arrangement is that RSVP does not have to process the rest of 
         the FLOWSPEC if it can admit the first one.


3.  Multi_TSPEC and MULTI_FLOWSPEC Solution

 
   For the Sender Descriptor within the PATH message, the original 
   TSPEC remains where it is, and is untouched by this IntServ 
   extension. What is new is the use of a new <MULTI_TSPEC> object

   - preferred TSPEC is in the original SENDER_TSPEC

   - the next in line preferred TSPEC is the first TSPEC in the 
     MULTI_TSPEC object

   - the next in line preferred TSPEC is the second TSPEC in the

   - and so on...

   The composition of the flow descriptor list in a Resv message 
   depends upon the reservation style. Therefore, the following shows

3.1 New MULTI_TSPEC and MULTI-RSPEC Parameters

   This extension to Integrated Services defines two new parameters 
   They are:
   
   1. <parameter name> Multiple_Token_Bucket_Tspec, with a parameter 
      number of 125.  

   2. <parameter name> Multiple_Guaranteed_Service_RSpec with a 
      parameter number of 124

   These are IANA registered in this document.  

   The original SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC for Controlled Service 
   maintain the <parameter name> of Token_Bucket_Tspec with a parameter
   number of 127.  The original FLOWSPEC for Guaranteed Service 
   maintains the <parameter name> of Guaranteed_Service_RSpec with a 
   parameter number of 130.

   each TSPEC.   
   
   The Service header, here service number 5 (Controlled-Load) MUST 
   remain the same.  

   Each TSPEC is six 32-bit Words long (the per-service header plus the 
   5 values that are 1 Word each in length), therefore the length is in 
   6 Word increments for each additional TSPEC.  Case in point, from 
   the above Figure 5, Words 3-8 are the first TSPEC (2nd preferred), 
   Words 9-14 are the next TSPEC (3rd preferred), and Words 15-20 are 
   the final TSPEC (and 4th preferred) in this example of 3 TSPECs in 
   this MULTI_TSPEC object.  There is no limit placed on the number of 
   TSPECs a MULTI_TSPEC object can have. However, it is RECOMMENDED to 
   administratively limit the number of TSPECs in the MULTI_TSPEC 
   object to 9 (making for a total of 10 in the PATH message).

   The TSPECS are included in the order of preference by the message 
   generator (PATH) and MUST be maintained in that order all the way to
   the Receiver. The order of TSPECs that are still grantable, in 
   conjunction with the ADSPEC at the Receiver, MUST retain that 
   order in the FLOWSPEC and MULTI_FLOWSPEC objects.

   The Service header, here service number 5 (Controlled-Load) MUST 
   remain the same for the RESV message.  The services, Controlled-Load 
   and Guaranteed MUST NOT be mixed within the same RESV message. In 
   other words, if one TSPEC is a Controlled Load service TSPEC, the 
   remaining TSPECs MUST be Controlled Load service. This same rule 
   also is true for Guaranteed Service - if one TSPEC is for Guaranteed

   Service, the rest of the TSPECs in this PATH or RESV MUST be for 
   Guaranteed Service.

   The Length of controlled-load data (d) also increases to account for
   the additional TSPECs.

   Each FLOWSPEC is six 32-bit Words long (the per-service header plus 
   the 5 values that are 1 Word each in length), therefore the length 
   is in 6 Word increments for each additional TSPEC.  Case in point, 
   from the above Figure 5, Words 3-8 are the first TSPEC (2nd 
   preferred), Words 9-14 are the next TSPEC (3rd preferred), and Words
   15-20 are the final TSPEC (and 4th preferred) in this example of 3 
   TSPECs in this FLOWSPEC.  There is no limit placed on the number of 
   TSPECs a particular FLOWSPEC can have. 

   Within the MULTI_FLOWSPEC, any SENDER_TSPEC that cannot be reserved 
   - based on the information gathered in the ADSPEC, is not placed in 
   the RESV or based on other information available to the receiver.  
   Otherwise, the order in which the TSPECs were in the PATH message 
   MUST be in the same order they are in the FLOWSPEC in the RESV.  
   This is the order of preference of the sender, and MUST be 
   maintained throughout the reservation establishment, unless the 
   ADSPEC indicates one or more TSPECs cannot be granted, or the 
   receiver cannot include any TSPEC due to technical or administrative
   constraints or one or more routers along the RESV path cannot grant 
   a particular TSPEC.  At any router that a reservation cannot honor a
   TSPEC, this TSPEC MUST be removed from the RESV, or else another 
   router along the RESV path might reserve that TSPEC.  This rule 
   ensures this cannot happen.

   Once one TSPEC has been removed from the RESV, the next in line 
   TSPEC becomes the preferred TSPEC for that reservation.  That router 
   MUST generate a ResvErr message, containing an ERROR_SPEC object 
   with a Policy Control Failure with Error code = 2 (Policy Control 
   Failure), and an Error Value sub-code 102 (ERR_PARTIAL_PREEMPT) to 
   the previous routers, clearing the now over allocation of bandwidth 
   for this reservation.  The difference between the previously 
   accepted TSPEC bandwidth and the currently accepted TSPEC bandwidth 
   is the amount this error identifies as the amount of bandwidth that 
   is no longer required to be reserved.  The ResvErr and the RESV 
   messages are independent, and not normally sent by the same router. 
   This aspect of this document is the extension to RFC 2205 (RSVP).

   If a RESV cannot grant the final TSPEC, normal RSVP rules apply with
   regard to the transmission of a particular ResvErr.


3.4 Multiple FLOWSPEC for Guaranteed service

   The FLOWSPEC object, which is used to request guaranteed service 
   contains a TSPEC and RSpec. Here is the FLOWSPEC object from

   There MUST be 1 RSPEC per TSPEC for Guaranteed Service. Therefore, 
   there are 5 words for Receiver TSPEC and 3 words for the RSPEC. 
   Therefore, for Guaranteed Service, the TSPEC/RSPEC combination 
   occurs in increments of 8 words.


4.  Rules of Usage

   The following rules apply to nodes adhering to this specification:


4.1 Backward Compatibility

   If the recipient does not understand this extension, it ignores this
   MULTI_TSPEC object, and operates normally for a node receiving this 
   RSVP message.


4.2 Applies to Only a Single Session

   When there is more than one TSPEC object or more than one FLOWSPEC 
   object, this MUST NOT be considered for more than one flow created. 
   These are OR choices for the same flow of data. In order to attain 
   three reservations between two endpoints, three different 
   reservation requests are required, not one reservation request with 
   3 TSPECs.  


4.3 No Special Error Handling for PATH Message

   If a problem occurs with the PATH message - regardless of this 


Polk & Dhesikan        Expires September 14, 2011             [Page 17]
Internet-Draft            IntServ MULTI_TSPEC                  Mar 2011

   extension, normal RSVP procedures apply (i.e., there is no new 
   PathErr code created within this extension document) - resulting in 
   a PathErr message being sent upstream towards the sender, as usual.


4.4 Preference Order to be Maintained

   When more than one TSPEC is in a PATH message, the order of TSPECs 
   is decided by the Sender and MUST be maintained within the 
   SENDER_TSPEC. The same order MUST be carried to the FLOWSPECs by 
   the receiver. No additional TSPECS can be introduced by the receiver 
   or any router processing these new objects. The deletion of TSPECs 
   from a PATH message is not permitted. The deletion of the TSPECs 
   when forming the FLOWSPEC is allowed by the receiver in the 
   following cases:

   - If one or more preferred TSPECs cannot be granted by a router as 
     discovered during processing of the ADSPEC by the receiver, then 
     they can be omitted when creating the FLOWSPEC(s) from the TSPECs.

   - If one or more TSPECs arriving from the sender is not preferred by
     the receiver, then the receiver MAY omit any while creating the 
     FLOWSPEC.  A good reason to omit a TSPEC is if, for example, it 
     does not match a codec supported by the receiver's application(s).
     
   The deletion of the TSPECs in the router during the processing of 
   this MULTI_FLOWSPEC object is allowed in the following cases:

   - If the original FLOWSPEC cannot be granted by a router then the 
     router may discard that FLOWSPEC and replace it with the topmost 
     FLOWSPEC from the MULTI_FLOWSPEC project. This will cause the 
     topmost FLOWSPEC in the MULTI_FLOWSPEC object to be removed. The 
     next FLOWSPECs becomes the topmost FLOWSPEC.

   - If the router merges multiple RESV into a single RESV message, 
     then the FLOWSPEC and the multiple FLOWSPEC may be affected

   The preferred order of the remaining TSPECs or FLOWSPECs MUST be 
   kept intact both at the receiver as well as the router processing 
   these objects.


4.5  Bandwidth Reduction in Downstream Routers

   If there are multiple FLOWSPECs in a single RESV message, it is 
   quite possible that a higher bandwidth is reserved at a previous 
   downstream device. Thus, any device that grants a reservation that 
   is not the highest will have to inform the previous downstream 
   routers to reduce the bandwidth reserved for this particular 
   session. 

   The bandwidth reduction RFC [RFC4495] has the ability to partially 


Polk & Dhesikan        Expires September 14, 2011             [Page 18]
Internet-Draft            IntServ MULTI_TSPEC                  Mar 2011

   preempt existing reservations. However, it does not address the need
   that this draft addresses.  RFC 4495 defines an ability to preempt 
   part of an existing reservation so as to admit a new incoming 
   reservation with a higher priority, in lieu of tearing down the 
   whole reservation with lower priority. It does not specify the 
   capability to reduce the bandwidth a RESV set up along the data path
   before the reservation is realized (from source to destination), 
   when a subsequent router cannot support a more preferred FLOWSPEC 
   contained in that RESV.  This document will extend the RFC 4495 
   defined error to work for previous hops while a reservation is being
   established.

4.6 Merging Rules

   RFC 2205 defines the rules for merging as combining more than one 
   FLOWSPEC into a single FLOWSPEC. In the case of MULTI_FLOWSPECs, 
   merging of the two  (or more) MULTI_FLOWSPEC MUST be done to arrive 
   at a single MULTI_FLOWSPEC. The merged MULTI_FLOWSPEC will contain 
   all the flow specification components of the individual 
   MULTI_FLOWSPECs in descending orders of bandwidth.  In other words, 
   the merged FLOWSPEC MUST maintain the relative order of each of the 
   individual FLOWSPECs.  For example, if the individual FLOWSPEC order
   is 1,2,3 and another FLOWSPEC is a,b,c, then this relative ordering 
   cannot be altered in the merged FLOWSPEC.  

   A byproduct of this is the ordering between the two individual 
   FLOWSPECs cannot be signaled with this extension.  If two (or more) 
   FLOWSPECs have the same bandwidth, they are to be merged into one 
   FLOWSPEC using the rules defined in RFC 2205.  It is RECOMMENDED 
   that the following rules are used for determining ordering (in TSPEC
   and FLOWSPEC):

      For Controlled Load - in descending order of BW based on the 
      Token Bucket Rate 'r' parameter value

      For Guaranteed Service - in descending order of BW based on the 
      RSPEC Rate 'R' parameter value

   The resultant FLOWSPEC is added to the MULTI_FLOWSPEC based on its 
   bandwidth in descending orders of bandwidth. 

   As a result of such merging, the number of FLOWSPECs in a 
   MULTI_FLOWSPEC object should be the sum of the number of FLOWSPECs 
   from individual MULTI_FLOWSPEC that have been merged *minus* the 
   number of duplicates. 


4.7 Applicability to Multicast

   An RSVP message with a MULTI_TSPEC works just as well in a multicast
   scenario as it does in a unicast scenario. In a multicast scenario, 
   the bandwidth allotted in each hop is the lowest bandwidth that can 


Polk & Dhesikan        Expires September 14, 2011             [Page 19]
Internet-Draft            IntServ MULTI_TSPEC                  Mar 2011

   be admitted along the various path. For example:


   +--------+       +----------+      +----------+      +------------+
   | sender |======>| Router-1 |=====>| Router-2 |=====>| Receiver-A |
   +--------+       +----------+      +----------+      +------------+
                         |                 |
                         |                 |
                         |                 V
                         |           +------------+
                         |           | Receiver-C |
                         |           +------------+
                         |                 
                         V
                  +------------+
                  | Receiver-B |
                  +------------+

          Figure 8. MULTI_TPSEC and Multicast

   If the sender (in Figure 8) sends 3 TSPECs (i.e., 1 TSPEC Object, 
   and 2 in the MULTI_TSPEC Object) of 12Mbps, 5Mbps and 1.5Mbps.  Let 
   us say the path from Receiver-B to Router-1 admitted 5Mbps, 
   Receiver-C to Router-2 admitted 1.5Mbps and Receiver-A to Router-2 
   admitted 12Mbps.  

   When the Resv message is send upstream from Router-2, the combining 
   of 1.5Mbps (to Receiver-C) and 12Mbps (to Receiver-A) will be 
   resolved to 1.5Mbps (lowest that can be admitted). Only a Resv with 
   1.5Mbps will be sent upstream from Router-2.  Likewise, at Router-1,
   the combining of 1.5Mbps (to Router-2) and 5Mbps (to Receiver-B) 
   will be resolved to 1.5Mbps units. 

   This is to allow the sender to transmit the flow at a rate that can 
   be accepted by all devices along the path. Without this, if Router-2
   receives a flow of 12Mbps, it will not know how to create a flow of 
   1.5Mbps down to Receiver-B. A differentiated reservation for the 
   various paths along a multicast path is only possible with a 
   Media-aware network device (MANE). The discussion of MANE and how it
   relates to admission control is outside the scope of this draft.


4.8 MULTI_TSPEC Specific Error

   Since this mechanism is backward compatible, it is possible that a 
   router without support for this MULTI_TSPEC extension will reject a 
   reservation because the bandwidth indicated in the primary FLOWSPECs
   is not available. This means that an attempt with a lower bandwidth 
   might have been successful, if one were included in a MULTI_TSPEC 
   Object. Therefore, one should be able to differentiate between an 
   admission control error where there is insufficient bandwidth when 
   all the FLOWSPECs are considered and insufficient bandwidth when 


Polk & Dhesikan        Expires September 14, 2011             [Page 20]
Internet-Draft            IntServ MULTI_TSPEC                  Mar 2011

   only the primary FLOWSPEC is considered.

   This requires the definition of an error code within the ERROR_SPEC 
   Object. When a router does not have sufficient bandwidth even after 
   considering all the FLOWSPEC provided, it issues a new "MULTI_TSPEC 
   bandwidth unavailable " error. This will be an Admission Control 
   Failure (error #1), with a subcode of 6.  A router that does not 
   support this MULTI_TSPEC extension will return the "requested 
   bandwidth unavailable" error as defined in RFC 2205 as if there was 
   no MULTI_TSPEC in the message.


4.9 Other Considerations

   - RFC 4495 articulates why a ResvErr is more appropriate to use for 
     reducing the bandwidth of an existing reservation vs. a ResvTear.

   - Refreshes only include the TSPECs that were accepted. One SHOULD 
     be sent immediately upon the Sender receiving the RESV, to 
     ensure all routers in this flow are synchronized with which TSPEC 
     is in place.

   - Periodically, it might be appropriate to attempt to increase the 
     bandwidth of an accepted reservation with one of the TSPECs that 
     were not accepted by the network when the reservation was first 
     installed.  This SHOULD NOT occur too regularly.  This document 
     currently offers no guidance on the frequency of this bump request
     for a rejected TSPEC from the PATH.


4.10 Known Open Issues

   Here are the know open issues within this document:

   o  Both the idea of MULTI_RSPEC and MULTI_FLOWSPEC need to be 
      fleshed out, and IANA registered.

   o  Need to ensure the cap on the number of TSPECs and FLOWSPECs is 
      viable, yet controlled.


5.  Security considerations

   The security considerations for this document do not exceed what is 
   already in RFC 2205 (RESV) or RFC 2210 (IntServ), as nothing in 
   either of those documents prevent a node from requesting a lot of 
   bandwidth in a single TSPEC.  This document merely reduces the 
   signaling traffic load on the network by allowing many requests that 
   fall under the same policy controls to be included in a single 
   round-trip message exchange.

   Further, this document does not increase the security risk(s) to

Internet-Draft            IntServ MULTI_TSPEC                  Mar 2011

   that defined in RFC 4495, where this document creates additional 
   meaning to the RFC 4495 created error code 102.

   A misbehaving Sender can include too many TSPECs in the 
   MULTI_TSPEC object, which can lead to an amplification attack. That 
   said, a bad implementation can create a reservation for each TSPEC 
   received from within the Resv message. The number of TSPECs in the 
   new MULTI_TSPEC object is limited, and the spec clearly states that 
   only a single reservation is to be set up per Resv message.

Appendix A: Alternatives for Sending Multiple TSPECs 

   This appendix describes the discussion within the TSVWG of which 
   approach best fits the requirements of sending multiple TSPECs 
   within a single PATH or RESV message.  There were 3 different 
   options proposed, of which - 2 were insufficient or caused more harm

   than other options.

   Looking at the format of a PATH message [RFC2205] again:

           <PATH Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]

                                     <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>

                                     <TIME_VALUES>

                                    [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]

                                    [ <sender descriptor> ]

           <sender descriptor> ::= <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                    [ <ADSPEC> ]

   For the PATH message, the focus of this document is with what to do 
   with respect to the <SENDER_TSPEC> above, highlighted by the '^^^^' 
   characters. No other object within the PATH message will be affected 
   by this IntServ extension.

   The ADSPEC is optional in IntServ; therefore it might or might not 
   be in the RSVP PATH message.  Presently, the SENDER_TSPEC is limited
   to one bandwidth associated with the session.  This is changed in 
   this extension to IntServ to multiple bandwidths for the same 
   session. There are multiple options on how the additional bandwidths
   may be added:

   Option #1 - creating the ability to add one or more additional 
               (and complete) SENDER_TSPECs,
   
   or 

   Option #2 -  create the ability for the one already allowed 
                SENDER_TSPEC to carry more than one bandwidth amount 
                for the same reservation.

   or 

   Option #3 -  create the ability for the existing SENDER_TSPEC to 
                remain unchanged, but add an optional <MULTI_TSPEC> 
                object to the <sender descriptor> such as this:

           <sender descriptor> ::= <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                                                      
                                    [ <ADSPEC> ]  [ <MULTI_TSPEC> ]
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^

   Here is another way of looking at the option choices:

    Figure 3. Concept of Option Choice

   Option #1 and #2 do not allow for backward compatibility. If the 
   currently used SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects are changed, then 
   unless all the routers requiring RSVP processing are upgraded, this 
   functionality cannot be realized. As it is unlikely that all routers
   along the path will have the necessary enhancements as per this 
   extension at one given time, therefore, it is necessary this 
   enhancement be made in a way that is backward compatible. Therefore,
   option #1 and option #2 has been discarded in favor of option #3, 
   which had WG consensus in a recent IETF meeting.

   Option #3: This option has the advantage of being backwards 
   compatible with existing implementations of [RFC2205] and [RFC2210],
   as the multiple TSPECs and FLOWSPECs are inserted as optional 
   objects and such objects do not need to be processed, especially if 
   they are not understood. 

   Option#3 applies to the FLOWSPEC contained in the RESV message as 
   well. In this option, the original SENDER_TSPEC and the FLOWSPEC are
   left untouched, allowing routers not supporting this extension to be
   able to process the PATH and the RESV message without issue. Two new
   additional objects are defined in this document. They are the 
   MULTI_TSPEC and the MULTI_FLOWSPEC for the PATH and the RESV 
   message, respectively. The additional TSPECs (in the new MULTI_TSPEC
   Object) are included in the PATH and the additional FLOWSPECS (in 
   the new MULTI_FLOWSPEC Object) are included in the RESV message as 
   new (optional) objects. These additional objects will have a class 
   number of 11bbbbbb, allowing older routers to ignore the object(s)

   and forward each unexamined and unchanged, as defined in section 
   3.10 of [RFC 2205]. 

   We state in the document body that the top most FLOWSPEC of the new 
   MULTI_FLOWSPEC Object in the RESV message replaces the existing 
   FLOWSPEC when it is determined by the receiver (perhaps along 
   with the ADSPEC) that the original FLOWSPEC cannot be granted. 
   Therefore, the ordering of preference issue is solved with Option#3 
   as well.

   NOTE: it is important to emphasize here that including more than 
         one FLOWSPEC in the RESV message does not cause more than one 
         FLOWSPEC to be granted. This document requires that the 
         receiver arrange these multiple FLOWSPECs in the order of 
         preference according to the order remaining from the 
         MULTI_TSPECs in the PATH message. The benefit of this 
         arrangement is that RSVP does not have to process the rest of 
         the FLOWSPEC if it can admit the first one.

   Additional details of these options can be found in the 
   draft-polk-tsvwg-...-01 version of this appendix (which includes the 
   RSVP bit mapping of fields in the TSPECs, if the reader wishes to 
   search for that doc.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the payload format for packetization of audio
   data encoded with the Standard apt-X or Enhanced apt-X audio coding
   algorithms into the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  [RFC3550].

   The document outlines some conventions, a brief description of the
   operating principles of the audio codecs, and the payload format
   capabilities.  The detailed RTP payload format is specified and a
   relevant example of the format is provided.  The media type, its
   mappings to the SDP [RFC4566] and its usage in the SDP offer/answer
   model is also specified.  Finally, some security considerations are
   outlined.

   This document registers a media type (audio/aptx) for the RTP payload
   format for the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X audio codecs.

2.  Conventions

   This document uses the normal IETF bit-order representation.  Bit
   fields in figures are read left to right and then down.  The leftmost
   bit in each field is the most significant.  The numbering starts from
   0 and ascends, where bit 0 will be the most significant.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X Codecs

   Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X are proprietary audio coding
   algorithms licensed by APT Licensing Ltd and widely deployed in a
   variety of audio processing equipment.  For commercial reasons, the
   detailed internal operation of these algorithms is not described in
   standards or reference documents.  However, the data interface of an
   implementation of either codec algorithm is very simple and allows
   easy RTP packetization without a particularly detailed knowledge of
   the coded audio stream syntax.

   Both the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coding algorithms are
   based on Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation principles.
   They both produce a constant coded bit rate scaled according to the
   sample frequency of the uncoded audio.  This constant rate is 1/4 of
   the bit rate of the uncoded audio, irrespective of the resolution
   (number of bits) used to represent an uncoded audio sample.  For
   example, a 1.536 Mbit/s stereo audio stream composed of 2 channels of
   16-bit Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) samples at a sample rate of 48 kHz
   is encoded at 384 kbit/s.

   The Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X algorithms can carry an
   auxiliary data channel and synchronisation information within the
   coded audio data without additional overhead.  Hence the RTP payload
   format is unaffected by the presence or absence of the optional
   auxiliary data channel, which can be used to transport non-audio data
   or timecode information for synchronisation with video.  The bit rate
   of the auxiliary data channel is 1/4 of the sample frequency, for
   example at Fs = 48 kHz bit rate of the auxiliary data stream is 12
   kbit/s.  The auxiliary data stream is fed into the Standard apt-X or
   Enhanced apt-X encoder implementation as separately from the uncoded
   audio data.  Similarly the decoded audio data and recovered auxiliary
   data appear on separate outputs of a Standard apt-X or Enhanced apt-X
   decoder implementation.

   The Standard apt-X algorithm encodes 4 successive 16-bit PCM samples
   from each audio channel into a single 16-bit coded sample per audio
   channel.  The Enhanced apt-X algorithm encodes 4 successive 16-bit or
   24-bit PCM samples from each audio channel and produces a single 16-
   bit or 24-bit coded sample per channel.  A similar RTP packetisation
   mechanism is applied for each of these algorithmic variations.  Note
   that both Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X do not enforce a coded
   frame structure and the coded data syntax is a continuous coded
   sample stream, with each sample capable of regenerating 4 PCM samples
   upon decoding.

4.  Payload Format Capabilities

   This RTP payload format carries an integer number of Standard apt-X
   or Enhanced apt-X coded audio samples.  When multiple related audio
   channels are being conveyed within the payload, each channel
   contributes the same integer number of apt-X coded audio samples to
   the total number of samples carried by the payload.

4.1.  Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC)

   Generic forward error correction schemes for RTP such as RFC 2198
   [RFC2198] and RFC 5109 [RFC5109] have been defined.  Such generic and
   media-unaware schemes can be used to add redundant information to the
   RTP packet stream and make it more resilient to packet losses, at the
   expense of a higher bit rate.  Neither Standard apt-X nor Enhanced
   apt-X provides any specific form of redundancy or error-control
   coding.

5.  Payload Format

   The Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X algorithms encode 4 successive
   PCM samples from each audio channel and produce a single compressed
   sample for each audio channel.  The encoder SHALL be presented with
   an integer number S of input audio samples, where S is an arbitrary
   multiple of 4.  The encoder will produce exactly S/4 coded audio
   samples.  Since each coded audio sample is either 16 or 24 bits, the
   amount of coded audio data produced upon each invocation of the
   encoding process will be an integer number of bytes.  RTP
   packetisation of the encoded data SHALL be on a byte-by-byte basis.

5.1.  RTP Header Usage

   Utilisation of the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coding
   algorithms does not create any special requirements with respect to
   the contents of the RTP packet header.  The timestamp used in the RTP
   header shall comply with the timestamp specified in RFC 3550
   [RFC3550].  Other RTP packet header fields are defined as follows.

   o  V - As per [RFC3550]

   o  P - As per [RFC3550]

   o  X - As per [RFC3550]

   o  CC - As per [RFC3550]

   o  M - As per [RFC3550]

   o  PT - Payload Type to be defined according to MIME allocation:
      audio/aptx

   o  SN - As per [RFC3550]

   Header field abbreviations are defined as follows.

      V - Version Number

      P - Padding

      X - Extensions

      CC - Count of contributing sources

      M - Marker

      PT - Payload Type

      PS - Payload Structure

5.2.  Payload Structure

   The RTP payload data for Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X SHALL be
   structured as follows.  The number of audio channels associated with
   an individual audio stream MUST be either 1 or an integer multiple of
   2 and is hereafter referred to as a channel group.  Within a channel
   group consisting of more than 1 channel, successive pairs of channels
   are considered together and hereafter referred to as channel pairs.
   When considering the formation of channel pairs, standard audio
   channel ordering within a channel group MUST be used, for example the
   left channel precedes the right for stereo and 5.1 audio uses the
   channel ordering Front Left, Front Right, Front Centre, Low
   Frequency, Back Left and Back Right.

   The packet payload MUST consist of an integer number of a basic data
   unit hereafter referred to as a sample block.  Sample blocks are
   successively packed into the packet payload.  Each sample block
   consists of a fixed number of coded bytes and each channel in a
   channel group contributes an identical number of coded bytes N to
   each sample block.  N is calculated as the number of conceptual 64
   kbit/s streams represented by the total coded bit rate of the audio
   signal.  For example, N=6 when transmitting a 384 kbit/s coded audio
   stream and N=9 when transmitting a 576 kbit/s coded audio stream.
   Hence the total number of bytes in each sample block is the product N
   x C, where C is the number of channels in a channel group.  Data
   ordering within a sample block SHALL be as follows.  The sample block
   contribution from each channel pair SHALL be packed into the sample
   block in channel pair order.  The sample block contribution from each
   channel pair SHALL be formed by interleaving corresponding coded
   samples from the 2 channels in the channel pair, beginning with the
   first sample in time from the first channel.  Individual coded
   samples SHALL be packed into the payload in a byte-by-byte fashion,
   with most significant sample byte first.  Individual bytes SHALL be
   packed most significant bit first.

5.3.  Implementation Considerations

   An application implementing this payload format MUST understand all
   the payload parameters that is defined in this specification.  Any
   mapping of the parameters to a signaling protocol MUST support all
   parameters.  Hence, an implementation always can decide whether it is
   capable of communicating under the assumption that the communicating
   entities support this specification.

6.  Payload Example

   As an example payload format, consider the transmission of an
   arbitrary 5.1 audio signal consisting of 6 channels of 24-bit PCM
   data sampled at a rate of 48 kHz.  The total bit rate before audio
   coding is 6 * 24 * 48000 = 6.912 Mbits/s.  Applying Enhanced apt-X
   coding, with a coded sample size of 24 bits, results in a transmitted
   coded bit rate of 1/4 of the uncoded bit rate, i.e. 1.728 Mbit/s.
   Hence, the value of N defined in the previous section is N = 1728 /
   64 = 27 bytes, thereby specifying that 27 coded bytes, or
   equivalently 9 coded samples are placed into each sample block from
   each audio channel.  Channel ordering within a sample block is taken
   to be the standard 5.1 ordering of Front Left (FL), Front Right (FR),
   Front Centre (FC), Low Frequency (LF), Back Left (BL) and Back Right
   (BR).  This results in 3 channel pairs.  The first pair consists of
   FL and FR, in that channel order.  The second pair consists of FC and
   LF, in that channel order.  The third pair consists of BL and BR, in
   that channel order.

   For the example format, the diagram below indicates the order that
   coded bytes are placed into the packet payload in terms of sample
   byte significance.  Note that the following abbreviations are used.

      MSB:
      Most Significant Byte of a 24-bit coded sample

      MB:
      Middle Byte of a 24-bit coded sample

      LSB:
      Most Significant Byte of a 24-bit coded sample


   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   For the example format, the diagram below indicates how the
   contribution that a channel pair makes to each sample block of coded
   data is placed into the packet payload.  The coded samples, with byte
   ordering outlined in the previous diagram, are packed in terms of the
   channel ordering within the channel pair and the sample time index.
   Note that each channel contributes 9 coded samples to the sample
   block and that the following abbreviations are used.

7.  Payload Format Parameters

   This RTP payload format is identified using the media type audio/
   aptx, which is registered in accordance with RFC 4855 [RFC4855] and
   using the template of RFC 4288 [RFC4288]

7.1.  Media Type Definition

   Registration of media subtype audio/aptx.

      MIME media type name: audio

      MIME subtype name: aptx

      Required parameters:

         rate:
         RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sampling rate
         in Hz.  The typical rate is 48000, but other rates may be
         specified.

         channels:
         How many logical audio channels are present in an audio stream.
         Defaults to 2 (stereo).

         variant:
         The variant of apt-X (i.e.  Standard or Enhanced) that shall be
         used.  The following variants can be signalled:

            variant=standard
            variant=enhanced

         bitresolution:
         The number of bits used by the algorithm to encode 4 PCM
         samples.  This value may only be set to 16 for Standard apt-X
         and 16 or 24 for Enhanced apt-X.


      Optional parameters:

         ptime:
         The recommended length of time (in milliseconds) represented by
         the media in a packet.  See Section 6 of [RFC4566].

         maxptime:
         The maximum length of time (in milliseconds) that can be
         encapsulated in a packet.  See Section 6 of [RFC4566].

         aux:
         Indicates the transportation method of the auxiliary data
         discussed in Section 3.  Allowed values are:

            aux=off
            No aux data present.

            aux=embedded
            Aux data embedded within the primary audio stream.

            aux=ip-aux
            Aux data transmitted on a separate ip stream.  If this value
            is set then aux-port parameter MUST also be present.

         If the aux parameter is omitted then it is assumed that no
         auxiliary data is available.

         aux-port:
         Indicates the port on which aux data can be received.  This
         parameter MUST be present when aux value is set to "ip-aux", in
         all other cases this value MUST NOT be used.

      Encoding considerations: This type is only defined for transfer
      via RTP [RFC3550].

      Security considerations: See Section 5 of [RFC4855] and Section 4
      of [RFC4856].

      Interoperability considerations: none

      Published specification: RFC XXXX

      Applications which use this media type: Audio streaming

7.2.  Mapping to SDP

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] that is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP

Internet-Draft              apt-X RTP Format               December 2009


   is used to describe sessions the media type mappings are as follows.

      The type name ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

      The subtype name ("aptx") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
      name.

      The parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as clock rate.

      The parameter "channels" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as channel count.

      The required parameters "variant" and "bitresolution" MUST be
      included in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute and MUST follow the
      delivery-method that applies.

      The optional parameters "aux", "aux-port", and "maxptime" when
      present, MUST be included in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute and MUST
      follow the delivery-method that applies.

      The parameter "ptime", when present, goes in a separate SDP
      attribute field and is signalled as "a=ptime:<value>", where
      <value> is the number of millseconds of audio represented by one
      RTP packet.  See Section 6 of [RFC4566].

7.2.1.  SDP Usage Example

   The following example shows a basic SDP description of a single audio
   stream.  The first configuration packet is inlined in the SDP, other
   configurations could be fetched at any time from the first provided
   uri, or all the known configuration could be downloaded using the
   second uri.

      c=IN IP4 192.0.2.24

      m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 98

      a=rtpmap:98 aptx/44100/2

      a=fmtp:98 variant=enhanced; bitresolution=24; aux=ip-aux; aux-
      port=4000;

      a=ptime:4

   Note that parameter names are case-insensitive both in media types
   and in the mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

7.2.2.  Offer/Answer Considerations

   The only negotiable parameter is the delivery method.  All other
   parameters are declarative.  The offer, as described in [RFC3264],
   may contain a large number of delivery methods per single fmtp
   attribute, the answerer MUST remove every delivery method and
   configuration uri not supported.  Apart from this exceptional case,
   all parameters MUST NOT be altered on answer.

8.  IANA Considerations

   One media type (audio/aptx) has been defined and needs registration
   in the media types registry.  See Section 7.1

9.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550], and any appropriate RTP profile (for example
   [RFC3551]).  This implies that confidentiality of the media streams
   is achieved by encryption.  Because the audio coding used with this
   payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed
   after audio coding so there is no conflict between the two
   operations.  A potential denial-of-service threat exists for audio
   coding techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end computational
   load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams into the stream
   which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to be overloaded.
   However, the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X audio coding
   algorithms do not exhibit any significant non-uniformity.  As with
   any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may be
   overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either desired
   or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to discard
   packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of the
   authentication itself may be too high.  In a multicast environment,
   pruning of specific sources may be implemented in future versions of
   IGMP [RFC3376] and in multicast routing protocols to allow a receiver
   to select which sources are allowed to reach it.

Internet-Draft  Discussion of the API for KARP framework       July 2010


1.  Introduction

   The karp working group aims to secure the packets on the wire of the
   routing protocol exchanges (i.e. it addresses Keying and
   Authentication for Routing Protocols).

   Currently, there are a variety of routing protocols, and their
   requirements for authentication mechanisms are different.  To address
   it, the karp working group categorizes routing protocols into groups,
   and believes that the groupings will have like requirements for their
   authentication mechanisms, and that reuse of authentication
   mechanisms will be greatest within these grouping.

   [draft-ietf-karp-design-guide-00] defines four types of messaging
   transactions used on the wire by the base Routing Protocol (i.e.
   One-to-One, One-to-Many, peer keying, group keying).  This document
   focuses on One-to-One peer keying scenario, in which a one-to-one,
   unique keying security association (SA) is to be established between
   the two routers.

   For the One-to-One peer keying scenario, there are a variety of
   keying material definitions.  Every routing protocol security
   mechanism defines its own set of keying materials.  So it is hard for
   the KMP to take all those keying material sets into count.  To
   address this, it is desired to split the kmp design work into two
   parts: generic security association (GSA) establishment, and GSA
   conversion.  For the generic security association (GSA) establishment
   part, the KMP just generates generic keying materials (i.e.  GSA),
   and puts it into the KeyStore, which may be used by one or more
   protocols.  For the GSA conversion part, the keystore-to-
   routingprotocol API converts GSA to specific keying materials (we
   name it Routing SA) required by specific routing protocol security
   mechanisms.

   By splitting the kmp design work into two parts, the kmp designers
   need only focus on the management of GSA, and the keystore-to-
   routingprotocol API designers need only focus on the generating of
   specific keying material for specific routing protocol security
   mechanisms.  Therefore, both of these two tasks are simplified.
   [draft-karp-sa-def-00] discussed the definition of GSA.  However, it
   does not define the use of GSA in the karp framework
   [draft-ietf-karp-framework-00], where the GSA is generated by the
   KMP, used by routing protocol security mechanisms.

   This document focuses on the definition of APIs, which specifies the
   use of GSA and is a bridge among kmp, KeyStore, and specific routing
   protocol security mechanisms.

Internet-Draft  Discussion of the API for KARP framework       July 2010


2.  APIs in the Karp framework

   There are mainly three kinds of APIs which are described in the
   [draft-ietf-karp-framework-00].  The functions for these APIs are
   described as follows:

2.1.  KMP-to-RoutingProtocol API

   KMP-to-RoutingProtocol API is responsible for communicating between
   KMP function and routing protocol security mechanism entity.  When
   routing protocol security mechanism entity needs session key material
   to protect routing protocol traffic, it triggers KMP functions to
   create SA.  When KMP entity creates GSA successfully, KMP will call
   KeyStore-to-RoutingProtocol API for storing GSA to KeyStore entity.

2.2.  KeyStore-to-RoutingProtocol API

   KeyStore-to-RoutingProtocol API is responsible for communicating
   between KeyStore entity and routing protocol security mechanism
   entity.  When routing protocol security mechanism entity needs
   session key material to protect routing protocol traffic, it will
   inquire Routing SA, if GSA exists, routing protocol security
   mechanism entity convert GSA to Routing SA and fetches session key
   material from Routing SA to protect routing protocol traffic.  If
   there is not corresponded GSA, routing protocol security mechanism
   entity requires KeyStore entity to create GSA.

   If the session key material in Routing SA is timeout, KeyStore entity
   updates the session key material by generating new Routing SA and
   sending it to routing protocol security mechanism entity.

2.3.  KMP-to-KeyStore API

   KMP-to-KeyStore API is responsible for communicating between KMP
   function and KeyStore entity.  During authentication procedure, KMP
   function may get authentication information from KeyStore entity.
   When authentication is finished successfully, KMP function creates
   GSA and sends it to KeyStore function.


3.  KMP-to-RoutingProtocol API

   The function Call (GSA update call) is defined in this API.

3.1.  GSA_create_call()

   This function mainly aims to trigger to create GSA.  When router
   wants to use session key material to protect routing protocol packets

Internet-Draft  Discussion of the API for KARP framework       July 2010


   but can not find the right Routing SA, it calls this function to
   create GSA.

      Inputs:

      o RouterInfoType RouterInfo

      Outputs:

      o STATUSTYPE major_status,

      o GenericSAInfoType GenericSAInfo

      STATUSTYPE is integer type.

      Return major_status codes:

      GenericSA_create_Success indicates the GSA is created
      successfully.

      GenericSA_create_Fail indicates the GSA is not created.

      GenericSAInfoType includes the SA Identifier by which router
      fetches the right routing SA.


4.  KeyStore-to-RoutingProtocol API

   Two call functions are defined, i.e., RTSA_update_call() and
   RTSA_inquire_call ().

4.1.  RTSA_inquire_call ():

   This function mainly focuses on inquiring Routing SA to protect the
   routing protocol packets.  When router wants to use session key
   material to protect routing protocol packets and finds that there is
   Routing SA for routing protocol packets, router uses this function to
   get Routing SA and fetches key material from Routing SA.  When
   KeyStore entity receives this function call, it finds the right GSA
   and converts to routing SA and sends it to routing protocol
   mechanism.

      Inputs:

      o RoutingSAIDType routingSA_ID,

      o RoutingType routingtype

Internet-Draft  Discussion of the API for KARP framework       July 2010


      RoutingSAIDType is the ID attribute for Routing SA.  The
      routingSA_ID is used to find the right Routing SA.

      RoutingType is the type of Routing protocol.

      Outputs:

      o STATUSTYPE major_status,

      o RoutingSAType routingSAcreateHandle

      STATUSTYPE is integer type.

      Return major_status codes:

      RoutingSA_inquire_Success indicates that Routing SA is found.

      RoutingSA_inquire_Fail indicates that no Routing SA is found.

4.2.  RTSA_update_call ():

   This function mainly focuses on updating Routing SA to getting new
   session key material.  The session key material used for routing
   protocol packets is not valid anymore (i.e. the lifetime is timeout).
   Routing SA gets new session key material by calling this function.

      Inputs:

      o RoutingSAType routingSAcreateHandle

      o RoutingProtocolType routingprotocoltype

      Outputs:

      o STATUSTYPE major_status,

      o RoutingSAType routingSAcreateHandle

      STATUSTYPE is integer type.

      Return major_status codes:

      RoutingSA_update_Success indicates that Routing SA is updated
      successfully.

      RoutingSA_ update_Fail indicates that Routing SA fails in
      updating.  In this case, router needs to call RTSA_create_call ()
      to get new Routing SA.

4.3.  RTSA_create_call ():

   This function mainly focuses on creating Routing SA.  When router
   fails to update routing SA, router needs to call RTSA_create_call ()
   to get new Routing SA.

      Outputs:

      o STATUSTYPE major_status,

      o RoutingSAType routingSAcreateHandle

      STATUSTYPE is integer type.

      Return major_status codes:

      RoutingSA_ create_Success indicates that Routing SA is created
      successfully.

      RoutingSA_ create_Fail indicates that Routing SA fails in
      creation.


5.  KMP-to-KeyStore API

   Two call functions are defined, i.e., GSA_create_call () and
   Key_inquire_call ().

5.1.  GSA_create_call ():

   This function mainly focuses on creating GSA.  When authentication is
   finished, KMP function generates parameters for GSA, and uses
   GSA_create_call () to create GSA and send GSA to KeyStore entity.

      Inputs:

      o RoutingSAType routingSAcreateHandle

      o RoutingProtocolType routingprotocoltype

      Outputs:

      o STATUSTYPE major_status,

      o RoutingSAType routingSAcreateHandle

      STATUSTYPE is integer type.

      Return major_status codes:

      GenericSA_create_Success indicates that GSA is created
      successfully.

      GenericSA_create_Fail indicates that GSA fails to create.

5.2.  Key_inquire_call ():

   This function mainly focuses on retrieving key material in KeyStore
   entitiy.  During authentication, KMP function uses Key_inquire_call
   () to fetch key material in KeyStore entity for authentication and
   generating such parameters as session key materials for ROUTING SA.

      Inputs:

      o RouterID routerID

      routerID is router information used in authentication.

      Outputs:

      o STATUSTYPE major_status,

      o AuthenticationHandle authenticationHandle

      STATUSTYPE is integer type.

      Return major_status codes:

      RoutingSA_Success indicates that Router Key information is fetched
      successfully.

      RoutingSA_Fail indicates that Routing Key information fails to be
      fetched.

      AuthenticationHandle:

      authenticationHandle is key material for authentication
      information.


6.  The transfer from GSA to Routing SA

6.1.  Generic SA

   GSA is generated by KMP and can be used for routing protocol security
   mechanism.  Since the security associations for all routing protocol

   security mechanism are different, GSA could be designed appropriately
   so that it can be fit for all kinds of routing protocol security
   mechanism.  The simple way to deal with GSA is that GSA should be the
   superset for all the routing protocol security association.

   GSA includes the elements as follows:

      Key_ID: the security association ID.

      Auth_Alg_ID: The AlgID field indicates which authentication
      algorithm to be used with the security protocol for the specified
      peer.

      KDF_ID: The KDF field indicates which key derivation function is
      used to generate short-lived keys from the long-lived value in the
      Key field.

      KDF_inputs: The KDF_inputs field stores supplementary data for
      KDF.

      Key: The KDF field stores the symmetric cryptographic key.

      Lifetime: This field indicates the lifetime for key.

      Some attributes are used to specific routing protocol.  Whether
      all of these attributes should be added to GSA is needed to be
      considered later.  These attributes are as follows:

      Auth_len: this field indicates the length of authentication
      header.  This field is optional.

      KeyStartAccept: The time that the router will start accepting
      packets which have been created with the given key.  This field is
      optional.

      KeyStartGenerate: The time that the router will start using the
      key for packet generation.  This field is optional.

      KeyStopGenerate: The time that the router will stop using the key
      for packet generation.  This field is optional.

      KeyStopAccept: The time that the router will stop accepting
      packets which have been created with the given key.  This field is
      optional.

      Connection_ID: this field indicates the connection attributes.
      The attribute can be used to generate session key material.  This
      field is optional.

6.2.  Routing SA

   Routing SA is converted from Generic SA.  Some of GSA attributes such
   as key_ID, Auth_Alg_ID, lifetime can be copied to Routing SA
   directly.  Some of Routing SA attribute is derived from GSA such as
   Key. Session key can be derived based on KDF_ID, KDF inputs and key
   in GSA.  According to specific routing protocol, the Routing SA gets
   different attributes from Generic SA.  For example, OSPFv2 SA needs
   to get such attributes as Auth_len, KeyStartAccept, KeyStartGenerate,
   KeyStopGenerate and KeyStopAccept from GSA.

Abstract 

   This document describes two improvements to unicast based rapid 
   acquisition of multicast RTP sessions (RAMS) described in [I-
   D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp].  One improved method allows 
   a receiver to simultaneously request a unicast burst stream and 
   join the multicast group, and then select one of the two streams to 
   be first processed. Another method proposes to optionally convey a 
   parameter called unicast backspace in the RAMS-I message. This 
   parameter can be used by RR to determine when to join the primary 
   multicast session.

Internet-Draft              Improved RAMS                October 2009 
    

    
    

1. Introduction 

   The basic idea of unicast based rapid acquisition of multicast RTP 
   sessions (RAMS) in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] is as 
   follows.  Instead of joining the multicast group, the receiver 
   first requests a unicast stream, which is transmitted at a rate 
   faster than the multicast stream rate.  The unicast stream starts 
   from a random access point, which contains the so-called Reference 
   Information (RI) or the start of the RI, and thus can be processed 
   without waiting for the next random access point, and consequently 
   the delay for acquisition of the multicast stream is reduced.  This 
   method is effective in reducing channel switching and tune-in delay 
   in multicast applications, such as IPTV. 

   Another important benefit of RAMS is that significantly improved 
   coding efficiency for video streams is possible.  In conventional 
   multicast applications, video streams must be encoded with frequent 
   random access points, e.g. per 0.5 to 1 second, to allow new 
   receivers to tune-in or existing users to switch from another 
   multicast session.  Random access points typically contain intra-
   coded pictures, for which the compression efficiency is 
   significantly, e.g., several to ten times, lower than inter-coded 
   pictures.  Therefore, the less the random access points, the higher 
   the coding efficiency.  When RAMS is in use, random access period 
   length no longer affects the tune-in or channel switching delay.  
   This means that the video random access point frequency can be 
   significantly reduced, which means significantly improved 
   compression efficiency. 

1.1. Improvement - RR simultaneously request a unicast burst stream 
   and join the multicast group 

   Nevertheless, RAMS has the following constraints: 

   o At some point, if the receiver directly joins the multicast 
      group, the received multicast stream may start exactly at a 
      random access point or at a point that is very close to the next 
      random access point.  In this case, the use of the RAMS method 
      actually increases the acquisition delay.  Unfortunately, the 
      receiver has no means to know how far the next random access 
      point in the multicast stream is before it joins the multicast 
      group, otherwise it could choose to either use RAMS or directly 
      join the multicast group, whichever is better.

   o The request for the unicast burst stream may be lost.  Even if 
      the request is retransmitted and finally received, the 
      acquisition delay gets increased. 

   Part or all of the RI may be lost.  Again, the lost information 
   could be retransmitted, which increases the acquisition delay.  If 
   the RI or part of it gets finally lost in any case, the received 
   data in the unicast burst stream cannot be processed until the next 
   random access point.  In this case, the acquisition delay would 
   also be lower if the receiver had chosen to directly join the 
   multicast group without trying to request the unicast burst stream.  
   Unfortunately, there is no way for the receiver to know what loss 
   could happen before the occurrence of the loss.To solve the above 
   problems, this document proposes an improved RAMS method, wherein 
   the receiver simultaneously requests the unicast burst stream and 
   joins the multicast group.  When both the unicast burst stream and 
   the multicast stream are transmitted to the receiver, the downlink 
   bandwidth needed is at least twice as high as the media rate 
   (including the overhead due to network protocol headers).  
   Different than the original RAMS method in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-
   acquisition-for-rtp], herein the unicast burst stream does not need 
   to be transmitted at a rate higher than the media rate, though a 
   higher rate can still be used if possible. 

   The proposed scheme is rationalized based on the following 
   observations.

Internet-Draft              Improved RAMS                October 2009 
    

   o A user who has a certain network accessing bandwidth can 
      typically upgrade the access bandwidth without upgrade of the 
      network accessing equipment.  This means that the network access 
      equipment can typically support higher bandwidth.  On the other 
      hand it may not be a major issue for the network provider to 
      send data to the user at a bandwidth higher than the single 
      stream to the user, unless there is limitation on the data sent 
      by the network provider.  In the context of unicast based rapid 
      acquisition of multicast streams, as the data of the unicast 
      burst stream is just a copy of the multicast stream, there is no 
      additional cost for the data itself (as content) if both streams 
      are obtained.  Therefore, it is feasible both technically and 
      economically (maybe at some added cost) for the user to 
      simultaneously receive the unicast burst stream and the 
      multicast stream.  In particular, as the acquisition process 
      involving receiving both streams is short, in the magnitude of a 
      few seconds, it is likely that network providers, which in many 
      cases are also content providers and services providers, are 
      willing to allow the momentary use of higher bandwidth than 
      usual, either freely to users (i.e. users still pay for the 
      usual bandwidth) or under a new contract that explicitly covers 
      such momentary uses of higher bandwidth.  Their reasoning will 
      be to supply better user experience when they compete with other 
      delivery technologies. 

   o In a digital home with multiple TVs and possibly other connected 
      equipments such as PCs, more than one TV program on different 
      TVs may be watched simultaneously in addition to other network 
      uses under one network accessing contact.  In such a common 
      scenario, the bandwidth available can easily be as at least 
      twice high as the media rate. 

   Note that there will still be cases wherein available bandwidth is 
   not enough for transmission of both the unicast burst stream and 
   the multicast stream simultaneously.  Therefore, it should still be 
   allowed for receivers to switch between the proposed improved 
   method, the original RAMS method, and the conventional method (i.e. 
   directly joining the multicast group). 

1.2. Improvement - RR determines the primary multicast session join 
   time using parameter called Unicast Backspace 

   Per [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp], RS may change the 
   unicast burst rate during the acquisition process, decided by 
   itself or based on some feedback information from RR.  RS may 
   therefore recalculate the earliest multicast join time and send the

Internet-Draft              Improved RAMS                October 2009 
    

   revised values to RR using additional RAMS-I messages.  If such an 
   RAMS-I message gets lost, RR would fail to update its multicast 
   join time accordingly and therefore join the multicast session at 
   an inappropriate time.  This increases the chance and amount of 
   overlap or gap between the unicast burst and primary multicast 
   stream. 

   To increase the accuracy of multicast join time deduction during 
   the fast acquisition, this document proposes to convey a field 
   called unicast backspace in the first RAMS-I message which is as a 
   response to the acceptance of the first RAMS-R message.  Unicast 
   backspace is the RTP time stamp difference between the first 
   unicast burst packet to be sent and the latest primary multicast 
   packet in the buffer of RS.  The RTP timestamps values for these 
   packets are taken from the primary multicast stream.  The value of 
   unicast backspace indicates the amount of data that would be 
   additional transmitted to RR compared to when the RAMS process is 
   not in use.  This value also indicates the additional end-to-end 
   delay introduced by the RAMS process. 

   Unicast backspace is a constant during a fast acquisition process 
   once the start point of the unicast burst is decided by RS.  This 
   value, in conjunction with some parameters that are known to RR, 
   e.g. burst rate, playback rate, amount of buffered data, and 
   initial playback delay, can be used by RR to heuristically 
   determine when to launch multicast join process by sending an SFGMP 
   join message.  RR therefore may not count on RAMS-I to notify the 
   SFGMP join time update due to burst rate change during the rapid 
   acquisition and therefore may alleviate the RS implementation 
   complexity for re-deducing multicast join time. And this way, the 
   amount of protocol signaling interaction between RS and RR may be 
   reduced. Furthermore, when unicast backspace value is known, RR may 
   remove or reduce the additional end-to-end delay introduced by the 
   RAMS process by appropriately controlling the playback process, 
   such that the playback can be synchronized with other users of the 
   same primary multicast session. 

   Note that how RR uses this field to deduce when RR launch the 
   multicast join process is out of scope of this document.

3. Improved Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions 

3.1. RR simultaneously request a unicast burst stream and join the 
   multicast group 

   The improved RAMS method is described by the following steps 
   (referring to Figure 1, based on the same terminology in [I-D.ietf-
   avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp]): 

   1) Request: RR sends an RAMS-R message to the RS to request for the 
      unicast burst session of the new multicast RTP session, and an 
      SFGMP (i.e. IGMP or MLD) Join message to the Router to join the 
      new multicast session.  Preferably, the RAMS-R and SFGMP Join 
      messages are sent simultaneously.  However, the RAMS-R and SFGMP 
      Join messages can also be sent at different temporal locations 
      but should be reasonably close to each other, and there is no 
      restriction to the temporal order of sending the two messages. 

   2) Response: RS receives the RAMS-R message and decides whether to 
      accept it or not.  RS sends one or more RAMS-Information (RAMS-I) 
      messages to the receiver.  If the request is accepted by RS, it 
      starts sending the unicast burst stream.  The unicast burst can 
      be sent to receiver either after or together with RAMS-I message.  
      At the same time or at a slightly different time, the multicast 
      stream starts to flow to RR from the Multicast Source. 

   3) Updated Request or Updated Response: RR MAY send updated RAMS-R 
      messages to RS.  RS MAY send updated RAMS-I messages to RR.

   4) Process: For the received unicast stream and the received 
      multicast stream, the one that can be processed first is chosen.  
      A stream can only be processed from a correctly received random 
      access point.  If both the received unicast stream and the 
      received multicast stream contain correctly received random 
      access points, then either can be chosen.  If the multicast 
      stream is chosen, then the unicast stream is terminated 
      immediately.  In this case, all received packets of the 
      multicast stream are processed (depacketized and decoded).   
      Otherwise (i.e. the unicast stream is chosen), the unicast 
      stream is terminated when it catches the beginning of the 
      received multicast stream, i.e. after the packet in the unicast 
      stream having OSN equal to SNm-1 is received, where OSN stands 
      for Original Sequence Number as defined in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-
      acquisition-for-rtp], SNm is the Sequence Number (SN) of the 
      first packet in the received multicast stream.  In this case, 
      all received packets of the unicast stream having OSN equal to 
      or greater than SNm are discarded, and other received packets of 
      the unicast stream and all received packets of the multicast 
      stream are processed. 

   5) Terminate: In the above step, the unicast stream is terminated 
      by sending an RAMS-T message to RS.  To terminate the unicast 
      stream immediately, RR sends an RAMS-T message without an RTP 
      sequence number.  To instruct RS to terminate the unicast stream 
      after catching the multicast stream, RR SHALL include in the 
      RAMS-T message the sequence number of the first received RTP 
      packet in the received multicast stream.  When RR is receiving 
      the unicast stream, and if RR becomes no longer interested in 
      the multicast stream, RR sends a RTCP BYE message to RS to 
      terminate the RTP retransmission session (which contains both 
      the unicast burst stream as well as the retransmission stream 
      for lost packets). 

3.2. RR determines the primary multicast session join time using 
   parameter called Unicast Backspace 

3.2.1. Unicast Backspace Field 

   Unicast backspace (32 bits): Optional TLV element.  This field 
   gives the RTP timestamp difference between the first unicast burst 
   packet to be sent and the latest primary multicast packet in the 
   buffer.  The RTP timestamps values for these packets are taken from 
   the primary multicast stream.  The value of unicast backspace 
   indicates the amount of data that would be additional transmitted

Internet-Draft              Improved RAMS                October 2009 
    

   to RR compared to when the RAMS process is not in use.  This value 
   also indicates the additional end-to-end delay introduced by the 
   RAMS process.  This field SHOULD be conveyed in the first RAMS-I 
   message and MAY be conveyed in other RAMS-I messages.  RR MAY use 
   this field to determine when to join the multicast session by 
   sending an SFGMP join message. RR MAY also remove or reduce the 
   additional end-to-end delay due to the use of RAMS, as indicated by 
   the unicast backspace field, by appropriately controlling the

~~~> SFGMP Messages 
...> Unicast RTP Flow 
---> Multicast RTP Flow 
    

   The example is described by the following steps: 

   1. RR sends a RTCP RAMS-R message to RS to request a rapid 
      acquisition process. 

   2. Upon accepting of the RAMS-R message, RS sends an RTCP RAMS-I 
      message with unicast backspace field to RR. 

   3. RS transmit Unicast RTP Burst to RR. 

   4. During the burst, RR uses the value of unicast backspace to 
      determine when to send SFGMP Join message to join the primary 
      multicast group.  For example, RR (periodically) estimates the 
      buffer occupation in terms of media timestamp offset between the 
      first and the last RTP packets in the buffer (called B for 
      example).  If the difference between the unicast backspace value 
      and B is less than or equal to a pre-defined threshold value, RR 
      begins to join the multicast session.  Unicast backspace is a 
      determinate value and is always fixed during the burst.  The 
      amount of data in the buffer is known by RR.  The threshold 
      value can be derived as equal to  

                    ((b_r - p_r) / p_r) * multicast_join_latency  

      Where b_r is the burst rate, p_r is the playback rate, and 
      multicast_join_latency is the delay between RR sending SFGMP 
      join message and RR getting the first primary multicast packet.   

This way, RR would not rely on RAMS-I to revise the earliest multicast 
join time after the burst rate is changed by RS.

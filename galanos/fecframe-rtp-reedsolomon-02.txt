                RTP Payload Format for Reed Solomon FEC
               draft-galanos-fecframe-rtp-reedsolomon-02

Abstract

   This document defines an RTP payload format for the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) that uses Reed-Solomon codes.  The format defined by
   this document enables the protection of source media encapsulated in
   RTP with one or more repair flows and is based on the FEC framework
   and the SDP Elements for FEC Framework.  The Reed-Solomon codes used
   in this document belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable
   (MDS) codes which means they offer optimal protection against random
   and bursty packet losses.

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC          August 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) that is generated by the Reed-Solomon code.

   By nature, interactive Real-time applications are extremely sensitive
   to delay and require very low latency.  As a result, retransmission
   of lost packets and using other closed-loop schemes are not valid
   options while the use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) is an
   effective approach.

   A primary requirement from FEC for real time applications is the
   ability to correctly recover from both random and bursty packet
   losses.  The Reed-Solomon FEC codes used in this document belong to
   the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes that are optimal
   in terms of erasure recovery capability for both situations.

   The format defined by this document enables the protection of media
   source flow with one or more repair flows without adding additional
   information to the source packets.  Such behavior reduces the delay
   presented by any FEC scheme and maintains backwards compatibility
   with non FEC-enabled receivers.

   Number of previous drafts were composed to draw different FEC schemes
   suitable for different applications.  The scheme defined in this
   draft is designed to compensate a burst of packet loss over RTP
   networks with minimum delay, which is needed in interactive IP-based
   applications such as video conferencing.

   The method described in this document is generic to all media types
   and provides the sender with the flexibility of deciding if FEC
   protection is required and if so, how many protecting packets and how
   many source packets to use in a block according to network
   conditions.  Furthermore it allows applying unequal error protection
   that provides different level of protection to different packets.
   For example, it can be combined with Scalable Video Coding to protect
   only the base layer packets of the video flow.  At the receiver, both
   the FEC and original media are received.  If no media packets are
   lost, the FEC packets can be ignored.  In the event of a loss, the
   FEC packets can be combined with other received media to recover all
   or part of the missing media packets.

   The Reed-Solomon codes used in this document have been specified in
   [RFC5510] and are compatible with Luigi Rizzo codec (see [Rizzo97]).
   This document is compliant with the Forward Error Correction (FEC)
   Framework (described in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework]) and SDP
   Elements for FEC Framework (described in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements] [RFC4566]).  This draft completes

   [I-D.roca-fecframe-rs] by defining Reed-Solomon usage for RTP
   transport ([RFC3550]) and specifies the appropriate media types (see
   [RFC4288] [RFC3555]).


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions, Notations and Abbreviations

   This document uses the following definitions and notations.  For
   further definitions that apply to FEC Framework in general, see
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework].

3.1.  Definitions

   This document uses the following terms and definitions.  Some of them
   are FEC scheme specific and are in line with [RFC5052]:

   Source symbol:  unit of data used during the encoding process.

   Encoding symbol:  unit of data generated by the encoding process.
      With systematic codes, source symbols are part of the encoding
      symbols.

   Repair symbol:  encoding symbol that is not a source symbol.

   Code rate:  the k/n ratio, i.e., the ratio between the number of
      source symbols and the number of encoding symbols.  By definition,
      the code rate is such that:  0 < code rate <= 1.  A code rate
      close to 1 indicates that a small number of repair symbols have
      been produced during the encoding process.

   Systematic code:  FEC code in which the source symbols are part of
      the encoding symbols.  The Reed-Solomon codes introduced in this
      document are systematic.

   Source block:  a block of k source symbols that are considered
      together for the encoding.

   Packet Erasure Channel:  a communication path where packets are
      either dropped (e.g., by a congested router, or because the number
      of transmission errors exceeds the correction capabilities of the
      physical layer codes) or received.  When a packet is received, it

      is assumed that this packet is not corrupted.

   Some of them are FECFRAME framework specific and are in line with
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework]:

   Application Data Unit (ADU):  a unit of data coming from (sender) or
      given to (receiver) the media delivery application.  In this
      document, an ADU MUST use an RTP encapsulation.

   (Source) ADU Flow:  a flow of ADUs from a media delivery application
      and to which FEC protection is applied.  In this document, there
      MUST be a single ADU flow per FECFRAME framework instance.

   ADU Block:  a set of ADUs that are considered together by the
      FECFRAME instance for the purpose of the FEC scheme.

   FEC Framework Configuration Information:  the FEC scheme specific
      information that enables the synchronization of the FECFRAME
      sender and receiver instances.

   FEC Source Packet:  an RTP data packet submitted to (sender) or
      received from (receiver) the transport protocol.  In this
      document, FEC Source Packets and ADU MUST be the same (e.g., for
      backward compability purposes).

   FEC Repair Packet:  an RTP repair packet submitted to (sender) or
      received from (receiver) the transport protocol.  It contains a
      repair symbol along with its Explicit Repair FEC Payload ID.

3.2.  Notations

   This document uses the following notations:  Some of them are FEC
   scheme specific:

   k      denotes the number of source symbols in a source block.

   max_k  denotes the maximum number of source symbols for any source
          block.

   n_r    denotes the number of repair symbols generated for a source
          block.

   n      denotes the number of encoding symbols generated for a source
          block.  Therefore:  n = k + n_r.

   max_n  denotes the maximum number of encoding symbols generated for
          any source block.

   S      denotes the encoding symbol length in units of m-bit elements.
          When m = 8, then S and E are equal.

   GF(q)  denotes a finite field (also known as Galois Field) with q
          elements.  We assume that q = 2^^m in this document.

   m      defines the length of the elements in the finite field, in
          bits.  In this document, m belongs to {2..16}.

   q      defines the number of elements in the finite field.  We have:
          q = 2^^m in this specification.

   CR     denotes the "code rate", i.e., the k/n ratio.

   a^^b   denotes a raised to the power b.

3.3.  Abbreviations

   This document uses the following abbreviations:

   ADU    stands for Application Data Unit.

   ESI    stands for Encoding Symbol ID.

   FEC    stands for Forward Error Correction code.

   FFCI   stands for FEC Framework Configuration Information.

   RS     stands for Reed-Solomon.

   MDS    stands for Maximum Distance Separable code.


4.  Reed Solomon Codes

   The detailed operation and theory behind Reed Solomon codes is out of
   the scope of this document.  In general a Reed Solomon code takes a
   group of k source symbols and generates n - k repair symbols.  A
   receiver needs to receive any k of the n source or repair symbols in
   order to recover the remaining n-k symbols.  As explained in RFC
   5510, the Reed-Solomon algorithm operates over multiple elements each
   taken from a single source symbol.  Symbols are composed of S "m-bit
   elements" where m is the Galois Field exponent GF(2^m).  In the usual
   case of GF(2^8), elements are bytes, and the size S in terms of
   elements is of course equal to the symbol size in bytes.  The symbol

   size can be different in different implementations.  Any symbol size
   can be used in the format offered by this document.  However, it is
   recommended in terms of implementation simplicity to use 8-bits
   elements.  For more information on Reed Solomon codes, the reader is
   referred to [Rizzo97].


5.  Source Block Creation

   This draft defines the protection of an RTP source flow using one or
   more FEC repair flows.

   A source block for the Reed-Solomon code contains k source symbols.
   In the scheme presented by this document, each source symbol contains
   a single Application Data Unit (ADU, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework]), which is in our case an RTP packet.
   Therefore a source block contains exactly k RTP packets.  The Reed-
   Solomon code generates n_r = n - k repair symbols that are
   transmitted using n_r = n - k FEC repair packets.  Each FEC repair
   packet contains a single repair block.

   To create a source block the steps outlined below should be followed:

   1.  Determine the largest RTP packet size (in bytes) of the source
       block.  During this computation, both the RTP header and payload
       are considered

   2.  For each ADU of this source block, create a byte array (of size 2
       + this largest RTP packet size), as follows:

       A.  In the first two bytes, place the unsigned network-ordered
           16-bit representation of the RTP packet size in bytes
           (including RTP header size and payload size)

       B.  Append the entire RTP packet including its RTP header

       C.  Add zero padding so that the byte array is the size of the
           largest packet protected by this source block plus two (to
           consider the initial two bytes).  Therefore, the largest
           packet does not contain padding.

   3.  Append all the byte arrays one after the other in the following
       way:

       A.  The packets are in an increasing order of the sequence number
           as it appears in the RTP packet header taking wraparound into
           account

   Figure 1 demonstrates how a source block is created from 4 packets
   (P1, P2, P3, P4) with different sizes.  The largest packet protected
   in this source block has a size of 5 (L = 5) and therefore P1 and P3
   are both padded with zeros to this size.  The source block contains
   the RTP packet size before each packet.  (Note that this example is
   not a binary representation of the source block.  The Packet size
   spans over two bytes as stated above)


            P1          P2            P3            P4
            L=3         L=5           L=4           L=5

            +---+       +-----+       +----+      +-----+
            |xxx|       |xxxxx|       |xxxx|      |xxxxx|
            +---+       +-----+       +----+      +-----+

                     |--- Source Block (k=4) ----|

                     +------+------+------+------+
                     |3xxx00|5xxxxx|4xxxx0|5xxxxx|
                     +------+------+------+------+

                   Figure 1: Structure of a Source Block

   The FEC Reed-Solomon Scheme gets a source block created from k
   packets and generates n-k FEC repair packets that protect the entire
   source block.  These packets are then transmitted in the repair flow.
   Note that source packets padding is done only for FEC packet
   calculation and the original payloads are transmitted without extra
   padding.


6.  Packet Formats

   This section defines the formats of the source and repair packets

6.1.  FEC Source Packets

   The FEC Framework requires that FEC source packets contain
   information identifying the source block and the position within the
   source block occupied by the packet.  However, in order to maintain
   backwards compatibility, the scheme defined by this document enables
   the receiver to get this information without appending additional
   information to the source packet.  Specifically this information is
   obtained using the combination of sequence number found in the RTP
   header and information provided in the FEC header of each FEC repair
   packet.  Such behavior enables both non-FEC-capable and FEC-capable
   receivers to receive and interpret the same source packets sent in a

   multicast session.

6.2.  FEC Repair Packets

   The FEC repair packets contain information that enables the receiver
   to reconstruct the source block in the remote end.  This is done by
   using the RTP header of the FEC repair packets as well as another
   dedicated header that is placed within the RTP payload.  This header,
   referred to as the FEC header, complies with
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] (section 6.4.1), as shown in Figure 2.

                +------------------------------+ ---

                    Figure 2: Format of repair packets

6.2.1.  RTP header format

   The RTP header is formatted according to [RFC3550] with some further
   clarifications listed below:

   o  Marker (M) Bit:  This bit is not used for this payload type, and
      is set to 0.

   o  Payload Type:  The (dynamic) payload type for the repair packets
      is determined through out-of-band means.  Note that this document
      registers new payload formats for the repair packets (Refer to
      Section 5 for details).  According to [RFC3550], an RTP receiver
      that cannot recognize a payload type must discard it.  This
      provides for backward compatibility.  The FEC mechanisms can then
      be used in a multicast group with mixed FEC-capable and non-FEC-
      capable receivers.  If a non-FEC-capable receiver receives a
      repair packet, it will not recognize the payload type, and hence,
      will discard the repair packet.  In case more than one repair flow
      is used, different Payload Types will be used to distinguish
      between the different flows.

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC          August 2010


   o  Sequence Number (SN):  The sequence number maintains the standard
      definition.  It is one higher than the sequence number in the
      previously transmitted repair packet.  The initial value of the
      sequence number is random (unpredictable) [RFC3550].

   o  Timestamp (TS):  The timestamp is set to a time corresponding to
      the repair packet's transmission time.  Note that the timestamp
      value has no use in the actual FEC protection process and is
      usually useful for jitter calculations.  FEC packets that are the
      result of the same FEC encoding operation will use the same value
      as their Timestamp.

   o  Synchronization Source (SSRC):  The SSRC value is randomly
      assigned as suggested by [RFC3550].

6.2.2.  FEC header format

   The FEC header includes information that enables the receiver to
   reconstruct the source block and to identify the FEC repair packets
   associated with each source block, in their correct order.

   The format of the FEC header is shown in figure 3.

                        Figure 3: FEC Header Format

   The FEC header consists of the following general fields:

   o  n_r (8-bit field):  the number of FEC repair packets used to
      protect this source block.

   o  i (8-bit field):  the 0-based index in the sequence of n_r FEC
      repair packets.  This index is equal to ESI - k, where ESI is the
      Encoding Symbol ID of the associated repair symbol.

   o  SN_base (16-bit field):  the lowest RTP sequence number (taking
      wraparound into account) of the FEC source packets in the

      associated source block.  This SN_base also identifies the source
      block.  In order to avoid any risk of confusion, two consecutive
      source blocks MUST use different SN_base values, which is easily
      verified by the sender (this situation might happen with Reed-
      Solomon over GF(2^16)).

   o  pkt_span (16-bit field):  the number of consecutive FEC Source
      Packets considered.  A subset of these FEC Source Packets may be
      missing, as indicated by the 0 entries of the optional bit-mask.

   o  Reserved (12-bit field):  reserved for future use.  This field
      MUST be set to zero in this specification.

   o  Bit Mask Length, BML (4-bit field):  when the pkt_span source
      packets of the source block don't have consecutive RTP sequence
      numbers, a bit-mask MUST be used to indicate which packets are
      protected by this FEC packet.  This field indicates the length of
      the bit-mask in units of 32-bit words, as the following table
      shows.  In any case, only the first pkt_span bits of this bit-
      field are meaningful, the remaining bits (if any) MUST be set to
      0.

   o  bit-mask (Optional field, length multiple of 32 bits):  When BML
      is set to a value different than 0000, a bit-mask field is added,
      whose length in term of number of 32-bit words is indicated by the
      BML field.  The bit-mask indicates which source packets have been
      considered in the source block ("1" bit valude entry in the bit-
      field) and which source packets have been ignored ("0" bit valude
      entry in the bit-field) (usually this happens when a source packet
      has been erased (lost) before reaching the FECFRAME encoder).  The
      first packet in the bit-mask (corresponding to bit position 0 of
      the first 32-bit word) corresponds to the source packet whose RTP
      sequence number is specified in field SN_base.

6.2.3.  Repair Data Format

   The repair data follows the FEC header in the FEC repair packet.  It
   includes the result of the Reed-Solomon encoding over the source
   block.  Note that the first two bytes of the repair data contain the
   result of the Reed-Solomon encoding over the packet sizes in the
   source block and that the size of the repair data equals the size of
   the largest packet protected by this source block plus 2.  Therefore,
   the size of an FEC repair packet (FEC header and data) is larger than
   the longest source packet.  This should be taken under consideration
   when deciding on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size used for
   the source packets.


7.  Payload Format Parameters

   According to the FEC framework, when RTP is used as a transport for
   repair packet flows, the scheme must define an RTP Payload Format for
   the repair data.  This section provides the media subtype
   registration for the Reed-Solomon FEC.  The parameters that are
   required to configure the FEC encoding and decoding operations are
   also defined in this section.

7.1.  Media Type Registration

   This registration is done using the template defined in [RFC4288] and

7.2.  Mapping of SDP Parameters

   For a proper operation details of the FEC scheme have to be
   communicated between the sender and the receiver.  Specifically, the
   receiver has to know the relationship between the source and the
   repair flows, how the sender applied protection to the source flow
   and how the repair flows can be used to recover the lost data.  One
   way to provide this information is to use the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].

   The mapping of the media type specification for "reed-solomon-fec"
   and their parameters in SDP is as follows:

   o  The media type (e.g., "application") goes into the "m=" line as
      the media name.

   o  The media subtype ("reed-solomon-fec") goes into the "a=rtpmap"
      line as the encoding name.

   o  The remaining required payload-format-specific parameters
      ("max_n", "repair-window") go into the "a=fmtp" line by copying
      them directly from the media type string as a semicolon-separated
      list of parameter=value pairs.

   See section 9 for SDP examples.


8.  Protection and Recovery Procedures

   This section provides a complete specification of the protection and
   recovery procedures.

8.1.  Overview

   The FEC repair packets allow end-systems to recover from a loss of
   media packets.  The following sections specify the steps involved in
   generating the FEC repair packets and reconstructing the missing
   source packets from the FEC repair packets.

8.2.  FEC Repair Packet Construction

   The RTP header of a FEC repair packet is formed based on the
   guidelines given in Section 6.2.1.  The FEC header is formed based on
   the guidelines given in Figure 3.  Before Reed-Solomon encoding, two
   bytes are prepended to each ADU (RTP source packet in our case) that
   contain this ADU length in bytes, stored in network-order.  FEC



Galanos, et al.           Expires March 4, 2011                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC          August 2010


   encoding can then take place and the n_r = n - k repair symbols are
   created.  Each repair symbol is then appended to its FEC header.

8.3.  Source Packet Reconstruction

   Recovery requires two distinct operations.  The first operation
   determines which packets (source and repair) must be considered in
   order to recover the missing packets of a given block.  Once this is
   done, the second step is the reconstruction of the missing data.

8.3.1.  Associating the Source and Repair Packets

   Association of the FEC source packets and FEC repair packets is done
   using a combination of the source packet sequence number and the
   information found in the RTP header and the FEC header of the FEC
   repair packets.  The first step is to accumulate some of the n_r = n
   - k repair packets that were generated in the protection operation.
   For that the application has to follow the steps listed below:

   o  For each received packet, retrieve the payload type parameter from
      the RTP header to identify the packet as a repair packet of the
      reed-solomon scheme.  In case multiple repair flows are used,
      different payload types will be used to distinguish between the
      different repair flows.

   o  If a FEC repair packet is received, retrieve the sequence number
      (SN) from the RTP header and the n_r and i parameters from the FEC
      header.  With these parameters, identify the collection of FEC
      repair packets generated for the source block.  For example, if
      n_r = 4, i = 2 and SN = 1003, the receiver deduces that 4 FEC
      repair packets with sequence numbers 1001, 1002, 1003 and 1004
      have been generated for this source block.

   o  Still in case of a FEC repair packet, retrieve the BML, pkt_span
      and optional bit-mask fields.  If BML equals 0, then k = pkt_span
      and the source packets have sequence numbers SN_base up to SN_base
      + k.  If BML is greater than 0, the first pkt_span bits of the
      bit-mask must be analyzed. k is then equal to the number of bits
      equal to 1 in this bit-mask.  The sequence numbers of the source
      packets that are acutally part of the source block are equal to
      SN_base plus the offset of the bits equal to 1 in this bit-mask.

8.3.2.  Recovering the source packet

   In order to recover the lost source packets, the application has to
   rebuild the source block according to the guidelines given in
   Section 5 and append the repair data to it in the correct order.
   Zero padding will replace the lost packets in the constructed source



Galanos, et al.           Expires March 4, 2011                [Page 20]

   block.  The size of each source block data packet in bytes will be
   equal to the size of the repair data found in the repair packets.
   The repair data size is the size of the RTP payload in the repair
   packet without the FEC header information (see figure 2).  The
   application will then append the repair data taken from each repair
   packet.  This new block is provided to the Reed-Solomon code.

   Reconstruction of lost packets (source or repair packets) is possible
   only if at least any k packets were received (source or repair).

   The Reed-Solomon code will reconstruct the lost data into the
   provided source block overriding the zero padded blocks.  The
   application can then recover the lost packets as follows:

   o  The first two bytes specify the RTP packet size.

   o  According to the RTP packet size the application can retrieve the
      RTP packet (RTP header and payload).

   o  Any extra padding bytes if exist are ignored.

10.  Implementation Considerations

   Using Reed-Solomon FEC protection over RTP may be useful for
   efficiently overcoming newtork packet losses in interactive
   communications where latency constraints apply.  Protection may be
   applied for small encoding blocks, and therefore latency caused by
   waiting for the FEC repair packets is minimized.

   This document allows the application to set the FEC strength
   dynamically according to the experienced and measured loss rate, for
   optimizing bandwidth utilization while recovering from network
   errors.

   When FEC protection is used due to network congestion conditions, it
   is important that the application will reduce the bandwidth used for
   FEC protection from the bandwidth used by the source flow, in order
   not to overload the already congested network with the additional FEC
   repair packets.

   In order to minimize bandwidth overhead for repair packets, algorithm
   for applying FEC on source packets should be designed carefully.
   Using source packets with similar lengths (when possible) can
   minimize the bandwidth overhead of the FEC repair packets.

   In order to maximize the FEC strength, when a ratio of k/n is chosen,
   the larger the source blocks size (n) is, the stronger the FEC
   protection is.  Of course, on the other hand the larger the source
   block size is, the larger the latency is (caused by waiting for the
   FEC repair packet).  The application should choose carefuly the FEC
   block size in order to maximize the FEC strength while keeping an
   acceptable latency at the receiver waiting for the FEC repair
   packets.

12.  Security Considerations

12.1.  Problem Statement

   A content delivery system is potentially subject to many attacks.
   Some of them target the network (e.g., to compromise the routing
   infrastructure, by compromising the congestion control component),
   others target the Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) (e.g., to
   compromise its normal behavior), and finally some attacks target the

   content itself.  Since this document focuses on various FEC schemes,
   this section only discusses the additional threats that their use
   within the FECFRAME framework can create to an arbitrary CDP.

   More specifically, these attacks may have several goals:

   o  those that are meant to give access to a confidential content
      (e.g., in case of a non-free content),

   o  those that try to corrupt the ADU Flows being transmitted (e.g.,
      to prevent a receiver from using it),

   o  and those that try to compromise the receiver's behavior (e.g., by
      making the decoding of an object computationally expensive).

   These attacks can be launched either against the data flow itself
   (e.g., by sending forged FEC Source/Repair Packets) or against the
   FEC parameters that are sent either in-band (e.g., in the Repair FEC
   Payload ID) or out-of-band (e.g., in a session description).

12.2.  Attacks Against the Data Flow

   First of all, let us consider the attacks against the data flow.

12.2.1.  Access to Confidential Contents

   Access control to the ADU Flow being transmitted is typically
   provided by means of encryption.  This encryption can be done within
   the content provider itself, by the application (for instance by
   using the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711]), or
   at the Network Layer, on a packet per packet basis when IPSec/ESP is
   used [RFC4303].  If confidentiality is a concern, it is RECOMMENDED
   that one of these solutions be used.  Even if we mention these
   attacks here, they are not related nor facilitated by the use of FEC.

12.2.2.  Content Corruption

   Protection against corruptions (e.g., after sending forged FEC
   Source/Repair Packets) is achieved by means of a content integrity
   verification/sender authentication scheme.  This service is usually
   provided at the packet level.  In this case, after removing all
   forged packets, the ADU Flow may be sometimes recovered.  Several
   techniques can provide this source authentication/content integrity
   service:

   o  at the application level, the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
      (SRTP) [RFC3711] provides several solutions to authenticate the
      source and check the integrity of RTP and RTCP messages, among



Galanos, et al.           Expires March 4, 2011                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC          August 2010


      other services.  For instance, associated to the Timed Efficient
      Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) [RFC4383], SRTP is an
      attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides a true
      authentication/integrity service, and does not create any
      prohibitive processing load or transmission overhead.  Yet,
      checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more) after
      its reception with TESLA.  Other building blocks can be used
      within SRTP to provide authentication/content integrity services.

   o  at the Network Layer, IPSec/ESP offers (among other services) an
      integrity verification mechanism that can be used to provide
      authentication/content integrity services.

   Techniques relying on public key cryptography (e.g., digital
   signatures) require that public keys be securely associated to the
   entities.  This can be achieved by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI),
   or by a PGP Web of Trust, or by pre-distributing the public keys of
   each group member.

   Techniques relying on symmetric key cryptography require that a
   secret key be shared by all group members.  This can be achieved by
   means of a group key management protocol, or simply by pre-
   distributing the secret key (but this manual solution has many
   limitations).

   It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security
   requirements and features of the target application area, to define
   which solution is the most appropriate.  Nonetheless it is
   RECOMMENDED that at least one of these techniques be used.

12.3.  Attacks Against the FEC Parameters

   Let us now consider attacks against the FEC parameters included in
   the FFCI that are usually sent out-of-band (e.g., in a session
   description).  Attacks on these FEC parameters can prevent the
   decoding of the associated object.  For instance modifying the m
   field (when applicable) will lead a receiver to consider a different
   code.  Modifying the E parameter will lead a receiver to consider bad
   Repair Symbols for a received FEC Repair Packet.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to
   guarantee the FFCI integrity.  When the FFCI is sent out-of-band in a
   session description, this latter SHOULD be protected, for instance by
   digitally signing it.

   Attacks are also possible against some FEC parameters included in the
   Explicit Repair FEC Payload ID.  For instance modifying the SN_base
   of a FEC Repair Packet will lead a receiver to assign this packet to

   a wrong block.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to
   guarantee the Explicit Repair FEC Payload ID integrity.  To that
   purpose, one of the packet-level source authentication/content
   integrity techniques of Section 12.2.2 can be used.


13.  IANA Considerations

   New media subtypes are subject to IANA registration.  For the
   registration of the payload formats and their parameters introduced
   in this document, refer to Section 7.

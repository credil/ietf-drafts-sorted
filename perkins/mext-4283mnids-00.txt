1.  Introduction

   The Mobile Node Identifier Option for MIPv6 [2] has proved to be a
   popular design tool for providing identifiers for mobile nodes during
   authentication procedures with AAA protocols such as Diameter [4].
   To date, only a single type of identifier has been specified, namely
   the MN NAI.  Other types of identifiers are in common use, and even
   referenced in RFC 4283 itself.  In this document, we propose adding
   some basic types that are commonly in use in various
   telecommunications standards, including the IMSI, P-TMSI, IMEI, GUTI,
   and IEEE MAC-layer addresses.  In addition, we include the IPv6
   address itself as a legitimate mobile node identifier.

2.  New Mobile Node Identifier Types

   The following types of identifiers are commonly used to identify
   mobile nodes.  For each type, references are provided with full
   details on the format of the type of identifer.

   o  IPv6 Address [1]

   o  IMSI [5]

   o  P-TMSI [5]

   o  EUI-48 address [6]

   o  EUI-64 address [6]

   o  GUTI [5]

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms, and does
   not have any impact on existing security mechanisms.  Insofar as the
   selection of a security association may be dependent on the exact
   form of a mobile node identifier, additional specification may be
   necessary when the new identifier types are employed with the general
   AAA mechanisms for mobile node authorizations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The new mobile node identifier types defined in the document should
   be assigned values from the "Mobile Node Identifier Option Subtypes"
   registry.  The following values should be assigned.

                     New Mobile Node Identifier Types

               +-----------------+------------------------+
               | Identifier Type | Identifier Type Number |
               +-----------------+------------------------+
               | IPv6 Address    | 2                      |
               |                 |                        |
               | IMSI            | 3                      |
               |                 |                        |
               | P-TMSI          | 4                      |
               |                 |                        |
               | EUI-48 address  | 5                      |
               |                 |                        |
               | EUI-64 address  | 6                      |
               |                 |                        |
               | GUTI            | 7                      |
               +-----------------+------------------------+

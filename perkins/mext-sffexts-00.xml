<t>
	A mobile node with multiple radio interfaces running in
	single-radio mode will typically need IP address continuity
	as it migrates from one 4G wireless network to another; Mobile
	IPv6 is very well suited for that purpose.  For such mobile nodes
	using Mobile IP, mobility management by the home agent can be
	extended to provide necessary information about the Signal
	Forwarding Functions (SFFs) that have been defined for WiMAX and
	for eHSPA/CDMA networks.  In this document, we explain the
	operations required to support single-radio mobile nodes and
	specify new extensions to Mobile IPv6 Binding Update and
	Binding Acknowledgement for supporting ease of access between
	mobile nodes and SFFs.

<t>

There is growing interest to enable efficient handovers between
heterogeneous radio access technologies (RATs) for networks owned
by the same network operator, or network operators who have entered
into roaming agreements.  Since authentication is indispensible
for enabling the attachment of a mobile node, a mutually accessible
authentication authority is indispensible for enabling efficient
handovers between such operator networks.  Based on this authentication
authority, we can develop trust relationships between agents in each
network that are charged with responsibilities for aiding handovers.
</t>

<t>

Wireless devices that are designed to attach to networks using
heterogeneous RATs must include radio interfaces enabling connectivity
to each desired RAT.  But each radio interface requires substantial
power -- in fact, the radio interfaces for mobile wireless devices
are quite often the biggest consumer of scarce battery power.  For
this reason, today, and into the foreseeable future, most mobile
wireless devices that have multiple radio interfaces will nevertheless
only keep one of them powered on at any particular time.  Such devices
are known as "single-radio" mobile nodes (MNs), notwithstanding the
presence of multiple radio interfaces in each MN's hardware.
</t>

<t>

Single-radio nodes present design challenges, because if only
a single radio interface is powered on at any particular time,
it is not possible for the device to be simultaneously connected
to two different networks.  In such cases, handover protocols must
try to compensate for the time during which the wireless device
will be retuning its hardware to establish a link with the target
network.  This "break-before-make" mode of operation is susceptible
to dropping packets during the time when the target radio access
link is not yet established, but the link to the source network has
already been released.
</t>

<t>

For smooth handovers, it is imperative to reduce the time between
release of one radio link and establishment of the new radio link
at the target network.  Before the new link can be established in
the target network, some or all of the following procedures must
typically be followed:

<list style="hanging">

<t>
- Scheduling the radio link
</t>

<t>
- Authenticating the mobile node
</t>

<t>
- Creating proper context for the mobile node
</t>

<t>
- Allocating data paths for traffic to/from the mobile node
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>

The specific details for each step vary quite a bit depending
on the particular RAT used in the target network.  But, regardless
of the particular target RAT, completing the listed procedures
is too time consuming to enable smooth handovers when faced
with the "break-before-make" nature of a single-radio MN.  For
this reason, it is very important that the MN try to accomplish
as many of the attachment procedures as possible before releasing
its current radio link.  So, for instance, while MN is still
attached to network N1, it may try to transfer context to a target
base station in a target network N2.  In fact, almost all of the
above procedures can be accomplished ahead of the actual radio
link break, with operator agreement and mutual access to core
network functions.   For ease of discussion, in this document
all such handover optimizations will collectively be termed as
"pre-registration".
</t>

<t>

There has been considerable effort invested into protocol support 
for preregistration.  To do the signaling from the current network
into the target network, the mobile node needs the following
information about the target network:
<list style="hanging">

<t>
- Scheduling the radio link
</t>

<t>
- location of basestation or access point
</t>

<t>
- IP addresses of signaling endpoints for preregistration
  functional modules
</t>

<t>
- Security association parameters for those signaling endpoints
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>

The latter requirement results from the possibility that
preregistration signaling between the MN's current network and
the target network may traverse the Internet, even though the
networks are owned by the same operators or operators who
have made roaming agreements.  It may be impracticable for
such information to be preconfigured into each of the millions
of subscriber devices roaming around today's wireless networks,
and the number of devices continues to increase rapidly from
year to year.  Given that, any preconfiguration strategy is
likely to fail soon.
</t>

<t>

Therefore, the MN must not only follow the require preregistration
procedures for the target network, but it must also discover
the necessary IP addresses for the target functional modules, and
it must also establish a security relationship with each such
target module.  The discovery mechanisms for these handover agents
typically involve DHCP or resolution of purpose-built DNS name.
The former approach could be integrated with other DHCP access
procedures; using DNS affords a speed advantage to the latter
approach.  One can reasonably ask how the MN might get access
to the proper DHCP server or DNS server, especially given the
emphasis on private addressing in today's networks.  Many
restrictions and assumptions are required in order for the
necessary information to be supplied to the MN.
</t>

<t>

These discovery and security procedures are to be undertaken
after the MN determines that it would be beneficial to move to
a new network.  The benefit is typically for improved coverage,
but in many cases also results from reduced cost or improved
security or access to needed resources unavailable in the current
network.  For whatever reason, after the determination is made,
the MN cannot yet start to carry out its preregistration tasks.
The discovery and security tasks cannot be started until the
target network can be identified, and the target network is
closely associated with the current location of the MN.
</t>

<t>

In summary, once the MN starts to move to a new network, the
following are required:
<list style="hanging">

<t>
- Discovery of handover agent(s) in the target network
</t>

<t>
- Security establishment with target agents
</t>

<t>
- Pre-authentication using the security services trusted by
  the foreign network
</t>

<t>
- Other pre-registration tasks.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Each of these procedures may require lengthy signaling
transactions with the MN.  It is the goal of this document
to specify a way to reduce the time delay associated with the
first two tasks.  By doing so, it is expected that handover
performance can be substantially improved.  Moreover, given
reasonable assumptions about operator roaming agreements, it
is likely that this proposal will be simpler to deploy and
simpler for ongoing network management.

<section anchor="Overview" title="Overview">
	
<t>	
Recent documents describing handovers between cooperating networks
supporting different radio technologies have specified a new
functional module called a Signal Forwarding Function (SFF).
The SFF is the agent in the target network which assists the
MN to carry out preregistration tasks while the MN still has
radio access in its current network.  The details of the signaling
between the MN and the SFF fundamentally depend on the requirements
of the target network; it is out of scope for this document to
specify any preregistration protocol exchange that the SFF would
handle in the target network on behalf of the MN.  See Figure 1.
</t>

<t>	
SFF behavior has been specified in detail for eHSPA/CDMA networks
as well as for WiMAX networks.  For a variety of reasons, seemingly
not all technical, 3GPP has chosen to recommend instead a more
integrated approach for interworking between LTE networks and other
target networks.  Notably, LTE handovers are specified under the
assumption that the MN's address belongs to the LTE operator.
WiMAX and HSPA network technologies are more friendly to assisting
MN's that are addressable from via domains supporting other
RATs.
</t>

<t>	

Signaling between single-radio MNs and the SFF in a target network
may follow protocol under development in the 802.21(c) task group
under the auspices of IEEE 802.  This document can be viewed as
a companion document to the SFF-based handover assistance being
defined within 802.21(c).
</t>

<t>	

As the MN moves from one network to another, the SFF that was
the target SFF becomes the SFF in the MN's current network.
We observe that for operators offering SFF modules for handovers
between heterogeneous network types, the SFF in the MN's current
network (which can be called the "originating network") can
manage security associations with the SFF's in neighboring
networks belonging to roaming partners.  Such security associations
facilitate a simplified approach for the necessary discovery and
security establishment between a MN and a target SFF, as follows.
</t>

<t>	

When the MN completes its handover to a target network, it will
have a security association with the SFF in that target network.
If the MN maintains this security association, then it can make
use of the SFF in that network to assist in discovery and
secure communication with a future SFF in a future target network.
The abbreviation TSFF will be used for the target SFF, and the
SFF in the MN's current network will be called the "Originating SFF",
abbreviated OSFF.  With that terminology, the handover between
the originating network and the target network can be made faster
using the services of the OSFF and the TSFF.
</t>

<t>	

Specifically, when the MN has determined that a handover
is beneficial, the following services should be offered by the OSFF:
<list style='hanging'>
<t>
- The OSFF should be able to identify the proper TSFF to
  help the MN with handover to the target network.
</t>
<t>
- The OSFF should be able to provide a shared key to establish
  a security association between the MN and the TSFF.
</t>
</list>
In other words, the OSFF enables optimized discovery and
security establishment for the TSFF and thus substantially
simplifies and shortens the handover preparation time
needed by the MN.  When the MN arrives at the target network,
the TSFF becomes the OSFF and the MN has a security
association with the OSFF useful for future handover
services.
</t>

<section anchor="Colocate"
	title="Co-locating SFF in the home network with the Home Agent">
	


<t>
	The foregoing explanation does not explain how a MN might best
	get information about the SFF in the network providing the MN's
	initial point of attachment (PoA).
</t>

<t>
	Up until this point in the current document, there has been no attention
	paid for the need of the MN to maintain IP address continuity as it
	moves from the originating network to a target network.  For this
	purpose, the MN can use Mobile IPv6<xref target="RFC3775" />
	(or Mobile IP for IPv4 devices<xref target="RFC3344" />).  The
	Binding Update (BU) from the MN is, more often than not, transmitted
	as soon as the MN has established a radio link at the target
	network; alternatively, the BU could be sent just as the radio
	link between the MN and the originating network were to be
	broken.  This latter approach as the advantage of reducing
	the amount of time during which the home agent would be routing
	packets to the wrong network, but would not work as well if the
	target network required a long time to establish a new radio
	link.
</t>

<t>
	When the mobile node (MN) is making its initial point of
	attachment, it does not yet need the services of any SFF.  
	The MN could get the required address of the SFF and establish
	a security association at any time after its initial attachment
	procedures have completed.  In this document, it is proposed
	that this information be delivered by the home agent as part
	of the Mobile IPv6 registration procedure.  Furthermore, it is
	proposed that the SFF function in the home domain should be
	co-located with the home agent in that domain.  Doing so has
	several advantages, as follows:

<list style='hanging'>
<t>
- The home agent is a natural repository for mobility management
  functions such as SFF.  If the home agent is co-located with
  the SFF in the MN's home domain, it can readily assist the MN
  with handovers from any visited network back to the home
  network.  This is expected to be a very frequent case.
</t>
<t>

- The MN naturally already has a security association with
  the home agent.  When the home agent is co-located with
  home SFF (i.e., HSFF), then the all of the necessary procedures
  for finding and securing communications with SFFs in all visited
  networks of roaming partners can be accomplished without any
  additional need for DHCP or IKEv2.
</t>
<t>

- The MN is already required to securely transmit a BU to
  its home agent.  Adding a new extension to the BU, requesting
  the IP address and shared key for the local SFF is economical
  and introduces fewer error conditions.
</t>
<t>

- In the typical case where the MN begins its initial network
  attachment in its home network, the MN can rely on its home
  agent as an OSFF for future handovers to target networks.
</t>
<t>
- For handovers from WiFi into any network of roaming partner,
  the MN can utilize its home agent/HSFF as an OSFF to establish
  preregistration signaling with any desired target network
  enabled for roaming.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Given the appropriate security model between roaming partners,
co-locating the SFF function with the home agent in the home
network enables also reduces the number of mobility agents
requiring configuration and management.
</t>

<t>
The following extension to the Binding Update is needed
so that the MN can request information about the SFF in the
network providing its care-of address
<list style='hanging'>
<t>
- SFF address Request (SFF-REQ)
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The following extension to the Binding Acknowledgement is needed
so that the HA can request information about the SFF to the
requesting MN
<list style='hanging'>
<t>
- SFF address Reply (SFF-REP)
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
	The SFF in the MN's current network (i.e., OSFF) will be
	tasked with enabling security associations between the MN
	and a future target SFF.  Therefore the MN will require a
	security association with OSFF, and there does not appear
	to be a need for providing an "SFF address Request" extension
	that does not also imply a simulataneous request for key
	material to establish the security association with OSFF.
</t>

<t>
	The Home Agent MAY supply an SFF-REP extension to the MN in
	its BAck even when the MN has not requested it, if the
	MN is known by preconfiguration or other means to support
	the ability to utilize OSFF for handover assistance.
</t>

<t>
	It is presumed in this initial version of the SFF-REQ and
	SFF-REP specification that the MN's care-of address is
	sufficient for the home agent to determine the proper
	and roaming network to which the OSFF belongs, and thus
	be able to determine the IP address for the OSFF.  Future
	versions of this specification may specify additional
	location information to be included with the Binding Update.
</t>

<section anchor="formats" title="Extension Formats">

	Header, and the SFF-REP may only appear in a Binding Acknowledgement

<t>
	This document uses techniques from RFC 2104 (and RFC 3957) for key

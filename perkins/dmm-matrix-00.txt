Abstract

   Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) is proposed as a way to enable
   scalable growth of mobile core networks so that network service
   providers can meet new requirements for performance and reduced
   operational expenditures.  This requires reconsideration of existing
   approaches within the IETF and elsewhere in order to determine which
   if any such approaches may be used as part of a DMM solution.

Internet-Draft            DMM Comparison Matrix                 Jul 2011


1.  Introduction

   The goal of this document is to identify and compare known existing
   approaches for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM).
   Characterizations of each of the various methods selected for
   comparison are provided in a matrix form according to whether or not
   they meet certain criteria.

   Efforts within the IETF have been launched to find improved mobility
   management by decentralizing some or all of the traditional functions
   associated with mobility, including handovers, location management,
   identification, and so on.

   The following abbreviations appear in this document:

      MN: mobile node

      HA: home agent

      CN: correspondent node

      FQDN: Fully Qualified Domain Name

   The following approaches to mobility management are characterized:

      Route optimization (RO): MN supplies Binding Updates directly to
      CN.[RFC3775]

      Source address selection refinements (SAddrSel): MN picks source
      address appropriate for current point of attachment when launching
      an application.

      Dynamically allocated home agent (DynHA): Mobility anchor for MN
      is allocated on demand.

      Binding updates to CN even without HA (CN-wo-HA): Similar to RO,
      but does not require protocol signaling with home agent.

      Transport protocol (Trans-Mob) : MN modifies transport (e.g., TCP,
      SCTP, DCCP, MPTCP) protocol parameters to change the IP address of
      transport connection endpoint

      Local anchor (Anchor-Mob): Local mobility anchor (e.g., MAP in
      HMIP [RFC5380]) available for use by MN at its current point of
      attachment.

      Dynamic DNS (DynDNS): When MN gets a new address, DNS is updated
      so that the MN's FQDN resolves to that new address.

   The approaches listed above will be characterized according to the
   following criteria:

   1.  scalability: in # of nodes

   2.  specified?: whether there is a working group document specifying
       the approach

   3.  IPadd continuity: provides stable IP address

   4.  backhaul friendly: reduces burden on backhaul

   5.  app friendly: apps do not require new code

   6.  server-friendly: server state minimized, servers do not require
       new code

   7.  local routing: "local breakout" / "hairpinning" / local traffic
       routed locally

   8.  low signaling: not too much signaling required







2.  Matrix Comparing Existing Approaches for DMM

   The following matrix rates the approaches described in the the
   previous section according to the characteristics listed.

3.  Explanations for Matrix Entries

   Most of the matrix entries are relatively self-evident.  For
   instance, "Trans Mob" (Transport-based Mobility) approaches are rated
   as not "app friendly" because applications require changes in order
   to make use of the approach.

   For approaches that are identified generically, it is ambiguous
   whether or not they are properly specified in any working group
   document.  Here, such approaches are characterized as specified if
   any particular approach in the generic family is specified.  More
   detail may be needed in the future, in which case more columns or a
   new table may be needed.

   In this initial pre-release of the document, not too many
   explanations have been supplied.  If the document is considered
   worthwhile, explanations for more matrix entries will be developed,
   concentrating first on those entries which have received mailing list
   attention.

3.1.  Route Optimization

   Mobile IPv6 supports route optimization mode and bi-directional
   tunnel mode.  In route optimization mode, the mobile node can send
   mobility signalling and subsequently data packets directly to the
   correspondent node.  The following aspects of route optimization are
   characterized in the comparison matrix.

Internet-Draft            DMM Comparison Matrix                 Jul 2011


   1.  Scalability: In route optimization mode, the signalling and data
       could be sent without through the centralized mobility anchor.
       So there is no single point of failure in RO mode.  Moreover, the
       effect of route optimization is to reduce traffic through the
       home network -- therefore there is no scalability issue.

   2.  Specified: RFC 3775 specifies the route optimization mode of
       MIPv6.

   3.  IP address continuity: In MIPv6 route optimization mode, the
       mobile node still uses the same home address as the bi-
       directional tunnel mode.  RO mode supports IP address continuity.

   4.  backhaul friendly: In RO mode, the data can send directly to the
       CN.  Data do not need to send through centralized moblity anchor,
       thence RO is backhaul friendly.

   5.  app friendly: RO mode does not require application changing, so
       it is application friendly.

   6.  server-friendly: RO mode requires the server (i.e., CN) to also
       support Mobile IP RO mode.  In this sense, RO is not server
       friendly.

   7.  local routing: In RO mode, the data is forwarded directly between
       MN and CN, it thence can support local routing.

   8.  low signaling: MIPv6 RO mode use the return routability
       procedure. which requires more signalling than MIPv6 bi-
       directional tunnel mode.

3.2.  Source address selection refinements

   Dummy text here.  Source address selection refinements (SAddrSel): MN
   picks source address appropriate for current point of attachment when
   launching an application.

3.3.  Dynamically allocated home agent

   Dynamically allocated home agent (DynHA): Mobility anchor for MN is
   allocated on demand.

   Scalability: If the network supports dynamically allocated home
   agents, the mobile node can choose the nearest home agent.  Other
   mobile nodes can use different home agents.  But when changing
   location, home agent may not be able to change accordingly.  The
   mechanism for associating home agents to mobile nodes can vary, and
   different algorithms have different scalability characteristics; some

   may be more scalable than others.  Method relying on anycast
   addresses for home agents are among the more scalable approaches.

   Specified: RFC 3775 specifies dynamic home agent address discovery
   and dynamic home prefix discovery.  But it does not support changing
   home agent after the mobility session setting up.

   IP address continuity: When mobile node changes location, it may
   choose a new home agent, but home address would also need to change
   accordingly.

   backhaul friendly: The mobile node can choose the nearest home agent,
   in this sense, it is backhaul friendly.

   app friendly: application does not need to change to support
   dynamically allocated home agent.  So it is app friendly.

   server-friendly: server does not need to change to support
   dynamically allocated home agent, so it is server friendly.

   Local routing: When mobile node selecting the nearest home agent, it
   can support local routing in some degree.

   Low signaling: Dynamical discovery and assignment of a home agent may
   need additionally signaling.

3.4.  Binding updates to CN even without HA

   Dummy text here.  Binding updates to CN even without HA (CN-wo-HA):
   Similar to RO, but does not require protocol signaling with home
   agent.

3.5.  Transport protocol

   Dummy text here.  Transport protocol (Trans-Mob) : MN modifies
   transport (e.g., TCP, SCTP, DCCP, MPTCP) protocol parameters to
   change the IP address of transport connection endpoint

3.6.  Local anchor

   Dummy text here.  Local anchor (Anchor-Mob): Local mobility anchor
   (e.g., MAP in HMIP [RFC5380]) available for use by MN at its current
   point of attachment.

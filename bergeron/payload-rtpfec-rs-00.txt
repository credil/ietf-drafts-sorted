    Internet-Draft RTP Payload Format for Reed-Solomon FEC    February 2011

    Abstract 

       This document defines a new RTP payload type for the insertion of 
       Forward Error Correction (FEC) in RTP. This solution is based on 
       Reed-Solomon codes that protect the transmission both from packet 
       losses and bit errors which may affect the communication over 
       wireless links. These codes are systematic, thus being completely 
       transparent to FEC unaware RTP clients. The new payload defined in 



       this draft and the insertion of RS codes are particularly suited for 
       H.264 video streaming.

    Internet-Draft RTP Payload Format for Reed-Solomon FEC    February 2011 
        
        
    1. Introduction 

       The introduction of Forward Error Correction (FEC) at high level of 
       the OSI stack can be done in several different ways. In particular, 
       as a direct insertion inside the data stream, i.e., at the 
       application level, or as an insertion after encapsulation in RTP 
       packets or on transport packets (UDP, DCCP, SCTP, ...).  

       The idea of using FEC for RTP packets is not new, and some proposals 
       have already been presented at the IETF. However, the RTP-FEC 
       approach defined in [RFC2733] presents the drawback of tagging as 
       "RTP FEC" redundancy packets. This implies that an unaware receiver, 
       i.e., a receiver not specifically enhanced by the RTP-FEC feature, 
       would discard all packets.

       Work in [RFC6015]  has a similar approach to the one presented in 
       this document: the solution presented here proposes an alternative 
       insertion of FEC in RTP, providing correction not only of packet 
       losses but also of bit errors.  This scheme, based on Reed-Solomon 
       codes, reduced moreover the overhead associated to the FEC headers. 

    2. Encoding/decoding at transport layer 

       This section provides an overview of the encoding and decoding 
       process. 

       The packet-level encoder forwards the packets received from the upper 
       layer immediately to the lower layers to avoid the introduction of 
       significant extra-delay. Such packets are called source packets. The 
       encoding process starts when either a sufficient amount of data is 
       available. 

       Regardless the specific (N,K) packet-level code that is employed, 
       encoding starts by filling with the source packets an encoding table, 
       also called the source block, consisting of N=K+M rows, each of T 
       bytes, indexed from 1 to n. Each such row is called a symbol. The 
       generic source block is filled with progressive RTP packets. 

       At the decoder, source or repair packets may be missing. Moreover, 
       both correct and corrupted packets (either source or repair) are 
       received. Packet losses may be due to erasures along the IPv6 
       network, errors in the DLL/IP/UDP/RTP headers caused by the 
       transmission across a radio channel or selective drops operated by an 
       intelligent transport network. The possible presence of partially 
       corrupted RTP packets (i.e., packets which are recognized as 
       corrupted, but without errors in the header) is due to the use of 
       transport protocols like UDP-Lite or to a partial CRC at the data 
       link layer like introduced in WiMAX and represents an important

       issue, since a robust source decoder may be able to exploit them to 
       improve the end-to-end quality. At the decoder, the correctly 
       received (source and repair) packets are filled into a decoding 
       source block, analogous to the source block in the encoder.  Decoding 
       consists of recovering the missing T-byte symbols from erasures and, 
       if partially corrupted RTP packets are received, correct the errors 
       affecting the corresponding symbols. 

    3. Reed-Solomon (RS) codes 

       Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are non-binary systematic cyclic error-
       correcting codes invented by I. Reed and G. Solomon [1] and detecting 
       and correcting multiple random symbol errors.  

       The Reed-Solomon code is an optimum [N, K, N-K+1] code: in other 
       words, it is a linear block code of length N with dimension K and 
       minimum Hamming distance N-K+1. Moreover, the minimum distance has 
       the maximum possible value for a linear code of size (N,K). 

       The error-correcting ability of a Reed-Solomon code is determined by 
       its minimum distance, or, equivalently, by N - K, the measure of 
       redundancy in the block. If the locations of the error symbols are 
       not known in advance, then a Reed-Solomon code can correct up to (N - 
       K) / 2 erroneous symbols, i.e., it can correct half as many errors as 
       there are redundant symbols added to the block. As an erasure code, 
       it can correct up to N - K known erasures. Moreover, it can detect 
       and correct combinations of errors and erasures: a Reed-Solomon code 
       is able to correct any combination of errors and erasures as long as 
       the relation 2E + L = N - K is satisfied, where E is the number of 
       errors and L is the number of erasures in the block. 

       For practical uses of Reed-Solomon codes, it is common to fix a 
       finite field F with 2m elements. In this case, each symbol can be 
       represented as an m-bit value. The sender transmits the data points 
       as encoded blocks, and the number of symbols in the encoded block is 
       N = 2m - 1. Thus a Reed-Solomon code operating on 8-bit symbols has N 
       = 28 - 1 = 255 symbols per block. The number K (with K < N) of data 
       symbols in the block is a design parameter. 

       The above properties of Reed-Solomon codes make them especially well 
       suited to applications where errors occur in bursts. Moreover, being 
       systematic, they allow sending information bits untouched and adding 
       redundancy bits thus being fully transparent for a user unaware of 
       the Forward Error Correction (FEC) feature.

    4. Source packets 

       In the introduction of RS codes in RTP, source packets are RTP 
       packets as defined in [RFC3984]. This guarantees that non-FEC capable 
       receives could  interpret the received source packets. 

    5. Repair packets 

       For the generation of repair packets, the RTP encoder builds a matrix 
       of K rows where every row corresponds to an RTP source packet. The K 
       source RTP data packets are transmitted to the receiver followed by M 
       = N- K RS packets generated by interleaving 1 byte of each RTP data 
       packet.  

       The dimension K, i.e., the number of source packets in the matrix, is 
       a parameter of the system. 

       However, it may happen that, in case of a H.264 video packetization, 
       the Kth packet may be in the middle of a Network Abstraction Layer 
       (NAL). In order to avoid the split of a NAL into two different 
       matrix, additional RTP packets COULD be inserted in the matrix, up to 
       the completion of the NAL transmission. It follows that a number 
       K'=K+k of RTP  source packets are inserted in the matrix, with 
       k=NALsize-K. 

       The matrix size N is instead  dimensioned on the maximum RTP packet 
       size Smax plus 2 additional bytes for packet size indication, as 
       depicted in Figure 1. 

       The rational behind this choice is as follows. RTP packets have a 
       variable size S, which can assume a value between 13 bytes (i.e., an 
       header size of 12 bytes and a payload of one byte) and Smax. At the 
       receiver side, in case of losses,  the amount of lost data (i.e., the 
       packet size) is needed for the  recovery process: this extra 
       information SHOULD be appended to the RTP source packets while 
       inserting them in the matrix. The packet size S, virtually inserted 
       in the matrix and thus considered in the generation of the RS repair 
       packets, SHELL NOT be really transmitted to the receiver: at the 
       receiver side, the payload length can be recovered from the RS 
       packets in case of losses, since it has been included in the 
       computation of the protection. 

       This solution has a general validity and it can be applied to any 
       kind of data packet. It has however to be noticed that for H.264 
       video frames the addition of the 2 Bytes for the payload size MAY be 
       skipped. Indeed, in H.264 video frames there are no more than two 
       consecutive bits equal to zero. If follows that, if there are three 
       or more bits equal to zero in the received packets, those bits are of

       padding: in that case, the end of the packet can be identified by 
       looking, starting from the end of the packet, for the first bit 
       different from zero.

    5.1. Information for FEC decoding 

       The following information MUST be known at the receiver side for a 
       correct decoding: 

       o The Sequence Number (SBN) of the first RTP Packet to take in 
       consideration, i.e., the first packet of the matrix. 

       o The parameters of the RS codes, i.e., N and K (we assume to work on 
       GF(256)). 

       o The size of the payload. 

       o The size of the matrix.

    Internet-Draft RTP Payload Format for Reed-Solomon FEC    February 2011 
   

      As explained above: 

       o The size of the matrix corresponds to Smax+2, and thus it does not 
       require to be transmitted; 

       o The size of the payload is virtually added in the matrix and thus 
       can be determined by the receiver. 

       Moreover, N MAY be considered equal to 255 at the decoder: indeed, a 
       RS(55,25) is equivalent to a RS(255,25) where the last 200 packets 
       are considered lost as depicted in Figure 2. 

       We SHOULD thus avoid transmitting this information while signaling to 
       the receiver only the parameter K and the Sequence Number. 

        
    5.2. RTP Extra-Header 

       The repair packets are characterized by an "Extra-header" of four 
       Bytes following the RTP header and reporting, as depicted in Figure 
       3: 

       o the SBN (2B) 

       o K' (1B only considering a maximum number of rows N of 255). 

       o An RS code on the extra-header (1B). It has to be noticed that SBN 
          and k' have the same values for all the packets in the same 
          matrix: in case of errors, values can be obtained from the other 
          correct packets of the matrix. One byte of protection is thus 
          enough to offer a good reliability with a minimum overhead.

   5.2.1. Repair packet payload type 

       The M RS repair packets are characterized by a new payload type. The 
       use of a new payload type (e.g., no. 99) assures the compliance to 
       RTP receivers not supporting FEC. At the receiver side, one 
       depacketisers is used for both data and redundancy packets: if RTP 
       FEC packets are received by a client not supporting the RTP FEC mode, 
       the packets with an unknown payload type (i.e, 99) are simply 
       discarded. An RTP FEC receiver would instead decode the RS packet and 
       correct the eventual errors or losses.  

       The repair packets are identified by an X field with a value equal to 
       the new Payload Type (PT) in the RTP header. 
        

    6. Security Considerations 

       RTP packets using the format defined in this specification are 
       subject to the security considerations of the RTP specification 
       [RTP3350]. 

       The repair packets as presented in this document do not cause 
       specific additional security issues. 

    7. IANA Considerations 

       There are no IANA considerations in this document.

Internet-Draft           Suite B in Kerberos 5                 June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Fact Sheet on National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B Cryptography
   [NSA] states:

      A Cryptographic Interoperability Strategy (CIS) was developed to
      find ways to increase assured rapid sharing of information both
      within the U.S. and between the U.S. and her partners through
      the use of a common suite of public standards, protocols,
      algorithms and modes referred to as the "Secure Sharing Suite"
      or S.3 The implementation of CIS will facilitate the development
      of a broader range of secure cryptographic products which will
      be available to a wide customer base.  The use of selected
      public cryptographic standards and protocols and Suite B is the
      core of CIS.

      In 2005, NSA announced Suite B Cryptography which built upon the
      National Policy on the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard
      (AES) to Protect National Security Systems and National Security
      Information.  In addition to the AES algorithm, Suite B includes 
      cryptographic algorithms for key exchanges, digital signatures 
      and hashing.  Suite B cryptography has been selected from 
      cryptography that has been approved by NIST for use by the U.S. 
      Government and specified in NIST standards or recommendations.

   This document specifies the use of the United States National
   Security Agency's Suite B algorithms [NSA] in Kerberos 5.
   Symmetric key encryption algorithms and checksum types are
   specified for use in the protocol.  Additionally, the use of
   elliptic curve cryptography in the initial authentication protocol
   (PKINIT) is specified.

2.  Conventions used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Suite B Requirements

   Suite B requires that key establishment and signature algorithms be
   based upon Elliptic Curve Cryptography and that the encryption
   algorithm be AES [FIPS197].

Internet-Draft           Suite B in Kerberos 5                 June 2011


   Suite B includes [NSA]:

      Encryption:         Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [FIPS197]
                          (key sizes of 128 and 256 bits)
      Digital Signature:  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
                          (ECDSA) [FIPS186-3] (using the curves with
                          256- and 384-bit prime moduli)
      Key Exchange:       Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
                          [SP800-56A] (using the curves with 256- and
                          384-bit prime moduli)
      Hashes:             SHA-256 and SHA-384 [FIPS180-3]

   The two elliptic curves used in Suite B each appear in the literature
   under two different names.  For sake of clarity, we list both names
   below:

      Curve       NIST Name    SECG Name    OID  [FIPS186-3]
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      nistp256    P-256        secp256r1    1.2.840.10045.3.1.7
      nistp384    P-384        secp384r1    1.3.132.0.34

4.  Minimum Levels of Security (minLOS)

   Suite B provides for two levels of cryptographic security, namely a
   128-bit minimum level of security (minLOS_128) and a 192-bit
   minimum level of security (minLOS_192).  Each level defines a
   minimum strength that all cryptographic algorithms must provide.

4.1.  Non-signature Primitives

   We divide the Suite B non-signature primitives into two columns as
   shown in Table 1.

                            Column 1            Column 2
                       +-------------------+------------------+
      Encryption       |    AES-128        |    AES-256       |
                       +-------------------+------------------+
      Key Agreement    |    ECDH on P-256  |    ECDH on P-384 |
                       +-------------------+------------------+
      Hash for PRF/MAC |    SHA-256        |    SHA-384       |
                       +-------------------+------------------+
       Table 1: Suite B Cryptographic Non-Signature Primitives

   At the 128-bit minimum level of security:

      - the non-signature primitives MUST either come exclusively from
        Column 1 or exclusively from Column 2.

Internet-Draft           Suite B in Kerberos 5                 June 2011


   At the 192-bit minimum level of security:

      - the non-signature primitives MUST come exclusively from
        Column 2.

4.2.  Digital Signatures and Certificates

   Digital signatures using ECDSA MUST be used for authentication by
   Suite B compliant implementations.  To simplify notation, ECDSA-256
   will be used to represent an instantiation of the ECDSA algorithm
   using the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash function, and ECDSA-384
   will be used to represent an instantiation of the ECDSA algorithm
   using the P-384 curve and the SHA-384 hash function.

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits, a Suite B
   Kerberos implementation MUST use either ECDSA-256 or ECDSA-384 for
   authentication.  It is allowable for one party to authenticate with
   ECDSA-256 and the other party to authenticate with ECDSA-384.  This
   flexibility will allow interoperability between a client and a
   server that have different sizes of ECDSA authentication keys.

   Clients and servers in a Suite B Kerberos implementation configured
   at a minimum level of security of 128 bits MUST be able to verify
   ECDSA-256 signatures and SHOULD be able to verify ECDSA-384
   signatures unless it is absolutely certain that the implementation
   will never need to verify certificates from an authority which uses
   an ECDSA-384 signing key.

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 192 bits, ECDSA-384
   MUST be used by both parties for authentication.

   Clients and servers in a Suite B Kerberos implementation configured
   at a minimum level of security of 192 bits MUST be able to verify
   ECDSA-384 signatures.

   The client and server, at both minimum levels of security, MUST
   each have an X.509 certificate that complies with the Suite B End 
   Entity Signature Certificate profile as defined in [RFC5759].

5.  PKINIT

   This section specifies the use of Suite B algorithms for
   integrating public key cryptography into the initial authentication
   protocol (PKINIT).  The use of public key certificates and
   signature schemes allows the client and KDC to mutually
   authenticate in the Authentication Service (AS) request and reply.
   Furthermore, without PKINIT, the security strength of the AS reply 
   key is usually determined by the strength of the user's password.  
   Using a public key cryptography key exchange eliminates the

Internet-Draft           Suite B in Kerberos 5                 June 2011


   dependency of the AS reply key on a password, enhancing the security 
   of the Kerberos protocol.

   The original protocol extensions which include public key
   cryptography are described in PKINIT [RFC4556] and specifications
   for using elliptic curve cryptography are presented in ECC for
   PKINIT [RFC5349].  The majority of the conventions needed for Suite
   B are in those two documents and only the necessary details are
   provided here.

   In Suite B, public key cryptography (PKINIT) MUST be used in the
   initial authentication protocol to avoid the need for password-
   based authentication.  As defined in [RFC4556], one of the
   following pre-authentication data elements MUST be included in the
   AS_REQ and AS_REP messages.

      padata-type    Name            Included in
      ------------------------------------------
      16             PA_PK_AS_REQ    AS_REQ
      17             PA_PK_AS_REP    AS_REP

   The specific requirements for using ECDH and ECDSA in PKINIT are
   presented in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 respectively.

5.1.  Algorithm Agility

   PKINIT [RFC4556] has several dependencies on SHA-1 as a checksum
   algorithm.  The first occurrence is the paChecksum field of the
   PKAuthenticator structure in the authentication request which is
   defined to contain the SHA-1 checksum of the KDC-REQ-BODY.  PKINIT
   also requires SHA-1 in the key derivation function used to derive
   the AS reply key from the shared secret value generated by the
   Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  Since Suite B requires SHA-256 or
   SHA-384 for hashing, the client and KDC need a method to negotiate
   the hash algorithm used in PKINIT.

   [alg-agility] updates PKINIT by allowing the client and KDC to
   negotiate a KDF from [SP800-56A] which will provide integrity of
   the request body as well as a cryptographic binding between the
   client's pre-authentication data and the corresponding request
   body.  This is achieved as described in Section 6 of [alg-agility]
   by including the AS-REQ and PA-PK-AS-REP messages and the ticket
   from the KDC in the OtherInfo input parameter to the KDF.

   Choosing a KDF from [SP800-56A] that uses SHA-256 or SHA-384
   as the hash function therefore eliminates the need for the
   paChecksum field.  In Suite B, the client MUST NOT include the
   SHA-1 checksum of the KDC-REQ-BODY in the paChecksum field of the
   authentication request since the KDF will provide the desired

   cryptographic binding and integrity protection.  The KDC MUST NOT
   return a KRB-ERROR message due to the absence of the paChecksum field
   when validating the client's request since the paChecksum field is 
   optional syntactically in [RFC4556].  Section 6 of [alg-agility] 
   describes the new structures and fields included in the AS request 
   and reply messages.

   In Suite B, one of the following KDFs defined in [alg-agility] MUST
   be used to derive the AS reply key from the Diffie-Hellman shared
   secret.

      Key Derivation Function      OID  [alg-agility]
      -----------------------------------------------
      id-pkinit-kdf-ah-sha256      1.3.6.1.5.2.3.6.2
      id-pkinit-kdf-ah-sha384      TBD

5.2.  ECDH Key Exchange

   The use of elliptic curve cryptography in PKINIT is described in
   [RFC5349].  This section describes the Suite B requirements for
   using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to generate the AS reply
   key.

   In Suite B, ephemeral-ephemeral ECDH MUST be used as the AS reply
   key agreement method.  In a Suite B Kerberos system configured at a
   minimum level of security of 128 bits, ephemeral-ephemeral ECDH
   MUST be used with the SHA-256 KDF and the P-256 elliptic curve or
   used with the SHA-384 KDF and the P-384 elliptic curve.  In a Suite
   B Kerberos system configured at a minimum level of security of 192
   bits, ephemeral-ephemeral ECDH MUST be used with the SHA-384 KDF
   and the P-384 elliptic curve.  A detailed description of the uses
   of the ECDH key exchange in PKINIT is provided in [RFC5349].

   The client MUST include its encoded ECDH ephemeral public key value
   and domain parameters in the clientPublicValue field of the
   AuthPack structure as described in [RFC4556].  The clientPublicValue
   field MUST comply with the SubjectPublicKeyInfo guidance in [RFC5759] 
   Section 4.4.  The domain parameters in the clientPublicValue field 
   MUST be for one of the following curves.  Since the curves appear 
   under two different names, both names are listed below.

      Curve       NIST Name    SECG Name    OID  [FIPS186-3]
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      nistp256    P-256        secp256r1    1.2.840.10045.3.1.7
      nistp384    P-384        secp384r1    1.3.132.0.34

   A description of the two curves can be found in [FIPS186-3] or
   [SEC2].

Internet-Draft           Suite B in Kerberos 5                 June 2011


   The KDC MUST include its encoded ECDH ephemeral public key value in
   the subjectPublicKey field of the KDCDHKeyInfo structure in the
   authentication reply.  Section 2.2 of [RFC5480] provides guidance on 
   the format of the subjectPublicKey field.  The KDC MUST NOT reuse its 
   DH keys, even if the client includes the clientDHNonce field.  
   Section 5.6.4.3 of [SP800-56A] states that an ephemeral private key 
   MUST be used in exactly one key establishment transaction, SHOULD be 
   generated as close to its time of use as possible and MUST be 
   zeroized after its use.  Section 5.8 of [SP800-56A] states that the 
   Diffie-Hellman shared secret MUST be zeroized immediately after its 
   use.  Suite B Kerberos implementations MUST follow the mandates in 
   SP800-56A.

   The ECDH shared secret value (Z) is calculated using the ECSVDP-DH
   primitive described in Section 7.2.1 of [IEEE1363].  Note this
   primitive is also described in Section 5.7.1.2 of [SP800-56A] under
   the name ECC CDH.

   The AS reply key is derived from the ECDH shared secret value using
   a negotiated key derivation function from [SP800-56A] with the
   method described in Section 6 of [alg-agility].  The KDF based on
   SHA-256 MUST be used when ECDH is used with the 256-bit prime
   modulus elliptic curve and the KDF based on SHA-384 MUST be used
   when ECDH is used with the 384-bit prime modulus elliptic curve.
   Additional guidance on implementing the Ephemeral Unified Model Key
   Agreement Scheme for Suite B is provided in [IG].

5.3.  ECDSA and X.509 Certificates

   The use of elliptic curve signature schemes in PKINIT is described
   in [RFC5349].  This section describes the use of digital signatures
   and certificates that are compatible with Suite B.

   The signatureAlgorithm field of the SignerInfo data type in both the
   AS request and reply messages MUST contain one of the following
   signature algorithm identifiers:

      Signature Algorithm          OID [FIPS186-3]
      ------------------------------------------------
      ecdsa-with-Sha256            1.2.840.10045.4.3.2
      ecdsa-with-Sha384            1.2.840.10045.4.3.3

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits, a Suite B 
   Kerberos client MUST list one or both of ecdsa-with-sha256 and 
   ecdsa-with-sha384 in the supportedCMSTypes field of the 
   authentication request as the only acceptable signature algorithms 
   for the server's response.  If configured at a minimum level of 
   security of 192 bits, a Suite B Kerberos client MUST list 
   ecdsa-with-sha384 in the supportedCMSTypes field of the

   authentication request as the only acceptable signature algorithm for 
   the server's response.

   The corresponding digestAlgorithm field of the SignerInfo data type
   MUST contain one of the following hash algorithm identifiers.

      Hash Algorithm               OID [FIPS180-3]
      ---------------------------------------------------
      id-sha256                    2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.2
      id-sha384                    2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.3

   id-sha256 MUST be used with ecdsa-with-Sha256 and id-sha384 MUST be
   used with ecdsa-with-Sha384, as noted in [RFC5349].

6.  Encryption and Checksum Types

   Encryption and checksum types for Kerberos 5 are described in
   [RFC3961] and specifications for using AES in Kerberos 5 are
   detailed in [RFC3962].  The dependencies of those types on SHA-1 make 
   them inappropriate choices for Suite B.  [AES-CBC-SHA2] defines the
   encryption and checksum types required by Suite B.

6.1.  Suite B Requirements

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits, a Suite B
   Kerberos implementation MUST use either the combination of 
   aes128-cbc-hmac-sha256-128 for content encryption and 
   hmac-sha256-128-aes-128 for message integrity or the combination of 
   aes256-cbc-hmac-sha384-192 for content encryption and 
   hmac-sha384-192-aes256 for message integrity.  

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 192 bits, a Suite B 
   Kerberos implementation MUST use aes256-cbc-hmac-sha384-192 for 
   content encryption and hmac-sha384-192-aes256 for message integrity.

   If the Suite B Kerberos client is using ECDH P-256 for its ephemeral 
   public key in its request, it MUST list aes128-cbc-hmac-sha256-128 in 
   the etype field of the req-body in the initial request message.  If 
   the Suite B Kerberos client is using ECDH P-384 for its ephemeral 
   public key in its request, it MUST list aes256-cbc-hmac-sha384-192 in 
   the etype field of the req-body in the initial request message.

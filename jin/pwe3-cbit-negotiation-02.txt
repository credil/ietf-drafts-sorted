1. Introduction

   This draft describes the problem of control word negotiation 
   mechanism specified in [RFC4447]. Based on the problem analysis, a 
   message exchanging mechanism is introduced to solve this negotiation 
   issue. The control word negotiation mechanism in this draft is to 
   update [RFC4447] section 6.2 "PW Types for Which the Control Word is 
   NOT Mandatory".

2. Problem Statement

   [RFC4447] section 6 describes the control word negotiation mechanism. 
   Each PW endpoint has the capability of being configurable with a 
   parameter that specifies whether the use of the control word is 
   PREFERRED or NOT PREFERRED. While in some case of control word 
   negotiation, PE will advertise C-bit=0 in label mapping message with 
   its locally configured control word PREFERRED. This kind of behavior 
   will cause some problem when peer PE changes its control word from 
   NOT PREFERRED to PREFERRED.

   This following case will describe the negotiation problem in detail:

             +-------+                    +-------+
             |       |         PW         |       |
             |  PE1  |====================|  PE2  |
             |       |                    |       |
             +-------+                    +-------+
                            Figure 1

       1. Initially, the control word on PE1 is configured to PREFERRED, 
          and on PE2 to NOT PREFERRED.

       2. The negotiation result for the control word for this PW is 
          "not supported", and PE1 send label mapping with C-bit=0 
          finally.

       3. PE2 then changes its control word configuration to PREFERRED.

       4. PE2 will then send label withdraw message to PE1.

       5. According to the control word negotiation mechanism, the 
          received label mapping on PE2 from PE1 indicates C-bit=0, 
          therefore PE2 will still send label mapping with C-bit=0.

   The negotiation result for the PW control word is still "not 
   supported", even though the control word configuration on both PE1 
   and PE2 is set to PREFERRED.

3. Control word re-negotiation by label request message

   In order to solve this problem, the control word re-negotiation is 
   operated by adding label request message. The control word 
   negotiation mechanism can still follow the procedure described in 
   [RFC4447] section 6.

   When Local PE changes its control word from NOT PREFERRED to 
   PREFERRED and only if it already received the remote label mapping 
   message with C-bit=0, additional procedure will be added as follow:

         -i. Local PE sends label withdraw message to the remote if it 
             already sends label mapping message, for it has changed its 
             control word parameter.

        -ii. Local PE MUST send a label request messages to peer PE to 
             get peer's configured control word parameter before sending 
             new label mapping message to peer PE.

       -iii. After receiving the new label mapping message from peer PE 
             and updating the remote label binding information, the 
             Local PE should send label mapping to peer PE according to 
             procedures defined in [RFC4447].

   When the peer PE receives a label request message, it MUST send label 
   mapping with locally configured control word parameter.

   The multi-segment PW case for T-PE is same, and the request message 
   MUST be processed in ordered mode. When S-PE receives a label request 
   message from a remote peer, it MUST advertise the request message to 
   the other remote PE. This is necessary since S-PE does not have full 
   information of interface parameter field in the FEC advertisement.

   When Local PE changes its control word from PREFERRED to NOT 
   PREFERRED, Local PE would be able to re-negotiate the Control Word to 
   be NOT PREFERRED following the procedures defined in [RFC4447], and 
   no label request message to peer PE will be needed. In that case, 
   Local PE will always send label mapping with C-bit reflecting the 
   local Control Word configuration.

   The procedure of PE1 and PE2 for the case in figure 1 should be as 
   follows:

       1. PE2 changes locally configured control word to PREFERRED.

       2. PE2 will then send label withdraw message to PE1.

       3. PE2 MUST send label request messages to PE1 although it 
          already received the label mapping with C-bit=0.

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-pwe3-cbit-negotiation-02      December 2010


       4. PE1 will send label release in reply to label withdraw message 
          from PE2.

       5. PE1 will send label mapping message with C-bit=1 again to PE2 
          (Note: PE1 MUST send label mapping with locally configured CW 
           parameter).

       6. PE2 receives the label mapping from PE1 and updates the remote 
          label binding information. PE2 MUST wait for PE1 label binding 
          before sending its label binding with C-bit set, only if it 
          previously had a label binding with C-bit = 0 from PE1.

       7. PE2 will send label mapping to PE1 with C-bit=1.

   By sending label request message, PE2 will get the configured CW 
   parameter of peer PE1 in the received label mapping message. By using 
   the new CW parameter from label mapping message received from peer 
   PE1 and locally configured CW, PE2 should determine the PW CW 
   parameter according to [RFC4447] section 6.

   negotiation diagram in [RFC4447] Appendix A.

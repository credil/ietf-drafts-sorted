Abstract

   This document describes a number of communication performance
   requirements that are imposed by traffic safety applications on a
   network layer.  These traffic safety applications and requirements
   have been derived by the USA VSC (Vehicle Safety 
   Communications)and VSC-A (VSC-Applications) projects and by the 
   European Car to Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) and the ETSI TC 
   ITS standardization body. The goal of this document is to stimulate 
   the discussion on judging whether these performance requirements 
   could or could not be supported (currently and in the future) by IP 
   based network solutions.

1.  Introduction

   Vehicular networking can be considered as one of the most important
   enabling technologies needed to support various types of traffic
   applications, such as infotainment type of applications, traffic
   efficiency & management and traffic safety applications.

   Traffic safety applications are those that are primarily applied to
   decrease the probability of traffic accidents and the loss of life of
   the occupants of vehicles.  Note that VSC and VSC-A projects focus on
   vehicle-to-vehicle safety.  Another project called CICAS-V
   (Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance Systems - Violation)
   discuss the traffic safety application over vehicle-to-infrastructure
   communication.

   Traffic efficiency & management applications are focusing on
   improving the vehicle traffic flow, traffic coordination and traffic
   assistance.  Moreover, traffic efficiency & management applications
   are focusing on providing updated local information, maps and in
   general messages of relevance limited in space and/or time, which are 
   not specifically used to decrease the probability of traffic 
   accidents and/or the loss of life of the occupants of vehicles.
 

   Infotainment types of applications are the applications that are
   neither traffic safety applications nor traffic efficiency &
   management applications.  Such applications are supported by e.g.,
   media downloading use cases.  This document describes a number of
   communication performance requirements that are imposed by traffic
   safety applications on a network layer.  
   These traffic safety applications and requirements have been derived 
   by:
      o the USA VSC (Vehicle Safety Communications) and VSC-A (VSC-
        Applications) projects.  
      O the European Car-to-Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) 
        [C2C-CC] and the ETSI TC ITS [ETSI TC ITS], with the additional
        support of some EU funded research projects, such as SEVECOM 
        [SEVECOM], SAFESPOT [SAFESPOT], CVIS [CVIS]. PREDRIVE-C2x 
        [PREDRIVE-C2x], GEONET [GEONET].

   The USA Vehicle Safety Communications (VSC) consortium, see
   [VSC], is supported among others by CAMP (Crash Avoidance Metrics
   Partnership).  CAMP is a partnership that has been formed in 1995 by
   Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation.  The objective of
   CAMP is to accelerate the implementation of crash avoidance
   countermeasures to improve traffic safety by investigating and
   developing new technologies.  VSC has been realized in two phases.

   The first phase, denoted as VSC started in 2002 and ended in 2004.
   The second phase started in 2006 and ends in 2009.  VSC focused and
   is focusing on traffic safety related applications.  In 2006, The VSC
   2 consortium in cooperation with USDOT initiated a three-year
   collaborative effort in the area of wireless-based safety
   applications under the Vehicle Safety Communications - Applications
   (VSC-A) project, see [VSC-A].  The VSC2 consortium consists of the
   following members; Mercedes-Benz, Ford, General Motors, Honda &
   Toyota.  The main goal of this project is to develop and test
   communications-based vehicle safety systems to determine whether
   vehicle positioning in combination with the DSRC at 5.9 GHz can
   improve the autonomous vehicle-based safety systems and/or enable new
   communication-based safety applications.

   The WAVE Short Message Protocol [IEEE 1609.3] was designed
   specifically to offer a more efficient (smaller size) alternative to
   TCP or UDP over IP, for 1-hop messages that require no routing.  The
   goal of this document is to stimulate the discussion on judging
   whether these communication performance requirements could or could
   not be (currently and in the future) supported by IP based network
   solutions.

   The European Car-to-Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) is 
   an industry consortium of car manufacturers and electronics suppliers 
   that focuses on the definition of an European standard for vehicular 
   communication protocols.

   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Technical
   Committee (TC) Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) was established in
   October 2007 with the goal of developing and maintaining standards,
   specifications and other deliverables to support the development and
   the implementation of ITS service provision. It is foreseen that ETSI 
   ITS will be the reference standardization body of the future European 
   ITS standards, and actually the C2C-CC provides recommendations to 
   the ETSI TC ITS.


2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document :

   On Board Unit (OBU)

      a processing and communication feature that is located in a
      vehicle, which provides an application runtime environment,
      positioning, security and communications functions and interfaces
      to other vehicles including human machine interfaces.  OBU is also
      known as OBE (On-Board Equipment).

   Road Side Unit (RSU)

      equipment located along highways, at traffic intersections and
      other type of locations where timely communications with vehicles
      are needed.  Each RSU includes DSRC radio, a positioning system
      and a router to route packets back through the infrastructure
      network.  RSU is also know as RSE (Road Side Equipment)

   vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v)

      (same as in [draft-ietf-mext-nemo-ro-automotive-req]): a generic
      communication mode in which data packets are exchanged between two
      vehicles, either directly or traversing multiple vehicles, without
      involving any node in the infrastructure.

   vehicle-to-infrastructure

      generic communication mode in which data packets sent by a vehicle
      traverse a network infrastructure.

   infrastructure-to-vehicle

      generic communication mode in which data packets received by a
      vehicle traverse a network infrastructure.

   Host vehicle

      a vehicle that at a certain moment in time uses the traffic safety
      application.

   Traffic safety application

      application that is primarily applied to decrease the probability
      of traffic accidents and the loss of life of the occupants of
      vehicles.

   Geographically-scoped broadcast (or geocast), see [C2C-CC_Manifesto]

      forwarding mechanism that is used to transport data from a single 
      node to all nodes within a geographically target area. The scope 
      is defined by the geographic region. The geographic region is 
      determined by a geometric shape, such as circle and rectangle.

   Geographical Unicast (or geounicast) see [C2C-CC_Manifesto]

      Forwarding mechanism that is used for unidirectional data 
      transport from a single node (source) to a single node 
      (destination) by means of direct communication or by multiple hops
      based on C2C Communication specific addresses that include node 
      identifier, geographical position, and time information.


   Geographically-scoped anycast (or geoanycast), see [C2C-CC_Manifesto]

      forwarding mechanism that transports data from a single node to 
      any of the nodes within a geographically area. Compared to 
      geographically-scoped broadcast, with geographically-scoped 
      anycast a packet is not forwarded inside of the geographic area
      when the packet has reached the area.


3.  Overview of VSC and VSC-A traffic safety applications

   In VSC, see [VSC] 34 vehicle application scenarios have been
   identified, evaluated and ranked.  From this evaluation, a subset of
   eight significant near- and mid-term traffic safety applications have
   been selected: (1) cooperative forward collision warning, (2) curve
   speed warning, (3) pre-crash sensing, (4) traffic signal violation
   warning, (5) lane-change warning, (6) emergency electronic brake
   light, (7) left turn assistant, (8) stop sign movement assistant.  A
   brief description of these applications is given below (for more
   details, see [VSC]):

   o  Traffic signal violation warning: it informs and warns the driver
      to stop at a legally prescribed location in the situation that the
      traffic signal indicates a stop and it is estimated that the
      driver will be in violation.

   o  Curve speed warning - Rollover Warning: aids the driver in
      negotiating and choosing appropriate curve speeds.

   o  Emergency Electronic Brake Lights: it is used to inform vehicles
      that a vehicle brakes hard.  In particular in this situation a
      warning message is sent to the vehicles moving behind the vehicle
      that brakes hard.

   o  Pre-crash sensing: it prepares the driver for an unavoidable and
      imminent collision.

Internet-Draft  Traffic safety applications requirements   February 2010


   o  Cooperative Forward Collision Warning: aids the driver in
      mitigating or avoiding collisions with the rear-end vehicles in
      the forward path of travel through driver notification or warnings
      of an unavoidable collision.  

   o  Left Turn Assistant: it informs the driver about oncoming traffic
      in order to assist him in making a left turn at a signalized
      intersection without a phasing left turn arrow.

   o  Lane Change Warning: it warns the driver if an intended lane
      change may cause a crash with a nearby moving vehicle.

   o  Stop Sign Movement Assistance: it warns the driver that the
      vehicle is nearby an intersection, which will be passed after
      having stopped at a stop sign.

   In the VSC-A project an additional investigation has been performed,
   on traffic safety applications that can be used in crash immitment
   scenarios, see [VSC-A].  The following 7 traffic safety applications
   have been selected for implementation in the VSC-A test bed.

   o  Emergency Electronic Brake Light: is a traffic safety application
      that is the same as the Emergency Electronic Brake Light
      application defined in the VSC project, see above.

   o  Forward Collision warning: is a traffic safety application that is
      the same as the Cooperative Forward Collision Warning application
      defined in the VSC project, see above.

   o  Intersection Movement Assist: is a traffic is intended to warn the
      driver of a vehicle when it is not safe to enter an intersection
      due to high collision probability with other vehicles.  It is
      similar to the Stop Sign Movement Assistance application defined
      in the VSC project, see above.

   o  Blind Spot Warning & Lane Change Warning: it is similar to the
      Lane Change Warning application defined in the VSC project, see
      above.  In the Blind Spot Warning application the driver of a host
      vehicle is informed that another vehicle is moving in an adjacent
      lane and that this vehicle is positioned in a blind spot zone of
      the host vehicle.

   o  Do Not Pass Warning: this is an application that was not
      investigated in the VSC project.  It is intended to warn the
      driver of a host vehicle during a passing maneuver attempt when a
      slower vehicle, ahead and in the same lane, cannot be safely
      passed using a passing zone which is occupied by vehicles with the
      opposite direction of travel.

Internet-Draft  Traffic safety applications requirements   February 2010


      In addition, the application provides advisory information that is 
      intended to inform the driver of the host vehicle that the passing 
      zone is occupied when a passing maneuver is not being attempted.

   o  Control Loss Warning: this is an application that was not
      investigated in the VSC project.  It is intended to enable the
      host vehicle to autonomously generate and broadcast a control- 
      loss event to surrounding vehicles.  Upon receiving this 
      information the surrounding vehicle determines the relevance of 
      the event and provides a warning to the driver, if appropriate.


4.  Overview of the European Car to Car Communication Consortium 
    traffic safety applications

   The Car to Car Communication Consortium specified a number of traffic 
   safety use cases. The following three are considered as being the 
   main traffic safety use cases, see [C2C-CC_Manifesto]:

     o Cooperative Forward Collision Warning: this use case tries to 
       provide assistance to the driver. Vehicles share information such 
       as position, speed and direction. This enables the prediction of 
       an imminent rear-end collision, by each vehicle monitoring the 
       behavior of its own driver and the information of neighboring 
       vehicles. If a potential risk is detected, the vehicle warns the 
       driver. This use case requires: the ability for all vehicles to 
       share  Information with each other over a distance of about 20 to 
       200 meters, accurate relative positioning of the vehicles, trust 
       relationships among the vehicles and a reasonable market 
       penetration (at least 10%).

     o Pre-Crash Sensing/Warning: this use case is similar to the 
       previous one, but in this case the collision is identified as 
       unavoidable, and then the involved vehicles exchange more precise 
       information to optimize the usage of actuators such as airbags, 
       seat belt pre-tensors, etc...
       This use case requires basically the same abilities that the 
       previous one, restricting the needed communication range to 20 to 
       100 meters, and adding the requirement of a fast and reliable 
       connection between the involved cars.

     o Hazardous Location V2V Notification: this use case is based on 
       the share of information that relates to dangerous locations on 
       the road, among vehicles, and also among vehicles and the road 
       infrastructure. On one hand, vehicles may detect the dangerous 
       locations from sensors in the vehicle or from events such as the 
       actuation of the ESP (Electronic Stability Program). 


Karagiannis, et al.      Expires August 25, 2010                [Page 9]


Internet-Draft  Traffic safety applications requirements   February 2010


       On the other hand, recipients of this information may use it to 
       properly configure active safety systems and/or warn the driver.
       This use case requires: vehicles to trust other vehicles and 
       roadside units, reasonable market penetration, the ability of 
       vehicles to share information about a specific geographic 
       location over multiple-hops and the ability to validate 
       information propagated through multiple hops.


5.  Overview of traffic safety communication performance requirements

   5.1 VSC and VSCA Traffic safety communication performance requirements

   The VSC consortium specified several performance communication
   requirements derived from the traffic safety applications, see
   Figure 1 and Figure 2 and [VSC].  The communication parameters used
   in Figure 1 and Figure 2 where specified in [VSC].  These are:

   o  Type of Communication: considers the (1) source-destination of
      the transmission (infrastructure-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-
      infrastructure, vehicle-to-vehicle), (2) direction of the
      transmission (one-way, two-way), and DSRC (IEEE 802.11p), see
      [DSRC], [IEEE 802.11p], communication, (3) source-reception of
      communication (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint).  Note that
      the protocol suite that is used in the VSC and VSC-A projects is
      the WAVE protocol suite, which is composed by the combination of
      IEEE 1609 protocol suite, see [IEEE 1609.1], [IEEE 1609.2], [IEEE
      1609.3], [IEEE 1609.4] and the IEEE 802.11p.

   o  Transmission Mode: Describes whether the transmission is triggered
      by an event (event-driven) or sent automatically at regular
      intervals (periodic)

   o  Minimum Frequency: defines the minimum rate at which a
      transmission should be repeated (e.g., 1 Hz).

   o  Allowable latency: defines the maximum duration of time allowable
      between when information is available for transmission (by the
      sender) and when it is received by the receiver (e.g., 100 msec).

   o  Data to be transmitted and/or received: describes the contents of
      the communication (e.g., vehicle location, speed and heading).
      Design considerations include whether or not vehicles make
      periodic broadcasts to identify their position on the roadway and
      how privacy is best maintained.

   o  Maximum required range of communications: defines the
      communication distance between two units (e.g., two vehicles) that
      is required to effectively support an application.

   Figure 2: Preliminary application scenario communication requirements
                           (part B), from [VSC]

   From these requirements, see also Section 4.6 of [VSC], the most 
   significant ones are:

   o  Message packet size: for all 8 scenarios, a message size of 200 to
      500 bytes is needed.

   o  Maximum required range of communication: for all 8 scenarios, a
      maximum required range of communication of 50 to 300 meters is
      needed.

   o  During 7 of the 8 scenarios, one-way, point to multipoint
      broadcast messages were used.

   o  During 1 of the 8 scenarios, Two-way, point to point messages

   o  During 6 or 7 of the 8 scenarios, the periodic transmission
      mode is used.

   o  During 1 or 2 scenarios, Event-driven transmission mode is
      used.

   o  During 6 of the 8 scenarios an allowable latency of 100
      milliseconds is needed.

   o  During 1 of the 8 scenarios an allowable latency of 20 milliseconds
      is needed.

   o  During 1 of the 8 scenarios an allowable latency of 1 second is
      needed.

   In addition to these communication performance requirements the VSC
   project derived the network constraints, depicted in Figure 3, see
   Appendix H of [VSC].

          Figure 3: Network constraints, from appendix H of [VSC]

   The VSC-A project, relaxed some of these network constraints.  In
   particular, the security related network constraints were derived,
   see Figure 4 and [VSC-A_1609.2].  In addition to these network
   security constraints, the VSC-A uses for the traffic safety
   application Do Not Pass Warning, a Maximum required range of
   communication, of 700 meters as a target.

6.  Discussion and conclusions

   This document described a number of communication performance
   requirements that are imposed by traffic safety applications on a
   network layer.

Internet-Draft  Traffic safety applications requirements   February 2010


   These traffic safety applications and requirements
   have been derived by the USA VSC (Vehicle Safety 
   Communications)and VSC-A (VSC-Applications) projects and by the 
   European Car to Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) and the ETSI TC 
   ITS standardization body. The goal of this document is
   to stimulate the discussion on judging whether these performance
   requirements could or could not be supported (currently and in the
   future) by IP based network solutions.


   Comparing the traffic safety applications derived by European and by 
   USA projects and consortia the following conclusions can be derived:

     o the traffic safety applications and the use cases derived by 
       European and USA projects and consortia are quite identical. 

     o the performance requirements derived by European and USA projects 
       and consortia are similar. The main difference between 
       the requirements derived by European projects and consortia and 
       the ones derived by USA projects and consortia is that the 
       European derived traffic safety applications consider multi-hop 
       communication, i.e., geocasting forwarding, while the USA derived 
       ones use only single hop broadcast solutions. The multi-hop 
       communication requires geocast related forwarding mechanisms, 
       such as: geographical unicast, geographically-scoped broadcast 
       (also referred to as geo-broadcast) and geographically-scoped 
       anycast (also known as geo-anycast). The C2C-CC currently assumes 
       that IP is not suitable for safety and traffic efficiency 
       applications (too much overhead, lack of geocast forwarding
       features, etc.). There are however initiatives, like the GeoNet 
       project [GEONET] working on the design of mechanisms to integrate 
       IP on top of the C2C-CC architecture.


   It is however important to note that according to the VSC-A project
   the following points are important to be mentioned:

   1.  A general point is that the requirements of the target
       applications are intended to be somewhat representative of the
       expected requirements discussed in the VSC and VSC-A projects,
       but over time it is expected that new application ideas to come
       forward and the communication requirements may broaden as a
       result.  For example, most applications today are designed to
       treat safety messages as self-contained such that the decision to
       warn a driver can be made purely based on the contents of the
       most recent message.  In the future, we may see applications that
       require correlation of data over multiple messages from a given
       sender, or between multiple senders.




Karagiannis, et al.      Expires August 25, 2010               [Page 17]


Internet-Draft  Traffic safety applications requirements   February 2010



   2.  We now expect typical safety messages to be on the order of 300
       to 400 bytes (including all layers of overhead), rather than the
       200 bytes given as the upper limit cited in Appendix H of
       [VSC].It is expected that the security overhead will be between
       about 200 bytes and about 90 bytes, depending on whether a full
       certificate or a hashed certificate digest is included (the full
       certificate will be included at some reduced rate, probably 1 Hz
       to 3 Hz).  There is also some additional, sub-rate safety
       information to communicate the sending vehicle's path history,
       its predicted path, and some of its raw GPS data.  The latter is
       for purposes of computing precise relative positioning.
       Furthermore, it is expected that in some congested-channel
       scenarios we might expect to see more than 10 msec of network
       latency.  This is exacerbated under the current multi-channel
       operation standard (IEEE 1609.4) [IEEE 1609.4], which calls for
       time to be divided into 50 msec intervals, with switching between
       a "control channel interval" and a "service channel interval",
       and then back again.  Safety messages are only sent during the
       control channel interval.  It is possible for a given message
       that is enqueued in one control channel interval to have to wait
       for the next one if it is still in backoff when the first
       interval ends, thus incurring up to 50 more msec of latency.

       That is highly undesirable however, and in any case we're hoping
       to change the standards to avoid this channel-switching paradigm
       for safety messages.

   3.  Furthermore, the requirement on "maximum allowable latency" is
       difficult to be interpreted when the communication takes place
       over an inherently unreliable medium.  The fact is that the
       applications built on DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communications)
       will have to be somewhat robust to lost broadcast messages.  We
       often talk about the delay between successfully delivered
       messages, and it is expected that safety applications can
       generally tolerate at least 300 msec of such delay (i.e. two
       successive lost packets).


7.  Security Considerations

   As safety applications operate in dangerous situations, it is 
   generally accepted that secure operations of vehicular networks are 
   of paramount importance. Attackers must not be able to subvert 
   operation of applications, e.g. to trigger false warnings or easily 
   suppress real ones. Therefore, both US and European research 
   activities on vehicular networks have worked on security solutions 
   right from the start.




Karagiannis, et al.      Expires August 25, 2010               [Page 18]


Internet-Draft  Traffic safety applications requirements   February 2010



   IEEE 1602.2 [IEEE 1609.2] provides an early solution taking into 
   account many requirements. The European SeVeCom project [SEVECOM] has 
   also published a design for a complete security subsystem for 
   vehicular networks [SEVECOM-D2.1,SEVECOM-D2.1-APPA]. Furthermore, the  
   PRECIOSA project is focusing dedicatedly on privacy-friendly design 
   of Intelligent Transportation Systems, including vehicular networks 
   [PRECIOSA].

   Analyzing security requirements in vehicular networks, one can refer   
   to classical security goals: confidentiality, integrity, and 
   availability.

   Confidentiality: One can note that for all safety applications, 
   listed earlier, confidentiality is not a primary requirement. 
   Information contained in safety-related messages should be received 
   by all neighbors and can be considered public. So encryption of data 
   is not a primary concern. If so, one could analyze the applicability  
   of ESP headers for this purpose. However, note that there are privacy 
   requirements (see below).

   Integrity: It is of great import to ensure correctness of 
   communicated data and to prevent attackers from sending forged or 
   modified messages that could trigger application warnings or other 
   reactions. One first step suggested by above mentioned solutions is 
   to establish an identity management system that uses digital 
   certificates and signatures by which receivers can verify that 
   messages have been sent by valid vehicles. These solutions are very 
   similar to AUTH headers of IPsec, however, size limitations suggest 
   to use suitable cryptosystems like ECDSA. Restricting communication 
   to valid vehicles is not sufficient, as those vehicles could still 
   send false information (e.g. wrong position data). Additional 
   mechanisms for data-consistency checking are proposed to detect and 
   discard such information.

   Availability: protecting the vehicular network from all kind of 
   jamming and overloading attacks is important but beyond the scope of 
   this paper, as security mechanisms usually address physical and 
   datalink layer attacks. If multi-hop forwarding schemes like Geocast 
   are used, protection from Denial-of-Service attacks targeting the 
   network layer also need to be taken into consideration. Because of 
   the broadcast nature of vehicular communication, mechanisms to 
   protect e.g. from DDoS attacks in the Internet will likely be not 
   portable.

   Beyond those security requirements, it is also important to protect  
   privacy of drivers. Foremost, it should be impossible to find the 
   location of a vehicle or track its itinerary based on recorded 
   vehicular communications. Solutions generally apply pseudonymous 
   identifiers to prevent a certain degree of unlinkability. 



Karagiannis, et al.      Expires August 25, 2010               [Page 19]


Internet-Draft  Traffic safety applications requirements   February 2010


   To prevent tracking vehicles, those identifiers need to be changed 
   regularly (e.g., in each minute). This creates additional challenges 
   to communication layers that can e.g. be addressed using 
   MobileIP/NEMO technologies.

   As discussed in Section 5, vehicular networks create a very 
   challenging environment for a security system. Due to the broadcast 
   and periodic nature of communication, vehicles might have to send 
   some dozens of packets per second while at the same time receiving up 
   to a few thousand packets per second from neighboring nodes. This 
   corresponds to some dozens of signature generations per second and 
   some thousands of signature (plus certificate) verifications per 
   second. OBU hardware is not likely able to cope with this  
   cryptographic load, so usage of dedicated crypto-coprocessors is 
   likely. [SCHOCH-EFF-2010] outlines some other strategies to reduce 
   cryptographic load.

   Cryptographic payload in messages (signatures, certificates, 
   metadata) must also not overload the communication medium. Based on 
   information from [REF 1602.2] security payload will increase packet 
   size by at least 181 bytes even when using space-efficient ECDSA. 
   Assuming message sizes of 200 bytes, this almost doubles the size of 
   a message. [SCHOCH-EFF-2010] also analyzes this and proposes 
   mitigation strategies.

   Using standard IPsec techniques (ESP/AUTH headers and X.509 
   certificates) would aggravate this problem. However, work on space-
   efficient IPsec variants, e.g. from the Wireless Sensor Network 
   domain, could be considered for adoption in IP-based vehicular 
   networks.

   Overall, if one would adopt IP as a protocol for safety-related 
   messages in vehicular-networks, one would need to take into account 
   the issues raised above. This would require at least a modification 
   of IPsec plus introduction of additional security mechanisms like 
   pseudonymous identifiers and data-consistency checking. Note that for 
   communication with backend infrastructures via RSUs, IPsec can be 
   considered a mature solution to be applied.

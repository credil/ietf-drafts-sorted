          Improved DNS Server Selection for Multi-Homed Nodes
              draft-savolainen-mif-dns-server-selection-06

Abstract

   A multi-homed node can be connected to multiple networks that may
   utilize different DNS namespaces.  The node often receives DNS server
   configuration information from all connected networks.  Some of the
   DNS servers may have information about namespaces other servers do
   not have.  When the multi-homed node needs to utilize DNS, it has to
   choose which of the servers to contact to.  This document describes a
   policy based method for helping on selection of DNS server for both
   forward and reverse DNS lookup procedures with help of DNS suffix and
   IPv6 prefix information received via DHCPv6.

1.  Introduction

   A multi-homed node faces several problems over single-homed node as
   is described in [I-D.ietf-mif-problem-statement].  This document
   studies in detail the problems local namespaces may cause for multi-
   homed nodes in the IPv4 and IPv6 domains and provides a solution.
   The node may be implemented as a host, or as a router such as
   Consumer Premises Equipment.

   When multiple namespaces are visible for a node, some DNS servers
   have information other servers do not have.  Because of that, a
   multi-homed node cannot assume every DNS server is able to provide
   any piece of information, but instead the node must be able to ask
   right server for the information it needs.

   An example of an application that benefits from multi-homing is a web
   browser that commonly accesses many different destinations and should
   be able to dynamically communicate over different network interfaces.

   However, as the IPv4 is being phased out and often uses NATs to
   achieve similar functions, this document describes a solution only
   for the IPv6 domain.

   In deployments where multiple namespaces are present, selection of
   the correct destination and source addresses for the actual IP
   connection is usually crucial as well, as the resolved destination's
   IP address may be only usable on the network interface over which it
   was resolved on.  Hence solution described in this document is
   assumed to be often used in combination of tools delivering source
   and destination address selection policies.

   Node multihoming in general may introduce new attack vectors.  This
   document includes security considerations that will help against
   possible new attack vectors and also to some existing attack vectors.

   The Appendix A describes best current practices possible with tools
   preceding this document and on networks not supporting this
   specification.  As it is possible to solve the problem with less
   efficient and less explicit manners, this document can be considered
   as an optimization.  However, in some environments this optimization
   is considered essential.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Problem description for local namespaces with multi-homed nodes

   This chapter describes two host multi-homing related local namespace
   scenarios for which the procedure described in chapter 3 provides a
   solution.  Essentially the same challenges may be faced by Consumer
   Premises Equipment as is described in
   [I-D.troan-multihoming-without-nat66].

2.1.  Fully qualified domain names with limited scopes

   A multi-homed host may be connecting to one or more networks that are
   using local namespaces.  As an example, the host may have
   simultaneously open a wireless LAN (WLAN) connection to public
   Internet, cellular connection to an operator network, and a virtual
   private network (VPN) connection to a corporate network.  When an
   application initiates a connection establishment to an FQDN, the host
   needs to be able to choose the right network interface for making a
   successful DNS query.  This is illustrated in the figure 1.  An FQDN
   for a public name can be resolved with any DNS server of any network
   interface, but for an FQDN of corporation's or operator's service's
   local name the host would need to be able to correctly select the
   right network interface for the DNS resolution, i.e. do interface
   selection already before destination's IP address is known.

2.2.  Network interface specific IP addresses

   In the second problem an FQDN as such is valid and resolvable via
   different network interfaces, but to different and not necessarily
   globally reachable IP addresses, as is illustrated in the figure 2.
   This is a problem when a host is single-homed, but for multi-homed
   host this results in additional challenges: the host's source and
   destination address selection mechanism must ensure the destination's
   IP address is only used in combination with source IP addresses of
   the network interface the name was resolved on.

   Similar situation can happen when IPv6 protocol translation is used
   in combination with AAAA record synthesis proceduce
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].  A synthesised AAAA record is guaranteed to
   be valid only on a network interface it was synthesized on.  Figure 3
   illustrates a scenario where the peer's IPv4 address is synthesized
   into different IPv6 addresses by DNS servers A and B. The same
   problem can happen in the IPv4 domain as well if A record synthesis
   is done, for example as described in Bump-In-the-Stack [RFC2767].

   For a related problem for dual-stack hosts in a network with DNS64,
   where IPv4 should be prioritized over synthesized IPv6, please see
   [I-D.wing-behave-dns64-config].

   A more complex scenario is an FQDN, which in addition to resolving
   into network interface specific IP addresses, identifies on different
   network interfaces completely different peer entities with
   potentially different set of service offering.  In even more complex
   scenario, an FQDN identifies unique peer entity, but one that
   provides different services on its different network interfaces.  The
   solution described in this document is not able to tackle these
   higher layer issues.  In fact, some of the problems may be solvable
   only by user intervention.

   A thing worth noting is that interface specific IP addresses can
   cause problems also for a single-homed host, if the host retains its
   DNS cache during movement from one network interface to another.
   After the interface change a host could have both positive and
   negative DNS cache entries invalid for the new network interface.
   Because of this the cached DNS information should be considered
   network interface local instead of node global.


3.  Improved DNS server selection

   This chapter describes a procedure a (stub / proxy) resolver may
   utilize for improved DNS server selection in face of multiple
   namespaces and multiple simultaneously active network interfaces.

3.1.  Procedure for prioritizing DNS servers and handling responses

   The resolver SHALL dynamically build for each DNS query a priority
   list of DNS servers it will contact to.  To prioritize DNS servers in
   safe and optimal way, a node SHOULD ask with DHCPv6 which DNS servers
   of each network interface are most likely able to successfully serve
   forward lookup requests matching to specific DNS suffixes or reverse
   (PTR record) lookup requests matching to specific IPv6 prefixes.

   A resolver lacking more explicit information shall assume that all
   information is available from any DNS server of any network
   interface.  The DNS servers learnt by other DNS server address
   configuration methods MUST be handled as medium priority default
   servers.

   When a resource record is to be resolved, the resolver SHOULD give
   highest precedence to the DNS servers explicitly known to serve
   matching suffixes or prefixes.  However, the resolver MUST take into
   account different trust levels of pieces of DNS server selection
   information the resolver has received from node's network interfaces.
   The resolver MUST generally prefer more trusted DNS servers and less
   trusted DNS server MAY be of highest priority only if trusted
   interfaces specifically configure DNS servers with low priority.  The

Internet-Draft        MIF and DNS server selection          January 2011


   non-exhaustive list on table 1 illustrates how the different trust
   levels of received DNS server selection information MUST influence
   the DNS server selection logic.

   Information from       | Information from       | Resulting DNS
   from more trusted      | less trusted           | server priority
   interface A            | interface B            | selection
--------------------------+------------------------+--------------------
1. Medium priority        | Medium priority        | Default:  A, then B
   default                | default                |
--------------------------+------------------------+--------------------
2. Medium priority        | High priority default  | Default:  A, then B
   default                | High priority specific | Specific: A, then B
--------------------------+------------------------+--------------------
3. Low priority default   | Medium priority        | Default:  B, then A
                          | default                |
--------------------------+------------------------+--------------------
4. Low priority default   | Medium priority        | Default:  B, then A
   High priority specific | default                | Specific: A, then B
--------------------------+------------------------+--------------------

     Figure 4: DNS server selection in case of different trust levels

   The resolver SHOULD avoid sending queries to different interfaces in
   parallel as that may waste resources, sometimes significantly, and
   would also unnecessary reveal information about ongoing
   communications.  Independently of whether DNS queries are sent in
   series or parallel, replies for DNS queries MUST be waited until
   acceptable positive reply is received, all replies are received, or
   time out occurs.  Specifically, the resolver MUST NOT proceed with a
   positive reply from less trusted server that cannot be validated with
   DNSSEC if the DNS query sent to more trusted server is still pending.
   (DISCUSS: What about those DNS servers that instead of negative
   answer always return positive reply with an IP address of some
   captive portal?)

   For the scenario where an FQDN maps to same service but different IP
   addresses on different network interfaces, the source address
   selection algorithm must be able to pick a source address from the
   network interface that was used for DNS resolution.

   When local namespace are present a negative reply from a DNS server
   implies only that the particular DNS server was not able to serve the
   query.  However, it is not probable that the secondary DNS servers on
   the same network interface, on a same administrative domain, would be
   able to serve either.  Therefore, the next DNS server resolver
   contacts SHOULD be from another network interface.

   Resolver SHOULD use DNSSEC to validate all received DNS replies.  In
   the case DNSSEC validation fails the resolver MUST resend the query
   to the next preferred DNS server.

3.2.  DNS server selection option

   A DHCPv6 option described below is used to inform resolvers which DNS
   server should be contacted when initiating forward or reverse DNS
   lookup procedures.

               information. Prefixes for reverse mapping are encoded as
               defined for ip6.arpa [RFC3152].

            DHCPv6 option for explicit DNS suffix configuration

                                 Figure 5

   A node SHOULD include an OPTION_ORO option in DHCPv6 request with the
   OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT option code to inform the DHCPv6 server
   about the support for the improved DNS server selection logic.
   DHCPv6 server receiving this information MAY then choose to provision
   DNS server addresses only with OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT.

   The OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT contains one or more DNS suffixes the
   related DNS server has particular knowledge of (i.e. local
   namespaces).  The option can occur multiple times in a single DHCPv6
   message, if multiple DNS servers are to be configured.

   A resolver SHOULD prioritize between equally trusted DNS servers with
   help of the preference field.  The resolver MUST NOT prioritize less
   trusted DNS servers higher than trusted, even in the case of less
   trusted server would apprently have additional information.  In case
   all other things being equal the resolver shall make the
   prioritization decision based on its internal preferences.

   IPv6 prefixes should cover all the DNS suffixes configured in this
   option.  Prefixes should be as long as possible to avoid collision
   with information received on other option instances or with options
   received from DHCPv6 servers of other network interfaces.
   Overlapping IPv6 prefixes are interpreted so that the resolver can
   use any or all of the DNS servers for queries mathing the prefixes.

   As the DNS options of [RFC3646], the OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT option
   MUST NOT appear in any other than the following messages: Solicit,
   Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request, and Reply.

   The node SHOULD create a host specific route for the DNS server
   address.  The route must point to the interface DNS server address
   was learned on.  This is required to ensure DNS queries are sent out
   via the right interface.

   In the case of a DNS server replying negatively to a question having
   matching suffix, it will be for implementation to decide whether to
   consider that as a final response, or whether to ask also from other
   DNS servers.  The implementation decision may be based, for example,
   on deployment or trust models.

3.3.  Coexistence with RFC3646

   The OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT is designed to coexist with
   OPTION_DNS_SERVERS defined in [RFC3646].  The DNS servers configured

Internet-Draft        MIF and DNS server selection          January 2011


   via OPTION_DNS_SERVERS MUST BE considered as default name servers
   with medium preference.  When both options are received from the same
   network interface and the OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT contains default
   DNS server address, the resolver SHOULD make decision which one to
   prefer based on preferences.  If OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT defines
   medium preference then DNS server selection decision is
   implementation specific.  All default servers are assumed to be able
   to resolve queries for global names.

   If both OPTION_DNS_SERVERS and OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT contain the
   same DNS server(s) IPv6 address(es), only one instance of each DNS
   servers' IPv6 addresses shall be added to the DNS server list.

   If a node had indicated support for OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT in
   DHCPv6 request, the DHCPv6 server may choose to omit sending of
   OPTION_DNS_SERVERS.  This enables offloading use case where network
   administrator wishes to only advertise low priority default DNS
   servers.


4.  Example of a node behavior

   Figure 5 illustrates node behavior when it initializes two network
   interfaces for parallel usage and learns DNS suffix and prefix
   information from DHCPv6 servers.

                                 Figure 7

   Flow explanations:

   1.  An application makes a request for resolving an FQDN, e.g.
       'private.example.com'

   2.  A node creates list of DNS servers to contact to and uses
       configured DNS server information and stored DNS suffix
       information on priorization decisions.

   3.  The node has chosen interface 2, as from DHCPv6 it was learned
       earlier that the interface 2 has DNS suffix 'example.com'.  The
       node then resolves the requested name using interface 2's DNS
       server to an IPv6 address

   4.  The node replies to application with the resolved IPv6 address

5.  Scalability considerations

   The size limitations of DHCPv6 messages limit the number of suffixes
   and prefixes that can be carried in a configuration option.
   Including the suffixes and prefixes in a DHCPv6 option is best suited
   for deployments where relatively few carefully selected suffixes and
   prefixes are adequate.


6.  Considerations for network administrators

   Network administrators deploying private namespaces should assist
   advanced hosts in the DNS server selection by providing information
   described in this memo for nodes.  To ensure nodes' source and
   destination IP address selection also works correctly, network
   administrators should also deploy related technologies for that
   purpose.

   The solution described herein is best for selecting a DNS server
   having knowledge of some namespaces.  The solution is not able to
   make the right decision in a scenario where same name points to
   different services on different network interfaces.  Network
   administrators are recommended to avoid overloading of namespaces in
   such manner.

   To mitigate against attacks against local namespaces, administrators
   utilizing this tool should deploy DNSSEC for their zone.

9.  Security Considerations

   It is possible that attackers might try to utilize
   OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT option to redirect some or all DNS queries
   sent by a resolver to undesired destinations.  The purpose of an
   attack might be denial-of-service, preparation for man-in-the-middle
   attack, or something akin.

   Attackers might try to lure specific traffic by advertising DNS
   suffixes and prefixes from very small to very large scope or simply
   by trying to place attacker's DNS server as the highest priority
   default server.

   The main countermeasure against these attacks is to systematically
   prioritize more trusted DNS servers higher than less trusted ones.
   Additionally, resolvers should implement DNSSEC to be able to
   validate DNS responses received via any of its interfaces.

   Decision on trust levels of network interfaces depends very much on
   deployment scenario and types of network interfaces.  For example,
   unmanaged WLAN may be considered less trustworthy than managed
   cellular or VPN connections.

   A node MAY also choose, or be configured, to obtain DNS server
   selection rules only from selected trusted interfaces, in which case
   it would be in the hands of administrators of these trusted
   interfaces whether or not to allow redirection, offloading, of DNS
   queries to untrusted interfaces (case 4 of table 1).

Appendix A.  Best Current Practice for DNS server selection

   On some split-DNS deployments explicit policies for DNS server

   selection are not available.  This section describes ways for hosts
   to mitigate the problem by sending wide-spread queries and by
   utilizing possibly existing indirect information elements as hints.

A.1.  Sending queries out on multiple interfaces in parallel

   A possible current practice is to send DNS queries out of multiple
   interfaces and pick up the best out of the received responses.  A
   host SHOULD implement DNSSEC in order to be able to reject responses
   that cannot be validated.  Selection between legitimate answers is
   implementation specific, but positive replies should be preferred.

   A downside of this approach is increased consumption of resources.
   Namely power consumption if an interface, e.g. wireless, has to be
   brought up just for the DNS query that could have been resolved also
   via cheaper interface.  Also load on DNS servers is increased.
   However, local caching of results mitigates these problems, and a
   node might also learn interfaces that seem to be able to provide more
   responses than other and prefer those - without forgetting fallback
   required for cases when node is connected to more than one network
   using local namespaces.

   Another downside is revealing to all DNS servers the names a host is
   connecting to.  For example, a DNS server of public hotspot could
   learn all the private names host is trying to connect on other
   interfaces.

A.2.  Search list option for DNS forward lookup decisions

   A host can learn the special DNS suffixes of attached network
   interfaces from DHCP search list options; DHCPv4 Domain Search Option
   number 119 [RFC3397] and DHCPv6 Domain Search List Option number 24
   [RFC3646].  The host behavior is very similar as is illustrated in
   the example at section 3.3.  While these DHCP options are not
   intented to be used in DNS server selection, they may be used by the
   host for smart DNS server prioritization purposes in order to
   increase likelyhood of fast and successful DNS query.

   Overloading of existing DNS search list options is not without
   problems: resolvers would obviously use the DNS suffixes learned from
   search lists also for name resolution purposes.  This may not be a
   problem in deployments where DNS search list options contain few DNS
   suffixes like 'example.com, private.example.com', but can become a
   problem if many suffixes are configured.

Internet-Draft        MIF and DNS server selection          January 2011


A.3.  More specific routes for reverse lookup decision

   [RFC4191] defines how more specific routes can be provisioned for
   hosts.  This information is not intented to be used in DNS server
   selection, but nevertheless a host can use this information as a hint
   about which interface would be best to try first for reverse lookup
   procedures.  A DNS server configured via the same interface as more
   specific routes is likely more capable to answer reverse lookup
   questions than DNS server of an another interface.  The likelyhood of
   success is possibly higher if DNS server address is received in the
   same RA [RFC5006] as the more specific route information.

A.4.  Longest matching prefix for reverse lookup decision

   A host may utilize the longest matching prefix approach when deciding
   which DNS server to contact for reverse lookup purposes.  Namely, the
   host may send a DNS query to a DNS server learned over an interface
   having longest matching prefix to the address being queried.  This
   approach can help in cases where ULA [RFC4193] addresses are used and
   when the queried address belongs to a host or server within the same
   network (for example intranet).

               DNS Server Selection on Multi-Homed Hosts
              draft-savolainen-mif-dns-server-selection-02

Abstract

   A multi-homed host may receive DNS server configuration information
   from multiple physical and/or virtual network interfaces.  In split
   DNS scenarios not all DNS servers are able to provide the same
   information.  When the multi-homed host needs to utilize DNS, it has
   to select which of the servers to contact to.  This document
   describes problems of split DNS for multi-homed hosts and also a
   method for selecting the DNS server with help of DNS suffix
   information received dynamically for each network interface.  The
   method is useful in split DNS scenarios where private names are used
   and where correct DNS server selection is mandatory for successful
   DNS resolution.

1.  Introduction

   A multi-homed host faces several problems over single-homed host as
   described in [I-D.ietf-mif-problem-statement].  This document studies
   in detail problems split DNS may cause for multi-homed hosts and for
   which optimized behaviour should be defined.  The problems are mostly
   the same in IPv4 and IPv6 domains.

   In the split DNS scenario different DNS servers have different
   information.  Therefore DNS related information, which otherwise
   could be consider global for a single-homed host, in a multi-homed
   host has to be handled as local to a network interface.  DNS record
   synthesis, as described in DNS64 [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] and Bump-In-
   the-Stack [RFC2767], can be consider as one manifestation of split
   DNS.

   An obvious solution for the problem would be for network
   administrators to cease utilizing any form of split DNS, or have
   split DNS used only in deployments where hosts are not allowed to
   multi-home.  However, currently split DNS is deployed and multi-homed
   hosts have to cope with that.

   If an application is bound to utilize only a specific network
   interface at a time, it essentially makes the host behave single-
   interface way for that particular application and avoids the problems
   of split DNS, if also application's DNS requests are handled strictly
   with DNS service available in that particular network interface.  If
   all applications in a host are bound to use only single network
   interface at a time, even if the used network interfaces were
   different, the problems are generally avoided.  Please see MIF
   current practices [I-D.ietf-mif-current-practices] for more
   information.  The procedure described in chapter 3 applies when
   applications are allowed to utilize multiple interfaces in parallel.

   An example of an application that would benefit from multi-homing is
   a web browser, which commonly accesses many different destinations
   and should be able to dynamically communicate over different network
   interfaces.

   The solution presented in this memo is intended to be fully backwards
   compatible and one that can be fully ignored by hosts and networks
   that are not experiencing the described problem scenarios or that
   does not implement the solution.

   In deployments where split DNS is used, selection of the correct
   destination and source addresses for the actual IP connection is
   crucial, as the resolved destination's IP address may be only usable
   on the network interface over which it was resolved on.  However, the

   actual IP address selection logic is not at the scope of this
   document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Problem description for split DNS with multi-homed hosts

   This chapter describes two multi-homing related split DNS problem
   scenarios for which the procedure described in chapter 3 is targeted
   at.  (DISCUSS: Even more more known problem scenarios caused by split
   DNS for multi-homed hosts?)

2.1.  Private fully qualified domain names

   A multi-homed host may be connecting to one or more networks that are
   using private fully qualified domain names.  As an example, the host
   may have simultaneously open a wireless LAN (WLAN) connection to open
   Internet, cellular connection to an operator network, and virtual
   private network (VPN) connection to a corporate network.  When an
   application initiates connection to an FQDN, the host needs to be
   able to choose the right network interface for making successful DNS
   query.  This is illustrated in figure 1.  If the FQDN is for a public
   name, in figure 1 scenario it could be resolved with any DNS server
   of any network interface, but if the FQDN would be corporation's or
   operator's service's private name, the host would need to be able to
   correctly select the right network interface for DNS procedures, i.e.
   already before destination's IP address is known.

2.2.  Network interface specific IP addresses

   In the second problem an FQDN as such is valid and resolvable via
   different network interfaces, but to different and not necessarily
   globally reachable IP addresses, as illustrated in figure 2.  This is
   not so much a problem when a host is single-homed, but for multi-
   homed host this results in additional challenges: the host's source
   and destination address selection mechanism must ensure the
   destination's IP address is only used in combination with source IP
   addresses of the network interface the name was resolved on.

   Similar situation can happen when IPv6 protocol translation is used
   in combination with AAAA record synthesis proceduce
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].  A synthesised AAAA record is guaranteed to
   be valid only on a network interface it was synthesized on.  Figure 3
   illustrates a scenario where the peer's IPv4 address is synthesized
   into different IPv6 addresses by DNS servers A and B. The same
   problem can happen in the IPv4 domain as well if A record synthesis
   is done, for example as described in Bump-In-the-Stack [RFC2767].

   For a related problem for dual-stack hosts in a network with DNS64,
   where IPv4 should be prioritized over synthesized IPv6, please see

   More complex scenario is an FQDN, which in addition to resolving into
   network interface specific IP addresses, identifies on different
   network interfaces completely different peer entities with
   potentially different set of service offering.  In even more complex
   scenario, an FQDN identifies unique peer entity, but one that
   provides different services on its different network interfaces.  The
   solution described in this document is not able to tackle these
   higher layer issues.

   A thing worth noting is that interface specific IP addresses can
   cause problems also for a single-homed host, if the host retains its
   DNS cache during movement from one network interface to another, and
   thus on the new network interface host has cache entries invalid for
   that network interface.  Because of this the cached DNS information
   should be considered network interface local instead of node global.


3.  DNS server selection procedure

   This chapter documents a possible procedure a host may utilize for
   DNS server selection on multi-homing scenarios.

   Essentially, the host shall build dynamically for each DNS query a
   list of DNS servers it will try to contact to.  The host shall cycle
   through the list until a positive reply is received, or until all
   selected DNS servers have been contacted or timed out.  (DISCUSS:
   What about those DNS servers that instead of negative answer always
   return positive reply with an IP address of some default HTTP server,
   which purpose is just to say 'page not found'?)

   When building the list, the host shall prioritize DNS servers in a
   optimal way for the query at hand.  Host can utilize any information
   it may have, e.g. possible user's preferences, host's general
   preferences between network interfaces, differences on trust levels
   of network interfaces (see Security Considerations), DNS suffix
   information possibly available, or any other piece of information.

   For the scenario where an FQDN maps to same service but different IP
   addresses on different network interfaces, the source address
   selection algorithm must be able to pick a source address from the
   network interface that was used for DNS resolution.

   In private FQDN deployments a negative reply from a DNS server
   implies only that the DNS server at hand is not able to serve the
   query.  However, it is not probable that the secondary DNS servers on
   the same network interface would be able to serve either, due likely
   being in the same administrative domain.  Therefore the next DNS
   server host contacts should be from another network interface.

Internet-Draft        MIF and DNS server selection         February 2010


   A host may optimize its behaviour by sending DNS requests in parallel
   to multiple DNS servers of different network interfaces, but this
   approach is not always practical:

   o  It may unnecessary trigger activation of a radio and thus increase
      battery consumption.

   o  It may unnecessarily reveal private names to outsiders.

   o  It may be a privacy issue as it would reveal all names host is
      resolving to all DNS servers.

3.1.  DNS suffixes as hints

   To help prioritize DNS servers in an optimal way, a host may learn
   which DNS servers are most likely able to successfully serve requests
   related to specific DNS suffixes.

   By default, a host should assume all information is available via all
   DNS servers of any network interface.

   When a resource record is to be resolved, a host shall give highest
   precedence to the DNS servers explicitly known to serve matching
   suffixes and then to the DNS servers of the network interface(s)
   advertising corresponding DNS suffix.

   For example, when a resolution of an FQDN has been requested and the
   host is prioritizing DNS servers of different network interfaces, the
   host may prioritize higher DNS server(s) of the network interface(s)
   with matching DNS suffix than it otherwise would have.

3.1.1.  Learning of the DNS suffixes on existing networks

   A host can learn the DNS suffixes of attached network interfaces from
   DHCP search list options; DHCPv4 Domain Search Option number 119
   [RFC3397] and DHCPv6 Domain Search List Option number 24 [RFC3646].
   This is illustrated in example figure 4 below.

   To avoid overloading of existing DHCP(v6) options, new DHCP(v6)

   names matching configured DNS suffixes.  Below is description of the

   option-code:   OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT (TBD)

   option-len:    Lenght of the option in octets

   DNS-recursive-name-server: An IPv6 address of a DNS server

   DNS suffixes:  The list of DNS suffixes MUST be encoded as
                  specified in section "Representation and use of
                  domain names" of <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.

            DHCPv6 option for explicit DNS suffix configuration

                                 Figure 5

   The OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT contains one or more DNS suffixes the
   related DNS server has particular knowledge of (e.g. private
   suffixes).  The option can occur multiple times in a single DHCPv6
   message, if multiple DNS servers are to be configured.

   As the DNS options of [RFC3646], the OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT option
   MUST NOT appear in any other than the following messages: Solicit,
   Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request, and Reply.

   Due backwards compatibility, the DHCPv6 message containing
   OPTION_DNS_SERVER_SELECT also very likely contains
   OPTION_DNS_SERVERS.  In case both options contain same IPv6
   addresses, only one copy of the IPv6 address SHALL be added to the
   DNS server list.

   In the case of a DNS server replying negatively to a question having
   matching suffix, it will be for implementation to decide whether to
   consider that as authoritative response, or whether to ask also from
   other DNS servers.  The implementation decision may be based, for
   example, on deployment or trust models.

3.1.3.  Changes to DNS resolution procedures

   When a DNS resolver in a host is requested by an application to do
   DNS resolution for an FQDN to an IP address, the host should look if
   any of the configured DNS servers are known to serve addresses for
   particular suffixes, or if any of the available network interfaces
   are known to advertise DNS suffixes matching to the FQDN.  If there
   is a match, then explicitly configured DNS server(s) or DNS server(s)
   of the particular interface should be priorized higher, i.e. be used
   for name resolution procedures.  This is illustrated in figure 6
   below.  To avoid accidental use of synthesized IPv6 addresses in the
   dual-stack case, a host may prioritize DNS servers' IPv4 addresses
   over IPv6 addresses.


    Application     Host     DHCP server of     DHCP server of
                             interface 1        interface 2

                  Choosing interface based on DNS suffix

   Flow explanations:

   1.  An application makes a request for resolving an FQDN, e.g.
       'private.example.com'

   2.  A host creates list of DNS servers to contact to and uses
       configured DNS server information and stored DNS suffix
       information on priorization decisions.

   3.  The host has chosen interface 2, as from DHCP it was learned
       earlier that the interface 2 has DNS suffix 'example.com'.  The
       host then resolves the requested name using interface 2's DNS
       server to IP 192.0.2.1

   4.  The host replies to application with resolved IP address
       192.0.2.1


4.  Considerations for network administrators

   Due to the problems caused by split DNS for multi-homed hosts,
   network administrators should consider carefully deployment of split
   DNS.

   Network administrators deploying split DNS should assist hosts in DNS
   server selection by configuring their DHCP servers with proper DNS
   suffix information, which hosts then can use as hints.  To ensure
   hosts' source and destination IP address selection works correctly,
   network administrators should also consider deployment of additional
   technologies to help with that.

   Network administrators can continue using DHCP DNS search list
   options as before, but administrators should take into account that
   multi-homed hosts may choose to use the DNS suffix information also
   for DNS server selection purposes.


5.  Further considerations

   Overloading of existing DNS search list options is not without
   problems, though: hosts would obviously use the DNS suffixes learned
   from search lists also for name resolution purposes.  This may not be
   a problem in deployments where DNS search list options contain few
   DNS suffixes like 'example.com, private.example.com', but can become
   a problem if many suffixes are configured.  To avoid overloading of
   existing options, this document proposes standardization of a
   completely new DHCP option.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may try to lure traffic from multi-homed host to his
   network by advertising DNS suffixes attacker wishes to intercept or
   deny service of.  The host's security should not be based on correct
   functionality of DNS server selection, but nevertheless risks of this
   attack can be mitigated by using DNSSEC and additionally properly
   prioritizing network interfaces with conflicting DNS suffix
   advertisements.  The prioritization could be based on trust level of
   a network interface over which DNS suffix was learned from, like for
   example:

   1.  Managed tunnel interfaces (such as VPN) considered most
       trustworthy

   2.  Managed networks being on the middle

   3.  Unmanaged networks having lowest priority

   Now, for example, if all of the three abovementioned networks would
   advertise 'corporation.com' DNS suffix, the host would prefer the VPN
   network interface for related DNS resolution requests.

Internet-Draft        Secured LSP Problem Statement         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   VPNs implemented using MPLS gain the advantage of simplified
   switching, and communication segregation, but do not typically gain
   encryption and authentication.  While procedures exist which define
   encryption for sub-IP transport, these are not typically able to use
   the standard key exchange protocols.

   Issues which would impact specification of carriage and secured
   encapsulation of data over MPLS networks are discussed in this
   document.


2.  Applicability

   Use of IPSec based protocols for non-IP environments precludes use of
   IP Authentication Header (AH) for protection of the data payload
   [RFC4302].  This is because AH performs authenticity calculations
   across an IP Pseudo Header containing the IP Source and Destination
   addresses from the exterior IPv4 or IPv6 packet.

   Authenticity operations for carriage in MPLS environments may be
   performed instead by using the Encapsulating Security Payload, which
   also allows payload encryption [RFC4303].

   At this stage, while data plane communications are intended not to
   require IP packet encapsulation, communications for initial key
   exchange and peer-to-peer Label signalling may require IP addressing
   in the control plane.  Considerations for ssytems without IP
   addressing on the control plane are out-of-scope for this document.


3.  Comparable Technologies

   Provision of secured transport at sub-IP layers has been specified
   using IP or GRE for transport of MPLS Labels [RFC4023], but this
   specification requires carriage of MPLS Labels over IP.  To allow
   Label switched transport and traffic engineering, this requires
   insertion of IP and ESP or AH headers between the two stacked labels
   [RFC3209].

   802.1AE provides an encryption mechanism for Link-Layer
   communications in IEEE LAN/MAN environments [DOT1AE].  The initial
   specification does not contain key derivation mechanisms, although
   these are being specified in revisions to the 802.1X specification
   [DOT1XREV].

   PWsec is a specification of security for pseudo-wires between

   attachment circuits, making use of modern encryption and
   authentication algorithms, without specification of a key derivation
   and algorithm extensible packet format [PWSEC][PWSECREQ].

   In comparison with the above three technologies, the mechanism
   discussed here aims to require no data plane IP Headers before the
   carried payload.  It also intends to make use of Internet Key
   Exchange (IKEv2) rather than IEEE key derivation protocols, and uses
   existing pseudo-wire transport secured over Encapsulating Security
   Payload [RFC4448][RFC4303].


4.  Existing deployment models

   Several different security association models may be applicable,
   depending on the MPLS VPN architecture.  It remains to be determined
   which of these should be supported, and which should be explicitly
   signalled (for example with Route Descriptors for VRF aware
   associations.

                        Common Security Association

   Using a common ESP Security association between PE pairs, a secured
   LSP can be provided for all communications with the same Forwarding
   Equivalence Class.  By using IPSec traffic selectors that reflect
   Label semantics, it is possible to provide VPN/VRF associated inner
   label encapsulation for each customer over the same SA.

   signalling as well, although this is not explicitly investigated.

Internet-Draft        Secured LSP Problem Statement         October 2009


   With in a specific Label switched path, it may be necessary to
   maintain a particular label mapping solely for encapsulating ESP
   payloads.  This would allow communications to be VRF aware,
   presenting Traffic multiplexed based on its security parameters
   index.

   Similarly with previous scenarios, the ESP SA may itself encapsulate
   MPLS Labels, or pseudo-wires [I-D.daley-mpsec-label-ts].


5.  Operations

   Five primary operations occur specific to life span of a secured LSP.
   These are outlined below.

5.1.  Secure Label Switch Path Request

   In order to set up a secured Label switch path, it is necessary to
   perform PE to PE signalling, which requests binding of an LSP to a
   future security association.

   It is expected that no Provider routers other than participating PE
   routers will require knowledge of the secured LSP.  As such, while a
   VPN route may exist between PE devices, requests for secured LSP
   signalling are performed using Targetted LDP signalling [RFC3036].

   Where the Secured Label switch path is associated with a Virtual
   Routing Function, this requires that the Tunnelled LSP is established
   using a targetted LDP request with information elements representing
   the tunnel Label.

   For environments where no inner tunnel is constructed, and encryption
   is required over the base label, the targetted LDP may specify an
   implicit-NULL in label request signalling.  This would have the
   effect of running the IPSec packets directly over the exterior LSP.
   This creates challenges for service multiplexing though, so a single
   LSP would need to be dedicated to SA Multiplexing.

   Finally, it may be valuable for the LDP session itself to be
   protected using IPSec protocols.

5.2.  IKEv2 Negotiation of Security Associations

   Negotiation of the Security Association Parameters makes use of
   IKEv2, and at this stage requires the implementation to be able to
   infer from the Targetted LDP and IKE exchange, where Encapsulating
   Security Payload packets should be encapsulated onto and decapsulated
   from.

Internet-Draft        Secured LSP Problem Statement         October 2009


5.3.  Encapsulating packets at Provider Edge

   Encapsulation of packets over a secured LSP at the Provider Edge
   relies upon the correct construction of the Security Association Data
   Base (SADB), and the ability to forward transported packet payloads
   onto Tunnel pseudo interfaces or apply security transformations on
   packets.

5.4.  Decapsulating packets at Provider Edge

   Decapsulation of packets at the provider edge requires the same
   checks as is typical for an ESP SA.  Upon decapsulation of the
   contents at the provider edge, packet forwarding depends on the
   function of the upper-layer protocol, as in any other MPLS operation.

   Since it is not possible to strip the ESP encapsulation on the prior
   hop though using penultimate hop popping, it may be necessary to
   perform two operations, the decryption associated with the ESP header
   removal, and the end forwarding instance's task.

5.5.  Session Tear-Down

   Unlike typical LDP operations, sending a Shutdown message is not
   sufficient to remove a secured LSP, unless the LDP exchange itself
   was protected via IPSec.  Local tear-down procedures will affect the
   IKE session though, which will identify that the session is
   terminating via a DELETE Exchange.


6.  IKEv2 Considerations

   MPLS labels typically can contain one of many upper layer protocol
   elements, including IPv4 or IPv6 headers, Further stacked labels, or
   Pseudo-wires [RFC4798][I-D.daley-mpsec-label-ts].  It is envisioned
   that in order to support secured versions of MPLS LSPs, IKEv2 traffic
   selectors will have to be constructed for all of the above elements.


7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are currently described in thsi document.


8.  Security Considerations

   Identities based on IP Addressing are not necessarily valid when
   applied in Sub-IP networks, such as MPLS.  As such, identifiers of
   the form ID_IPV4_ADDR, ID_IPV6_ADDR may not be consequently validated

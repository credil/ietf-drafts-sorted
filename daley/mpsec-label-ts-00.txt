Internet-Draft        IKEv2 Label Traffic Selectors         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Carrying MPLS Label payloads in IPsec requires a mapping between the
   ingress interface and Label carriage which is typically determined by
   a label distribution protocol.  While this is the case, it is
   important to specify the label to IPSec Security Association mappings
   especially where data encapsulated by one label requires different
   protection to that encapsulated by another.

   One IETF Standards Track RFC currently specifies carriage of MPLS
   Labels in ESP or AH payloads [RFC4023].  The specification for
   "Encapsulating MPLS in IP or GRE" [RFC4023] identifies that labels
   are to be carried in Transport Mode by specifiying the source and
   destination addresses as well as the protocol field being set to 137
   with IKEv1 or IKEv2 [RFC2409][RFC4306].  It does not specify which
   labels receive protection by an SA.

   At this stage, additional specification of label header fields is not
   feasible with IKEv1, but IKEv2 allows specification of new traffic
   selector types.  This document specifies a new format for traffic
   selectors in IKEv2, to be used in conjunction with existing uses of
   MPLS and IPSec.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Traffic Selector Format

   In order to allow for efficient expression of decorrelated selectors,
   each element from the MPLS Label are expressed in the traffic
   selector as ranges [RFC3032][RFC5462].

   Each of these values parameters may be expressed as a single value, a
   range, or the symbolic values ANY or OPAQUE, as specified in
   [RFC4301].

   The traffic selector format follows the IKE version 2 specification,
   and is presented below:

                          Label Traffic Selector

   The TS Type for this traffic selector is TBD.  The Selector Length is
   12.  TS Type specific fields are detailed below.

   Start Label, End Label:  The selected Label range is specified by the
      Start and End Label fields.

      Size :  20 bits

      MINIMUM:  0

      MAXIMUM:  1048575

      ANY    :  Start Label=0, End Label=1048575

      OPAQUE :  Start Label=1048575, End Label=0

   St TC, EndTC:  The selected Quality of Service Traffic class is
      specified by the St TC (Start Traffic Class) and EndTC (End
      Traffic Class) fields.

      Size :  3 bits

      MINIMUM:  0

      MAXIMUM:  7

      ANY    :  St TC=0, EndTC=7

      OPAQUE :  St TC=7, End TC=0

   S, T:  The selected Top of Stack identified is specified by the 'S'
      (Start Top of Stack) and 'T' (End Top of Stack) fields.

Internet-Draft        IKEv2 Label Traffic Selectors         October 2009


      Size :  1 bit

      MINIMUM:  0

      MAXIMUM:  1

      ANY    :  S=0, T=1

      OPAQUE :  S=1, T=0

   Start TTL, End TTL:  The selected Time-To-Live values for the next
      MPLS Label are specifies in the Start TTL and End TTL fields.

      Size :  8 bits

      MINIMUM:  0

      MAXIMUM:  255

      ANY    :  Start TTL=0, End TTL=255

      OPAQUE :  Start TTL=255, End TTL=0

   Behaviour of the ANY and OPAQUE Values as specified here operate as
   specified in [RFC4301].  When specifying a traffic selector, all sub
   fields (except Reserved) must be specifically set.  For fields where
   the value doesn't matter, the pair of fields should be set to specify
   ANY.

   Where a packet is to be transmitted or recived upon an SA derived
   from traffic selection using this TS Type, the encapsulated Label's
   fields MUST match the accepted policy as specified in the IKEv2
   negotiation.  Packets which do not match specification MUST be
   discarded in accordance with [RFC4301].

   Where multiple fields (for example Label Value and Traffic Class),
   are set as specified ranges, the recipient MUST check that both
   constraints are met by incoming labels.


3.  Security Policy Database Considerations

   In order to express the Label which is required for protection, it
   may be necessary to augment Security Policy Database elements.  This
   would allow initiation of negotiation of an SA upon reception of an
   interesting packet, or upon reception of a Label signalling message
   that specified a label matching the policy.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes a new traffic selector payload for IKEv2 and
   its use.

   Traffic selectors are defined by IANA Expert Review.  This document
   will be submitted for expert review and selector allocation upon a
   subsequent draft submission.

   Until submission implementations should use one of the Private Use
   selectors.  The suggested value is 250.  Please note that
   implementations would have to update to a new value when allocated
   under IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   The traffic selector format defined in this document omits the source
   and destination IP addresses, which are used within ingress packet
   checks within IPSec.  This is less expressive than in traditional
   IPSec.

   This is probably acceptable for the following reasons:

   o  Source and Destination IP addresses may be inferred from the Key
      Exchange conversation itself.

   o  Label exchanges are typically performed by another protocol which
      itself presents the endpoint IP addresses.

   As previously described [RFC4023], external MPLS Label exchange
   mechanisms MUST use authentication mechanisms.  For targetted Label
   Distribution Protocol, it is suggested that SAs are established using
   IKE to protect the LDP signalling (on TCP and UDP port 646)
   [RFC5036].

1. Introduction

   In Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) the behavior of nodes is
   determined by a network design assuming the lack of both - a pre-
   defined infrastructure and a central network administration. This is
   accompanied by a relatively high dynamicity and node mobility.

   Rapidly changing topology and node mobility put a demand on address
   auto-configuration in MANETs, where configuration needs to be kept
   even when the network is changing. Thus it is especially important
   in IPv6-based MANETs to verify the uniqueness of the addresses used
   by each node, since possible duplication may cause network protocols
   to misbehave. In particular verification of address uniqueness is
   also a core element of stateless address auto-configuration.

   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure is proposed for IPv6
   networks as a way of verifying the uniqueness of node's addresses.
   In basic IPv6 solutions ([RFC4861],[RFC4862]) it is performed only
   in the one-hope neighborhood of each node, since it was originally
   proposed for fixed networks. However changing topology and node
   mobility put a demand on DAD in MANETs, which should span across a
   wider range of nodes. Verification of the uniqueness of addresses in
   this case must be performed efficiently and the protocol message
   overhead should be minimized.

   In this document the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol [RFC4861]
   extension, denoted as ND++, is proposed, which is designed to
   address the needs of MANET networks. The extension enables Neighbor
   Discovery protocol to verify the uniqueness of an address in the
   range of several hops (enhanced DAD). It incorporates Multipoint
   Relay (MPR) concept originally proposed for OLSR routing protocol in

   [RFC3626], which provides means for efficient flooding of multihop
   protocol messages. As a result ND++ comes up with an efficient
   support for stateless address auto-configuration (SAA) in IPv6-based
   MANET networks.



2. Remarks and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   Whenever "address" is mentioned in this document, it is an IPv6
   address assigned to one of node's interfaces.

   This document uses the following terminology, which is mostly
   derived from [RFC3626] and [RFC4861]:

     node

         a device that implements IPv6, can be either a router or a
         host

     router

         a node that forwards IP packets not explicitly addressed to
         itself

     host

         any node that is not a router

     neighbours

         nodes attached to the same link, a node x is a neighbour node
         of node y if node y can hear node x

     2-hop neighbour

         a node heard by a neighbour; a node attached on the same link
         with a neighbour

     strict 2-hop neighbour

         x, provided that the message is not a duplicate, and that the
         hop limit field of the message is greater than one and
         different from 255

3. Protocol extension overview

3.1. Extended DAD

   The proposed ND++ extension is designed to implement the mechanism
   of enhanced DAD (DAD++) performed in n-hop range. It aims to verify
   the uniqueness of the node's address in the range of n hops. The
   DAD++ procedure is performed in two stages: at first in the 1-hop
   neighborhood (referred to as DAD) and second in the range of n hops
   covering possibly whole MANET domain (referred to as n-DAD). The
   whole duplicate address detection process is thus denoted as DAD++.
   This two-stage approach enables to introduce improved flooding of
   multihop ND++ messages by means of the MPR concept, which requires
   valid node identifiers at least in a range of 1 hop.

   In the DAD++ procedure a node first starts 1-hop DAD by sending 1-
   hop Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message to all its neighbors, as
   defined in basic ND protocol [RFC4861]. If the recipient of the
   message detects that the target address listed in NS message is
   equal to one of its valid addresses, it sends the notification -
   Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message, to let the sender know that it
   cannot use the requested address. If at this stage duplication was
   not found, the node can start preparation for n-DAD. At this stage
   it chooses from its 1-hop neighborhood nodes willing to forward
   packets on its behalf - the MPRs. Only MPRs will be allowed to
   forward packets, so this way flooding of ND++ protocol multihop
   messages is optimized. To complete DAD++, the node starts to send
   multihop NS messages that will be forwarded by MPRs. These messages

Internet-Draft          Neighbor Discovery ++                March 2011


   have wider range and can be used to verify the uniqueness of the
   address within the range of n hops. If there is any node within this
   range, that has the same address as the one specified as a target
   address, it will reply with multihop NA message to inform the sender
   about duplication. All multicast messages are propagated by means of
   MPRs. They follow the same procedures as 1-hop NS and NA messages,
   but can be forwarded. Detailed description of the ND++ protocol
   functionality is given in the remaining part of this document.

   MPR-related procedures are derived from [RFC3626]. In this approach
   each node in a network recognizes its one hope neighborhood. From
   this 1-hop neighborhood it chooses particular nodes (denoted as
   MPRs) willing to forward packets on its behalf. MPRs are chosen in
   such a way that they ensure that all strict 2-hop neighbors will
   receive the forwarded message with minimum overhead. The MPR
   selection algorithm is defined in [RFC3626] and is used in the ND++
   extension. The messages used to gather information necessary for
   choosing MPRs are exchanged as newly proposed options to ND++
   protocol messages. The proposed ND++ options: MPR Parameters Option,
   MPR Announcement Option and Topology and Link Control Info Option
   are incorporating some concepts introduced in [RFC3626] into the ND
   protocol. Their internal structure is based on the message types
   proposed for OLSR protocol.

   The proposed solution exploits the design paradigms of IPv6 protocol
   stack. It incorporates into ND protocol new sub-types of messages
   with multi-hop capabilities and new option types supporting MPR
   processes. The proposed protocol exploits also new option proposed
   as a Hop-by-hop Extension Header option, which is carried in the
   IPv6 packet header. Since the ND++ is an extension to basic ND
   (specified in [RFC4861]), the core functionality of ND remains
   unchanged and must be supported in order to ensure proper
   interactions with nodes that do not support ND++ implementation. The
   IPv6 design is flexible and therefore enables such coexistence. Thus
   the extension is backward compatible.

   In the ND++ extension two main types of Neighbor Solicitation (NS)
   and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages are envisioned:

   o  1-hop NS and NA messages having link-local scope, not being
      forwarded - similar to the one proposed in basic ND protocol

   o  Multi-hop NS and NA messages used to recognize node's further
      neighborhood and perform Duplicate Address Detection in n-hop
      range (n-DAD) - new message sub-types proposed for ND++

Internet-Draft          Neighbor Discovery ++                March 2011


   In order to realize the DAD++ functionality, new options are
   introduced to enable MPR selection and the usage of MPRs throughout
   the process:

   o  MPR Parameters option - used by each node in a network  to
      advertise its forwarding capabilities - it specifies willingness
      of a node to act as an MPR for other nodes and lists node
      neighbors along with the information about their type and the
      type of link to them.  The option is based on the functionality
      and message structure from OLSR routing protocol [RFC3626]

   o  MPR Announcement option - proposed for announcing which nodes
      have been chosen to act as an MPR for a certain MPR selector
      (message originator)

   o  Random ID Option attached to Hop-by-hop  Extension Header
      (included in the IPv6 packet header) - enables to distinguish
      copies of own messages and is essential in MANET networks




   DAD++ being incorporated with the ND++ protocol is able to verify
   the uniqueness of the node's address in the n-hop range. The
   procedure is performed also on the link-local addresses (valid in
   link-local scope). This helps to keep proper network configuration
   in the situations of node mobility. In such a case however, some
   address auto-configuration procedure should follow DAD++, to obtain
   routable address. For example an address having a site-local scope
   should be generated by means of a prefix distributed within auto-
   configuration procedures. This procedure is out of the scope of this
   document.



3.2. Additional functionality:

   The proposed ND++ extensions can be also exploited for link
   monitoring and topology data collection. Such functionality can be
   easily applied on top of the MPR-based flooding scheme that is used
   in ND++. Thus following the OLSR specification [RFC 3626],  link
   monitoring and topology discovery mechanisms can be brought to ND++
   and serve as a source of information for other interested processes
   in a network (especially useful in autonomic networks, where network
   monitoring is of great importance). MPRs incorporated in the process
   are therefore not only means of efficient flooding but can also be
   used to optimize data collection. The proposed Topology and Link

   Control Info Option can be used with multi-hop NA messages to enable
   network data collection. Topology and link control information is
   exchanged in a manner similar to the one described in [RFC3626].



4. Message type and format

   Below the changes proposed to extend the ND protocol are specified.
   They are incorporated as new sub-types of Neighbor Solicitation and
   Neighbor Advertisement messages or included in the proposed new
   options. Structure of options and their lengths are chosen according
   to appropriate RFCs for IPv6 [RFC4443], [RFC2460].

   An overview of IPv6 packet with inserted basic structure of NS and
   NA option is given below for reference. This figure also depicts the

5. Detailed protocol description

   Below the detailed overview of the procedures proposed for ND++
   extensions is given. It depicts:

   o  MPR processes

   o  Usage of Random ID Option

   o  Forwarding of multi-hop messages

   o  DAD++ procedure

   o  Link monitoring and topology discovery



5.1. MPR Processes

   MPRs are used for the flooding optimization. Each node in a network
   selects from its 1-hop neighborhood nodes willing to forward packets
   and being chosen in such a way that their connections cover a strict
   2-hop neighborhood in full in a locally optimal manner. These nodes
   are denoted as Multipoint Relays (MPRs) whereas the node
   initializing the process is called MPR Selector, according to
   [RFC3626]. The MPR selection procedure is performed by means of the
   proposed MPR Parameters Option and MPR Announcement Option.

   Several structures must exist to store the data necessary for MPR
   processes:

   o  Neighbors Set - a set of 1-hop neighbors along with 2-hop
      neighbors they reported

   o  MPR Set - a set of all nodes chosen to be MPRs

   o  MPR Selector Set - a set of nodes which selected the owner of the
      set as an MPR, i.e. the set of nodes for which the owner should
      forward packets

   MPR Parameters Option is attached to 1-hop Neighbor Advertisement
   message. It enables announcing the willingness of the sender to


Grajzer               Expires September 4, 2011               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          Neighbor Discovery ++                March 2011


   become MPR along with the list of its 1-hop neighbors. By default a
   node will have a willingness value set to WILL_DEFAULT [RFC3626].
   This value can be however modified to adapt to the current
   conditions in a network. Reserved field is set to zeroes. Each node
   in a network listens to the NA messages with this option and
   collects information about its neighboring nodes:

   o  their IPv6 address (only one address is used by each node to
      advertise MPR Parameters - the node's "main" address on a given
      interface; it is passed in the Target Address field of NA
      message)

   o  their willingness to become MPR

   o  IPv6 addresses of their 1-hop neighbors (excluding own address)

   Based on this information the MPR selection heuristic is used to
   choose MPRs in the way described in [RFC3626]. A node is allowed to
   send messages with this option type on a given interface only when
   it has at least one valid IPv6 address assigned to this interface
   (this would usually mean that the node has successfully completed
   the 1-hop DAD procedure and has at least link-local address
   identified as unique in the link-local scope).  Each interface has
   its own list of MPRs and the MPR processes on different interfaces
   are independent. Nodes chosen as MPRs are listed in the MPR Set.

   The MPR Announcement Option is attached to 1-hop NA message in order
   to announce by the node (being an MPR Selector) which neighbors it
   has chosen as MPRs. Addresses of all MPR neighbors are listed in the
   option one after another. A node that receives a message with this
   option checks if its own address is listed. If it finds an entry
   with one of its addresses, it keeps the sender address in the MPR
   Selector Set carrying addresses of all nodes that have chosen it as
   MPR.

   MPR Parameters option and MPR Announcement option are sent in the 1-
   hop NA messages periodically, each mpr_delay seconds. Mpr_delay is a
   configurable parameter. MPR Announcement option is attached after
   MPR Parameters option in the same message only if there are MPRs
   chosen by the sending node. The 1-hop NA message is sent with the
   following parameters:

   o  Source address - node's main address

   o  Destination address - all-nodes link-local multicast address

   o  Target address - node's main address

Internet-Draft          Neighbor Discovery ++                March 2011


   Once the interface becomes "up" the Random ID is chosen. If there is
   at least one valid address assigned to this interface, MPR processes
   will be started. If all addresses are tentative, first DAD would
   need to be completed. A node however can also initiate MPR processes
   on some interface upon receiving MPR Parameters option or MPR
   Announcement option from some other node. If at this point there is
   no valid address, the messages with MPR Parameters option of this
   node will not be sent, however attempts will be made periodically.

   At the start of MPR processes MPR lists implementing above mentioned
   Neighbour Set, MPR Set and MPR Selectors Set are initiated for a
   given interface. Then first MPR Parameters option is sent and the
   timer enabling periodic sending of MPR options is started. At each
   timer stop after mpr_delay seconds MPRs are chosen based on the
   currently known neighborhood. If the operation was successful MPR
   Announcement option is sent along with the next outgoing MPR
   Parameters option. In the opposite case, only MPR Parameters option
   is sent. The timer is started again to repeat the procedure
   periodically. It is also possible that MPRs are chosen only if a
   change in node's neighborhood was detected at timer stop. The
   performance of both cases would depend on the particular
   implementation.

   All activities related to the estimation of Link Type are performed
   as described in [RFC3626].



5.2. Usage of Random ID Option

   Random ID Option is a new option to be used in Hop-by-hop extension
   header [RFC2460]. It is used to enable the node to distinguish
   copies of its own messages forwarded back. This option is included
   in the IPv6 packet header, so such detection can be performed in
   fast and simple manner without the need for looking into packet
   content. The detection can be made regardless of message type
   conveyed by IPv6 packets, which makes this extension useful also in
   other protocols developed for MANET networks.

   Random ID option can be also used as a support for another purpose -
   limiting the number of forwarded messages. Such a usage is OPTIONAL
   - it is not mandatory, but it can enhance protocol's performance.
   MPRs which are forwarding packets can be thus responsible for
   detecting duplicate packets that are not supposed to be forwarded
   any further. The detection can be performed by means of the Sequence
   Number (SN) field in the Random ID Option of Hop-by-Hop Options
   extension header. SN is a message counter that can be incremented


Grajzer               Expires September 4, 2011               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          Neighbor Discovery ++                March 2011


   with each message sent by a node. As a result, the receiving node is
   able to infer without comparison of the message payload, that two
   messages with the same source address, destination address, Random
   ID and sequence number are duplicated.



5.3. Forwarding of multi-hop messages

   Packets having an n-hop scope, i.e. multi-hop NS and multi-hop NA
   messages, will have a Hop Limit field set to n by the packet
   originator. This implicates that they can be forwarded - in contrary
   to standard ND messages.  As such in order to ensure an efficient
   flooding of ND++ messages in the network, only nodes selected as
   MPRs are allowed to forward packets. Packets are forwarded using
   multicast transmission in IPv6 by means of all-nodes multicast
   address having a link-local scope.

   For each incoming multi-hop NS or multi-hop NA packet receiving node
   checks if the sender is its MPR Selector (is in MPR Selectors Set).
   If yes, the message is forwarded, if no - it is not. It is also
   assumed that if it happens that MPR processes are not initiated by a
   node yet, it will forward the packet anyway.

   Each forwarder is also an envisioned recipient of the message, so
   the copy of the message is forwarded, but the message itself is
   processed by the receiving node as well.



5.4. DAD++ procedure

   DAD++ procedure is performed in two stages. In the first stage of
   this process DAD in a 1-hop range is performed in a similar way as
   in the standard ND protocol. Next the part of DAD++, denoted as n-
   DAD, is performed to verify uniqueness of node's address in n-hop
   scope.

   After a new address is assigned or the need for DAD++ is
   communicated from external source (e.g. user space application,
   triggered by network administrator, etc.) node starts the DAD++
   procedure by performing 1-hop DAD. If duplication was detected at
   this stage, DAD++ is terminated and necessary actions are performed,
   as defined in [RFC4862] (the address cannot be used). However if DAD
   was completed and no duplicates were found, the procedure will
   follow with the MPR selection. Data from other nodes necessary to
   choose MPRs are collected constantly since the interface is up. The

Internet-Draft          Neighbor Discovery ++                March 2011


   MPR procedures should be performed in parallel to DAD++, however for
   safety they can be also initiated after completion of DAD. Thus
   after completion of 1-hop DAD MPRs are chosen and MPR Announcement
   option is sent to inform node's neighbors. This message is also sent
   for safety reasons, as in most cases the originating node will have
   MPRs already chosen. n-DAD procedure is started after ndad_delay
   seconds. ndad_delay parameter is configurable, but it must be larger
   than mpr_delay.

   n-DAD++ is executed by means of NS messages with multi-hop
   capabilities specified above along with option types defined in the
   basic ND protocol description for DAD. It follows the procedures
   specified for basic ND in [RFC4861]. Thus the address for which
   DAD++ is run must not be included as the source address in the IPv6
   packet [RFC4861] and is included in the Target Address field of NS
   messages. If the address is duplicated, NA message is sent by the
   node, which recognizes target address as its own, to the all-nodes
   multicast address [RFC4861]. This message is flooded within the
   network by means of MPRs. Such a solution enables performing the
   DAD++ procedure before the routing is present in a network.

   n-DAD is performed in the range of n hops. The value of n is a
   configurable protocol parameter. In general it should be chosen
   possibly large - e.g. to cover the whole MANET domain, however in
   large scale MANETs some restrictions towards the DAD++ range should
   be specified in order to keep the message overhead at a reasonable
   level. Investigation of how to choose the best Hop Limit value is
   out of the scope of this document.

   After the whole DAD++ process is completed the ND++ protocol may be
   used to fulfill the remaining goals. It's necessary however, that
   either Stateless or Stateful Address Auto-configuration is completed
   first in order to guarantee that nodes will acquire routable
   addresses.



5.5. Link monitoring and topology discovery

   In order to incorporate additional functionalities of ND++ protocol
   extension, Topology and Link Control Info Option (Figure 6) can be
   added to NA messages with multihop capabilities. This way node-local
   knowledge about topology and link states can be disseminated to
   other nodes in the network. In order to reduce the amount of the
   transmitted information only MPRs and links to MPRs of each node

   its 1-hop neighborhood. It is important that the main address of the
   originating node should be conveyed by the Target Address field in
   ICMP part of the NA message. Topology and Link Control Info Option
   is used to report the state of links between a node and its
   neighbors (inference about link types is derived from ([RFC3626]).
   Neighbors are grouped according to their type and link type between
   them and the node performing an action. Addresses of all neighbors
   from the group are incorporated into one option. Different options
   are created for different groups by exploiting Neighbor Type and
   Link Type bits in the Link Code field. Once an update to the link
   information is needed the node increments the Advertised Neighbor
   Sequence Number (ANSN), so that information recipients can be
   notified that the current message is not a copy of the previously
   sent one and the information stored in its cache should be updated
   [RFC3626].



6. Security Considerations

   TBD.



7. IANA Considerations

   This document specifies new ICMPv6 option types to be assigned for
   MPR Parameters Option, MPR Announcement Option and Topology and Link
   Control Info Option as well as new Hop-by-hop option type for Random
   ID option. Values used in this document are a subject for discussion
   and are assigned temporarily. The same holds true for the ICMPv6
   code value for usage with multihop NS and NA messages.

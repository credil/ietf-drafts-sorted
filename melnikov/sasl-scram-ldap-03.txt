Internet-Draft    LDAP schema for storing SCRAM secrets   September 2009


1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   This document describes how authPassword LDAP attribute [AUTHPASS]
   can be used for storing secrets used by [SCRAM] Simple Authentication
   and Security Layer [RFC4422] Mechanisms.

      The "scheme" part of the authPassword attribute is the SCRAM
      mechanism name (always without the "-PLUS" suffix), e.g.  "SCRAM-
      SHA-1".  See [SCRAM] for the exact syntax of SCRAM mechanism
      names.

      The "authInfo" part of the authPassword attribute is the iteration
      count, followed by ":" and base-64 [BASE64] encoded salt.

      The "authValue" part of the authPassword attribute is the base-64
      [BASE64] encoded StoredKey [SCRAM], followed by ":" and base-64
      [BASE64] encoded ServerKey [SCRAM].

   Syntax of the attribute can be expressed using ABNF [RFC5234].  Non
   terminal references in the following ABNF are defined in either
   [AUTHPASS] or [RFC5234].

       scram-mech     = "SCRAM-SHA-1"
                        ;; Complies with ABNF for <scheme>

       scram-authInfo = iter-count ":" salt
                        ;; Complies with ABNF for <authInfo>

       scram-authValue = stored-key ":" server-key
                        ;; Complies with ABNF for <authValue>

       iter-count   = %x31-39 *DIGIT
                      ; a positive number without leading zeros

       salt         = <base-64 encoded value>

       stored-key   = <base-64 encoded value>

       server-key   = <base-64 encoded value>

   [[anchor2: Add an example.]]

   Note that the authPassword attribute is multivalued.  For example, it
   may contain multiple SCRAM hashes for different hashing algorithms.


3.  Security Considerations

   Servers MUST validate format of the authPassword attribute before
   using it for performing a SCRAM authentication exchange.  It is
   possible that an attacker compromised the LDAP server or got access
   to the entry containing the attribute in order to exploit a
   vulnerability in the subsystem performing SCRAM authentication
   exchange.  Big iteration counts and invalid base-64 encoding are two
   possible (but not the only) exploits in the format specified in the
   document.


4.  IANA Considerations

   No action is required from IANA.

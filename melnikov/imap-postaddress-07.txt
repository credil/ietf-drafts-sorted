   In all examples "/" character is used as hierarchy separator.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


2.  Introduction and Overview

   IMAP POSTADDRESS extension can be used to discover an email address
   for a given IMAP mailbox.  Many email clients support saving a copy
   of an outgoing message in "sent messages" or "outbox" mailbox.
   Typically, those email clients send the message first using SMTP.
   After that they upload a copy of the message using IMAP APPEND.
   Effectively, the message is sent twice: once using SMTP and once
   using IMAP.  If the IMAP server supports the POSTADDRESS extension,
   the mail client can avoid uploading a copy of the message using IMAP
   APPEND.  This can be achieved by specifying an additional SMTP
   recipient, returned by LIST RETURN (POSTADDRESS) command, during
   submission.

   Note: Similar functionality can be provided when the message to be
   sent out is first uploaded with IMAP APPEND command to the IMAP
   server and then submitted using IMAP [RFC4467] and SMTP [RFC4468]
   extensions.  See section 2.1 for the detailed comparison between
   POSTADDRESS and URLAUTH/BURL.

   A server that supports POSTADDRESS parameter to the LIST command MUST
   return "POSTADDRESS" in its capability response.  Any server
   supporting the POSTADDRESS extension defined in this document MUST
   also support the LIST-EXTENDED extension defined in [LISTEXT].

2.1.  Comparison of POSTADDRESS with URLAUTH/BURL

   Note that the POSTADDRESS extension is easier to implement on the
   server then the combination of IMAP [RFC4467] and SMTP [RFC4468]
   extensions.

   There are certain situations when the POSTADDRESS extension provides
   functionality not otherwise available with URLAUTH/BURL:

   1.  The POSTADDRESS extension can be used when message assembly is
       done during submission using multiple BDAT [RFC3030] and/or BURL



Melnikov                 Expires March 26, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         IMAP4 POSTADDRESS extension        September 2010


       [RFC4468] commands.  URLAUTH/BURL requires that a fully assembled
       message is first uploaded/created in an IMAP mailbox.

   2.  The POSTADDRESS extension can be used to save a copy of the
       message in multiple email accounts on one or different server, or
       in the IMAP mailbox located on a different IMAP server.  For
       example, a user might have access to different IMAP accounts in
       her client, but would like to save all messages she sent in a
       mailbox on one of the servers.

   3.  A POSTADDRRESS email address can be used as the envelope MAIL
       FROM address (to capture bounces), or as the RFC2822 From
       address, for subscribing to mailing lists, etc.

   There are some performance related advantages of using POSTADDRESS:

   If all the message data is generated locally, use of APPEND/
   GENURLAUTH [RFC4467] takes 2 round-trips:

   C: IMAP APPEND
   S: ...returns the UID of the appended message...
   C: GENURLAUTH for the appended message (using URL constructed
   from the UID)
   S: URL to be used in BURL

   Some clients may require an additional round-trip to determine if the
   submission server supports BURL.  This may be elided if the server
   advertises "BURL imap" in the first EHLO response, or if the client
   either assumes this to be the case, or if it has this capability
   cached.

   When using POSTADDRESS, the client needs to discover the posting
   email address for a mailbox once and can cache it after that.  The
   two round-trips mentioned above will be saved for each submitted
   message.  This is a plus for links with high latency.

   Note, that any returned POSTADDRESS email address may be subject to
   user-controlled delivery filtering, such as [RFC5228], which may
   cause a message sent to the email address to be delivered into a
   different mailbox or be discarded.


3.  LIST command with the POSTADDRESS parameter

   This document defines a new return option POSTADDRESS to the extended
   LIST command [LISTEXT] that requests the server to return an email
   address that can be used to post email to a mailbox returned by the
   LIST command.  The POSTADDRESS return option causes the server to

Internet-Draft         IMAP4 POSTADDRESS extension        September 2010


   return the LIST response with the POSTADDRESS information (see
   section 4).

   The returned email address (if any, see below) doesn't have to be
   permanently available and MAY be different for different invocations
   of the LIST command.  However if the returned address is generated
   anew each time, it MUST be valid for use for at least 2 hours since
   the moment it was generated.

   If posting to the mailbox is not allowed or not supported the server
   MUST return NIL.  For example, if the server also supports [ACL]
   extension and if the user that is issuing LIST RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
   is not granted the "p" right on the mailbox (the "p" right might be
   granted to the user directly, or through one of the groups the user
   belongs to, e.g. it may be granted to the "anonymous"), the extended
   LIST response MUST return NIL in POSTADDRESS information.  Note, that
   the last requirement doesn't eliminate the need for the SMTP server
   to enforce access controls on delivery, as the returned email address
   may be passed by the IMAP client to a third party, not trusted by the
   SMTP server.

   Also note, that if the server also supports [ACL] extension and if
   the user doesn't have either "l" or "r" right on the mailbox, the
   server MUST NOT disclose the mailbox existence.

   Example:    C: A002 LIST () "" INBOX RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
               S: * LIST () "/" INBOX ("POSTADDRESS" (
                  "user1@example.com"))
               S: A002 OK List with postaddress info completed


   Note that the empty () after the LIST command name are not required,
   which is shown below:

   Example:    C: A002 LIST "" Drafts RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
               S: * LIST (\Marked) "/" Drafts ("POSTADDRESS" NIL)
               S: A002 OK List with postaddress info completed


   The following 2 examples demonstrate email addresses that require RFC
   2821 quoting of the localpart:

   Example:    C: A002 LIST "" "foo bar" RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
               S: * LIST () "/" "foo bar" ("POSTADDRESS" (
                  "\"user1+foo bar\"@example.com"))
               S: A002 OK List with postaddress info completed

Internet-Draft         IMAP4 POSTADDRESS extension        September 2010


   Example:    C: A002 LIST () "" "foo bar" RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
               S: * LIST () "/" "foo bar" (POSTADDRESS ({27}
               S: "user1+foo bar"@example.com))
               S: A002 OK List with postaddress info completed


   The following example demonstrates that a non-existent subscribed
   mailbox doesn't have a corresponding post address:

   Example:    C: A03 LIST (SUBSCRIBED) "" "*" RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
               ...
               S: * LIST (\Subscribed \NonExistent) "/" "Fruit/Peach"
               (POSTADDRESS NIL)
               ...


   The SUBSCRIBED selection option is described in [LISTEXT].


4.  Extended LIST response with POSTADDRESS information

   Contents:  name attributes
               hierarchy delimiter
               mailbox name
               email address for posting to the mailbox

   This version of the LIST response occurs as a result of a LIST RETURN
   (POSTADDRESS) command.  The proposed syntax conforms to the syntax of
   an extended LIST response as defined by mailbox-list ABNF element
   from [LISTEXT].

   The meaning of "name attributes" and "hierarchy delimiter" is
   described in section 7.2.2 of [RFC3501].  This is followed by the
   extension part that includes "POSTADDRESS" tag followed by an email
   address (enclosed in parenthesis) that can be used to post email to
   the mailbox.  The returned email address MUST match the "Mailbox"
   ABNF production from [RFC5321].  If no such address exists for the
   mailbox, the server MUST return NIL.

   The POSTADDRESS extended data item can occur only once in an extended
   LIST response.  If the server knows multiple email addresses
   associated with a mailbox, it must return only one of them.

   Example:    S: * LIST () "/" Sent ("POSTADDRESS" (
                  "user+Sent@example.com"))

5.  Formal Syntax

   Formal syntax is defined using ABNF [ABNF], extending the ABNF rules
   in section 9 of [RFC3501].  Non-terminals referenced but not defined
   below are as defined in [RFC3501] and [LISTEXT].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

   capability      =/  "POSTADDRESS"
                     ;;capability is defined in [RFC3501]


   postaddr-label  = "POSTADDRESS"


   return-option   =/  postaddr-label
                     ;; <return-option> is defined in [LISTEXT]


   postaddr-labret = postaddr-label /
                     DQUOTE postaddr-label DQUOTE /
                     "{11}" CRLF postaddr-label
                     ;; POSTADDRESS label represented as IMAP atom,
                     ;; quoted or literal string


   postaddr-data   = postaddr-labret SP emaddr-or-nil
                     ;; postaddr-data conforms to the syntax of
                     ;; mbox-list-extended-item from [LISTEXT]


   emaddr-or-nil   = "(" email-address ")" /
                     NIL
                     ;; NIL if email address is not known


   email-address   = astring



6.  Security Considerations

   Unless proper access restrictions are implemented, the POSTADDRESS
   extension can be used by a user to harvest email addresses.  Note
   that email address harvesting is limited to users who already have

   IMAP access to the service.  Also note that some IMAP servers allow
   for anonymous access.

   Note that some implementations might return IMAP mailbox names in the
   addresses returned by POSTADDRESS (e.g. if "subaddressing" is used
   (see Section 3.1.1 of [RFC5598])), which might be considered a
   confidential information.  Use of connection encryption such as TLS
   [RFC5246] is recommended to protect such confidential information.

   Also note that interception of the addresses returned by the
   POSTADDRESS extension may enable a third party to inject mail to a
   specific mailbox.  However this issue is not specific to this
   extension and can also be seen whenever "subaddressing" is used.

   Additional security considerations are discussed in Section 3.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   at:


      http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities


   This document defines the POSTADDRESS IMAP capability.  IANA is
   requested to add it to the registry.

   IANA is also requested to register the following LISTEXT return
   option as specified in [LISTEXT]:

   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of LISTEXT option POSTADDRESS
   LISTEXT option name: POSTADDRESS
   LISTEXT option type: RETURN
   LISTEXT option description: Causes the LIST command to return
   email address (if any) for posting to a returned mailbox.

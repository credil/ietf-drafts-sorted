Adapted Multimedia Internet KEYing (AMIKEY): An extension of Multimedia
      Internet KEYing (MIKEY) Methods for Generic LLN Environments
               draft-alexander-roll-mikey-lln-key-mgmt-01

Abstract

   Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) is a key management protocol used
   for real-time applications.  As standardized within RFC3830 it
   defines four key distribution methods, including pre-shared keys,
   public-key encryption, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange, with
   allowances for ready protocol extension.  A number of additional
   methods have been developed and continue to be built from the base
   protocol (see for example, RFC4442, RFC4563, RFC4650, RFC4738,
   RFC5410, RFC6043 and RFC6267.  However, in spite of its extensibility
   and more general applicability, MIKEY and its related extensions have
   primarily focused on the support of the Secure Real-time Transport
   Protocol (SRTP).

   This document specifies a simple adaptation of the MIKEY
   specification to allow the base protocol and its various key
   management mode extensions to be readily applied in more general
   environments beyond the multimedia SRTP domain.  In particular, the
   document defines a repurposing of the MIKEY multimedia crypto
   sessions structure and introduces a set of message extensions to the
   base specification to allow the MIKEY key management methods to be
   applied within Low-power and Lossy networks (LLNs) and other general
   constrained-device networks.

Internet-Draft           MIKEY Extension for LLN               July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Any sufficiently large scale network offering security services
   requires an automated key management mechanism for the exchange of
   keys and the update of related security credentials [RFC4107].  Key
   management may be needed for individual session exchanges or for the
   long-term control and update of security parameters from which
   session keys may be derived.  In many Low-power and Lossy networks
   (LLN) and other constrained-device environments, key management
   emphasis is often on the management of long-term keys.  This may
   automatically follow network associations based on device pre-
   configuration or may be based on specified key lifetimes or
   administrative or event-driven need for key credential changes.  This
   would apply to the case of a network routing protocol like RPL
   ([I-D.ietf-roll-rpl]) that employs security as well as to other
   secured communications layer protocols.

   Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) is a key management protocol that
   has been used for real-time applications both for peer-to-peer and
   group communications.  The capabilities of the protocol lend
   themselves just as readily to the management of long-term keys as to
   per-session or per association key control.  MIKEY [RFC3830] defines
   four key distribution methods including pre-shared keys, public-key
   encryption, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  Given its design
   simplicity, efficiency and flexibility a number of additional modes
   and extensions have indeed been developed and continue to be built
   from the base protocol (see for example, [RFC4442], [RFC4563],
   [RFC4650], [RFC4738], [RFC5410], [RFC6043] and [RFC6267]).  MIKEY and
   its related RFC extensions have however primarily focused on the
   support of the SRTP and related Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   call scenarios [RFC3711].

   This document specifies an adaptation of the MIKEY protocol
   specification to allow the base protocol and its various key
   management mode extensions to be more generally applied to LLN
   environments.  In particular, the document defines a repurposing of
   the MIKEY multimedia crypto sessions structure to allow optional
   support for simultaneous management of multiple protocol or device
   interface key.  The specification also introduces a set of message
   extensions to the base MIKEY protocol to allow its key management
   methods to be applied within generic LLN and constrained-device
   networks.

1.1.  Motivation

   Key distribution describes the process of delivering cryptographic
   keys to the required communicating parties.  The MIKEY protocol has
   defined the mechanisms for establishing the security context used by

Internet-Draft           MIKEY Extension for LLN               July 2011


   SRTP however the mechanisms for security parameter negotiation and
   update is just as readily extended to LLN protocols.

   The flexibly to employ different key distribution methods according
   to available network infrastructure and particular operating
   scenarios together with the compact efficiency of its binary
   specification makes MIKEY well suited for general LLN use.  The wide
   range of key management support extending from light-weight, low
   latency half round-trip pre-shared key distribution methods to multi-
   exchange Diffie-Hellman key agreements protected with digital
   signatures or pre-shared keys offers great flexibility to meet the
   needs of diverse LLN application environments.

   The option to embed the MIKEY key management messages within an
   existing network signaling protocol or to be directly transported or
   UDP or TCP (using port 2269) also increases the ability to apply the
   methods in more general LLN domains.

   MIKEY has met its original stated design goals [RFC3830] of end-to-
   end security, simplicity, efficiency, tunneling (even beyond
   integration with Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] or RTCP
   [RFC3605]), and independence of underlying transport.  In so doing it
   offers an excellent base for a generic key management protocol for
   Low-power Lossy Network (LLN) application.  Key management protocols
   are also difficult to design and validate (see [RFC4107] guidelines)
   providing a further motivation for reliance on an established
   protocol like MIKEY that has had the benefit of wider operational
   deployment and evaluation.

1.2.  MIKEY Key Management Methods Background

   As noted in [RFC5197], several key distribution methods have been
   described for MIKEY, including:

   o  Symmetric key distribution as defined in [RFC3830] (MIKEY-PSK)

   o  Asymmetric key distribution as defined in [RFC3830] (MIKEY-RSA)

   o  Diffie-Hellman key agreement protected by digital signatures as
      defined in [RFC3830] (MIKEY-DHSIGN)

   o  Diffie-Hellman key agreement protected by symmetric pre-shared
      keys as defined in [RFC4650] (MIKEY-DHHMAC)

   o  Asymmetric key distribution (based on asymmetric encryption) with
      in-band certificate provision as defined in [RFC4738]
      (MIKEY-RSA-R)

Internet-Draft           MIKEY Extension for LLN               July 2011


   Further extensions to MIKEY comprising algorithm enhancements and new
   payload definitions have since been defined generally motivated by
   the specific problems associated with SIP signaling and associated
   multimedia use case scenarios (see [RFC5197]for an earlier
   assessment).  This specification proposes a new extension that is
   focused on a new domain of application.

1.3.  Adapting MIKEY to General LLNs

   This document specifies is a set of additional message information
   elements to the base MIKEY protocol that provide both algorithm and
   message payload extensions.  These additions allow the adapted
   protocol to be used directly for key transport and security policy
   specification between communications generic network entities.
   Furthermore, through integration within the base MIKEY specification
   it will allow current and future key methods and extensions to be
   utilized outside of the current multimedia environment.

   The developed protocol adaption includes the specification of
   alternative default algorithms (in particular AES-based) and
   configurations that are particular to more constrained communications
   devices and using MIKEY's general extensibility to define new
   elements applicable to the LLN environment.

   An important element of the protocol extension is the re-use of the
   MIKEY crypto-session structure to apply to individual device
   communications protocol layers or interfaces instead of applying to
   multimedia streams.  By maintaining this base protocol structure and
   re-purposing associated message identifiers, the specification
   minimizes the protocol changes needed for network adaptation.

   As with the original specification the intent is to allow MIKEY
   messages to be embedded into existing communications signaling
   protocols or to be independently transported between communicating
   entities over UDP or TCP transport connections.

   Note: While MIKEY and its extensions provide a variety of choices in
   terms of modes of operation, implementations for a given LLN
   application domain will be able to simplify node behavior by
   operating in a single mode.  To ensure necessary interoperability
   within the LLN environment, mandatory methods within the Adapted
   MIKEY protocol (AMIKEY), akin to those of MIKEY, shall be specified.

1.4.  Terminology and Definitions

   The following definitions have been taken from [RFC3830] with
   necessary augmentation for AMIKEY as indicated:

Internet-Draft           MIKEY Extension for LLN               July 2011


   (Data) Security Protocol
         The security protocol used to protect the actual data traffic.
         Examples of security protocols are IPsec and SRTP.  For generic
         LLNs, security protocols may include secure versions of
         protocols such as RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   Data SA
         Data Security Association information for the security
         protocol, including a TEK and a set of parameters/policies.

   CS    Crypto Session, uni- or bidirectional data stream(s) protected
         by a single instance of a security protocol.  For AMIKEY the
         concept of a crypto-session is expanded to allow definition of
         a particular protocol layer, logical device interface, or other
         communications association for which key management support is
         provided.

   CSB   Crypto Session Bundle, collection of one or more Crypto
         Sessions, which can have common TGKs (see below) and security
         parameters.

   CS ID Crypto Session ID, unique identifier for the CS within a CSB.
         For AMIKEY the CS ID is used to identify a specific protocol
         layer, logical device interface or other communications
         association for which AMIKEY is being used to support key
         management (establishment of re-keying update).

   CSB ID
         Crypto Session Bundle ID, unique identifier for the CSB.  For
         AMIKEY the CSB ID in conjunction with the Timestamp filed is
         used as a unique key management exchange message reference
         identifier.  This identifier will allow for the acknowledged
         key management message exchanges where applicable.  The ID plus
         timestamp will also support the filtering of repeated or
         redundant AMIKEY messages when key management occurs over an
         unreliable transport network.

   TGK   TEK Generation Key, a bit-string agreed upon by two or more
         parties, associated with CSB.  From the TGK, Traffic-Encrypting
         Keys can then be generated without needing further
         communication.

   TEK   Traffic-Encrypting Key, the key used by the security protocol
         to protect the CS (this key may be used directly by the
         security protocol or may be used to derive further keys
         depending on the security protocol).  The TEKs are derived from
         the CSB's TGK.

   The following definitions have been added to the ones from [RFC3830]
   specifically related to supporting AMIKEY:

   Key Index
         The Key Index (KI) is used as identifier to allow for reference
         to the key(s) that are associated with a given CS.  Where TEKs
         may be updated over time a TGK can be associated with a KI that
         is transported as a payload within the AMIKEY message from the
         Initiator.  Any TEK generated from the AMIKEY TGK shall be
         assigned the key index value associated with the TGK.  Within
         general LLN protocol communications related to a given CS
         (device layer protocol or interface), to ensure security
         association synchronization reference can be made to the key
         index that is being applied for the given protocol security.
         Following successfully TGK key establishment communicating
         devices can verify security contexts through reference to
         maintained KI (see Section 6.16).

   Key Source Identifier
         The Key Source Identifier (KSI) is used as a logical identifier
         to allow for refernece to the entity associated with the
         origination of a given TGK.  Where TEKs are dynamically
         generated or updated, each TGK can be associated with a
         specific key source.  The KSI, when used, is transported as a
         payload within the AMIKEY message from the entity responsible
         for the TGK origination (see Section 6.17).

1.5.  Document Outline

   Section 2 provides a brief general system overview of key management
   as introduced in MIKEY specification.  This section generalizes the
   context in which the Adapted MIKEY (AMIKEY) protocol extension is
   applied.  It also provides a reference to the common key management
   operating base of MIKEY and AMIKEY.

   Sections 3 to 4 go into further detail by identifying the specific
   section and subsection extensions and enhancements needed to support
   the MIKEY protocol adaptation.  These Sections mirror those of MIKEY
   [RFC3830] and are used to show the necessary commonality and make
   reference to specific changes would be required for AMIKEY.
   Reference is made only to the applicable Sections and Subsections of
   [RFC3830] for which special changes are proposed.

   Section 6 includes the specific protocol specification elements that
   are needed to extend MIKEY for the support of the generic LLN key
   management requirements.

   draft sections.

1.6.  Section Headings Notation

   This document is written as a delta document to [RFC3830].  For ease
   of cross-reference and to maintain consistency with the MIKEY
   specification document structure, Section heading and Table and
   Figure numbers are maintained consistent with the [RFC3830] usage.

   The notation of Section number followed by [RFC3830] "x.x.
   [RFC3830]" is used is this document for Sections specifically meant
   to align with [RFC3830].  Section numbers followed by [RFC3830] with
   additional heading text indicates some new element or clarification
   introduced by this specification.  Section numbers followed by
   [RFC3830] without further heading text implies no change to [RFC3830]
   and is used only to align and maintain the current document headings
   structure.

   The new parameters introduced in this specification are made
   consistent with the MIKEY recommendations (see Section 4.2.9
   [RFC3830]).


2.  AMIKEY Overview

   This section provides an overview of AMIKEY.  Material from MIKEY
   [RFC3830] is also repeated to clearly establish the common context in
   which MIKEY can be applied to LLN environments with the simple
   extension to the Adapted MIKEY (AMIKEY) specification.

   The objective of the AMIKEY extension is exactly the same as that of
   MIKEY - "to produce a data security association (SA) for a security
   protocol, including a Traffic-Encrypting Key (TEK), which is derived
   from a TEK Generation Key (TGK), and used as input for the security
   protocol."  In the case of AMIKEY the objective is support generic
   security protocols and particularly those that may be associated with
   LLNs.

   AMIKEY uses the specified MIKEY mechanisms and features to "support
   the possibility of establishing keys and parameters for more than one
   security protocol (or for several instances of the same security
   protocol) at the same time."  In MIKEY the Crypto Session Bundle
   (CSB), which derives from the multimedia (multi-stream) context, is
   used to denote this collection of one or more Crypto Sessions that
   can have a common TGK and security parameters, but that obtain
   distinct TEKs from MIKEY.

   In the AMIKEY extension, the concept of CSB is used to provide the

Internet-Draft           MIKEY Extension for LLN               July 2011


   option of simultaneously establishing multiple SAs on a given device.
   The individual Crypto Session (CS) SAs may be associated with
   different device layer or device interface security protocols.
   AMIKEY further uses the flexibility of the MIKEY specification to
   allow separate security policies to be defined in the SA established
   for each security protocol.  The distribution mechanisms defined by
   MIKEY for re-keying and updating of established security associations
   is hence also directly applied.  The ability to establish and
   maintain multiple SAs through a single key management association
   provides an important efficiency element in LLN domains.

   As specified in [RFC3830], Section 2.3, the procedure of setting up a
   CSB and creating a TEK (and Data SA), is done in accordance with
   Figure 1:

   1.  A set of security parameters and TGK(s) are agreed upon for the
       Crypto Session Bundle.  This is done by one of many alternative
       key transport/exchange mechanisms (see [RFC3830], Section 3, as
       well as subsequent extension RFCs).

   2.  The TGK(s) is used to derive (in a cryptographically secure way)
       a TEK for each Crypto Session or associated security protocol.

   3.  The TEK, together with the security protocol parameters,
       represent the Data SA, which is used as the input to the security
       protocol(s).

     Figure 1: Overview of MIKEY (and AMIKEY extension) key management
                                 procedure

   For generic LLNs that are the focus of this document, the default
   algorithms applied in the generation of the TEK for each protocol is
   defined within this AMIKEY specification.  An additional MIKEY
   message extension is also specified to define the security protocol
   parameters (policies) for generic LLNs.

   Whereas MIKEY CS IDs are associated with multimedia streams and have
   no intrinsic designation, in this specification the CS IDs are
   assigned values (public or private/vendor-specific) that are used to
   identify security protocols associated with specific device protocol
   layers or device interfaces.

   As considered for the device security model discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-security-framework], Section 6.5, Figure 2 provides an
   overview of the key management context introduced by the AMIKEY
   extension defined in this specification.  The multi-protocol key
   management capability (through the particular use of the MIKEY CS-
   IDs) allows for the efficient, simultaneous management and update of
   one or more protocol layer security parameters.

    Figure 2: Overview of AMIKEY Multi-protocol Key Management Context

   As in the base MIKEY specification, the security protocol can either
   use the TEK directly, or, if supported, derive further session keys
   from the TEK.  It is however up to the targeted security protocol and
   the associated security policy to define how the TEK is used.

   MIKEY can be used to update TEKs and the Crypto Sessions in a current
   Crypto Session Bundle (see [RFC3830], Section 4.5).  This is done by
   executing the transport/exchange phase once again to obtain a new TGK
   (and consequently derive new TEKs) or to update some other specific
   CS parameters.

3.  AMIKEY Extension Elements

   The following Section and Subsections detail the proposed additions
   to the MIKEY specification [RFC3830] to support the AMIKEY extension.
   The Section heading outline of the MIKEY specification is used to
   indicate the delta changes made by the AMIKEY extension.

3.1.  [RFC3830] Pre-shared key

3.2.  [RFC3830] Public-Key Encryption

3.3.  [RFC3830] Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange


4.  [RFC3830] Selected Key Management Functions

   For AMIKEY all the key derivation functionality defined in MIKEY
   shall be based on a new default Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) given by
   the AES-based, AES-XCBC-PRF-128 algorithm as specified in [RFC4434].

4.1.  [RFC3830] Key Calculation

4.1.1.  [RFC3830] Assumptions

   For AMIKEY cs_id is defined so that session represents a protocol
   layer, logical device interface, or communications association.  The
   cs-id values shall be as defined in this specification (see
   Section 6.1.2) and may be public or private/vendor-specific.

4.1.2.  [RFC3830] Default PRF Description

   For AMIKEY the default pseudo random function shall be AES-XCBC-PRF-
   128 [RFC4434].  Note: AES-XCBC-PRF-128 aligns with HMAC-SHA1 and
   HMAC-MD5 as PRFs.

4.1.3.  [RFC3830] Generating Keys from TGK

   For AMIKEY the cs-id values shall be as defined in this specification
   (see Section 6.1.2).

4.1.4.  [RFC3830] Generating Keys for MIKEY Messages from an Envelope/
        Pre-shared Key

   Change from default PRF to the default AMIKEY PRF given in
   Section 4.1.2 of this specification.

   Note: For AMIKEY, the Authentication key constant SHALL be used for
   generating the single TEK in the case of authenticated encryption

   algorithms (such as AES-CCM).

4.2.  [RFC3830] Pre-defined Transforms and Timestamp Formats

4.2.1.  [RFC3830] Hash Functions

   For AMIKEY the default hash function shall be AES-XCBC-PRF-128
   [RFC4434].

4.2.2.  [RFC3830] Pseudo-Random Number Generator

   For AMIKEY it shall be MANDATORY to implement the new default AES-
   XCBC-PRF-128 PRF specified in [RFC4434] (See Section 4.1.2 of this
   specification).

4.2.3.  [RFC3830] Key Data Transport Encryption

   As in MIKEY the default and mandatory-to-implement key transport
   encryption shall be AES in Counter mode using a 128-bit key (derived
   as defined in Section 4.1.4 above).  The applied Counter shall be the
   IV defined in [RFC3830], Section 4.2.3.

4.2.4.  [RFC3830] MAC Verification Message Function

   For AMIKEY AES-CCM-64 shall be the defined default for key message
   authentication.  The Counter used shall be the IV defined in
   [RFC3830], Section 4.2.3.

4.3.  [RFC3830] Certificates, Policies and Authorization

4.4.  [RFC3830] Retrieving the Data SA

   For AMIKEY the retrieval of a Data SA will depend on the security
   protocol.  The support for different security protocols shall be
   explicitly identified through the use of public CS ID values (see
   Section 6.1.2 of this specification).


5.  [RFC3830] Behavior and Message Handling


6.  [RFC3830] Payload Encoding

   The generic LLN security protocol parameters may be transported
   between peers as part of a key establishment or re-keying exchange.
   Based on IANA registration, MIKEY currently only defines two payloads
   for transporting the security policy information (see Section 6.10 of
   [RFC3830] and [RFC4442]).  This section describes the extension of

   MIKEY to allow the transport of Generic LLN security policy
   information and associated key(s) as well as applicable PRF used for
   key derivation.

   This section describes, in detail, the payload for support of the
   Generic LLN security protocol(s) specified by the Adapted MIKEY
   protocol.  As in RFC3830, for all encoding, network byte order is
   always used, and the sign ~ indicates a variable length field.

6.1.  [RFC3830] Common Header Payload (HDR)

   The Common Header payload MUST always be present as the first payload
   in each message.  The Common Header includes a general description of
   the exchange message.

      this payload.  See Section 6.1 [RFC3830] for values.

   o  KSI len (8 bits): indicates the length of the key source
      identifier field.

   o  KSI value (variable length): specifies the logical identifier
      assigned to the Source or Originator of a given TGK.

6.18.  Key Activation Time Payload

   For AMIKEY the Key Activation time payload is used to specify the
   time at which a new key derived from a communicated TGK shall become
   active for the associated device protocol or interface.  The Key
   Activation time is used only when needed to specify a delay or future
   activation of an updated key.  The format of this AMIKEY information
   element type shall be the same as that of the Timestamp payload (T)
   [RFC3830].

      time at which a new derived TEK shall become active (See Section
      6.6 [RFC3830]).

   o  TS value (variable length): the timestamp value of the specified
      TS type (See Section 6.6 [RFC3830]).


7.  [RFC3830] Transport Protocols

   As in [RFC3830], AMIKEY may be integrated within session
   establishment or other system signaling protocols or may be directly
   transported over UDP or TCP.  Where AMIKEY messages are integrated
   into other LLN-related signaling protocols its transport shall be
   defined as part of those protocols.


8.  Security Considerations

   A primary motivation for this RFC is the security that comes from a
   re-use of the key management methods and framework developed for
   MIKEY.  The extensive deployment and on-going development provides
   the benefit of much wider vetting and validation essential to
   assuring greater security.


9.  [RFC3830] Groups


10.  Additional Specification Considerations

   Work had been previously initiated in developing support for an ECC-
   based asymmetric key management method ([I-D.ietf-msec-mikey-ecc],
   expired).  In the context of LLNs application and subject to IPR
   considerations, related AMIKEY requirements may be developed.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines several new name spaces associated with the
   AMIKEY payloads.  This section summarizes the name spaces for which
   IANA is requested to manage the allocation of values.  IANA is
   requested to record the pre-defined values defined in the given
   sections for each name space.  IANA is also requested to manage the
   definition of additional values in the future.  Unless explicitly
   stated otherwise, values in the range 0-240 for each name space
   SHOULD be approved by the process of IETF consensus and values in the
   range 241-255 are reserved for Private Use, according to [RFC2434].

   The name spaces for the new fields identified in this document are
   requested to be managed by IANA (in bracket is the reference to the
   table with the initially registered values):

        Access Network Information Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6
          draft-gundavelli-netext-access-network-option-01.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a mechanism and a related mobility option
   for carrying the access network identifier and the access operator
   identification information from the mobile access gateway to the
   local mobility anchor over Proxy Mobile IPv6.  Based on the received
   information, the local mobility anchor is able to provide access
   network and access operator specific handling or policing for the
   mobile node traffic.

Internet-Draft      Access Network Information Option          July 2011


1.  Introduction

   In many deployments there is a need for the local mobility anchor to
   provide differentiated services and policing to the mobile nodes
   based on the access network to which they are attached.  Policy
   systems in mobility architectures such as PCC [TS23203] and ANDSF
   [TS23402] in 3GPP system allow configuration of policy rules with
   conditions based on the access network information.  For example, the
   service treatment for the mobile node's traffic may be different when
   they are attached to a access network owned by the home operator than
   when owned by a roaming partner.  The service treatment can also be
   different based on the configured SSID in case of IEEE 802.11 based
   access networks.

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213] allows carrying of the
   Access Technology Type (ATT) information from the mobile access
   gateway to the local mobility anchor.  However, the Access Technology
   Type alone is not sufficient for correct policy to be applied at the
   LMA and there is a need to ensure additional information related to
   the access network is available.  Learning the access network
   operator identity may not be possible for an LMA without a support of
   an additional policy framework that is able to provide required
   information out of band to the LMA.  Such a policy framework may not
   be required for all Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployments and hence an
   alternative approach for carrying such information is required to
   ensure that additional information related to the access network is
   available.

   This document defines a new mobility option, Access Network
   Identifier (ANI) option for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), that can be
   used by mobile access gateway (MAG) for carrying the access network
   information to the local mobility anchor.  The specific details on
   how the local mobility anchor uses this information is out-of-scope
   for this document.

   Figure 1, illustrates the scenario where the IEEE 802.11 Access
   Points are configured to the mobile access gateway.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the
   following abbreviations:

   ANDSF

      Access Network Discovery and Selection Framework

   PCC

      Policy and Charging Control Framework

   Service Set Identifier

      Service Set Identifier (SSID) identifies the name of the IEEE
      802.11 network.  SSID differentiates from one network to the
      other.

   Vendor ID

      The Vendor ID is the SMI Network Management Private Enterprise
      Code of the IANA-maintained Private Enterprise Numbers registry
      [SMI].


3.  Protocol Considerations

   The following considerations apply to the local mobility anchor and
   the mobile access gateway.

   o  The conceptual Binding Cache entry data structure maintained by
      the local mobility anchor, described in Section 5.1 of [RFC5213],
      MUST be extended to store the access network information

      associated with the current session.  Specifically, the following
      parameters must be defined.

      Network Identifier

      Operator Identifier

   o  The conceptual Binding Update List entry data structure maintained
      by the mobile access gateway, described in Section 6.1 of
      [RFC5213], MUST be extended to store the access network
      information associated with the current session.  Specifically,
      the following parameters must be defined.

      Network Identifier

      Operator Identifier

   o  The mobile access gateway may be statically configured with the
      access network information related to the access links its
      attached to.  In access systems where the mobile access gateway is
      attached to a micro-mobility domain such as IEEE 802.11 WLAN
      domain, the DHCP relay agent function in that micro-mobility
      domain may be configured to add the access network information in
      DHCP option (82), which is the DHCP Relay Agent Information option
      [RFC3046].  The mobile access gateway may learn the access network
      information from this option.

   o  On receiving a Proxy Binding Update message [RFC5213] from a
      mobile access gateway with the Access Network Information option,
      the local mobility anchor must process the option and update the
      corresponding fields in the Binding Cache entry.

   o  The local mobility anchor MAY choose to use the access network
      information options for applying any access operator specific
      handling or policing of the mobile node traffic.


4.  Access Network Identifier Option

   A new option, Access Network Information option, is defined for using
   it in Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   (PBA) messages exchanged between a local mobility anchor and a mobile
   access gateway.  This option is used for carrying the information
   related to the access network to which the mobile node is attached.

   The alignment requirement for this option is 4n.

                Figure 2: Access Network Identifier Option

   Type

      TBD by IANA

      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length in octets of the
      option, excluding the type and length fields.

   Op-ID Type

      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the type of the Operator
      Identifier.  Currently the following types are defined:

      1.  reserved.

      2.  Vendor ID as a Private Enterprise Number [SMI].

      3.  Realm of the operator.  Realm names are required to be unique,
          and are piggybacked on the administration of the DNS
          namespace.

      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of octets-1 needed to
      encode the Operator Identifier.

   Nw-ID Type

      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the type of the Network
      Identifier.  Currently the following types are defined:

      1.  reserved.

      2.  SSID of the IEEE 802.11 network.

      3.  Geolocation of the Access Point

   Nw-ID Length

      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of octets-1 needed to
      encode the Network Identifier.

   Network Identifier

      Up to 256 octets of the network identifier.  The encoding of the
      identifier depends on the used Nw-ID Type.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new Mobility Header option, the Access
   Network Information.  This option is described in Section 4.  The
   Type value for this option needs to be assigned from the same
   numbering space as allocated for the other mobility options, as
   defined in [RFC3775].

   Furthermore, this specification creates a two new name spaces: Op-ID
   Type ND NW-ID Type.  Both are described with their initial
   allocations in Section 4.  These two name spaces are placed under the
   Mobile IPv6 parameters registry for [RFC3775].


6.  Security Considerations

   The Access Network Information option defined in this specification
   is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages.  This option is carried like any other mobility header
   option as specified in [RFC3775] and does not require any special
   security considerations.

   The Access Technology Type option [RFC5213] is always present in the
   Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages.
   Carrying additional details related to the access network to which
   the mobile node is attached does not introduce any new security

                   Multicast Forwarding Using Trickle
                    draft-hui-6man-trickle-mcast-01

Abstract

   Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are typically composed of
   resource constrained nodes communicating over links that have dynamic
   characteristics.  Memory constraints coupled with temporal variations
   in link connectivity makes the use of topology maintenance to support
   IPv6 multicast challenging.  This document describes the use of
   Trickle to efficiently forward multicast messages without the need
   for topology maintenance.

Internet-Draft        Trickle Multicast Forwarding          January 2011


1.  Introduction

   The resource constraints of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) may
   preclude the use of existing IPv6 multicast forwarding mechanisms.
   Such networks are typically constrained in resources (limited channel
   capacity, processing power, energy capacity, memory).  In particular
   memory constraints may limit nodes to maintaining state for only a
   small subset of neighbors.  Limited channel and energy capacity
   require protocols to remain efficient and robust even in dense
   topologies.

   Traditional IP multicast forwarding typically relies on topology
   maintenance mechanisms to efficiently forward multicast messages to
   the intended destinations.  In some cases, topology maintenance
   involves maintaining multicast trees to reach all subscribers of a
   multicast group.  Maintaining such topologies is difficult especially
   when memory constraints are such that nodes can only maintain a
   default route.  Dynamic properties of wireless networks can make
   control traffic prohibitively expensive.  In wireless environments,
   topology maintenance may involve selecting a connected dominating set
   used to forward multicast messages to all nodes in an administrative
   domain.  However, existing mechanisms often require two-hop topology
   information, which is more state than a LLN node may be able to
   handle.

   This document describes the use of Trickle for IPv6 multicast
   forwarding in LLNs.  Trickle provides a mechanism for controlled,
   density-aware flooding without the need to maintain a forwarding
   topology [I-D.levis-roll-trickle].

2.  Terminology

   Trickle Multicast Message  A IPv6 multicast datagram that includes a
                       Trickle Multicast option in the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop
                       Options header.

   Trickle Multicast Forwarder  A IPv6 router that can process a Trickle
                       Multicast option and follows the forwarding rules
                       specified in this document.

   Trickle Multicast Domain  An administrative domain that defines the
                       scope of Trickle dissemination.  All routers
                       within a Trickle Multicast Domain participate in
                       the same dissemination process.

   Seed                The router that starts the dissemination process
                       for a Trickle multicast message.  The Seed may be
                       different than the node identified by the IPv6
                       Source address of the multicast message.

3.  Overview

   Trickle multicast forwarding implements a controlled, density-aware
   flood to disseminate a IPv6 multicast message to all nodes within a
   Trickle Multicast Domain.  The basic process is similar to
   traditional flooding - nodes forward newly received multicast
   messages using link-layer broadcasts.  Nodes maintain state of
   recently received multicast messages to detect duplicates and ensure
   that each node receives at most one copy of each multicast message.

   Each Trickle multicast message carries a Trickle Multicast option
   that includes a SeedID and Sequence value.  The SeedID uniquely
   identifies the Seed that initiated the message's dissemination
   process within the Trickle Multicast Domain.  Note that the Seed does
   not have to be the same node as the message's source.  It is possible
   to tunnel a multicast message to a Seed node and start the
   dissemination process from a different node within the Trickle
   Multicast Domain.

   The Sequence value establishes a total ordering of multicast messages
   disseminated by SeedID.  Nodes maintain a sliding window of recently
   received multicast messages for each SeedID.  The sliding window
   establishes what messages can be received and ensure at most one copy
   of each multicast message is received.  Messages with sequence values
   lower than the lower bound of the window MUST be ignored.  Messages
   with sequence values stored within the sliding window MUST be
   ignored.  All other messages MUST be received, advancing the sliding
   window if necessary.  Larger sequence values always take precedence.
   The sliding window can be of variable size, trading memory
   requirements for reliability of disseminating multiple messages
   simultaneously.

   Trickle's density-aware properties come from its suppression
   mechanism.  When suppression is enabled, nodes periodically advertise
   a summary of recently received multicast messages.  These
   advertisements allow nodes to determine if they have any additional
   multicasts to offer to neighboring nodes.  A multicast message is
   only retransmitted upon receiving positive indication that a neighbor
   has not yet received that multicast message.

   Nodes suppress advertisement transmissions and multicast
   retransmissions after recently receiving "consistent" advertisements.
   A node determines that a neighbor's advertisement is "consistent"
   when neither node has new multicast messages to offer to the other.
   The suppression reduces the number of redundant transmissions and is
   what allows Trickle to maintain low channel utilization in dense
   environments.  However, suppression trades low control overhead for
   longer propagation times.  When using suppression, Trickle's

Internet-Draft        Trickle Multicast Forwarding          January 2011


   propagation times often have a long-tail distribution.

   Trickle provides an adaptive timer, called the Trickle timer.  When
   receiving an "inconsistent" advertisement, nodes reset the Trickle
   timer period to a small period so that dissemination happens quickly.
   The Trickle timer period doubles when the period expires and no
   "inconsistent" advertisements have been received, reducing control
   overhead when the network is in a consistent state.

   This document does allow configurations that disable the suppression
   mechanism, reducing Trickle Multicast Forwarding to simple flooding.
   This can be done by setting the suppression threshold for received
   "consistent" advertisements to infinity.  In this mode, Trickle
   advertisements are not sent since consistency checks are not
   performed.  Instead, nodes simply retransmit multicast messages they
   are trying to forward.

4.  Trickle Multicast Parameters

   All Trickle multicast forwarders within a Trickle multicast domain
   MUST be configured with two sets of configurations (one for each
   value of the M flag).  Each configuration has five parameters:

   Imin                The minimum Trickle timer interval as defined in
                       [I-D.levis-roll-trickle].

   Imax                The maximum Trickle timer interval as defined in
                       [I-D.levis-roll-trickle].

   k                   The redundancy constant as defined in
                       [I-D.levis-roll-trickle].

   Tactive             The duration that a multicast forwarder can
                       attempt to forward a multicast message.
                       Specified in units of Imax.

   Tdwell              The duration that a multicast forwarder must
                       maintain sliding window state for SeedID after
                       receiving the last multicast message from SeedID.
                       Specified in units of Imax.

   Tactive specifies the time duration that a node may retransmit a
   multicast message in attempt to forward it to neighboring nodes.
   Larger values of Tactive increases the number of retransmissions and
   overall dissemination reliability.

   Tdwell specifies the time duration for maintaining sliding window
   state to ensure that a multicast message from SeedID is received at
   most once.  Larger values of Tdwell decreases the likelihood that a
   node will receive a multicast message more than once.

   The specific values are left out of scope of this document as they
   are dependent on link-specific properties.  How those parameters are
   configured are also left out of scope.

   The Trickle multicast parameters allow both aggressive and
   conservative multicast forwarding strategies.  For example, an
   aggressive strategy may specify each multicast forwarder to
   retransmit any newly received message 3 times on a short fixed period
   and maintain state for 12 retransmission periods to avoid receiving
   duplicate messages.  This aggressive policy can be specified using a
   Trickle parameter set of Imin = Imax = 100ms, k = infinity, Tactive =
   3, and Tdwell = 12.  Setting k to infinity disables the Trickle
   suppression mechanism.

   A conservative multicast forwarding strategy utilizes Trickle
   suppression and a larger Imax value to minimize redundant
   transmissions.  One such conservative policy is a Trickle parameter
   set of Imin = 100ms, Imax = 30min, k = 1, Tactive = 3, and Tdwell =
   12.

5.  Message Formats

5.1.  Trickle Multicast Option

   The Trickle Multicast option is carried in an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options
   header, immediately following the IPv6 header.  The Trickle Multicast
   option has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
                                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                     |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |       SeedID (optional)       |M|          Sequence           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Option Type         XX (to be confirmed by IANA).

   Opt Data Len        Length of the Option Data field in octets.  MUST
                       be set to either 2 or 4.

   SeedID              Uniquely identifies a Trickle multicast seed that
                       initiated the dissemination process.  The SeedID
                       field is optional and only appears when Opt Data
                       Len is set to 4.  When Opt Data Len is set to 2,
                       the SeedID is equivalent to the IPv6 Source
                       address.

   M                   Mode flag.  Identifies one of two Trickle
                       parameters to use when forwarding this multicast
                       message.

   Sequence            Identifies relative ordering of multicast
                       messages from the source identified by SeedID.

   The Option Data of the Trickle Multicast option MUST NOT change en-
   route.  Nodes that do not understand the Trickle Multicast option
   MUST skip over this option and continue processing the header.  Thus,
   according to [RFC2460] the three high order bits of the Option Type
   must be equal set to zero.  The Option Data length is variable.

   The SeedID uniquely identifies a Trickle multicast seed within the
   Trickle multicast domain.  The SeedID field may either be an IPv6
   address assigned to the seed node or a managed 16-bit value.  In
   either case, the SeedID MUST be unique within the Trickle multicast
   domain.  Managing the SeedID namespace is left out of scope.

   The M flag identifies one of two Trickle parameters to use when
   forwarding the message.  This capability allows a Trickle Multicast
   Domain to support two different Trickle parameter sets that make
   different propagation time vs. control overhead trade-offs.

   Sequence establishes a relative ordering of multicast messages from
   the same SeedID.  The source MUST increment the Sequence value when
   sourcing a new Trickle multicast message.  Implementations MUST
   follow the Serial Number Arithmetic as defined in [RFC1982].

5.2.  Trickle ICMPv6 Message

   The Trickle ICMP message is used to advertise metadata for recently
   received Trickle multicast messages.  The Trickle ICMP message has
   the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   IP Fields:

   Source Address      A link-local address assigned to the sending
                       interface.

   Destination Address The link-local all-nodes (FF02::1) or link-local
                       all-routers (FF02::2) multicast address.

   Sequence List[1..n] List of zero, one, or more Sequence Lists
                       (defined in Section 5.2.1).

   The Trickle ICMP message advertises sliding windows maintained by the
   multicast forwarder.  The advertisement serves to notify neighbors of
   newer messages that it can propagate or has yet to receive.  Only
   entries for messages where Tactive has not expired are included in
   the ICMP message.  The sliding windows are encoded using a Sequence
   List, defined in Section 5.2.1.

5.2.1.  Sequence List

   A Sequence List contains a list of Sequence values for a SeedID.
   Each Sequence List has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |                                                               |
     .                       Sequence[1..SeqLen]                     .
     .                                                               .
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   S                   Indicates length of SeedID.  When set to 0,
                       SeedID is 16 octets.  When set to 1, SeedID is 2
                       octets.

   M                   Indicates one of two Trickle parameter sets used
                       for disseminating multicast messages.

   SeqLen              Number of 2-octet Sequence entries.

   SeedID              Copied from a recently received Trickle Multicast
                       option.

   Sequence[1..SeqLen] List of recently received Sequence values from
                       SeedID.  Note that the Sequence value is only 15
                       bits and the highest order bit MUST be set to 0.

6.  Trickle Multicast Forwarder Behavior

   A Trickle Multicast Forwarder implementation needs to manage sliding
   windows and Trickle timers.  These mechanisms are used to determine
   when received messages should be accepted, when ICMP messages are
   transmitted, and when multicast messages are retransmitted.

6.1.  Managing Sliding Windows

   Every Trickle multicast forwarder MUST maintain a sliding window of
   Sequence values for each SeedID that generated recently received
   multicast messages.

   When receiving a Trickle multicast message, if no existing sliding
   window exists for the SeedID, a new sliding window MUST be created
   before accepting the message.  If memory constraints are such that a
   new sliding window cannot be created, then the message must be
   ignored.

   If a sliding window exists for the SeedID, the message must be
   ignored if the message's Sequence value falls below the lower bound
   of the window or appears in the list of stored Sequence values within
   the window.  All other messages MUST be received.

   When receiving a message, the sliding window MUST be updated with the
   message's Sequence value.  If the Sequence value is larger than the
   upper bound of the window, the new message establishes the new upper
   bound.

   Memory constraints may limit the total number of Sequence values that
   can be stored.  An entry may be reclaimed before the dwell time
   expires if it serves as the lower bound of the window and the window
   has more than one entry.  Note that entries can be reclaimed from
   sliding windows for other SeedIDs.

   When only one entry for a sliding window remains, that entry MUST NOT
   be reclaimed until its dwell timer expires.  Maintaining the largest
   sequence value received from a SeedID ensures that earlier messages
   are received at most once.

6.2.  Trickle Timers

   A Trickle multicast forwarder maintains two Trickle timers
   parameterized on the S flag.  The Trickle timer is maintained as
   described in [I-D.levis-roll-trickle].

   When suppression is enabled (i.e. k is finite), a Trickle
   transmission event consists of transmitting a Trickle ICMP message.

   If an "inconsistent" advertisement was received during that period,
   multicast messages that caused the inconsistency are also
   retransmitted.

   When suppression is disabled (i.e. k is infinite), a Trickle
   transmission event consists of transmitting multicast messages that
   have been received within the Tactive time window.

   This document defines receiving a "consistent" transmission as
   receiving a Trickle ICMP message that indicates neither the receiving
   nor transmitting node has new multicast messages to offer.

   This document defines receiving an "inconsistent" transmission as
   receiving a Trickle ICMP message that indicates either receiving or
   transmitting node has a new multicast message to offer.  An
   "inconsistent" transmission also includes receiving a new multicast
   message.

6.3.  Trickle Multicast Option Processing

   All IPv6 datagrams containing a Trickle Multicast option MUST have a
   multicast IPv6 Destination address.  If the IPv6 Destination is not a
   multicast address, the multicast forwarder MUST drop the datagram.

   A multicast forwarder MUST drop the multicast message if it cannot
   ensure that the message has never been received before.  This occurs
   when the Sequence value is below the lower bound of the sliding
   window for SeedID or when an entry already exists for the Sequence
   value.

   If no sliding window state for SeedID exists, the multicast forwarder
   MUST allocate a new sliding window for the SeedID before accepting
   the message.  If a sliding window cannot be allocated, the forwarder
   MUST drop the message.

   Upon accepting the message, the forwarder MUST enter the sequence
   value in the sliding window and decrement the IPv6 Hop Limit.  If the
   IPv6 Hop Limit is non-zero, the forwarder MUST buffer the message for
   retransmission for the duration specified by Tactive.

6.4.  Trickle ICMP Processing

   Processing a Trickle ICMP message involves determining if either the
   receiver or transmitter has new multicast messages to offer.

   The transmitter has new multicast messages to offer if any (SeedID,
   Sequence) pair falls within an existing sliding window for SeedID but
   does not have an associated entry.

   The transmitter has new multicast messages to offer if the (SeedID,
   Sequence) pair is great than the upper bound of an existing sliding
   window for SeedID.

   The receiver has new multicast messages to offer if any buffered
   messages are not listed in the Trickle ICMP message and the Trickle
   ICMP message contains a (SeedID, Sequence) pair for a prior multicast
   message.

   The receiver has a new multicast message to offer if any buffered
   messages does not have an associated SeedID entry in the Trickle ICMP
   message.

   If neither receiver nor transmitter has new multicast messages to
   offer, the multicast forwarder logs a consistent event by
   incrementing c, as described in [I-D.levis-roll-trickle].

   If either receiver or transmitter has new multicast messages to
   offer, the multicast forwarder logs an inconsistent event by
   resetting Trickle timer T[M], as described in
   [I-D.levis-roll-trickle].  All new messages that the receiver can
   offer MUST be scheduled for transmission at the next transmission
   event.  Note that these transmissions may be suppressed if the
   transmission event is suppressed.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The Trickle Multicast option requires an IPv6 Option Number.



   HEX         act  chg  rest
   ---         ---  ---  -----
     C          00    0  01100



   The first two bits indicate that the IPv6 node may skip over this
   option and continue processing the header if it doesn't recognize the
   option type, and the third bit indicates that the Option Data MUST
   NOT change en-route.

Abstract

   The concepts in this document are based on work on
   Q.Flowstatesig in the ITU SG11/Q5. Flow State Aware Signaling
   has been worked on in the ITU for the past 13 years. However,
   this document stands on its own since no IETF compatible format
   has yet been adopted. The goal of this protocol is to provide
   (1) a technique to have network nodes provide available rate
   flows (like TCP) rapid and periodic feedback to the sender as to
   the maximum rate they should send and (2) to provide network
   feedback to fixed rate flows (like UDP voice) if the peak rate
   they require can be statistically assured. Network traffic using
   this protocol should experience reduced response time, less
   queuing delay and less packet discards. The use of this protocol
   is limited to bounded subnets at the network edge and is to be
   converted to and from standard IP flows at the subnet
   boundaries.

1. Introduction

   Today many of the applications on the Internet would operate
   better if there were no discards, delay, or rate variation for
   the packet flow. Overcapacity is one way to achieve this but at
   the network edge this is often much too expensive since TCP will
   expand to fill most any link bandwidth. At that edge each TCP
   flow is normally controlled by adding delay and random discards,
   generally using RED or simple tail drop. With current technology
   the network cannot provide feedback to the sending process as to
   what rate each individual flow can operate at to achieve its
   desired QoS with minimal delay and no packet discards. That is
   the goal of this protocol.

   This document describes a Flow State Aware (FSA) protocol that
   allows network nodes along the path of a data flow provide
   feedback to the Sender as to the transmission rate the network
   can support. There are two rates negotiated between the Sender
   and all the network nodes in the flow path; an available rate
   (AR) updated periodically and a guaranteed peek rate (GR) which
   is good for the duration of the flow. These rates are used to
   define four services. To determine these rates and the related
   QoS parameters, the Sender sends a signaling packet requesting
   the rates and QoS desired for a flow. Each network node on the
   path can reduce the rates and other QoS parameters to rates and
   QoS that node can support. When the signaling packet arrives at
   the destination, it is returned to the Sender. The Sender can
   then send the data flow at the signaled rates. The Sender also
   must send additional requests periodically so that the rates can
   be updated as the network load changes or if path failures
   occur. An example is in Figure 1 below where the Sender requests
   the maximum rate his computer can send, the first Net-Node marks
   that down to 10 Mbps and the next Net-Node marks that down to 5
   Mbps. When the QoS Structure arrives at the Receiver it returns
   it to the Sender (not necessarily on the same path). Upon
   receiving the 5 Mbps rate in a response, the Sender can jump to
   that rate for the delivery of the flow.

   This process requires that signaling packets follow the same
   path as the data flow packets so that the feedback is from the
   nodes on the path. Thus, the requirement is to use inband
   signaling, not out-of-band signaling.

   Although this process requires a new function at each network
   node, it need not be integrated into the routers; it can be
   added as separate inline traffic management card or system. The
   task of examining about 7% of the packets and marking them if
   necessary is easily accomplished today at 10 Gbps line rates.
   Since the process would be far more difficult at 100 Gbps today
   it should not be expected to be supported in the core, rather it
   is being specified to be restricted to bounded subnets at the
   network edge.

    2.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that
   interpretation only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these
   words are not to be    interpreted as carrying RFC-2119
   significance.

    2.2. Definitions

  1. Sender: A Sender is the process where data flows are
    encapsulated to transit a bounded subnet. The Sender process
    accepts standard IP as input and encapsulates each TCP or UDP
    flow with a GRE-FSA header and inserts Flow State Aware (FSA)
    signaling messages as necessary into the encapsulated stream.
    It also manages the sending rate as indicated by the FSA
    signaling feedback. All other IP traffic is forwarded without
    encapsulation.

  2. Receiver: A Receiver is the process which receives traffic
    from the bounded subnet, interprets the signaling messages,
    returns encapsulated signaling responses, and de-encapsulates

    the data flows. It then outputs standard IP to the network or
    computer on the outside of the bounded subnet.

  3. Proxy: A Proxy is a process or system which contains both a
    Sender and a Receiver. It is used to separate a bounded subnet
    from standard IP networks. On the side toward the bounded
    subnet (the FSA side)it sends and receives encapsulated TCP
    and UDP flows. On the side away from the bounded subnet (the
    IP side), it sends and receives standard IP.

  4. End-system: A End-system is either a user's computing device
    or a server which incorporates the Sender and Receiver
    functions.

  5. Net-Node process: A Net-Node process is the network process
    that examines all GRE-FSA Encapsulated packets and, if they
    are marked as containing signaling, the signaling is processed
    and, if necessary, modified to lower the rates or QoS such
    that the flow can be supported with minimal delay and no
    discards at that network node.

  6. Bounded Subnet: A section of IP network totally bounded by
    proxies or End-systems and where all the network nodes support
    Net-Node processes.

  7. QoS Structure: A 16 byte block, used in packets marked as
    signaling packets that contains the rates and QoS parameters
    which are to be negotiated with the Net-Nodes.

  8. Available Rate Service (ARS): A transport service primarily
    for applications that can flexibly adapt to the current
    available capacity and can quickly adjust their sending rate
    as the available capacity changes.

  9. Variable Rate Service (VRS): A transport service for
    applications that want an AR service and can flexibly take
    advantage of additional available capacity, but requires a
    minimum capacity.
  10. Maximum Rate Service (MRS): A transport service for streaming
    applications that internally control their peak rate and need
    a fixed maximum rate path where they will experience minimal
    discards or delays.

  11. Guaranteed Rate Service (GRS): A transport service for
    applications that require guaranteed bandwidth for the
    duration of the flow.
  12. State Timeout Timer (STT): STT is the maximum time that is
    allowed between two packets before the flow state should be
    dropped. The STT default value is 2 seconds.
  13. Response Timeout period (RTO): RTO is the time to wait for a
    Response to a Request or Close packet before retransmitting
    the Request or Close. The RTO default value is 1 second.
  14. Response Timeout Count (RTC) is a counter that is decremented
    every time a response time out (RTO) occurs. The default RTC
    is 3.
  15. Flow Sender Depth (FSD): When there are FSA subnets like a
    satellite link inside a FSA subnet it is important to not
    double encapsulate the packets. Therefore each QoS Structure
    contains a Flow Sender Depth (FSD) which is incremented by one
    when encountering the IP side of a Proxy and decremented by 1
    when encountering the FSA side of a proxy. When FSD>1 no
    encapsulation or de-encapsulation should occur.
  16. Error Rate Threshold (ERT): ERT is a parameter in a Sender
    which, if exceeded, causes the Sender to drop out of the FSA
    protocol and send the remainder of the flow as standard IP.
    The default ERT is 2% packet loss but can be set higher if
    there is a known noisy link in the forward path.
  17. NormPriority: NormPriority is the highest priority value that can
    be authorized without sender authentication. The priority field is
    8 bits with the highest value being the leftmost bit. The default
    value of NormPriority is 0010000 or 1/8 of the range which with 5
    bit priorities allows 4 values for the average user.

      2.3. General Principles

   The Internet has progressed today to support much higher speeds
   and volumes of traffic but it still it suffers from delay, delay
   jitter and packet discards at the edges where the rates must be
   controlled. This has little effect on bulk file transfers but
   for interactive applications it would be valuable to eliminate
   these artifacts. This protocol allows these problems to be
   virtually eliminated as traffic transits the edge. The

   technology to support this protocol was not economic a decade
   ago but with today's low cost of memory and processing it is
   quite economic to support the required functions. It is to be
   expected that the introduction of FSA technology will be slowly
   adopted as the needs dictate. Therefore, it should be carefully
   limited to bounded subnets and support simple interworking with
   IP networks that do not support FSA signaling.

   For example, one application of FSA technology could be to
   include Proxy software in DSL or Cable modems, place a Net-Node
   process on the network side of the DSLAM or CMTS systems, along
   with another Proxy to remove signaling just before the core
   network. Thus a single POP might be upgraded to eliminate the
   discards and delay introduced at the user edge, allowing smooth
   managed flows to move from the core to the users modem and thus
   into his LAN. Since neither the users LAN nor the core network
   is likely to need to further reduce the flow rates, the
   interactive response time, speed, and throughput would be
   significantly improved for users within that POP.

   Another possible use of FSA technology is in optimizing the
   throughput, reducing delay, and eliminating discards as IP
   traffic transits a long haul trunk between two higher bandwidth
   networks. Examples are satellite links, trans-ocean cables, and
   limited capacity international links. TCP would normally slow
   down considerably when encountering the long haul delay and have
   long periods to recover from discarded packets. However, with
   Proxies at either end and a Net-Node system at one end, TCP
   would not be impacted seriously by the added delay and would
   avoid needing to recover from discards. Due to the ability to
   jump to its allocated rate after one round trip it would not be
   impacted by the long delay even when a packet was lost due to
   noise. Also the throughput would not be limited by the WAN link
   delay.

   Thus the goal of this document is to introduce a protocol that
   can be implemented incrementally into sections of any IP network
   as economics and demand dictate. By encapsulating the traffic
   within a new GRE-FSA header between Proxies or End Systems it is
   intended that there would be no adverse impact on any network
   equipment or end system. The reason for this Internet Draft is
   to see if the IETF can see any potential problems that might
   have adverse impact to the network or users.

   If for any reason there is a system within a bounded subnet
   which is not behind a proxy and does not have a FSA supported
   End-system, the encapsulated packets would be discarded as

   unknown. The design is such that if the Sender does not receive
   a response to his initial request, the Sender will revert to
   standard IP, thereby continuing without any adverse effect
   except to lose the benefits of the FSA Protocol.

3. FSA Protocol

   The following is a specification of the FSA protocol. It is
   intended as a short but complete specification.

      3.1.  Sender Process

   The job of a Sender is to encapsulate TCP and UDP flows within a
   GRE-FSA header, inserting where appropriate signaling packets
   carrying QoS Structures. Packets which contain QoS Structures
   MUST be marked as signaling packets. The Encapsulation is in a
   GRE protocol packet. This packet format is a standard IP header
   with GRE specified as the protocol. The first 4 byte word after
   the IP header is is the GRE header which contains an Ethertype
   indicating FSA protocol as obtained from the IEEE. Currently
   Ethertype 0x22EF has been obtained for this protocol. The first
   2 bytes in the GRE header is set to zero. The 4 byte work after
   the GRE header is the FSA header and it contains a signaling bit
   S, the protocol code (TCP or UDP) of the flow, and a word offset
   to the first QoS Structure, if any. The S bit MUST be zero for
   non-signaling packets and MUST be one for signaling packets. As
   the GRE and FSA headers allways occur together, the pair will be
   called the GRE-FSA header.
 
               3.1.1. Signaling Requests

   When the Sender detects a new flow (where the addresses, ports,
   and protocol are not the same as any current flow), the Sender
   MUST encapsulate each data packet underneath a copy of the
   packets IP header but with the Protocol or Next Header set to
   GRE followed by a GRE-FSA header. 

   The GRE-FSA header MUST be marked as a signaling packet (S=1).
   Following the GRE-FSA header should be the TCP or UDP header. 
   Next a QoS Structure should be affixed to the end of the packet.
   The QoS structure should contain the desired service type,
   rates, and other QoS parameters and is marked as a Request
   packet.

   For TCP the first packet, marked a Request signaling packet, MAY
   serve both as the data SYN and the Request. If a separate packet
   is used, the SYN bit and the ACK bit in the signaling packets
   TCP header MUST be set to zero to indicate that it is not to be

Internet-Draft        Flow State Aware Signaling               Nov 2010


   forwarded by the Receiver. For UDP the FSA Request signaling
   packet is always a separate packet.

   When the Sender is sending encapsulated TCP it expects that all
   the Net-Nodes along the path are adjusting the rate (AR) such
   that none of the Net-Nodes will need to discard packets from the
   flow due to congestion. Thus, any lost packets are expected to
   be due to transmission problems. Therefore the Sender SHOULD
   continue sending at the designated rate even if packets are
   lost. The standard TCP retransmission of lost packets will
   correct the transmission losses.

   It may be possible that one network node along the flow path has
   not properly implemented the Net-Node processing and starts
   discarding packets. To ensure that the traffic is not harmed
   excessively at that node, each Sender SHOULD monitor the packet
   loss rate and if it exceeds an Error Rate Threshold (ERT), the
   Sender SHOULD stop encapsulating the flow and continue with the
   flow as standard IP. If the path is known to be across a known
   noisy link, the ERT setting should be set slightly higher than
   the known packet loss rate.

   In the case of a Proxy, it is taking in IP packets and sending
   forward FSA encapsulated packets and the necessary signaling
   packets. However, if the incoming packets include FSA Signaling
   packets, then it should increase the Flow Sender Depth (FSD) by
   1 and just forward the packets without encapsulating them again.
   This allows there to be FSA subnets imbedded within a larger FSA
   subnet.

   If no Response packet is received after a Request is made within
   a Response Timeout period (RTO) from the Request time, then the
   Sender MUST retry up to two more times sending Request packets.
   If after three tries, no Response is received, the FSA SHOULD
   send a close packet (to notify the Net-Nodes) and then send the
   data flow with no encapsulation and no signaling packets.

               3.1.2. Data Transfer and Signaling Renegotiates

   Once a Response is received, the Sender should proceed to
   encapsulate and send the packets of the data flow with S set to
   zero indicating non-signaling. For UDP flows, data packets MAY
   be sent between the Request and when the Response is received
   but these packets are at risk of being discarded since no rate
   has yet been agreed.

Internet-Draft        Flow State Aware Signaling               Nov 2010


   Renegotiate Signaling packets MUST be inserted into the data
   flow periodically. After sending a Request packet, the Sender
   MUST send a renegotiate packet after 1 second or after 16
   packets whichever is earlier. After that the Sender MUST insert
   Renegotiate packets after one second or every 128 packets,
   whichever is earlier. The Renegotiate packets allow the Net-
   Nodes to re-determine the rate for ARS and VRS higher or lower,
   depending on network load. For MRS and GRS the renegotiate acts
   as a keep alive with the Net-Nodes and allows them to, in
   unusual circumstances such as trunk failures, to slow the flow
   or even to terminate the flow (rate=0). Since Renegotiate
   signaling packets would add 24 bytes to a data packet which
   might exceed the maximum size, they should be sent as separate
   packets, using the IP header from one of the flows data packets
   but with the protocol set to GRE followed by the IP and TCP or
   UDP headers of the prior packet but with no data section. The
   QoS Structure should be attached at the end. The Receiver will
   delete these separate signaling packets from the output TCP or
   UDP flow.

   The receiver at the Sender's site will be receiving the
   Responses sent from the remote Receiver. If a Response has the
   protocol TCP and SYN=1 or ACK=1 in the TCP header, the rates and
   QoS should be applied to the sender's parameters and the
   encapsulated TCP SYN/ACK or ACK packet should be extracted and
   sent to the output stream. If alternatively SYN=ACK=0 then the
   rates and QoS should be applied to the sender's parameters and
   the packet discarded.

      3.2. Receiver Process

   The Receiver is the other half of the Sender process. It
   receives and responds to the FSA Signaling commands and extracts
   the encapsulated data flow. The extracted data flow is then
   forwarded to its output, typically the next stage of the network
   or the Receivers computer.

   When the Receiver process receives a Request signaling packet it
   will have the rate that the Sender should send at. Unless the
   FSD counter is greater than one the Receiver SHOULD pass the QoS
   Structure back to the Sender by constructing a Signaling packet
   marked as Response. The Response SHOULD have the QoS Structure
   parameters AR, GR, PP, DP, TP, and BT exactly as received. FSD
   SHOULD be set to one and CD set to Response. If the Receiver has
   local limitations on the rate it can receive which are less than
   the AR+GR rate specified in the QoS Structure, it SHOULD reduce
   the rates to its own limit.

Internet-Draft        Flow State Aware Signaling               Nov 2010


   For a Response signaling packet where the protocol is TCP, the
   Receiver MAY attach a second QoS Structure to the bottom of the
   packet to specify its own Forward rate and QoS request. The
   Receiver should mark CH bit 2 of the first QoS structure to a 1
   to indicate there is a second QoS Structure. Then the packet is
   returned.

   If a TCP Request or Renegotiate signaling packet has the SYN bit
   set in the TCP header and the Flow Sender Depth (FSD) is one,
   the GRE delivery IP header, the GRE-FSA header, and the QoS
   Structure(s) SHOULD be removed and the remaining TCP SYN packet
   sent forward as a data packet. Similarly, if a receiver receives
   a TCP Response packet with the ACK bit set and FSD=1 it should
   strip the encapsulation and QoS Structure and forward the TCP
   SYN/ACK or ACK packet as a data packet.

   If a Signaling packet has FSD>1, the receiver should decrease
   FSD by 1 and forward the packet without de-encapsulating it,
   to the output data stream.

   All encapsulated data packets (S=0) SHOULD be de-encapsulated
   (removing the GRE-FSA header and moving the flow protocol to
   the IP header) and forwarded to the output data stream except
   when the first Signaling packet has had FSD>1.

      3.3. Termination of the Flow

   When a Sender receives no more data packets as part of a flow
   for the State Timeout Timer period (STT) then the Sender should
   consider this flow terminated and close out its state.


      3.4. Net-Node Process

   Each network node within a bounded subnet where branching occurs
   needs to have a Net-Node process. The Net-Node should police all
   flows to ensure they do not violate the rules they have agreed
   to. It also needs to keep track of the total traffic which is on
   the trunk or trunks it is managing. This is typical operation
   for a traffic manager.

               3.4.1. Net-Node Recognition of Flows

   When a GRE-FSA packet is received, the Net-Node needs to collect
   the two addresses from the encapsulated IP header, the protocol
   from the FSA header, and the two port fields from the first 4
   bytes of the TCP or UDP header. These 5 fields uniquely identify

   the flow. They can be hashed to aid in the flow lookup. This
   process will identify the signaling packets and the datapackets
   as the same flow.

               3.4.2. Net-Node Processing of Signaling Packets

   The new task is to watch for FSA Signaling packets. They will be
   GRE packets with Ethertype FSA and have the S field in the FSA
   header set to 1. For these packets it needs to examine the QoS
   Structure and see if they are on the forward path which is true
   if the CD field is odd (CD=1,5,7). For CD=even (2) they should
   just be forwarded. For CD=1 or 5 the rates and QoS requests
   should be examined to see if the rates can be supported given
   the QoS request. If they can be supported within the available
   capacity on their path then the packet should be forwarded
   untouched. If the rates must be reduced to fit within the
   available capacity, the rates should be reduced as needed. Also
   if the QoS must be changed for this path, the relevant QoS
   parameter should be reduced. If either change is made, the
   Modify bit (M) should be set to one. For forward signaling
   packets, changed or not, the rates agreed to should be saved for
   policing the flow. For CD=7 (Close) the FSA state SHOULD be
   deleted.

   For all FSA flows, if there is a gap between packets of STT
   seconds then the Net-Nodes MAY drop the flow state for that
   flow.

   It might seem that all Net-Nodes would need to know the final
   rates and QoS agreed to but this is unnecessary. The Net-Nodes
   are not reserving capacity as wasted bandwidth, they are only
   policing and adjusting flow rates dynamically to ensure a modest
   safety margin. If node 1 has passed a request which asked for 10
   Mbps and node 2 reduced the rate to 5 Mbps, node 2 will be
   policing the flow to 5 Mbps if necessary. Actually the Sender
   will be sending at <=5 Mbps unless miss-configured. If the flow
   is sent at 7 Mbps, node 1 will not police the flow, but Node 2
   will police it. The same concept is true for closing flow state,
   since all systems (Sender, Receiver, and Net-Nodes) will drop
   the flow state 2 seconds after the final packet.

4. Data Structures

      4.1. Data Packet Structure

   The data structure for a non-signaling encapsulated packet
   follows: The delivery Header is a GRE IP header which is an
   exact copy of the encapsulated packets IP header except that the
   IPv4 protocol or IPv6 Next Header is changed to GRE. The GRE-FSA
   header follows the Delivery header. The data packet less the IP
   header follows the GRE-FSA header.

   The GRE-FSA header length is 8 bytes. The GRE-FSA header has the
   form:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   The first two bytes are GRE defined flags and a 3 bit Version
   field. They should all be set to zero, completing the GRE
   defined header. Following this is the FSA header, starting with
   the S (Signaling) bit. The 6th byte is the protocol of the flow,
   originally in the IP header. It should be TCP or UDP. The 7th 
   and 8th bytes is the number of 4 byte words before the first
   QoS structure, if a signaling packet, set to zero for data 
   packets. This allows quick access to the QoS information.

      4.2.  Signaling packets

   A Signaling packet consists of an IP delivery header which is a
   copy of the data packets IP header but with the protocol or Next
   Header set to GRE (47). It is followed by a GRE-FSA header with
   S=1. After the GRE-FSA header comes the TCP or UDP headers of  
   the data packet. At the end the 16 byte QoS Structure is
   affixed.

   The QoS Fields in a QoS Structure are as follows:

   Reserved2: (32 bits) Reserved and set to 0.

   AR: (16 bits) Available Rate - floating point rate as described
   in section 4.4 for network assigned rates e.g. as used for TCP
   traffic.

   GR: (16 bits) Guaranteed Rate - floating point rate as described
   in section 4.4 for user specified fixed rate traffic (GRS, MGS,
   and the minimum rate of VRS) - this is the peak rate allowed.

   PP: (8 bits) Preference Priority - indicates a relative rate
   priority for AR and VR and an acceptance priority for MR and GR
   flows - 64 levels - 0=lowest, 63=highest in the high order 6
   bits (bits 0-5).  The two low order bits are reserved and should
   be set to 0.

   DP: (8 bits) Delay Priority in 64 levels. - 0=lowest priority,
   63=highest priority. The highest level gets priority in
   transmission reducing delay and delay variation.

   CD: (4 bits) Change/Direction field - Bit 0: set to zero, Bits
   1-3: 0= No action required, 1=Request at the start of a flow to
   negotiate the QoS parameters, 2= Response returning agreed
   parameters to the Sender, 3=Reserved, 4=Reserved, 5=Renegotiate,
   a sender request to renegotiate rates on the continuation of a
   flow. 6=Reserved, 7=Close, sent by Sender to close out Net-Nodes
   state.

   TP: (4 bits) Bits 0-1: Reserved and set to zero; Bits 2-3: Type
   of flow - 0=Available Rate Service (ARS), 1=Variable Rate
   Service (VRS) composite rate where GR is requested as a fixed
   minimum and AR is additional bandwidth assigned by the network,
   2=Maximum Rate Service (MRS), 3=Guaranteed Rate Service (GRS).

   CH: (4 bits) Bit 2: Second QoS Attached, 0 = single QoS
   Structure, 1 = Second QoS Structure follows; Bit 3: Security
   Structure attached, 0 = No Security Structure follows, 1 =
   Security Structure follows.

   BT: (4 bits) Burst Tolerance - the time (at approved rate) a
   flow is permitted to exceed its rate (GR+AR) before packets are
   discarded. Time=2^ (-BT-1) seconds (15 microseconds to 500 ms).

   QoS Version: (12 bits) QoS Protocol Version Field - set to 1.

Internet-Draft        Flow State Aware Signaling               Nov 2010


   M: (4 bits) Bit 3: Modified marker. Set to 0 by Sender on
   Request or Renegotiate. Set to 1 by Net-Nodes if any field
   changed during a request or renegotiate; Bits 0-2: Flow Sender
   Depth (FSD) - Set to 1 by Sender, increased by one entering a
   proxy and decremented by one when leaving a proxy.

   Reserved3: (16 bits) Reserved and set to 0


      4.4. Floating Point Rates

    The AR and GR rates are passed as 16 bit floating point
    numbers.

    . The most significant bit of AR and GR is zero and reserved
    . The next bit is nz where nz=1 indicates if the number non-
      zero and nz=0 means the number is zero.
    . The next 5 bits of AR and GR are the exponent E,
    . The next 9 bits are the mantissa M.
    . The rates AR or GR= (1+M/512)*2^E kilobits per second.
    . All zero is interpreted as zero.
    . Rates are in kilobits per second.
    . Since E can be as large as 31 and M 511, the maximum rate is
      4.291 Tbps. The lowest rate would be 1 Kbps since 0 is zero.
    . Rates are to be measured based on averaging over the Burst
      Tolerance time. The default Burst Tolerance is 1/2 second which
      means the rate may peak higher momentarily but policing will
      occur only if the 1/2 second average exceeds the rate agreed
      to.
    . The rate is measured using all the bytes in the IP packet
      including the delivery header and GRE header.


      4.5. FSA Sender Depth (FSD)

   In some cases, there may be bounded subnets inside bounded
   subnets. To protect against errors which would otherwise occur
   in this case, any Sender that receives signaling packets on its
   IP input side, would assume it is an inner subnet and should
   only add 1 to FSD rather than creating signal packets and
   setting FSD to 1. It should remember that the flow has FSD>1
   and pass GRE-FSA data packets without encapsulating them.
   Receivers who receive a signaling packet on the FSA side with
   FSD >1 should reduce FSD by 1 and not de-encapsulate the packets
   or delete the signaling packets. If instead, FSD=1 when 
   received, the Receiver should remove all the encapsulation, drop
   stand alone signaling packets, and delete all QoS Structures.

   5. Security Considerations

   This protocol might be attacked in many ways. Taking them one at
   a time:

   . An attacker might attempt to use a priority that was higher
     than others were using. Therefore, all priorities higher than
     NormPriority should be reduced to NormPriority by the Net-
     Nodes until such time that the Security Structure process is
     in place. There is a flag in the QoS Structure, bit 3 of CH,
     that indicates that a security structure follows the QoS
     Structure(s). The security Structure is intended to include
     encrypted information that conveys to the network and to the
     receiver a code assigned for a period of time by a AAA server
     which identifies the person and/or system which is sending the
     flow. The Net-Node equipment can then query the AAA server to
     find out this user's maximum priority authorization if they
     are registered. The network can then allow higher priority to
     Emergency Service workers in the public network, military
     officials in a military network, or corporate officials or
     processes in a corporate network. The bottom levels of
     priority would allow all users to prioritize background tasks,
     interactive tasks and critical tasks as they choose. The
     network would not however have the authority to find the users
     name or other details from the AAA servers since they are only
     authorized to obtain priority. The receiver may have other
     characteristics it is authorized to request like the users
     name if the receiver is a bank. The user would then have
     authorized the AAA server convey their name to that bank. All
     the details of the security structure are currently incomplete
     thus the security authorization process will need to be
     submitted later.

   . Denial of Service attacks could be launched to try an overload
     the Net-Node processes with Signaling packets. However, Net-
     Nodes should always limit the frequency of Signaling Packets
     to the agreed frequency of 1 per second per flow or 1 per 128
     packets, so as to avoid this attack. If a sender exceeds this
     rate, then that source address can be blacklisted or reduced
     to a very low raate. Also, standard subscriber equalization
     (which ensures all active subscribers receive nearly equal
     capacity) eliminates most other overload type of attacks.

Internet-Draft        Flow State Aware Signaling               Nov 2010


   . Requests for large fixed bandwidths could attempt to block
     others from obtaining capacity. However, the suggested method
     for the Net-Nodes is to not reserve any bandwidth, but to
     continuously measure the total usage and to keep say 8%
     headroom for rapid changes. This way for anyone to try and
     block others can only be done by using the capacity. Again,
     subscriber equalization can assure that no individual could
     block others.

   . There are many other areas where security could become an
     issue. When the security structure is added, these will be
     considered.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA should add the FSA Ethertype to its approved list of
   Ethertypes. This is desirable so that IP equipment knows what
   the FSA Ethertype means; however, they could always look at the
   IEEE list.

7. Conclusions

   Pursuant to RFC 4775 [RFC 4775], this Internet Draft sets forth the 
   FSA protocol that the ITU has been working on for many years. In 
   its liaison to the ITU, the IESG has suggested that new protocols
   might be a viable way to identify signaling packets. Rather than
   use up protocol codes, this proposal uses the already defined
   and well understood technique of encapsulating using the GRE
   protocol with a IEEE issued Ethertype.  The purpose is to inform
   the IETF on the proposed protocol so that they can advise the
   ITU if they see any interoperability issues that the FSA
   protocol might have with the IETF standards.

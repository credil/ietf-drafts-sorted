Internet-Draft              SHA-2 MAC for SSH                 April 2011


1.  Overview and Rationale

   SSH [RFC4251] is a very common protocol for secure remote login on
   the Internet.  Currently, SSH defines data integrity verification
   using SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms [RFC4253].  Due to recent security
   concerns with these two algorithms, implementors and users request
   support for data integrity verification using SHA-2.

2.  Data Integrity Algorithms

   This memo adopts the style and conventions of [RFC4253] in defining
   new data integrity algorithms.

   The following new data integrity algorithms are defined:

   hmac-sha2-256     RECOMMENDED   HMAC-SHA2-256
                                   (digest length = 32 bytes,
                                    key length    = 32 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-256-96  OPTIONAL      first 96 bits of HMAC-SHA2-256
                                   (digest length = 12 bytes,
                                    key length    = 32 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-512     OPTIONAL      HMAC-SHA2-512
                                   (digest length = 64 bytes,
                                    key length    = 64 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-512-96  OPTIONAL      first 96 bits of HMAC-SHA2-512
                                   (digest length = 12 bytes,
                                    key length    = 64 bytes)

                                 Figure 1

   The HMAC mechanism is defined in [RFC2104].

   The SHA-2 algorithms are defined in [FIPS-180-2].

   Test vectors for use of HMAC with SHA-2 are provided in [RFC4231].

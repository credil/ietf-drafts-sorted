Abstract 

   Several types of Carrier Grade NATs have been proposed to simplify 
   IPv4/IPv6 transition of the edge network by integrating tunnels and 
   NAT. A very common scenario is that many users set up softwires to a 
   softwire concentrator for public or private access services. In order 
   to establish softwires successfully, a new mechanism is required to 
   enable users in the edge network to discover the information of the 
   concentrator. This document describes how a host or Customer Premises 
   Equipment discovers the remote softwire concentrator or CGN in a hub 
   and spoke network using DHCP. Based on two new Softwire Concentrator 
   Discovery DHCP Options, proposed in the document, a user can obtain 
   the information of the softwire concentrator or CGN and then set up a 
   tunnel to it.

1. Introduction 

   Transition is an important factor for user experience in IPv4 and 
   IPv6 coexistence phase. The transition of the edge network is the 
   most complicated because it is near lots of users and uses multiple 
   network technologies. Recently, several types of Carrier-Grade-NATs 
   (CGNs) have been proposed to simplify IPv4/IPv6 transition of the 
   edge network by integrating tunnels and NAT. Incremental CGN 
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-incremental-cgn] and 6rd [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd] 
   and describes how dispersed IPv6 users bridge with the IPv6 Internet 
   by tunnel spanning ipv4 infrastructure. The dual-stack lite 
   technology [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] is intended for 
   maintaining connectivity to legacy IPv4 devices and networks using 
   IPv4-over-IPv6 softwires while a service provider deploys an IPv6-
   only network. A very common scenario is that many users set up 
   softwires or tunnels to a softwire concentrator for public or private 
   access services.  

   The aforementioned scenarios have been abstracted as hub and spoke 
   networks in the IETF Softwire working group, and several 
   encapsulation techniques have been defined [RFC4925] [RFC5512]. 
   [RFC5571] discloses a mechanism in mesh network by BGP extension for 
   users to discover the information of a tunnel end point. However, the 
   nodes in an edge network do not have BGP capability generally. Manual 
   configuration is not suitable because the address and other attribute 
   of the concentrator may change. A new mechanism is required to enable 
   users in edge network to discover the information of the concentrator 
   automatically. 

   In order to establish a softwire successfully, users must know the 
   information of a softwire concentrator or CGN, such as address, 
   tunnel type. Additionally, the discovery process may also support 
   multiple protocol type in tunnel, load-sharing and recovery from a 
   single point of failure. 

   Since ISPs may use different softwire technologies, an ISP-
   independent CPE should support as many as possible potential softwire 
   technologies and be able to auto discovery which softwire 
   technologies is in use. Even within a single ISP, different softwire 
   technologies may also use to differentiate customers, e.g., support 
   of secured encapsulation for some customers and plain IP-in-IP 
   encapsulation for others. 

   For scalability and stability purposes, customers may be assigned 
   different/multiple softwire concentrators through the discovery 
   mechanism.

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP [RFC2131], [RFC3315]) 
   is widely used in edge networks to enable auto-configuration. This 
   document extends DHCP to support discovery of a softwire concentrator 
   or CGN. This mechanism is general for 6rd, incremental CGN, DS-Lite 
   and Port-range Router [I-D.boucadair-port-rang]. It can also be 
   extended to support the discovery of other concentrators with 
   tunnels. 

   In the absence of DHCP, PPP or Router Advertisements could be used to 
   find a softwire concentrator or CGN automatically, but this document 
   does not discuss these methods in detail. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. DHCP Solution Overview for Softwire Concentrator Discovery 

   In order to support softwire concentrator or CGN discovery, two new 
   DHCP options are defined respectively for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. They 
   have the identical structure apart from address length.  

   When a DHCP server answers a client request message, softwire 
   concentrator information can be carried in a DHCP reply message. Thus 
   a client is configured the address and other attributes of a softwire 
   concentrator or CGN and can automatically set up a tunnel. 

   DHCP server decides to attach SCD option based on policy. One choice 
   is to respond only if the client requests the SCD option; another is 
   to append it to every reply no matter the client requests the SCD 
   option or not. 

   For load sharing or single-point failure recovery purposes, a DHCPv4 
   reply message may carry multiple instances in a single DHCPv4 SCD 
   option; a DHCPv6 reply message may carry more than one DHCPv6 SCP 
   options. 

   Section 4 defines a new DHCPv4 Softwire Concentrator Discovery (SCD) 
   option while Section 5 defines DHCPv6 SCD option. Section 4.1 defines 
   sub-options that apply to DHCPv4 SCD option while Section 5.1 defines 
   sub-options that apply to DHCPv6 SCD option.

4. DHCPv4 Softwire Concentrator Discovery (SCD) Option 

   The DHCPv4 Softwire Concentrator Discovery (SCD) Option is mainly 
   used when an IPv6 host or CPE in an IPv4 ISP network wants to obtain 
   an IPv4 address of an IPv6 access point or an incremental CGN. The 
   Option is carried in DHCPv4. 

   A DHCPv4 message can carry only one DHCPv4 SCD Option. Multiple 
   instances can be concatenated in the DHCPv4 SCD Option, as follow: 

                    |<----Instance1---->|<----Instance2---->| 
       Code    Len     Len        Data    Len       Data

      +------+------+------+------------+------+------------+-- 

   The DHCPv4 SCD Option is structured as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3

      Tunnel Type   Tunnel type which users connect to softwire  
                    concentrators or CGN. A few initial value 
                    assignments, like L2TPv2, GRE, ISATAP, 6to4, 6rd, 
                    IPSec and other IP in IP, is listed in Section 8 
                    IANA consideration.

      Preference    This indicates the preference level for a softwire  
                    concentrator or CGN. 0 is the highest. When  
                    receiving multiple instances, the user chooses a  
                    primary softwire concentrator among them based on  
                    the preference. The others are backup softwire  
                    concentrators. The service provider assigns  
                    different preference for each softwire concentrator  
                    to support traffic engineering. 

      Softwire Concentrator or CGN Address   The outer layer IPv4  
                    address of softwire concentrator, which is used to  
                    establish tunnel. 

      Sub Options   An optional, variable length field which is defined 
                    in Section 4.1. 

4.1. Suboptions in DHCPv4 SCD Option  

   The suboptions defined in this section can be applied to DHCPv4 SCD 
   option, defined above. They are used to configure the complementary 
   tunnel information. 

   The DHCPv4 SCD suboption is structured in TLV style as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3

      .               Suboption Value (Variable)                      . 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

       * DHCPv4 SCD Suboption Type (1 octet): each suboption type 
         defines a certain property about the tunnel. The following are 
         the types defined in this document: 

          - Protocol Type: suboption type = 0 

          - GRE Key: suboption type = 1 

         New suboptions may be defined in the future. Any unknown 
         suboptions MUST be ignored and skipped. 

       * Suboption Length (1 octet): the total number of octets of the 
         suboption value field.

       * Suboption Value (variable): encodings of the value field depend 
         on the suboption type as enumerated above.  

   The following sub-sections define the encoding in detail. 

4.1.1. Protocol Type Suboption 

   This suboption designates which protocol is encapsulated in tunnel. 

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- 

   The Protocol Type field is defined in [IANA-ET] as ETHER TYPEs. The 
   most used protocols are IPv4 (0x0800) and IPv6 (0x86dd). 

4.1.2. GRE Key Suboption 

   When the tunnel type is GRE, this suboption may be contained. 

       0                   1                   2                   3

      |         GRE Key (cont.)       |  
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

        GRE Key: 4-octet field [RFC2890] that is generated by the 
        Softwire Concentrator or CGN. If the client receives the GRE Key 
        suboption, the key MUST be inserted into the GRE encapsulation 
        header of the payload packets sent by the client to the Softwire 
        Concentrator or CGN. It is used for identifying extra context 
        information about the received payload. The payload packets 
        without the correspondent GRE key or with an unmatched GRE Key 
        will be silently dropped. 

5. DHCPv6 Softwire Concentrator Discovery (SCD) Option 

   The DHCPv6 Softwire Concentrator Discovery (SCD) Option is mainly 
   used when an IPv4 host or CPE in an IPv6 ISP network wants to learn 
   an IPv6 address of an IPv4 access point or a DS-lite CGN. The Option 
   is carried in DHCPv6. 

   A DHCPv6 Reply message can carry more than one SCD Options.

                    concentrator or CGN. 0 is the highest. When  
                    receiving multiple options, user chooses a primary  
                    softwire concentrator among them based on the  
                    preference. The others are backup softwire  
                    concentrators. The service provider assigns  
                    different preference of each softwire concentrator  
                    to support traffic engineering. 

      Sub Options   An optional, variable length field is defined in 
                    Section 5.1. 

5.1. Suboptions in DHCPv6 SCD Option 

   The suboptions defined in this section can be applied to DHCPv6 SCD 
   option, defined above. They are used to configure the complementary 
   tunnel information.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

       * DHCPv4 SCD Suboption Type (2 octet): each suboption type 
         defines a certain property about the tunnel. The following are 
         the types defined in this document: 

          - Protocol Type: suboption type = 0 

          - Prefix: suboption type = 1 

          - GRE Key: suboption type = 2 

         New suboptions may be defined in the future. Any unknown 
         suboptions MUST be ignored and skipped. 

       * Suboption Length (2 octet): the total number of octets of the 
         suboption value field. 

       * Suboption Value (variable): encodings of the value field depend 
         on the suboption type as enumerated above.  

   The following sub-sections define the encoding in detail. 

5.1.1. Protocol Type Suboption 

   This suboption designates which protocol is encapsulated in tunnel. 

       0                   1                   2                   3

      |      Protocol Type            | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   The Protocol Type field is defined in [IANA-ET] as ETHER TYPEs. The 
   most used protocols are IPv4 (0x0800) and IPv6 (0x86dd).

5.1.2. Prefix Suboption 

   This suboption designates IPv6 prefix which is used to construct 
   internal address of the tunnel. 

       0                   1                   2                   3

      .              IPv6 Prefix                      |    Padding    . 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

        Len: total length of the prefix and padding fields in octets. 

        Prefix Len: Length for this prefix in bits. 

        IPv6 Prefix: IPv6 prefix allocated to the client to construct 
        internal address of the tunnel. 

        Padding: additional 0~7 bits MUST be padded at the end of IPv6 
        Prefix field when the value in Prefix Len field is not a 
        multiple of 8-bit. The padding bits SHOULD be set as 0. 

   The semantics of the value field is determined by the tunnel type. 
   For example, a client can obtain IPv6 Prefix of ISATAP tunnel by this 
   suboption in DHCPv6 SDC Option. 

5.1.3. GRE Key Suboption 

   When the tunnel type is GRE, this suboption may be contained.  

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                            GRE Key                            | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

        GRE Key: 4-octet field [RFC2890] that is generated by the 
        Softwire Concentrator or CGN. If the client receives the GRE Key 
        suboption, the key MUST be inserted into the GRE encapsulation 
        header of the payload packets sent by the client to the Softwire 
        Concentrator or CGN. It is used for identifying extra context

        information about the received payload. The payload packets 
        without the correspondent GRE key or with an unmatched GRE Key 
        will be silently dropped. 

6. Illustration Examples 

6.1. Example 1: Incremental CGN scenario 

   As an example, an incremental CGN with IP address 192.0.2.1 and 
   L2TPv2 tunnel support is deployed in an IPv4 ISP network. The CGN 
   information is stored in a DHCPv4 server. When a dual stack user in 
   the network wants to connect IPv6 Internet, it will send a DHCPv4 
   request message to the DHCP server to obtain the CGN information. The 
   DHCP server replies with a SCD option. The parameters in the SCD 
   option are "CGN address = 192.0.2.1, tunnel type = 1, preference = 
   80". After the user receives the option, it can set up an L2TPv2 
   tunnel with the CGN. 

6.2. Example 2: two CGN in DS lite scenario 

   In another example scenario, there are two DS lite CGNs deployed in 
   order to provide redundancy and load balancing. DS lite CGN1 is 
   2001:db8:a::1, the other CGN2 is 2001:db8:b::1. Both of them support 
   IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel. The preference of each CGN is decided by the 
   network management policy. A user may get two SCD options, one 
   describes CGN1 "CGN address = 2001:db8:a::1, tunnel type = 3, 
   preference = 80" and the other describes CGN2 "CGN address = 
   2001:db8:b::1, tunnel type = 3, preference = 255". The user should 
   establish an IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel with the CGN1, which has higher 
   preference. When the CGN1 is down, the user may re-establish tunnel 
   to the CGN2. 

   For the load balancing purpose, another user may receive the options, 
   in which CGN2 has the higher preference value. The user may set CGN2 
   as its primary CGN. 

7. Security Considerations 

   There are two forms of attack using bogus SCD options should be 
   noticeable: 

       1. A wiretap attack, in which a bogus concentrator observes the 
       traffic before pretending to be the real client and sending the 
       traffic to the real concentrator. 

       2. A DoS attack, in which a bogus concentrator is used in some 
       way to create a loop or simply to act as a source of DoS packets.

Internet-Draft   draft-guo-softwire-sc-discovery-04          July 2010 
    

   The mechanisms based on DHCPv6 are all vulnerable by man-in-middle 
   attacks. Proper use of DHCPv6 auto-configuration facilities 
   [RFC3315], such as AUTH option or Secure DHCPv6 
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6] can prevent these threats, provided that 
   a configuration token is known to both the client and the server. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to allocate one DHCPv4 SCD Option code TBD1 and one 
   DHCPv6 Option code TBD2. 

   This document defines three new namespaces: 

      - Tunnel Types 
      - DHCPv4 SCD Suboption Types 
      - DHCPv6 SCD Suboption Types 

8.1. Tunnel Types 

   Section 4 & 5 defines the following Tunnel Types, which should 
   assigned by IANA for use within DHCPv4 & DHCPv6 SCD Option. IANA set 
   up a registry for "Tunnel Types for DHCP SCD Option". This is a 
   registry of one-octet values (0-255), to be assigned on a first-come, 
   first-served basis. The initial assignments are as follows: 

      Tunnel Name                             Type 
      ---------------                         ----- 
      Reserved                                  0 
      L2TPv2                                    1 
      GRE                                       2 
      IP-in-IP                                  3 
      ISATAP                                    4 
      6to4                                      5 
      6rd                                       6 
      IPsec                                     7 

8.2. DHCPv4 SCD Suboption Types 

   Section 4.1 defines the following SCD Suboption Types, which should 
   assigned by IANA for use within DHCPv4 SCD Option. IANA set up a 
   registry for "DHCPv4 SCD Suboption Types". This is a registry of one-
   octet values (0-255), to be assigned on a first-come, first-served 
   basis. The initial assignments are as follows:

8.3. DHCPv6 SCD Suboption Types 

   Section 5.1 defines the following SCD Suboption Types, which should 
   assigned by IANA for use within DHCPv6 SCD Option. IANA set up a 
   registry for "DHCPv6 SCD Suboption Types". This is a registry of one-
   octet values (0-255), to be assigned on a first-come, first-served 
   basis. The initial assignments are as follows: 

      Tunnel Name                             Type

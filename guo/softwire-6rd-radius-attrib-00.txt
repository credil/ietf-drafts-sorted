Abstract 

   6rd is One of the most popular methods to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 
   connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing 
   period. The DHCP 6rd option has been defined to configure 6rd CPE. 
   But in many networks, the configuration information may be stored in 
   AAA servers while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network 
   Gateway (BNG) through DHC protocol. This document defines a RADIUS 
   attribute that carries 6rd configuration information from AAA server 
   to BNG.

1. Introduction 

   Recently providers start to deploy IPv6 and consider how to transit 
   to IPv6. 6rd [RFC5969] is one of the most popular methods to provide 
   both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the 
   IPv4/IPv6 co-existing period. 6rd is used to provide IPv6 
   connectivity service through legacy IPv4-only infrastructure. 6rd 
   adopt DHCP as auto-configuring protocol. The 6rd CPE extends DHCP 
   option to discover 6rd border relay and to configure IPv6 prefix and 
   address. 

   In many networks, user configuration information may be managed by 
   AAA servers, together with user Authentication, Authorization, and 
   Accounting (AAA). Current AAA servers communicate using the RADIUS 
   (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service, [RFC2865]) protocol. 
   In a fixed line broadband network, the Broadband Network Gateways 
   (BNGs) act as the access gateway of users (hosts or CPEs). The BNGs 
   are assumed to embed a DHCP server function that allows them to 
   locally handle any DHCP requests issued by hosts. 

   Since the 6rd configuration information is stored in AAA servers and 
   user configuration is mainly through DHC protocol between BNGs and 
   hosts. New RADIUS attributes are needed to propagate the information 
   from AAA servers to BNGs. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. 6rd Configuration with RADIUS 

   The below Figure 1 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCP are 
   cooperated to provide users/hosts with 6rd configuration.

                Figure 1: the cooperation between DHCP and RADIUS 

   BNGs act as a bridge between user and AAA server. First, a BNG 
   receives a user DHCPDISCOVER. It initiates the BNG to request 
   correspondent user authentication relevant from an AAA server using 
   RADIUS protocol. A 6rd request may be also sent in the same message. 
   If the user authentication is approved by the AAA server, an Accept 
   message is acknowledged with the 6rd Attribute, defined in the next 
   Section. After the BNG responds to the user with an Advertise  
   message, the user requests for a 6rd Option. Then, the BNG can reply 
   the user using DHCP protocol. 

4. Attributes 

   This section defines 6rd attribute which is used in the 6rd scenario. 

4.1. 6rd Attribute

                     with one BR IPv4 address).

                     across all CE IPv4 addresses within a given 6rd 
                     domain. This may be any value between 0 and 32.

5. Diameter Considerations 

   This attribute is usable within either RADIUS or Diameter [RFC3588]. 
   Since the Attributes defined in this document will be allocated from 
   the standard RADIUS type space, no special handling is required by 
   Diameter entities. 

6. Security Considerations 

   In 6rd scenarios, the RADIUS protocol is run over IPv4. Known 
   security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol are discussed in RFC 
   2607 [RFC2607], RFC 2865 [RFC2865], and RFC 2869 [RFC2869]. Use of 
   IPsec [RFC4301] for providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 
   is discussed in RFC 3162 [RFC3162]. 

   Security considerations for the Diameter protocol are discussed in 
   RFC 3588 [RFC3588]. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires the assignment of two new RADIUS Attribute 
   Types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following 
   attributes: 

      o  6rd 

   IANA should allocate these numbers from the standard RADIUS 
   Attributes space using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010
        

1. Introduction 

   Since 1997, the Italian Laws have recognized electronic delivery 
   systems as legally usable. In 2005 after two years of technical 
   tests, the characteristics of an official electronic delivery 
   service, named certified electronic mail (in Italian Posta 
   Elettronica Certificata, from now on "PEC") were defined, giving 
   the system legal standing.
   This document represents the English version of the Italian 
   specfications, (http://www.cnipa.gov.it/site/_files/Pec-def.pdf) 
   which will be the ultimate PEC reference.
       
1.1. Scope 

   To ensure secure transactions over the Internet, cryptography can 
   be associated with electronic messages in order to provide some 
   guarantee on sender identity, message integrity, confidentiality, 
   and non-repudiation of origin. Many end-to-end techniques exist to 
   accomplish such goals, and some offer a high level of security. The 
   downside of end-to-end cryptography is the need for an extensive 
   penetration of technology in society, because it is essential for 
   every user to have asymmetric keys and certificates signed by a 
   Certification Authority. Along with that, users would need to have 
   an adequate amount of knowledge regarding the use of such 
   technology.

   PEC on the other hand uses applications running on servers to 
   digitally sign messages, thus avoiding the complexity end-to-end 
   systems bring about. By doing so, the user needs only have an 
   ordinary mail client with which to interact. The downside is that 
   the level of security drops, since the protection does not cover the
   entire transaction. Nonetheless, application is simpler and does not
   require specific user skills, making it easily more widespread among
   users.  

   This document describes PEC's technical aspects and features. It 
   presents the details of the protocol and the messages that are sent 
   between service providers, introducing the system adopted by the 
   Italian government for the exchange of certified emails. 


1.2. Notational Conventions 

1.2.1. Requirement Conventions 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [REQ].

   Msgid: Is the message ID generated by the email client, as defined 
   in [EMAIL], before the message is submitted to the PEC system. 

   Ordinary mail: Non-PEC email messages.

   Original message: Is the user-generated message before its arrival 
   to the sender access point. The original message is delivered to the
   recipient inside a PEC transport envelope. 
 
   PEC domain: Corresponds to a DNS domain dedicated to the holders' 
   mailboxes.  

   PEC mailbox: An electronic mailbox for which delivery PEC 
   notifications are issued upon reception of PEC messages. Such a 
   mailbox can be defined exclusively within a PEC domain. 

   PEC msgid: Is a unique identifier generated by the PEC system, which
   will substitute the msgid. 

   PEC provider: The entity that handles one or more PEC domains with 
   their relative points of access, reception, and delivery. It is the 
   holder of the key that is used for signing PEC notifications and 
   envelope, and it interacts with other PEC providers for 
   interoperability with other holders. 
   
   PEC provider's key: Is a key released by DigitPA to every PEC 
   provider. It is used to sign PEC notifications and envelopes, and to
   authorize access to the PEC providers directory. 

   PEC providers directory: Is an LDAP server positioned in an area 
   reachable by all PEC service providers. It constitutes the technical
   structure related to the public list of PEC service providers and 
   contains the list of PEC domains and service providers with relevant
   certificates.

   Service mailbox: A mailbox for the sole use of the provider, 
   dedicated for the reception of take in charge and virus detection 
   PEC notifications. 
     
   Time stamp: A digital evidence with which a temporal reference, that
   can't be repudiated, is attributed to one or more documents. 
   
2. PEC model 

2.1. System-generated messages 

   The PEC system generates messages in MIME format composed of a 
   descriptive textual part and other [MIME1] parts, the number and 
   content of which varies according to the type of message generated.


Gennai et al.            Expires February 08, 2011             [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


   A system-generated message falls into one of the following 
   categories: 

   o Notifications; 

   o Envelopes. 

   The message is inserted in an S/MIME v3 structure in CMS format 
   and signed with the PEC provider's private key. The X.509v3 
   certificate associated with the key MUST be included in the 
   aforementioned structure. The S/MIME format used to sign system-
   generated messages is the "multipart/signed" format (.p7s), as 
   described in section 3.4.3 of [SMIMEV3]. 

   To guarantee the verifiability of signatures on as many mail clients
   as possible, X.509v3 certificates used by certified email systems 
   MUST abide by the profile found in section 6.5. 

   In order for the receiving mail client to verify the signature, 
   the sender address MUST coincide with the one indicated within the 
   X.509v3 certificate. For this mechanism, PEC transport envelopes 
   MUST indicate in the "From:" field a single author's address which 
   is different from the one contained in the original message. To 
   allow for better message usability by the receiving user, the 
   author's mail address in the original message is inserted as a 
   "display name". For example, a "From:" field such as: 

         From: "John Smith" <john.smith@domain.example.com> 
   
   would result in the following "From:" value in the respective 
   PEC transport envelope: 

         From: "On behalf of: john.smith@domain.example.com" 
                                  <certified-mail@provider.example.com>
   
   Both "From:" and "Sender:" fields MUST contain the same value. In 
   order for replies to be correctly sent back to the proper 
   destination, the "Reply-To:" field in the PEC transport envelope 
   MUST contain the same unaltered value of the original message's 
   "Reply-To:" field. When it is not explicitly specified in the 
   original message, the system that generates the PEC transport 
   envelope creates it by extracting the information from the "From:" 
   field in the original message.  

   When PEC notifications are sent, the system MUST use the original 
   message sender's address as the destination address, as is specified
   in the reverse path data of the SMTP protocol. PEC notifications 
   MUST be sent to the sender's PEC mailbox without taking into account
   the "Reply-To:" field, which might be present in the original 
   message's header.

   All system-generated PEC messages are identifiable for having a 
   specific header defined in PEC according to the type of message 
   generated. 

   To determine the certification data, the elements used for the 
   actual routing of the message are employed. In SMTP dialog phases, 
   the reverse path and forward path data ("MAIL FROM" and "RCPT TO" 
   commands) are thus considered certification data of both the sender 
   and the recipients respectively. Addressing data present in the 
   message body ("To:" and "Cc:" fields) are used solely in order to 
   discriminate between primary and carbon copy recipients when 
   necessary; addressing data present in the "Bcc:" field MUST be 
   considered invalid by the system. 

2.1.1. Message types 

   All system-generated messages inherit their header fields and values
   from the original message, with extra fields added according to the 
   type of message generated. 

2.1.1.1. PEC notifications 

   They have the purpose of informing the sending user and interacting 
   providers of the progress the message is making within the PEC 
   network. 

2.1.1.1.1. Success PEC notifications 

   Indicates an acknowledgment on the provider's side for the reception
   or handling of a PEC message. More specifically, it can indicate one
   of 3 situations: acceptance, take in charge, or delivery. 

   Added header fields are: 

   o X-Ricevuta 

   o X-Riferimento-Message-ID 

   The field "X-Ricevuta" (Notification) indicates the type of 
   PEC notification contained in the message, whereas "X-Riferimento-
   Message-ID" (Reference Message-ID) contains the message ID generated
   by the mail client. 

   Body contents differ according to notification type. This is 
   described more thoroughly in chapter 3. 

   o An acceptance PEC notification informs the user that his provider 
     has accepted the message and will be taking care of passing it on 
     to the provider(s) of the addressee(s).

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


   o A take in charge PEC notification is an inter-provider 
     communication only, it MUST NOT be sent to the users. With this 
     notification, the receiving provider simply informs the sending 
     one that it has received a PEC message, and will take the 
     responsibility of forwarding it to the addressee(s). From then on,
     the sender provider is no longer held responsible as to the 
     whereabouts of the message, but is limited to notifying its user 
     of the success or failure of delivery. 
   o Delivery PEC notifications take place as the final communication 
     of a transaction, indicating overall success in handing the 
     message over to the addressee(s). 

2.1.1.1.2. Delay PEC notifications 

   Delay PEC notifications are sent out 12 hours after a message has 
   been dispatched from the sending provider, and no take in charge or 
   delivery PEC notification was received. These have the sole purpose 
   of notifying the user of the delay. 

   If another 12 hours go by without any sign of a take in charge or 
   delivery PEC notification (amounting to a 24-hour delay), another 
   delay PEC notification is dispatched to the user informing him of 
   the possible delivery failure. The provider will not keep track of 
   the delay any further. 

2.1.1.1.3. Failure PEC notifications 

   They are sent when there is some error in transmission or reception.
   More specifically, a failure PEC notification can indicate either a 
   formal-exception error, or a virus detection. 

   Added header fields are: 

   o X-Ricevuta; 
   
   o X-Riferimento-Message-ID; 

   o X-VerificaSicurezza [optional] 

   "X-Ricevuta" (Notification) and "X-Riferimento-Message-ID" 
   (Reference Message-ID) have the same roles as indicated in section 
   2.1.1.1.1 (Success Notifications). "X-VerificaSicurezza" (Security 
   Verification) is an optional header field, used for virus-related 
   PEC notifications. 

   Body contents differ according to notification type. This is 
   described more thoroughly in chapter 3.

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


2.1.1.2. PEC envelopes 

   Messages entering the PEC network are inserted within specific PEC 
   messages, called envelopes, before they are allowed to circulate 
   further within the network. These envelopes MUST inherit the 
   following header fields, along with their unmodified values, from 
   the message itself:
     
   o Received 

   o To 

   o Cc 

   o Return-Path 

   o Reply-to (if present) 

   Depending on the type of message requesting admission into the PEC 
   network, it will be inserted either in a "Transport Envelope", or in
   a "Anomaly Envelope". Distinction will be possible through the 
   addition of the "X-Transport" header field.

   where: 

   AP = Access Point 
   DP = Delivery Point 
   InP = Incoming Point 

2.2.1. Access point 

   This is what the user client at the sender side interacts with, 
   giving the user access to PEC services set up by the provider. 

  
Gennai et al.            Expires February 08, 2011            [Page 10]

   Such access MUST be preceded by user authentication on the system 
   (see section 5.2). The access point receives the original messages 
   its user wishes to send, runs some formal checks, and acts according
   to the outcome: 

   o if the message passes all checks, the access point generates an 
     acceptance PEC notification and inserts the original message 
     inside a PEC transport envelope; 

   o if a formal exception is detected, the access point refuses the 
     message and emits the relevant non-acceptance PEC notification 
     (see section 3.1.1); 

   o if a virus is detected, the access point generates a non-
     acceptance PEC notification and inserts the original message as is
     in the provider's special store. 

   Generation of the acceptance notification indicates to the user that
   the message was accepted by the system, certifying also the date and
   time of the event. The notification MUST contain user-readable text,
   and an XML part containing the certification data. 
   The notification MAY also contain other attachments for extra 
   features offered by the provider. 
        
   Using the data available in the PEC providers directory (see section
   4.5), the access point runs checks on every recipient in the "To:" 
   and "Cc:" fields present in the original message to verify whether 
   they belong to the PEC infrastructure or to non-PEC domains. Such 
   checks are done by verifying the existence, through a case 
   insensitive search, of the recipients' domains in the 
   "managedDomains" attribute found within the PEC providers directory.
   Therefore, the acceptance PEC notification (and relevant 
   certification data) relates, for each address, the typology of its 
   domain; PEC or non-PEC. 

   The identifier (from now on PEC msgid) of accepted original messages
   within the PEC infrastructure MUST be unambiguous in order to 
   consent correct tracking of messages and relative PEC notifications.
   The format of such an identifier is: 

        [alphanumeric string]@[provider mail domain] 

   or: 

        [alphanumeric string]@[FQDN mail server] 

   Therefore, both the original message and the corresponding PEC 
   transport envelope MUST contain the following header field: 

        Message-ID: <[unique identifier]> 

Gennai et al.            Expires February 08, 2011            [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


   When an email client that is interacting with the access point has 
   already inserted a Message ID (from now on msgid) in the original 
   message, that msgid SHALL be substituted by a PEC msgid. In order to
   allow the sender to link the message sent with the relative 
   PEC notifications, the msgid MUST be inserted in the original 
   message as well as the relative PEC notifications and transport 
   envelope. If present, the msgid is REQUIRED in the original 
   message's header by adding the following header field: 

        X-Riferimento-Message-ID: <[original Message ID]> 

   which will also be inserted in the PEC transport envelope and 
   notifications, and related in the certification data (see section 
   4.4). 

2.2.2. Incoming point 

   This point permits the exchange of PEC messages and notifications 
   between PEC providers. It is also the point through which ordinary 
   mail messages can be inserted within the system of certified mail. 

   The exchange of messages between providers takes place through 
   SMTP-based transactions, as defined in [SMTP]. If SMTP communication
   errors occur, they MAY be handled using the standard error 
   notification mechanisms, as provided by SMTP in [SMTP] and 
   [SMTP-DSN]. The same mechanism is also adopted for handling 
   transitory errors, that result in long idling periods, during an 
   SMTP transmission phase. In order to guarantee that an error is 
   returned to the user as defined in section 3.3.3, the systems that 
   handles PEC traffic MUST adopt a time limit for message idleness 
   equal to 24 hours. 

   Once a message arrives, the incoming point runs the following list 
   of checks and operations: 

   o verifies correctness and type of the incoming message; 

   o if the incoming message is a correct and undamaged PEC transport 
     envelope: 

     - emits a take in charge PEC notification towards the sender 
       provider (section 3.2.1); 

     - forwards the PEC transport envelope to the delivery point 
       (section 3.3). 
     
   o if the incoming message is a correct and undamaged PEC 
     notification, forwards the notification to the delivery point. 



Gennai et al.            Expires February 08, 2011            [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010

  
   o if the incoming message does not conform to the prerequisites of a
     correct and undamaged PEC transport envelope or notification, but 
     comes from a PEC provider, i.e. passes the verifications regarding
     existence, origin, and validity of the signature, then the message
     MUST be propagated towards the recipient. 
     Therefore, the incoming point: 

     - inserts the incoming message in an anomaly envelope (section 
       3.2.2); 

     - forwards the anomaly envelope to the delivery point. 
  
   o if the incoming message does not originate from a PEC system, i.e.
     fails verifications regarding existence, origin, and validity of 
     the signature, then the message will be treated as ordinary email,
     and, if propagated to the recipient: 

     - is inserted in an anomaly envelope (section 3.2.2); 

     - the anomaly envelope is forwarded to the delivery point. 
     
   The take in charge PEC notification is generated by the receiving 
   provider and sent to the sending provider. Its purpose is to keep 
   track of the message in its transition from one provider to another,
   and is therefore strictly intra-provider communication; the end user
   knows nothing about it. 

   To check the correctness and integrity of a PEC transport envelope 
   or notification, the incoming point runs the following tests: 

   o Signature existence - the system verifies the presence of an 
     S/MIME signature structure within the incoming message; 

   o Signature origin - the system verifies whether or not the 
     signature belongs to a PEC provider by extracting the certificate 
     used for signing and verifying its presence in the PEC providers 
     directory. To ease the check, it is possible to calculate the 
     certificate's [SHA1] hash value and perform a case-insensitive 
     search of its hexadecimal representation within the 
     "providerCertificateHash" attribute found in the PEC providers 
     directory. This operation allows to easily identify the sender 
     provider for subsequent and necessary matching checks between the 
     extracted certificate and the one present in the provider's 
     record;

   o Signature validity - S/MIME signature correctness is verified by 
     recalculating the signature value, checking the entire 
     certification path, and verifying the [CRL] and temporal validity 
     of the certificate. In case some caching mechanism is used for CRL

     contents, an update interval MUST be adopted so that the most up-
     to-date data is guaranteed, thus minimizing the possible delay 
     between a publication revocation by the Certification Authority 
     and the variation acknowledgment by the provider; 

   o Formal correctness - the provider performs sufficient and 
     necessary checks to guarantee that the incoming message is 
     compliant with the formats specified in this document (PEC 
     transport envelope and notifications). 

   If a virus-infected PEC transport envelope passes the checks just 
   mentioned it is still considered correct and undamaged. The presence
   of the virus will be detected in a second phase, during which the 
   contents of the PEC transport envelope are verified. Thus, the 
   incoming point will refrain from forwarding the message to the 
   recipient, instead sending the appropriate PEC notification of non-
   delivery and storing the virus-infected message in the provider's 
   special storage. 

   In case ordinary mail messages are received, the PEC provider SHALL 
   perform virus checks in order to prevent the infiltration of 
   potentially dangerous mail messages within the PEC system. If a 
   virus is detected in an ordinary mail message, the latter can be 
   discarded at the incoming point before it enters the PEC system. 
   In other words, no special treatment is reserved for the error, but 
   a handling that is conformant to the procedures usually followed for
   messages going through the Internet. 

   When the receiving provider detects a virus inside a PEC transport 
   envelope during the reception phase, it emits a virus detection PEC
   notification to the sending provider, which then realizes its checks
   failed to detect that virus. When this happens, the sending provider
   MUST:
   
   o check what virus typologies were not detected by its own antivirus
     to verify the possibility of interventions
   
   o send a virus-induced non-delivery PEC notification to the sender's
     mailbox.

2.2.3. Delivery point 

   Is the point that receives messages from the incoming point and 
   forwards them to the final recipient. 

   It MUST run a series of tests on received messages before forwarding
   them to the user (see section 3.3.1). It first verifies the typology
   of the message, and decides whether or not a PEC notification should
   be issued to the sender. The delivery PEC notification (section 


Gennai et al.            Expires February 08, 2011            [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


   3.3.2) is emitted after the message was delivered to the recipient's
   PEC mailbox and only at reception of a valid PEC transport envelope 
   (sections 2.2.2 and 3.1.5).
   
   In all other cases, such as anomaly envelopes and PEC notifications,
   the delivery PEC notification is not emitted. Regardless, the 
   message received from the delivery point MUST be delivered 
   unmodified to the recipient's mailbox. 
     
   The delivery PEC notification indicates to the sender that the 
   message sent was in fact conveyed to the specified recipient's 
   mailbox, and certifies the date and time of delivery through use of 
   user-readable text and an XML part containing certification data, 
   along with other possible attachments added for extra features 
   offered by the provider.

   If a PEC transport envelope received at the delivery point can't be 
   delivered to the destination mailbox, the delivery point emits a 
   non-delivery PEC notification (section 3.3.3). If, on the other 
   hand, the delivery error concerns a message that arrives from 
   Internet (i.e. a non-PEC message), no such notification is emitted.
      
2.2.4. Storage 

   Each provider MUST dedicate a special storage for the deposition 
   of any virus-infected messages encountered. Whether the virus be 
   detected by the sender's access point or the receiver's incoming 
   point, the provider that detects it MUST store the mail message in 
   its own storage, and keep it for 30 months. 

2.2.5. Provider service mailbox 

   For exclusive use of the provider, dedicated to the reception of PEC
   notifications in 2 cases only: 

   o take in charge notifications; and 

   o virus detection notification. 

2.2.6. Provider service email address

   Each provider MUST register a special purpose email address for use 
   when sending PEC transport envelopes and notifications, as 
   delineated in section 3. This address MAY conincide with that of the
   service mailbox described in section 2.2.5.
 
2.3. Log 

   The server administrator MUST keep track of any and all operations 


Gennai et al.            Expires February 08, 2011            [Page 15]

   carried out in a specific message log file. The information kept in 
   the log for each operation is the following: 

   o message ID (the value present in the Message-ID header field in 
     the original message) 

   o date and time of event 

   o sender of original message 

   o recipient(s) of original message 

   o subject of original message 

   o event type (reception, delivery, PEC notification emission, etc) 

   o Message-IDs of related generated messages 

   o sending provider 

   The service provider MUST store this data and preserve it 
   unmodified. Italian laws have specified that the service provider 
   retain the data for 30 months. 

3. Message processing 

3.1. Access point 

   The access point acts as a submission service as defined in 
   [SUBMISSION].

3.1.1. Formal checks on messages 

   When the access point receives a message the user wishes to send, it
   MUST guarantee said message's formal conformity as defined in 
   [EMAIL], and verify that the:

   o [EMAIL] header section contains a "From:" header field holding a 
     [EMAIL] compliant email address; 

   o [EMAIL] header section contains a "To:" header field holding one 
     or more [EMAIL] compliant email addresses; 

   o sender's address, specified in the SMTP reverse path, coincides 
     with the one in the message's "From:" header field; 

   o recipients' addresses specified in the SMTP forward path coincide 
     with the ones present in the "To:" or "Cc:" header fields of the 
     message;

   o "Bcc:" header field does not contain any value; 

   o total message size falls within the limits accepted by the 
     provider. Such limits apply depending on the number of recipients 
     as well; by multiplying it to the message size, the outcome MUST 
     fall within the limits accepted by the provider. Italian Laws have
     specified this limit as being 30MB. 
     
   If the message does not pass the tests, the access point MUST NOT 
   accept the message within the PEC system, thus emitting the relative
   PEC notification of non-acceptance. 

3.1.2. Non-acceptance PEC notification due to formal exceptions

   When the access point cannot forward the message received due to 
   failure in passing formal checks, the sender is notified of such an
   outcome. If the error is caused by the message failing size checks, 
   a non-acceptance PEC notification is sent as long as the size 
   remains bound by a certain limit. If the size exceeds said limit, 
   error handling is left to SMTP.  

   The notification header will contain the following fields:

        X-Ricevuta: non-accettazione 
        Date: [date of notification emission] 
        Subject: AVVISO DI NON ACCETTAZIONE: [original subject] 
        From: certified-mail@[mail domain] 
        To: [original sender] 
        X-Riferimento-Message-ID: [Message-ID of original message] 

   The notification body will contain a text part that constitutes the 
   actual notification in readable format according to a model that 
   relates the following information: 

        Error in message acceptance 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), in the message "[subject]" 
        originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to: 
        [recipient_1]

        [error description]. 
        The message was not accepted. 
        Message identification: [Message-ID] 

   The same certification information is inserted in an XML file to be
   added to the notification body, thus allowing automatic checks on

   the message (section 4.4). Parsing MUST be done on the XML part 
   only. Additional parts MAY be included by the provider for provider-
   specific services. Regardless, the original message MUST NOT be 
   included. The message MUST follow the format described in section 
   4.3.
   
3.1.3. Non-acceptance PEC notification due to virus detection 

   The access point MUST run some tests on the content of messages it
   receives from its users and reject them if a virus is detected. In 
   which case, a virus-detection-induced non-acceptance PEC 
   notification MUST be emitted to clearly inform the user of the 
   reason the message was refused.

   The notification header contains the following fields: 

        X-Ricevuta: non-accettazione 
        X-VerificaSicurezza: errore 
        Date: [notification emission date] 
        Subject: AVVISO DI NON ACCETTAZIONE PER VIRUS: [original 
                 subject]
        From: certified-mail@[mail_domain] 
        To: [original sender] 
        X-Riferimento-Message-ID: [Message-ID of original message] 

   The body contains a readable text part according to the following 
   model: 

        Error in message acceptance due to virus presence 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), in the message "[subject]" 
        originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to: 
        [recipient_1] 
        [recipient_2] 
        . 
        . 
        . 
        [recipient_n] 
        a security problem was detected [ID of detected content type]. 
        The message was not accepted. 
        Message identification: [Message-ID] 
        
   The same certification data is inserted in an XML file added to the 
   notification to allow for automatic checks (section 4.4). Parsing 
   MUST be done on the XML part only. Additional parts MAY be 
   included by the provider for provider-specific services. Regardless,
   the original message MUST NOT be included. The message MUST follow 
   the format described in section 4.3.

3.1.4. Acceptance PEC notification

   The acceptance PEC notification is a message sent to the sender, 
   containing date and time of acceptance, sender and recipient data, 
   and subject. 

   The header contains the following fields: 

        X-Ricevuta: accettazione 
        Date: [actual date of acceptance] 
        Subject: ACCETTAZIONE: [original subject] 
        From: certified-mail@[mail_domain] 
        To: [original sender] 
        X-Riferimento-Message-ID: [Message-ID of original message] 

   The message body contains a text part that constitutes the 
   notification in readable format, according to a model that relates 
   the following information: 

        Acceptance PEC notification 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), the message "[subject]" 
         originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to: 
        [recipient_1] (["certified mail" | "ordinary mail"]) 
        [recipient_2] (["certified mail" | "ordinary mail"]) 
        . 
        . 
        . 
        [recipient_n] (["certified mail" | "ordinary mail"]) 
        was accepted by the system and forwarded to the recipient(s). 
        Message identification: [Message-ID] 

   The same certification data is inserted in an XML file added to the
   notification message, allowing automatic checks on it (section 4.4).
   Parsing MUST be done on the XML part only. Additonal parts MAY be 
   included by the provider for provider-specific services. The message
   MUST follow the format described in section 4.3.

3.1.5. PEC Transport envelope 

   A PEC transport envelope is a message generated by the access point 
   which contains the original message as well as certification data.

   As mentioned in section 2.1.1.2, the PEC transport envelope inherits
   from the original message the values of the following header fields,
   which MUST be related unmodified: 

   o Received 

   o To 

   o Cc

   o Return-Path 

   o Reply-To (if present) 

   On the other hand, the following fields MUST be modified, or 
   inserted if necessary: 

        X-Trasporto: posta-certificata 
        Date: [actual date of acceptance] 
        Subject: POSTA CERTIFICATA: [original subject] 
        From: "On behalf of: [original sender]" 
                             <certified-mail@[mail_domain]> 
        Reply-To: [original sender] (inserted only if not present) 
        Message-ID: [PEC message ID generated as explained in 2.2.1] 
        X-Riferimento-Message-ID: [message ID of original message] 
        X-TipoRicevuta: [completa/breve/sintetica] 
       
   The "X-TipoRicevuta" field indicates the type of delivery PEC 
   notification the sender wishes to receive - complete, brief, or 
   concise. 

   The body of the PEC transport envelope contains a text part that 
   constitutes the readable format of the message according to a model 
   that relates the following certification data: 

        Certified mail message 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), the message "[subject]" was 
        sent by "[original sender]" and addressed to: 
        [recipient_1] 
        [recipient_2] 
        . 
        . 
        . 
        [recipient_n] 
        The original message is included in attachment. 
        Message identification: [Message-ID] 

   Within the PEC transport envelope, the entire, non-modified original
   message is inserted in a [EMAIL]-compliant format (except for what 
   has been said regarding the Message ID), as well as an XML part 
   which contains the certification data that was already related in

   notification requested (section 4.4). Parsing MUST be done on the 
   XML part only. Additional parts MAY be included by the provider for 
   provider-specific services. The message MUST follow the format 
   described in section 4.3.

   Note that the routing data of the PEC transport envelope (forward 
   and reverse paths) remain unaltered.

3.1.6. Timeout delivery error PEC notification 

   If the sending provider doesn't receive a take in charge or 
   delivery PEC notification from the receiving provider within 12 
   hours after message dispatch, it informs the user that the 
   recipient's provider might not be able to deliver the message. In 
   case the sending provider doesn't receive a delivery PEC 
   notification within 24 hours after message dispatch, it emits 
   another non-delivery PEC notification to the user by the 24-hour 
   timeout, but not before 22 hours have passed. 

   Such a communication takes place through a PEC notification of non-
   delivery due to timeout, the header of which contains the following 
   fields: 

        X-Ricevuta: preavviso-errore-consegna 
        Date: [date of notification emission] 
        Subject: AVVISO DI MANCATA CONSEGNA PER SUP. TEMPO MASSIMO: 
                 [original subject] 
        From: certified-mail@[mail_domain] 
        To: [original recipient] 
        X-Riferimento-Message-ID: [Message-ID of original message] 

   The body of the first non-delivery PEC notification (12-hour 
   timeout) contains a text part that represents the readable format 
   of the notification which will relate the following data: 

        Non-delivery PEC notification 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), the message 
        "[subject]" originating from "[original sender]" 
        and addressed to "[recipient]" 
        has not been delivered within the first 12 hours following 
        its dispatch. Not excluding that the message might eventually 
        be delivered, it is deemed useful to consider that dispatch 
        might not have a positive outcome. The system will see to 
        sending another non-delivery PEC notification if in the 
        following twelve hours no confirmation is received from the 
        recipient.  
        Message identification: [Message-ID] 

   On the other hand, 24-hour-timeout induced PEC notifications, which 
   have the same header as described above, will have the following 
   text in their body: 

        Non-delivery PEC notification 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), the message 
        "[subject]" originating from "[original sender]" 
        and addressed to "[recipient]" 
        has not been delivered within 24 hours of its dispatch.

        The transaction is deemed to be considered terminated with a 
        negative outcome. 
        Massage identification: [Message-ID] 

   The same certification data is inserted in an XML file added to both
   PEC notification types to allow automatic checks (section 4.4).
   
   Parsing MUST be done on the XML part only. Additional parts MAY be 
   added for services supplied by the PEC provider. Regardless, the 
   original message MUST NOT be included. The message MUST follow the 
   format described in section 4.3.

   A timeout PEC notification is generated if one of the following 
   scenarios occurs: 
        
   o the sending provider receives a take in charge PEC notification 
     during the first 12 hours following message dispatch, but does not
     receive a delivery PEC notification at all. In this case it would 
     be a 24-hour timeout PEC notification. 

   o the sending provider does not receive a take in charge PEC
     notification, but receives a delivery PEC notification after 12 
     hours and before the 24-hour timeout. In this case it would be a 
     12-hour timeout PEC notification. 

   o the sending provider doesn't receive either a take in charge nor a
     delivery PEC notification. In this case 2 timeout PEC 
     notifications are generated; a 12-hour and a 24-hour timeout PEC
     notification. 

3.2. Incoming point 

3.2.1. Take in charge PEC notification 

   When correct PEC transport envelopes (as defined in section 2.2.2.) 
   are exchanged between PEC providers, the receiver MUST send a take 
   in charge PEC notification to the sender. The single dispatched 
   notification concerns all recipients who belong to the same 
   provider, and to whom the incoming message was addressed, as stated 
   in the routing data (forward and reverse paths) of the SMTP 
   transaction. Within the certification data of a single take in 
   charge PEC notification, all recipients of the message to which it 
   refers are listed. In general, when receiving a PEC transport 
   envelope, each provider MUST emit one or more take in charge PEC 
   notifications to cover, in absence of SMTP transport errors, all the
   recipients in its jurisdiction. 

   The header of a take in charge PEC notification contains the 
   following fields:

        X-Ricevuta: presa-in-carico 
        Date: [date of take in charge] 
        Subject: PRESA IN CARICO: [original subject] 
        From: certified-mail@[mail_domain] 
        To: [sender provider service mailbox] 
        X-Riferimento-Message-ID: [Message-ID of original message] 

   The provider's service email address is obtained from the PEC 
   providers directory during the necessary queries made in the 
   signature verification stage. 

   The body contains a text part that follows the underlying model:

        take in charge PEC notification 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), the message "[subject]" 
        originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to: 
        [recipient_1] (["certified mail" | "ordinary mail"]) 
        [recipient_2] (["certified mail" | "ordinary mail"]) 
        . 
        . 
        . 
        [recipient_n] (["certified mail" | "ordinary mail"]) 
        was accepted by the system. 
        Message identification: [Message-ID] 

   The same certification data is inserted in an XML file which is 
   added to the notification message to allow for automatic checks 
   (section 4.4). Parsing MUST be done on the XML part only. Additional
   parts MAY be added by the provider for provider-specific services. 
   The message MUST follow the format described in section 4.3.

3.2.2. Anomaly envelope 

   If the tests on an incoming message detect an error, or the message 
   is identified as being ordinary mail and the provider is set to 
   forward it to the recipient, the system MUST insert such a message 
   in an anomaly envelope. Before delivery, the entire message received
   at the incoming point is inserted in an [EMAIL]-compliant format as 
   a [MIME1] part inside a new message that MUST inherit the unmodified 
   values for the following header fields from the received message:  

   o Received 

   o To 

   o Cc   
     
   o Return-Path 

   o Message-ID

   Whereas, the following header fields MUST be modified or inserted: 

        X-Trasporto: errore 
        Date: [message arrival date] 
        Subject: ANOMALIA MESSAGGIO: [original subject] 
        From: "On behalf of: [original sender]" 
                             <certified-mail@[mail_domain]> 
        Reply-To: [original sender (inserted only if not already 
                  present)] 

   The body contains a user-readable text part according to a model 
   that relates the following data: 
        
        Message anomaly 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), the message "[subject]" 
        originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to: 
        [recipient_1]  
        [recipient_2]  
        . 
        . 
        . 
        [recipient_n]  
        was received. 
        The data has not been certified due to the following error: 
        [concise description of error] 
        The original message is attached. 

   Due to uncertainty regarding origin and/or conformity of the message
   received, the anomaly envelope MUST NOT contain [MIME1] parts other
   than the entire message that arrived at the incoming point. 

   Note that the routing data of such an envelope (forward and reverse 
   paths) remain unaltered. Doing so guarantees both message forwarding 
   to the recipients, and reception of SMTP error notifications, if any
   occur, by the sender (as specified in [SMTP] & [SMTP-DSN]). 

3.2.3. Virus detection PEC notification 

   If the incoming point receives virus-infected PEC messages, it MUST 
   NOT forward them. Rather it MUST inform the sending provider, which 
   will in turn inform the sending user, of the failed transmission. 
   A separate PEC notification of virus detection MUST be sent on 
   behalf of every recipient within the provider's domain. 

   In case a virus is detected during the reception phase of a message 
   whose origin was asserted through sender signature verification, 
   the system generates a virus-detected PEC notification indicating 
   the error found, and sends it to the sending provider's service 
   mailbox.

   The header of this PEC notification contains the following fields:

   relates the following data: 

        Virus detection PEC notification 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), in the message "[subject]" 
        originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to 
        "[recipient]" 
        a security problem was detected [ID of content type detected]. 
        Message identification: [Message-ID] 

   The same certification data is inserted in an XML file and added to 
   the notification to allow for automatic checks (section 4.4). 
   Parsing MUST be done on the XML part only. Additional parts MAY be
   included by the provider for provider-specific services. Regardless,
   the original message MUST NOT be included. The message MUST follow 
   the format described in section 4.3.

   The message body MUST contain the reason for which the transmission 
   could not be completed. 

3.2.4. Virus-induced delivery error PEC notification 

   At the reception of a virus detected PEC notification from the 
   receiving provider, the sender provider emits a non-delivery PEC 
   notification to the sending user. 

   The header for this notification contains the following fields: 

        X-Ricevuta: errore-consegna 
        X-VerificaSicurezza: errore 
        Date: [date of notification emission]

        addressed to "[recipient]" 
        a security problem was detected [ID of content type detected 
        by the anti-virus]. 
        The message was not delivered. 
        Message identification: [Message-ID] 

   All the information necessary for the construction of such a PEC
   notification can be obtained from the correlated virus-detected 
   PEC notification. 

   The same certification data is inserted in an XML file and added to 
   the notification message to allow for automatic checks (section 
   4.4). Parsing MUST be done on the XML part only. Additional parts 
   MAY be included by the provider for provider-specific services. The 
   reason the transaction was not completed MUST be specified in the 
   message, which MUST follow the format described in section 4.3.

3.3. Delivery point 

3.3.1. Checks on incoming messages 

   When a message arrives at the delivery point, the system verifies: 

   O message type   
     
   O whether or not a PEC notification has to be returned.

3.3.2. Delivery PEC notification 

   A delivery PEC notification is issued only after a correct PEC 
   transport envelope (sections 2.2.2. and 3.1.5) has been delivered to
   the recipient's mailbox. 
   
   In all other cases (e.g. anomaly envelopes, PEC notifications), the 
   delivery PEC notification is not issued. Regardless, the message 
   received at the delivery point MUST be delivered to the recipient's 
   mailbox unchanged. 
  
   This notification tells the user that his/her message has been   
   successfully delivered to the specified recipient. It includes 
   readable text that certifies the date and time of delivery, sender 
   and receiver data, and the subject. It also contains an XML   
   certification data file and other optional parts for functionalities      
   offered by the provider. 

   The following fields are inserted in the header:

        X-Ricevuta: avvenuta-consegna 
        Date: [delivery date] 
        Subject: CONSEGNA: [original subject] 
        From: certified-mail@[mail_domain] 
        To: [original sender] 
        X-Riferimento-Message-ID: [Message-ID of original message] 

   The value of the "X-TipoRicevuta" header field in the PEC transport 
   envelope is derived from the original message, thus allowing the 
   sender to determine the type of delivery PEC notification requested 
   from the primary recipients of the original message. 
   The notification MUST follow the format described in section 4.3.

3.3.2.1. Delivery PEC notification: complete 

   This is the default value for delivery PEC notifications. When no 
   value for the "X-TipoRicevuta" is specified, or when it contains the
   value "complete", the system will require a complete delivery PEC 
   notification from addressees in the "To:" field, while a concise PEC
   notification (section 3.3.2.3) will be required from those in the 
   "Cc:" field. The distinction between primary recipients and those 
   in carbon copy is done through an analysis of the "To:" and "Cc:" 
   fields. For PEC notifications sent on behalf of primary recipients, 
   a complete copy of the original message along with any attachments 
   is inserted in the notification. In case the system in charge of 
   delivery is not able to determine the recipient type due to 
   ambiguity problems in the "To:" and "Cc:" fields, delivery MUST be 
   considered as if addressed to a primary recipient and include the 
   complete copy of the original message. 
  
   The notification body contains a readable text part that relates
   certifcation data according to the following model:
   
        Delivery PEC notification 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), the message "[subject]" 
        originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to 
        "[recipient]" 
        was placed in the destination's mailbox. 
        Message identification: [Message-ID] 
     
   The same certification data is inserted in an XML file and added to
   the notification (section 4.4), along with any other parts that MAY
   inserted by the provider for provider-specific services. Parsing
   MUST be done on the XML part only. The delivery PEC notification 
   MUST be issued on behalf of every recipient of the message, and MUST
   follow the format described in section 4.3.

3.3.2.2. Delivery PEC notification: brief 

   In order to decrease the amount of data flowing, it is possible 
   for the sender to ask for a delivery PEC notification in "brief" 
   format. The brief delivery PEC notification contains the original 
   message and a ciphered hash value for each of its parts. The hash 
   value SHOULD be calculated on base64 encoded parts. As specified in 
   section 5.3, PEC messages MUST transit only on machines that belong 
   to the PEC network, and which MUST NOT alter the encoding of the 
   message during its transition/processing. 
   
   NOTE: Even though PEC uses these relaxed specifications, PEC 
   interoperability tests between over 20 service providers have never 
   revealed any problems. This is probably due to mail servers leaning 
   more towards leaving the messages they receive intact without 
   applying any changes. But issues might arise if a server decides to 
   modify encoded parts; for example, change the base64 line length, 
   whose hash value calculated at the receiver's end would then differ 
   from that at the sender's side.
   
   To be able to verify the transmitted contents it is necessary for 
   the sender to keep the unaltered original copy of the part(s) to 
   which the hash values refer. 

   If the PEC transport envelope contains the header 

        X-TipoRicevuta: breve 

   the delivery point emits a brief delivery PEC notification on behalf
   of the primary recipients, and a concise one (section 3.3.2.3) on 
   behalf of carbon copy recipients. The value of the header field in 
   the PEC transport envelope is derived from the original message. 

   The notification body contains a readable text part according to a 
   model that relates the following certification data: 

        Brief delivery PEC notification 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), the message "[subject]" 
        originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to 
        "[recipient]" 
        was placed in the destination's mailbox. 
        Message identification:  [Message-ID] 

   The same certification data is inserted in an XML file and added to 
   the notification (section 4.4), along with other parts which MAY be 
   included for specific provider-supplied services. Parsing MUST be 
   done on the XML part only.The delivery PEC notification is issued on
   behalf of every recipient of the message, and MUST follow the format
   described in section 4.3.

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


   The MIME structure of the original message is unaltered as it is 
   added to the notification, but each MIME part with a "name" 
   parameter in the header field "Content-Type," or a "filename" 
   parameter in the header field "Content-Disposition" MUST be 
   substituted by a text file containing that MIME part's hash value.

   When the original message has an S/MIME format, it is necessary 
   not to alter the integrity of the message structure. Verification 
   of the S/MIME part in the original message takes place when the MIME
   type of the top-level entity (which coincides with the message
   itself) is checked. An S/MIME message MAY have the following MIME 
   types (as per [SMIMEV3]): 

   o multipart/signed 

     Represents an original message signed by the sender using the 
     structure described in [MIME-SECURE]. The message is made up of 2 
     MIME parts: the first is the message itself before the application
     of the sender's signature, whereas the second contains signature 
     data. The second part (generally of type "application/pkcs7-
     signature" or "application/x-pkcs-signature") contains data added 
     during the signing phase and MUST be left unchanged to avoid 
     compromising the overall message structure; 

   o "application/pkcs7-mime" or "application/x-pkcs7-mime" 

     The message is composed of a sole CMS object within the MIME part.
     Given that attachments cannot be separated from the CMS object, 
     the MIME part is left intact (i.e., it is not replaced by the hash
     value); therefore, the brief PEC notification is the same as the 
     complete PEC notification. 

   If the original message contains parts whose Content-Type is 
   "message/rfc822", i.e. contains an email message as attachment, the
   entire attached message is substituted with its corresponding hash
   value. 

   Therefore, when emitting a brief delivery PEC notification, the 
   provider MUST: 

   1. Identify and extract all the parts from the first MIME 
      part of the multipart/signed S/MIME message; 

   2. calculate the hash values of all the files attached by the sender
      to the original message; 

   3. substitute originals with their hash values. 

   In general, in the case of original messages in S/MIME format, the

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


   copy of the message inserted within the brief delivery PEC 
   notification will have the following characteristics: 
     
   o if the original message is signed, the S/MIME structure and 
     signature-relative data will remain unchanged. The message will 
     generate an error in a future signature integrity verification 
     phase following the substitution of attachments with the 
     corresponding hash values. 

   o if the original message contains the "application/pkcs7-mime" or 
     "application/x-pkcs7-mime" MIME type, attachments present in the 
     message will not be substituted by their hash values, due to 
     impossibility of identification within a CMS structure. 
     The content of the brief delivery PEC notification will coincide 
     with that of a normal delivery PEC notification. 

   The algorithm used for hash calculation is the [SHA1], calculated on
   the entire content of the part. To allow distinction between hash 
   files and the files to which they refer, the suffix ".hash" is added
   to the original filename. The hash value is written in the file 
   using a hexadecimal representation as a single sequence of 40 
   characters. The MIME type of these attachments is set to 
   "text/plain" to highlight their textual nature. 

3.3.2.3. Delivery PEC notification: concise 

   If the PEC transport envelope contains the header 

        X-TipoRicevuta: sintetica 
     
   the delivery point emits, both to primary and carbon copy 
   recipients, a concise delivery PEC notification that does not 
   contain the original message. 

   The message body of the notification contains a readable text part
   according to a model that relates the following certification data: 

        Concise delivery PEC notification 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), the message "[subject]" 
        originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to

   The same certification data is inserted within an XML file and 
   added to the notification (section 4.4), along with additional 
   parts that MAY be included for provider-specific services. Parsing

   follow the format described in section 4.3.
   
   The concise delivery PEC notification follows the same emission 
   rules as the delivery PEC notification; added to it is only the XML
   file containing the certification data, not the original message.

3.3.3. Non-delivery PEC notification 

   If an error occurs during the delivery of a correct PEC transport 
   message, the system returns to the sender a non-delivery PEC 
   notification that indicates the error condition. 

   The header will contain the following fields: 

        X-Ricevuta: errore-consegna 
        Date: [date of notification emission] 
        Subject: AVVISO DI MANCATA CONSEGNA: [original subject] 
        From: certified-mail@[mail_domain] 
        To: [original sender] 
        X-Riferimento-Message-ID: [Message-ID of original message] 

   The notification body contains a readable text part according to a 
   model that relates the following data: 

        Non-delivery PEC notification 
        On [date] at [time] ([time zone]), in the message "[subject]" 
        originating from "[original sender]" and addressed to 
        "[recipient]" 
        an error was detected. 
        The message was refused by the system. 
        Message identification:  [Message-ID] 

   The same certification data is inserted within an XML file and 
   added to the notification in order to allow for automatic checks 
   (section 4.4). Parsing MUST be done on the XML part only. Additional
   parts MAY be included by the PEC provider for provider-specific 
   services. The notification MUST follow the format described in 
   section 4.3.

3.4. Sender and receiver belonging to the same domain 

   PEC messages MUST be processed even if both sender and receiver(s) 
   belong to the same PEC domain. 
  
3.5. Example: Complete transaction between 2 PEC domains 

   A correct transaction between two PEC domains goes through the 
   following steps:

   o The sending user sends an email to his provider's Access Point;

   o The Access Point runs all checks and emits an acceptance PEC 
     notification to the user; 

   o The Access Point creates a PEC transport envelope and forwards it 
     to the Incoming Point of the receiving provider; 

   o The receiver's Incoming Point verifies the PEC transport envelope 
     and creates a take in charge PEC notification to be sent to the 
     sending provider; 

   o The sender's Incoming Point verifies the validity of the take in 
     charge PEC notification and forwards it to the Delivery Point; 

   o The sender's Delivery Point saves the take in charge PEC 
     notification in the provider's service mailbox; 

   o The receiver's Incoming Point forwards the PEC transport envelope 
     to the receiver's Delivery Point; 

   o The receiver's Delivery Point verifies the contents of the PEC 
     transport envelope and saves it in the recipient's mailbox; 

   o The receiver's Delivery Point creates a delivery PEC notification 
     and sends it to the sender's Incoming Point; 

   o The sender's Incoming Point verifies the validity of the delivery 
     PEC notification and forwards it to the sender's Delivery Point; 

   o The sender's Delivery Point saves the delivery PEC notification in
     the sending user's mailbox; 

   o The receiving user has the message at his disposition. 
   
   NOTE: Some of these steps might occur in parallel, thus the 
   interaction might complete in a different order.

4. Formats 

4.1. Temporal reference 

   For all operations carried out during message, notification, and 
   log elaboration processes by the access, incoming and delivery 
   points, it is necessary to have an accurate temporal reference 
   available. All events (generation of PEC notifications, transport 
   envelopes, logs, etc) that constitute the transaction of message 
   elaboration at the access, incoming, and delivery points MUST employ
   a sole temporal value obtained from within the transaction itself.

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


   Doing this renders the instant of message elaboration unambiguous 
   within PEC logs, notifications, messages, etc, generated by the 
   server. 
   
4.2. User date/time 

   Temporal indications supplied by the service in readable format 
   (text in PEC notifications, transport envelopes, etc) are provided 
   with reference to the legal time at the moment of the operation.  
   Following is the specification using the syntax description notation
   definted in [ABNF].
   
   date-fullyear   = 4DIGIT
   date-month      = 2DIGIT  ; 01-12
   date-mday       = 2DIGIT  ; 01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31 based on
                             ; month/year
   time-hour       = 2DIGIT  ; 00-23
   time-minute     = 2DIGIT  ; 00-59
   time-second     = 2DIGIT  ; 00-58, 00-59, 00-60 based on leap second
                             ; rules
   time-offset     = "(" ("+" / "-") time-hour ":" time-minute ")"

   partial-time    = time-hour ":" time-minute ":" time-second

   full-date       = date-mday "/" date-month "/" date-fullyear
   full-time       = partial-time time-offset
   
   NOTE: For number of days in a month, leap year, and leap second 
         restrictions see section 5.7 of [TIMESTAMP].

4.3. Format of a PEC message body 

   This section describes the characteristics of the various components
   of PEC messages and notifications generated by a PEC system. If one 
   of the message parts contains characters with values outside of the 
   range 0-127 (7-bit ASCII), that part will have to be adequately 
   encoded so that 7-bit transportation compatibility is guaranteed 
   (e.g. quoted-printable, base64 as per [MIME1]). 
   
   Before applying the signature, the message body has 
   Content-Type: multipart/mixed. Each part is described in the sections
   below. The first part is the user readable text generated by the PEC
   system, while the second and third parts are interchangeable in 
   order and contain the original message and the XML file for the 
   certification data.

4.3.1. User readable text

   Character set: ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) 
   MIME type: text/plain or multipart/alternative

   The multipart/alternative MIME type MAY be used to add an HTML 
   version of the body of system-generated messages. In this case, two 
   sub-parts MUST be present: one of type text/plain, the other 
   text/html. For the HTML part: 

   o it MUST contain the same information as related in the text part; 
 
   o it MUST NOT contain references to elements (e.g. images, sounds, 
     font, style sheets) neither internal to the message (added MIME 
     parts) nor external (e.g. hosted on the provider's server); 

   o MUST NOT have active content (e.g. JavaScript, VBscript, Plug-in, 
     ActiveX).
     
4.3.2. Original message 

   MIME type: message/rfc822 
   Attachment name: postacert.eml 

4.3.3. Certification data 

   Character set: UTF-8 
   MIME type: application/xml

4.5. PEC providers directory scheme 

   The PEC providers directory is created through a centralized LDAP 
   server that contains the providers' data and their corresponding PEC
   mail domains. 
   
   Following are the directory scheme's attributes:

   - providerCertificateHash: hash of provider's certificate
   

   
Gennai et al.            Expires February 08, 2011            [Page 36]

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


   - providerCertificate: provider certificate
   
   - providerName: provider name

   - mailReceipt: provider reception email address
     
   - managedDomains: managed domains

   - LDIFLocationURL: provider LDIF record URL

   - providerUnit: secondary operating environment name  

   The directory's base root is "o=postacert" and the 
   "DistinguishedName" of single records is of the type 
   "providerName=<name>, o=postacert". Search within the directory is 
   carried out mainly in case-sensitive mode using the 
   "providerCertificateHash" attribute (during envelope signature 
   verification phase) or the "managedDomains" attribute (during 
   message acceptance phase). It is possible for the record of a single
   provider to contain multiple "providerCertificate" with the related 
   "providerCertificateHash" attributes in order to allow the handling 
   of the renewal of expiring certificates. The provider MUST make sure
   to update its record with sufficient advance before the certificate
   expiration date, by adding a new certificate whose validity overlaps
   that of the previous one. 
   
   The data of all PEC providers is encompassed in a [LDIF] file which
   is available as an [HTTPS] object, and can be found at the URL to 
   which the 'LDIFLocationURL' attribute in the "dn: o=postacert" record
   points (see section 4.5.6). To guarantee authenticity, that file  
   MUST be signed by the provider for the operations regarding its PEC 
   services using the method described for single providers. The file, 
   the signature, and the X.509v3 certificate MUST be inserted in a 
   PKCS#7 structure in binary ASN.1 DER format as a file with ".p7m" 
   extension. The centralized [LDAP] system downloads that file on a 
   daily basis and, after suitable verifications of the signature, 
   applies it to the provider's record.
   
   Through the [LDIF] file, single providers MUST keep a copy of the
   directory locally, updated on a daily basis, in order to improve 
   system performance by avoiding continuous request dispatches to the 
   central system for every message elaboration phase. 

   If secondary environments are present, the [LDIF] file indicated in 
   the main environment's record MUST relate the contents of all the 
   provider-relevant records.

   The Certificate Binary transfer ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.8 ) 
   syntax is defined in RFC 2252.
   
   NOTE: By the time this draft is written, and after PEC had several
         implementations up and running, RFC 2252 was rendered obsolete

5. Security-related aspects 

5.1. Digital signature 

   It is recommended that a dedicated hardware module be used to handle
   private key and signature operations, the specifications of which
   are outside the scope of this document. It's up to the PEC providers
   to conform to security requisites expected for the service.

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


5.2. Authentication 

   User access to PEC services through the access point MUST be allowed
   only upon successful user authentication on the system.
     
   For example, authentication might use user-ID and password, or, if 
   available and considered necessary for the type of service provided,
   an electronic ID card or the national services card. Choice of 
   authentication method is left to the better judgment of the service 
   provider. Authentication is necessary to guarantee as much as 
   possible that the message is sent by a PEC user whose identification
   data is congruent with the specified sender, so as to avoid 
   falsification of the latter. 

5.3. Secure interaction 

   To guarantee that the original message remains unaltered during 
   transaction, envelopment and signature are applied on outgoing 
   messages at the access point, and subsequent verification of 
   incoming messages is done at the incoming point.

   All communications within the PEC network MUST use secure channels. 
   Integrity and confidentiality of connections between PEC provider 
   and user MUST be guaranteed through the use of secure protocols, 
   such as those based on [TLS] and those that create a secure 
   transport channel on which non-secure protocols can transmit (e.g. 
   IPSec).

   The interaction between providers MUST take place using SMTP on 
   [TLS], as per [SMTP-TLS]. The incoming point MUST provide and 
   announce its support for the STARTTLS extension, as well as accept 
   both unencrypted connections (for ordinary mail) and protected ones.
   To guarantee complete traceability in the flow of PEC messages, 
   these MUST NOT transit on systems external to the PEC network. When 
   exchanging messages between different providers, all transactions 
   MUST take place between machines that belong to the PEC network or 
   are directly managed by the provider. An "MX" type record MAY be 
   associated to each PEC domain defined within the system for name 
   resolution, in which case secondary reception systems specified in 
   that record MUST be under direct control of the provider. All in 
   conformance with [SMTP].

5.4. Virus 

   Another important security aspect that concerns the PEC system, is 
   related to the technical and functional architecture which MUST 
   block the presence of viruses from endangering the security of all 
   handled messages. It is therefore REQUIRED to have installations and
   continuous updates of anti-virus systems that hinder infections as

   much as possible without intervening on the content of the certified
   mail, in compliance with what has been discussed thus far. 

5.5. S/MIME certificate 

   In this document the S/MIME certificate profile is defined for use 
   in the certification of PEC messages done by the providers. The 
   proposed profile of the S/MIME certificate is based on the IETF 
   standards [SMIMECERT] and [CRL], which in turn are based on the 
   standard ISO/IEC 9594-8:2001. 

5.5.1. Provider-related information (subject) 

   The information related to the PEC provider holder of the 
   certificate MUST be inserted in the "Subject:" field (Subject DN). 
   More precisely, the Subject DN MUST contain the PEC provider's name 
   as it is in the "providerName" attribute published in the PEC 
   providers directory (section 4.5), but the Subject DN does not have 
   to match the Provider entry DN in the LDIF. The providerName MUST be
   present in the CommonName or OrganizationName attributes of the 
   Subject field in the certificate.

   Certificates MUST contain an Internet mail address, which MUST 
   have a value in the subjectAltName extension, and SHOULD NOT be 
   present in the Subject Distinguished Name.

   Valid subjectDN are: 

        C=IT, O=AcmePEC S.p.A, CN=Posta Certificata 

        C=IT, O=ServiziPEC S.p.A, CN=Posta Certificata 

   Valorization of other attributes in the Subject DN, if present, 
   MUST be done in compliance with [CRL]. 

5.5.2. Certificate extensions 

   Extensions that MUST be present in the S/MIME certificate are: 

   o Key Usage 

   o Authority Key Identifier 

   o Subject Key Identifier 

   o Subject Alternative Name 

   The Basic Constraints extension (Object ID:2.5.29.19) MUST NOT be 
   present.

Internet-Draft           Certified Electronic Mail            July 2010


   The valorization of the above listed extensions for the described 
   profile follows. 

   The Key Usage extension (Object ID: 2.5.29.15) MUST have the 
   digitalSignature bit (bit 0) activated and MUST be marked as 
   critical. The extension MAY contain other active bits corresponding 
   to different Key Usage, as long as that doesn't contrast with the 
   indications in [CRL]. 

   The Authority Key Identifier (Object ID:2.5.29.35) MUST contain 
   at least the keyIdentifier field, and MUST NOT be marked as 
   critical.

   The Subject Key Identifier extension (Object ID: 2.5.29.14) MUST 
   contain at least the keyIdentifier field, and MUST NOT be marked as 
   critical. 

   The Subject Alternative Name (Object ID: 2.5.29.17) MUST contain 
   at least the rfc822Name field, and MUST NOT be marked as critical. 

   Adding other extensions that have not been described in this 
   document is to be considered OPTIONAL, as long as it remains 
   compliant with [CRL]; such added extension MUST NOT be marked as 
   critical. 

5.5.3. Example 

   Following is an example of an S/MIME certificate compliant with 
   the minimal requisites described in this profile. Values used are 
   of fictitious providers generated for example purposes only. 

5.5.3.1. General-use certificate in annotated version 

   An asterisk near the label of an extension means that such an 
   extension has been marked as critical.

5.6. PEC providers directory 

   The contents of the PEC providers directory MUST be queried via 
   [HTTP] on SSL, as described in [TLS], exclusively by licensed 
   providers that have the necessary user certificates; this access 
   modality guarantees authenticity, integrity and confidentiality 
   of data. 
   Each provider downloads the LDIF file through an [HTTPS] session,
   which is authenticated by checking the X.509 certificate issued by a
   certification authority.

6. PEC system client technical and functional prerequisites 

   This section lists the prerequisites that must be respected by a 
   client in order to guarantee the minimal operative functionalities 
   to the user of a general PEC system: 

   o handling of access and delivery points through secure channels; 

   o handling of user authentication in message dispatch and reception
   which make use of standard protocols, such as [IMAP], [POP3] and 
   [HTTP];

   o support for MIME format according to [MIME1] and [MIME5]; 

   o support for "ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)" character set; 

   o support for S/MIME v3 standard, as in [SMIMEV3], for verification 
     of signatures applied to PEC envelopes and notifications. 

7. Security Considerations 

   All security considerations from [CMS] and [SMIMEV3] apply to 
   applications that use procedures described in this document. 

   The centralized LDAP server is a critical point for the security of 
   the whole PEC system. An attack could compromise the whole PEC 
   system. PEC providers that periodically download the LDIF file

   SHOULD use the best security technology to protect it from local 
   attacks. A PEC provider could be compromised if an attacker changed 
   a certificate or modified the list of domains associated 
   to it in the LDIF file that was copied to the PEC provider system. 

   When verifying the validity of the signature of a message, the 
   recipient system SHOULD verify that the certificate included in the 
   [CMS] message is present in the LDIF file (section 4.5), and that 
   the domain extracted by the [EMAIL] "From:" header is listed in the 
   managedDomains attribute associated to said certificate. 

8. IANA Considerations 

8.1. Registration of PEC message header fields

   This document defines new header fields used in the messages that
   transit in the PEC network. As specified and required by 
   [HEADERS-IANA], this document registers new header fields as 
   Provisional Message Header Fields as follows.

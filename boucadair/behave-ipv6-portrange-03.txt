Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  IPv4 Address Exhaustion

   It is commonly agreed by the Internet community that the exhaustion
   of public IPv4 addresses is an ineluctable fact.  Regular alarms and
   reports have been emitted by the IETF particularly by the reports
   presented within the GROW working group (Global Routing Operations
   Working Group) meetings.

   G. Huston introduced an extrapolation model to forecast the
   exhaustion date of IPv4 addresses managed by IANA.  This effort
   indicates that if the current tendency of consumption continues at
   the same pace, IPv4 addresses exhaustion of IANA's pool would occur
   in 2011, while RIRs'pool would be exhausted in mid-2012.  The state
   of the current consumption of public IPv4 addresses is daily updated
   and is available at this URL:
   http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html.

1.2.  To what extent does IPv6 solve the problem?

   In this context, the community was mobilized in the past to adopt a
   promising solution (in particular with the definition of IPv6).  IPv6
   has been introduced for several years as the next version of the IP
   protocol.  This new version offers an abundance of IP addresses as
   well as several enhancements compared to IPv4.  IPv6 specifications
   are mature and current work within the IETF is related to operational
   aspects.  Despite this effort, IPv6 is not globally activated by
   service providers for both financial and strategic reasons.

   However, even if a service provider activates IPv6, it will be
   confronted with the problem to ensure a global connectivity towards
   nowadays Internet v4.  Mechanisms such as NAT-PT (Network Address
   Translation Protocol Translation) were introduced to ensure the
   interconnection between two heterogeneous realms (i.e.  IPv4/IPv6)
   and to ensure a continuity of IP communications (i.e.  End-to-end).
   These solutions are stateful and are not suitable to interconnect an
   IPv6 domain with a dominant Internet which is IPv4-only.  Further
   work should be undertaken with IETF to elaborate lightweight and
   hopefully stateless solution to ease IPv4-IPv6 interconnection.
   Moreover, Service providers should adopt clear strategies so as to
   ease the adoption of IPv6 and to decrease the complexity related to
   IPv4-IPv6 interconnection which is one of the critical issues to be
   taken into account when designing service platforms.

   Last, it is worth to mention that migrating to IPv6 is a service
   provider issue and not the one of its customers.  The ultimate
   requirement of the customers (mainly residential and mass market) is



Boucadair, et al.         Expires April 8, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


   to benefit from a global IP connectivity.  How this connectivity is
   engineered and put into effect is of the business of the IP
   connectivity service providers.  Of course, some corporate customers
   would specify the nature of their IP connectivity and reduce the
   interconnection engineering complexity of their interconnection nodes
   with the domain of their IP connectivity service provider(s).  From
   this standpoint, service providers should be more proactive in order
   to avoid a crisis scenario where no IP addresses are available to be
   assigned to their customers.

1.3.  Towards a proactive approach

   The introduction of IPv6 into public networks becomes a reality.
   Several Internet providers have enabled IPv6 in their routers and
   launched therefore their IPv6 migration operations.  The portion of
   the IPv6-enabled routers differs between SPs.  The current trade is
   that operators offer dual connectivity to their customers, i.e.  IPv4
   and IPv6 access.  IPv4 connectivity usage should be gradually
   decreased in favour of IPv6 one.  This convergence phase towards a
   pure IPv6 connectivity will take several years depending on the
   policies adopted by service providers.  For operators that adopt an
   aggressive position with regards to the activation of IPv6, this
   transition phase could be small compared to passive operators.
   Nevertheless the overall Internet IPv6 coverage will be long.  This
   is due mainly to the significant number of involved actors to be
   convinced for a full migration towards IPv6, the significant number
   of existing ASes (more than 30000), etc.  Moreover, customers do not
   have any reason to modify their local architecture (e.g., a given
   organisation does not have any motivations to migrate its FTP or HTTP
   servers towards IPv6).  Operators must expect a long work of
   accompaniment for the migration towards IPv6.  The final migration
   towards IPv6 would take several years (at least 10 years).

   This migration to IPv6 should be incremental and not implemented in
   one shot.  For these reasons, service providers should elaborate
   migration scenarios so as to achieve a transparent migration.  This
   transparency is required because end-users should not be aware on the
   underlying technology used to deliver their subscribed services and
   the complexity related to service engineering should be hidden to
   end-users.  Furthermore, service providers should use means to
   prioritise IPv6 traffic and the invocation of IPv6 transfer
   capabilities without relying on end-users behaviour.  IPv6 transfer
   capabilities should be exploited and not considered as dormant ones.
   If no proactive means/procedures are adopted, the ratio of IPv6
   traffic will depend on the behaviour of end-users and also on
   available IPv6 services.

   Furthermore, in the perspective of IPv6 migration, the maintenance

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


   and the operating of dual connectivity infrastructure would therefore
   be required for a long period.  This option is not to be encouraged
   within service providers since it does not optimise both OPEX/CAPEX.
   Both technical skills should be maintained within each individual
   organisation.  As an alternative, this document proposes a proactive
   and incremental deployment approach which consists at:

   - Activation of IPv6 and port range IPv4 solution at the same time.
   Port-restricted devices are provisioned with an IPv6 prefix, a shared
   IPv4 public address and a port range.

   - Activation of stateless functions and use of IPv6 to carry IPv4
   traffic from/to port-restricted devices.

   - Migration to IPv6-only core network.

   - Maintain stateless IPv4-IPv6 interconnection functions at
   interconnection segment to not alter intra-domain paths.

1.4.  Contribution of this draft

   This memo defines several solutions to solve the IPv4 address
   shortage problem and to migrate to IPv6 without requiring stateful
   nodes.  It proposes also several migration paths.  This target IPv6
   deployment is a long term objective and can be reached incrementally
   through one or several intermediate steps.  These intermediate steps
   perimeters differ from a service provider to another one depending on
   the service opportunities targeted by enabling IPv6-related
   capabilities and also on the level of risks on the already running
   (IPv4-based) services.  Risks on existing services should be
   assessed.  Careful or aggressive position may be adopted by each
   service provider.  Service providers are free to deploy the step/the
   migration path suitable to their context and objectives, etc.  This
   document only sketches scenarios and interconnection configurations.
   Voluntarily, no frozen architecture is described.  Several options
   are supported.

   This document provides:

   o  solution specification

   o  and deployment scenarios together with migrations paths.

1.5.  Positioning this Draft

   This draft proposes a solution to solve both IPv4 address exhaustion
   and IPv4-IPv6 interconnection.  Unlike
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], no additional NAT is required to



Boucadair, et al.         Expires April 8, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


   be deployed at the service provider's network.  Both encapsulation
   and translation modes are presented in this memo.

   A set of issues related to IPv4 Internet access in the context of
   public IPv4 address exhaustion are identified and described in
   [I-D.levis-behave-ipv4-shortage-framework].


2.  Terminology

   Within the context of this draft, the following terminology is used:

   o  Access segment: This segment encloses both IP access and backhaul
      network.  Within this document, this access segment encompass an
      access PoP.

   o  Core network: Denotes a set of IP networking capabilities and
      resources which are between the interconnection and the access
      segments.

   o  Interconnection segment: Includes all nodes and resources which
      are deployed at the border of a given AS (Autonomous System) a la
      BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

   o  PRR: Stands for Port Range Router.  This function is responsible
      to handle a port-based routing.  This function may retrieve the
      port value and use it to determine which routing action is to be
      executed or use it together with the destination IP address to
      build an IPv6 address.

   o  Interconnection PRR (i-PRR): A PRR which is deployed at
      interconnection segment.

   o  Access PRR (a-PRR): A PRR which is deployed at access segment.

   o  SMAP: Stands for Stateless A+P Mapping.  This function is
      responsible to encapsulate (Resp. decapsulate), in a stateless
      scheme, IPv4 packets in (Resp. from) IPv6 ones.  A SMAP function
      may be hosted in a PRR, end-user device, etc.

   o  Port-restricted device (PRD): A device which is able to constrain
      its source port number to be within a given Port Range.  A port
      restricted device may be of several types such as:

      *  CPE (Customer Premise Equipment)/HGW (Home Gateway)

      *  PDA (Personal Digital Assistant)

      *  Mobile terminal


3.  Reminder of the Port Range Solution

   This section is a reminder of the solution presented in
   [I-D.boucadair-port-range].

   The main principle of the solution is to assign the same IP address
   (called Primary IP Address) to several end-users' devices and to
   constraint the source port numbers to be used by each device.  In
   addition to the assigned IP address to access IP connectivity
   services, an additional parameter, called Port Range, is also
   assigned to the customer's device.  For outbound communications, a
   given port restricted device proceeds to its classical operations
   except the constraint to control the source port number assignment so
   as to be within the Port Range.  The traffic is then routed without
   any modification inside the Service Provider's domain and delivered
   to its final destination.  For inbound communications, the traffic is
   trapped by a dedicated function called: Port Range Router (PRR).
   This function may be embedded in current routers or hosted by new
   nodes to be integrated in the IP infrastructure of these service
   providers.  Appropriate routing tuning policies are enforced so as to
   drive the inbound traffic to cross a PRR.  Each PRR correlate the
   Primary IP Address and information about the allowed port values with
   a specific identifier called: routing identifier (e.g., Private IPv4
   address, IPv6 address, point-to-point link identifier, etc).  This
   routing identifier is used to route the packets to the suitable
   device among all those having the same IP address.

   Port-restricted devices are provisioned with port range to be used,
   especially the Port Mask to be applied when selecting a port value as
   a source port.  A Port Mask defines a set of ports that all have in
   common a subset of pre-positioned bits.  This set of ports is also
   called Port Range.  Two port numbers are said to belong to the same
   Port Range if and only if, they have the same Port Mask.  A Port Mask
   is composed of a Port Range Value and a Port Range Mask.

   o  The Port Range Value indicates the value of the significant bits
      of the Port Mask.  The Port Range Value is coded as follows:

      *  The significant bits may take a value of 0 or 1.

      *  All the other bits (non significant ones) are set to 0.

   o  The Port Range Mask indicates, by the bit(s) set to 1, the
      position of the significant bits of the Port Range Value.

   [I-D.boucadair-port-range] proposes to assign the same public IPv4
   address together with a port range to several devices.  In order to
   discriminate those devices, an additional identifier called, routing
   identifier, is required.  This identifier may be a secondary IPv4
   address, PPP session identifier, etc.  This document assumes that
   this identifier is an IPv6 address.  This prefix is built using IPv4-
   related information as illustrated in Figure 2.

   1.  The length of this prefix is recommended to be less than 64 bits;

   2.  Pref6: is a sub-prefix belonging to the service provider or well-
       known prefix allocated by IANA for this service.  The length of
       this field is variable (may be different from a service provider
       to another if not allocated by IANA).  The Pref6 prefix used to
       build an IPv4-mapped IPv6 prefix may not be the same as the one
       used to execute the IPv4-to-IPv6 mapping function introduced in
       Section 4.2.

   3.  @IPv4 field encloses the shared IPv4 address.  The length of this
       field is 32 bits;

   4.  PRM field includes the value of the significant bits of the Port
       Range.  The maximum length of this field is 16 bits.  But, in
       deployment scenarios this field may be 3, 4 or 5 bits.  If n bits
       are used to build the PRM, the same IPv4 address may be shared
       between 2^n port-restricted devices.

   For illustration purposes two examples are provided below.

   Let suppose that a service provider dedicates the 2a01:c0a8::/29 to
   build an IPv4-inferred IPv6 prefix.  In this example, we suppose that
   8 port restricted devices share the same public address
   193.51.145.206 owing to a port range mask with three significant bits
   (i.e. the three first bits are used to build the port mask.  The
   remaining 13 bits may take a 0 or 1 value ), yielding 8192 (2^16/2^3)
   possible ports per each port-restricted device.  The corresponding
   IPv6Pref prefixes for these 8 port-restricted devices are thus the
   following ones:

4.2.1.  Overview

   Within this memo, IPv4-to-IPv6 address mapping function denotes a
   function which uses IPv4-related information, as conveyed in a
   received IPv4 packet, to generate IPv6 one.  This function generates
   an IPv6 address which builds as illustrated in Figure 3.

   o  Pref6 is configured by the service provider.

   o  Then, the next 32 bits are set to the value of the destination
      IPv4 address;

   o  The next 16 bits are set to the value of the destination port
      number;

   o  The remaining bits are then set to zeros.

                      Figure 3: Pref6A Address Format

4.2.2.  Example

   Let suppose that a given device is provided with the Pref6 prefix
   equal to 2a01:c0a8::/29.  Then the corresponding IPv6 address, using
   the IPv4-to-IPv6 address mapping function, to the IPv4 address equal
   to 193.51.145.206 and the port number equal to 19039
   (0100101001011111) is the following:

IPv6PrefA=2a01:c0a 1 11000001001100111001000111001110 0100101001011111 ::

IPv6PrefA=2a01:c0aE:099C:8E72:52F8::/128


   This IPv6 address falls in the IPv6 prefix of the second port-
   restricted device (port range 001) as listed in the previous section.

4.3.1.  Overview

   Unlike the previous function, the IPv6-to-IPv4 address mapping
   functions generates an IPv4 address together with a port number from
   the header and the transport part of a received IPv6 packet as
   follows:

   o  The destination IPv4 address corresponds to the 32 bits which
      follow a per-configured Provider prefix;

   o  Destination port number is equal to the one of the received IPv6
      packet.

4.3.2.  Example

   Let suppose that the Pref6 prefix equal to 2a01:c0a8::/29 is used.
   Then the corresponding IPv4 address, resulting from the IPv6-to-IPv4
   address mapping function applied to the address 2a01:c0aE:099C:8E71:

5.  Stateless A+P Mapping Function

5.1.  Stateless A+P Mapping gateway (SMAP) Function description

   Stateless A+P Mapping gateway (SMAP) consists in two basic functions
   as described in Figure 4.

   1.  SMAP encapsulates an IPv4 packet, destined to a shared IPv4
       address, in IPv6 one.  The IPv6 source address is constructed
       (see Section 4.2) from the IPv4 source address and port number
       plus the IPv6 prefix which has been provisioned to the node
       performing the SMAP function.  The destination IPv6 address is
       constructed using the shared IPv4 destination address and port
       number plus the IPv6 prefix which has been provisioned to the
       SMAP function and which is dedicated to IPv4 destination
       addresses.

   2.  SMAP extracts IPv4 incoming packets from IPv6 incoming ones which
       have IPv6 source addresses belonging to the prefix of the node
       performing the SMAP function.  Extracted IPv4 packets are then

       forwarded to the point identified by the IPv4 destination address
       and port number.

             Figure 4: Stateless A+P Mapping Gateway Function

   A SMAP-enabled node will perform the stateless 6/4 mapping function
   for all public shared IPv4 addresses for which it was designated as a
   stateless 6/4 mapping gateway.

   To perform stateless 6/4 mapping function a SMAP gateway must:

   o  be provided with an IPv6 prefix (i.e., Pref6).  The SMAP gateway
      uses this prefix to construct IPv6 source addresses for all IPv4
      shared addresses for which it was designated as a SMAP gateway.
      The IPv6 prefix may be provisioned statically or dynamically
      (e.g., DHCP)

   o  be able to know the IPv6 prefix of the node serving as another
      SMAP gateway for IPv4 destination addresses.  This prefix may be
      known in various ways:

      *  Default or Well known prefix which was provisioned statically
         or dynamically;

      *  Retained at the reception of incoming IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulated
         packets;

      *  Discovered at the communication starting thanks to mechanisms
         as DNS resolution for example.

   When the SMAP-enabled node receives IPv4 packets with IPv4 source
   addresses for which it was not designated as a SMAP gateway, it will
   not perform stateless 6/4 mapping function for those packets.  Those
   packets will be handled in a classical way (i.e., forwarded, dropped

   or locally processed).

   When the SMAP-enabled node receives IPv6 packets with IPv6 addresses
   which do not match with its IPv6 prefix, it will not perform the
   stateless 6/4 mapping function for those packets.  Those packets will
   be handled in a classical way (i.e., forwarded, dropped or locally
   processed).

5.2.  Implementation modes

   Stateless mapping function may be achieved in two main modes.  Those
   modes consist in mapping the traffic only in one direction or in the
   two directions as described below.

5.2.1.  SMAP to route incoming traffic destined to a shared IPv4 address

   IPv4 traffic with shared IPv4 source addresses are forwarded by the
   node A without performing stateless mapping function.  This traffic
   will reach its destination thanks to a classical routing.  In the
   opposite direction, the traffic sent by the destination has to pass
   by the node B which performs the stateless mapping function
   (encapsulating in IPv6 packets) before forwarding to the node A. The
   node A performs the stateless mapping function (extract IP v4
   packets) before forwarding IPv4 packets to the points identified by
   the IPv4 destination addresses and port number.  In this case, both
   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic are routed in the network between the nodes A
   and B.

5.2.2.  No IPv4 capabilities are used anymore between two SMAP-enabled
        nodes

   In this configuration, the node A performs the stateless mapping
   function on the received IPv4 traffic (encapsulated in IPv6 packets)
   before forwarding to the node B. The node B performs the stateless
   mapping function on the received IPv6 traffics (extracting IPv4
   packets) before forwarding the IPv4 traffic to the destination
   identified by the IPv4 destination address and port number.  In the
   opposite direction and as previously, the node B performs the
   stateless mapping function on the received IPv4 traffics
   (encapsulating in IPv6 packets) before forwarding to the node A. The
   node A performs the stateless mapping function on the received IPv6
   traffic (extracting IPv4 packets) before forwarding the IPv4 traffic
   to the point identified by the IPv4 destination address and port
   number.  In this case, only IPv6 traffic is managed in the network
   segment between the nodes A and B.

5.3.  Deployment Scenarios

   Several deployment scenarios of the SMAP function may be envisaged in
   the context of Port Range based solutions:

   o  A SMAP function is embedded in a port-restricted device.  Other
      SMAP-enabled nodes are deployed in the boundaries between IPv6-
      enabled realms and IPv4 ones.  This scenario may be particularly
      deployed for intra-domain communications so as to interconnect
      heterogeneous realms (i.e., IPv6/IPv4) within the same AS.

   o  A SMAP function is embedded in a port-restricted device.  Other
      SMAP-enabled nodes are deployed in the interconnection segment



Boucadair, et al.         Expires April 8, 2010                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


      (with adjacent IPv4-only ones) of a given AS.  This deployment
      scenario is more suitable for service providers targeting the
      deployment of IPv6 since it eases the migration to full IPv6.
      Core nodes are not required to activate anymore both IPv4 and IPv6
      transfer capabilities.

   Other considerations regarding the interconnection of SMAP-enabled
   domains should be elaborated.  The following provides a non
   exhaustive list of interconnection schemes.

   o  The interconnection of two domains implementing the SMAP function
      may be deployed via IPv4 Internet (Figure 7): This means that IPv4
      packets encapsulated in IPv6 one are transferred using IPv6 until
      reaching the first SMAP-node.  Then these packets are de-
      encapsulated and are forwarded using IPv4 transfer capabilities.
      A remote SMAP-enabled node will receive those packets and proceeds
      to an IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation.  These packets are then routed
      normally until reaching the port-restricted devices which de-
      encapsulates the packets.

   o  A second scheme is to interconnect two realms implementing the
      SMAP function using IPv6 (Figure 8).  Two sub-scenarios are
      identified:

      *  An IPv6 prefix (i.e., Pref6) assigned by IANA is used for this
         service.  If appropriate routing configuration have been
         enforced, then the IPv6 encapsulated packets will be routed
         until the final destination.

      *  If an IPv6 belonging a service provider prefix is used.  This
         will be covered in the next versions of the document.

   Within this draft, a PRR-enabled node implements both SMAP function
   and required functions to handle fragmentation and other protocols
   which do not require a transport protocol.  More details about
   fragmentation may be found at [I-D.boucadair-port-range].

   In the remaining part, the text refers only to PRR and not SMAP.


6.  IPv6 Migration Scenarios

6.1.  Overview

   This section proposes a set of migration steps in the context of IPv4
   address exhaustion and IPv6 deployment.  Both objectives are taken
   into account.

   The proposed steps are informational.  An analysis of these steps and
   proposed IPv6 migration paths are discussed in Section 6.7.

   The following figure (i.e., (Figure 9)) provides an overview of
   network segments and the localisation of PRR-enabled nodes.  One or
   several PRR may be enabled.  PRD1 and PRD2 are two port-restricted
   devices which have been provisioned with the same IP1 public address
   and two distinct port ranges (PR1 and PR2).

                     Figure 9: Reference Architecture

6.2.  IPv6 Prefixes and Addresses

   Different types of IPv6 prefixes and addresses are used in the scope
   of the solutions described in the document (i.e., Step_0
   (Section 6.4), Step_1 (Section 6.5) and Step_2 (Section 6.6)).
   Theses prefixes and addresses are listed hereafter:

   1.  IPv6Pref: A prefix allocated to the port-restricted device.  A
       packet sent to addresses belonging to this prefix are routed
       toward this port-restricted device.  IPv6Pref prefix addresses
       may also be used to send and receive native IPv6 traffic.  In
       stateless IPv6-IPv4 Address Mapping mode (as explained above),
       the IPv6Pref structure is related to the IPv4 address plus port
       range.  In binding mode, IPv6Pref and IPv4 address plus port
       range are independent.

   2.  IPv6PrefA: An address belonging to IPv6Pref prefix used to send
       IPv4-in-IPv6 traffic.

   3.  Pref6: An IPv6 prefix (e.g., /24, /32) common to all of the IPv6
       packets which must be routed to a PRR function.  It is for
       further study to decide whether this prefix is to be:

       A.  Service provider scope

       B.  or common to all service providers (to be defined by IANA).

       Both alternatives are compatible with the proposed solutions.

   4.  Pref6A: An address belonging to the Pref6 prefix.  A Pref6A
       address includes the Pref6 prefix on its left most part followed
       by the destination IPv4 address and destination port number, as

       a-PRR has to transform a destination address Pref6A to a
       destination address IPv6PrefA, it proceeds as illustrated in

                Figure 10: Fetching IPv6PrefA from WKIPv6A

   The following sections describe three migration steps and a set of
   proposed migration paths.  The proposed solutions are stateless at
   interconnection segment.  A binding table may be implemented to meet
   requirements of service providers which do not want to closely
   correlate their IPv6 address plan and the IPv4 one.  More details are
   provided below.

6.3.  On Stateless and Binding Table Modes

6.3.1.  Stateless Mode

   Complete stateless mapping implies that the IPv4 address and the
   significant bits coding the port range are reflected inside the IPv6
   prefix assigned to the port-restricted device.  Two alternatives are



Boucadair, et al.         Expires April 8, 2010                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


   offered when such a stateless mapping is to be enabled:

      - either using the IPv6 prefix already used for native IPv6
      traffic,

      - or provide two prefixes to the port-restricted device: one for
      the native IPv6 traffic and one for the IPv4 traffic.

   Note that:

      - Providing two IPv6 prefixes has the advantages of allowing a /64
      prefix for the port-restricted device along with another prefix
      (e.g., a /56 or /64) for native IPv6 traffic.  This alternative
      spares the service provider to relate the native IPv6 traffic
      addressing plan to the IPv4 addressing plan.  The drawback is the
      burden to allocate two prefixes to each port-restricted device and
      to route them.  In addition, an address selection issue may be
      encountered.

      - Providing one prefix for both needs (e.g., a /56 or a /64)
      spares the service provider to handle two types of IPv6 prefix for
      the port-restricted device and in routing tables.  But the
      drawback is that it somewhat links strongly the IPv4 addressing
      plan to the allocated IPv6 prefixes.

6.3.2.  Binding Table Mode

   Another alternative is to assign a "normal" IPv6 prefix to the port-
   restricted device and to use a binding table, which can be hosted by
   a service node, to correlate the (shared IPv4 address, Port Range)
   with an IPv6 address part of the assigned IPv6 prefix.  For
   scalability reasons, this table should be instantiated within PRR-
   enabled nodes which are close to the port-restricted devices.  The
   number of required entries if hosted at interconnection segment would
   be equal to the amount of subscribed users (one per port-restricted
   device).

   The stateless mode is recommended.

6.4.  Step_0: IPv6 at Access Network

   This step is described in [I-D.boucadair-port-range].  This step
   assumes that IPv6 is used to convey incoming traffic to its final
   destination.  For this reason, an IPv6 address is used as the routing
   identifier.  More information about this step is provided below.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


6.4.1.  Context

   This step can be deployed at earlier stages of IPv6 deployment.  The
   impact on routing (especially path optimisation) and also offered
   services is the same as for the Port Range solution described in
   [I-D.boucadair-port-range].  The service brokenness risk is
   optimized.  IPv6 is used in this step as a means to convey incoming
   IPv4 traffic.  Within this step, IPv6 is used in the access segment
   to deliver the received IPv4 traffic.

   When this step is deployed, at least 50% of the handled traffic
   (incoming+outgoing), at the IP access segment, of a service
   provider's domain is achieved using IPv6 capabilities.  IPv4
   capabilities are used only for outgoing traffic.

   Native IPv6 connectivity may also be offered to end-users.

6.4.2.  Overall Procedure

   This section discusses additional points related to IPv6 usage in the
   context of the Port Range solution described in
   [I-D.boucadair-port-range].

6.4.2.1.  Provisioning Operations

   This section lists the set of information required for a port-
   restricted device to access the connectivity service.

6.4.2.1.1.  IP Connectivity Information

   Each port-restricted device is assigned with:

   1.  A shared public IPv4 address.  In addition to this address, a
       port range is also assigned to the device.

   2.  An IPv6 prefix: denominated in the rest as IPv6Pref.  This prefix
       is allocated to the port-restricted device and it is used to
       discriminate (a given device) among all those having the same
       public IPv4 address.  This address may be used also to send and
       receive native IPv6 traffic or a second prefix may be assigned
       specific for native IPv6 traffic.

6.4.2.1.2.  Provisioning procedure

   To convey IPv4 configuration information, one of these solutions may
   be implemented:





Boucadair, et al.         Expires April 8, 2010                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


   1.  Activate DHCP and support port range options as described in
       [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign];

   2.  Use PPP and support the IPCP Port Range Configuration Options as
       specified in [I-D.boucadair-pppext-portrange-option].

   To convey IPv6 configuration information, DHCPv6 [RFC3315] may be
   activated.  When several IPv4-inferred IPv6 address structures are
   supported, options defined in
   [I-D.boucadair-dhcpv6-shared-address-option] can be used.

6.4.2.2.  Port Restricted Device's behaviour and supported functions

   A port-restricted device may be a host, a CPE, etc.

6.4.2.2.1.  Port Restriction Behaviour

   The behaviour of the port-restricted device is as follows:

   1.  If the port-restricted device hosts a NAT function: For incoming
       traffic, the port-restricted device checks if the destination
       port number is within the Port Range, otherwise the packet is
       dropped.  When the destination port number of a received packet
       (from outside the LAN) falls inside the Port Range, classical NAT
       operations are enforced and the packet is then routed to its
       final destination in the LAN.

   2.  Otherwise, the port-restricted device is an end-user host: the
       device restricts its source port numbers to be with the assigned
       Port Range.  Received IPv4 packets with a destination port number
       outside the Port Range must be dropped.

6.4.2.2.2.  Handling Outgoing traffic

   The same procedure as described in [I-D.boucadair-port-range]
   applies.  In addition to the normal NAT operations, the port-
   restricted device ensures that the source port number is within the
   allowed Port Range.

6.4.2.2.3.  Handling Incoming traffic

   For incoming traffic, two cases may be considered:

   1.  IPv6 encapsulated traffic: for encapsulated IPv6 packets, the
       port-restricted device de-encapsulates the packets and extracts
       the embedded IPv4 one.  The original IPv4 packets is then treated
       and handled locally.  If the destination port of that packet is
       within the Port Range of that port-restricted device, and



Boucadair, et al.         Expires April 8, 2010                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


       depending on the local NAT implementation if any, the packet may
       be accepted and then proceed to classical NAT operation.
       Otherwise, the packet is dropped.

   2.  IPv6 native traffic: No constraint is required.  The traffic
       should be routed to it final destination, if the port-restricted
       device is a CPE.

6.4.2.3.  PRR Behaviour

6.4.2.3.1.  Supported functions

   In addition to the functions listed in [I-D.boucadair-port-range],
   the PRR must support an IPv6 encapsulation function.

6.4.2.3.2.  Localization

   The PRR function is deployed under the same conditions as the ones
   discussed in [I-D.boucadair-port-range].

6.4.2.3.3.  Behaviour

   The PRR intervenes only for incoming traffic destined to a shared
   IPv4 address.

   a.  If a binding table is implemented: This binding table stores the
       required information to route the traffic destined to a shared IP
       address to the appropriate port-restricted device among all those
       sharing the same IP address.  An IPv6 prefix may be used as
       routing identifier.  In this case, the structure of the binding
       table is: (shared IPv4 address, Port Range) ==> IPv6 prefix.
       Instead of the IPv6 prefix itself (IPv6Pref), the binding table
       may contain a specific address under IPv6Pref (called in the rest
       IPv6PrefA).  When a binding table is adopted, the IPv6 prefix
       assigned to a port-restricted device is not constrained.  There
       is no need for the service provider to allocate two different
       IPv6 prefixes to the port-restricted devices (one for native IPv6
       traffic and another one for the IPv4 encapsulated traffic).  Only
       one may suffice for the two needs.

   b.  Stateless mapping: The service provider assigns an IPv4 shared
       address, a port range and an IPv6 prefix with IPv6 prefix
       containing explicitly the IPv4 address and the significant bits
       of the port range (i.e., Bits used to built the Port Range Mask,
       see [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign]).  When a stateless mapping is
       adopted, it is possible that the service provider has to cope
       with constraints when allocating the IPv6 prefix and the shared
       IPv4 address to the port-restricted devices.  As a matter of fact



Boucadair, et al.         Expires April 8, 2010                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


       the IPv6 prefix must reflect the shared IPv4 address.
       Alternatively the service provider may instead allocate two
       different prefixes for the two needs (IPv6 native traffic and
       IPv4 encapsulated traffic).

   In the remaining part of this section, "PRR retrieves the
   corresponding IPv6 prefix address" means that:

   a.  If a binding table is implemented: the PRR looks-up through this
       table and retrieves the IPv6Pref or IPv6PrefA corresponding to
       (IPv4 address, Port Range).  If IPv6Pref is retrieved, the PRR
       builds an IPv6Pref address in complementing the IPv6Pref with a
       fixed bit sequence chosen by the service provider to be always
       the same complementary bit sequence for all port-restricted
       devices. .

   b.  Stateless mode: an IPv6 prefix address (i.e., IPv6PrefA) is built
       using the IPv4 address and the destination port number.

   In both cases, when the PRR has got/built the corresponding IPv6PrefA
   , the PRR encapsulates the original packets in an IPv6 one with a
   destination IP address equal to the IPv6Pref address.  The source
   IPv6 address is an address of the PRR.  It may be an anycast IPv6
   address or unicast one.

   This packet is then routed according to instantiated IGP routes.

6.4.2.4.  Routing considerations

   The same IGP considerations as detailed in [I-D.boucadair-port-range]
   should be taken into account.  In addition to these considerations,
   IPv6 routes should be installed to reach port-restricted devices from
   an IPv6-enabled PRR.

6.4.3.  Focus on Communication Establishment

6.4.3.1.  Outgoing IPv4 Communications

   Outgoing IPv4 traffic is handled as described in
   [I-D.boucadair-port-range].  The traffic issued from a port-
   restricted device is routed to its final destination.  The traffic is
   not altered and is transferred to its final destination.

6.4.3.2.  Incoming IPv4 Communications

   Owing to IGP configuration, the traffic destined to a shared IP
   address must cross a PRR.  This latter encapsulates the received IPv4
   packets in IPv6 ones as described in Section 6.4.2.3.3.  The traffic



Boucadair, et al.         Expires April 8, 2010                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


   is then routed using the IPv6PrefA as a destination address.  The
   traffic is received by the device among those sharing the same IPv4
   address (because this port-restricted device is allocated with this
   IPv6Pref).  A de-encapsulation operation is then executed as
   described in Section 6.4.2.2.  If the de-encapsulated IPv4 traffic is
   destined to a port within the assigned Port Range, the traffic is
   accepted, otherwise it is dropped.

6.4.3.3.  Outgoing IPv6 Communications

   Since the port-restricted device is IPv6-enabled, native IPv6
   communications may be offered.  This assumes that the service
   provider has deployed means for IPv6 transfer capability.  The same
   prefix used to convey incoming IPv4 traffic (IPv6Pref) may be used
   also to send and receive native IPv6 traffic.  Alternatively, a
   second IPv6 prefix may be assigned to that purpose.

6.4.3.4.  Incoming IPv6 Communications

   Native IPv6 communications are supported.

6.4.4.  Typical Flow Example

   In order to illustrate this step, let consider the example shown in
   the following figure (Figure 11).  M1 is a machine behind a port-
   restricted device (called CPE as Customer Port restricted Equipment
   in the example and Figure 11).

   M1 wants to establish an IPv4 communication with RM (Remote Machine).
   To do so, an IPv4 packet is issued by M1.  This packet has as source
   IP address equal to Pri_IPv4.  The packet is then received by CPE.
   This latter enforces its NAT operations.  As a result, an IPv4 packet
   with a source IP address equal to Pub_IPv4 and a source port number
   within the Port Range of CPE is sent.  The resulting packet is
   forwarded according to IPv4 transfer capabilities until reaching its
   final destination RM.

   As a response, RM sends an IPv4 packet destined to Pub_IPv4 and a
   destination port number equal to the source port number of the
   received packet.  This message is received by PRR.  The PRR
   encapsulates the received IPv4 packet in an IPv6 one.  The resulting
   IPv6 packet is then forwarded.  The encapsulated packet is received
   by the appropriate CPE among those having the same IPv4 address.  A
   de-encapsulation is enforced.  The original IPv4 packet is extracted.
   Once classical NAT operations are executed, the CPE forwards the IPv4
   packet to M1.

6.5.  Step_1: IPv6 a Means to Transfer Incoming IPv4 Packets

6.5.1.  Context

   Step_1 is characterized by the activation of two levels of PRR
   functions in several segments of a given service provider's network.
   Some PRR-enabled nodes are deployed close to the port-restricted
   devices (e.g., In the access or backhaul network) whilst others are
   installed at the interconnection segment of the service provider's
   network as shown in Figure 9.

   The objective of this step is to maximize the invocation of IPv6
   capabilities, particularly to convey incoming IPv4 traffic until
   delivery to final destination (e.g., port-restricted device).

6.5.2.  Overall Procedure

   Step_1 works exactly the same way as that the Step_0, apart what is
   specified in this section.  In particular, there are none difference
   between Step_0 and Step_1 at the level of the port-restricted device.

6.5.2.1.  Routing considerations

      - a-PRR: As in Step_0, a-PRR announces the shared IPv4 prefixes it
      serves.  In addition, in case of binding table mode, it announces
      in IGP the aggregates of all the Pref6A addresses of the port-
      restricted devices it serves so that IPv4-in-IPv6 packets reach
      this a-PRR.

      - i-PRR: i-PRR announces in EGP (if embedded in an ASBR node) or
      in IGP (if deployed behind an ASBR), all (aggregated) IPv4
      prefixes of all port-restricted devices it can route packets to
      (via a-PRR in case of binding table).  Depending of the structure

      of the service provider network, some i-PRR-enabled nodes may be
      positioned inside the service provider network to encapsulate more
      IPv4 traffic into IPv6.  For example, from a region A to another
      region B of the service provider's network.

6.5.2.2.  Behaviour of a-PPR and i-PRR

   Figure 12 show the respective role of a-PRR and i-PRR-enabled nodes.
   The labels of the arrows are explained in further sub-sections.

      - CPE1 (Customer Port restricted Equipment) is a port-restricted
      device 'served' by a-PRR (means that a-PRR announces in IGP the
      assigned shared IPv4 address to CPE1).

      - CPE2 is a device of another customer connected to the network
      managed by the same service provider.  It may be either another
      port-restricted device or a device with a plain IPv4 address.

      - RM is a remote machine located outside the AS managed by the
      service provider.

                   Figure 13: Step_1: Binding table mode

6.5.2.2.1.  Localization

   The PRR function is deployed under the same conditions as in Step_0
   but as previously mentioned more PRR-enabled nodes are deployed
   within the service provider's network.

6.5.2.2.2.  Stateless Mapping Mode

   In case the service provider assigns an IPv4 shared address, a port
   range and an IPv6 prefix containing explicitly the IPv4 address and
   the significant bits of the port range, i-PRR-nodes are able to build
   the IPv6Pref address of the port-restricted device using the IPv4
   destination address and destination port bits of received IPv4
   packets.

   Hence, i-PPR behaviour is the same one as the PRR one described in
   Step_0, when stateless mapping is enforced.  In that case, the IPv4-
   in-IPv6 packet does not pass through the a-PRR but it is routed
   directly to the port-restricted device (e.g., To CPE1 as depicted in
   Figure 12).

6.5.2.2.3.  Binding Table Mode

   This behaviour is illustrated in Figure 13.

   If a binding table is implemented within a-PRR, i-PRR-enabled nodes
   can not hold all the binding table entries corresponding to all the
   port-restricted devices it may route traffic for.  Consequently, it
   has to route the IPv4 traffic towards the a-PRR of which the port-

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


   restricted device depends.  More precisely, a given i-PRR
   encapsulates the incoming IPv4 traffic in IPv6 packets using the
   following addresses:

      - The source IPv6 address is one of the global IPv6 addresses of
      the i-PRR.

      - The destination IPv6 is built by i-PRR using an address under
      the Pref6 prefix conforming to the formalism defined in
      Section 4.2.  This address, called Pref6A, includes the Pref6
      prefix on its left most part and the destination IPv4 address and
      destination port number in this right most part.

   Thus, an i-PRR-enabled node routes normally this IPv4-in-IPv6 packet
   (labeled Pref6A_Enc (Pub_IPv4_In) in Figure 13) using IPv6 transfer
   capabilities.  The packet is routed towards the a-PRR serving the
   recipient port-restricted device (CPE1 is Figure 13) since
   appropriate routing configuration has been enforced (see
   Section 6.5.2.1).

   Upon receipt of that packet, the a-PRR proceeds as follows:

      - It retrieves the IPv4 shared address and port bits parts of the
      Pref6A address.  Then, with these parts it looks-up through its
      binding table to fetch the IPv6PrefA corresponding to the couple
      (IPv4 address, Port Range).

      - Once retrieved, the a-PRR positions the IPv6PrefA address as the
      destination address in place of the Pref6A address and forwards
      the packet.  The IPv4-in-IPv6 packet is routed until reaching the
      port-restricted device (CPE1 in Figure 13).

   As shown in Figure 13 (bottom part), when another machine (CPE2)
   within the same service provider's domain sends traffic to the port-
   restricted device CPE1, the working of a-PRR is the same one as that
   of the PRR is Step_0.

6.6.  Step_2: Only IPv6 Is Used For Both Incoming and Outgoing Traffic

6.6.1.  Context

   This step is suitable for service providers wishing to migrate to
   full IPv6 and to offer a global connectivity using IPv6.  This step
   provides a lightweight procedure to interconnect IPv6 with IPv4
   realms.  This procedure may be fully stateless or require a binding
   table.  This table does not include session-based information.

   Only IPv6 connectivity is used inside the service provider's domain;

   IPv4 capabilities are deactivated.  No parallel IPv4 and IPv6
   operational tasks will be maintained anymore in the core segment.

   Two implementation modes may be envisaged:

   1.  Encapsulation-based mode: This mode suggests using both inbound
       and outbound IPv6 encapsulation to carry IPv4 traffic (received
       from the remaining IPv4-only realms).  This mode is almost
       similar to Step_1 for handling incoming IPv4 packets.  Unlike
       Step_1, the required operations to build the outgoing
       encapsulated packets is also supported in this step.

   2.  Translation-based mode: Unlike the first mode, this one assumes
       that there is no need to maintain both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks in
       the CPE.  It is recommended to implement this mode when mature
       IPv6 deployment has been observed and that IPv6 realms become
       more important than IPv4-only ones.

   More information about these two modes is provided in the sub-
   sections hereafter.

6.6.2.  The IPv6 Encapsulation-Based Mode

6.6.2.1.  Provisioning Operations

6.6.2.1.1.  IP Connectivity Information

   In addition to the information required for Step_1, a Pref6 IPv6
   prefix may e configured on the port-restricted device.  This prefix
   is to be used when running the IPv4-to-IPv6 mapping function required
   to encapsulate IPv4 traffic in IPv6 one.

6.6.2.1.2.  Provisioning Procedure

   Idem as Step_1.

6.6.2.2.  Routing Considerations

   IPv4 IGP protocols are not anymore enabled in the core network.  Only
   IPv6 routing table is maintained by involved routers.

   Inter-domain IPv4 connectivity is maintained with IPv4-only realms.
   IPv4 network prefixes are mapped to IPv6 prefixes (using a Pref6
   configured by the service provider) which are injected in the
   deployed IPv6 IGP protocol.

   A given a-PRR MUST advertise in IGP the aggregated IPv6 prefixes it
   handles.  Doing so, all intra-domain IPv6 packets will cross that

   PRR.

6.6.2.3.  Port Restricted Device's Behaviour and Supported Functions

6.6.2.3.1.  Port Range Restriction

   Idem as Step_1.

6.6.2.3.2.  Handling Outgoing Traffic

   Unlike Step_1, outgoing IPv4 traffic is encapsulated in IPv4-in-IPv6
   packets.  Concretely, the port-restricted device executes its port
   restricted NAT operations (if any).  The resulting IPv4 packet is
   then encapsulated in an IPv6 packet.  The port-restricted device
   selects an IPv6 address from its assigned IPv6 prefix (IPv6Pref).
   This address IPv6PrefA is used as the source IPv6 address of the
   encapsulated packet.

   Two options may be considered to build the destination IPv6 address
   of the encapsulated packet as listed below:

   1.  The port-restricted device is provisioned to use an anycast IPv6
       address.  This anycast IPv6 address is configured on internal
       interfaces of all PRRs.  This mode is may be implemented when the
       port-restricted device is not able to build a destination IPv6
       address reflecting the IPv4 address and port of its correspondent
       (i.e., the port-restricted device does not support the mapping
       function defined in Section 4.2).

   2.  The port-restricted device is able to build an IPv6 address using
       a Pref6 prefix (which may be distinct than the one used to build
       mapped IPv6 prefixes by i-PRRs), the destination IPv4 address and
       the destination port number.

   No constraints are to be followed for outgoing native IPv6 traffic.

6.6.2.3.3.  Handling Incoming Traffic

   Idem as Step_1.

6.6.2.4.  PRR Behaviour

6.6.2.4.1.  Supported Functions

   In addition to the functions supported in Step_1, an IPv4-in-IPv6 de-
   encapsulation function must be supported by a-PRR.

6.6.2.4.2.  Localization

   Idem as Step_1.

6.6.2.4.3.  Behaviour: Stateless Mode

   The behaviour of both access and interconnection PRRs is elaborated
   below:

   1.  If an anycast IPv6 address is configured on interfaces of all
       a-PRRs:

       *  An (access) PRR will receive the encapsulated packet issued
          from port-restricted devices.  The packet is de-encapsulated
          and the original IPv4 one is retrieved.  Then, the (access)
          PRR builds a destination IPv6 address using a Pref6 prefix,
          the destination IPv4 address and the destination port number.
          The original IPv4 packet is then encapsulated in IPv6 packet
          with a source IPv6 address of the (access) PRR and the
          destination IPv6 address equal to the newly built one.  The
          packet is forwarded to next hop according to IPv6 routing
          table.  If the correspondent is not a port-restricted device,
          the packet is intercepted by a-PRR or a i-PRR depending of
          where the correspondent is located.  This a-PRR or i-PRR
          proceeds to the de-encapsulation operation.  The extracted
          IPv4 packet is then forwarded to the IPv4 correspondent.  This
          encapsulated packet is received by an (access/
          interconnection) PRR which proceeds to a de-encapsulation
          operation.  The extracted IPv4 packet is then forwarded to the
          next IPv4 hop.

       *  Incoming IPv4 traffic is intercepted by an (interconnection)
          PRR.  The PRR encapsulates the received IPv4 packet in an IPv6
          one using the following information:

          +  The source IPv6 address is one of the global IPv6 addresses
             of the PRR.

          +  The destination IPv6 is built by the PRR using the
             formalism defined in Section 4.2.  This address is build
             using a Pref6 prefix, the destination IPv4 address and the
             destination port number.  The appropriate port-restricted
             device, among those having the same IPv4 address, will
             receive the packet.  This is illustrated in Figure 14.

   2.  Otherwise, all internal IPv4 traffic is encapsulated by the port
       restricted device in IPv4-in-IPv6 packets (the destination IPv6
       address is the one built by the port-restricted device, see
       Section 4.2).  As in the first bullet, the packet is forwarded to
       next hop according to IPv6 routing table.  If the correspondent
       is not a port-restricted device, the packet is intercepted by
       a-PRR or a i-PRR depending of where the correspondent is located.
       This a-PRR or i-PRR proceeds to the de-encapsulation operation.
       The extracted IPv4 packet is then forwarded to the IPv4
       correspondent.  The same behaviour as for the first bullet
       applies for incoming IPv4 traffic.  A flow is illustrated in
       Figure 15.

   The behaviour of both access and interconnection PRRs is elaborated
   below:

   1.  If an anycast IPv6 address is configured on interfaces of all
       a-PRRs:

       *  An (access) PRR will receive the encapsulated packets issued
          from port-restricted devices.  The packets are de-encapsulated
          and the original IPv4 is retrieved.  Then, the (access) PRR
          builds a destination IPv6 address using a Pref6 prefix and the
          destination IPv4 address.  The original IPv4 packets are then
          encapsulated in IPv6 packet with a source IPv6 address of the
          (access) PRR and the destination IPv6 address equal to the
          newly built one.  The packet is forwarded to next hop
          according to IPv6 routing table.  The packet is intercepted by
          a-PRR or a i-PRR depending of where the correspondent is
          located.  This a-PRR or i-PRR proceeds to the de-encapsulation
          operation.  The extracted IPv4 packet is then forwarded to the
          IPv4 correspondent.

       *  Incoming IPv4 traffic is intercepted by an (interconnection)
          PRR.  The PRR encapsulates the received IPv4 packet in an IPv6
          one using the following information:

          +  The source IPv6 address is one of the global IPv6 addresses
             of the PRR.

          +  The destination IPv6 is built by the PRR using the
             formalism defined in Section 4.2.  This address is build
             using a Pref6 prefix, the destination IPv4 address and the
             destination port number.  The appropriate a-PRR managing
             the destination port-restricted device, among those having
             the same IPv4 address, will receive the packet.  This is
             illustrated in Figure 16.  The PRR de-encapsulates the
             packet and retrieves the original IPv4 packet.  The access
             PRR retrieves the destination address IPv6PrefA stored in
             its binding table and forwards the packet to the port
             restricted device.

   2.  Otherwise, all internal IPv4 traffic is encapsulated by the port
       restricted device in IPv4-in-IPv6 packets.  As in the first
       bullet, the packet is forwarded to next hop according to its IPv6
       routing table.  The packet is intercepted by a-PRR or a i-PRR
       depending of where the correspondent is located.  This a-PRR or
       i-PRR proceeds to the de-encapsulation operation.  The extracted
       IPv4 packet is then forwarded to the IPv4 correspondent.  The
       same behaviour as for the first bullet applies for incoming IPv4
       traffic.  A flow example is illustrated in Figure 17.

6.6.3.  The IPv6 Translation-Based Mode

6.6.3.1.  Context and Conditions

   This mode assumes that IPv6-only terminals are deployed behind port-
   restricted devices.  Particularly, all DNS resolution requests are
   AAAA ones [RFC3363] .  Only IPv6 addresses are conveyed in DNS
   responses to requesting machines.

   A dedicated ALG should be supported by the DNS infrastructure
   deployed by the service provider.  The main function of this ALG is
   to form an IPv6 address based on a Pref6 prefix and a resolved IPv4
   address, when no AAAA RR are available in the DNS system (following
   the formalism described in Section 4.2).  The Pref6 prefix is
   configured by the service provider so as to identify that the
   resulting IPv6 address is not a native one.  We refer to this IPv6
   prefix as Pref6_v4.  The procedure is illustrated in Figure 18.

   retrieved an IPv6 address to contact.

                        Figure 19: Translation Mode

   Intra-domain communications are placed using IPv6 transfer
   capabilities.  When the remote destination is an IPv4 (which is
   represented by an IPv6 address), the following exchanges are
   observed:

   1.  M1 issues an IPv6 message destined to RM.

   2.  Once received by the CPE, this latter checks if the destination
       address belongs to the Pref6_v4 prefix.  If this is the case, a
       NAT66 operation is executed.  As a result, a new IPv6 packet is
       generated.

   3.  This message is received by the interconnection PRR.  It
       retrieves IPv4 information based on IPv6 one and translates the
       packet to a new IPv4 one.

   4.  This message is then routed using IPv4 capabilities of the
       connected IPv4-only realm.

   5.  Once received by RM, an answer may be issued.  An IPv4 packet is
       then sent.

   6.  This IPv4 packet is received by i-PRR.  It then proceeds to a
       stateless NAT46 operation.  The newly built IPv6 packet is
       forwarded to the next hop.

   7.  Owing to underlying IGP configuration, the packet is received by
       the appropriate CPE which checks its NAT66 table.

   8.  Because a session has been instantiated, a NAT66 operation is
       executed.  The resulting IPv6 packet is then received by M1.

6.6.3.3.1.  IP Connectivity Information

   Unlike previous steps, no IPv4 connectivity is provided to customers.
   None IPv4 packets are sent, neither by the end-user's device within
   the LAN nor by the CPE itself.

   IP connectivity is exclusively offered owing to IPv6 transfer
   capabilities.  Thus, no IPv4 connectivity information is conveyed to
   end-user's device.  In the meantime, an IPv6 prefix (IPv6Pref) is
   assigned to the end-user device (CPE or terminal).  This assigned
   IPv6 prefix follows the constraints listed in Section 4.

   As already mentioned in Section 6.3, the service provider may
   allocate to the customer's device a second prefix IPv6 prefix which
   is not IPv4-mapped.

6.6.3.3.2.  Provisioning Procedure

   In addition to what has been mentioned for Step_1 (IPv6 part), a
   specific policy should be installed so as to "guide" the behaviour of
   the NAT66 function introduced in "Handling Outgoing Traffic" section.

   This specific policy needs to be aware of the port range allocated to
   the port-restricted device.  It is for further study to defined how
   the port range can be allocated through IPv6 means (e.g., through a
   new DHCPv6 option).

6.6.3.4.  Port Restricted Device's Behaviour and Supported Functions

6.6.3.4.1.  Port Range Restriction

   The port restriction is applied only if the destination IPv6 address
   belongs to the Pref6_v4 prefix.  Otherwise, no port restriction is
   enforced, since it is assumed to be a native IPv6 communication.

   A new NAT66 function should be supported by the CPE.  This NAT66 is
   not required to be supported if a directly connected terminal is
   used.  But then, its address selection process should follow the
   recommendations listed in "Handling Outgoing Traffic" sub-section.

6.6.3.4.2.  Handling Outgoing Traffic

   The following procedure is applied:

   o  If the destination IPv6 address belongs to the Pref6_v4 prefix
      (this means the destination is not a native IPv6 host and an IPv6-
      IPv4 interconnection node will be crossed in the delivery path),
      the port-restricted device proceeds to NAT66 operations.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


      Concretely:

      *  A port number from the Port Range is selected, this port
         replaces the original source port number in the transport part
         of the received IPv6 packet;

      *  A source IPv6 address IPv6PrefA is selected under IPv6Pref (see
         Section 4) in such a way that the port value contained in the
         port part of this IPv6PrefA address is equal to the selected
         port number;

      *  The received IPv6 (from a machine in the LAN) packet is then
         translated to a new IPv6 one with the newly built IPv6PrefA
         address as source address and the newly selected source port
         number in transport part.

   o  Otherwise, the packet is forwarded to the next IPv6 hop.

6.6.3.4.3.  Handling Incoming Traffic

   The following procedure is applied:

   o  If the source IPv6 address belongs to the Pref6_v4 prefix, the
      port-restricted device proceeds to NAT66 operations according to
      its active NAT sessions.

   o  Otherwise, the packet is forwarded to the next IPv6 hop in the
      LAN.

6.6.3.5.  PRR Behaviour

6.6.3.5.1.  Supported Functions

   Unlike previous steps, no encapsulation function is required to be
   supported by the PRR.  Nevertheless, a stateless IPv6-IPv4 (and vice
   versa) translation must be supported.

6.6.3.5.2.  Localization

   No PRRs are required anymore to be maintained in the access segment.
   Only PRRs located in the interconnection segment should be deployed.
   These nodes should be near ASBRs used to interconnect with IPv4-only
   realms.

6.6.3.5.3.  Behaviour

   The behaviour of the PRR is as follows:

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Port Range                October 2009


   1.  Traffic received from an IPv4-only realm: The PRR extracts
       destination IPv4 address, source IPv4 address, destination port
       number and source port number.  A new IPv6 packet is generated
       following these rules:

       *  The destination and source port numbers of the generated
          packet are the same as the original IPv4 one.

       *  The destination IPv6 address follows the formalisms described
          in Section 4.2 using a Pref6 configured by the service
          provider.

       *  The source IPv6 address follows the formalism described in
          Section 4.2 using a Pref6 provided by the service provider.

   2.  Traffic destined to an IPv4-only realm: A new IPv4 packet is
       generated according to these rules:

       *  The destination and source port numbers of the generated
          packet are the same as the original IPv6 one.

       *  The destination IPv4 address is extracted from the destination
          IPv6 address of the received IPv6 packet.  See Section 4.3 for
          more information about the used IPv6-to-IPv4 address mapping
          function.

       *  The source IPv4 address is extracted from the source IPv6
          address of the received IPv6 packet using the IPv6-to-IPv4
          address mapping function defined in Section 4.3.

6.6.3.6.  Routing Considerations

   IPv4 IGP protocols are not anymore enabled in the core network.  Only
   IPv6 routing table is maintained by involved routers.

   Inter-domain IPv4 connectivity is maintained with IPv4-only realms.
   IPv4 network prefixes are mapped to IPv6 prefixes (using a Pref6
   prefix provided by the local service provider) which are injected in
   the IPv6 IGP deployed protocol.

6.7.  Analysis and IPv6 Migration Scenarios

   As aforementioned, the deployment of IPv6 is not a problem per se.
   The main issue is how to ensure a smooth interconnection between IPv4
   and IPv6 realms. interconnection functions and procedures should be
   deployed.  Currently proposed mechanisms rely on stateful
   interconnection nodes (e.g., NAT44 CGN or DS-lite CGN) or requires
   that dual-stack nodes (including end hosts and intermediary service

   nodes) are deployed everywhere.  The first category suffers from a
   performance issue and the second one is not realistic approach (since
   the adoption of IPv6 may require several years).

   This document presents solutions which solve the problem of IPv4
   address shortage and which prepare the migration to IPv6.  As
   described in previous sections, three steps have been identified and
   specified.  Table 1 gives an overview of the supported IP version per
   network segment and for each step.  The proposed solution requires
   the migration of core segments to IPv6.  Dual stacks would be
   maintained only at interconnection segments.  Table 2 presents the
   ratio of IPv6 traffic when the solution is deployed.  This table
   illustrates the invocation of IPv6 capabilities for the delivery of
   IP connectivity service.  Owing to the deployment of the proposed
   solution, service providers have deterministic means to increase IPv6
   traffic.

   (denoted as PRR in this document) are introduced first at access
   segment and then in the interconnection segment.  Intra-domain
   communications are optimised from an IGP perspective.  The presence
   of a-PRR allows a natural traffic distribution among deployed nodes.
   IPv4 traffic received from adjacent domains is handled by the i-PRR

   depending of the configuration (binding table with one line per port-
   restricted device or stateless mapping between shared IPv4 address
   and IPv6 prefixes).

   Various migration paths may be adopted by service providers based on
   backward compatibility considerations and also to the service
   portfolio.

   For service providers which offer already an IPv4-based connectivity
   service, several migration paths may be followed, depending on the
   service provider's objectives and profile, to adopt IPv6 without
   breaking global connectivity (i.e., Reach both IPv4 and IPv6 realms):

   1.  Deploy IPv6 with no major risks on currently offered services: a
       candidate migration path would be (ordered steps):

       A.  Deploy first the procedure described in
           [I-D.boucadair-port-range].  Then, IPv6 may be activated in
           the access segment when deploying Step_0.  Once IPv6 is
           deployed in core network, the service provider should
           activate Step_1 mainly by deploying PRR at interconnection
           segments.  Once the connectivity service is stable, a final
           step would be to adopt Step_2 (encapsulation mode) and then
           Step_2 (translation mode).

       B.  Deploy first Step_0, then adopt Step_1.  Once the service is
           stable, move to Step_2 (encapsulation mode) and latter to
           Step_2 (translation mode).

   2.  Aggressive position with regards to IPv6 deployment: For this
       category of service providers, the migration path would be either

       A.  either deploy Step_1 then Step_2 (encapsulation mode) and
           finally Step_2 (translation mode).

       B.  or deploy Step_2 (encapsulation mode) and then Step_2
           (translation mode).

   For new service providers which do not have backward compatibility
   requirement, the following deployment path may be adopted to ensure a
   global IPv4/IPv6 connectivity service.

      Deploy Step_2 (encapsulation mode) and then migrate to Step_2
      (translation mode).

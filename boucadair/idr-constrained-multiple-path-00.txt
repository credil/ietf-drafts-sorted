Abstract

   It is commonly agreed the continuous increase of routing tables is a
   sensitive issue which may question the sustainability of the
   Internet.  This document describes a solution which makes use of
   multiple paths without inducing drastic increase of routing tables.
   A constrained procedure to install additional paths in the RIB is
   described.  Multiple paths are installed according to rules agreed
   between adjacent peers and also based on external events (e.g., pro-
   active detection of link congestion).

Internet-Draft       Constrained Multiple BGP Paths         October 2010


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths] defines a procedure to support multiple
   paths.  The support of this feature may exacerbate the increase of
   routing tables which is seen as a critical issue for the
   sustainability of the overall Internet [I-D.irtf-rrg-recommendation]
   [I-D.narten-radir-problem-statement].

   In the meantime, allowing to store multiple paths in the RIB is
   motivated in several scenarios such as the following:

   o  Load balancing;

   o  Proactive reaction due to congestion events.  As an illustration,
      Figure 1 shows an architecture where three paths to reach D are
      received by AS2.  After applying the route selection process
      defined in [RFC4271], only R1 is selected.  This route is then
      propagated to AS1.  If AS3 experiences congestion on its link to
      AS7 for instance, part of the traffic is likely to be lost.  If
      the procedure described in this document is applied, then once a
      congestion event is observed in AS3 (local to an ASBR, intra-
      domain links, involved intra-domain routers or on inter-domain
      links) an UPDATE message is sent by AS3 to AS2 to notify a
      congestion by means of a dedicated flag in the extended NLRI.
      Once this UPDATE message is received by AS2, the route selection
      process is applied and an additional route is installed in the
      RIB.  An UPDATE message including the extended NLRI conveying two
      paths is then sent to AS1, R1 being tagged as a congested route
      (See Figure 2).  This document focuses on this use case.

1.1.  Contribution of this I-D

   This document proposes a constrained multiple path procedure which
   allows BGP peers to manage multiple paths towards a given destination
   in a controlled fashion.

   This document provides a scenario with congestion.  Other use cases
   could also be considered, such as QoS-inferred route tagging
   capabilities.

   This document re-uses some of the encodings proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths].


2.  Extended NLRI Encoding

   The current encoding defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths] does not
   allow to tag a specific enclosed path described in the Extended NLRI
   encoding.  The NLRI encoding depicted in Figure 3 is used in this
   document instead of the one specified in [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths].

                          Figure 3: Extended NLRI

   Except the Flag field, the remaining fields are similar to what is
   defined in Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths].

   The structure of the Flag field is shown in Figure 4.

   The first bit (called C bit) is used to indicate whether the path is
   congested (C=1) or not (C=0).  The remaining bits are set to 0.

   Further values can be defined in the future if required.


3.  Maximum Path Capability

   This section describes a new BGP Capability [RFC5492] called Maximum
   Path Capability.  The format of this new Capability is shown in
   Figure 5.

                    Figure 5: Multiple Paths Capability

   Multiple Paths Max field indicates the maximum number of multiple
   paths to a given destination prefix that can be supported by a given
   BGP peer.  The number of multiple paths that can be exchanged between
   two BGP peers MUST NOT exceed the Multiple Paths Max threshold.

   For the remaining fields, the same description as what is specified
   in Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths] is assumed.


4.  NOTIFICATION Error Code

   This document defines a new NOTIFICATION error code:

                          Error Code     Name
                          ---------- ------------
                          TBA        Maximum Path

   The following error subcode is defined:

                    Error SubCode         Name
                    ------------- --------------------
                    TBA           Maximum Path Reached


5.  Procedure

   The procedure for exchanging constrained multiple paths is as
   follows:

   o  During BGP session initialisation, a peer supporting the procedure
      described in this document includes the Maximum Path Capability in
      its Capability Set;

   o  A BGP speaker can advertise multiple paths to a BGP peer only if a
      Maximum Path Capability was included in its Capability Set
      received from an adjacent peer;

Internet-Draft       Constrained Multiple BGP Paths         October 2010


   o  Furthermore, if a BGP peer announces a number of routes towards a
      destination prefix that exceeds what has been negotiated during
      the OPEN phase, a NOTIFICATION message MUST be sent and SHOULD
      include an adequate Error Code/SubCode that corresponds to the
      exceeded multiple path threshold (See Section 4).

   o  Once the capability negotiation phase is completed, BGP peers
      adopt the normal BGP behaviour as specified in [RFC5492];

   o  Each AS would implement means/tools to monitor its intra and
      inter-domain links.  These tools are out of the scope of this
      document.  Once a threshold is reached (e.g., 75% of link
      utilisation), an event is sent to the ASBRs.  These nodes send
      UPDATE messages to their peers to notify them about the status of
      advertised routes.  C bit is set to 1 when a given route is seen
      as congested;

   o  Once this UPDATE is received by a BGP peer, it re-computes the
      routes to be installed in the RIB.  If the selected route is
      congested, a new route is added to the local RIB.  Both routes
      will be advertised using the extended NLRI to adjacent BGP
      speakers;

   o  This process can be re-iterated until reaching the maximum
      supported multiple paths.  Note that only one route with the flag
      C set to 0 is installed in the local RIB.  A local BGP speaker
      accept to install a new route if and only if the best route is
      congested; otherwise only one route is installed in the local RIB.

   o  The removal of alternative path can be undertaken by a BGP speaker
      according to local or external events.

   [[Note: The document does not elaborate on load balancing and how the
   traffic is distributed among available path.]]

   [[Note: For load banaling purposes, a metric can be conveyd to inform
   a BGP peer about the BW of the downstream interconnection link (i.e.,
   interconnection links with one hop adjacent ASes.]]


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests

   o  a new code for the Maximum Path Capability

   o  Maximum Path Error Notification code

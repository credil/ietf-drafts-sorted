Abstract

   This memo defines two new Instance Identifiers (Instance IDs) in
   IS-IS [RFC1195]).  These new Instance IDs [I-D.ietf-isis-mi] are
   meant to instantiate distinct IS-IS instances to convey routing
   information which is restricted to IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].  The ultimate goal of running
   separate instances for IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes is to isolate the IPv6
   routing table from the IPv4 routing table, and to avoid any overload
   due to the population of the table by IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes.  This
   isolation is motivated also from an operational perspective to allow
   the enforcement of specific routing policies for each topology.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft     IPv4 Mapped IPv6 IS-IS Instance ID       October 2009


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-isis-mi] specifies a mechanism to map each address family
   to a separate IS-IS [RFC1195] Instance identified by an ID.  Accepted
   ID values are 0 to 65535.  Instance ID#0 is used by default (legacy
   systems).  This document requests the assignment of two new MI-IS-IS
   Instance IDs for the following usages:

   o  Unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 IS-IS routing instance;

   o  Multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 IS-IS routing instance.

   Within the double context of IPv4 address exhaustion and the IPv6-
   IPv4 interconnection, numerous solutions are being elaborated within
   IETF.  Both translation (e.g., [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]
   and [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate]) and encapsulation (e.g.,
   [I-D.boucadair-dslite-interco-v4v6] and
   [I-D.boucadair-behave-ipv6-portrange]) schemes are proposed to
   facilitate IPv6-IPv4 interconnection.  These solutions require the
   injection of routes to IPv4-mapped IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] destination prefixes in intra-domain
   routing protocols.  In order to prevent any overload of the native
   IPv6 routing table with IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes, this memo defines
   new Instance IDs which are required for the activation of several
   IS-IS instances for unicast/multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6.  Such new
   instances are also meant to facilitate the operation of networks that
   convey IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and to ease the migration to full IPv6.
   As a result, when a separate IS-IS instance for unicast IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 address family is activated, a distinct IS-IS adjacency table is
   created, based on which unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes is computed.
   Likewise, when a separate IS-IS instance for multicast IPv4- mapped
   IPv6 address family is activated, a distinct IS-IS adjacency table is
   created for multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 route computation purposes.

   In case [RFC5120] is deployed, new Multi Topology IDs are required to
   be defined.  As a reminder, [RFC5120] specifies a mechanism to
   maintain multiple IS-IS topologies within the same IS-IS domain.
   This memo does not make any preference between the solution described
   in [RFC5120] and [I-D.ietf-isis-mi].  Network administrators have to
   make their decisions based on local policies and preferences.  If the
   multi-instance mechanism [I-D.ietf-isis-mi] is deployed in an IS-IS
   network as a preference for multiple topologies, the extensions as
   defined in this memo may be used to support unicast/multicast IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 routing, respectively.

2.  Procedure

   This document does not require any modification to the procedure
   specified in [I-D.ietf-isis-mi].  Nevertheless, only routes to IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 prefixes MUST be instantiated within a IPv4-mapped IPv6
   routing M-ISIS Concretely, the IANA prefix defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be supported by default.
   Service providers MAY also choose a LIR prefix to build the IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 addresses.


3.  Forwarding

   Only incoming datagrams destined to IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are
   associated (and therefore are forwarded) with the IPv4-mapped IPv6
   unicast/multicast IS-IS Instance, respectively.  WKP and/or LIR
   prefix defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be configured
   in all participating nodes.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following IS-IS Instance IDs:

   o  Instance ID# for IPv4-mapped IPv6 unicast AF;

   o  Instance ID# for multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 AF.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security issue in addition to
   those defined in [I-D.ietf-isis-mi].

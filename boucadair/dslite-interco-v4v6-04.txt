               Deploying Dual-Stack Lite in IPv6 Network
                 draft-boucadair-dslite-interco-v4v6-04

Abstract

   Dual-Stack lite requires that the AFTR must have IPv4 connectivity.
   This forbids a service provider who wants to deploy AFTR in an IPv6-
   only network.  This memo proposes an extension to implement a
   stateless IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation in the AFTR so that AFTR can be
   deployed in an IPv6-only network.

Internet-Draft              Extended DS-lite                   July 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  General

   Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) contains two major concepts: (1) Transport
   IPv4 packets over an IPv6 access network, and (2) Share a public IPv4
   address to multiple users.

   The B4 element resided in the customer premises is provisioned an
   global routable IPv6 address.  It also establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6
   tunnel to AFTR element.  The hosts behind B4 elements are assigned
   with [RFC1918] addresses.  When the B4 receives IPv4 datagram from it
   managed host, it will send the datagram over the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel
   to the AFTR.

   AFTR element provides the NAT function and is responsible for sharing
   public IPv4 addresses to multiple B4 elements.  It also requires
   direct IPv4 connectivity to send and received the NAT-ed datagram to
   the IPv4 network.

   This model puts a demarcation in the network where the access network
   between B4 and AFTR can be IPv6-only and the network north of AFTR
   must be IPv4.  Consider a service provider wants to extend the IPv6-
   only network boundary from the access network to the border of the
   network, this will force the AFTR to be deployed in the border and
   further away from the B4s.  This memo describes a framework to allow
   a service provider to extend the IPv6-only network while to allow the
   AFTR to stay close to the B4s.

1.2.  Requirements

   o  [REQ1] Extend the IPv6-only boundary to the border of the network.

   o  [REQ2] Only the AS Border Router has IPv4 connectivity.

   o  [REQ3] The service provider provisions only IPv6 addresses to the
      customers but continues to provide IPv4 services to them.

   o  [REQ4] The AFTR has only IPv6-connectivity and must be able to
      send and receive IPv4 packets.

1.3.  Overview

   DS-Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] directly connects users
   to IPv6 networks but at the same time provides IPv4 services by
   tunneling IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network.

   AFTR element is the combination of an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel end-point

   and an IPv4-IPv4 NAT implemented in the same node.  In addition, the
   specification assumes that an AFTR is directly connected to the IPv4
   network.

   In some deployments where the service provider wants to deploy AFTR
   in the IPv6 core network.  AFTR nodes may not have direct IPv4
   connectivity.  In this scenario, IPv4 packets after NAT44 function
   applied on an AFTR node need to be transported over the IPv6 core
   network to the IPv4 network.  This memo proposes a framework for this
   scenario as an extension to the DS-Lite specification.

   In this specification, we define a new stateless IPv6-IPv4
   interconnection function (referred to as IPv6-IPv4 ICXF), in a border
   node located at the boundaries between the IPv6 and IPv4 networks.
   The AFTR discovers the ICXF address, and sends IPv4 encapsulated IPv6
   packets after NAT44 function.

   The ICXF may be hosted in an ASBR (Autonomous System Border Router)
   or a dedicated node located at the interconnection between IPv6 and
   IPv4 domains.  A router that hosts the ICXF is referred to as an ICXF
   router.

   When the AFTR receives a customer's outbound packet from B4 element,
   it de-capsulate the packet and perform standard NAT44 function.
   Since an AFTR does not directly connect to the IPv4 network, AFTR
   will encapsulate the NAT-ed IPv4 packet in an IPv4-in-IPv6 packet,
   with an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 destination address
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format], and forward it to an ICXF router
   located with direct connection to the IPv4 network.  When the ICXF
   router receives the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 packet, it will de-capsulate
   the packet and forward the IPv4 packet based on the IPv4 destination
   address.

   For an inbound IPv4 packet to B4 element, the ICXF router will
   encapsulate the IPv4 packet into IPv6 packet with the IPv4-Embedded
   IPv6 address and forward it to the appropriate DS-Lite AFTR node,
   which de-capsulates the IPv4 packet and then follows the normal
   procedure defined by DS-Lite architecture as if the IPv4 packet is
   received from a directly connected IPv4 network.

   Figure 1 provides an overview of the global architecture.  Customers
   are connected to the service domain via a CPE device.  Several DS-
   Lite AFTR nodes are deployed to manage the traffic sent and received
   by the end-user terminal devices.  The service domain is IPv6 only
   and interconnection with adjacent IPv4 realms is implemented using
   IPv6-IPv4 ICXF.  The distributed deployment mode of AFTR nodes is
   motivated by several reasons such as optimizing intra-domain paths,
   avoiding single point of failure, minimizing the impact on geo-

   localization services, minimizing the amount of customers to be
   impacted by an AFTR node failure, etc.  AFTR deployment model varies
   from service provider to service provider and it is out of scope of
   this specification.

   Note in this architecture, the DS-Lite B4 element (located in a CPE)
   and AFTR still behave exactly as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], but with additional functions
   added to the AFTR when it does not directly connect to the IPv4
   network.  A new ICXF function is introduced to perform stateless
   IPv6- IPv4 interconnection.  This specification defines new
   requirements on addressing scheme and routing.  More details are
   provided in the following sections.

2.  Terminology

   This memo defines the following terms:

   o  IPv6-IPv4 Interconnection Function (IPv6-IPv4 ICXF): refers to the
      function that de-capsulates (resp., encapsulates) the IPv6 (resp.,



Boucadair, et al.       Expires January 12, 2011                [Page 6]

      IPv4) packet from DS-Lite AFTR node(s) and forwards the IPv4
      (resp., IPv6) packets to the IPv4 (resp., IPv6) networks.

   o  ICXF router: refers to the border router implemented with IPv6-
      IPv4 ICXF.

   o  DS-Lite AFTR node: refers to the AFTR node whose behavior is
      specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].  In addition,
      this specification assumes that the DS-Lite AFTR node is only
      connected to an IPv6 network.  The AFTR will encapsulate the IPv4
      packet in an IPv6 packet (IPv4-in-IPv6) after the NAT44 function.
      The encapsulated IPv6 packet will be forwarded to the ICXF router.
      This IPv4-inIPv6 encapsulation is stateless.

   o  Access segment: This segment encompasses both the IP access to the
      customers and to the service provider's network.

   o  Interconnection segment: Includes all nodes and resources which
      are deployed at the border of a given AS (Autonomous System) a la
      BGP.

   o  Core segment: Denotes a set of IP networking capabilities and
      resources which are located between the interconnection and the
      access segments.

   o  Pref6: An IPv6 prefix assigned by LIR.  This prefix is configured
      on both ICXF and AFTR.

   o  FROM-AFTR Address: An IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address
      [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] that combines an IPv6 prefix
      Pref6 and the destination IPv4 address.

   o  TO-AFTR Address: An IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address
      [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] that combines an IPv6 prefix
      Pref6 and a destination IPv4 address which configured in an AFTR
      NAT pool.


3.  Addressing

   For outbound IPv4 packets, the AFTR performs encapsulation and the
   ICXF router performs de-capsulation.  For inbound IPv4 packets, the
   ICXF router performs IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation and an AFTR performs
   de-capsulation.

   When an AFTR forwards an IPv6 packet with an IPv4 payload to an ICXF
   router, the source IPv6 address is one of the AFTR's IPv6 address,
   which is normally a global IPv6 address configured on an interface of

   the node (e.g., an address of a loopback interface), and the
   destination IPv6 address is the FROM-AFTR Address.

   When an ICXF router receives an IPv4 packet, it encapsulates the IPv4
   packet with an IPv6 header where the source IPv6 address is the ICXF
   router's global IPv6 address and the destination IPv6 address is the
   TO-AFTR address.  The TO-AFTER address is constructed by combining
   the Pref6 and the destination IPv4 address in the IPv4 packet.  The
   destination IPv4 address is one of the addresses configured in the
   AFTR NAT pool.

   In both cases, the Pref6 is an IPv6 prefix assigned by the service
   provider, and is used to construct an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address.
   Figure 2 gives an example of the address format.


     2a01:c::11000001001100111001000111001110 = 2a01:cc13:391c:e0::/56
    |Pref6 | <--------193.51.145.206-------->


            Figure 2: Example for an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Prefix

   In this example, Pref6 is 2a01:c::/20 and the IPv4_Addr is
   193.51.145.206.  Then, the corresponding IPv6 prefix is: 2a01:cc13:
   391c:e0::/56.  We use a /20 prefix for Pref6.  However, an operator
   can decide to use any prefix length.


4.  DS-Lite AFTR

4.1.  Provisioning

   The AFTR must be provisioned with a set of global IPv4 prefixes for
   NAT44 operations.  In addition, an IPv6 prefix (i.e., Pref6) is
   configured in the AFTR.  The Pref6 is used to construct FROM-AFTR
   addresses.  The FROM-AFTR addresses are used in the destination
   address field of the IPv6 header for the IPv4-in-IPv6 packets.

4.2.  Procedure

   Figure 3 shows the input and output of a DS-Lite AFTR node.

                      Figure 3: Modified DS-Lite AFTR

   Two main (logical) interfaces may be distinguished in a DS-Lite AFTR
   node as follows:

   a.  Interface with the customer device, i.e.- DS-Lite interface per
       [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   b.  Interface with core nodes.  Note that the DS-Lite AFTR does not
       directly connect to an IPv4 domain.

4.2.1.  Processing Ingress Traffic from Customer Interface

   1.  De-capsulate the IPv6 header from the IPv4-in-IPv6 packets (sent
       by the customer device) 2.

   2.  NAT the IPv4 packet and create an entry in the NAT binding table

   3.  Encapsulate the NAT-ed IPv4 packets in IPv6 with a destination
       IPv6 address built according to the addressing scheme described
       in Section 3.  Encapsulated packet is forwarded based on the
       FROM-AFTR IPv6 address by standard routing.  Depending on the
       target IPv4 address, the destination can be an AFTR node inside
       the service provider's domain if the IPv4 address is one of the
       addresses owned by another AFTR (See Figure 4).  Or, the
       destination can be an ICXF router if the IPv4 address is external
       to the service provider.

4.2.2.  Processing Ingress Traffic from Core Interface

   1.  De-capsulate the IPv6 header and extract the IPv4 packet.

   2.  Process the embedded IPv4 packet according to

5.  IPv6-IPv4 Interconnection Function (ICXF)

   ICXF is a border element that encapsulate IPv4 packets from external
   IPv4 network to AFTR and de-capsulate IPv6 packets from AFTR to
   external IPv4 network

   Externally, the ICXF is connected to IPv4 network.  It is an IPv4
   router and performs standard IPv4 routing.  It contains an IPv4
   routing table and exchanges IPv4 prefixes to the internal and
   external peers.

   Internally, the ICXF is connected to an IPv6 network and exchanges
   IPv4 prefixes to the AFTRs.  Section 6 discusses the internal routing
   in details.

5.1.  Provisioning

   An IPv6-IPv4 ICXF router is provisioned with an IPv6 prefix (i.e.,
   Pref6).  Pref6 is used to build TO-AFTR addresses.

5.2.  Procedure

   Figure 6 shows the input and output of an IPv6-IPv4 ICXF.

                 -----------/ |                   |

                 //---IPv4----|                   |/---IPv4----
                 \\-----------|                   |\-----------
                  \-----------|                   |
                              +-------------------+


                 Figure 6: IPv6-IPv4 Interworking Function

   When the ICXF router receives an IPv4 packet from an external IPv4
   domain, it encapsulates the IPv4 packet in IPv6 packet using the
   following information:

   o  Source IPv6 address: One of its own IPv6 addresses.

   o  Destination IPv6 address: TO-AFTR Address which is an IPv4-
      Embedded IPv6 address using the Pref6 and destination IPv4 address

      of the encapsulated IPv4 packet.

   As for the outbound IPv6 packets, an ICXF router performs de-
   capsulation and forwards the embedded IPv4 packets to the connected
   IPv4 networks according to IPv4 routing rule.


6.  Routing Architecture and Considerations

   This section describes the routing consideration to support this
   specification, i.e.- how an IPv6 packet with an IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   destination address is forwarded from a DS-Lite AFTR to an ICXF
   router, and vice versa, in the IPv6 network.

   When a DS-Lite AFTR forwards IPv4-in-IPv6 packets to an ICXF router,
   the destination IPv6 address is an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address, where
   the Pref6 is an IPv6 prefix assigned to the service provider and the
   IPv4 address is reachable through one or more ICXF routers.  The
   forwarding decision can be made based on static configuration or
   dynamic routing.

6.1.  Static Routing

   The AFTR is configured with static routes, and each static route
   points to an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 prefix.  Alternatively, the AFTR can
   contain a default route where the default is the ICXF.

6.2.  Dynamic Routing

   Dynamic routing is more desirable for the deployments where there are
   multiple DS-Lite AFTRs and ICXF routers.  This specification suggests
   four dynamic routing options as documented below:

   Option 1:

   o  AFTRs and ICXF routers are configured as a Softwire Mesh [RFC5565]
      and iBGP is used to exchange IPv4 reachability information.  AFTR
      and ICXF will peer with each other over iBGP and exchange their
      IPv4 reachability.  Each AFTR and ICXF will compute an IPv4
      routing table based upon the BGP table.  Given an IPv4 network
      managed by the AFTR or ICXF, the next-hop of this network is the
      IPv6 address of the AFTR or ICXF.

   o  Pros: This routing option offers an optimized forwarding for IPv4-
      in-IPv6 packets in the IPv6 network.

   o  Cons: DS-Lite AFTRs and ICXF routers must peer in iBGP and storing
      BGP routes on all these nodes.

Internet-Draft              Extended DS-lite                   July 2010


   Option 2:

   o  ICXF router advertises its IPv4 reachability information in IGP.
      This routing option does not require AFTRs and ICXFs to be iBGP
      peers.  For the AFTR IPv6 routing table, it contains all FROM_AFTR
      prefixes and the ICXF IPv4 reachability information in the form on
      IPv4-Embedded IPv6 prefixes (i.e., Pref6 + ICXF IPv4 routing
      information).

   o  Pros: Given that the ICXF advertises all its IPv4 network
      reachability in IPv6 network, the AFTR can choose the best path to
      forward the packet.

   o  Cons: This optimization has a drawback: ICXF routers are required
      to advertise its full IPv4 reachability to in IGP.  As such, IPv6
      routers will maintain the full IPv4 reachability in its IPv6
      routing table.

   Option 3:

   o  With this option, each ICXF router advertises a Pref6
      (Section 5.1) in the IPv6 IGP.  An AFTR forwards an IPv4-in-IPv6
      packet always to a nearest ICXF router.  In other words, the
      nearest ICXF is the default router for all external IPv4 prefixes.

   o  Pros: Significantly reduces the size of the IPv6 routing table to
      virtually one entry for IPv4 reachability.

   o  Cons: The closest ICXF router may not have the best route to the
      final destination in the IPv4 network.  The ICXF may forward the
      packet to another ICXF to reach the IPv4 destination based upon
      the local IPv4 routing information.

   Option 4:

   o  This option requires every router in the IPv6 network to learn the
      IPv4-Embedded IPv6 prefixes advertised by the AFTR and ICXF.
      These prefixes are only meaningful to the AFTR and ICXF, other
      IPv6 routers are not interested in them.  To address this issue, a
      new topology [RFC4915] or [RFC5120] can be created to store the
      IPv4-Embedded IPv6 prefixes.

   o  This option requires the ICXF router and AFTR advertise the IPv4-
      Embedded IPv6 prefixes in the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology.  This
      topology contains only the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 prefixes.  Regular
      IPv6 routers will not participate this topology.

Internet-Draft              Extended DS-lite                   July 2010


   o  With this option, each ICXF router advertises its reachable IPv4
      prefixes in the form of the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses.  These
      LSAs will appear only in the dedicated MT.  AFTR which
      participates the MT will install the LSAs to its IPv6 routing
      table.  Those didn't participates the MT will simply ignore the
      LSAs.

   o  Pros: Only the AFTR and ICXF install the IPv4-Embedded IPv6
      prefixes in the IPv6 routing table.

   o  Cons: Addition administration cost to maintain a new topology in
      ICXF and AFTR.


7.  Multicast Considerations

   This document describes an IPv4-IPv6 inter-connection extension to
   DS-Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], which currently limits
   the scope to transporting unicast IPv4 traffic over IPv6 network
   only.  Considerations on transporting multicast IPv4 traffic over
   IPv6 network is out of scope.


8.  Fragmentation

   Tunneling IPv4 over IPv6 between AFTR and ICXF reduce the effective
   MTU size by the size of an IPv6 header.  Since ICXF tunnel is
   stateless, the tunnel endpoint can't fragment and re-assumable the
   oversized IPv4 packet.  A service provider may increase the MTU size
   by 40-bytes on the IPv6 network.  If this is not possible, AFTR and
   ICXF may use IPv6 Path MTU discovery.

   ICXF nodes are stateless and not necessary to implement IPv4
   fragmentation.


9.  Conclusions

   This document describes the mechanism to enable AFTR to operate on an
   IPv6-only network while offering:

   o  Global IPv6 <==> IPv6 communications.

   o  Global IPv4 <==> IPv4 communications.

   o  A remote IPv6 host would reach a host connected to the DS-Lite
      enabled domain using IPv6.

   o  A remote IPv4 host would reach a host connected to the DS-Lite
      enabled domain using IPv4-in-IPv6.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


11.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] should be taken into account.  In
   addition, current interconnection practices for ingress traffic
   filtering should be enforced in the interconnection points (ICXF).

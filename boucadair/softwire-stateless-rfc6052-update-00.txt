Embedding Port Information in IPv4-Translatable IPv6 Prefixes and IPv4-
                        Embedded IPv6 Addresses
          draft-boucadair-softwire-stateless-rfc6052-update-00

Abstract

   RFC6052 specifies the algorithmic translation of an IPv6 address to a
   corresponding IPv4 address, and vice versa.  In particular, RFC6052
   specifies the address format to build IPv4-converted and IPv4-
   translatable IPv6 addresses.  In order to be deployed in the context
   of stateless 4/6 solutions, RFC6052 should be updated so that IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 addresses convey the port information.  This document
   identifies a set of requirements to be taken into account when
   updating RFC6052 for that purpose.

   A companion effort, document at
   [I-D.bsd-softwire-stateless-port-index-analysis], is required to
   converge on one or a set of algorithms to be used by all stateless
   solutions.

Internet-Draft               RFC6052 Update               September 2011


1.  Introduction

   Several solutions have been proposed in the past to embed the port
   information in an IPv4-embedded IPv6 address or IPv4-translatable
   IPv6 prefix (see [I-D.bsd-softwire-stateless-port-index-analysis]).

   For interoperability purposes, the softwire WG should converge to one
   address format to be used in the context of stateless 4/6 solutions.
   This document specifies such address format based on the conclusions
   of the analysis documented at
   [I-D.bsd-softwire-stateless-port-index-analysis].

   This document focuses exclusively on unicast; multicast-related
   considerations are out of scope.

   For further information about the motivations for stateless
   solutions, the reader is invited to refer to
   [I-D.operators-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation].

1.1.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following term:

   o  IPv4-translatable IPv6 address/prefix: denotes an IPv6 address/
      prefix assigned to an IPv6 node for use with stateless IPv4-IPv6
      translation [RFC6052].

1.2.  Applicability Scope

   The prefix and address format, defined in this document, can be used
   by both encapsulation and translation solutions.

   The usage of this format in an encapsulation or translation mode is
   out of scope of this document.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Why Update RFC6052?

   [RFC6052] specifies the algorithmic translation of an IPv6 address to
   a corresponding IPv4 address, and vice versa.  In particular,
   [RFC6052] specifies the address format to build IPv4-converted and
   IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.  To be deployed in the context of

Internet-Draft               RFC6052 Update               September 2011


   stateless 4/6 solutions, [RFC6052] should be updated so that IPv4-
   translatable IPv6 addresses convey the port information.

   RFC6052 discusses the transport of the port range information in an
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 address but the conclusion was the following
   (excerpt from [RFC6052]):

      "There have been proposals to complement stateless translation
      with a port-range feature.  Instead of mapping an IPv4 address to
      exactly one IPv6 prefix, the options would allow several IPv6
      nodes to share an IPv4 address, with each node managing a
      different range of ports.  If a port range extension is needed, it
      could be defined later, using bits currently reserved as null in
      the suffix."

   This document identifies a set of requirements to be taken into
   account when updating [RFC6052] for that purpose.


3.  Requirements

   In addition to the requirements discussed in [RFC6052], below are
   listed additional requirements to be met when including the port
   information in an IPv4-embedded IPv6 prefix/address:

   REQ#1:  The administrative entity operating the stateless solution
           MUST be able to select the length of the prefix to be used to
           build IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses/prefixes.

   REQ#2:  When extending the IPv6 address with the port, the same
           format MUST be used to build both IPv4-translatable IPv6
           prefixes and IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses.

   REQ#3:  Some service providers may require the ability to
           unambiguously distinguish IPv4 traffic from native IPv6
           traffic (e.g., multi-topology contexts where IPv4 and IPv6
           traffic may be conveyed over different paths).

                   This can be implemented using two distinct prefixes
                   or by having a dedicated flag in the address to
                   identify IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.

Internet-Draft               RFC6052 Update               September 2011


   REQ#4:  When only one single IPv6 prefix is assigned for both native
           IPv6 communications and the transport of IPv4 packets, the
           IPv4-translatable IPv6 prefix MUST have a length < /64.

   REQ#5:  The algorithm that computes how port information is conveyed
           in IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses MUST be standardized for the
           sake of interoperability.

                   Note: Do we allow the support of multiple algorithms?

   REQ#6:  The allocation policy of IPv4-translatable IPv6 prefixes
           embedding the port information MUST preserve proper prefix
           aggregation.

                   In particular, instantiating fragmented entries (due
                   to prefixes embedding the port information) into
                   routing and forwarding tables MUST be avoided.  For
                   more information about the shrink of RIBs, the reader
                   is invited to refer to Section 4.8 of
                   [I-D.narten-radir-problem-statement].



   REQ#7:  Service Providers SHOULD be able to support different classes
           of customers: i.e., be able to assign port ranges of
           different sizes to customers without requiring any per-
           customer state to be instantiated in network elements
           involved in data transfer.

                   IPv4 port usage may not be homogeneous among all
                   customers.  Therefore, differentiated classes may be
                   defined by Service Providers for that purpose.  Each
                   of these classes can be characterized by given size
                   of port sets.

   REQ#8:  Applications requiring even/odd and port contiguity (e.g.,
           RTP/RTCP) SHOULD NOT be broken due to the port set assignment
           scheme.

                   Traditionally the voice/video applications that use
                   RTP and RTCP would specify only the RTP port that the
                   application would use for streaming the RTP data.
                   The inherent assumption is that the RTCP traffic will
                   be sent on the next higher port.  Even though RFC3605
                   defines a new attribute for explicitly specifying the
                   RTCP attribute for the SDP-based applications, but
                   since it is not a MUST to use this attribute, there
                   are still applications that are not compliant with

                   this RFC.  There are also non-SDP based applications
                   that use RTP/RTCP like H323, that make the assumption
                   that RTCP streaming will happen on RTP+1 port.

   Section 4.4 of [I-D.narten-radir-problem-statement] may inspire an
   additional requirement for the stateless IPv4/IPv6 interconnection
   function: loose interaction between the IPv4 address pool and the
   stateless IPv4/IPv6 interconnection function.


4.  Analysis of Port Indexing Algorithms

   The conclusions of [I-D.bsd-softwire-stateless-port-index-analysis]
   will be inserted here.

   Only Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) is allowed to be used to build
   IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses/prefixes.

5.2.  Format

   This format is provided as a reminder.  Appropriate modifications
   will be documented in future version of this document.

   /96 prefixes do not allow to embed the port information.

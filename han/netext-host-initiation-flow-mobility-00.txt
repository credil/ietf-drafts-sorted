Abstract

   Multihomed mobile nodes are capable of simultaneous attachment to
   multiple access networks.  In this case, a PMIPv6-enabled local
   mobility anchor should distribute the application traffic to a proper
   access network which the mobile nodes wish to receive from.  This
   document specifies how mobile nodes send their desire of flow
   movement to an attached mobile access gateway, which then relays it
   to a local mobility anchor.

Internet-Draft       Host Flow Management in PMIPv6        December 2010


1.  Introduction

   The PMIPv6 (Proxy Mobile IPv6) [RFC5213] protocol provides local
   mobility management to a mobile node (MN) without requiring any
   modification of the MN.  If an MN has multiple interfaces and does
   simultaneous attachment to multiple mobile access gateways (MAGs), it
   is expected that a proper interface can be chosen by the local
   mobility anchor (LMA) to deliver the data.  Currently, NETEXT WG
   tries to make a standard of the flow mobility management in PMIPv6.
   By the flow mobility it means that the mobility management function
   classifies the packets at flow level and distributes them to the
   proper interface(s) of an MN, and then applies the same policy to the
   packets that has the same flow information.

   There are two proposals [I-D.draft-bernardos-netext-pmipv6-flowmob],
   [I-D.draft-trung-netext-flow-mobility-support] for supporting the
   flow mobility in PMIPv6.  However, the two proposals allow only
   network-side functionalities (LMA or MAG) to control the flow
   mobility and distribute flows to proper interfaces of MNs.  A problem
   of them is that the MN wishes to receive a flow traffic through a
   particular interface1, but LMA does not know such a MN's wish exactly
   in real-time manner.  By the multiple CoA registration [RFC5648] and
   the flow mobility support [I-D.draft-ietf-mext-flow-binding], the
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] is extended to allow the binding of a
   particular flow to a care-of address without affecting other flows
   using the same home address.  In the host-based flow mobility, an MN
   itself sends the binding identifier and the associated flow
   identifier to the home agent.  Therefore, the home agent becomes to
   know the exact MN's intention about flow distribution and each flow
   of the MN's multiple interfaces can be separately forwarded according
   to the binding identifier and the flow identifier managed in the
   binding cache.

   [I-D.draft-bernardos-netext-pmipv6-flowmob] specifies a protocol
   between the LMA and MAGs to handover one or more service flows from
   an interface to another.  Flow mobility signaling takes place
   whenever the LMA decides to move a flow.  There are two flow mobility
   scenarios: "shared prefix" and "unique prefix".  While no specific
   signaling is required for flow mobility in the shared prefix
   scenario, flow information including required prefix(es) should be
   exchanged between the LMA and MAGs to support flow mobility in the
   unique prefix scenario.
   [I-D.draft-trung-netext-flow-mobility-support] also specifies a flow
   mobility protocol between the LMA and MAGs, and the LMA is also the
   decision functionality for flow movement in the proposal.  It
   proposes two types of signaling: "proactive" and "reactive".  In
   proactive signaling, all the prefixes are shared over all MAGs in
   advanced and thus additional signaling for flow movement is not

   needed.  In reactive signaling, prefix information is delivered from
   LMA to MAG when it should be required to a particular MAG to tunnel a
   new flow moved from an old MAG.

   Although the above proposals specify good network-controlled
   protocols to bind flows to MN's interface, they do not describe how
   to receive the MN's intention about flow distribution.  Actually, a
   pure network-controlled protocol excluding the MN's involvement
   cannot support such a function.  However, host-controlled MIPv6 does
   well support it and the home agent can distribute service flows
   according to MN's intention in a real-time manner.

   This document specifies how MNs send their intention about flow
   distribution to the attached MAG, which then relays it to the LMA.
   The proposed scheme does not violate the PMIPv6's inherent policy.
   That is, basic flow mobility management follows the network-
   controlled flow management protocol which will be made as IETF
   standard, so that creation and management of flow binding are
   performed in network-side functionalities (LMA or MAG).  There are no
   messages newly defined in this document.  MN just notifies its
   intention to MAG by exchanging the existing router solicitation and
   advertisement messages with MAG.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5213], [RFC5648], and [I-D.draft-ietf-mext-flow-binding].


3.  Protocol Operation

   In PMIPv6, an MN is not directly involved with mobility management
   and the binding information is created and managed by an MAG and the
   LMA.  Therefore, an MN cannot be also involved with flow binding
   management.  The LMA or the MAG will perform the operations based on
   the future IETF standard for network-based flow mobility.

   When a flow binding is initially created in network-side, the LMA (or
   MAGs) determines which interface of the MN is "best-mapped" to the
   current service flow based usually on the MN policy, which is stored
   in somewhere in operator network.  After the flow binding information
   is exchanged by the MAG and the LMA by using a protocol defined by
   the future IETF standard, the MAG sends a router advertisement

   message to the MN in unicast manner (in PMIPv6, router advertisement
   message should be sent in unicast manner).  This router advertisement
   message carries the created flow identifier and the corresponding
   flow information tuple (for example, including the IPv6 HNP/IPv4 HoA,
   transport protocol port numbers and QoS parameters for uplink and
   downlink).  When the MN receives such a router advertisement message,
   it stores the flow binding information internally.

   Sometimes, an MN wishes to move a service flow from the current
   interface to other interface.  This flow handover can be caused by
   the MN-internal or user's decision.  At this time, the MN sends the
   router solicitation message to the MAG via the new interface from
   which the MN wishes to receive the flow traffic.  In PMIPv6, the MAG
   acts as the default router on the point-to-point link shared with the
   MN.  So, the router solicitation message will be directly sent to the
   MAG.  This router solicitation message carries the flow identifier of
   the flow which the MN intends to move from the current interface to
   the new interface.

   When receiving such a router solicitation including service flow
   information, MAG does perform the network-controlled flow handover
   operations based on the future IETF standard for flow mobility.  If
   the future IETF standard does not have a protocol where MAG initiates
   the flow mobility, it is needed that MAG forwards the MN's flow
   mobility intention to the LMA.  It is noted that the MN's intention
   should be analyzed at the LMA and the LMA can allow or disallow the
   flow mobility.

   The following Figure 1 depicts the proposed procedure.

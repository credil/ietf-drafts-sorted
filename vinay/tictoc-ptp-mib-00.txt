1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet Community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing PTP
   devices including the ordinary clock, transparent clock, boundary
   clocks. It is envisioned this MIB will complement other managed
   objects defined to monitor, measure the performance of the PTP
   devices and telecom clocks. Those objects are considered out of
   scope for the current draft.

1.1. Change Log

   This section tracks changes made to the revisions of the Internet
   Drafts of this document.  It will be *deleted* when the document is
   published as an RFC.   This section tracks changes made to the

2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in [RFC 2271].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
      [RFC 1155], [RFC 1212] and [RFC 1215].
      The second version, called SMIv2, is described in [RFC 2578],
      [RFC 2579] and [RFC 2580]

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in [RFC 1157].  A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
      called SNMPv2c and described in [RFC 1901] and [RFC 1905].  The
      third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
      described in [RFC 1906], [RFC 2572] and [RFC 2574].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in [RFC 1157].  A second set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in [RFC 1905].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in [RFC 2573] and the
      view-based access control mechanism described in [RFC 2575].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this

   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

3. Overview

   The objects defined in this MIB are to be used when describing
   Precision Time Protocol (PTPv2).

       DESCRIPTION
           "The MIB module for PTPv2 (IEEE (TM) 1588 - 2008)

           Overview of PTPv2 (IEEE (TM) 1588-2008)

           [IEEE1588-2008] defines a protocol enabling precise
           synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems
           implemented with packet-based networks, the Precision Time
           protocol version 2 (PTPv2). This MIB does not address the
           standard IEEE(TM) 1588 (2002) and PTPv1. The protocol is
           applicable to network element communicating using IP. The
           protocol enables heterogeneous systems that include clocks
           of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability to

           synchronize to a grandmaster clock.

           The protocol supports system-wide synchronization accuracy
           in the sub-microsecond range with minimal network and local
           clock computing resources. [IEEE1588-2008] uses UDP/IP or
           Ethernet and can be adapted to other mapping. It includes
           formal mechanisms for message extensions, higher sampling
           rates, correction for asymmetry, a clock type to reduce
           error accumulation in large topologies, and specifications
           on how to incorporate the resulting additional data into the
           synchronization protocol. The [IEEE1588-2008] defines
           conformance and management capability also.

           MIB description

           This MIB is to support the Precision Time Protocol version 2
           (PTPv2, hereafter designated as PTP) features of network
           Element System devices.

           As defined in [IEEE1588-2008]:

           Accuracy:
           The mean of the time or frequency error between the clock
           under test and a perfect reference clock, over an ensemble
           of measurements.  Stability is a measure of how the mean
           varies with respect to variables such as time, temperature,
           and so on.

           The precision is a measure of the deviation of the error
           From the mean.

           Atomic process:
           A process is atomic if the values of all inputs to the
           Process are not permitted to change until all of the results
           of the process are instantiated, and the outputs of the
           process are not visible to other processes until the
           processing of each output is complete.

           Boundary clock:
           A clock that has multiple Precision Time Protocol(PTP) ports
           in a domain and maintains the timescale used in the domain.
           It may serve as the source of time, i.e., be a master clock,

           and may synchronize to another clock, i.e., be a slave
           clock.

           Clock:
           A node participating in the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
           that is capable of providing a measurement of the passage of
           time since a defined epoch.

           Domain:
           A logical grouping of clocks that synchronize to each other
           using the protocol, but that are not necessarily
           synchronized to clocks in another domain.

           End-to-end transparent clock:
           A transparent clock that supports the use of the end-to-end
           delay measurement mechanism between slave clocks and the
           master clock.  Each node must measure the residence time of
           PTP event messages and accumulate it in Correction Field.

           Epoch:
           The origin of a timescale.

           Event:
           An abstraction of the mechanism by which signals or
           conditions are generated and represented.

           Foreign master:
           An ordinary or boundary clock sending Announce messages to
           another clock that is not the current master recognized by
           the other clock.

           Grandmaster clock:
           Within a domain, a clock that is the ultimate source of time
           for clock synchronization using the protocol.

           Holdover:
           A clock previously synchronized/syntonized to another clock
           (normally a primary reference or a master clock) but now
           free-running based on its own internal oscillator, whose
           frequency is being adjusted using data acquired while it had
           been synchronized/syntonized to the other clock.  It is said
           to be in holdover or in the holdover mode, as long as it is
           within its accuracy requirements.

           Link:
           A network segment between two Precision Time Protocol ports
           supporting the peer delay mechanism of this standard.  The
           peer delay mechanism is designed to measure the propagation
           time over such a link.

           Management node:
           A device that configures and monitors clocks.

           Master clock:
           In the context of a single Precision Time Protocol
           communication path, a clock that is the source of time to
           which all other clocks on that path synchronize.

           Message timestamp point:
           A point within a Precision Time Protocol event message
           serving as a reference point in the message.  A timestamp is
           defined by the instant a message timestamp point passes the
           reference plane of a clock.

           Multicast communication:
           A communication model in which each Precision Time Protocol
           message sent from any PTP port is capable of being received
           and processed by all PTP ports on the same PTP communication
           path.

           Node:
           A device that can issue or receive Precision Time Protocol
           communications on a network.

           One-step clock:
           A clock that provides time information using a single event
           message.

           On-pass support:
           Indicates that each node in the synchronization chain from
           master to slave can support IEEE-1588.

           Ordinary clock:
           A clock that has a single Precision Time Protocol port in a
           domain and maintains the timescale used in the domain.  It
           may serve as a source of time, i.e., be a master clock, or
           may synchronize to another clock, i.e., be a slave clock.

           Parent clock:
           The master clock to which a clock is synchronized.

           Peer-to-peer transparent clock:
           A transparent clock that, in addition to providing Precision
           Time Protocol event transit time information, also provides
           corrections for the propagation delay of the link connected
           to the port receiving the PTP event message.  In the
           presence of peer-to-peer transparent clocks, delay
           measurements between slave clocks and the master clock are

           performed using the peer-to-peer delay measurement
           mechanism.

           Phase change rate:
           The observed rate of change in the measured time with
           respect to the reference time.  The phase change rate is
           equal to the fractional frequency offset between the
           measured frequency and the reference frequency.

           PortNumber:
           An index identifying a specific Precision Time Protocol port
           on a PTP node.

           Primary reference:
           A source of time and or frequency that is traceable to
           international standards.

           Profile:
           The set of allowed Precision Time Protocol features
           applicable to a device.

           Precision Time Protocol communication:
           Information used in the operation of the protocol,
           transmitted in a PTP message over a PTP communication path.

           Precision Time Protocol communication path:
           The signaling path portion of a particular network enabling
           direct communication among ordinary and boundary clocks.

           Precision Time Protocol node:
           PTP ordinary, boundary, or transparent clock or a device
           that generates or parses PTP messages.

           Precision Time Protocol port:
           A logical access point of a clock for PTP communications to
           the communications network.

           Recognized standard time source:
           A recognized standard time source is a source external to
           Precision Time Protocol that provides time and/or frequency
           as appropriate that is traceable to the international
           standards laboratories maintaining clocks that form the
           basis for the International Atomic Time and Universal
           Coordinated Time timescales.  Examples of these are Global
           Positioning System, NTP, and National Institute of Standards
           and Technology (NIST) timeservers.

           Requestor:
           The port implementing the peer-to-peer delay mechanism that

           initiates the mechanism by sending a Pdelay_Req message.

           Responder:
           The port responding to the receipt of a Pdelay_Req message
           as part of the operation of the peer-to-peer delay
           mechanism.

           Synchronized clocks:
           Two clocks are synchronized to a specified uncertainty if
           they have the same epoch and their measurements of the time
           of a single event at an arbitrary time differ by no more
           than that uncertainty.

           Syntonized clocks:
           Two clocks are syntonized if the duration of the second is
           the same on both, which means the time as measured by each
           advances at the same rate. They may or may not share the
           same epoch.

           Timeout:
           A mechanism for terminating requested activity that, at
           least from the requester's perspective, does not complete
           within the specified time.

           Timescale:
           A linear measure of time from an epoch.

           Traceability:
           A property of the result of a measurement or the value of a
           standard whereby it can be related to stated references,
           usually national or international standards, through an
           unbroken chain of comparisons all having stated
           uncertainties.

           Translation device:
           A boundary clock or, in some cases, a transparent clock that
           translates the protocol messages between regions
           implementing different transport and messaging protocols,
           between different versions of IEEE Std 1588-2008/IEC
           61588:2009, or different Precision Time Protocol profiles.

           Transparent clock:
           A device that measures the time taken for a Precision Time
           Protocol event message to transit the device and provides
           this information to clocks receiving this PTP event message.

           Two-step clock:
           A clock that provides time information using the combination
           of an event message and a subsequent general message.

                                   initial state a slave starts out

                                   time. The slave can continue to
                                   operate in this state for some time.
                                   If communication with the master is

           Freerun state. Applies to a slave device that is not locked

           with when
           it is not getting any PTP packets from the master or because
           of some other input error (erroneous packets, etc).

           Holdover state. In this state the slave device is locked to
           a master but communication with the master is lost or the
           timestamps in the ptp packets are incorrect. But since the
           slave was locked to the master, it can run with the same
           accuracy for sometime. The slave can continue to operate in
           this state for some time. If communication with the master
           is not restored for a while, the device is moved to the
           FREERUN state.

           Acquiring state. The slave device is receiving packets from
           a master and is trying to acquire a lock.

           Freq_locked state. The slave device is locked to the master
           with respect to frequency, but is not phase aligned.

5. Relationship to the Interface MIB

   This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the
   Interfaces MIB [RFC 2233]. Several areas of correlation are
   addressed in the following subsections.  The implementor is referred
   to the Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general
   intent of these areas.

6. MIB modules required for IMPORTS

       MODULE-IDENTITY,
       OBJECT-TYPE,
       Integer32,
       Gauge32,
       Unsigned32,
       Counter32,
       Counter64
           FROM SNMPv2-SMI
       OBJECT-GROUP,
       MODULE-COMPLIANCE
           FROM SNMPv2-CONF
       TEXTUAL-CONVENTION,
       TruthValue,
       DisplayString
           FROM SNMPv2-TC
       InetAddressType,
       InetAddress
           FROM INET-ADDRESS-MIB
       InterfaceIndexOrZero
           FROM IETF-TC


7. Security Considerations

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to PTP objects. While unauthorized access to the readable
   objects is relatively innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-
   able objects could cause a denial of service, or could cause
   unauthorized creation and/or manipulation of tunnels. Hence, the
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [RFC 2574] and the View-based
   Access Control Model [RFC 2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to access them.

Abstract

   Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of networks in which
   both the routers and their interconnects are constrained.  LLN
   routers typically operate with constraints on processing power,
   memory, and energy (battery power).  LLN router supported traffic
   flows include point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-
   point. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provides the
   mechanisms to support those traffic flows.  The currently available
   security services in RPL will not protect against a compromised
   internal node that can also construct and disseminate fake messages. 
   In this document, a service is described that prevents an internal
   attacker from impersonating a Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic
   Graph (DODAG) root.  Moreover, the establishment and maintenance of
   any cryptographic key is out of the scope of the current RPL
   proposal.  In this document a service that allows nodes to agree on
   local keys with their neighborhood is also presented.

1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   This document adopts and conforms to the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology] and in [RFC4949].

   In this document, 'compromised' refers to taking control over a node.
   'Potential DODAG roots' are grounded DODAG roots and a small set of
   capable nodes that could become floating DODAG roots. 'Data
   authenticity' is the assurance about the source of transmitted
   information (and, hereby, that information was not modified in
   transit).

   As they form networks, LLN devices often mix the roles of 'host' and
   'router' when compared to traditional IP networks.  In this document,
   'host' refers to an LLN device that can generate but does not forward
   RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] traffic, 'router' refers to an LLN device
   that can forward as well as generate RPL traffic, and 'node' refers
   to any RPL device, either a host or a router.


2  Introduction

   Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) consist largely of constrained
   nodes with limited processing power, memory, and sometimes energy,
   when they are battery operated.  These routers are interconnected by
   unstable lossy links, typically supporting only low packet and data
   delivery rates.  Another characteristic of such networks is that
   point-to-point is not the typical traffic pattern, but point-to-
   multipoint or multipoint-to-point are.  Furthermore, such networks
   may potentially comprise up to thousands of nodes.

   These characteristics offer unique challenges to a routing solution.
   The IETF ROLL Working Group has defined application-specific routing
   requirements for a Low power and Lossy Network (LLN) routing
   protocol, specified in [RFC5867], [RFC5826], [RFC5673], and
   [RFC5548].  Moreover, based on those standards, an IPv6 Routing
   Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) has been proposed
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] and a security framework for RPL is described in
   [I-D-roll-security-framework].

   Many LLN systems are deployed in unattended or remote locations, such
   as urban environments [RFC5548].  Hence, security mechanisms that
   provide confidentiality and authentication are critical for the
   operation of many applications.  The currently available security
   services in RPL proposed in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl]  will not protect

   against a compromised internal node that can also construct and
   disseminate fake messages.  Moreover, the establishment and
   maintenance of any cryptographic key is out of the scope of the
   current RPL proposal [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  Therefore, this document
   presents two new security services for RPL:

      o  DIO Message Broadcast Authentication - secures the network from
         misbehaving nodes to become a DODAG root and to increase the
         Version Number.

      o  Local Key Agreement - allows each node to agree on local keys
         with its neighborhood.

   The implementation of the security services described in this
   document are OPTIONAL.  A given implementation MAY support a subset
   (including the empty set) of the described security services; for
   example, the implementation could support Local Key Agreement, but
   not DIO Message Authentication.  An implementer SHOULD clearly
   specify which security services are supported, and it is RECOMMENDED
   that implementers carefully consider security requirements and the
   availability of security mechanisms in their network.

3  Security Services

   This section describes two protocols; the first enables nodes to
   authenticate DIO Messages.  The second protocol enables nodes to a)
   agree on a pairwise key, with each of its neighbors; and b) generate
   and disseminate a cluster key, a shared key between a node and all of
   its neighbors.  The hash functions, MAC functions, and the digital
   signatures used in the protocols are based on sections 10.1 and
   10.9.2 of [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], e. g., SHA-256 hash function specified
   in Section 6.2 of [FIPS180], message encoding rules of Section 8.1 of
   [RFC3447]. The elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) used in section 3.1
   is based on section 2.7 of [SECG2].  The Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM)
   used in section 3.2, is described in [RFC3610].  Note that although
   [RFC3610] disallows the CCM mode with M=0, RPL explicitly allows the
   CCM mode with M=0 when used in conjunction with a signature, because
   the signature provides sufficient data authentication.  Here, the CCM
   mode with M=0 is specified as in [RFC3610], but where the M field in
   Section 2.2 of [RFC3610] MUST be set to 0.  The Hashed Message
   Authentication Mode (HMAC) in the protocols is described in
   [RFC4868].

3.1  DIO Message Authentication

   A grounded DODAG offers connectivity to hosts that are required to
   satisfy the application-defined goal.  An attacker may try to become
   a DODAG root by sending a well-constructed DIO message where the
 


Dvir, et al.                 June 25, 2011                      [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT       Extension of Security Services     January 14, 2011


   grounded flag is set.  The scope of the current RPL security services
   is the link; therefore, the authenticity of the messages sent by the
   DODAG root relies on the trustworthiness of all intermediate nodes
   and the fact that none of the keys are compromised.  Any key that is
   compromised allows an attacker to send an authentic DIO message that
   will be accepted by all the nodes.  Therefore, a node that received
   the DIO message from the attacker will multicast to its neighbors the
   DIO message using uncompromised keys.  The content of the message
   from the attacker will affect other nodes participating in the DODAG.
   

   RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] allows the Version Number to be increased
   regularly or occasionally.  Moreover, the whole network can be
   reconstructed by sending a DIO message with an increased Version
   Number. Therefore, preventing any misbehaving node from impersonating
   the actual DODAG root by increasing the Version Number is essential. 
   In particular, only those parts of the DIO message that do not need
   to be updated when the nodes forward the DIO message can be
   protected.  The static fields are the following:  

      o  DIO Base Object:

         o  RPLInstanceID

         o  G|A|T|MOP|Prf

         o  DODAGID

         o  Version

      o  Routing Information (option)

      o  DODAG Configuration (option)

   By authenticating the DIO message,  each node can securely forward
   the DIO message in order to bootstrap or update the DODAG.  

   The Authentication procedure starts/updates from a DODAG root toward
   the nodes as follows:

      1.  The DODAG root first generates a random number r.

      2.  The DODAG root calculates h(h...(h(h(r)))), also denoted by
         h^n(r), where h() is a hash function and n is the length of the
         chain.  This value is called the hash chain root [L1981].

      3.  The DODAG root authenticates the h^n(r) value as well as the
         static fields using any supported integrity protection

         algorithm (e. g., digital signature or a MAC function).

      4.  The DODAG root sends a DIO message with the authenticated
         value.

      5.  Each node receiving a DIO message verifies the authenticity of
         the static fields of the message.

      6.  If the message is authentic, the node saves the Version Number
         value (init or update value), the hash chain value (root or
         current chain value), and the integrity protection data (MAC
         value or signature) for future use, and multicast to all
         neighbors the DIO message after updating the fields as
         described in section 6.3.1. of [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

      7.  If the message is not authentic, the receiver MUST ignore the
         message.

   In case the implementer decides to authenticate the hash chain root
   with an integrity protection mechanism, steps 1-7 MUST be
   implemented. If not, only steps 1-2 MUST be implemented.  When
   digital signature is used, each node has to know the public 
   signature verification key.  When symmetric keys are used, all nodes
   must have a preshared key K.  In order to minimize the computation
   time and memory usage of the hash chain, the implementer can use the
   technique in [OptHash] on the DODAG root side. 

   When the DODAG root increases the Version Number (by k from the
   initial Version Number value), the DODAG root reveals the value of
   h^(n-k)(r) and inserts this value in the DIO message with Broadcast
   Authentication Option.  When node v receives the DIO message it can
   easily verify the message because, if the Version Number is increased
   by the DODAG root, h^k(h^(n-k)(r)) must be equal to h^n(r). For an
   attacker, computing the previous element h^(i-1)(r) knowing h^i(r) is
   hard when r is not known and h() is a cryptographic one-way function.

   In order to authenticate the static fields of a DIO message and the
   Version Number, a DIO MUST carry one or more "Broadcast
   Authentication" options.  A Broadcast Authentication option consists
   of the following fields:

   Security Algorithm: The Security Algorithm field specifies the
         encryption, MAC, and signature scheme used by the network.  The
         high order bit (0x80) of the code denotes whether Integrity
         Protection has been enabled.  The second high order bit (0xC0)
         of the code denotes whether the Integrity Protection is using
         symmetric or asymmetric key algorithms.  Supported values of
         this field are as follows:

3.1.1  Sequence Diagram

   The sequence diagram of the DIO Message Authentication has three
   parts: authentication procedure, Version Number update, and,
   admission of a new node in the DODAG.

         The length of the integrity protection value (3096 bits in this
         example) can be larger than the maximum length of the
         Authentication data.  

         Each DODAG node saves the IP value, Root value, and the initial
         Version Number (taken from the DIO message).  Each DODAG node
         sends the DIO message to its neighbors. 

   In the case when a root wants to update the Version Number, the DIO
   messages (messages #3 and #4) consist of the following Broadcast
   Authentication Option(the format of the option is described in Figure
   1):

      o  One of the node's value of the hash chain, CH value: 

             +--+---+-+--+-+----------+
             |10| 34|0|2 |0|    0x01  |

             |Current Hash Chain Value|
             +------------------------+


         Each DODAG node verifies the values as explained above and
         saves the current hash value and the current Version Number
         (taken from the DIO message).

   In the case when a new node (newcomer) wants to join the DODAG, a
   node receiving a unicast DIS message (message #5) from the new node
   (newcomer) must reply with a DIO message (message #6), consisting of
   the following Broadcast Authentication Options(the format of the
   option is described in Figure 1):

      o  The root chain value (HR value, as sent in message #1 and #2):

             +--+---+-+--+-+-------+

3.2  Local Key Agreement

   Providing security is particularly challenging to LLN networks due to
   the resource limitations. If a group key is used for peer-to-peer
   communication, protection is provided only against outsider devices
   and not against potential malicious devices in the key-sharing group.
   However, local key agreements can be used despite the node limitation
   in order to authenticate MAC layer one-hop unicast and multicast for
   all neighbors' messages. The establishment and maintenance of any
   cryptographic key for security services is out of the scope of the
   current RPL proposal.  This section describes two protocols, 
   establishment of a pairwise key and establishment of a cluster key. 
   Both protocols assume the following:

      o  T is defined as the lower bound on the time for an adversary to
         compromise a node. T is measured from the boot/restart time of
         the node.

      o  T is greater than the accumulated time required to construct a
         DODAG and the time to create local key agreements. 

      o  Each node has preshared key K at boot/restart.

3.2.1  Pairwise Shared Key

   This section describes a pairwise shared key agreement protocol based
   on the Localized Encryption and Authentication Protocol (LEAP)
   [LEAP].  This section does not provide results on LEAP's performance
   or behavior, nor does it explain the algorithm's design in detail.
   Interested readers should refer to [LEAP]. 

   The pairwise key agreement consists of the following steps:

      o  Each node sets the safe period timer; the pairwise key
         agreement protocol assumes that the nodes are not compromised
         before this timer expires.

      o  Each u node derives its own key Ku=MAC(K,u), K is a preshared
         master key, and u is the IPv6 address of the node.

      o  Each Node u multicasts its identifier to all neighbors.

      o  Each node v receiving the identifier from u, responds with
         message (v, MAC(Kv, u|v)).

INTERNET DRAFT       Extension of Security Services     January 14, 2011


      o  The pairwise key Kuv is generated as: Kuv=MAC(Kv,u).

      o  After the safe period timer expires, each node deletes the
         preshared key K (from its memory).

      o  Each node has a set of pairwise keys, one for each neighbor.

      o  In case of conflict, a node chooses the pairwise key generated
         by the node with the lower id.

   Figure 5 presents the messages exchanged between two neighbors in the
   pairwise key agreement:

   The pairwise key establishment can be based on RPL messages, by
   piggy-backing the key agreement message on RPL messages. Implementers
   may choose to use the LEAP option on any of the one-hop bi-
   directional message exchanges done in RPL based on the design
   considerations of their implementation. Below are lists of design
   considerations, possible message exchange schemes, and a matrix
   summarizing which design considerations are covered by each message
   exchange scheme.

3.2.1.1  Message Design Considerations List

   The design considerations are as follows:

      o  RPLM:  The scheme should not introduce a new RPL message type. 

      o  RPLF:  The scheme should not change RPL functionality.

      o  EFFI:  The scheme should be efficient (low communication and
         computation overhead).

      o  STP:  The local key agreement must be completed before the safe
         time period expires.

      o  BN:  The scheme must work when the network boots and when a new
         node joins the DODAG.

      o  NEI:  The scheme must find all of a node's neighbors.

      o  MAND:  The scheme should prefer mandatory RPL message types (i.
         e., DIO, DIS).

      o  RELY:  The scheme should not rely on DODAG or DODAGID.

3.2.1.2  Message Exchange Schemes

   The possible message exchange schemes that can be used to implement
         the key agreement protocol are as follows:

      o  S1:  u -> * DAO Multicast
              v -> u DAO Unicast Ack

INTERNET DRAFT       Extension of Security Services     January 14, 2011


      o  S2:  u -> * DAO Multicast
              v -> u DAO Multicast Ack

      o  S3:  u -> * DAO Multicast
              v -> u DAO Multicast

      o  S4:  u -> * DIO Multicast
              v -> u DIO Unicast

      o  S5:  u -> * DIS Multicast
              v -> u DIO Unicast

      o  S6:  u -> * DIS Multicast or DIO Multicast
              v -> u DIO Multicast

      o  S7:  u -> * New RPL Base Message 
              v -> u New RPL Base Message

   In case the response message is a Multicast, the sender may add a
   number of IPv6 addresses. In order to save overhead, any algorithm to
   compress the addresses can be used, e. g., a collision resistance
   hash function, the method used in Prefix Information Option.
   Selecting at least one is mandatory in order to use the LEAP option.

   #0 -   Acknowledgement of DAO Multicast required, while the RPL
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] states that Ack is sent to unicast messages.

   #1 -   The number of extra Ack messages is proportional to the number
   of neighbors. Those messages may potentially cause congestion and
   collisions.

   #2 -   DAO-Multi-Ack is a new type.

   #3 -   According to the RPL specification [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], DAO
   Multicast is not sent automatically as a response to DAO Multicast.

   #4 -  The number of extra DAO Multicast messages is proportional to
   the number of neighbors. This number can be reduced with longer
   aggregated messages.

INTERNET DRAFT       Extension of Security Services     January 14, 2011


   #5 -  According to the RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], DIO Unicast is not
   sent automatically to DIO Multicast. 

   #6 -  The number of extra DIO messages has an order of magnitude of
   the number of neighbors. Compared to other base messages, the length
   of a DIO message is longer.

   #7 -  According to the RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], the response message
   to DIS Multicast is DIO Multicast and not DIO Unicast.

   #8 -  Part of the DODAG construction.

   #9 -  The number of the extra new RPL messages is proportional to the
   number of neighbors.

   For example, if S6 (using DIS Multicast and DIO Multicast) is
   selected for implementation, the following apply:

      1.  Each node periodically sends a DIS message before joining the
         DODAG (as described in section 17.2.1.1. of
         [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl]).

      2.  A non-DODAG node, a node that is not part of the DODAG, when
         receiving a DIS message, MUST ignore the message.

      3.  A non-DODAG node, when receiving a DIO message, follows the
         RPL.

      4.  A DODAG node, when receiving a DIS or DIO message during the
         Trickle interval, checks whether a pairwise key exists with the
         sender.

            4a.  If not, the node adds a new LEAP option with the
            compressed address to its next DIO message, and copies the
            pairwise key it generates.  The node also initializes a
            retransmission value, a maximum number each node will try to
            retransmit to a neighbor (can be different for different
            neighbors).

            4b.  If a pairwise key exists, the node checks the
            retransmission value.

               I.  If the retransmission value is greater than zero, the
               node adds a LEAP option to its next DIO message.

               II.  Otherwise, it does not add a LEAP option.

               III.  It always decreases the retransmission value.

3.2.2  Cluster Key

   This section describes a cluster key agreement procedure based on the
   LEAP algorithm [LEAP].  This section does not provide results on
   LEAP's performance or behavior, nor does it explain the algorithm's
   design in detail.  Interested readers should refer to [LEAP].

   The cluster key establishment phase follows the pairwise key
   establishment phase. The cluster key agreement has the following
   steps:

      o  Node u first generates a random key.

      o  For each neighbor, node u encrypts this random key with the
         neighbor's pairwise key.

      o  For each neighbor, node u sends the encrypted random key.

   The cluster key agreement can be realized with RPL messages;  any RPL
   Unicast message is OPTIONAL.  For example, a node sends a DAO unicast
   message with a Cluster Key Option that can carry the cluster key
   encrypted to each neighbor.

   In order to generate a cluster key, an RPL message MUST carry a
   "Cluster Key" option.  A Cluster Key option consists of the following
   fields:

        0                   1                   2                   3

4  Security Considerations

   The security mechanisms in this standard extend the RPL security
   mechanisms, sections 6.1 and 10 of [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  Therefore,
   the security consideration described in section 18 of
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] exists in this document.  The scope of the
   current RPL security services is the link; the authenticity of the
   messages sent by the DODAG root relies on the trustworthiness of all
   intermediate nodes and the fact that none of the keys are
   compromised.  The herein proposed DIO Message Authentication extends
   the data integrity and data origin authentication [RFC3552] into
   network level, by authenticating the static fields of the DIO message
   for all nodes in the DODAG.  

   The security mechanisms in RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] are based on
   symmetric-key and public-key cryptography, and use keys that are to
   be provided by higher/lower layer processes.  However, the
   establishment and maintenance of these keys are out of the scope of
   the current RPL.  The proposed local key agreement gives new
   procedures in order to establish and maintain pairwise and cluster
   keys for peer entity authentication [RFC3552].  The cryptographic
   protection using pairwise and cluster keys allows some flexibility
   and application specific tradeoffs between key storage and key
   maintenance costs versus the cryptographic protection provided.  

   The security services in this document are based on symmetric-key and
   public-key cryptography and assume a safe time interval after
   bootstrapping, during which an attacker cannot compromise a node.

INTERNET DRAFT       Extension of Security Services     January 14, 2011


   The current RPL security services [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] assume that a
   node wishing to join a secured network has been preconfigured with a
   shared key; for example, each node MAY use a secure message with
   KIM=0.  Moreover, to join a secure RPL network, a node either listens
   for secure DIO messages or triggers secure DIOs by sending a secure
   DIS.

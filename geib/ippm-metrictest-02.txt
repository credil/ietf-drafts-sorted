Abstract

   This document specifies tests to determine if multiple independent
   instantiations of a performance metric RFC have implemented the
   specifications in the same way.  This is the performance metric
   equivalent of interoperability, required to advance RFCs along the
   standards track.  Results from different implementations of metric
   RFCs will be collected under the same underlying network conditions
   and compared using state of the art statistical methods.  The goal is
   an evaluation of the metric RFC itself, whether its definitions are
   clear and unambiguous to implementors and therefore a candidate for
   advancement on the IETF standards track.

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Standards Process RFC2026 [RFC2026] requires that for a
   IETF specification to advance beyond the Proposed Standard level, at
   least two genetically unrelated implementations must be shown to
   interoperate correctly with all features and options.  There are two
   distinct reasons for this requirement.

   In the case of a protocol specification, the notion of
   "interoperability" is reasonably intuitive - the implementations must
   successfully "talk to each other", while exercising all features and
   options.  To achieve interoperability, two implementors need to
   interpret the protocol specifications in equivalent ways.  In the
   case of IP Performance Metrics (IPPM), this definition of
   interoperability is only useful for test and control protocols like
   OWAMP [RFC4656] and TWAMP [RFC5357].

   A metric specification RFC describes one or more metric definitions,
   methods of measurement and a way to report the results of
   measurement.  One example would be a way to test and report the One-
   way Delay that data packets incur while being sent from one network
   location to another, One-way Delay Metric.

   In the case of metric specifications, exactly what constitutes
   "interoperation" is less obvious.  The IETF has not yet agreed on how
   to judge metric specification "interoperability" in the context of
   the IETF Standards Process.  This draft provides methods which should
   be suitable to evaluate metric specifications for standards track
   advancement.  The methods proposed here MAY be generally applicable
   to metric specification RFCs beyond those developed under the IPPM
   Framework [RFC2330].

   Since many implementations of IP metrics are embedded in measurement
   systems that do not interact with one another (they were built before
   OWAMP and TWAMP), the interoperability evaluation called for in the
   IETF standards process cannot be determined by observing that
   independent implementations interact properly for various protocol
   exchanges.  Instead, verifying that different implementations give
   statistically equivalent results under controlled measurement
   conditions takes the place of interoperability observations.  Even
   when evaluating OWAMP and TWAMP RFCs for standards track advancement,
   the methods described here are useful to evaluate the measurement
   results because they have little value otherwise.

   The standards advancement process aims at producing confidence that
   the metric definitions and supporting material are clearly worded and
   unambiguous, or reveals ways in which the metric definitions can be
   revised to achieve clarity.  The process also permits identification



Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010                [Page 3]

   of options that were not implemented, so that they can be removed
   from the advancing specification.  Thus, the product of this process
   is information about the metric specification RFC itself:
   determination of the specifications or definitions that are clear and
   unambiguous and those that are not (as opposed to an evaluation of
   the implementations which assist in the process).

   This document defines a process to verify that implementations (or
   practically, measurement systems) have interpreted the metric
   specifications in equivalent ways, and produce equivalent results.

   Testing for statistical equivalence requires ensuring identical test
   setups (or awareness of differences) to the best possible extent.
   Thus, producing identical test conditions is a core requirement.
   Another important aspect of this process is to test individual
   implementations against specific requirements in the metric
   specifications using customized tests for each requirement.  These
   tests can distinguish equivalent interpretations of each specific
   requirement.

   Conclusions on equivalence are reached by two measures.

   First, implementations are compared against individual metric
   specifications to make sure that differences in implementation are
   minimised or at least known.

   Second, a test setup is proposed ensuring identical networking
   conditions so that unknowns are minimized and comparisons are
   simplified.  The resulting separate data sets may be seen as samples
   taken from the same underlying distribution.  Using state of the art
   statistical methods, the equivalence of the results is verified.  To
   illustrate application of the process and methods defined here,
   evaluation of the One-way Delay Metric [RFC2679] is provided in an
   Appendix.  While test setups will vary with the metrics to be
   validated, the general methodology of determining equivalent results
   will not.  Documents defining test setups to evaluate other metrics
   should be developed once the process proposed here has been agreed
   and approved.

   o  Additional examples and a glossary.

   Changes from -00 to -01 version

   o  Addition of a comparison of individual metric implementations
      against the metric specification (trying to pick up problems and
      solutions for metric advancement [morton-advance-metrics]).

   o  More emphasis on the requirement to carefully design and document
      the measurement setup of the metric comparison.

   o  Proposal of testing conditions under identical WAN network
      conditions using IP in IP tunneling or Pseudo Wires and parallel
      measurement streams.

   o  Proposing the requirement to document the smallest resolution at
      which an ADK test was passed by 95%.  As no minimum resolution is
      specified, IPPM metric compliance is not linked to a particular
      performance of an implementation.

   o  Reference to RFC 2330 and RFC 2679 for the 95% confidence interval
      as preferred criterion to decide on statistical equivalence

   o  Reducing the proposed statistical test to ADK with 95% confidence.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Basic idea

   The implementation of a standard compliant metric is expected to meet
   the requirements of the related metric specification.  So before
   comparing two metric implementations, each metric implementation is
   individually compared against the metric specification.

   Most metric specifications leave freedom to implementors on non-
   fundamental aspects of an individual metric (or options).  Comparing
   different measurement results using a statistical test with the
   assumption of identical test path and testing conditions requires
   knowledge of all differences in the overall test setup.  Metric
   specification options chosen by implementors have to be documented.
   It is REQUIRED to use identical implementation options wherever
   possible for any test proposed here.  Calibrations proposed by metric
   standards should be performed to further identify (and possibly



Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   reduce) potential sources of errors in the test setup.

   The Framework for IP Performance Metrics [RFC2330] expects that a
   "methodology for a metric should have the property that it is
   repeatable: if the methodology is used multiple times under identical
   conditions, it should result in consistent measurements."  This means
   an implementation is expected to repeatedly measure a metric with
   consistent results (repeatability with the same result).  Small
   deviations in the test setup are expected to lead to small deviations
   in results only.  To characterise statistical equivalence in the case
   of small deviations, RFC 2330 and [RFC2679] suggest to apply a 95%
   confidence interval.  Quoting RFC 2679, "95 percent was chosen
   because ... a particular confidence level should be specified so that
   the results of independent implementations can be compared."

   Two different implementations are expected to produce statistically
   equivalent results if they both measure a metric under the same
   networking conditions.  Formulating in statistical terms: separate
   metric implementations collect separate samples from the same
   underlying statistical process (the same network conditions).  The
   statistical hypothesis to be tested is the expectation that both
   samples do not expose statistically different properties.  This
   requires careful test design:

   o  The measurement test setup must be self-consistent to the largest
      possible extent.  To minimize the influence of the test and
      measurement setup on the result, network conditions and paths MUST
      be identical for the compared implementations to the largest
      possible degree.  This includes both the stability and non-
      ambiguity of routes taken by the measurement packets.  See RFC
      2330 for a discussion on self-consistency.

   o  The error induced by the sample size must be small enough to
      minimize its influence on the test result.  This may have to be
      respected, especially if two implementations measure with
      different average probing rates.

   o  Every comparison must be repeated several times based on different
      measurement data to avoid random indications of compatibility (or
      the lack of it).

   o  To minimize the influence of implementation options on the result,
      metric implementations SHOULD use identical options and parameters
      for the metric under evaluation.

   o  The implementation with the lowest probing frequency determines
      the smallest temporal interval for which samples can be compared.

   The metric specifications themselves are the primary focus of
   evaluation, rather than the implementations of metrics.  The
   documentation produced by the advancement process should identify
   which metric definitions and supporting material were found to be
   clearly worded and unambiguous, OR, it should identify ways in which
   the metric specification text should be revised to achieve clarity
   and unified interpretation.

   The process should also permit identification of options that were
   not implemented, so that they can be removed from the advancing
   specification (this is an aspect more typical of protocol advancement
   along the standards track).

   Note that this document does not propose to base interoperability
   indications of performance metric implementations on comparisons of
   individual singletons.  Individual singletons may be impacted by many
   statistical effects while they are measured.  Comparing two
   singletons of different implementations may result in failures with
   higher probability than comparing samples.


3.  Verification of conformance to a metric specification

   This section specifies how to verify compliance of two or more IPPM
   implementations against a metric specification.  This document only
   proposes a general methodology.  Compliance criteria to a specific
   metric implementation need to be defined for each individual metric
   specification.  The only exception is the statistical test comparing
   two metric implementations which are simultaneously tested.  This
   test is applicable without metric specific decision criteria.

3.1.  Tests of an individual implementation against a metric
      specification

   A metric implementation MUST support the requirements classified as
   "MUST" and "REQUIRED" of the related metric specification to be
   compliant to the latter.

   Further, supported options of a metric implementation SHOULD be
   documented in sufficient detail.  The documentation of chosen options
   is RECOMMENDED to minimise (and recognise) differences in the test
   setup if two metric implementations are compared.  Further, this
   documentation is used to validate and improve the underlying metric
   specification option, to remove options which saw no implementation
   or which are badly specified from the metric specification to be
   promoted to a standard.  This documentation SHOULD be made for all
   implementation relevant specifications of a metric picked for a
   comparison, which aren't explicitly marked as "MUST" or "REQUIRED" in



Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   the metric specification.  This applies for the following sections of
   all metric specifications:

   o  Singleton Definition of the Metric.

   o  Sample Definition of the Metric.

   o  Statistics Definition of the Metric.  As statistics are compared
      by the test specified here, this documentation is required even in
      the case, that the metric specification does not contain a
      Statistics Definition.

   o  Timing and Synchronisation related specification (if relevant for
      the Metric).

   o  Any other technical part present or missing in the metric
      specification, which is relevant for the implementation of the
      Metric.

   RFC2330 and RFC2679 emphasise precision as an aim of IPPM metric
   implementations.  A single IPPM conformant implementation MUST under
   otherwise identical network conditions produce precise results for
   repeated measurements of the same metric.

   RFC 2330 prefers the "empirical distribution function" EDF to
   describe collections of measurements.  RFC 2330 determines, that
   "unless otherwise stated, IPPM goodness-of-fit tests are done using
   5% significance."  The goodness of fit test determines by which
   precision two or more samples of a metric implementation belong to
   the same underlying distribution (of measured network performance
   events).  The goodness of fit test to be applied is the Anderson-
   Darling K sample test (ADK sample test, K stands for the number of
   samples to be compared) [ADK].  Please note that RFC 2330 and RFC
   2679 apply an Anderson Darling goodness of fit test too.

   The results of a repeated test with a single implementation MUST pass
   an ADK sample test with confidence level of 95%.  The resolution for
   which the ADK test has been passed with the specified confidence
   level MUST be documented.  To formulate this differently: The
   requirement is to document the smallest resolution, at which the
   results of the tested metric implementation pass an ADK test with a
   confidence level of 95%.  The minimum resolution available in the
   reported results from each implementation MUST be taken into account
   in the ADK test.

3.2.  Test setup resulting in identical live network testing conditions

   Two major issues complicate tests for metric compliance across live
   networks under identical testing conditions.  One is the general
   point that metric definition implementations cannot be conveniently
   examined in field measurement scenarios.  The other one is more
   broadly described as "parallelism in devices and networks", including
   mechanisms like those that achieve load balancing (see [RFC4818]).

   This section proposes two measures to deal with both issues.
   Tunneling mechanisms can be used to avoid parallel processing of
   different flows in the network.  Measuring by separate parallel probe
   flows results in repeated collection of data.  If both measures are
   combined, WAN network conditions are identical for a number of
   independent measurement flows, no matter what the network conditions
   are in detail.

   Any measurement setup MUST be made to avoid the probing traffic
   itself to impede the metric measurement.  The created measurement
   load MUST NOT result in congestion at the access link connecting the
   measurement implementation to the WAN.  The created measurement load
   MUST NOT overload the measurement implementation itself, eg. by
   causing a high CPU load or by creating imprecisions due to internal
   transmit (receive respectively) probe packet collisions.

   IP in IP tunnels can be used to avoid Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
   routing of different measurement streams if they carry inner IP
   packets from different senders in a single tunnel with the same outer
   origin and destination address as well as the same port numbers.

   >>>> Comment: The author is not an expert on tunneling and
   appreciates guidance on the applicability of one or more of the
   following protocols: IP in IP [RFC2003] or L2TP [RFC2661] or
   [RFC3931].RFC 4928 [RFC4928] proposes measures how to avoid ECMP
   treatment in MPLS networks.

   By applying 802.1Q VLANs combined with an Ethernet port based tunnel
   mechanism likeGeneric Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC2784] or
   Ethernet Pseudo Wires [RFC4448] the desired test environment can be
   set up (see Figures 1 and 2).  By this solution, Ethernet frames are
   transmitted, containing the measurement packets.  The IP packet size
   of the metric implementation SHOULD be chosen small enough to avoid
   fragmentation due to tghe added Ethernet and tunnel headers.

   If tunneling is applied, two tunnels MUST carry all test traffic in
   between the test site and the remote site.  For example, if 802.1Q
   Ethernet Virtual LANs (VLAN) are applied and the measurement streams
   are carried in different VLANs, the GRE tunnel or Pseudo Wires



Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   respectively MUST be set up in physical port mode to avoid set up of
   Pseudo Wires per VLAN (which may see different paths due to ECMP
   routing), see RFC 4448.  The remote router and the Ethernet switch
   shown in figure 2 must support 802.1Q in this set up.

   The tunneled packets carry an overhead.  To avoid fragmentation in
   the Internet, it is suggested to limit the size of the test packets.
   The following headers are added if VLANs and GRE tunnels are applied:

   o  Ethernet 802.1Q: 22 Byte.

   o  GRE Header: 8 Byte.

   o  IPv4 Header (outer IP header): 20 Byte.

   o  MPLS Labels may be added by a carrier.  Each MPLS Label has a
      length of 4 Bytes.  By the time of writing, between 1 and 4 Labels
      seems to be a fair guess of what's expectable.

   Each test is repeated several times.  WAN conditions may change over
   time.  Sequential testing is desirable, but may not be a useful
   metric test option.  However tests can be carried out by establishing
   n different parallel measurement flows.  Two or three linecards per
   implementation serving to send or receive measurement flows should be
   sufficient to create 5 or more parallel measurement flows.  If three
   linecards are used, each card sends and receives 2 flows.  Other
   options are to separate flows by DiffServ marks (without deploying
   any QoS in the inner or outer tunnel) or using a single CBR flow and
   evaluating every n-th singleton to belong to a specific measurement
   flow.  Tunneling setups like the one proposed by GRE encapsulated
   multicast probing [GU+Duffield] should be applied (note that one or
   more remote tunnel end points and the same number of additional
   routers are required).

   An illustration of a test setup with two tunnels and two flows
   between two linecards of one implementation is given in Figure 1.

   Some additional rules to calculate and compare samples have to be
   respected to perform a metric test:




Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   o  To compare different probes of a common underlying distribution in
      terms of metrics characterising a communication network requires
      to respect the temporal nature for which the assumption of common
      underlying distribution may hold.  Any singletons or samples to be
      compared MUST be captured within the same time interval.

   o  Whenever statistical events like singletons or rates are used to
      characterise measured metrics of a time-interval, at least 5
      singletons of a relevant metric SHOULD be present to ensure a
      minimum confidence into the reported value (see Wikipedia on
      confidence [Rule of thumb]).  Note that this criterion also is to
      be respected e.g. when comparing packet loss metrics.  Any packet
      loss measurement interval to be compared with the results of
      another implementation SHOULD contain at least five lost packets
      to have a minimum confidence that the observed loss rate wasn't
      caused by a small number of random packet drops.

   o  The minimum number of singletons or samples to be compared by an
      Anderson-Darling test SHOULD be 100 per tested metric
      implementation.  Note that the Anderson-Darling test detects small
      differences in distributions fairly well and will fail for high
      number of compared results (RFC2330 mentions an example with 8192
      measurements where an Anderson-Darling test always failed).

   o  Generally, the Anderson-Darling test is sensitive to differences
      in the accuracy or bias associated with varying implementations or
      test conditions.  These dissimilarities may result in differing
      averages of samples to be compared.  An example may be different
      packet sizes, resulting in a constant delay difference between
      compared samples.  Therefore samples to be compared by an Anderson
      Darling test MAY be calibrated by the difference of the average
      values of the samples.  Any calibration of this kind MUST be
      documented in the test result.

3.3.  Tests of two or more different implementations against a metric
      specification

   RFC2330 expects "a methodology for a given metric [to] exhibit
   continuity if, for small variations in conditions, it results in
   small variations in the resulting measurements.  Slightly more
   precisely, for every positive epsilon, there exists a positive delta,
   such that if two sets of conditions are within delta of each other,
   then the resulting measurements will be within epsilon of each
   other."  A small variation in conditions in the context of the metric
   test proposed here can be seen as different implementations measuring
   the same metric along the same path.

   IPPM metric specification however allow for implementor options to



Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   the largest possible degree.  It can't be expected that two
   implementors pick identical options for the implementations.
   Implementors SHOULD to the highest degree possible pick the same
   configurations for their systems when comparing their implementations
   by a metric test.

   In some cases, a goodness of fit test may not be possible or show
   disappointing results.  To clarify the difficulties arising from
   different implementation options, the individual options picked for
   every compared implementation SHOULD be documented in sufficient
   detail.  Based on this documentation, the underlying metric
   specification should be improved before it is promoted to a standard.

   The same statistical test as applicable to quantify precision of a
   single metric implementation MUST be passed to compare metric
   conformance of different implementations.  To document compatibility,
   the smallest measurement resolution at which the compared
   implementations passed the ADK sample test MUST be documented.

   For different implementations of the same metric, "variations in
   conditions" are reasonably expected.  The ADK test comparing samples
   of the different implementations may result in a lower precision than
   the test for precision of each implementation individually.

3.4.  Clock synchronisation

   Clock synchronization effects require special attention.  Accuracy of
   one-way active delay measurements for any metrics implementation
   depends on clock synchronization between the source and destination
   of tests.  Ideally, one-way active delay measurement (RFC 2679,
   [RFC2679]) test endpoints either have direct access to independent
   GPS or CDMA-based time sources or indirect access to nearby NTP
   primary (stratum 1) time sources, equipped with GPS receivers.
   Access to these time sources may not be available at all test
   locations associated with different Internet paths, for a variety of
   reasons out of scope of this document.

   When secondary (stratum 2 and above) time sources are used with NTP
   running across the same network, whose metrics are subject to
   comparative implementation tests, network impairments can affect
   clock synchronization, distort sample one-way values and their
   interval statistics.  It is RECOMMENDED to discard sample one-way
   delay values for any implementation, when one of the following
   reliability conditions is met:

   o  Delay is measured and is finite in one direction, but not the
      other.




Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   o  Absolute value of the difference between the sum of one-way
      measurements in both directions and round-trip measurement is
      greater than X% of the latter value.

   Examination of the second condition requires RTT measurement for
   reference, e.g., based on TWAMP (RFC5357, RFC 5357 [RFC5357]), in
   conjunction with one-way delay measurement.

   Specification of X% to strike a balance between identification of
   unreliable one-way delay samples and misidentification of reliable
   samples under a wide range of Internet path RTTs probably requires
   further study.

   An IPPM compliant metric implementation whose measurement requires
   synchronized clocks is however expected to provide precise
   measurement results.  Any IPPM metric implementation MUST be of a
   precision of 1 ms (+/- 500 us) with a confidence of 95% if the metric
   is captured along an Internet path which is stable and not congested
   during a measurement duration of an hour or more.  [Editor: this
   latter definition may avoid NTP (stratum 2 or worse) synchronized
   IPPM implementations from becoming IPPM compliant.  However internal
   PC clock synched implementations can't be rejected that way.

   >>>> Comment: Ideas on criteria to deal with the latter are welcome.
   May drift be one, as GPS synched implementations shouldn't have one
   or the same on origin and destination, respectively.]

3.5.  Recommended Metric Verification Measurement Process

   In order to meet their obligations under the IETF Standards Process
   the IESG must be convinced that each metric specification advanced to
   Draft Standard or Internet Standard status is clearly written, that
   there are the required multiple verifiably equivalent
   implementations, and that all options have been implemented.

   In the context of this document, metrics are designed to measure some
   characteristic of a data network.  An aim of any metric definition
   should be that it should be specified in a way that can reliably
   measure the specific characteristic in a repeatable way.

   Each metric, statistic or option of those to be validated MUST be
   compared against a reference measurement or another implementation by
   at least 5 different basic data sets, each one with sufficient size
   to reach the specified level of confidence, as specified by this
   document.

   Finally, the metric definitions, embodied in the text of the RFCs,
   are the objects that require evaluation and possible revision in



Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   order to advance to the next step on the standards track.

   IF two (or more) implementations do not measure an equivalent metric
   as specified by this document,

   AND sources of measurement error do not adequately explain the lack
   of agreement,

   THEN the details of each implementation should be audited along with
   the exact definition text, to determine if there is a lack of clarity
   that has caused the implementations to vary in a way that affects the
   correspondence of the results.

   IF there was a lack of clarity or multiple legitimate interpretations
   of the definition text,

   THEN the text should be modified and the resulting memo proposed for
   consensus and advancement along the standards track.

   The complete process of advancing a metric specification to a
   standard as defined by this document is illustrated in Figure 3.

   Any recommendation for the advancement of a metric specification MUST
   be accompanied by an implementation report, as is the case with all
   requests for the advancement of IETF specifications.  The
   implementation report needs to include the tests performed, the
   applied test setup, the specific metrics in the RFC and reports of
   the tests performed with two or more implementations.  The test plan
   needs to specify the precision reached for each measured metric and
   thus define the meaning of "statistically equivalent" for the
   specific metrics being tested.

   Ideally, the test plan would co-evolve with the development of the
   metric, since that's when people have the most context in their
   thinking regarding the different subtleties that can arise.

   In particular, the implementation report MUST as a minimum document:

   o  The metric compared and the RFC specifying it.  This includes
      statements as required by the section "Tests of an individual
      implementation against a metric specification" of this document.

   o  The measurement configuration and setup.

   o  A complete specification of the measurement stream (mean rate,
      statistical distribution of packets, packet size or mean packet
      size and their distribution), DSCP and any other measurement
      stream properties which could result in deviating results.
      Deviations in results can be caused also if chosen IP addresses
      and ports of different implementations can result in different
      layer 2 or layer 3 paths due to operation of Equal Cost Multi-Path
      routing in an operational network.

   o  The duration of each measurement to be used for a metric
      validation, the number of measurement points collected for each
      metric during each measurement interval (i.e. the probe size) and
      the level of confidence derived from this probe size for each
      measurement interval.

   o  The result of the statistical tests performed for each metric
      validation as required by the section "Tests of two or more
      different implementations against a metric specification" of this
      document.

   o  A parameterization of laboratory conditions and applied traffic
      and network conditions allowing reproduction of these laboratory
      conditions for readers of the implementation report.

   o  The documentation helping to improve metric specifications defined
      by this section.



Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   All of the tests for each set SHOULD be run in a test setup as
   specified in the section "Test setup resulting in identical live
   network testing conditions."

   If a different test set up is chosen, it is RECOMMENDED to avoid
   effects falsifying results of validation measurements caused by real
   data networks (like parallelism in devices and networks).  Data
   networks may forward packets differently in the case of:

   o  Different packet sizes chosen for different metric
      implementations.  A proposed countermeasure is selecting the same
      packet size when validating results of two samples or a sample
      against an original distribution.

   o  Selection of differing IP addresses and ports used by different
      metric implementations during metric validation tests.  If ECMP is
      applied on IP or MPLS level, different paths can result (note that
      it may be impossible to detect an MPLS ECMP path from an IP
      endpoint).  A proposed counter measure is to connect the
      measurement equipment to be compared by a NAT device, or
      establishing a single tunnel to transport all measurement traffic
      The aim is to have the same IP addresses and port for all
      measurement packets or to avoid ECMP based local routing diversion
      by using a layer 2 tunnel.

   o  Different IP options.

   o  Different DSCP.

   o  If the five measurements are captured by repeated measurements
      instead of simultaneous ones: Changing pathes and load conditions
      time.

3.6.  Miscellaneous

   In the case that a metric validation requires capturing rare events,
   an impairment generator may have to be added to the test set up.
   Inclusion of an impairment generator and the parameterisation of the
   impairments generated MUST be documented.  Rare events could be
   packet duplications, packet loss rates above one digit percentages,
   loss patterns or packet re-ordering and so on.

   As specified above, 5 singletons are the recommended basis to
   minimise interference of random events with the statistical test
   proposed by this document.  In the case of ratio measurements (like
   packet loss), the underlying sum of basic events, against the which
   the metric's monitored singletons are "rated", determines the
   resolution of the test.  A packet loss statistic with a resolution of



Geib, et al.             Expires August 15, 2010               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   1% requires one packet loss statistic-datapoint to consist of 500
   delay singletons (of which at least 5 were lost).  To compare EDFs on
   packet loss requires one hundred such statistics per flow.  That
   means, all in all at least 50 000 delay singletons are required per
   single measurement flow.  Live network packet loss is assumed to be
   present during main traffic hours only.  Let this interval be 5
   hours.  The required minimum rate of a single measurement flow in
   that case is 2.8 packets/sec (assuming a loss of 1% during 5 hours).
   If this measurement is too demanding under live network conditions,
   an impairment generator should be used.

Appendix A.  An example on a One-way Delay metric validation

   The text of this appendix is not binding.  It is an example how parts
   of a One-way Delay metric test could look like.
   http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/bibxml/

A.1.  Compliance to Metric specification requirements

   One-way Delay, Loss threshold, RFC 2679

   This test determines if implementations use the same configured
   maximum waiting time delay from one measurement to another under
   different delay conditions, and correctly declare packets arriving in
   excess of the waiting time threshold as lost.  See Section 3.5 of
   RFC2679, 3rd bullet point and also Section 3.8.2 of RFC2679.

   (1)  Configure a path with 1 sec one-way constant delay.

   (2)  Measure one-way delay with 2 or more implementations, using
        identical waiting time thresholds for loss set at 2 seconds.

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   (3)  Configure the path with 3 sec one-way delay.

   (4)  Repeat measurements.

   (5)  Observe that the increase measured in step 4 caused all packets
        to be declared lost, and that all packets that arrive
        successfully in step 2 are assigned a valid one-way delay.

   One-way Delay, First-bit to Last bit, RFC 2679

   This test determines if implementations register the same relative
   increase in delay from one measurement to another under different
   delay conditions.  This test tends to cancel the sources of error
   which may be present in an implementation.  See Section 3.7.2 of
   RFC2679, and Section 10.2 of RFC2330.

   (1)  Configure a path with X ms one-way constant delay, and ideally
        including a low-speed link.

   (2)  Measure one-way delay with 2 or more implementations, using
        identical options and equal size small packets (e.g., 100 octet
        IP payload).

   (3)  Maintain the same path with X ms one-way delay.

   (4)  Measure one-way delay with 2 or more implementations, using
        identical options and equal size large packets (e.g., 1500 octet
        IP payload).

   (5)  Observe that the increase measured in steps 2 and 4 is
        equivalent to the increase in ms expected due to the larger
        serialization time for each implementation.  Most of the
        measurement errors in each system should cancel, if they are
        stationary.

   One-way Delay, RFC 2679

   This test determines if implementations register the same relative
   increase in delay from one measurement to another under different
   delay conditions.  This test tends to cancel the sources of error
   which may be present in an implementation.  This test is intended to
   evaluate measurments in sections 3 and 4 of RFC2679.

   (1)  Configure a path with X ms one-way constant delay.

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard advancement testing      February 2010


   (2)  Measure one-way delay with 2 or more implementations, using
        identical options.

   (3)  Configure the path with X+Y ms one-way delay.

   (4)  Repeat measurements.

   (5)  Observe that the increase measured in steps 2 and 4 is ~Y ms for
        each implementation.  Most of the measurement errors in each
        system should cancel, if they are stationary.

   Error Calibration, RFC 2679

   This is a simple check to determine if an implementation reports the
   error calibration as required in Section 4.8 of RFC2679.  Note that
   the context (Type-P) must also be reported.

A.2.  Examples related to statistical tests for One-way Delay

   A one way delay measurement may pass an ADK test with a timestamp
   resultion of 1 ms.  The same test may fail, if timestamps with a
   resolution of 100 microseconds are eavluated.  The implementation
   then is then conforming to the metric specification up to a timestamp
   resolution of 1 ms.

   Let's assume another one way delay measurement comparison between
   implementation 1, probing with a frequency of 2 probes per second and
   implementation 2 probing at a rate of 2 probes every 3 minutes.  To
   ensure reasonable confidence in results, sample metrics are
   calculated from at least 5 singletons per compared time interval.
   This means, sample delay values are calculated for each system for
   identical 6 minute intervals for the whole test duration.  Per 6
   minute interval, the sample metric is calculated from 720 singletons
   for implementation 1 and from 6 singletons for implementation 2.
   Note, that if outliers are not filtered, moving averages are an
   option for an evaluation too.  The minimum move of an averaging
   interval is three minutes in this example.

   The data in table 1 may result from measuring One-Way Delay with
   implementation 1 (see column Implemnt_1) and implementation 2 (see
   column implemnt_2).  Each data point in the table represents a
   (rounded) average of the sampled delay values per interval.  The
   resolution of the clock is one micro-second.  The difference in the
   delay values may result eg. from different probe packet sizes.

         +------------+------------+-----------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   Average values of sample metrics captured during identical time
   intervals are compared.  This excludes random differences caused by
   differing probing intervals or differing temporal distance of
   singletons resulting from their Poisson distributed sending times.

   In the example, 20 values have been picked (note that at least 100
   values are recommended for a single run of a real test).  Data must
   be ordered by ascending rank.  The data of Implemnt_1 and Implemnt_2
   as shown in the first two columns of table 1 clearly fails an ADK
   test with 95% confidence.

   The results of Implemnt_2 are now reduced by difference of the
   averages of column 2 (rounded to 6581 us) and column 1 (rounded to
   5029 us), which is 1552 us.  The result may be found in column 3 of
   table 1.  Comparing column 1 and column 3 of the table by an ADK test
   shows, that the data contained in these columns passes an ADK tests
   with 95% confidence.

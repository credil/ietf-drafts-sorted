      <t>This document proposes a limited set of interconnection QoS PHBs and 
      PHB groups. It further introduces some DiffServ deployment aspects. The proposals

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This draft proposes a DiffServ interconnection class and 
      codepoint scheme. At least one party of an interconnection often is a 
      network provider. Aggregated DiffServ classes are often deployed 
      within provider networks. To respect this, this draft also contains 
      concepts and current practice relevant for a revised version of 
      <xref target="RFC5127">
      RFC5127</xref>. Its main purpose is to be considered as an input for the 
      latter task.</t>

      <t>DiffServ sees deployment in many networks for the time being. As 
      described in the introduction of the <xref target="I-D.polk-tsvwg-diffserv-stds-problem-statement">
      draft diffserv problem statement</xref>, remarking of packets at domain 
      boundaries is a DiffServ feature. This draft proposes a set of standard 
      QoS classes and codepoints at interconnection points to which and from 
      which locally used classes and codepoints should be mapped. Such a scheme 
      simplifies interconnection negotiations and ensures that end to end class 
      properties remain roughly the same, even if codepoints change.</t>

      <t>The proposed Interconnection class and codepoint scheme tries to 
      reflect and consolidate related DiffServ and QoS standardisation efforts 
      outside of the IETF, namely MEF, GSMA and ITU.</t>

      <t>IP Precedence has been depricated when DiffServ was standardised. It 
       is common practice today however to copy the DSCPs "IP Precedence Bits" 
       into MPLS TC or Ethernet P-Bits, whenever possible. This is reflected 
       by the DiffServ codepoint definitions of AF and EF. This practice and 
       it's limits deserve to be documented and disussed briefly.</t>

      <t>The draft further adds proposes a philosophy how to add or 
      pick aggregated DiffServ classes. The set of available router and traffic 
      management tools to configure and operate DiffServ classes is limited. 
      This should be reflected by class definitions. These may in the end be  
      more related to transport properties than to application requirements. 
      Please interpret transport properties as "congestion aware" and "not 
      congestion aware" rather then TCP or UDP.</t>


      <t>Finally, this draft proposes to leave some MPLS TC codepoint space to 
      allow for future DiffServ extensions like ECN/PCN and domain internal 
      classes (network management traffic is a good example for the latter).</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      
      <t>A later version of this draft needs to be clearer on that. The author 
      prefers to talk of QoS classes. PHB or PHB groups are not commonly used, 
      although they are better defined. An issue is, that PHB groups, which 
      e.g. allow to offer two or more different drop levels (PHB's) within 
      one PHB group , hardly saw commercial deployment. This may change 
      with more Ethernet services being offered.</t>

          <c>A class is a set of one or more PHBs. If a class consists of a 
             set of PHBs and these obey to an ordering constraint. In that 
             sense, a class is a single AF class <xref target="RFC2597">(e.g. AF4 consisting of 
             AF41, AF41 and AF43)</xref>. A class is a <xref target="RFC2575">PHB group</xref> 
             and a <xref target="RFC3260">PHB scheduling class</xref>. On IP level all DSCPs sharing the 
             same IP precedence value belong to a single class. A class may 
             consist of one or more PHBs. A single class uses forwarding resources, 
             which are independent of the forwarding rseources of any other class.

      <t>Many DiffServ related RFCs introduce new terminolgy duplicating the 
      existing one. The above references are incomplete and refer to the early 
      DiffServ RFCs only. Stopping terminology duplication may simplify discussion.</t>


      <t>The following current practice issues relate to the concept of the DiffServ 
      interconnection class propsal rather than to terminology. They serve as
      additional motivation of this activity:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Abstract class names like "EF" are preferrential over those 
          being close to an application, like "Voice". Unfortunately, 
          non QoS experts can't handle abstract class names. Hence and usually 
          sooner than later, classes are named for applications or groups 
          of them. One consequence however is, that people tend to combine 
          application group class names and SLA parameters. Based on an application 
          specific name and some worst case performance numbers on a paper, 
          they often decide that their application needs a separate new 
          QoS class.</t>

          <t>Worse than that, but very present in practice, is the class 
          abstraction level which is preferred by those dealing with QoS 
          (as experts or non experts): the DSCPs or the IP precedence values. 
          These are the commodity abstractions applied for QoS classes. Most 
          of these persons have fixed class to codepoint mappings in their 
          minds, which they can't easily adapt on a per customer or 
          interconnection partner basis. </t>
      </list></t> 
      
      <t>While these issues aren't to be solved by IETF (QoS experts 
      could and should of course teach staff to use proper Diffserv 
      terminology and concepts), a simple and comprehensible QoS interconnection 
      class scheme also is helpful in this area.</t>
    </section>
      

    <section title="An Interconnection class and codepoint scheme">
      
      <t>DiffServ deployments mostly follow loose class specification schemes 
      (often one or two AF classes, EF and Best Effort). Especially 
      DSCP assignment for the AF classes varies between deployments.  
      Basic AF class definitions are often similar however. This is in line 
      with the DiffServ architecture. This document doesn't propose to 
      change that.</t>

      <t>Interconnecting parties face the problem of matching classes 
      to be interconnected and then to agree on codepoint mapping. As stated 
      by <xref target="I-D.polk-tsvwg-diffserv-stds-problem-statement">
      draft diffserv prolebm statement</xref>, remarking is a standard 
      behaviour at interconnection interfaces. This draft propses a set of 
      4 QoS classes with a set of well defined DSCPs and IP-Precedence values
      as interconnection class and codepoint scheme. A sending party remarks DSCPs 
      from internal schemes to the Interconnection codepoints. The 
      receiving party remarks IP-Precedence and or DSCPs to their internal 
      scheme. Thus the interconnection codepoint scheme fully complies with 
      the DiffServ architecture. Such an interconnection class and codepoint 
      scheme was introduced by <xref target="Y.1566">ITU-T</xref> (there also 
      includuíng Ethernet). It is specified to a higher level of detail in 
      this document.</t>

      <t>At first glance, this looks like an additional effort. But there are 
      obvious benefits: each party sending or receiving traffic has to 
      specify the mapping from or to the interconnection class and codepoint 
      scheme only once. Without it, this is to be negotiated per 
      interconnection party individually. Further, end-to-end QoS in terms 
      of traffic being classified for the same class in all passed domains 
      is likely to result if an interconnection codepoint scheme is used. It 
      is not necessarily resulting from individual per network mapping 
      negotiations.</t>

      <t>The standards and deployments known to the author of this 
      draft are limited to 4 DiffServ classes at interconnection points (or 
      less).<xref target="I-D.polk-tsvwg-rfc4594-update">
      Draft RFC 4597 update </xref>doesn't seem to generally contradict 
      to this, as it proposes to standardise "many services classes, not all 
      will be used in each network at any period of time." Some more 
      good reasons fovour working with 4 DiffServ interconnection classes for
      now:</t>
      
      <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>There should be a coding reserve for interconnection classes, leaving 
      space for future standards, for bilateral agreements and for carrier 
      internal classes.</t>
      <t>MPLS and Ethernet support only 8 PHBs, classes or ECN indications. 
      Assignment of codepoints for whatever purpose must be well thought through. 
      Limiting interconnection QoS to four classes is MPLS and Ethernet friendly 
      in that sense.</t>
      <t>Migrations from one codepoint scheme to another may require spare 
      QoS codepoints.</t>

      </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Consolidation of QoS standards by the interconnection codepoint scheme">
      
      <t>The interconnection class and codepoint scheme proposed by Y.1566 also 
      tries to consolidate related DiffServ and QoS standardisation efforts 
      outside of <xref target="Y.1566"> the IETF</xref>. The interconnection class and 
      codepoint scheme may be a suitable approach to consolidate these standards.
      MEF 23.1 specifies 3 aggregated classes, consuming up to 5 codepoints on 
      Ethernet layer (EF, AF3 and AF1 and Best Effort) 
      and <xref target="MEF23.1"> 6 PHBs </xref>. MEF aggregates AF1 and Default 
      PHB in a single class. This is not recommended for interconnection, 
      as it is not in line with RFC 2597 (which requires separate forwarding 
      resources for each AF class and doesn't forsee aggregation of Default PHB 
      and an AF class).</t> 

     <t>GSMA IR.34 proposes four classes, EF, AF4, another AF class and 
      Best Effort with <xref target="IR.34"> 7 PHBs in sum</xref>. IR.34 specifies 
      an "Interactive" class consisting of 3 PHBs with fifferent drop priorities.
      IR.34 specfies the PHBS AF31, AF21 and AF11 for this Interactive class. 
      This definitely breaks RFC 2597. The interconnection class and codepoint scheme 
      supports the Interactive class but assigns AF3 with PHBs AF31, AF32 and AF33.</t>

     <t>The classes to be supported at interconnection interfaces are specified by 
      Y.1566 as:</t>

     <texttable anchor="table_intercon_class_scheme">
        <preamble> </preamble>
        <ttcol align="left">Class</ttcol>

        <ttcol align="left">Properties</ttcol>

          <c>Priority</c>

          <c>EF, expecting the figures of merit describing the PHB to be in the range 
          of low single digit milliseconds. <xref target="RFC3246">See</xref>.</c>

          <c>Bulk inelastic</c>

          <c>Traffic load in this class must be controlled, e.g. by application servers. 
          One example could be flow admission control. There may be infrequent 
          retransmissions requested by the application layer to mitigate low levels 
          of packet losses. Discard of packets through active queue management should 
          be avoided in this class. Congestion in this class may result in bursty packet 
          loss. If used to carry multimedia traffic, it is recommended to carry audio 
          and video traffic in a single PHB. All of these properties influence the 
          buffer design.</c>

          <c>Assured</c>

          <c>This class may be optimised to transport traffic without bandwidth requirements. 
          Retransmissions after losses characterise the class and influence the buffer design. 
          Active queue management with probabilistic dropping may be deployed.</c>

          <c>Default</c>

          <c>Default. This class may be optimised to transport traffic without bandwidth requirements. 
           Retransmissions after losses characterise the class and influence the buffer design. 
           Active queue management with probabilistic dropping may be deployed.</c>

         <postamble> </postamble>
      </texttable>

      <t>Note that other DiffServ related standards trim down class requirements to SLA parameters. 
      To quote e.g RFC 4594-update, "A "service class" represents a similar set of traffic 
      characteristics for delay, loss, and jitter as packets traverse routers in a network." This 
      draft adds traffic conditioning properties corresponding to expected transport layer 
      characteristics as a key factor to a class definition: the desired class performance like 
      delay, jitter and worst case loss are met only if conditioning and and transport properties 
      meet the ones described by the class definition.
      This is not to say, the other standards ignore conditioner properties. They are e.g. a core part 
      of RFC 4594-update. They do not directly refer to tranport protocol properties, as most 
      existing QoS standards prefer the approach of assigning QoS classes to applications or 
      application sets. This may result in undesirable class mappings, if an e.g. IP TV application
      demanding low loss is matched to a class whose low loss guarantees depend on AQM mechanisms.</t>  

      <t>Y.1566 does not recommend all PHBs to be supported at an interconnection 
      interface. This information is added by this draft. At interconnection points, 
      the following PHBs should be accepted between interconnected parties:</t>

    <section title="MPLS, Ethernet and IP Precedence for aggregated classes">      

      <t>IP Precedence has been depricated when DiffServ was standardised. 
      Ethernet and MPLS support 3 bit codepoint fields to differntiate service 
      quality. Mapping of the IP precedence to these 3 Bit fields has been 
      a configuration restriction in the early days of DiffServ. The concept
      of paying attention to the three most significant bits of a DSCP has 
      however been part of Diffserv from start on (EF's IP Precedence is 5, 
      that of AF4 is 4 and so on). The interconnection class and codepoint 
      scheme respects this in different ways:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>it allows to classify four interconnection classes based on IP 
          precedence.</t>

          <t>It supports a single PHB group (AF3), which may be mapped to up to
          three different MPLS TC's or Ethernet P-Bits. Note that this 
          draft doesn's favour or recommend doing that, but it is possible. 
          The author isn't aware of deployed service offers with 3 different 
          drop levels in a single class.</t>
      </list> </t>


      <t>This is of course no requirement to depricate any DSCP to MPLS TC 
      or Ethernet P-Bit mapping functionality. This functionality is very 
      important as well.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="QoS class name selection">   

      <t>This is more of an informational discussion, proposed best practice, and 
      mainly relates to human behviour (including QoS experts) rather than 
      technical issues. Above the human preference for conceivable class names 
      has been mentioned. Network engineers (including the former Diffserv WG 
      authors) recommend to avoid application related QoS class names. Focus 
      should be put on class properties. But these can be irritating again, as 
      just looking at SLA parameters like Delay, Jitter and packet loss don't 
      tell the reader, which conditioning and transport properties guideed 
      the class engineering assumptions resulted in the conditioning of 
      a class. A router produces QoS with a scheduling mechanism, a settable 
      queue depth and optional active queue management (including ECN), and may 
      be a policer. Some kind of resource management may be present (also in 
      Diffserv domains). It's beyond the imagination of the author how one 
      would engineer more than half a dozen classes with distinguishable 
      properties with this set of tools.</t>

      <t>There's no perfect solution to the problem, as conditioning configurations 
      are not comprehensible to most readers, even if they were communicated 
      (they are operational secrets of course). There are (or should be) 
      engineering assumptions, when designing QoS conditioners. But they closer 
      relate to layer 3 or layer 4 level properties than to specific 
      applications. In general, an application responds to congestion by 
      reducing traffic, or it ignores congestion. Active queue management 
      doesn't help to avoid congestion in the latter case, only resource 
      management does. EF may be a special case. If the EF traffic is not 
      responsive to congestion, and packets are assumed to be short, rather 
      small jitter values can be reached if enginieering ensures that the 
      packet arrival rate never exceeds the transmision rate of that queue 
      (see <xref target="RFC3246">RFC 3246</xref>). There's other non congestion-responsive traffic, for 
      which the EF engineering assumptions may not fit. So conditioning) 
      like bulk inelastic is reasonable.</t>

      <t>Active queue management may be deployed for QoS classes, 
      which are designed to transport traffic responding to congestion by

      and especially UDP_optimised are inappropriate as clas names, as some 
      UDP based application are or may be expected to become TCP friendly.</t>

    <section title="Allow for DiffServ extendability on MPLS and Ethernet level">   

      <t>Any aggregated Diffserv deployment faces codepoint depletion issues 
      rather soon, if deployed on MPLS or Ethernet. Coding space should be 
      left for new features, like ECN, PCN or Conex. In addition to carrying 
      customer traffic, internal routing and network management 
      traffic may be protected by using a separate class. Offering 
      interconnection with up to four classes and 4 - 6 MPLS TC's (or 
      Ethernet P-bits) to that respect is probably at least a 
      fair compromise. </t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

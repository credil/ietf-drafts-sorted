Abstract

   Many organizations have implemented and tested the internationalized
   email systems based on the key RFCs which have been published.  This
   document points out some problems, which blocks the receiver to
   receive the internationalized email address and may impede the
   deployment and use of the internationalized email address.  Knowing
   the problems will help the smooth deployment of Email Address
   Internationalization system.

Internet-Draft                  Problems                  September 2009


1.  Introduction

   The IETF has published five RFCs [RFC4952] [RFC5335] [RFC5336]
   [RFC5337] [RFC5504] about internationalized email addresses.  CNNIC
   has implemented these RFCs, does some tests and identify some
   problems during the initial deployment.  This document is mainly for
   pointing out the problems of blocking the use of internationalized
   email address that needs to be considered in the deployment.  The
   possible soultion to these poroblems can be found in the deployment
   document [DeploymentGuidelines].

1.1.  Role of this specification

   The framework document specifies the requirements for, and describes
   components of, full internationalization of email address.  The EAI
   SMTP extension document [RFC5336] specifies the SMTP extension to use
   the internationalized email address.  The EAI header document
   [RFC5335] allows the internationalized email address headers.  The
   EAI downgrade document [RFC5504] addresses how to downgrade to be
   compatible with the current non-EAI-system.  The deployment document
   [DeploymentGuidelines] addresses the possible solution to the
   problems identified in this document.

1.2.  Terminology

   All the specialized terms used in this specification are defined in
   the framework document [RFC4952], the EAI SMTP extension document
   [RFC5336], the EAI header document [RFC5335] and the base Internet
   email specifications [RFC5321] [RFC5322].  In particular, the terms
   "ASCII user", and "i18mail user" are used in this document according
   to the definitions in the framework one.

   [[anchor3: NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please remove the following text
   before publication.]]
   Some ideas of this specification is being discussed on the EAI
   mailing list.  See https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ima for
   information about subscribing.  The list's archive is at
   http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ima/index.html.


2.  Problem statment

   If the i18mail user sends the message with the internationalized
   email address which is successfuly received by the receiver without
   any downgrading, we define such sending as the successful sending of
   internationalized email address.  If the i18mail user sends the
   message with the internationalized email address because the SMTP
   client or mail user agent or submission server can not support

Internet-Draft                  Problems                  September 2009


   internationalized email address, refuse to send the message and
   result into the failure of sending of internationalized email
   address, we call it the failure operation.  In other situation, we
   call it the failure of the sending of internationalized email
   address.  In order to have more successful sending of
   internationalized email address, less downgrade operation or failure
   operation, we need identify the problems which block the successful
   sending of internationalized email address.


3.  Initial Implementation and Test

   As far as we know, CNNIC, TWNIC, AFILIAS, JPRS and NIDA have
   implemented the [RFC5335], [RFC5336], [RFC5504].  CNNIC updates the
   Postfix source code to support EAI.  [RFC5504].  The openweb mail is
   used for EAI clients.  Both TWNIC and AFILIAS update Sendmail.  JPRS
   uses C language to implement EAI.  NIDA uses python to implement it.
   CNNIC/TWNIC/JPRS/AFILIAS/NIDA have the co-tests based on the scenario
   documnent.  We summarize the following problems identified in our
   tests which may block the successful sending of internationalized
   email address.


4.  Problems identified in the initial implementation and test

   The key aim of EAI WG is to promote the use of internationalized
   email address.  In order to have the smooth operation of EAI system
   and have the success use of internationalized email address, we
   should address all the following problems before deploying the EAI
   systems.

4.1.  SMTP client

   If the SMTP client or submisstion server is not ready to support
   [RFC5335] and [RFC5336], the EAI mail user agent can not submit the
   email message to the SMTP client.  So it is impossible to receive the
   internationalized email address from the i18mail user.

4.2.  Relay Server

   If the relay server has not EAI-capability, it will not accept any
   UTF8SMTP message.  Some downgrading may happen.

4.3.  SMTP Server

   The SMTP server gets the message from the SMTP client.  If the SMTP
   server which is the final delivery server has not EAI-capability, the
   receiver can not get the i18n messages.

Internet-Draft                  Problems                  September 2009


4.4.  Email Filter

   Many email receivers have installed the email filters.  The non-EAI-
   capability filiters may regard EAI messages as the rubbish and drop
   them immediately.

4.5.  Firewall

   The traditional fireall specified in [RFC2979] will not understand
   the keyword "UTF8SMTP", These actions will lead to unnecessary
   message failure, and the SMTP connection will be cut off by the
   firewall.

4.6.  Mail User Agent

   Most non-EAI-capability Mail User Agent (MUA) can not support
   internationalized email address.  It will regard the
   internationalized email address as illegal and refuse to send the
   message on behalf of the i18nmail user.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideraton.


6.  Security Considerations

   See the extended security considerations discussion in the framework
   document [RFC4952].


7.  Acknowledgements

   Many ideas are from the discussion in the list ima@ietf.org.  John C
   Klensin has done a lot of reasearch on ASCII email address and
   internationalized email address.  I got many significant words or
   ideas from him.  Many friends and experts in the EAI WG help us to
   produce the valuable ideas.  Many organizations including CNNIC,
   TWNIC, JPRS, NIDA, AND AFFLILIAS have implemented EAI systems.  These
   organizations have already done a lot of inter-operating testing.

Abstract

   Anycast is applied in many protocols to provide automatically fault 
   recovery (high availability) and scalability, i.e Anycast RP in PIM, 
   Cooperative Home Agent and Cooperative Foreign Agent in Mobile IP. 

   When the Operator's engineer completing configuring an anycast group,
   they need a tool to check whether each group member can be reached
   by the anycast address (instead of by each member's  unicast address)

   When the anycast group members are changed, e.g. there are some new
   members added on, there are some old members deleted from the group,
   a tool is needed to check whether the changed group/member can be 
   reached by the anycast address as it should be.

   When an anycast group have been canceled by configuration, there need 
   a tool to check whether the anycast group configuration have been wiped 
   off from all group members.

   The existing method is to use existent PING command to ping the 
   anycast address. This existing method can only prove whether one 
   member in the anycast group instead of all members of the anycast 
   group identified by the anycast address can be reached by that 
   anycast address. Hence it cannot satisfy above problems.

   This document provides a solution to prove that each member of a 
   given anycast group can be arrived by that anycast address.

Internet-Draft    MADP in IPv4 Mobility Management        November  2008   


1.  Introduction

    Anycast is applied in many protocols to provide automatically fault 
    recovery (high availability) and scalability, i.e Anycast RP in PIM, 
    Cooperative Home Agent and Cooperative Foreign Agent in Mobile IP. 
    When operators deploying any anycast services, it has to group 
    several IP nodes into an Anycast group first. Hence the "anycast 
    group configuration information" has to be configured on each 
    member of an anycast group. The "anycast group configuration 
    information" includes at least the anycast address of the group and 
    all member's unicast IP addresses at least. By this "anycast group 
    configuration information", each  Anycast group member know it is a 
    member of that Anycast group, the group's IP address is the anycast 
    address,  and it can communicate with every other member by the 
    unicast IP address of them.

    When the network administrator or Operation & Maintaining engineer 
    completing configuring an anycast group, they need a tool to check 
    whether each group member can be reached by the anycast address 
    (instead of by each member's  unicast address.)

    When the anycast group members are changed, e.g. there are some new 
    members added on, there are some old members deleted form the group,
    a tool is needed by the Operator's engineer to check whether the 
    changed group/member can be reached by the anycast address as it 
    should be.

    When an anycast group have been canceled by configuration, there 
    need a tool to check whether the anycast group configuration have 
    been wiped off from all group members.

    The existing method is to use existent PING command to ping the 
    anycast address, and cannot staisfy above problems. 
    
     
    This document provides a solution for these requirements.

2.  Overview

   The basic idea is as follows:  
   
    1) Anycast Ping Still works by exchanging ICMP Informational 
    Messages (Echo Request Message and Echo Reply Message). To achieve 
    Anycast Ping, the responding member adds the all member's unicast IP 
    addresses in the Responding Echo Reply Message of the invoking Echo 
    Request message. The Ping host can get known that responding 
    member's unicast address by checking the source IP address of 
    received Responding Echo Reply message.   
       
    2) For each anycast group member, find out at least one "transfer 
    point": an IP host node or router node, anycast traffic sourced from 
    which and destined to the anycast group will arrive at that anycast
    group member.
    
    3) The Ping host sends N (N>=1) Echo Request Messages to each 
    "transfer point"  with a Type 0 Routing Header (IPv6)/ Loose Source 
    option (IPv4) in the IP packet carrying the message. The anycast 
    address is included in the routing header/ Loose Source option each 
    time. Then the ping host waits to receive the Echo Reply Messages 
    from different anycast member and decide each member's reachability.

    4) If the "transfer point" are in the administration domain of the 
    Operator, the Operator can also remotely login the "transfer point"
    , Ping the anycast address and observe the reachability of the 
    anycasr address by whether there is Echo Reply messages received on 
    each "transfer point". 

3.  Protocol Operation

    This section describes the Anycast Ping operations. 
           
    By "Anycast Ping", when a user wants to know the reachability of 
    each member of an anycast group, it first "Anycast Ping" the anycast
    address from a ping host. here "Anycast Ping"is a command which is 
    used to ping anycast address. 
    
    For a given anycast address, when a command "Anycast Ping" is 
    launched in a ping host, the following events will happen:

 1). Anycast configuration information check:
 
    The Ping host sends N(N>=1; Can be configured according to 
    policy. Default value is 5-the same as unicast ping ) Echo Request 
    Message to the destination anycast address.The responding member

Internet-Draft        A tool for checking AGC              November 2009

    
    reports "Anycast configuration information" by adding that 
    information configured on it into "Anycast Cnfiguration Information
    Option"(described in section 3.1) of the corresponding Echo Reply 
    Message.
        
    Hence the Ping host can know all members in the group so that it 
    can further check whether other members can be reached by the 
    anycast address. The Ping host can get known that responding 
    member's unicast address by checking the source IP address of 
    received Responding Echo Reply message.For this situation, go to 
    step 2). 
    
    If there is no any valid Echo Reply Message received after sending  
    Echo Request Messages, that means there is no anycast group 
    configured in the network domain for the given anycast address. For
    this situation, no further process, indication should be displayed 
    to the user: "no such anycast group configured yet!" 
    
    If there is valid Echo Reply Message without "Anycast Cnfiguration 
    Information Option" received after sending Echo Request Messages, 
    that means the given anycast group ia actually a unicast address. 
    For this situation, no further process, indication should be 
    displayed to the user: "Possible unicast address!" 
    
 2). Find "transfer point" for each group member
    
    After geeting known the anycast address configuration information by
    step 1). The ping host call the "Fingding out "transfer point"" 
    service (i.e. can be a SNMP service provided to authorized users) to
    get at least a "transfer point" for each group member.
    
    If there is no any "transfer point" found out for a given member, 
    the ping host should display to the user:"fail to find transfer 
    point for member X!", and continue to find out "transfer point" for 
    other members.
  
    If there is no any "transfer point" for each other member(means any 
    member of the given anycast group instead of the one responding 
    in step 1) of the given anycast group, display "all other members 
    are unreachable!" and end "Anycast Ping"
     
    For members there exists at least one "transfer point", go to step 
    3).  
   
 3). Check reachability of each member having "transfer point"
 
    Either of the two ways can be used by the ping host:

    A). Remote login
     
    The "tranfer points" should be in the administration domain of the 
    Operator. The ping host should also remotely login the transfer 
    points, and Ping the anycast address and display the reachability of 
    the anycast address by whether there is Echo Reply messages 
    received on each "transfer point".
    
    B). Using routing option or routing header
    
    The Ping host sends N (N>=1; Can be configured according to policy. 
    Default value is 5-the same as unicast ping ) Echo Request Message 
    to each "transfer point" with a Type 0 Routing Header (IPv6)/ Loose 
    Source option (IPv4) in the IP packet carrying the message. The 
    anycast address is included in the routing header/ Loose Source 
    option each time. Then the ping host waits to receive the Echo Reply
    Messages from different anycast member and decide each member's 
    reachability.
    
    For IPv4, Loose Source option has not been implemented and opened 
    to user widely in routers for security consideration and other 
    reasons. For IPv6,  there is similar problem though Type 0 Routing 
    Header is mandatary in IPv6 specified in [RFC2460]. Hence , above 
    way B) may be optional.
     
   
3.1. ICMP Echo Reply Message with Anycast Configuration Information 
     Option  

    In "Anycast Ping", what different from the ICMP Echo Reply Message 
    in "unicast Ping" is that an Anycast Configuration Information 
    Option is included in this "Anycast Ping" ICMP Echo Reply Message. 
    The Option includes: all member's unicast IP addresses and the 
    anycast address of the group. 
   
    For Both ICMPv4[RFC792] and ICMPv6[RFC4433], The position of Anycast
    Configuration Information Option in Echo Reply message is as 
    follows:

Internet-Draft        A tool for checking AGC              November 2009                                                   | 
    
    
    Means this option is an "Anycast Configuration Information Option"
    
    Length: 
    
    Contains the length of the overall length of all fields in this 
    option except the length of "Type", and "Length", as well as 
    "Reserved", in units of 32-bit words.  
    
    Reserved: 
    
    The Reserved fields are set to zero on transmission, and ignored on 
    reception.
    
    Anycast Address: 
    
    The IPv6 anycast address of the anycast group.
    
    Number of Members (N):
     
    The Number of Group members(N) field specifies how many Group 
    members are present in this Option.
    
    The Member i's IP unicast Address: 
    
    These fields are a vector of n Group Member's IPv6 unicast addresses
    , where n is the value in this Option's Number of Sources (N) field.   

        
3.2.  How to find out the "transfer point"    
      
    Two ways are provided in this document for finding out a "Transfer 
    point" for a given anycast group member.
    
    The first way is:
    
    Operators usually know the topology of their network. For each 
    anycast group member, they can find out at least one IP host node 
    or router node, anycast traffic sourced from which and destined to 
    the anycast group will arrive at that pointed anycast group member. 
    This can be done by using some operation and maintenance tools such 
    as Alcatel-Lucent's 5650 CPAM (Control Panel Assurance Manager).
     
    The second way is:
    
    Based on [RFC4292], A network administrator can know current 
    Forwarding Information Base(FIB) of each router in his 
    administration domain. By accessing "inetCidrRouteTable" Object in 
    each Router's MIB (Management Information Base), A network 
    administrator can know current FIB of each router in his domain. The
    access can be achieved by SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
    SNMP is widely supported in current routers.

    Hence we can start search the set of tranfer points from the given 
    group member. i.e. member A. 
    
    First, we find out all routers connected to each Interface of 
    member A. For each router (Router1i, i=1,...M)connected to interface
    1 of member A, we look up its FIB with the key word (Anycast 
    Address, IP Address of interface 1). the Anycast Address is done 
    longest-prefix matching with all the destination prefixes of member
    1's FIB, and the IP address of interface is matched with "next-hop"
    of FIB. If there exists a matched FIB entry, both its destination 
    prefix and next-hop match with the key word, that means IP packets 
    destined to this anycast address can arrive at member A through this
    router, and all routers connected to this router1i should be 
    examined likewise. If there is no any matched FIB entry, that means 
    IP packets destined to this anycast address cannot arrive at member 
    A through this router, next router should be tried. If there is no 
    any router  connected to member 1 can forward IP packets destined to 
    the anycast address to member 1, that means member 1 can not be 
    arrived by this anycast address.
    
    By this way, at least one leaf router can be found out to be the 
    "transfer point".     

4.  IANA Considerations
    The "Anycast Configuration Information Option" defined in this 
    document contains the "Type" field that carry values assigned from 
    IANA-managed name spaces.
    
5.  Security Considerations

    This document deals with ICMP messages in ICMPv4, ICMPv6, SNMP and 
    keeps consistent with that of [RFC792] and [RFC4433], and [RFC3411] 
    in future evolution.

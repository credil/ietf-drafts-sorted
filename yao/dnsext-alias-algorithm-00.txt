       Alias algorithm identifier assignment mechanism for DNSSEC
                draft-yao-dnsext-alias-algorithm-00.txt

Abstract

   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) has been developed to provide origin
   authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital
   signatures.  The DNSKEY, RRSIG, and DS RRs use an 8-bit number to
   identify the security algorithm being used.  More and more new
   RRTYPEs will appear in future.  This document defines an alias
   algorithm identifier assignment method for DNSSEC 8-bit algorithm
   numbers.

Internet-Draft                  alias-alg                    August 2010


1.  Introduction

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035]
   and [RFC5155] were developed to provide origin authentication and
   integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  Every
   DNSKEY, RRSIG, or DS RR contains an algorithm code number.  These
   algorithm numbers help validators to identify which cryptographic
   algorithm was used.  The algorithm numbers which can be used is
   within 256.  More RRTYPES will appear in future.  The new RRTYPE may
   use the alias algorithm number.  In order to prevent the new RRTYPE
   unaware resolvers from attempting to validate responses from the
   RRTYPE signed zones, some specification might request to allocates
   the new DNSKEY alias algorithm identifiers for the current algorithms
   used.  For example Algorithm 6, DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 is an alias for
   algorithm 3, DSA.  This is not a new algorithm, just an additional
   identifiers for the existing algorithm.  The new RRTYPE unaware
   resolvers will not know these new identifiers and treat responses
   from the new RRTYPE signed zone as insecure, otherwise the new RRTYPE
   RR will be regarded as bogus if there is no such a mechanism.  Using
   other alias algorithms for the new RRTYPE requires allocation of a
   new alias algorithm numbers.  Based on the rule of first come first
   served, the 8-bit algorithm allocation pool would soon be exhausted
   if more and more new RRTYPEs and algorithms had appeared in the DNS
   protocols.  This document defines an alias algorithm number
   assignment for the DNSSEC 8-bit algorithm numbers.

1.1.  Terminology

   All the basic terms used in this specification are defined in the
   documents [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].  DNSSEC related terms are defined
   in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and [RFC4035]


2.  Motivation

   This document tackles the problem that the new RRTYPE requests the
   alias algorithm number assignment but the algorithm number space is
   not enough.


3.  The Alias algorithm identifer assignment

   Every algorithm identifier that might be used for the new RRTYPE
   should have the alias identifier.  Based on the current algorithm
   which has been allocated, the follow algorithm should have the alias
   identifier number:

        | Diffie-Hellman    | alias-dh        | DH                |

        | URSA/SHA-1        | alias-RSASHA1   | RSASHA1           |
        | RSA/SHA-256       | alias-RSASHA256 | RSASHA256         |

        +-------------------+-----------------+-------------------+

   Other algorithm's alias identifiers will be assigned in future
   according to the future requirements.


4.  Validating the RRSIG for the new RRTYPE

   The validating resolver following this specification MUST check the
   type covered of the RRSIG before the verification.  Only when the
   validating resolver knows the RRTYPE, it can begin to verify the
   signature of the RRSIG.  Otherwise, the validating resolver MUST
   regard the RRSIG in which the type covered is unknown to the resolver
   as insecure instead of bogus.


5.  Compatiliable with the old vaildating resolver

   The old validating resolver deployed will not know the new identifier
   for the algorithm.  Zones signed according to this new specification
   MUST only use these alias algorithm identifiers for their DNSKEY RRs
   if there has the new RRTYPE in the zone.  The old resolver will treat
   the RRSIG whose algorithm identifier is unknown to them as insecure,
   otherwise the RR with the new type will be regarded as bogus if there
   is no such a mechanism.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry "DNS SECURITY ALGORITHM
   NUMBERS".  IANA is requested to assign the algorithm number to the
   following alias algorithm identifier.

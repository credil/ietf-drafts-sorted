              Cybersecurity Information Exchange Framework
                     draft-takahashi-cybex-intro-00

Abstract

   The cybersecurity information exchange framework, known as CYBEX, is
   currently undergoing its first iteration of standardization efforts
   within ITU-T.  The framework describes how cybersecurity information
   is exchanged between cybersecurity entities on a global scale and how
   the exchange is assured.  This framework is intended to facilitate
   cybersecurity entities to work together beyond national and/or
   organizational boundaries.

   Currently, ITU-T Draft Recommendation X.1500 defines the framework.
   The editors designated for the progress of the Draft Recommendation
   are (in alphabetical order): Inette Furey (DHS), Youki Kadobayashi
   (NICT), Bob Martin (MITRE), Angela Mckay (Microsoft), Stephen
   Adegbite (FIRST), Damir Rajnovic (FIRST), Gavin Reid (Cisco), Tony
   Rutkowski (Yaana), Gregg Schudel (Cisco).

   On behalf of ITU-T Q.4/17, this draft introduces the overview of
   CYBEX in the IETF.

1.  Introduction

   In the Internet, sources of threats cross borders of countries and
   even continents.  Countermeasures against these cybersecurity
   threats, however, are most frequently implemented by individual
   organizations in isolation.  Consequently, an organization in one
   country may be attacked by malware whose countermeasures are already
   known and implemented within another organization in another country.
   Such incidents occur due to the lack of sharing of information among
   organizations.  One of the biggest factors preventing organizations
   from sharing information with each other is the absence of a globally
   common format and framework for cybersecurity information exchange.
   Albeit some countries such as the United States possess domestic
   standards for approaching this problem, most other countries have no
   such standards.  Another such factor is the absence of assured
   information exchange framework, without which no organization will
   exchange information.

   To cope with this problem, ITU-T is now building an emerging standard
   - The Cybersecurity Information Exchange Framework (CYBEX).  CYBEX
   provides a globally common format and framework for assured
   cybersecurity information exchange, which will eventually minimize
   the disparity of cybersecurity information availability on a global
   scale.  Since cybersecurity information can be shared worldwide, no
   country or organization implementing CYBEX will be left behind in
   terms of its availability.  Consequently, developing countries, which
   currently have fewer resources to put towards cybersecurity, can
   become equal partners with developed countries with appropriate
   investments.  Therefore countermeasures will be implemented through
   global collaboration.  The framework will also advance the
   development of automating cybersecurity information exchange.  Most
   cybersecurity information exchange within organizations are not
   currently automated and depend largely on human intervention.  Email,
   telephone calls and even faceto- face meetings are still the primary
   method for information exchange.  The need for and reliance on human
   interaction consumes a great deal of time.  By advancing automation
   of cybersecurity information exchange, the costs (e.g., personnel
   costs) within each organization will be significantly reduced and the
   operation will be more efficient.  At the same time, human-operation-
   based mistakes such as miscommunication can be avoided; thus the
   quality of operations can be improved.

3.  Overview of Cybersecurity Information Exchange Framework

   CYBEX focuses on cybersecurity information exchange between
   cybersecurity organizations.  Cybersecurity information is
   information required for cybersecurity operations such as on a
   vulnerability, and a cybersecurity organization is an organization
   running cybersecurity operations such as CSIRTs of countries and
   private companies.  How to acquire/use cybersecurity information is
   outside the scope of CYBEX.

   Considering the cybersecurity information life cycle, we observed
   that five functional blocks are needed for CYBEX: Information
   Description, Information Discovery, Information Query, Information
   Assurance and Information Transport, as are shown in Figure 1.  The
   Information Description block structures cybersecurity information
   for exchange purposes, the Information Discovery block identifies and
   discovers cybersecurity information and entities, the Information
   Query block requests and responds with cybersecurity information, the
   Information Assurance block ensures the validity of the information,
   and Information Transport block exchanges cybersecurity information
   over networks.

                     | Information Description block |
                     +-------------------------------+
                     | Information Discovery block   |
                     +-------------------------------+
                     | Information Query block       |
                     +-------------------------------+
                     | Information Assurance block   |
                     +-------------------------------+
                     | Information Transport block   |
                     |_______________________________|

                      Five functional blocks of CYBEX

                                 Figure 1

   Each functional block consists of assorted specifications as are
   shown in Table 1.  As can be seen, one important characteristics of
   CYBEX is that this de jure standard is based on current de facto
   standards, and that by creating CYBEX in cooperation with the
   creators of each de facto standards we can increase the utility and
   compatibility of CYBEX with these standards, so users will be able to
   use CYBEX seamlessly with available products, making CYBEX more
   practical and deployable.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   This paper introduced CYBEX, a new cybersecurity standard that will
   be finalized in December 2010.  CYBEX provides a framework for
   assured cybersecurity information exchange between cybersecurity
   entities and minimizes the disparity of cybersecurity information
   availability among cybersecurity entities.  The challenge is finding
   a means of permitting wide usage of CYBEX.  Without global and
   widespread usage, CYBEX will not be able to provide its true value or
   contribute to cybersecurity.  In order to advance cybersecurity, the
   effectiveness of CYBEX needs to be globally and widely recognized.

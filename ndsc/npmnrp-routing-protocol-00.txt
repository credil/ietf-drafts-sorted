   1. Introduction 
      
     The inspiration of this routing protocol comes from the natural 
     water flow, which is a phenomenon of potential energy driven. Water 
     flows through all feasible channels from high potential site to low 
     potential site. If in every router all feasible next-hops for one 
     certain destination can be found, then all the packets to that 
     destination can be transferred in many paths. 
      
     This routing protocol obeys the Internet philosophy of "hop-by-hop 
     routing paradigm" and enhances it with "multiple feasible next-hops". 
     That means protocol try to calculate multiple next-hops for each node 
     and not find multi-path end to end. The forwarding direction of 
     packets is constrained by routing metrics. Different packets to one 
     destination can be distributed into multiple next-hops in parallel, 
     which can make full use of all feasible next hops, so that the link 
     utility ratio is globally even. 
      
     Compared with nature water flow phenomenon, the routing protocol 
     defines a routing metric named as node potential in communication 
     networks. Node potential is a parameter to measure the ability to 
     transfer packets from one certain node to its destination. So the 
     routing protocol is named as node potential oriented multiple next-
     hops routing protocol (NP-MNRP in short). 
      
     NP-MNRP is designed to calculate multiple next-hops for one 
     destination in network without knowing the globally topology

     information. Distance vector routing protocols such as RIP and BGP 
     are used for reference. NP-MNRP protocol is consisted of network 
     reachable information advertisement process and node potential 
     calculation process. 
     But unlike those protocols, NP-MNRP ensures the following properties: 
     (1) Multiple feasible next-hops for each destination. When node 
     finds the main next-hop unreachable, it chooses one from the backup 
     next-hops to forward the packet. 
     (2) Accelerate the convergence speed and reduce route flap. 
     Compared with the single shortest-path routing, NP-MNRP can 
     effectively avoid congestion and shorten protection switching delay. 
     The path establishment and maintenance can be accomplished by routing 
     information advertisement mechanism between peers. The control 
     overhead of the protocol is smaller than other multi-path routing 
     protocols. When kinds of concurrent failures occur in network, NP-
     MNRP can provide more feasible next-hops and high recovery 
     probability. 
      
   2. Terminology 
      
     Carrier Network: The network in which the nodes run Node Potential 
     Oriented Routing Protocol. 
      
     User Network: The network that needs message transfer service 
     provided by Carrier Network. 
      
     Boundary Node: According to the location of nodes in the carrier 
     network, the nodes are divided into boundary nodes and intermediate 
     nodes. Boundary nodes are also divided into two categories according 
     to the flow direction. In terms of user network flow, the node 
     through which flow into the carrier network, is called ingress node; 
     the node through which flow out of the carrier network, is called 
     egress node. 
      
     Intermediate Node: The other nodes in the carrier network except the 
     Boundary Nodes. 
      
     Potential Reference Node: The egress nodes which the user network 
     traffic flows out from the carrier network. In the route calculation 
     process, these nodes will be set its node potential value to zero and 
     be act as reference node in node potential computation procedure. 
     Network Layer Diagram: The diagram that describes the distribution 
     of the layer value of every node relative to a destination node. 
      
     Node Potential: A metric that measures the accessibility from a node 
     to zero potential nodes in the carrier network. 
      
     Router ID: A 32-bit number assigned to each router running the NP-
     MNRP protocol. This number uniquely identifies the router in the 

  NDSC                     Expires July 28, 2010              [Page 3] 
                                      
  Internet Draft          The NPMNRP Routing Protocol          July 2010 
   
   
     carrier network. One algorithm for Router ID assignment is to choose 
     the largest or smallest IP address assigned to the router. 
      
     Set of Available Next-hops: The set of available next-hops of node i 
     when it sends packets to the destination node j, which is denoted as 
     A (i,j). 
      
     Network Layer Reachable Information Flood Advertisement Packet 
     (NLRI-FAP): The packet is used to advertise the information of 
     binding relations between network prefix and egress nodes to its 
     neighbors. IP address and subnet mask of its binding user network are 
     included in this packet. 
      
     Network Layer Reachable Information Specific Request Packet (NLRI-
     SRP): The packet is used to request a particular egress node for 
     certain prefix binding relationship information. IP address and 
     subnet mask of user network whose binding relationship needs to know 
     are included in this packet. 
      
     Network Layer Reachable Information Direction Answer Packet (NLRI-
     DAP): The packet is used to respond to a Network Layer Reachable 
     Information Specific Request Packet. IP address and subnet mask of 
     user network and its bound router ID are included in this packet. 
     Network Layer Graph Construction Trigger Packet (NLG-CTP): The 
     packet is used to trigger the building of network layer diagram. 
      
     Network Layer Graph Information Advertisement Packet (NLG-IAP): The 
     packet is used to advertise its layer information relative to one 
     egress node to its neighbors. The egress node ID and its layer value 
     relative to this egress node is included in this packet. 
      
     Network Layer Graph Routing Request Packet (NLG-RRP): The packet is 
     used to request the neighbors to update it's layer information relative
     to one egress node and this egress node ID is included in this packet. 
      
     Network Layer Graph Request Update Packet (NLG-RUP): The packet is 
     used to inform the nodes which are on a particular layer relative to 
     one destination node, to rebuild their layer information and that 
     layer value is included in this packet. 
      
     Link State Detect Packet (Detect): The packet is used to detect the 
     link status between itself and its neighbors. The sequence number of 
     this packet and the period for sending Detect are included in this 
     packet. 
      
     REPLY Packet (REPLY): The packet is used to respond to the Detect 
     indicating the good link state. The sequence number of this packet 
     and the period for sending Detect are included in this packet.

     3.1.LFBs Network prefix information advertisement 
   
     Because NP-MNRP protocol is designed as an IGP inside the autonomous 
     system, it should route transit network traffic and local network 
     traffic. The network IP prefix is divided into two parts: the IP 
     prefix information of transit network and the IP prefix information 
     of the network running NP-MNRP protocol own. 
      
     In view of NP-MNRP protocol, network is divided into user network 
     and carrier network, as shown in the figure 1. User network is 
     abbreviated as UN and carrier network is abbreviated as CN. Each node 
     in CN will run NP-MNRP protocol to establish multiple next-hops 
     routing information base. Otherwise, it is not necessary for nodes in 
     UN to run NP-MNRP protocol.

     The nodes in UN will finish local communication and transmit the 
     network traffic whose destinations are not in the user network itself 
     to the Carrier network. The network prefix of UN is named as Network 
     Layer reachable information. Carrier network mainly transfer transit 
     traffic for UN. The network prefix of CN is treated as network 
     topology information and will be advertised by potential calculation 
     process. The boundary nodes of CN are also named as egress nodes. 
     They advertise network layer reachable information to neighbor nodes 
     periodically and initiate node potential calculation procedure for 
     itself.

     This advertisement method separates the information of CN topology 
     from the network layer reachable information and advertises them in 
     different manner. The advertisement of topology information is 
     independent with network layer reachable information. From this way, 
     the flexibility of routing information distribution can be enhanced. 
      
     3.1.2 Network layer reachable information advertisement 
      
          Network layer reachable information that means the user network 
     prefix is advertised through NLRI-FAP, NLRI-SRP and NLRI-DAP packets. 
     The boundary nodes in CN are responsible for advertising user network 
     reachable information, as shown in the figure 2.

       The boundary nodes in CN advertise network layer reachable 
     information to neighbor nodes periodically through NLRI-FAP. Once 
     receiving the NLRI-FAP, the nodes in CN extract network prefix 
     information from packets and add them to the network layer reachable 
     information database of their own. 
      
       When the nodes in CN don't know user network prefix, these nodes 
     will act as inquirers and send NLRI-SRP to query other nodes and set 
     a query timer. When a node receives the NLRI-SRP, and the network 
     prefix information or attached router information is in its database, 
     it responses to inquirer with a NLRI-DAP packet. Otherwise, it sends 
     the NLRI-SRP packet to its neighbors except for the enquirers. This 
     process will continue until the inquirer get an response from other 
     nodes or such query timer is timed out. 
      
     When bound to the egress node (relative information is absent in 
     network layer reachable information database of the node), the node 
     send NLRI-SRP flooding to inquirer, called enquirers.  
      
     3.2.Neighbor Node Discovery and Adjacency establishment 
      
     When a new node joins in the network, other nodes discover it and 
     initialize their local routing tables as the following steps: 
     (1): Broadcast a Detect packet and a NLG-CTP packet. This node sets 
     the sequence number of Detect with 0.The Detect will be sent 
     periodically by defaulted period set in the protocol;  
      
     (2): When other nodes receive a Detect packet or a NLG-CTP packet, 
     they operate as follows: 
     (a) If the received Detect message is comed from an unknown node and 
     sequence number is  equal to 0, the receivers know that a new node add to 
     network and add it to their neighbor node database and record 
     sequence number of  the Detect message; 
     (b) Reply to the unknown node with an REPLY packet; Send a NLG-IAP 
     packet which contains all egress nodes information in the database. 
     (c) According to the computation rules of node potential, they 
     compute layer value and potential value relative to the egress node. 
      
     (3): When received a REPLY packet and a NLG-IAP packet, the new node 
     operates as follows: 
     (a) Adds the neighbor node to routing information database; 
     (b) According to NLG-IAP, it calculates its own layer value as 
     following formula: 
     L(i,i)=0; 
     L(i,j)=min[L(k,j)]+1, for each k blongs to Ki, j blongs to N, and 
     k,j are not equal to i. 
     L(i,j) is the layer value of node i reference to egress node j, N is

     (c) Based on the layer values of its neighbors, bandwidth and its 
     own layer value, the new node computes node potential value of its

      3.3. Calculation of node potential value 
      
     3.3.1 Definition of node potential value 
      
     NP-MNRP defines node potential value as a mixed metric of hop count 
     and bandwidth. Hop count metric records the number of routers which a 
     packet passes through and each router is recorded as one hop. The 
     actual link bandwidth is allocated\configured by router in the 
     network initialization. 
      
     3.3.2 Protocol packets sending and processing 
      
     3.3.2.1 Network Layer Graph Routing Request Packet processing 
      
     Network Layer Graph Routing Request Packet (NLG-RRP) has two 
     different types. One type is all nodes layer information request 
     packet which will request the receiver to send layer information of 
     all nodes. The other is partial nodes layer information request 
     packet which will request the receiver to send layer information of 
     the specified nodes. 
      
     The NLG-RRP will be used in the following conditions: 
     Condition 1: When a new node is attached to the network, all nodes 
     layer information request packet will be sent to its neighbors. 
      
     Condition 2: When the node want to get some certain network prefix 
     information from its neighbors, partial nodes layer information 
     request packet will be sent. 
      
     Once receiving a NLG-RRP packet, each node should process as the 
     following steps: 
     (a): Firstly, the type of the packet will be verified whether or not 
     it is a correct NLG-RRP packet. 
     (b): When NLG-RRP is the all nodes layer information request packets, 
     it sends its own layer information relative to the other nodes to the 
     request node. 
     (c): When NLG-RRP is the partial nodes layer information request 
     packet, it sends its own layer information relative to the 
     destination node in the packet to the query node. 
      
     3.3.2.2 Network Layer Graph Information Advertisement Packet sending 
      
          Network Layer Graph Information Advertisement Packet (NLG-IAP) 
     is broadcasted to its neighbors in the following cases: 
     Case 1: Each layer value of every noed is specified after the network 
     layer graph has been divided. 
  NDSC                     Expires July 28, 2010              [Page 8] 
                                      
  Internet Draft          The NPMNRP Routing Protocol          July 2010 
   
   
     Case 2: When layer information of any node is changed, which may be 
     caused by the change of layer values of some routers when they 
     received NLG-FAP or some new nodes are added to the network. 
     Case 3: A NLG-RRP packet is received and the layer value of receiver 
     reference to certain egress node is changed. 
     The processing rules of NLG-IAP are described in section 3.5. 
      
     3.3.3 Calculation of the node potential value 
      
     In NP-MNRP, the node potential value is a mixed metric, including 
     hop count and actual link bandwidth. Each egress node activates its 
     neighbors to build Network Layer graph by sending a NLG-CTP packet to 
     neighbors. Calculated as follows: 
     (1) In the algorithm initialization, egress node assigns its layer 
     value as 0, and then sends a NLG-CTP packet to its neighbors, which 
     contains the actual link bandwidth. 
     (2) The neighbor node that received a NLG-CTP packet from the 0-
     layer node sets itself as 1-layer, and generates a NLG-CTP packet and 
     sends to its neighbors. And so on. 
     (3) Repeat the above step (2) until the nodes whose layer value are 
     smaller than f-layer which have been determined. 
     (4) After the f-layer has been constructed completely, each node in 
     f-layer knows that it is in f-layer and knows that which neighbors 
     are in f-1 layer. The nodes in f-1layer know that which ones are in f 
     layer, which ones are in f-1 layer, and which ones are in f-2 layer. 
     (5) Supposed f-layer has been constructed, and the algorithm has not 
     been terminated, then the construction of the f +1 layer will begins. 
     The nodes in f-layer will send a NLG-CTP packet to its neighbors. 
     (6) When all the nodes are traveled, algorithm ends. 
      
     All nodes in the network not only are aware of their own layer value 
     but also know the layer values of their neighbors and the actual bandwidth 
     between themselves. 
      
     Next each node calculates the potential value as follows: 
     (1) 0-layer nodes directly define their own potential value as 0; 
     (2) Each node of the other layers chooses the largest potential 
     value node among its neighbors in the same and lower layers as its 
     reference node for defining potential value, then defines its 
     potential values as  potential value of the reference node  plus one and 
     potential value of its neighbors which are equal to their layer value. 
     (3) When each otential value of the neighbors is defined, the node 
     will choose the neighbor nodes whose potential values are less than 
     its own as feasible next-hops of itself. 
      
      3.4. network event sensing 
      
     NP-MNRP protocol can sense events such as new node add to network or 
     neighbor node is down. The node senses these events through sending 
     out Detect packet and receiving REPLY packet periodically.

     3.4.1 Message sending and processing 
      
          Each NP-MNRP node broadcasts periodically Detect packet. When a 
     Detect packet is received, the receiver sends a REPLY packet to the 
     sender. The detailed steps are as follows: 
     Step1: Each node broadcasts periodically a Detect packet. Detect packet
     carries a sequence number and  periodic interval. 
      
     Step2: When a Detect packet is received, its sequence number is 
     compared with the expected sequence number for this neighbor. Then 
     the receiver sends a REPLY packet to the sender and evaluates inverse 
     link quality according to the sequence number.  
      
     Step3: When a Reply packet is received, its sequence number should 
     be equaled to the sequence number of the Detect packet. 
     Then the receiver evaluates link quality according to the 
     sequence number and the use of sent/receive message time. 
      
     3.4.2 Forward direction link sensing 
      
          A(Ti) represents the mean interval from node i sending out 
     Detect packet to receiving REPLY packet. FA (Ti) represents the 
     latest mean interval time. Node i adjust the period of sending out 
     Detect packet according to the following rules: 
     (1) If FA(Ti) < A(Ti), it means that the link quality is stable. At 
     this period, when three continuous Detect packets are all low, then 
     increase the Detect interval; 
      
     (2) If FA(Ti) > A(Ti), it means that the link quality is unsteady or 
     become bad. At this period, when three continuous Detect packets are 
     all high, then reduce Detect interval; 
      
     (3) When a Detect packet is sent out but a REPLY packet is not 
     received in the 2*FA(Ti) time, the node will reduce the period at 
     half, then continue sending out the next sequence number Detect 
     packet. If a REPLY packet still not received, the node insulates that 
     node and thinks link breakdown or link congestion. 
      
     (4) The isolate node will not be used as the next-hop to forwarding 
     packets. The processing node should continue sending Detect packet 
     and adjust strategy according to the following conditions: 
     (a) If three continuous REPLY packets received, then the node 
     deletes the isolate node and uses nodes which reply the REPLY packet 
     as the next-hops to forwarding packets. 
     (b) If no packet is received after 6 Detect intervals, so that node 
     is thought to be breakdown, unable to send Detect packet again. Waiting 
     for 6 Detect intervals, and if have not received a Detect packet 
     from other node,and judge the node breakdown and delete all the routing 
     information received form its neighbors;

  Internet Draft          The NPMNRP Routing Protocol          July 2010 
   
   
     (c) If the node can receive a Detect packet or a REPLY packet which 
     is send out from isolate node, and then it will continue sending a 
     Detect packet until the isolate node recovery or judge node breakdown. 
      
     3.4.3 Inverse link sensing 
      
     Each node broadcasts periodically Detect packet. Every Detect 
     carries a sequence number and the interval. 
      
     When a Detect packet is received, compared sequence number with the 
     next expected sequence number for this neighbor, if the sequence 
     number of the received Detect packet is higher than the expected, 
     then one or more Detect packets have been missed. If the sequence 
     number is lower, then this neighbor decrease the Detect interval, and 
     part of the history must be undone. 
      
     From the history of received Detect packets, a node computes an 
     estimate of the inverse link quality. 
      
      3.5. Update of the node potential 
      
     3.5.1 Update of network layer value 
      
     As the set of next-hop is empty, the node will trigger update about 
     the layer value through the following operations: 
     (1) Firstly, the node will check whether the set of its neighbors on 
     the same layer is empty. If is not, it will change itself layer value 
     and generate NLG-IAP packets that are sent to its neighbors. 
     (2) If the set is empty, then the node will perform the following 
     steps: 
     (a) Flooding NLG-RUP packets, whose layer value will be revised to 
     the old layer value minus 2, however, if old layer value minus 2 is 
     less than 0, the value is set to 0. What's more, all information 
     about this egress node will be deleted. 
     (b) The node received a NLG-RUP packet will check if it has ever 
     received this message. If having received such message, the packet 
     will be ignored, otherwise view the layer value in this packet. If 
     the value is greater than the value of its own, the node will discard 
     the packet, otherwise, go on flooding NLG-RUP packets to its 
     neighbors and delete all information about this egress node. 
     (c) If the layer value in the packet is equal to its own, the node 
     will stop flooding to send NLG-RUP and send a NLG-CTP packet about 
     the egress node. 
     (d) Neighbor node received a NLG-CTP packet will calculate its new 
     layer value. If new value is same with the original, the node stops 
     sending NLG-CTP packets and the layer value update algorithm will 
     terminate.

  Internet Draft          The NPMNRP Routing Protocol          July 2010 
   
   
     The potential value of the nodes will be updated in the following 
     conditions. 
     (1) Potential value update caused by NLG-IAP packet. 
     The main content of a NLG-IAP packet are layer information of a node 
     relative to the egress node in the network. The node adjusts its 
     potential value according to the NLG-IAP packets received from its 
     neighbors. Specific updated as follows: 
      
     (a) NLG-IAP packet generation 
     When the node finds its layer information relative to one certain 
     egress node changed, the new layer information relative to all egress 
     nodes will be written into its generated NLG-IAP packet. 
      
     (b) NLG-IAP to send 
     The node will broadcast its generated NLG-IAP packets to its 
     neighbors, and then wait for confirmation from its neighbors. When 
     the node receives REPLY pockets with sequence number 0XFFFF from its 
     neighbors, this update ends. 
      
     (c) When the node received the NLG-IAP packet, it performs the 
     following steps: 
     Firstly, this node will verify NLG-IAP packet. If the packet is 
     validated, it sends a REPLY packet with sequence number 0XFFFF to 
     source node of NLG-IAP packet. 
     Secondly, this node will extract layer information from the NLG-IAP 
     packet supposing a received routing entries includes RUIi =< RouterID, 
     EgressnodeID, Layi> and the corresponding routing entry stored in the 
     database is RUI'i =< RouterID, EgressnodeID, Lay'i>, when one of the 
     following three cases are met, the node update its own routing table 
     according to the information received. 
     Case 1: If the EgressnodeID included in the received routing table 
     entry dose not exist in its own routing table, the router will add it 
     and send a NLG-RRP packet about the destination address of the 
     network to its neighbors. After received NLG-IAP packets, it will 
     calculate its layer value relative to this egress node according to 
     formula in 3.2, and get layer values of it's neighbors, then define the 
     potential value of neighbor node reference to this destination node. 
     Case 2: If the EgressnodeID included in the received routing table 
     entry exists in its own routing table and Lay'i < Layi, the router 
     will adjust the layer values of its neighbors and potential value. If the 
     potential value of neighbor is greater than its own and the neighbor 
     node is just in its own next-hop collection, the router will remove 
     the node from next-hop collection, if not, do nothing. 
     Case 3: If Layi < Lay, then the router will adjust the layer value of
     neighbor node and potential value. If the potential value of neighbor
     is less than its own and the neighbor node is not in its own 
     next-hop collection, then the router will add it into the next-hop 
     collection, if exist, just do nothing. However the router will not 
     adjust its layer value and potential value in this case.

     (2) Potential value update caused by the change of layer value 
      
     When the layer value reference to a particular destination 
     node changes, firstly it will modify layer value of itself and its 
     neighbors. Then the new potential value will be calculated according 
     to update strategy. 
      
   4. Routing information base 
      
     Each routing node maintains the Routing Information Base to forward 
     IP packets. NP-MNRP protocol can calculate multi-nexthop routing 
     information in the network. The route computation process descried in 
     Section 3 will record all the feasible next-hops for every 
     destination. The multi-nexthop routing entry is composed of three 
     fields. 
      
     The first field is named as destination IP address field. 
      
     The second field is named as the destination IP address mask filed. 
     The first and second fields are 32-bit numbers which define network 
     destination information of each routing entry. And the route 
     information base is indexed by the first and second field. 
      
     The third field is named as feasible nexthop filed, whose form is a 
     couple of next-hop IP address value and node potential difference 
     value. The next-hop IP address is IP address of the neighbor node who 
     will act as a feasible next-hop for this routing node to forward IP 
     packets to the network destination. Compared with the single next-hop 
     routing information, the number of feasible next-hop filed in a 
     multi-nexthop routing entry may be a value bigger than one. 
      
     The routing node will gain more agility in IP packet forwarding 
     procedure. It can choose forward all the packets to one best next-hop 
     and use other feasible next-hop entries as backup entries. Through 
     this way, the network availability will be improved in the scene that 
     network failure or mal-function occurs frequently. It can also choose 
     forward all the IP packets to all feasible next-hop entries. In this 
     manner, this routing node can assign each next-hop a traffic ratio 
     for each destination. All the packets will be forwarded to variable 
     next-hop pro rata. This will make the network resource utilization 
     more evenness and avoid network congestion in some ways. 
      
   5. NP-MNRP packets format 
      
     The NP-MNRP protocol runs directly over the IP network layer. Before 
     any packet format is described, the details of the NP-MNRP 
     encapsulation are explained. 
      
      5.1. Encapsulation of NP-MNRP packets 
      
  NDSC                     Expires July 28, 2010              [Page 13] 
                                      
  Internet Draft          The NPMNRP Routing Protocol          July 2010 
   
   
     NP-MNRP runs directly over the Internet Protocol's network layer. 
     Therefore, NP-MNRP packets are encapsulated solely by IP and local 
     data-link headers. NP-MNRP does not define a way to fragment its 
     protocol packets, and depends on IP fragmentation when transmitting 
     packets larger than the network MTU.  
      
     NP-MNRP uses IP protocol number 99. Routing protocol packets are 
     sent with IP precedence set to inter-network Control. NP-MNRP 
     protocol packets should be given precedence over regular IP data 
     traffic, in both sending and receiving. 
      
      5.2. Packet format 
      
     There are nine distinct NP-MNRP packet types. All NP-MNRP packet 
     types begin with a standard 20 byte header. This header is described 
     first. Each packet type is then described in a succeeding section. In 
     these sections each packet's division into fields is displayed, and 
     then the field definitions are enumerated. 
      
     5.2.1 The NP-MNRP packet header 
      
     Every NP-MNRP packet starts with a standard 20 byte header. This 
     header contains all the information necessary to determine whether 
     the packet should be accepted for further processing. This 
     determination is described in Section 5.2 of the specification.

     authentication field. If the length of the package is less than 16-
     bit, 0 byte WOULD be added before the checksum byte. 
      
     Authentication Type 
     Identify the authentication procedure used for the packet. 
     Authentication is discussed in the specification. 
      
     Authentication Info 
     64-bit authentication information field depends on the chosen 
     authentication type, to carry identification information such as 
     identity authentication. 
      
     5.2.2 Various types of protocol packets 
      
     NP-MNRP protocol packets have total of 9 species. 
      
     5.2.2.1 Network Layer Reachable Information Flood Advertisement 
     Packet, NLRI-FAP 
      
     NLRI-FAP packet is NP-MNRP packet type 1.The packet is send by an 
     egress node in the carrier network and is used to advertise the user 
     network prefix information which is bound to this node. The node that 
     received this packet WOULD consider this egress node is reachable and 
     the user network which is bound to this node is reachable too.

     5.2.2.2 Network Layer Reachable Information Specific Request Packet, 
     NLRI-SRP 
      
     NLRI-SRP packet is NP-MNRP packet type 2.This packet is used by the 
     node in the carrier network to request the network layer reachable 
     information. When the node doses not know which egress node, one 
     network prefix is bound to, the NLRI-SRP packet is sent. 
      
     If the IP address and the subnet mask of the network 1 is all 0, all 
     the network prefixes WOULD be requested, and usually this request is 
     sent by a node which just joins into the carrier network.

     5.2.2.3 Network Layer Reachable Information Direction Answer Packet, 
     NLRI-DAP 
      
     NLRI-DAP packet is NP-MNRP packet type 3. The node that receives the 
     NLRI-SRP packet WOULD check its information database to seek for the 
     corresponding binding relationship. If the binding relationship 
     exists in its own information database, it WOULD send NLRI-DAP packet 
     to the requesting node, if not, it WOULD send NLRI-SRP packets to its 
     all neighbor nodes except for the requesting node. 
      
     If a node who sends the NLRI-SRP packets at the same time receives 
     more than one packet about the same IP prefix binding relationship, 
     and these packets are conflictive, it WOULD go on sending NLRI-SRP 
     packets, until the egress node which the network prefix is bound to 
     answers the request.

     Sequence number 
     The sequence number in this packet is the sequence number of the 
     Detect message, and it is an increasing positive integer. 
      
     Period 
     The period in this packet is the interval time between this to the 
     last one. 
      
     5.2.2.9 REPLY Message Packet, REPLY 
      
     REPLY packet is NP-MNRP packet type 9. The node that received a 
     detect packet will send a reply packet to the sender, which can 
     evaluate the reverse link quality according to this packet. The 
     sequence number in this packet denotes it is the reply to the Detect 
     message that has the corresponding sequence number. If the number is 
     full-1, it means the packet is confirmation message to a NLG-IAP 
     message.

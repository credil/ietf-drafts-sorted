1. Introduction 

   IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) was originally designed 
   according to wired shared-medium Ethernet network model.  It has 
   several versions (IGMPv1/v2/v3 [1][2][3], MLDv1/v2[4][5]) which are

   evolved with new features added to meet the increased requirements 
   but they all keep on the original shared Ethernet model. 

   With the emerging of wireless network and techniques, mobile or 
   wireless IP multicast sees their potentiality to be deployed to 
   enable efficient delivery of mobile video service.  Because the 
   networking conditions in these scenarios are different from that of 
   fixed Ethernet, e.g. with possibly higher packet loss rate, current 
   versions of IGMP and MLD are somewhat inadequate and there is the 
   demand that IGMP/MLD protocol should be enhanced to meet the 
   reliability requirements in these scenarios [8][9]. 

   This memo introduces the reliability enhancement of group management 
   protocol on wireless or mobile IP networks.  The reliability is 
   enhanced by providing acknowledgement for group join request 
   messages.  The document is arranged as follows: section 2 discusses 
   the general issues including the requirements and basic mechanism.  
   Section 3 describes the protocol behavior on both the host and the 
   router part.  Section 4 defines the message format and Section 5 
   discusses interoperability issue with the earlier deployed versions.  
   Section 6 defines the timer and counter parameters.  The state-
   machine of the new protocol will be included in the later version of 
   draft. 

    

2. General Discussions 

   Wireless network has the characteristics that its packet delivery is 
   sometimes unreliable (e.g. with much higher packet loss rate) due to 
   its unstable media transmission conditions.  And in some mobile IP 
   multicast designs, the IGMP/MLD messages have to be sent from 
   foreign network to home network.  In these two cases, IGMP and MLD 
   reports are prone to loss due to network conditions degradation or 
   long distance travel. 

   IGMP and MLD (except for IGMPv1) define a retransmission parameter 
   [Robustness Variable] which determines the transmission times the 
   report was sent.  It improves the reliability to some degree but is 
   inadequate for several reasons.  First, because the value for the 
   variable is constant, if the network is in good condition, the 
   packet retransmission is a waste of resources.  Secondly, on lossy 
   network, even multiple packets are sent, all of them may be lost, 
   thus robustness can not be guaranteed.  Finally, if the link 
   condition changes from time to time, or if the host moves from one

   network or link to another, it is difficult to arrange a reasonable 
   value for the parameter. 

   This memo suggests adopting acknowledgement-retransmission mechanism, 
   which is commonly deployed in today's protocol design, to enhance 
   the reliable delivery of IGMP/MLD join report.  Its basic protocol 
   behavior is direct and simple.  IGMP or MLD host after sending a 
   join report, starts a retransmission timer and waits for the 
   acknowledgement (ACK) message from the router.  If the ACK is not 
   received when the timer expires, another report is retransmitted.  
   The protocol should also use a parameter [RETRANS_COUNT]), to limit 
   the maximum retransmission times when make the joining. 

   The acknowledgment mechanism was proposed in an earlier work [8] 
   which suggests providing feedback for the group join messages 
   instead of periodical Queries on point-to-point network.  Draft [10] 
   discusses another feedback method when group join can not be 
   processed normally by the router.  It can be seen that 
   acknowledgment to join is not a rare thought related to group 
   management protocol.  Retransmission enhanced with acknowledgment is 
   more efficient because if a report is successfully acknowledged, its 
   retransmission is not needed. 

    

3. Protocol Behavior Description  

   The reliable group management protocol does not change the general 
   protocol behavior prescribed in previous IGMP and MLD.  The 
   difference lies in the use of ACK message, which are sent in 
   response to the join report that require acknowledgement. 

   There are two kinds of report generated by an IGMP/MLD host - 
   unsolicited reports when host initially join a group to request 
   reception of the multicast data, and passive report in response to 
   router's Queries to refresh the state database of the host on the 
   router.  Because unsolicited reports have direct effects on user' 
   experience, their reliability requirements are stronger than those 
   of the passive ones.  It is suggested that only unsolicited report 
   is acknowledged by the router, while the passive report is not 
   acknowledged because in IGMP/MLD they are generated continuously, 
   the acknowledgement on them will produce too many extra packets on 
   the network. 

   For some mobile IP multicast networks, IGMP/MLD reports, which may 
   be generated by a host or a router, have to travel from foreign

   network to home network.  These reports can be acknowledged by the 
   router on the home network to improve reliability. 

   To differentiate whether an IGMP/MLD report should be acknowledged 
   or not, an ACK flag can be set in the report message.  The router on 
   receiving a report message decides whether to feedback an ACK 
   message or not according to this flag, which can be set in the 
   reserved field of an IGMP/MLD message.  In this memo the extension 
   is made based on IGMPv2 and MLDv2 messages. 

   For unacknowledged reports, the process of the host and router on 
   them are the same as the fixed IGMP/MLD protocols.  That is, the 
   host sends the report without the ACK flag, for [Robustness Variable] 
   times.  The router will not generate ACK message in reception of 
   this report. 

   The definition of the timers and counters aforementioned will be 
   described later in this memo.  Their names will appear in square 
   brackets. 

3.1. Group Member Operations 

   Host actively sends IGMP or MLD Report to the attached router when 
   it wants to join a multicast group or a source-group channel, which 
   will be confirmed by the router by an IGMP or MLD Acknowledgment 
   (ACK) message.  If after an [RETRANS_INTERVAL] interval the ACK is 
   not received, the host should resend the report and wait another ACK.  
   Host stops its retransmission attempt as the retransmission number 
   reach the [RETRANS_COUNT]. 

   There is the possibility that the ACK message for a report is sent 
   by a router but lost.  Because in this case the router will forward 
   the multicast traffic after the acknowledgment, the multicast data 
   received by the host can be used to make the acknowledgement by the 
   host.  Thus if a host receives the multicast data it asks for, it 
   will stop retransmitting report even though ACK message is not 
   received. 

   The host also sends reports on receiving the Queries from the router.  
   In this case, it does not wait for the acknowledgement of the router 
   and the host's behavior is the same as those defined in its fixed 
   IGMP/MLD versions.  

   When IGMP/MLD reports have to travel from one part of the network to 
   another, they can also be acknowledged because they have more 
   possibilities of being lost.  These reports could be produced by

   either a host or router, depending on the arrangement of a mobile 
   network.  The acknowledgement and retransmission method for the 
   report is the same as that of unsolicited report. 

3.2. Multicast Router Operations 

   The router according to the ACK flag decides whether to provide 
   acknowledgment to the received report.  The destination address of 
   ACK packet is set to the unicast address of the host to be 
   acknowledged.  The router after acknowledging the unsolicited report 
   will create the state for this receiver and start to send the 
   multicast data toward the receiver. 

   In some situations the router has already created states for the 
   report sender (which may be an attached host or a remote 
   host/router).  When the router still receive the sender's report 
   requesting ACK, it will still provide acknowledgement to the sender. 

   Other protocol behavior on the router should be same as the those 
   described in fixed network IGMPv3 and MLDv2 versions [3][5]. 

    

4. Message Format 

   For convenience of illustration, we refer to the IGMP/MLD defined in 
   this version as Wireless IGMP/WMLD (WIGMP/WMLD) protocols, whose 
   suggested message formats are constructed based on IGMPv3/MLDv2 
   messages.  The differences between the message sets of WIGMP/WMLD 
   and IGMPv3/MLDv2 are that WIGMP/WMLD report uses an additional flag 
   to indicate whether the message is to be acknowledged or not, and an 
   ACK message is introduced, as shown in figure 1 to 6.  The formats 
   of Queries are the same as those of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 messages, which 
   are not illustrated here.  For WIGMP the length of multicast group 
   address and source address should be 32 bits and for WMLD their 
   length should be 128 bits. 

   For the quick processing by the router, this memo recommends an 
   unsolicited WIGMP/WMLD report not to be merged with other reports 
   when generated on an interface, thus only *one* Group Record is 
   present in its message.  A new 'flag' field is introduced in the 
   header to denote ACK flag, as respectively shown in Figure 1, and 2.

   The format of the Group Records and Multicast Address Record in 
   figure 1, 2, 3 and 4 are defined in [3] and [5].  

   The ACK message for WIGMP and WMLD are newly introduced.  It is 
   unicast sent from a multicast router to a host.  There are two 
   options to define ACK messages: one is to reuse current Report 
   message format with a flag for identification for ACK message, the 
   other is to define a new message type.  The former has the advantage 
   that it requires no IANA assignment and is more compatible with 
   original IGMP and MLD protocols.  The definition of the two message 
   type are shown in figure 5 and 6

5. Interoperability Considerations 

   Only interoperability of WIGMP is discussed and that for WMLD is 
   similar thus is omitted for simplicity.

   If a WIGMP/WMLD host connects to an IGMPv3/MLDv2 router, the router 
   can not process the ACK flag in the report and might do not provide 
   acknowledgement to the report.  To enable communication in this 
   scenario, if the router can not process the report and if the host 
   recognizes the version from the Queries, the host should send report 
   without ACK flag and do not wait for the ACK message.  The 
   retransmission times could be identified by the [ROBUST_VARIABLE] 
   parameter.  The communication should be done without the 
   confirmation of reports, which is the same as IGMPv3/MLD protocols. 

   If a WIGMP/WMLD router faces an IGMPv3/MLDv2 host, the router need 
   not provide feedback on the host's unsolicited report.  The WIGMP 
   router must behave as the version used by the host and it must not 
   acknowledge the report sent by the host.   

   The interaction with PIM protocol is that the interface with PIM 
   protocol could be created by the router before or after the ACK-
   flagged report is acknowledged according to the implementation 
   considerations. 

   For an IGMP/MLD snooping switch, to simplify the processing, the 
   forwarding port is required to be created by snooping the Report 
   message instead of by snooping the ACK message.  If the report is 
   acknowledged by the ACK message or the multicast traffic, the switch 
   will normally forward the multicast traffic on this port.  Otherwise 
   if the forwarding port was created without the successful 
   acknowledgement of the router, the switch will timeout this port 
   because it could not receive multicast traffic from the router.  
   Thus no special processing is required on the switch when IGMP/MLD 
   is enhanced with ACK mechanism.  

   For IGMP/MLD proxy, the processing is the same as the requirements 
   given by WIGMP/WMLD host and router.  The host interface could send 
   a report with or without an ACK flag, and the router interface 
   decide to acknowledge the report message or not according to the ACK 
   flag. 

    

6. New Parameters Defined 

   [RETRANS_INTERVAL]: The time interval between repetitions of a 
   host's report of membership in a group when ACK flag is set.  For a 
   unsolicited report, this interval could be set to the same value as 
   [Unsolicited Report Interval] defined in IGMPv3 and MLDv2, whose 
   default value is 1 second.

Internet-Draft          Wireless IGMP and MLD               March 2010 
    

   [RETRANS_COUNT]: The maximum retransmission number of ACK-flagged 
   report.  When the retransmission number reaches this value, the host 
   stops the retransmission efforts even if the ACK message is not 
   received.  Default value: 2. 

   Other timer and counter parameter value should be the same as those 
   defined in IGMPv3 and MLDv2.  They will not be re-illustrated in 
   this memo. 

    

7. Security Considerations 

   Security will be considered in the future version of this memo.

Internet-Draft Socket API Extension for MIF Support October 2009


Abstract

The Socket API is the de facto standard of network API for many UNIX-
like and non-UNIX OSes. Many APIs that are exported to the user space is
either direct use or encapsulates the Socket API. The Socket API has
been extended to support IPv6. Recently, multiple interfaces or multiple
connection capable devices become more and more common. But due to the
limitation of the default route of the host and other issues such as DNS
selection etc prevent the utilization of multiple interfaces/connections
benefit. Moreover, there is no API level support for the application
developer to utilize the benefit of the host's multiple
interfaces/connections. Starting with the requirement of MIF API
extension, this document introduces a new set of APIs to support
multiple interfaces/connections.

Internet-Draft Socket API Extension for MIF Support October 2009


1. Introduction

   Socket API was first used in UNIX operating system as network API for
   application developers to develop network applications. Then it is
   introduced to many other operating systems and become a de facto
   standard of network APIs.

   The Socket API needs to be extended according to the evolution of
   TCP/IP protocol stack. For example, the Socket API was extended to
   make it support IPv6 in RFC 3493 [RFC3493]. Nowadays, there are more
   and more devices that have multiple interfaces/connections, but due
   to the limitation of Socket API and other issues such as default
   route and DNS selection, the application developer can not direct use
   the multiple interfaces/connection capability of the devices. This
   document aims to extend the Socket API to make it support multiple
   interfaces/connection while remain compatibility with current Socket.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

3. API Extension Requirement

   This section starts with several requirements for MIF API extension.

3.1. R1: Compatible with existing Socket APIs

   The extension of Socket APIs should remain compatible with current
   existing Socket APIs which means this extension will not affect the
   existing application and the application developer can chose whether
   to use this extension or not.

3.2. R2: Support for Multiple Connections

   The newly introduced APIs can support the host applications to
   utilize multiple connections. If some connections fail to work,
   applications can failover to other available interfaces.

3.3. R3: No Changes to Existing Socket APIs

   The newly introduced APIs cannot change the behavior of existing
   network APIs available on the host operating system.

3.4. R4: Easy for Implementation

   The implementation details for the newly introduced APIs should be as
   neat as possible. It keeps the underlying implementation details
   simple, and makes the application developers easy to use these APIs.

4. Data structure need to be extended

   This document introduces a new data structure named
   Generic_connection in addition to the current Socket API. This is an
   abstraction of the physical connections of the host. The definition
   of this data structure is as follows:

   Struct GenericConnection  {

                  struct GenericConnection *next;

                  int index;

                  struct Netdevice *dev;

                  int priority;

                  char status;

                  struct socket *sock;

                }

   This structure has many data items defined as follows:

   o next: this is an pointer that points to another GenericConnection
      structure. This means that many GenericConnection structure can
      form a link list.

   o index: the index indicates the position of a particular
      GenericConnection item of the GenericConnection structure link
      list.

   o dev: this is a pointer that points to a particular physical
      interface structure.

   o Priority: priority indicates the priority of the connection.

   o status: status indicates the status of current connection.

   o Sock: sock is a pointer that points to a socket structure.

5. Definition of New Socket APIs

   To make it compatible with existing Socket API, this document will
   not define new parameters to existing Socket API. Instead, this
   document defines a set of new socket APIs that used to support
   multiple connections feature.
5.1. Physical interface/connection status acquiring API

   For the host that has multiple interfaces/connections, by invoking
   this API, it can return the current interfaces/connections that the
   host has. The definition of this API is:

   int ListPhysicalConnection(struct Netdevice *dev, int
   connectionNumber), the parameter's definition is:

   o dev: this is a pointer that points to a link list of Netdevice
      structure.

   o connectionNumber: this is the number of the physical connections.

5.2. Connection mapping API

   To map a physical API to the GenericConnection structure, this
   subsection introduces a new API named ConnectionMap() to the current
   Socket API. The definition of this API is as follows:

   int ConnectionMap(struct GenericConnection *G_connection, struct
   Netdevice *dev, int priority, struct socket *sock )

   The definition of the parameters are:

   o G_connection: this is a pointer that points to a GenericConnection
      link list;

   o dev: this is a pointer that points to a physical connection.

   o priority: this parameter defines the priority of this connection.

   o sock: this is a pointer that points to a socket structure.

   This API makes the mapping between the GenericConnection and the
   physical connections. Many physical connections can be mapped to one
   GenericConnection. For example, a host may has a WiFi interface and a
   Ethernet interface, the application developer can first invoke
   ListPhysicalConnection() to acquire the list of physical interfaces,

   then the application can map both WiFi and Ethernet interfaces to the
   same GenericConnection structure.

  Further more, by using this mechanism the OS vender can implement
  their own APIs that supports connection polices. For example, the OS
  vender can provide connection policy API to the application developer
  to enforce connection polices.

  The application developer can also use these functions to implement
  their own connection polices directly. This design gives the
  flexibility of the implementation of connection policies.

5.3. Connection status query API

   This subsection introduces a new API name ConnectionSatusQuery()used
   to query the status of the connections, the definition of this API is
   as follows:

   ConnectionStatusQuery() function returns the current status of the
   GenricConnection, the definition of this API is as follows:

   int ConnectionStatusQuery(struct GenericConnection *G_connection,int
   index, int status),the definition of the parameters are:

   o G_connection a pointer that points to a GenericConnection link
      list.

   o index: the index of the connection that the caller what to query

   o status: the status of the connection that the caller queries

   When the physical connection's status changes, the change will
   reflects by the parameter "status". By invoking this API, the
   application can monitor the status of the physical connections or
   when the physical connection status changes will notify the
   application by setting the "status" parameter to the according value.

5.4. Socket and GenericConnection bind API

   This subsection introduces an API to bind the Socket structure to the
   GenericConnection structure. The definition of this API is as follows:

   BindToConnection(Struct socket *sock, Struct GenericConnection
   *GConnection ), the definition of the parameters are:

   o sock: a pointer that points to a socket structure.

   o GConnection: a pointer that points to a GenericConnection
      structure.

   The purposes of this bind API is to make the GenericConnection
   structure has the socket information.

6. Using the extended APIs

6.1. An Example

   To enjoy the benefit of multiple interfaces, the developers can write
   programs according to the APIs introduced in this document.

   For example, if the application wants to bind to both the Ethernet
   and WiFi interfaces, it can follow the following steps:

   1. create a GenericConnection variable, say gconn;

   2. create two sockets binding to these two interfaces separately,
      sock_wired and sock_wifi;

   3. use the connection mapping API introduced in Sec.5.2 to map the
      sock_wired and sock_wifi to the generic connection struct *gconn;

   4. now that gconn consists of a list of sockets that maps to the
      wired socket and wireless socket separately, the application can
      start data connection using the generic connection class. And the
      implementation details of how the generic connection class
      utilizes those bound interfaces are left to the next section.

6.2. Implementation Details

   The implementation details of these newly introduced APIs are to be
   introduced later.

7. Security Considerations

   TBD

8. IANA Considerations

   TBD

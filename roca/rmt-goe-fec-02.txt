 The Generalized Object Encoding (GOE) Approach for the Forward Erasure
  Correction (FEC) Protection of Objects and its Application to Reed-
                      Solomon Codes over GF(2^^8)
                       draft-roca-rmt-goe-fec-02

Abstract

   This document describes a Generalized Object Encoding (GOE) approach
   for the protection of one or multiple objects, in the context of a
   Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) like FLUTE/ALC, FCAST/ALC or FCAST/
   NORM.  Unlike [RFC5052], the GOE approach [GOE] decouples the
   definition of Generalized Objects over which FEC encoding takes place
   homogeneously, from the natural source object boundaries.  This
   separation enables either an Unequal Erasure Protection (UEP) of
   different portions of a given source object, or an efficient and
   global protection of a set of potentially small files, depending on
   the way the Generalized Objects are defined.

   The present document first of all introduces the GOE approach.  Then
   it defines the GOE Reed-Solomon FEC Scheme for the particular case of
   Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8) and no encoding symbol group, the
   GOE equivalent to FEC Encoding ID 5 defined in RFC5510.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Traditional FEC Schemes, as per [RFC5052]

   The use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes is a classic solution
   to improve the reliability of unicast, multicast and broadcast
   Content Delivery Protocols (CDP) and applications [RFC3453].  The
   [RFC5052] document describes a generic framework to use FEC schemes
   with objects (e.g., files) delivery applications based on the ALC
   [RFC5775] and NORM [RFC5740] reliable multicast transport protocols.

   More specifically, the [RFC5053] (Raptor) and [RFC5170] (LDPC-
   Staircase) FEC schemes introduce erasure codes based on sparse parity
   check matrices for object delivery protocols like ALC and NORM.
   Similarly, the [RFC5510] document introduces Reed-Solomon codes based
   on Vandermonde matrices for the same object delivery protocols.

   The way these FEC schemes is used leads to two limitations
   [ExtendedFEC].  First of all, [RFC5052] defines an approach where the
   same FEC encoding is applied to all the blocks of a given object,
   i.e., the whole object is encoded using the same FEC scheme, with the
   same target code rate, resulting in an equivalent protection.  This
   approach may not suit situations where some subsets of an object
   deserve a higher erasure protection than the others.

   A second limitation is associated to the protection of a large set of
   small objects.  [RFC5052] defines an approach where each object is
   protected individually.  This feature limits the robustness of their
   delivery: since there is a small number of source and repair packets
   for a given small object, a significant number of these packets may
   be erased thereby preventing this object to be decoded at a receiver.
   For instance, if the source and repair packets of a given object are
   transmitted in sequence (which may not be the best strategy), a
   packet erasure burst will significantly impact transmission
   robustness.  Other transmission ordering strategies (e.g., with long
   packet interleavings or random ordering strategies) can reduce the
   impacts of packet erasure bursts, but they do not solve the
   fundamental problem of the protection of small objects.  On the
   opposite a global FEC protection of all the objects of this set,
   using a single FEC encoding (when possible), provides optimal
   transmission robustness, since all the objects can be decoded as long
   as the erasure rate remains lower than the protection brought by the
   FEC code rate.

1.2.  GOE FEC Scheme Principles

   In order to mitigate the limitations of the traditional FEC Schemes,
   a better approach consists in decoupling FEC protection from the

   natural object boundaries.  This is the goal of the Generalized
   Object Encoding (GOE) approach defined in the present document.  The
   GOE approach is independent of the nature of the FEC code, in the
   sense that the general mechanisms it defines are not restricted to a
   single type of FEC code.  On the opposite, the GOE approach can be
   used associated to any of the existing FEC schemes, re-using their
   code definition.  However a new FEC Encoding ID value, a new FEC
   Object Transmission Information (FEC OTI) and a new FEC Payload ID
   (FPI) must be defined in order to accommodate the GOE specifics.
   This means that a dedicated FEC Scheme must be defined, for instance
   for Reed-Solomon codes (re-using the [RFC5510] code definition) and
   for LDPC-Staircase codes (re-using the [RFC5170] code definition).

   The present document, in addition to presenting the GOE approach,
   defines the GOE Reed-Solomon FEC Scheme for the particular case of
   Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8) and no encoding symbol group, the
   GOE equivalent to FEC Encoding ID 5 defined in [RFC5510].  Similar
   documents are expected to specify GOE equivalents to other FEC
   schemes.

   An evaluation of GOE can also be found in [Roumy11] and [Roumy12] and
   a high level overview of GOE is available in [GOEatIETF81].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.1.  Definitions, Notations and Abbreviations

2.1.1.  Definitions

   This document uses the following terms and definitions.  Some of them
   are FEC scheme specific and are in line with [RFC5052]:
   Source Packet:  a data packet containing only source symbols, that is
      sent over the packet erasure channel.  Most of the time a source
      packet will contain a single source symbol.
   Repair Packet:  a data packet containing only repair symbols, that is
      sent over the packet erasure channel.  Most of the time a repair
      packet will contain a single repair symbol.
   Packet Erasure Channel:  a communication path where packets are
      either dropped (e.g., by a congested router, or because the number
      of transmission errors exceeds the correction capabilities of the
      physical layer codes) or received.  When a packet is received, it
      is assumed that this packet is not corrupted.

   Systematic code:  FEC code in which the source symbols are part of
      the encoding symbols.  The Reed-Solomon codes introduced in this
      document are systematic.
   Code rate:  the k/n ratio, i.e., the ratio between the number of
      source symbols and the number of encoding symbols.  By definition,
      the code rate is such that: 0 < code rate <= 1.  A code rate close
      to 1 indicates that a small number of repair symbols have been
      produced during the encoding process.
   Object:  the object (e.g., file) submitted to the CDP by the user.
   Generalized Object:  a group of consecutive source symbols, that
      belong to one or several objects (as defined above) and that are
      considered together for the purpose of a GOE scheme.  Generalized
      objects may be a subset of a given object or at the opposite
      encompass several objects.  The key point when defining
      generalized objects is that all the source symbols of a
      generalized object require an equal erasure protection.
   Source symbol:  unit of data used during the encoding process.  In
      this specification, there is always one source symbol per ADU.
   Encoding symbol:  unit of data generated by the encoding process.
      With systematic codes, source symbols are part of the encoding
      symbols.
   Repair symbol:  encoding symbol that is not a source symbol.
   Source block:  a block of k source symbols that are considered
      together for the encoding.

2.1.2.  Notations

   This document uses the following notations:
   k      denotes the number of source symbols in a source block.
   n      denotes the number of encoding symbols generated for a source
          block.
   E      denotes the encoding symbol length in bytes.
   NO     denotes the number of source objects to be considered.
   NGO    denotes the number of generalized objects to be considered.

2.1.3.  Abbreviations

   This document uses the following abbreviations:
   ADU    stands for Application Data Unit.
   TOI    stands for Transmission Object Identifier.
   SBN    stands for Source Block Number, i.e., a block identifier.
   ESI    stands for Encoding Symbol ID.
   FEC    stands for Forward Error (or Erasure) Correction code.
   LDPC   stands for Low Density Parity Check.

   MDS    stands for Maximum Distance Separable code.
   GO     stands for Generalized Object.
   UEP    stands for Unequal Erasure Protection.
   FEC OTI  stands for FEC Object Transmission Information.


3.  Goals and Requirements

   The main goal of the GOE FEC protection approach is to decouple FEC
   protection from the natural object boundaries, in order to enable
   either a differentiated protection of sub-parts of a single object
   (e.g., to achieve Unequal Erasure Protection (UEP)), or at the
   opposite a global protection of several objects (e.g., a large set of
   small objects).  Appendix A gives two examples where the mapping from
   object(s) to generalized object(s) brings benefits in terms of either
   UEP or global protection of a set of objects.

   Additionally, the following are general requirements for GOE FEC
   schemes:
   o  it MUST be possible, within a single CDP session, to use different
      GOE FEC schemes.  This requirement enables each GOE FEC scheme to
      be used where it is the most valuable, for instance a GOE Reed-
      Solomon FEC scheme MAY be used for a small generalized object
      while a GOE LDPC-Staircase FEC scheme MAY be used for a large
      generalized object;
   o  it MUST be possible, within a single CDP session, to include
      objects protected with one or several GOE FEC schemes and objects
      protected with one or several traditional (i.e., non GOE-
      compatible) FEC schemes.  The same object MAY be protected both
      with a GOE FEC scheme and traditional FEC scheme.  This
      requirement enables GOE FEC schemes to be used only where they
      bring added value;
   o  if a source packet is part of several generalized objects, then
      this source packet MUST be useful to all the associated repair
      flows.  It enables the same flow of source packets to be
      associated to different flows of repair packets, for instance to
      address different sets of receivers with different FEC
      capabilities;

   Because of the GOE features, the following are specific requirements
   that a CDP SHOULD consider:
   o  the order in which the objects are submitted to the CDP is
      significant.  More specifically, if a goal is to enable a global
      protection of several objects, these objects MUST be submitted in
      sequence.  The Transmission Object Identifier (TOI) of these
      objects MUST be sequential.

Internet-Draft          The GOE Approach for FEC               July 2012


   o  the FEC Object Transmission Information (FEC OTI) of a GOE FEC
      scheme determines in particular the composition of a generalized
      object, i.e., which source symbols of which objects are
      considered.  However a receiver needs to know, upon processing
      this FEC OTI, the FEC OTI resulting from the No-Code FEC Encoding
      of each associated object.  There is therefore a dependency that
      the CDP SHOULD try to minimize.  In case of FLUTE, if the same FDT
      Instance ID includes the FEC OTI of all the objects and
      generalized objects, this is not an issue.  In case of LCT, if the
      EXT_FTI mechanism is used to carry the FEC OTI, then great care
      should be taken since the FEC OTI of each object and generalized
      object is transmitted independently.  The CDP sender must be aware
      of that dependency and SHOULD manage the session in such a way to
      maximize the probability that a receiver receives all the required
      FEC OTI in due time.


4.  GOE Principles

4.1.  GOE at a CDP Sender

   Let us consider a CDP sender first.  GOE encoding works as follows:
   o  within the CDP session, let us consider the set of objects that
      need to be protected by a GOE FEC scheme.  These objects MUST be
      submitted submitted sequentially to the CDP and MUST be processed
      in their submission order.  The Transmission Object Identifier
      (TOI) assigned to these objects MUST be sequential.  Let NO be the
      number of such objects.  Let O[i], with i in 1..NO, be these
      objects.  Additional objects, that are not to be considered by a
      GOE FEC scheme, MAY be submitted to the same CDP session.  These
      additional objects are not considered in the following and will be
      managed with a traditional FEC scheme, as defined in [RFC5052],
      without interfering with the GOE FEC scheme(s);
   o  the GOE sender chooses a source symbol size (see Section 6.1 for
      considerations on how to choose this size).  Let E be this source
      symbol size (in bytes).  This is the size that MUST be considered
      for all the NO objects.  By doing so, a generalized object that
      straddles several objects (among the NO possibles) benefits from
      the same source symbol size across object boundaries;
   o  each object, O[i], is encoded with the No-Code FEC scheme (FEC
      Encoding ID 0), to produce an appropriate number of source
      symbols, of fixed size E, except perhaps for the last symbol of an
      object which may be shorter.  This is the standard No-Code FEC
      encoding process, as defined in [RFC5445]; During this encoding,
      each (source) symbol is assigned a unique {TOI, SBN, ESI} tuple
      that fully identifies this symbol within the whole CDP session;

Internet-Draft          The GOE Approach for FEC               July 2012


   o  the set of source symbols from all the NO objects is now truncated
      into one or more sequences of symbols, called Generalized Objects
      (GO).  Let NGO be the number of such generalized objects.  Let
      GO[i], with i in 1..NGO, be these generalized objects.  The size
      (i.e., number of source symbols) of a generalized object depends
      on the desired protection features and is left as a choice for the
      CDP.  The generalized objects MAY also overlap (e.g., a given
      subset of source symbols can be FEC protected multiple times).  On
      the opposite, there MAY be gaps (e.g., if the sender considers
      that a given subset of source symbols is not worth any FEC
      protection).  The key point when defining generalized objects is
      that all the source symbols of a generalized object require an
      equal erasure protection;
   o  each generalized object, GO[i], is assigned a new TOI value,
      otherwise unused.  It consists of a sequence of a certain number
      of source symbols (i.e., the size of this generalized object),
      starting from the Initial Source Symbol ISS_i whose {TOI, SBN,
      ESI} tuple is well known.
   o  each generalized object is partitioned into source blocks using
      the standard block partitioning algorithm defined in Section 9.1
      of [RFC5052].  This algorithm is used in the same way, with the
      exception that the term "object" of that algorithm should be
      replaced by "generalized object" as defined in this document, and
      the variable T (number of source symbols in the object) of that
      algorithm is already known and is the "size of the generalized
      object" as defined in this document;
   o  for a given source block, source symbols of size strictly inferior
      to E are first zero padded (this may happen if the generalized
      object straddles several objects as explained above).  Then FEC
      encoding takes place for this block, taking into account the
      optional zero padding (when present), using the associated GOE FEC
      Scheme.  A certain number of FEC repair symbols is produced,
      depending on the target coding rate.  Although the FEC codes used
      by a particular GOE FEC scheme is systematic (i.e., source symbols
      are part of the encoding symbols), these source symbols MUST NOT
      be sent to the receivers as GOE FEC scheme symbols, since they
      will already be sent as No-Code FEC scheme symbols;
   o  FEC OTI for this generalized object is communicated to the
      receiver(s) using the same mechanisms (in-band versus out-of-band)
      as those used for other objects of that session if any [RFC5052].
      At a minimum the Scheme-specific element of this FEC OTI
      identifies the ISS and size (in terms number of source symbols)
      for that generalized object.  Additional information may be added
      as required by the GOE FEC scheme;
   o  to each FEC repair symbol an FPI, that is specific to the GOE FEC
      Scheme used, is attached that indicates which block of which
      generalized object this FEC repair symbol belongs to, and its
      position within this block.  Within the LCT or NORM header, the

Internet-Draft          The GOE Approach for FEC               July 2012


      TOI of each repair symbol is that of the generalized object;
   o  then source and repair packets are sent over the network, using an
      appropriate packet ordering scheme that is out of the scope of
      this document;

4.2.  GOE at a CDP Receiver

   Let us now consider a CDP receiver.  GOE decoding works as follows:
   o  upon reception of a FEC OTI for an object that is considered by at
      least one generalized object, using either an in-band or out-of-
      band mechanism, process this FEC OTI in order to be ready to
      process the source symbols received with a No-Code FEC scheme.
      Note that the information contained in this FEC OTI will be
      required during the processing of the FEC OTI of the associated
      generalized object(s);
   o  upon reception of a FEC OTI for a generalized object, using either
      an in-band or out-of-band mechanism, process this FEC OTI in order
      to be ready to process the repair symbols received with a GOE FEC
      scheme, for the same generalized object;
   o  in case of a packet associated to a traditional FEC scheme, then
      process this packet in the traditional way.
   o  if the receiver is not interested by a generalized object(s) or
      does not support the GOE FEC scheme(s) being used, this receiver
      silently discards the associated packets;
   o  process all incoming packets containing a source symbol for one of
      the NO objects, generated with a No-Code FEC encoding, in the
      traditional way.  If this source symbol is part of one (or
      several) generalized object(s), check whether this fresh symbol
      helps in decoding a block;
   o  incoming packets containing a repair symbol for one of the NGO
      generalized objects are easily identified by their TOI value (and
      in case of an ALC session by the Codepoint value of the LCT
      header, that contains the GOE FEC Encoding ID).  Process this
      packet as specified by the GOE FEC scheme.  Then check whether
      this fresh symbol helps in decoding a block of the generalized
      object;

   Concerning FEC OTI processing, as explained in Section 3, if a given
   generalized object, say GO[0], includes source symbols that belong to
   several objects, say O[0], O[1] and O[2], then at some point of time,
   the receiver must have processed the FEC OTI of both GO[0] and O[0],
   O[1] and O[2].  When the FEC OTI is sent in separate packets (e.g.,
   if FEC OTI is sent within EXT_FTI LCT or NORM header extensions),
   there is a dependency between all of them.  The CDP sender must be
   aware of that dependency and SHOULD manage the session in such a way
   to maximize the probability that a receiver receives all the required
   FEC OTI in due time.

5.  Formats and Codes with FEC Encoding ID XXX for Reed-Solomon codes
    over GF(2^^8)

   This section introduces the formats and codes associated with the
   Fully-Specified FEC Scheme with FEC Encoding ID XXX, which focuses on
   the special case of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8) and no encoding
   symbol group.  This GOE FEC Scheme is the GOE equivalent to FEC
   Encoding ID 5 defined in [RFC5510].

5.1.  FEC Payload ID (for Repair Packets Only)

   The FEC Payload ID, to be used only with repair packets, i.e.,
   packets containing a repair symbol each, is composed of the Source
   Block Number (SBN) and the Encoding Symbol ID (ESI).  There is no
   change in terms of format with respect to [RFC5510] but a restriction
   in terms of valid ESI as explained below:

   o  The Source Block Number (24-bit field) identifies from which
      source block of the object the encoding symbol in the payload is
      generated.  There is a maximum of 2^^24 blocks per object.
   o  The Encoding Symbol ID (8-bit field) identifies which specific
      encoding symbol generated from the source block is carried in the
      packet payload.  There is a maximum of 2^^8 encoding symbols per
      block.  The first k values (0 to k - 1) identify source symbols;
      the remaining n-k values (k to n-k-1) identify repair symbols.
      Since only repair symbols are considered by this GOE FEC scheme,
      only the k to n-k-1 values, inclusive, MUST be used.

   There MUST be exactly one FEC Payload ID per repair packet.  This FEC
   Payload ID refers to the one and only symbol of the packet.

5.2.2.  Common Elements

   The Common elements are the same as those specified in [RFC5510] for
   FEC Encoding ID 5, namely: the Transfer-Length (L), the Encoding-
   Symbol-Length (E), the Maximum-Source-Block-Length (B), the Max-
   Number-of-Encoding-Symbols (max_n).  These common elements refer to
   the Generalized Object for which Reed-Solomon encoding is needed..

5.2.3.  Scheme-Specific Elements

   The following element MUST be defined with the present FEC scheme.
   It defines the composition of a generalized object:

   o  the Initial Source Symbol TOI (ISS_TOI) identifies the TOI of the
      first source symbol of this generalized object.  The exact format
      of this field depends on the TOI format, which is CDP and use-case
      specific.  For instance the TOI field of an ALC session is stored
      in a field of length 32*O+16*H bits, where O and H are the TOI
      flag and Half-word flag defined in LCT's header;
   o  the ISS TOI size (ISS_O) two bit field determines the TOI size,
      which is equal to 32*ISS_O + 30 bits.  This flexibility is meant
      to be compatible with any NORM or ALC TOI format;
   o  the ISS Source Block Number (ISS_SBN) identifies the SBN of the
      first source symbol of this generalized object, within its
      original object.  This is a 16 bit field, since this value results
      from the No-Code FEC encoding of the original object;
   o  the ISS Encoding Symbol ID (ISS_ESI) identifies the ESI of the
      first source symbol of this generalized object, within its
      original block.  This is a 16 bit field, since this value results
      from the No-Code FEC encoding of the original object;
   o  the Generalized Object Size identifies the size, in terms of
      number of source symbols that compose this generalized object;

5.2.4.  Encoding Format

   This section shows the two possible encoding formats of the above FEC
   OTI.  The present document does not specify when one encoding format
   or the other should be used.

5.2.4.1.  Using the General EXT_FTI Format

   The FEC OTI binary format is the following, when the EXT_FTI
   mechanism is used (e.g., within the ALC [RFC5775] or NORM [RFC5740]
   protocols).

5.2.4.2.  Using the FDT Instance (FLUTE specific)

   When it is desired that the FEC OTI be carried in the FDT Instance of
   a FLUTE session [FLUTE], the following XML attributes must be
   described for the associated object:
   o  FEC-OTI-FEC-Encoding-ID
   o  FEC-OTI-Transfer-Length (L)
   o  FEC-OTI-Encoding-Symbol-Length (E)
   o  FEC-OTI-Maximum-Source-Block-Length (B)
   o  FEC-OTI-Max-Number-of-Encoding-Symbols (max_n)
   o  FEC-OTI-Scheme-Specific-Info
   The FEC-OTI-Scheme-Specific-Info contains the string resulting from
   the Base64 encoding (in the XML Schema xs:base64Binary sense) of the
   following value:

    0                   1                   2                   3

                               FDT Instance

   During Base64 encoding, the FEC OTI Scheme-Specific Information (of
   variable length) is transformed into a string of printable characters
   (in the 64-character alphabet) that is added to the FEC-OTI-Scheme-
   Specific-Info attribute.


6.  Procedures with FEC Encoding ID XXX for Reed-Solomon codes over
    GF(2^^8)

   This section defines procedures that MUST be applied to FEC Encoding
   ID XXX.  The block partitioning algorithm that is defined in Section
   9.1 of [RFC5052] MUST be used.  The procedure called "Determining the
   Maximum Source Block Length (B)" in [RFC5510] MUST be used.  The
   procedure called "Determining the Number of Encoding Symbols of a
   Block" in [RFC5510] MUST be used.

6.1.  Determining the Encoding Symbol Length (E)

   The E parameter usually depends on the maximum transmission unit on
   the path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) from the source to each
   receiver.  This PMTU may be known, may be discovered, or may be
   estimated, depending on the target use case.  In order to minimize
   the protocol header overhead (e.g., the Layered Coding Transport
   (LCT), UDP, IPv4, or IPv6 headers in the case of ALC), E MAY be
   chosen to be as large as possible.  In that case, E is chosen so that
   the size of a packet composed of a single encoding symbol remains
   below but close to the PMTU (or by the minimum PMTU to each possible
   destinations in case of one-to-many sessions).  This value E is also
   the source symbol size (i.e., the source symbols, before FEC
   encoding, and the encoding symbols, after FEC encoding, are of equal
   size).

   This size MUST be used to segment all of the NO objects considered by
   the GOE FEC schemes for this CDP into source symbols.  By doing so, a
   Generalized Object that straddles several objects (among the NO
   possibles) benefits from the same source symbol size across object
   boundaries.

Appendix A.  Two Examples of GOE Protection of Objects

   Figure 4 is an example of use of a GOE FEC scheme to provide unequal
   erasure protection of a large object, whose first part is of higher
   importance than the second part.  Different code rates are applied to
   each generalized object, to provide for different erasure protection.
   The 80 packets generated after a No-Code FEC encoding of the object
   of TOI 1, along with the 20 repair symbols generated after a Reed-
   Solomon(60, 40) encoding of the high priority generalized object of
   TOI=10 and the 10 repair symbols generated after a Reed-Solomon(50,
   40) encoding of the low priority generalized object of TOI=11 are
   sent over the network.

   globally protect a set of small objects.  A single generalized object
   of TOI 10 is defined that gathers the source symbols of the original
   objects of TOI 1 to 7 inclusive.  The 80 packets generated after a

   the generalized object of TOI=10 are sent over the network.  With an
   MDS code, any subset of 80 packets among the 120 possible packets are
   sufficient to decode all the original objects.

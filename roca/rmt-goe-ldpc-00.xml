		<abstract>
<t>
This document describes a Generalized Object Encoding (GOE) FEC Scheme for the protection of
one or multiple objects, in the context of a Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) like FLUTE/ALC, FCAST/ALC
or FCAST/NORM.
Unlike [RFC5052], the GOE approach [GOE] decouples the definition of Generalized Objects over which FEC
encoding takes place homogeneously, from the natural source object boundaries.
This separation enables either an Unequal Erasure Protection (UEP) of different portions of a given
source object, or an efficient and global protection of a set of potentially small files,
depending on the way the Generalized Objects are defined.
</t>
<t>
The present document defines the GOE LDPC-Staircase FEC Scheme, i.e., the GOE version of the
FEC Encoding ID 3 (LDPC-Staircase) defined in [RFC5170] with the further restriction that the number of
encoding symbols per group (i.e., the number of symbols sent in the same packet) MUST be equal to 1 (G=1).
This document does not change the LDPC-Staircase code definition, and therefore it inherits most of [RFC5170].
It only modifies the FEC Payload ID and FEC OTI, i.e., it addresses the problem of UEP and efficient file bundle protection
by means of pure signaling approach.

<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
<!-- =========================================== -->

  <section title="Traditional FEC Schemes, as per [RFC5052]">
  <!-- =========================================== -->

<t>The use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes is a classic solution to improve the
reliability of unicast, multicast and broadcast Content Delivery Protocols (CDP) and applications
<xref target="RFC3453"/>.
The <xref target="RFC5052"/> document describes a generic framework to use FEC schemes
with objects (e.g., files) delivery applications based on the ALC  <xref target="RFC5775"/>
and NORM <xref target="RFC5740"/> reliable multicast transport protocols.
</t>

<t>More specifically, the <xref target="RFC5053"/> (Raptor) and <xref target="RFC5170"/>
(LDPC-Staircase) FEC schemes introduce erasure codes based on sparse parity check matrices
for object delivery protocols like ALC and NORM.
Similarly, the <xref target="RFC5510"/> document introduces Reed-Solomon codes based on
Vandermonde matrices for the same object delivery protocols.
</t>

<t>
The way these FEC schemes is used leads to two limitations.
First of all, <xref target="RFC5052"/> defines an approach where the same FEC encoding
is applied to all the blocks of a given object, i.e., the whole object is encoded using
the same FEC scheme, with the same target code rate, resulting in an equivalent protection.
This approach may not suit situations where some subsets of an object deserve a
higher erasure protection than the others.
</t>

<t>
A second limitation is associated to the protection of a large set of small objects.
<xref target="RFC5052"/> defines an approach where each object is protected individually.
This feature limits the robustness of their delivery: since there is a small number of
source and repair packets for a given small object, a significant number of these packets
may be erased thereby preventing this object to be decoded at a receiver.
For instance, if the source and repair packets of a given object are transmitted in sequence
(which may not be the best strategy), a packet erasure burst will significantly impact
transmission robustness.
Other transmission ordering strategies (e.g., with long packet interleavings or random
ordering strategies) can reduce the impacts of packet erasure bursts, but they do not
solve the fundamental problem of the protection of small objects.
On the opposite a global FEC protection of all the objects of this set, using a single
FEC encoding (when possible), provides optimal transmission robustness, since all the
objects can be decoded as long as the erasure rate remains lower than the protection
brought by the FEC code rate.
</t>

  </section>

  <section title="GOE FEC Scheme Principles">
  <!-- =========================================== -->

<t>
In order to mitigate the limitations of the traditional FEC Schemes, a better approach
consists in decoupling FEC protection from the natural object boundaries.
This is the goal of the Generalized Object Encoding (GOE) approach <xref target="GOE"/>.
The set of source objects is first encoded using the No-Code FEC Scheme <xref target="RFC5445"/>.
Each source symbol of each source object is therefore individually identified by its
{TOI (i.e., ALC or NORM object identifier); SBN (source block identifier); ESI (symbol identifier)} tupple.
Each Generalized Object is then defined as a sequence of consecutive No-Code encoding
symbols, that starts at a given symbol, identified by its {TOI, SBN, ESI} tuple, and
that is composed of a given number of such symbols.
Each Generalized Object is then FEC encoded using an appropriate FEC code, with an
appropriate code rate.
Of course a Generalized Object may be a subset of a given source object or at the opposite
may encompass several source objects.
The key point when defining Generalized Objects is that all the corresponding source symbols
require an equal erasure protection.
</t>

<t>
The GOE approach is independent of the nature of the FEC code, in the sense that
the general mechanisms it defines is not restricted to a single type of FEC code.
On the opposite, the GOE approach can be associated to any of the existing FEC schemes,
re-using their code definition.
However a new FEC Encoding ID value, a new FEC Object Transmission Information (FEC OTI)
and a new FEC Payload ID (FPI) must be defined in order to accommodate the GOE specifics.
This means that a dedicated FEC Scheme must be defined.
For instance, <xref target="GOE"/> defines the GOE Reed-Solomon FEC Scheme for the particular case of
Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8) and no encoding symbol group, the GOE equivalent to
FEC Encoding ID 5 defined in <xref target="RFC5510"/>.
</t>

<t>
The present document defines the GOE LDPC-Staircase FEC Scheme, i.e., the GOE version of the
FEC Encoding ID 3 (LDPC-Staircase) defined in <xref target="RFC5170"/>, with the further restriction
that the number of encoding symbols per group (i.e., the number of symbols sent in the same packet)
MUST be equal to 1 (G=1).
</t>

<t>
Please refer to <xref target="GOE"/> for the details on the GOE procedures at a sender
and at a receiver.
An evaluation of GOE can also be found in <xref target="GOE.RR7699"/>.
Finally <xref target="GOEatIETF81"/> provides a high level overview of GOE.

<section title="Formats and Codes with FEC Encoding ID XXX for LDPC-Staircase Codes">
<!-- ========================== -->

<t>This section introduces the formats and codes associated with the Fully-Specified FEC Scheme
with FEC Encoding ID XXX, which focuses on LDPC-Staircase Codes.
This GOE FEC Scheme is the GOE equivalent to FEC Encoding ID 3 defined in <xref target="RFC5170"/>,
with the further restriction that the number of encoding symbols per group (i.e., the number of symbols
sent in the same packet) MUST be equal to 1 (G=1).
</t>


  <section title="FEC Payload ID (for Repair Packets Only)">
  <!-- =========================-->
  
<t>The FEC Payload ID, to be used only with repair packets, i.e., packets containing a repair symbol each,
is composed of the Source Block Number (SBN) and the Encoding Symbol ID (ESI).
There is no change in terms of format with respect to <xref target="RFC5170"/> but a restriction
in terms of valid ESI as explained below:</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>The Source Block Number (12-bit field) identifies from which source block
   of the object the encoding symbol in the payload is generated.
   There is a maximum of 2^^12 blocks per object.</t>

<t>The Encoding Symbol ID (20-bit field) identifies which specific encoding
   symbol generated from the source block is carried in the packet payload.
   There is a maximum of 2^^20 encoding symbols per block.
   The first k values (0 to k - 1) identify source symbols; the remaining n-k
   values (k to n-k-1) identify repair symbols.
   Since only repair symbols are considered by this GOE FEC scheme, only the k to n-k-1 values,
   inclusive, MUST be used.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>There MUST be exactly one FEC Payload ID per repair packet (since G=1).
This FEC Payload ID refers to the one and only symbol of the packet.

        number of "1s" per column in the left side of the parity check

        See <xref target="RFC5170"/> for guidelines on how to set N1m3.</t>

    <t> G: in this specification, G MUST be equal to 1.</t>

    <t> the Initial Source Symbol TOI (ISS_TOI) identifies the TOI of
	the first source symbol of this generalized object.
	The exact format of this field depends on the TOI format, which is
	CDP and use-case specific. For instance the TOI field of an ALC session
	is stored in a field of length 32*O+16*H bits, where O and H are the
	TOI flag and Half-word flag defined in LCT's header;</t>

    <t> the ISS TOI size (ISS_O) two bit field determines the TOI size,
	which is equal to 32*ISS_O + 30 bits. This flexibility is meant to be compatible with
	any NORM or ALC TOI format;</t>

    <t> the ISS Source Block Number (ISS_SBN) identifies the SBN of
	the first source symbol of this generalized object, within its

	from the No-Code FEC encoding of the original object;</t>

    <t> the ISS Encoding Symbol ID (ISS_ESI) identifies the ESI of

This PMTU may be known, may be discovered, or may be estimated, depending on
the target use case.
In order to minimize the protocol header overhead (e.g., the Layered Coding Transport
(LCT), UDP, IPv4, or IPv6 headers in the case of ALC), E MAY be chosen to be as large
as possible.
In that case, E is chosen so that the size of a packet composed of a single
encoding symbol remains below but close to the PMTU (or by the minimum PMTU
to each possible destinations in case of one-to-many sessions).
This value E is also the source symbol size (i.e., the source symbols, before
FEC encoding, and the encoding symbols, after FEC encoding, are of equal size).
</t>

<t>
This size MUST be used to segment all of the NO source objects considered by the GOE FEC
schemes for this CDP into source symbols.
By doing so, a Generalized Object that straddles several objects (among the NO possibles)
benefits from the same source symbol size across source object boundaries.

<t>
LDPC-Staircase codes have excellent erasure recovery capabilities with
large source blocks, close to ideal MDS codes.
For instance, with a medium source block size k=1024, CR=2/3, N1=5, G=1, with a hybrid
ITerative/Maximum Likelihood (IT/ML) decoding approach (see below) and when all symbols
are sent in a random order (see below), the average overhead
amounts to 0.64% (corresponding to 6.5 symbols in addition to k) and receiving
1043 symbols (corresponding to a 1.9% overhead) is sufficient to reduce the decoding
failure probability to 5.1*10^^-5.
</t>

<t>
LDPC-Staircase codes are also a good solution whenever processing
requirements at a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a minimum.
This is true when the decoder uses an IT decoding algorithm,
or an ML algorithm (we use a Gaussian Elimination as the ML algorithm) when
this latter is carefully implemented and the source block size kept reasonable,
or a mixture of both techniques which is the recommended solution.
For instance an average decoding speed between 1.3 Gbps (corresponding to a very
bad channel, close to the theoretical decoding limit and requiring an ML decoding)
and 4.3 Gbps (corresponding to a medium quality channel where IT decoding is sufficient)
are easily achieved with a source block size composed of k=1024 source symbols,
a code rate CR=2/3 (i.e., 512 repair symbols), 1024 byte long symbols, G=1, and N1=5,
on an Intel Xeon 5120/1.86GHz workstation running Linux/64 bits.
Additionally, with a hybrid IT/ML approach, a receiver can decide if and when
ML decoding is used, depending on local criteria (e.g., battery or CPU
capabilities), independently from other receivers.
</t>

<t>
As the source block size decreases, the erasure recovery capabilities
of LDPC codes in general also decrease.
In the case of LDPC-Staircase codes, in order to compensate this phenomenon,
it is recommended to increase the N1 parameter and to use a hybrid IT/ML decoding approach.
For instance, with a small source block size k=256 symbols, CR=2/3, N1=7, and G=1,
the average overhead amounts to 0.67% (corresponding to 1.7 symbols in addition to k),
and receiving 267 symbols (corresponding to a 4.3% overhead)
is sufficient to reduce the decoding failure probability to 1.4*10^^-5.
Using N1=9 further improves these results if need be, which also enables
to use LDPC-Staircase codes with k=100 symbols for instance.
</t>

<t>
With very small source blocks (e.g., a few tens symbols), using for instance
Reed-Solomon codes <xref target="RFC5510"/> or 2D parity check codes
MAY be more appropriate.
</t>

<t>
The way the FEC Repair Packets are transmitted is of high importance.
A good strategy, that works well for any kind of channel loss model, consists
in sending FEC Repair Packets in random order (rather than in sequence) while
FEC Source Packets are sent first and in sequence.
Sending all packets in a random order is another possibility, but it requires
that all repair symbols for a source block be produced first, which adds some
extra delay at a sender.

Internet-Draft   Learning IPv6 Prefix of 6/4 Translator     October 2009


   if it knows the IPv6 prefix of the IPv6/IPv4 translator.  In many
   IPv6/IPv4 translation deployments, that IPv6 prefix is not fixed;
   rather, the prefix is chosen by the network operator.  This
   specification provides three methods for a host to learn the IPv6
   prefix of its IPv6/IPv4 translator.  Unicast, any-source multicast
   (ASM), and source-specific multicast (SSM) are supported.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   AFT:  Address Family Translator.  A device that translates between IP
   address families.

   DNS64:  The function of synthesizing an AAAA record from an A record
   (also called "DNS rewriting" or "DNS-ALG"), described in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].

   NSP (Network-Specific Prefix):  A prefix assigned to an IPv6/IPv4
   translator that uses a prefix belonging to the network operator.


2.  Introduction

   Certain applications, operating in certain translation scenarios, can
   benefit from knowing the IPv6 prefix of their IPv6/IPv4 translator.
   First, the host must be operating in an IPv6-initiated scenario with
   a local translator.  The Framework document
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework] describes these as Scenario 1, "IPv6
   network to IPv4 Internet", and Scenario 5, "An IPv6 network to an
   IPv4 network".  Learning the prefix is useful for both stateful
   translation and stateless translation.

   With those scenarios, the IPv6 host usually performs a DNS AAAA query
   which is processed by a DNS64 server.  The DNS64 server generates a
   synthetic AAAA response, when necessary.  This synthetic AAAA
   response contains the prefix of the IPv6/IPv4 translator.  When the
   IPv6 host sends a packet to that address returned in the AAAA
   response, the packet is routed to the translator which translates it
   to IPv4.  This functionality is transparent to the IPv6 host, for the
   most part.

   However, an IPv6 application can also obtain an IPv4 address literal
   and wants to communicate with that IPv4 address.  So far, several
   scenarios have been identified where this occurs:

   o  host-based DNSSEC validation (Section 6 of
      [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64])

   o  BitTorrent (Section 2.2 of [I-D.wing-behave-nat64-referrals])

   o  multicast translation ([I-D.venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework] and
      Section 4 of [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46])

   o  URI schemes with host IPv4 address literals rather than domain
      names (e.g., http://192.0.2.1, ftp://192.0.2.1, imap://192.0.2.1,
      ipp://192.0.2.1)).  See also
      [I-D.wing-behave-http-ip-address-literals] which describes a
      different workaround than the solution described in this document.

   o  update the host's RFC3484 preference table to prefer translated
      prefixes below native prefixes.

   o  allow the host to perform its own DNS64 function.  This allows the
      host to provide translation functions to IPv4 applications using,
      for example, BIS [I-D.huang-behave-rfc2767bis] or BIA
      [I-D.huang-behave-rfc3338bis].

   When an IPv6/IPv4 translator is used with a Network-Specific Prefix
   (NSP), it is necessary for such applications to learn the IPv6 prefix
   (and length) of the translator so that the application can create an
   IPv6 packet that will be routed to the translator and be translated
   to IPv4.

      Issue-1:  Even when the Well-Known Prefix (WKP) is used, it may be
      useful for the host and/or the applications to know there is, in
      fact, a translator operating on the network.  The mechanisms
      described in this draft could provide such an indication to the
      host and its applications.  The need for learning the prefix with
      WKP is for future study.


3.  Discussion on Mechanisms

   Both DNS and DHCP are described in this document.  It would be
   desirable to use DHCPv6, as it is intended to configure network
   settings such as the network's IPv6/IPv4 translator.  However, there
   is not ubiquitous support of DHCPv6.

   DNS:

      *  available to all OSs and applications, without regard for OS
         support or network device support.

   DHCPv6:

      *  requires DHCPv6 support in host operating system and network.
         Apple's OSX does not support DHCPv6.

      *  requires OS provide API for application to query the new DHCP
         option described in this document.  Microsoft's Windows Vista
         provides such an API.  Support in other OSs is unknown.

      Issue-2:  Should we pick DNS over DHCPv6?


4.  Mechanisms to Learn the Translator's IPv6 Prefix and Length

   Both the IPv6 prefix of the translator and the prefix length of the
   translator need to be learned.  With that information, the
   application can generate an appropriate IPv6 address that will be
   routed to the translator for the translator to process.

   The host can learn the necessary information using DNS or DHCP as
   described in the following sections.

      Issue-3:  If a conflict exists between DNS or DHCP which should
      take precedence?

4.1.  Using DNS

      Issue-4:  Should we just use a TXT record, perhaps like
      "_TRANSLATE64", "_ASMTRANSLATE64", and "_SSMTRANSLATE64", instead
      of using NAPTR?  A simple TXT record would ensure immediate
      ubiquitous support across all OSs and all DNS management systems.

   This specification defines a new U-NAPTR [RFC4848] application to
   discover the translator's IPv6 prefix and length.  The input domain
   name is the exact same as would be used for a reverse DNS lookup,
   derived from the host's IPv6 in the ".ip6.arpa." tree and follows the
   construction rules in Section 2.5 of [RFC3596].  This is shortened to
   20 labels (representing a /64 network prefix) and, if DNS returns an
   error is shortened to 16 labels (representing a /48 network prefix).

   If an IPv6/IPv4 translator is present on the network, the successful
   result of one of those queries will produce a NAPTR record with the
   desired service tag "TRANSLATE64:" which contains the unicast IPv6
   prefix and prefix length of the translator, separated by a "/" (the
   same syntax as specified in Section 2.3 of [RFC4291]).  The service
   tags "ASMTRANSLATE64:" and "SSMTRANSLATE:" are used for ASM and SSM.

   For example, a host with the IP address 2001:db8:1:2:3:4:567:89ab
   would first send an NAPTR query for
   3.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA (20 elements,
   representing a /64 network prefix).  If that fails (returns
   NXDOMAIN), it would send an NAPTR query for
   2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA (16 elements, representing a
   /48 network prefix).

      Note:  Both /64 and /48 prefix lengths are shown in this version
      of the document for illustrative purposes.  The number of elements

      of this query will depend on the prefix length(s) defined by the
      BEHAVE working group for a translator.  If the BEHAVE working
      group decides that all translators will have a certain prefix
      length, then only one DNS query is sent.

   If the host needs to authenticate the prefix it just learned (e.g.,
   because the host is running a DNSSEC validator) the host performs the
   additional authentication steps described in Section 5.

4.2.  Using DHCPv6

   A new DHCP option, OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_DHCP, is defined.  It contains
   the IPv6 unicast prefix, IPv6 ASM prefix, and IPv6 SSM prefix (and
   their lengths) for the IPv6/IPv4 translator on this network.

   If the host needs to authenticate the prefix it just learned (e.g.,
   because the host is running a DNSSEC validator) the host performs the
   additional authentication steps described in Section 5.


5.  Authenticating the Learned Prefix

   In some cases (e.g., a host performing DNSSEC validation), the host
   needs to authenticate the translator's IPv6 prefix learned via one of
   the mechanisms described earlier.  To allow such authentication the
   operator of the translator first creates a PTR record for the
   translator (with 0's for the elements after the translator's IPv6
   prefix) which points to a hostname.  The hostname has a signed AAAA
   record for the same 0-padded IPv6 address returned by the PTR query.
   Once those configuration steps are done, a host can validate the

Internet-Draft   Learning IPv6 Prefix of 6/4 Translator     October 2009


   translator's IPv6 prefix by performing the following steps:

   a.  The host sends a DNS PTR query for the IPv6 address of the
       translator (for "ipv6.arpa"), using 0 for the elements after the
       prefix length.  This will return the fully-qualified hostname of
       that translator device.

   b.  Verify the full-qualified hostname is on the host's configured
       list of authorized translators (e.g.,
       seattle.translator.example.net).

   c.  Send a DNS AAAA query for that hostname.

   d.  Verify the AAAA response matches the IPv6 address obtained in
       step 1.

   e.  Perform DNSSEC validation of the AAAA response.

   For example, if the translator's IPv6 prefix length is /48, the host
   would send a PTR query for 2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.2.3.4.IP6.ARPA
   which would return a hostname, seattle.translator.example.net.  The
   host verifies that seattle.translator.example.net is on its
   configured list of authorized translators, as maintained in a text
   file.  The host sends an AAAA query for
   seattle.translator.example.net and verifies the AAAA response
   contains the same IPv6 address.  The host then validates the DNSSEC
   signature for seattle.translator.example.net.


6.  Security Considerations

   After learning the IPv6 prefix of its translator by following the
   procedures in this specification, the IPv6 host will utilize this
   information for subsequent actions (e.g., sending a packet to it, or
   using that information to synthesize DNS records or to perform DNSSEC
   validation).  If an attacker provides a fraudulent IPv6 to the IPv6
   host, the attacker can become on-path for traffic to/from that IPv6
   host and preform passive or active eavesdropping or traffic analysis.
   To protect against this attack, it is RECOMMENDED that IPv6 hosts be
   configured with the names of authorized translators and RECOMMENDED
   that IPv6 hosts uses DNSSEC to validate that name matches the IPv6
   prefix learned via DNS or DHCPv6 as described in Section 5.


7.  IANA Considerations

   A new DHCPv6 option, OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_DHCP, needs to be assigned by
   IANA.

Internet-Draft   Learning IPv6 Prefix of 6/4 Translator     October 2009


   [RFC3596]  Thomson, S., Huitema, C., Ksinant, V., and M. Souissi,
              "DNS Extensions to Support IP Version 6", RFC 3596,
              October 2003.

   [RFC4291]  Hinden, R. and S. Deering, "IP Version 6 Addressing
              Architecture", RFC 4291, February 2006.


Appendix A.  For future study

A.1.  multi-homed hosts

   A multi-homed host may have different translation devices available
   on each of its networks, and can learn those via DNS, DHCP.

   When using DNS to learn the translator's prefix (Section 4.1) or
   using DNS to authenticate the translator prefix (Section 5, it is
   possible a split horizon DNS exists.  Such a split DNS requires the
   host to query the DNS server associated with that network prefix as
   described in [I-D.savolainen-mif-dns-server-selection].

A.2.  Unicast and multicast translators

   It may be necessary to use different prefixes for unicast, any source
   multicast (ASM), and source-specific multicast (SSM) (Section 2 of
   [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46]).


Appendix B.  IPv4 Address Literals on the Internet

   There has been some doubt that IPv4 address literals occur on the
   Internet.  An examination of the top 1 million domains at the end of
   August, 2009, showed 2.38% of the HTML in their home pages contained
   IPv4 address literals.  This can be verified by examining the output
   of the following script:

     wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip
     unzip top-1m.csv.zip
     cat top-1m.csv |
       cut -d "," -f 2 |
       xargs -I % -n 1 -t wget -nv % -O - --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0" |
       grep -E "http://[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}"

Internet-Draft   Learning IPv6 Prefix of 6/4 Translator     October 2009


   Of the top 1 million websites at the end of August, 2009, 3455 of
   them are IPv4 address literals.  This can be verified with the
   following script:

     wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip
     unzip top-1m.csv.zip
     grep -E "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}"
       top-1m.csv | wc


Appendix C.  Changes

C.1.  Changes from -03 to -04

   o  Provided examples of IPv4 address literals with HTTP on the
      Internet (Appendix B).

   o  removed Router Advertisements.

C.2.  Changes from -02 to -03

   o  Removed FTP interworking, because [I-D.van-beijnum-behave-ftp64]
      proposes that FTP clients use the same IP address for the data
      connection as the control connection.  This eliminates the need
      for the FTP client to learn the translator's prefix.

   o  Added multicast to DHCP and RA messages.

C.3.  Changes from -01 to -02

   o  provided another method of using RA message for a host to learn
      its translator's IPv6 prefix and length

   o  added IPv4 address literals in URIs and multicast as benefactors
      for learning the translator's prefix.

   o  added FTP interworking using PASV

   o  clarified which Scenarios this applies to, and that this is for
      stateful and stateless.

C.4.  Changes from -00 to -01

   o  made clearer this is for NAT64 prefix (changed title and some
      text).

   o  changed from querying for "_aft_prefix" TXT record to querying
      ipv6.arpa NAPTR record.

Internet-Draft   Learning IPv6 Prefix of 6/4 Translator     October 2009


   o  BitTorrent is another application that benefits from knowing the
      NAT64 prefix; previously only DNSSEC was listed.

   o  changed to standards track.

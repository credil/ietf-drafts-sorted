Abstract

   As IPv6-only hosts become commonplace, it is desirable to still have
   IPv4 clients access those IPv6-only hosts.  Due to the size of the
   IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces, this has proven difficult using pure IP

   or even all TCP or UDP applications, this document proposes a
   mechanism for an IPv4 HTTP client to connect to an IPv6-only HTTP
   server.

Internet-Draft       Relaying HTTP from IPv4 to IPv6        October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Two of the scenarios considered by the BEHAVE working group are
   Scenario 2, "the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network" and Scenario 6,
   "an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network"
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  A difficulty with these scenario
   is that one IPv4 address is consumed for every IPv6 server, using a
   1:1 mapping.  This 1:1 mapping can be economized by temporarily
   mapping an IPv4 address to an IPv6 address
   [RFC2766][I-D.perkins-sourceipnat].  However, such economizing can
   cause some IPv6 hosts to be inaccessible when all of the available
   IPv4 addresses are temporarily in the process of completing their
   flow assignments, even though many different IPv6 destinations remain
   typically available at each IPv4 address via flow assignments that
   have already been completed.

   To avoid this problem, the mechanism described in this paper solves
   the problem only for HTTP initiated from the IPv4 network towards the
   IPv6 network, and uses features of HTTP to provide access to the HTTP
   server.

   The mechanism described in this paper requires at least one IPv4 TCP
   port be routed to the IPv6 host's HTTP server.  This is possible with
   stateful NAT64 translation (with a configured static mapping),
   stateless NAT64 translation, and port- mapped stateless NAT64
   translation.


2.  Operation

   Two approaches are proposed.  The approaches can be deployed at the
   same time on the same network, and appear different to the users of
   typical web browsers.

2.1.  Approch 1: HTTP Relay

   The simpliest method is to perform an HTTP relay function, similar to
   a reverse HTTP proxy.  The relay would listen for incoming HTTP
   requests, for many FQDNs, on the IPv4 network.  Using HTTP's "host:"
   header it would relay the HTTP request to the appropriate host on the
   IPv6 network.

   The first few steps, where the in-home PC communicates with the HTTP
   relay, are out of scope of this paper.  This might be done via a
   customer portal web page, for example.

             Figure 1: HTTP Proxy, IPv4 client to IPv6 server

   Notes:

   o  A drawback of this method is that all HTTP traffic goes through
      the HTTP relay.  This approach is constrained by the HTTP relay's
      bandwidth, packets per second, and maximum number of sessions.

   o  The HTTP relay can be operated by anyone on the Internet,
      including the ISP providing access service.

2.2.  Approach 2: Redirection

   To avoid the costs of TCP relaying, the service provider can also
   provide HTTP redirection.  The HTTP redirector uses the HTTP "host:"
   header and its knowledge of the static IPv4/IPv6 mapping in the 6/4
   NAT to respond with an HTTP redirect message containing a Location
   header pointing to the IPv4 address and port that maps to the
   requested IPv6 host.  If the HTTP client indicated it supports
   HTTP/1.1, a 307 redirect SHOULD be used; for HTTP/1.0, a 302 redirect
   SHOULD be used.

   Compared with the previous approach, only the initial HTTP
   transaction occurs with the HTTP redirector.  Subsequent HTTP traffic
   is through the 6/4 NAT itself.  Because the HTTP redirection can be
   to a specific port, approximately 64K IPv6 hosts can be served in
   this manner.  However, the redirection changes the web browser's

   address bar, which can make this approach unappealing; see also
   Section 2.2.1.

   The first few steps, where the in-home PC communicates with the 6/4
   NAT to acquire a permanent mapping and communicates this mapping to
   the HTTP redirector, are out of scope of this paper.  Some 6/4
   translation mechanisms would not require that step (e.g., port-mapped
   stateless translation).  These steps might be done with a customer
   portal web page, for example.

          Figure 2: HTTP Redirection, IPv4 client to IPv6 server

   Notes:

   o  The most optimal performance is obtained if the HTTP clients
      support HTTP/1.1 persistent connections and the in-home HTTP
      server uses relative URIs.  In this way, the TCP connection from
      the HTTP client to HTTP server only hits the HTTP redirector once.

   o  The HTTP redirector can be operated by anyone on the Internet,
      including the ISP providing access service.

2.2.1.  User Experience Considerations

   A drawback of redirection is the URL displayed in the address bar
   changes.  It can reduce the professional appearance of a website to
   have the URL displayed in the browser re-written to include a port
   number or a name associated with the ISP's 6/4 translater, rather
   than a pretty domain name.  It is possible to obscure this
   redirection from most web browsers using frames.

   For example, the following frame redirects the user to a long URI
   without changing the URI seen on the address bar of most browsers:

     <html><head>
     <frameset>
     <frame src="http://www.example.com.isp.net:12345/index.html">
     </frameset>
     </head></html>


3.  Security Considerations

   Logging on the HTTP server works differently if the HTTP connection
   is relayedSection 2.1, because all connections appear to come from
   the ISP's HTTP relay device.  The IP address of the original client
   could be conveyed using the de facto standard X-Forwarded-For [XFF]
   header.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA action.


5.  Acknowledgements

   The mechanism described in this draft is based on existing "web
   redirection" services provided by a number of services on the
   Internet (e.g., [DynDNS]), extended to describe similar operation
   with IPv4/IPv6 translators.

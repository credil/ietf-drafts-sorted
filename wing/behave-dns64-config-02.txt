Abstract

   Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and
   IPv6-only hosts at the same time.  Such networks also want to IPv6/
   IPv4 translation for the IPv6-only host so it can access servers on
   the IPv4 Internet.  On such a network, the synthesized AAAA responses
   from a DNS64 can cause traffic to be translated.  This document
   describes and analyzes several solutions to avoid that translation.

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts     February 2010


1.  Introduction

   In order to access IPv4 servers, an IPv6-only host needs to use an
   IPv6/IPv4 translator.  Typically, the IPv6-only host performs a DNS
   query to a DNS64 recursive resolver, which synthesizes an AAAA when
   necessary.  However, if a dual-stack host uses that same DNS64
   recursive resolver and normal address selection rules [RFC3484], the
   dual-stack host will send traffic through the IPv6/IPv4 translator
   when such traffic could have been sent using IPv4.  Thus, as an
   optimization, it is desirable that a dual-stack host avoid IPv6/IPv4
   translation.

   Note:  If the dual-stack host's IPv4 traffic is being NATted the
   difference is NAT44 versus NAT64, so the performance and scalability
   concern is nearly identical.  However, at least one application
   breaks when translated between IP address families unless special
   measures are taken [I-D.ietf-behave-ftp64].  The IETF should decide
   if it is worthwhile to avoid NAT64 for dual-stack hosts that are
   connected to a network operating a DNS64.

      Note:  Windows XP can only be configured with IPv4 DNS servers
      [XP-DNS].  This means a Windows XP host is always dual-stack and
      requires an IPv4 address in order to send its DNS queries.  While
      it is possible to work around this issue by running BIND on the
      Windows XP device itself, this is complex.  Thus, Windows XP
      should not be considered a viable operating system to join an
      IPv6-only network.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "IPv4-only" means a host that has only IPv4 address(es) assigned to
   its interface(s).  "Dual-stack" means a host that has an IPv4 address
   and an IPv6 address assigned to its interface(es).  "IPv6-only" means
   a host that has only IPv6 address(es) assigned to its interface(s).


3.  Procedures to support IPv6-only and dual-stack hosts with DNS64

   Several solutions are discussed in this section, in roughly the order
   of preference (as determined by the author).

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts     February 2010


3.1.  IPv4-Mapped Address for 'normal' DNS server

   It has been observed that some common operating systems, when
   configured as dual-stack, will successfully use an IPv4-mapped
   address (and send an IPv4 packet).  But when configured as IPv6-only,
   they will not successfully use an IPv4-mapped address (because they
   lack an IPv4 address) [experiment].

   We could take advantage of this by configuring the 'normal' DNS
   server using an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address (that is, an IPv6 address
   starting with ::ffff:/96), and configuring the DNS64 server using a
   normal IPv6 address.

   Because [RFC3646] says the DNS servers are used in the order listed,
   a dual-stack host will use the 'normal' DNS server and an IPv6-only
   host will be unable to use that 'normal' DNS server and will use the
   next server on its list.

      Note:  Non-compliant IPv6 stacks might send a packet to the IPv4-
      mapped IPv6 address (::ffff:c000:0201, using the example below).
      To deal with such non-compliant IPv6 implementations the network
      can filter (drop) traffic to that IPv6 address.

   For example, a dual-stack host and an IPv6-only host would be
   configured with the following DNS servers, in this order:

     ::ffff:192.0.2.1       # 'normal' DNS server (usable only by
                              dual-stack host.  Not usable by IPv6-only
                              host)
     2001:0DB8:DDDD::1234   # DNS64 server

3.1.1.  Host Transition

   When transitioning from dual-stack to IPv6-only, nothing needs to
   occur - the higher-priority DNS server (with the IPv4-mapped IPv6
   address) will become inaccessible and the DNS client will failover to
   the next-higher priority DNS server (which is the DNS64 server).

   When transitioning from IPv6-only to dual-stack, nothing
   automatically causes the host to start querying the 'normal' DNS
   server.  Thus, a host that transitions from IPv6-only to dual-stack
   will continue to query the DNS64 until the host's stack re-
   initializes.

3.1.2.  Advantages and Disadvantages

   Advantages:

   o  No change to hosts.

   o  On Linux systems, is not effective if the sysctl
      net.ipv6.bindv6only is set, as this causes dual-stack systems to
      not send packets to IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

   Disadvantages:

   o  Seems confusing to configure.

   o  Can we rely on IPv6-only hosts allowing IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
      to be configured as their DNS servers?

3.2.  Disable DNS64 Functions in DNS Query

   A dual-stack host does not need synthesized AAAA records, and does
   not need to use the network's NAT64.  So, a dual-stack host could
   send a DNS query to a DNS64 requesting no synthesized AAAA records.
   This allows both dual-stack and IPv6-only hosts to be configured with
   a DNS64.

   To request no AAAA synthesis, the DNS query sets both the DO bit ("I
   understand DNSSEC") and the CD bit ("I will do DNSSEC validation").
   When the DNS64 receives a query with those bits set, it does not
   synthesize an AAAA response (because doing so would break DNSSEC
   validation).

3.2.1.  Host Transition

   If host transitions from dual-stack to IPv6-only, it would need to
   perform its own DNS64 function (which requires it know the prefix of
   its NAT64) or would have to not set the DO and CD bits in DNS
   queries.  Likewise, if a host transitions from IPv6-only to dual-
   stack, it needs to know to start sending DNS queries with the DO and
   CD bits set.s

3.2.2.  Advantages and Disadvantages

   Advantages:

   o  Simple

   Disadvantages:

   o  Requires dual-stack host support DNSSEC validation.

   o  Requires host support Section 3.2.1.

   o  There are security implications if the DNS client is lying and is
      not, in fact, going to perform its own DNSSEC validation.

3.3.  New DHCP option for 'normal' DNS server

   Another approach, which requires modification of dual-stack hosts
   which want to avoid the DNS64, is to introduce a new DHCP option.

   This approach feels a little backwards at first.  The idea is to
   support unmodified hosts (which might be dual-stack but might be
   IPv6-only) by placing DNS64 servers into the normal DHCPv6 option for
   DNS servers [RFC3646].  Then, place the 'normal' DNS servers into a
   *new* DHCPv6 option.

3.3.1.  Host Transition

   TBD.

3.3.2.  Advantages and Disadvantages

   Disadvantages:

   o  If dual-stack hosts want to avoid NAT64, they need to be modified
      to understand this new DHCP option.  If they aren't modified, they
      will use NAT64.

3.4.  Modify Host's Address Selection Rules

   The default address selection rules [RFC3484] prefer IPv6 over IPv4.
   This means, for a dual-stack host, that IPv6 will be preferred (if
   available) over IPv4.  If a dual-stack host is configured to use a
   DNS64 server, that DNS64 server will synthesize an AAAA response if
   there is an A record.  Thus, the dual-stack host will always use IPv6
   if a DNS lookup was involved, even if IPv4 could have been used more
   optimally.

      Note:  If both a NAT44 and NAT64 are deployed on the same network,
      roughly the same inefficiency occurs (that is, NAT state is
      created).  However, it is generally considered better to perform
      NAT44 than NAT64, because NAT64 translates between IP address
      families which can have side effects (e.g., FTP).

   To avoid this, the host's default address selection rules [RFC3484]
   can be modified so that IPv4 is preferred over the IPv6/IPv4
   translator's prefix.  At the same time, native IPv6 can still be
   preferred over IPv4.  This is accomplished by adding the network's
   IPv6/IPv4 translator's prefix as the lowest Precedence in the address
   selection rules.

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts     February 2010


   If the IPv6/IPv4 translator's prefix is the IANA-assigned well-known
   prefix (64:FF9B::/96, as assigned in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]), this can be hard-coded or easily
   scripted into the system startup.  However, if the IPv6/IPv4
   translator's prefix is a network-specific prefix (NSP, as described
   in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]), the default address selection
   rules can be modified only after the host learns its currently-
   connected network's IPv6/IPv4 translator's prefix (e.g., using
   [I-D.wing-behave-learn-prefix]).

   On some operating systems, the address selection rules can be
   configured using a command line utility (e.g., Windows, FreeBSD),
   without new software in the host's IP stack.  Other operating systems
   are not as accommodating of this solution (see Section 3.4.2).

      Note:  it may be desirable to create a standard to adjust a host's
      address selection rules based on the translator's prefix.  This is
      a topic for the IPv6 maintenance working group [6man].  This
      automatic mechanism may involve modifications to the host's IP
      stack, depending on how the IETF chooses to standardize such a
      mechanism.  FOR EXAMPLE, it may be useful to consider
      [I-D.wing-behave-learn-prefix] (which proposes using either DNS or
      DHCPv6) in conjunction with adjusting the host's address selection
      rules.

3.4.1.  Host Transition

   An IPv6-only and a dual-stack host can both be configured with the
   same address selection rules (namely, both can add the network's
   translator as the lowest Precedence).  This is because the IPv6-only
   host will never use IPv4 (because it lacks an IPv4 address) and will
   thus fall through and use the IPv6 address synthesized by the DNS64
   containing the IPv6/IPv4 translator's prefix (that is, as shown in
   the examples, the IPv6-only host will use the Precedence 3 entry in
   the default policy table).  The dual-stack host, if it receives an
   AAAA response, will prefer use IPv6; if it receives only an A
   response, it will prefer to use IPv4 (using Precedence 10 for IPv4-
   mapped addresses defined in Section 2.5.4 of [RFC2373]).

3.4.2.  Limitations and Advantages

   The following limitations are observed:

   o  OSX does not implement a [RFC3484] or [RFC3484]-like policy table.

   o  Some applications implement their own address selection rules,
      effectively ignoring the OS's address selection rules.

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts     February 2010


   The following advantages are observed:

   o  Causes IPv4 to be preferred over IPv6/IPv4 translator addresses,
      even if DNS was not used to obtain the IPv4 or IPv6 address (e.g.,
      applications which do not use DNS).

3.4.3.  Examples

   For example, if a network is using the WKP 64:FF9B::/96
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] and a host is using the new default
   policy table from [I-D.arifumi-6man-rfc3484-revise] (which added
   Precedence 5 for Teredo), the host's new policy table would contain
   one new entry with Precedence 3, as shown below:

        Prefix        Precedence Label
        ::1/128               50     0     # localhost
        ::/0                  30     2     # IPv6 native
        2002::/16             20     3     # 6to4
        ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4     # IPv4-mapped
        2001::/32              5     5     # Teredo
        64:FF9B::/96           3     6     # 6/4 translator's prefix

   As another example, if a network has the prefix 2001:0DB8::/32 and
   the NAT64 is using the Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) 2001:0DB8:
   AAAA::/96, and the host is using the new default policy table from
   [I-D.arifumi-6man-rfc3484-revise] (which added Precedence 5 for
   Teredo), the host's new policy table would contain one new entry with
   Precedence 3, as shown below:

        Prefix        Precedence Label
        ::1/128               50     0     # localhost
        ::/0                  30     2     # IPv6 native
        2002::/16             20     3     # 6to4
        ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4     # IPv4-mapped
        2001::/32              5     5     # Teredo
        2001:0DB8:AAAA::/96    3     6     # 6/4 translator's prefix

3.5.  Use DHCP to Assign Appropriate DNS Server

      Note:  due to the limitations of this solution (see
      Section 3.5.5), it may have little or no value.

   To avoid unnecessary traffic through a translator, it is desirable to
   configure IPv4-only and dual-stack hosts with a 'normal' DNS
   recursive resolver.

   However, it is necessary to configure IPv6-only hosts with a DNS64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] recursive resolver so those hosts can use an

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts     February 2010


   IPv6/IPv4 translator and access servers on the IPv4 Internet.

   It is difficult to provide different DNS servers to those types of
   hosts, because there is no existing protocol that declares a host is
   IPv4-only, dual-stack, or IPv6-only.

   This document describes how a network's DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers,
   combined with a client-identifiers [RFC4361] chosen by the host, can
   determine if a host is IPv4-only, dual-stack, or IPv6-only, and
   assign the correct DNS server according to that determination.

      Note:  the DHCP mechanism described in this section have some
      overlap with the Multiple Interfaces Working Group [mif] and with
      split-zone DNS [I-D.savolainen-mif-dns-server-selection].

   Both an IPv4-only host and a dual-stack host obtain an IPv4 network
   address.  Today, hosts most commonly obtain an IPv4 address using
   DHCPv4 [RFC2131].  An IPv6-only host does not obtain an IPv4 address;
   however, it may be using DHCPv6 to obtain other information (e.g.,
   NTP servers).  The following procedure takes advantage of that
   difference to determine if a host is IPv4-only, dual-stack, or IPv6-
   only.

3.5.1.  Host Requirements

   The host has the following requirements:

   1.  if the host uses IPv4, it MUST use DHCPv4 to learn its IPv4
       address and its DNS server address(es); and,

   2.  if the host uses IPv6, it MUST use DHCPv6 to learn its IPv6 DNS
       resolver, using the Information-Request message described in
       Section 18.1.5 of [RFC3315] and using [RFC3646]; and,

   3.  the host MUST use client-identifiers [RFC4361] to identify itself
       to its DHCP server(s), and MUST use the same client-identifier
       for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6

          Note:  This last requirement is stronger than the SHOULD in
          Section 6.2 of [RFC4361]

       If the host does not support DHCP authentication, and acquires/
       releases its IPv4 address while keeping its IPv6 address, it MUST
       support the procedure described in Section 3.5.4; and,

3.5.2.  DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 Server Requirements

   The DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers have the following requirements:

   1.  the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers MUST be able to communicate with
       each other both client-identifiers [RFC4361] and if an IPv4
       address is assigned to that client-identifier; and,

   2.  If the DHCP server and the host support DHCP authentication, the
       DHCP server MUST support the procedure described in
       Section 3.5.4.

   3.  MUST support the DHCP Information Refresh Time Option [RFC4242].

3.5.3.  DHCP Server Operation

   If the DHCP server first receives a DHCPv4 request for a particular
   client-identifier, it responds with the 'normal' DNS resolver.  The
   DHCPv6 server remembers that RFC4361 client identity and if the
   DHCPv6 server sees a DHCPv6 request from that same client identity,
   it responds to the DHCPv6 request with a 'normal' DNS resolver.

   If the DHCP server first receives a DHCPv6 request for a particular
   client-identifier, it responds with a short information refresh time
   [RFC4242] (e.g., 30 seconds) and a DNS64 recursive resolver.

      Note-1:  This means that during the short information refresh
      time, both a dual-stack host and an IPv6-only will have their DNS
      queries processed by the DNS64 recursive resolver.  During that
      time, both the dual-stack host and the IPv6-only host will get
      connectivity to IPv4 servers, but the dual-stack host will use the
      IPv6/IPv4 translator until the information refresh time expires.

      Note-2:  for discussion:  Consider have DHCP server slightly delay
      (e.g., 100ms) responding to a DHCPv6 request.  This gives a chance
      for the DHCPv4 request to be received, thus avoiding the issue
      described in Note-1.

   After the short information refresh time, the DHCPv6 client will send
   a new request.  By that time, the DHCPv6 server will have either:

   a.  have seen a DHCPv4 request from the same RFC4361 host.  This
       indicates the host supports dual-stack.  The DHCP server should
       extend the DHCPv6 lease, and provide a 'normal' DNS server
       (instead of the DNS64 server).

   b.  have not seen a DHCPv4 request from the same RFC4361 host.  This
       indicates the host is IPv6-only.  The DHCP server should extend

       the DHCPv6 lease and continue providing the same DNS64 server.

3.5.4.  Host Transition

   During natural evolution of a network or because of debugging/
   troubleshooting, a host might transition between IPv4-only, dual-
   stack, or IPv6-only.  When the host acquires or releases its IPv4
   address it transitions to needing a different DNS server; if the host
   has an IPv4 address, it needs a 'normal' DNS server and if it does
   not have an IPv4 address it needs a DNS64 server.

   There are two transitions considered, where the host transitions:

   1.  from IPv6-only to IPv4-supporting (that is, IPv4-only or dual-
       stack),

   2.  from IPv4-supporting (that is, IPv4-only or dual-stack) to IPv6-
       only.

   When doing (1), the DHCPv4 server will provide a 'normal' DNS server
   (because the DHCPv4 server sees the same client-identifier as seen by
   the DHCPv6 server).  So case (1) is solved.

   However, when doing (2), the host is giving up its IPv4 address and
   is currently using a normal DNS server, but needs to be told to use a
   DNS64 server instead.  There are two mechanisms to provide that
   function, based on the network and host's support of DHCP
   authentication (Section 19.1.1 of [RFC3315])

   1.  with DHCP authentication:  When a certain client identifier loses
       or acquires its IPv4 address and also has an IPv6 address, the
       DHCPv6 server MUST send a DHCP RECONFIGURE message [RFC3315] to
       the host and SHOULD include the Option Request option indicating
       the DNS server information has changed.  The RECONFIGURE message
       triggers the host to send a new Information-Request message to
       the DHCPv6 server.

   2.  without DHCP authentication:  the host, when keeping its IPv6
       address and releasing its IPv4 address, MUST also issue a new
       DHCPv6 Information-Request message to the DHCPv6 server.

   In both cases, the Information-Request message causes the DHCPv6
   server to reply with a DNS64 recursive resolver, as discussed in
   Section 3.5.2.

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts     February 2010


3.5.5.  Advantages and Disadvantages

   Advantages:

   o  Dual-stack applications, which perform DNS lookups, will
      effectively avoid NAT64 when using the 'normal' DNS server.

   Disadvantages:

   o  A network with mixed IPv4-only/dual-stack hosts and IPv6-only
      hosts needs to have a mix of DNS configurations for those hosts.
      Thus, mechanisms that advertise the same DNS servers to all hosts
      cannot be used on such networks (e.g., IPv6 router
      advertisements).

   o  If separate networks operate DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 (e.g., as with
      Dual-Stack Lite where the ISP operates DHCPv4 and the customer
      premise router operates DHCPv6), it is likely impossible for the
      DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers to communicate necessary information
      with each other.

   o  Windows does not support [RFC4361].

   o  OSX does not support DHCPv6.

3.6.  New DHCP option for DNS64 server

   Another approach, which requires modification of IPv6-only hosts
   which need to use the DNS64, is to introduce a new DHCP option.

   The idea is to support unmodified dual-stack hosts (which use the
   normal DNS server provided via [RFC3646]), but to modify IPv6-only
   hosts to look for the DNS64 server in a newly-defined DHCPv6 option.

3.6.1.  Advantages and Disadvantages

   Disadvantages:

   o  Requires modifying IPv6-only hosts, and without this modification
      they won't work at all with a DNS64.


4.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

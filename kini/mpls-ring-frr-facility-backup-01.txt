Abstract          

   Fast Re-route (FRR) using facility backup is a widely deployed MPLS
   protection mechanism that can protect against link and node failure.
   It provides a fast protection switch mechanism to minimize traffic
   loss (typically sub 50msec) if the node that detects the failure
   locally, does the repair by re-routing the protected traffic to go
   over the backup tunnel. A direct application of this mechanism to a
   ring topology results in an inefficient use of link bandwidth that
   could also result in degraded service. This document describes a
   mechanism to do it without such problems.

1.  Introduction

   Fast Re-route for TE tunnels [MPLS-FRR] is widely used to realize sub
   50msec protection of traffic in case of link or node failure.
   Specifically, the facility backup method described in [MPLS-FRR]
   provides a scalable mechanism to protect a large number of LSPs in
   sub 50msec. When applied to a ring topology this results in an in-
   efficient use of bandwidth and also leads to degraded service. This
   is described in detail with a sample topology/scenario in section 3.
   A solution that extends the facility backup method of [MPLS-FRR] is
   described in section 4. An explanation of the solution by applying it
   to the topology/scenario in the problem statement is provided in
   section 5.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALLNOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   PLR-u - Point of Local Repair (PLR) Upstream. A PLR that is upstream
   along the protected LSP from the point of failure. This must be used
   in the context of a technique that conveys failure quickly from the
   failure point to the PLR-u so that the overall traffic loss is
   comparable to local repair adjacent to the failure.

   Path Backup Tunnel - A backup tunnel that can be used to protect many
   LSPs where each LSP traverses a path through the head-end and the
   tail-end of the path backup tunnel going through one or more
   intermediate facilities and LSRs. A path bypass tunnel is also a
   backup tunnel that bypasses a subset of the path of the protected
   LSP. It is also a backup path.

   Efficient-path backup tunnel - A path backup tunnel that improves the
   efficiency of backup tunnels that bypass a portion of the path that
   it bypasses. This is also referred to as e-backup tunnel.

              Figure 1 Facility bypass in a Ring topology

   The issue with backup tunnel in a ring topology is illustrated
   through the example in Figure 1. L1-10 are LSRs in a ring topology
   and say each link in the ring has 1G bandwidth. To protect the
   facility L8-L7, a uni-directional backup tunnel B1 is routed along
   L8-L9-L10-L1-L2-L3-L4-L5-L6-L7 with L8 as PLR and L7 as MP.
   Similarly, a uni-directional backup tunnel B2 is routed along L7-L6-
   L5-L4-L3-L2-L1-L10-L9-L8 with L7 as PLR and L8 as MP. A protected LSP
   P1 is routed along L9-L8-L7-L6 and has a bandwidth constraint of
   0.6G. Another uni-directional protected LSP P2 is routed along L6-L7-
   L8-L9 and has bandwidth constraint of 0.6G.

   When facility L8-L7 fails, P1 is protection switched over B1 at PLR
   L8 and P2 over B2 at PLR L7, thereby bypassing the failed
   resource/facility. Since the aggregate bandwidth requirement on L8-
   >L9 becomes 1.2G (0.6G for P1 + 0.6G for B2), both P1 and P2 start
   experiencing degraded service. If there are other uni-directional
   protected LSPs e.g. P3 along the path L10-L9-L8-L7-L6, P4 along the
   path L8-L9, etc, they would also start experiencing degraded service.
   Even when P1 needs bandwidth less than 0.5G, the wraparound consumes
   bandwidth that would be better used by other LSPs such as P4.

   Note that similar issues would arise if (P1, P2) was a single bi-
   directional protected LSP and/or (B1, B2) was a single bi-directional
   bypass tunnel.

4.  Solution

   To solve the problem described above it is required to switch the
   traffic from the protected LSP to a backup tunnel that does not U-

   turn overlap the protected LSP. This traffic switchover MUST be
   realized with timing characteristics similar to methods that execute
   local repair adjacent to the point of failure. 

   To achieve this, an additional e-backup tunnel is proposed to be
   setup for any backup tunnel whose route is U-turn overlapping an LSP
   that it is protecting. Note that the e-backup tunnel would have its
   head-end and tail-end on the protected LSP. To switchover the traffic
   from the protected LSP to the e-backup tunnel with timing
   characteristics similar to a local repair method performed at a node
   adjacent to the failure, the head-end of the e-backup tunnel MUST
   receive the trigger within a very short duration after of failure. A
   simple and fast method to propagate the failed condition via the
   backup tunnel is proposed in section 4.2. It requires the head-end of
   the e-backup tunnel to be on the backup tunnel. The following
   criteria must be used to route the e-backup tunnel so that efficiency
   is realized:

      1. The head-end of the e-backup tunnel SHOULD be at an LSR that is
         upstream (on the protected LSP) of the PLR where the protected
         LSP and the backup tunnel stop U-turn overlapping. In some
         scenarios it is possible that such an LSR may lack the
         functionality described in this draft. In such a case an LSR
         that has this functionality and is furthest upstream from the
         PLR but not beyond the LSR where the protected and the backup
         tunnel stop overlapping should be chosen to achieve the maximal
         efficiency. Since the head-end of the e-backup tunnel performs
         a repair by routing traffic from the protected LSP to the e-
         backup tunnel it is referred to as Point of Local Repair
         Upstream (PLR-u). The details of receiving a trigger and
         performing the protection switch are described in section 4.4. 

      2. The e-backup tunnel should be routed along the backup tunnel so
         that it can share reservation with the backup tunnel. It could
         also be routed along another path as long as resources are
         available and it satisfies the protection constraints of the
         protected LSP.

      3. The tail-end of the e-backup tunnel SHOULD be at an LSR that is
         downstream (on the protected LSP) of the MP where the protected
         LSP and the backup LSP stop overlapping. The merge action at
         the tail-end is the same as described in [MPLS-FRR] for any
         backup tunnel. This document does not describe any additional
         procedures for the tail-end of the e-backup tunnel.

   Similar to a backup tunnel, an e-backup tunnel may be setup in
   advance or at the time a protected LSP is setup. An e-backup tunnel
   can make efficient the FRR of more than one backup tunnel. In a

   typical case an e-backup tunnel will make efficient the FRR for many
   NHOP Bypass Tunnels along the path that an e-backup tunnel would
   bypass. The following associations MUST be known in advance to setup
   the protection switch actions:

      1. The e-backup tunnel and the protected LSP.

      2. The e-backup tunnel and the backup tunnel whose FRR it is
         making efficient.

   If the protected LSP is setup via RSVP-TE then these associations can
   be signaled by the extensions defined in section 4.1. 

4.1.  RSVP-TE signaling extensions

   To enable e-backup path computation, the information about the backup
   tunnel is needed at LSRs that are upstream of the PLR. The RRO is
   used to record this information. This additional information is
   requested using the "Session Attribute" object as described in
   section 4.1.1. The information in the RRO is described in 4.1.2. 

4.1.1.  Session Attribute Object Flag: Local_protection_recording

   A new flag "Local protection recording desired" is defined for the
   "Flags" field in the Session Attribute object. This flag indicates
   that information about the local protection used should be included
   when doing a route record.

4.1.2.  RRO subobjects

   A new RRO subobject called "Backup Session" subobject is defined. It
   follows an IPv4/IPv6 address sub-object (that would have "Local
   Protection Available" set). This subobject describes the backup LSP
   that protects against a failure detected at the interface
   corresponding to the preceding IPv4/IPv6 address sub-object. This
   subobject is carried in the RRO of a protected LSP. The encoding of
   this subobject is described in section 4.1.2.1. 

   A new RRO subobject called "Backup Sender Template" subobject is
   defined. It follows the "Backup Session" subobject and is included
   only if the "Backup Session" subobject does not uniquely identify the
   backup LSP. The encoding of this subobject is described in section
   section 4.1.2.2.

4.2.  Triggering protection switch at PLR-u

   Any LSR along the backup tunnel may be the head-end of an associated
   e-backup tunnel. Hence all the LSRs along a backup tunnel must be
   alerted immediately when a failure is detected at PLR. It is required
   to convey this failure information from the PLR instantaneously
   (except being gated by propagation delays) for the timing
   characteristics to be similar to methods that execute local repair
   adjacent to the point of failure. This document proposes using the
   alert mechanism in [ID.fast-lsp-alert] to convey the trigger message.

   A message format that can be implemented in hardware/firmware is
   required since the trigger should be generated and processed as
   quickly as possible to reduce traffic loss. Typically,
   implementations of [ID.BFD] fit these requirements. Hence the
   mechanism in [ID.BFD-MPLS] operating in the G-ACh ([RFC5586]) of the
   backup tunnel is proposed with an extension to signal that protection
   switch has occurred at PLR.

   A new BFD control packet diagnostic (Diag) code "Backup LSP not
   carrying protected traffic" is defined. It is applicable even if the
   "State" of the BFD session is "Up". A transit LSR along the backup
   tunnel may choose to ignore validating the "Authentication" section
   of the BFD control packet received via this alert mechanism for that
   backup since the end point would do the authentication and that would
   be sufficient to authenticate the BFD session. Similar reasoning
   holds true for any validation of ACH TLVs (some of them are listed in
   [ID.ACH-TLVs]). Also, a transit LSP along the backup tunnel that is
   not an upstream LSR for any of the protected LSPs, simply ignores
   this BFD message for local processing.

4.3.  Procedures at PLR

   A PLR runs a BFD session on the backup tunnel's G-ACh. When the BFD
   session is Up, it signals the association of the protected LSPs with
   that backup tunnel by updating the RRO of the protected LSP as
   described in section 4.1. 

   While the protection switch has not occurred at PLR and the BFD
   session in Up, the "Diagnostic" field in the BFD control packet is
   set to "Backup LSP not carrying protected traffic". When the PLR
   switches the protected LSP the backup tunnel, the value "Backup LSP
   not carrying protected traffic" is not used anymore in the
   "Diagnostic" field.

   The PLR sends the BFD Control packets on the backup tunnel in a way
   that all LSRs along the backup tunnel are alerted with the BFD
   message. To do this it uses the mechanism described [ID.fast-lsp-

   alert] i.e., the BFD packet is sent with TTL=1 in the LSP label, GAL
   TTL=255 and the FLA-bit set. The PLR may choose to not use this alert
   mechanism for every BFD control packet. In that case, the alert
   mechanism must be set for a period of at least the BFD "Detection
   Time" when any of the following events occur:

      1. The association of a protected LSP with this backup tunnel is
         setup or deleted.

      2. A protection switch or revert action occurs for a protected LSP
         to the backup (at PLR).

      3. The backup tunnel is re-routed (typically with Make-before
         break or MBB).

   The BFD transmit timer must be treated as if it expired as soon as
   any of the above events occur. Additionally, to recover from packet
   loss, the BFD control packet (with the LSP alert mechanism) should be
   sent a couple more times within a very short duration (typically 10
   milliseconds). Under stable conditions the PLR should send BFD packet
   with the alert mechanism enabled at a much lower frequency. It is
   recommended that this frequency be once every 100 * "Detection Time".

4.4.  Procedures at PLR-u

   An upstream LSR on the protected LSP that is a transit for the backup
   tunnel routed in a direction opposite to the protected LSP, deduces
   the association between the protected LSP and the backup tunnel when
   processing the protected LSP's RRO. Such a LSR is a PLR-u and it
   creates an e-backup LSP (if one does not already exist) to a
   destination LSR as has been described earlier. 

   The PLR-u associates a protection switch action of re-routing the
   protected LSP to the e-backup tunnel with a trigger. The trigger is
   an alert message received on the backup tunnel indicating that the
   PLR has done a protection switch action (as a result of locally
   detecting a failure) and re-routed the protected LSP to the backup
   tunnel.

   The PLR-u's protection switch action depends on the current status of
   the protection switch at PLR-u and the status of the protection
   switch at the PLR (known through the alert message on the backup
   tunnel). When the protection switch status at PLR-u is in-active
   i.e., the protected LSP is not re-routed to the e-backup tunnel, and
   the received alert message indicates that protection switch has
   occurred at PLR i.e., the BFD packet received as an alert message on
   the backup tunnel has Status as Up and the Diagnostic code is not
   "Backup LSP not carrying protected traffic", then the PLR-u re-routes

   traffic on the protected LSP over the e-backup tunnel. In all other
   conditions the protected LSP is not re-routed over the e-backup LSP.

5.  Example

   Consider the scenario described in section 3. PLR (L8) creates a BFD
   session on B1. When the BFD session is Up, L8 appends to the RRO of
   P1, P3, P4, P5 the backup LSP Tunnel Session (of B1) subobject
   following the interface address of the link L8->L7. L9 on
   interpreting this subobject for P1 and also that the corresponding
   LSP (B1) is going in the opposite direction as P1, functions as PLR-u
   for P1. Using the RROs of B1, P1 and the TED, it deduces that a
   backup path L9-L10-L1-L2-L3-L4-L5-L6 can be used to protect P1. Say
   this LSP is called B3. L9 initiates a setup of B3 if it does not
   already exist and associates the trigger of an alert message on B1 to
   perform the protection switch from P1 to B3. Normally PLR-u (L9)
   receives a BFD control packet with FLA-bit set on the backup tunnel
   with "State" as "Up" and the "Diagnostic" code as "Backup LSP not
   carrying protected traffic".

   Say L8 does not set FLA-bit on all BFD control packets on the bypass.
   When L8 detects failure on link L8-L7 (due to loss of signal, BFD,
   etc), it does a protection switch of P1 to the bypass B1. It also
   modifies the BFD control packet for the session on B1, by clearing
   the "Diagnostic" code. The FLA-bit for the session is set for a short
   time. When PLR-u (L9) receives the G-Ach message due to FLA-bit being
   set, it processes the embedded BFD control packet. Since "State" is
   "Up" and the "Diagnostic" code is clear, L9 does a protection switch
   of P1 to B3. Conversely when the fault on L8-L7 clears, L8 switches
   traffic on P1 out of the bypass and sends it directly to L7. It also
   modifies the BFD control packet for the session on B1, by setting the
   "Diagnostic" code to "Backup LSP not carrying protected traffic". The
   FLA-bit for the session is set for a short time. Again PLR-u (L9)
   receives the G-Ach message and processes the embedded BFD control
   packet. Since "State" is "Up" and the "Diagnostic" code is "Backup
   LSP not carrying protected traffic", L9 reverts P1 by sending traffic
   directly to L8 instead of the backup path.

6.  Applicability to generic topologies

   This document uses a ring topology in isolation, purely for
   illustrative clarity purposes. Any backup tunnel along with the
   segment that it is protecting, forms a logical ring. This sub-graph
   can be placed in any generic topology. This problem and solution
   would still be equally applicable.

7.  Future work

   The solution in its current form is applicable to point-to-point
   protected LSPs. However the problem applies to point-to-multipoint
   LSPs as well and a solution could follow a similar approach.
   Solutions to P2MP LSPs would be incorporated in future versions of
   this draft.

   Authentication parameters required by [ID.BFD] or the ACH TLVs, need
   to be communicated to all LSRs along the backup if it required to do
   authentication at each transit LSR. This can be simplified by
   extensions to [RSVP-TE].

8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security considerations other
   than those already described in [MPLS-FRR], [ID.BFD] and [ID.fast-
   lsp-alert]. The optimization (optional) of not validating the
   authenticity of the BFD control packet (via authentication field or
   ACH TLVs) in a transit LSR of the backup tunnel should not introduce
   any new security threats. Note that this message is processed only
   when the "State" in the BFD control packet indicates Up. Any non-
   authentic packets would be detected by the LSRs at the LSP's end-
   points. Alarms would be raised by the end point and should be
   sufficient to diagnose potential problems.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Values need to be allocated for:

      1. "Flags" field position in SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object for newly
         defined flag "Local protection recording desired". Recommend
         using next unused field position 0x20.

      2. "Type" field in RECORD_ROUTE object with C-Type 1 for newly
         defined subobjects Backup_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4_Session,
         Backup_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6_Session,
         Backup_LSP_Tunnel_IPv4_Sender_Template and
         Backup_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6_Sender_Template. Recommend using values
         the next available values 4, 5, 6 and 7 respectively. 

      3. "Diagnostic" field in BFD control packet for newly defined code
         "Backup LSP not carrying protected traffic". Recommend using
         the first reserved value 9 for this purpose.

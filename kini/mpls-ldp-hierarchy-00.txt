Abstract          

   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is used to advertise mappings of
   Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs) to labels. IP prefix FECs are
   used to setup Label Switched Paths (LSPs) along routed paths. LDP
   advertises label mappings for IP Prefix FECs that appear as routes in
   the route table. As the number of FECs in the network increases the
   number of labels correspondingly increases. During certain failure
   conditions a large number of label mappings may have to be generated
   and/or installed in the data plane. In this document we describe an
   LDP extension to advertise hierarchical label mappings. This helps to
   reduce the number of label mappings that are downloaded during
   certain failure conditions and hence improves convergence times.

1.  Introduction

   Label Distribution Protocol ([LDP]) is widely deployed protocol in
   MPLS networks. However it faces limitations in fast convergence
   especially in scaled scenarios. Some of these problems are described
   in section 3. A solution to this problem is described in section 4. 

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Statement

   LDP typically allocates a unique label per FEC. Even when the FECs
   have a common egress LSR, there may be a unique label per FEC. This
   is typical when the FEC has a unique nexthop on the egress LSR and a
   FEC lookup on the egress LSR must be avoided. When the path to the
   egress LSR changes (e.g. due to link/node failures), many FTN and/or
   ILM entries need to be re-programmed to the data plane. This
   increases the convergence time.

   To deduce the association of the FEC and the egress LSR, a link-state
   IGP may be used to flood information about the FECs. However, when
   there are a large number of FECs, IGP stability and convergence are
   adversely affected. Alternately an additional protocol such as BGP
   may be used but that increases the operational cost. If targeted LDP
   is used the number of LDP sessions is of the order of the number of
   LSRs in the network and this has poor scaling properties.

4.  Solution

   The solution in this document defines a mechanism to distribute the
   mapping of a FEC to the corresponding egress LSR (along with the
   label mapping) using LDP. This label mapping is henceforth referred
   to as a hierarchical label mapping or H-Label mapping. Using this
   mapping, an LSP hierarchy is used to transport packets belonging to
   the FEC. A path to the egress is lower in the hierarchy over which an
   LSP higher in the hierarchy (specific to the FEC) is tunneled. The
   label for the LSP higher in the hierarchy is the one allocated by the
   egress LSR. When the path to an egress LSR changes and results in a
   nexthop change, only the nexthop corresponding to the path that is
   lower in the hierarchy needs to be re-programmed in the data plane.
   This speeds up convergence. Only the FECs to the egress LSR have to
   be carried in a routing protocol (e.g. link-state IGP), thus reducing
   the size of the information carried in the routing protocol and
   results in the faster routing protocol convergence. This also helps

   faster routing protocol convergence in cases where the egress LSR
   goes down.

   The new/modified TLVs, messages and procedures to realize this
   hierarchy are described in subsequent sections.

4.1.  TLV Encodings and associated procedures

4.1.1.  Hierarchical Label (H-Label) TLV

   This TLV is a type of Label TLV and can occur in any LDP message that
   can have a Label TLV as defined in [LDP]. In addition it can occur as
   an optional parameter in the Label Request message. This TLV consists
   of two optional sub-TLVs, a Generic Label TLV and a FEC TLV. The FEC
   TLV MUST have a single Address Prefix FEC Element. This FEC Element
   is henceforth referred to as Egress LSR Address. When the H-Label TLV
   occurs in the Label Mapping message it MUST have both TLVs. When the
   H-Label TLV occurs in the Label Request message it MAY not have any
   sub-TLV or have just the FEC TLV.

4.1.2.  Metric TLV

   This TLV is optional in the Label Mapping message that has an H-
   Label. The Metric is an attribute of the FEC.

   Metric Type
      1 octet unsigned integer type value. Values in the range 0x00 to
      0x0f are defined in this document. Values from 0x10 to 0xff are
      reserved for future use.

   Metric Value
      For Metric Types 0x00 to 0x0f this is a 4 byte unsigned integer
      type value. If the Metric Type is 0x0f then the Metric Value MUST
      be greater than 0. If a Metric TLV is not present in a label
      mapping message with an H-Label then the message MUST be treated
      as having Metric Type of zero and a Metric Value of zero.

4.1.2.1.  Metric TLV procedures

   Two Metric TLVs with Metric Type between 0x00 and 0x0f can be
   compared to determine the lower/higher metric. The comparison
   procedure is as follows:

      1. A metric with Metric Type 'n' is always lower than a metric of
         Metric Type 'n+1'. This is independent of the Metric Value.
      2. If two metrics have the same Metric Type (except if it is 0x0f)
         then the comparison is made on the value obtained by adding the
         metric (from the route table) for the route to the Egress
         Address Prefix FEC Element (from the corresponding H-Label TLV)
         to the Metric Value.
      3. If two metrics have a Metric Type of 0x0f then the comparison
         is made using only the Metric Value. If the values are the same
         after comparison, the two metrics are considered equal-cost.

4.1.3.  More Label TLV

   This TLV is optional in the Label Mapping message that has a Label
   Request Message ID TLV.

4.1.3.1.  More Label TLV procedures

   This TLV being present indicates that more label mappings will be
   sent for that FEC in response to a specific Label Request Message.

4.1.4.  H-Label Capability Parameter TLV

   This TLV is defined to enable the Hierarchical Label capability. It
   follows the encoding specified in [LDP-CAP]. There is no Capability
   Data associated with this TLV. The motivation and behavior when this
   capability is enabled are all described in this document.

4.2.  Extensions to Label distribution and management

4.2.1.  Label mapping origination by Egress LSR

   An Hierarchical Label capable LSR that is an egress for a FEC due to
   the nexthop being outside of the label switching network or the FEC
   elements being reachable by crossing a routing domain boundary SHOULD
   originate a label mapping with a H-Label. The H-Label MUST have LSR
   Egress Address as the LSR's own address (typically its loopback
   address). These mappings SHOULD be advertised to all neighbors that
   are Hierarchical Label capable. If a neighbor does not have
   Hierarchical Label capability the LSR MUST advertise labels to it as
   specified by [LDP].

4.2.2.  Label Distribution Control Mode

   Both independent and ordered LSP controls are supported when H-Label
   mappings are advertised.

4.2.2.1.  Independent Label Distribution Control

   An LSR that is not an egress for a FEC SHOULD advertise H-Label
   mappings for a FEC with its address (typically loopback) as the
   Egress LSR Address, if it does not receive H-Label mappings from one
   of the FEC's nexthops. The LSR MUST additionally advertise a label
   mapping as described in [LDP] if it has a neighbor that does not have
   Hierarchical Label Capability.

Internet Draft                LDP H-Labels              January 26, 2011


4.2.2.2.  Ordered Label Distribution Control

   In this control mode an LSR that receives H-Label mappings from its
   neighbors, selects those with the lowest cost paths to the FEC. The
   selection algorithm is described in detail in section 4.3.1.1. These
   mappings are advertised to its neighbors that are Hierarchical Label
   capable. Note that routes corresponding to the FECs need not appear
   in the route table (via IGP) before advertising these label mappings
   to neighboring LSRs. However, a LSP to the Egress LSR Address must be
   present. If a neighbor is not Hierarchical Label capable then a label
   as described in [LDP] is advertised. The FTN and ILM entry creation
   is described in section 4.2.4. 

4.2.3.  Label Retention Mode

4.2.3.1.  Conservative Label Retention Mode

   When using Conservative Label Retention mode, if all the
   paths/nexthops for the FEC have a common Shared Risk Link Group
   (SRLG) it is RECOMMENDED that the LSR have as a backup an alternative
   nexthop that doesn't share an SRLG. This could involve requesting a
   label from another neighbor. The method to determine the alternate
   nexthop is outside the scope of this document.

4.2.4.  Label Installation

   When an H-Label is installed for a FEC in the FTN, packets belonging
   to the FEC are switched using a hierarchical LSP. The LSP with outer
   label goes to the egress LSR of the FEC. If some LSRs along the
   routed path do not support H-Labels, the outer LSP goes till the
   furthest downstream LSR (that supports H-Labels) along the routed
   path to the egress LSR before an LSR incapable of H-Label occurs. The
   outer LSP may even be a TE LSP.  The inner LSP identifies the FEC at
   the egress of the outer LSP.

   If a FEC for which a H-Label mapping exists was advertised to a
   neighbor without the H-Label (due to that neighbor not being capable)
   then the Incoming Label Map (ILM) entry should be installed with a
   swap operation to the hierarchical LSP.

   If an LSR is purely a transit LSR it SHOULD NOT install any entries
   in the data plane for label mapping messages with an H-Label.

4.3.  Extensions to LDP Messages

   This section defines extensions to the LDP Messages and procedures
   defined in [LDP] and [LDP-IA].

4.3.1.  Label Mapping Message

   The encoding of the Label Mapping Message has the following
   modifications:

      1. An H-Label TLV can be present instead of a Label TLV. See TLV
         encoding in section 4.1.1. 
      2. An optional parameter Metric TLV can occur if an H-Label is
         present. See TLV encoding in section 4.1.2. 

4.3.1.1.  Label Mapping Message procedures

   Hierarchical Label capable LSRs originate Label Mapping as described
   in sections 4.2.1. and 4.2.2.1. The Egress LSR Address in the H-Label
   MUST be an address that belongs to that LSR and has a path from other
   LSRs. Typically this would be a loopback address for which a LDP
   label mapping has been advertised. If the metric for the FEC is non-
   zero then a Metric TLV with appropriate Metric Type and Metric Value
   is included. An H-Label SHOULD NOT be advertised for addresses that
   belong to the LSR e.g. loopback addresses.

   When an LSR receives Label Mapping Messages for a FEC containing an
   H-Label, it selects some of these label mappings for advertising to
   neighbors and installation into the FTN and ILM. The selection
   algorithm is as follows. Firstly, mappings received from neighbors
   that are the nexthop for the Egress LSR Address in the corresponding
   H-Label are chosen. These mappings are advertised to all LDP
   neighbors. From among these, the mappings with the lowest metric
   value are chosen using the metric comparison algorithm from section
   4.1.2.1.  These label mappings are installed in FTN and ILM entries
   as described in section 4.2. 

4.3.2.  Label Request Message

   The FEC TLV in the request message can contain a Wildcard FEC
   Element.

4.3.2.1.  Label Request Message Procedure

   On receiving a Label Request Message, the LSR creates Label Mapping
   messages for all the Labels for that FEC. If the FEC TLV has a
   Wildcard FEC Element then all for which label mappings are present
   are returned in the response. In this case multiple label mapping
   messages are sent in response. On receiving the LSR additionally
   checks if it has selected mappings for that FEC according to the
   procedure in section 4.3.1.1. Those mappings are sent as a response

4.4.  Structuring the FTN

   When installing a FTN entry corresponding to a Label Mapping message
   with a H-Label, a hierarchy must be used. First a push operation
   using the Label from the Generic Label TLV in the H-Label must be
   done. This is the LSP for the FEC that is higher in the LSP
   hierarchy. This must be followed by a push operation of a label for a
   LSP to the Egress LSR Address. This LSP is lower in the hierarchy.
   Implementations should handle changes to the nexthops of the LSP to
   the Egress LSR Address in such a way that the LSPs higher in the
   hierarchy are quickly updated to realize fast convergence.

5.  Mapping metrics of specific IGPs

   The 32-bit value in the Metric TLV is sufficient to contain metrics
   defined for IGPs in [OSPF], [ISIS-TE] and [RIPv2]. The preferences
   between different routes of an IGP are described within the IGP e.g.,
   [OSPF], [ISIS-2LVL] etc. The Metric Type for the Metric TLV (defined
   in 4.1.2. ) should be chosen in accordance with the IGPs definitions.
   It should be noted that a metric such as the OSPF Type-2 external
   metric MUST be mapped to a Metric Type 0xf in the H-Label mapping.

   This section describes TLVs that are defined in this document and
   their associated procedures.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not bring any new security considerations beyond
   those already described in [LDP].

7.  IANA Considerations

   The following assignments are required from IANA - TLV Types for
   Hierarchical Label Capability Parameter, H-Label, Metric and More
   Label. Recommend next available values 0x604, 0x605, 0x606 and 0x607.

       Implementation Techniques of the Lightweight TCP/IP Stack
                   draft-chen-lwip-implementataion-01

Abstract

   Since small devices such as sensors are often required to be
   physically small and inexpensive, an implementation of the Internet
   protocols will have to deal with having limited computing resources
   and memory.  This report describes the design and implementation of a
   small TCP/IP stack called lwIP that is small enough to be used in
   minimal systems.

1.  Non-layered protocols

   With the era of the Internet of Things, the applications of smart
   objects are more and more widely used.  Smart objects are usually
   low- power and have limited memory communication capabilities.  In
   the past, they usually communicated through a protocol-translation
   gateway, which is typically of non-IP architecture.  However,
   protocol gateways are inherently complex to design, manage, and
   deploy.  It requests for scalability, interoperability and solid
   standardization based networking technology to support a large number
   of applications of smart objects.  It is well known that IP is a
   stable, long-lived and highly scalable communication technology.  So
   it can support a wide range of applications, devices, and underlying
   communication technologies.

   As smart objects will connect a larger number of devices than any
   other existing Internet, scalability is critical.  The next
   generation Internet protocol, IPv6, expands the address space of IP
   to 2^128, which has been said to be enough to provide every grain of
   sand on the planet with an IP address.  In addition, the advantage of
   Plug and Play, security, QoS, mobility of IPv6 make it better to meet
   the needs of smart objects connecting.

   However, IPv6 cannot be directly applied in the smart device.  It
   requests for correspondingly simplifying the IPv6 protocol stacks and
   routing mechanisms to meet the requirements of network with low power
   consumption, low storage capacity and low transfer rate.  This
   document introduces the design and implementation of the Lightweight
   TCP/IP Stack, and the problems met by implementers.

2.  Existing Protocols

2.1.  Network Layer

   For constrained devices, 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power WPAN) Working
   Group in IETF specifies some feasible implementation at network
   layer. 6LoWPAN intends to establish a low power Wireless Personal
   Area Network standard, and uses IPv6 as the low layer protocol in
   IEEE 802.15.4.  Until now, 6LoWPAN WG has worked out some overviews
   and protocol drafts in RFC4944 and RFC4919, and brought up some
   important drafts about head compression and decompression, neighbor
   discovery, security and mobility management.

   ROLL Working Group specifies routing over Low-Power and Lossy
   Networks(LLN), which is also based on IPv6.  The goal of this WG is
   to make the third layer routing to traverse any number of base link
   layer protocols and physical medium.  Compared with 6LoWPAN of making
   the frame size to fit with IPv6, ROLL is to adapt or create a
   protocol, which can solve the package loss problem of low power
   devices that often cause by interference and mobility.  Until now,
   there are some drafts and RFC approved.

2.2.  Transport Layer

   In common cases, TCP and UDP are used in transport layer.  However,
   for constrained devices, TCP and UDP are too heavy to implement all
   the functions.

   Some working groups are involved in this kind of work, but there is
   seemingly no specific approach to deal with simplifying TCP and UDP.

2.3.  Application Layer

   CoRE Working Group specifies CoAP protocol to deal with constrained
   resource network.  CoAP is a specialized RESTful transfer protocol
   for use with constrained networks and nodes for machine-to-machine
   applications such as smart energy and building automation.  It can
   easily translate to HTTP for integration with the web while meeting
   specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead
   and simplicity for constrained environments.

3.  Non-layered protocols

   In most common cases, TCP/IP protocols are implemented by modularity
   and layering.  But for the constraint systems, layering will increase
   the cost so as to affect the overall performance.  Moreover, there is
   no strict barrier between the kernel and application processes, such
   as TinyOS and Contiki.

   So there is no strict layer in Lightweight TCP/IP protocols, which
   are designed to be tight-coupled in order to shorten the codes and
   save the memory.  Non-layered protocols can be implemented by queue
   method to cache the packages.

   As long as there is no layer concept, when sending packages,
   application calls directly to the end.  When receiving, protocol
   stack uses callback functions to get the packages.  And all the
   applications need to register the callback functions in advance.
   Furthermore, the retransmission should be done by applications.

   What's more, the TCP should care about the connection states, e.g.
   three-way handshaking.

4.  Memory Management

   Many TCP/IP protocols use dynamic memory allocation schemes.
   However, constraint devices with several kilo of memory can survive
   this kind of schemes.

   Lightweight TCP/IP Protocols use static memory allocation schemes to
   pre-allocation memory for each usage.  Memory allocation is done when
   compiling, which is base on the pre-decision of the package size in
   the network.  More attention should be paying to the cache to ensure
   it can hold the greatest size package.

5.  Application Programming Interfaces

   Multitasking system imposes a significant overhead for the need for
   task management, context switching and allocation of stack space.

   As a result, the constrained systems don't support multitask.
   Lightweight TCP/IP Protocols are designed to be simple, single-task,
   and have a reduced event driven API with only the needed functions.
   For example, there're no socket options which are needed in the
   integrity socket in order to save memory, as we merely develop quite
   simple applications in constrained systems.  Furthermore, there's no
   need for receive function, for the protocol stack use callback
   functions to receive packages, as mentioned before.

6.  TCP Communication

   Many TCP/IP implementations, realize the sliding window algorithm,
   which allows the sender to deliver multiple segments continuously,
   without having to stop and wait for an acknowledgment for each
   segment.  The congestion control algorithm is realized as well, in
   order to limit the number of simultaneous TCP segments in the
   network.  Furthermore, overtime retransmission mechanism is
   sufficiently implemented by the stack.

   Lightweight TCP implementations, only handle a TCP connection at a
   time, while a TCP connection only allows a TCP segment to be
   unacknowledged.  Due to a TCP connection dealt at a time, there is no
   need for the sliding window algorithm.  Due to no more than one TCP
   segment per connection, the number of simultaneous TCP segments in
   the network is rather limited, and there is no need for he congestion
   control algorithm either.  As for the overtime retransmission
   mechanism, it is up to the stack to decide when to retransmit, but
   the application to execute the retransmission actually.  Moreover,
   checksum algorithm shall be implemented according to the
   architecture.

7.  Protocol Implementations

   Lightweight TCP/IP implementations, in resource-constrained devices,
   shall be fully compliant with the standard TCP/IP and other
   simplified and limited TCP/IP implementations.  They should be able
   to support IP, NDP and TTL time-out estimation.  For ICMPv6, only
   some common types should be enforced,such as echo request and echo
   request.  IP options and fragment reassembly can be ignored, as
   fragment reassembly can be avoided by MTU configuration.

Abstract 

   This document defines an enhancement to Bi-directional Forwarding 
   Detection (BFD) for MPLS LSPs [MPLS-BFD] that can be used to specify 
   the return path of BFD control packets for a specific BFD session. 
   Specifying return co-routed or protected return path increases 
   robustness of BFD failure detection and reduces false positives. 
   This document also defines a way to avoid duplicate BFD sessions 
   currently encountered with Co-routed Bidirectional LSPs and 
   Associated Bidirectional LSP. The enhancement halves the BFD 
   sessions over those LSPs, and allows a Co-routed Bidirectional LSPs 
   or Associated Bidirectional LSPs to be protected and switched as a 
   single entity.

Internet-Draft        BFD for MPLS Enhancement            October 2009 
    

   the return path of BFD control packets for a specific BFD session. 
   In traffic engineered networks, LSPs usually do not follow IP 
   routing or there are multiple LSPs between same nodes. Specifying 
   return path to be congruent with forward path ensures that failures 
   in other paths (e.g. shortest path for IP routing) do not cause BFD 
   failure detection for the forward path. This extension hence 
   increases robustness of BFD based failure detection, especially in 
   LSP 1:1 type protection cases. Also specifying FRR protected LSP as 
   return path can increase robustness. 

   This document also defines a way to avoid duplicate BFD sessions 
   when BFD is used for Bidirectional LSP or for a pair of 
   unidirectional LSPs. This extension allows a Bidirectional LSP or a 
   pair of unidirectional LSPs to be protected and switched as a whole 
   entity.  

   In this document, term Bidirectional LSP includes Co-routed 
   Bidirectional LSP defined in [RFC 3471] [RFC 3473] and Associated 
   Bidirectional LSP (that is constructed from a pair of unidirectional 
   LSPs).  

2. Problem statements 

   BFD for MPLS LSPs (BFDoMPLS) is defined in [BFD-MPLS] and used for 
   detecting end-to-end reachability of LSP. BFD for MPLS is an 
   important feature for the packetized MPLS/optical converged network, 
   as it provides end-to-end connectivity verification. Reverse 
   direction of MPLS for BFD follows routing, and hence it can not be 
   used for protection decisions, if more than one alternate path is 
   available.  

   LSP Ping [RFC 4379] is used to bootstrap the BFD sessions. With the 
   current mechanisms defined in [BFD-MPLS]:  

     1. For each direction of a LSP, a separate BFD session is required 
        to be established. That means for unidirectional LSP, only one 
        session is needed, but for a Bidirectional LSP, there will be 
        two BFD sessions. This will result in not only doubling the BFD 
        sessions over the LSP, but sometimes failing to perform 
        protection and switching when the Bidirectional LSP is desired 
        to be operated as a single entity. This is due to the two BFD 
        sessions that are individually responsible for each direction 
        of the Bidirectional LSP having no inherent relationship.  It 
        is possible that one session detects failure and the other does 
        not, with the result that one direction switches while the 
        other does not. This can cause unexpected operational problems.

     2. For a specific BFD session, the return path (which carries the 
        BFD control packets), which could be an IP path or a LSP is 
        selected by the egress.  The choice is a local decision of the 
        egress, and egress does not have enough information to perform 
        a choice that would produce both directions of BFD transiting 
        same path. In some cases, it is very valuable to specify the 
        return path for a BFD session. For example, selecting a more 
        reliable return path (e.g., TE LSP with FRR protection) could 
        improve the reliability of reply BFD control packets or 
        selecting co-routed LSP would allow use of BFDoMPLS as trigger 
        for LSP protection. 

3. Enhancement to BFD for MPLS 

   The enhancement described in this document improves upon "BFD for 
   MPLS LSPs" [BFD-MPLS], in the following areas: 

     1. Allows LSP ingress node to signal the desired return path for 
        any BFDoMPLS session. 

     2. Allows operator to provision BFD on both forwarding and return 
        path of Bidirectional LSPs with a single BFD session. This 
        extension halves the number BFD sessions over the LSP, and 
        enables that a Bidirectional LSP could be protected and 
        switched as a single entity. 

     3. Allows operator to provision BFD on two unidirectional LSPs 
        (one for each direction) with a single BFD session. This 
        reduces number of BFD sessions, and hence reduces control plane 
        load. However in some cases (e.g. where make-before-break is 
        used), this is undesirable, and hence this feature is optional. 

   All the goals listed above are only relevant to BFD session 
   establishment, so the enhancement defined in this document is mainly 
   focus on BFD session establishment. The "return path specified" 
   mechanisms defined in [LSP-PING-RP] are used in this document. 

4. Session Establishment 

   As defined in [BFD-MPLS], a BFD session is boot-strapped by LSP Ping.  
   All the procedures for session establishment defined in [BFD-MPLS] 
   apply here. In addition to that, a RP TLV MUST be carried in the 
   echo request. This is used to notify the egress LSR to select the 
   return path of the BFD session. The return path is identified by the 
   FEC sub-TLV encoded in the RP TLV.

Internet-Draft        BFD for MPLS Enhancement            October 2009 
    

   Except for "Any Candidate sub-TLV" that is defined in [LSP-PING-RP], 
   any other sub-TLVs are applicable to be included in RP TLV to 
   explicitly specify the return path of a BFD session.  

   If RP TLV is present in LSP ping message that setups BFD for MPLS 
   sessions: 

     o LSP ping reply packet MUST be sent as specified in preceding 
        [LSP-PING-RP]. 

     o BFD for MPLS packets MUST be sent via same reply channel used 
        for LSP ping reply packets. 

     o If selected path becomes unavailable (and no other path meeting 
        specifications in previously received RP TLV is present), 
        transmission of BFD packets MUST be interrupted. Transmission 
        of BFD packets MUST resume, if return path LSP becomes 
        available. 

   It is permissible for multiple BFD for MPLS sessions to use same 
   return path -- when node does make-before-break (MBB), it can signal 
   separate BFD for MPLS session to test new LSP before taking it into 
   use. 

   In this document, a new TLV, Session Control TLV is defined. Session 
   Control TLV is used to notify the egress LSR whether to establish 
   another BFD session for the backward direction of a Bidirectional 
   LSP or a pair of unidirectional LSPs (one for each direction). If 
   Session Control TLV is carried, the egress LSR MUST not initiate 
   another separate BFD session for the backward direction of the 
   Bidirectional LSP or the pair of unidirectional LSPs. If BFD session 
   has been provisioned to both nodes, the node with a numerically 
   larger IP address (comparison using signaled LSP endpoint addresses) 
   shall initiate signaling. If node with the larger IP receives LSP 
   ping message signaling BFD session with Session Control TLV, LSP 
   ping reply must be transmitted with "Backward direction BFD session 
   exists" to the ingress LSR. If there is no Session Control TLV 
   carried in the echo request, it's up to the egress LSR to decide 
   whether to initiate another BFD session for the backward direction 
   LSP, this is the same as the definition in [BFD-MPLS].  

4.1. Session Control TLV 

   Session Control TLV is an optional TLV, it is carried in echo 
   request to notify the egress LSR not to initiate another BFD session 
   for the backward direction of a Bidirectional LSP or pair of

   unidirectional LSPs (one for each direction). The format of Session 
   Control TLV is as follows: 

   0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |     Session Control Type      |          Length               |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
            
   The Session Control TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and the 
   type value is TBD. 

   Length field is 2 octets in length, the value of length field SHOULD 
   be 0, unless any sub-TLVs (defined in future) are present. 

4.2. The usage of IPv4/IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLVs 

   IPv4/IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLVs are defined in [LSP-PING-RP], which 
   are used to notify the egress LSR of a specific LSP how to choose 
   the return path for an echo reply. 

   In this document, these sub-TLVs are re-used to notify the egress 
   LSR of a specific LSP how to choose the return path of a BFD session. 

   As stated in section 2 of this document, it is possible to have 
   multiple parallel LSPs between the ingress and egress LSRs.  In a 
   typical network example, a group of parallel LSPs have the same 
   tunnel ID but different LSP IDs. There is one primary and one or 
   more secondary LSPs in each direction. When establishing a BFD 
   session for an LSP, it is common for the primary LSP to choose the 
   primary as the return path and the secondary LSP to choose the 
   secondary as the return path. With the IPv4/IPv6 Tunnel sub-TLVs, 
   operators don't have to specify a specific return LSP. They just 
   need to specify from which tunnel the return LSP should be chosen, 
   and specify the type (e.g., primary or secondary) of the return LSP. 
   The egress LSR will then choose the proper return path.  

   Use of IPv4/IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLVs permits MBB on return path of 
   BFD session. If a specific RSVP session would be selected (with FEC 
   containing LSP ID), return path would be interrupted if egress node 
   would do MBB for the return path. This is due to the fact that MBB 
   is based on signaling new LSP with different LSP ID and then 
   deleting old LSP - after MBB selected return path would no longer be 
   available. MBB is common occurrence as it is often used for changing 
   LSP attributes, such as reserved bandwidth. With the extensions in

   [LSP-PING-RP], desired LSP can be selected without limiting use of 
   MBB. 
    

5. Security Considerations 

   Security considerations discussed in [BFD-MPLS], [BFD], [BFD-MHOP] 
   and [RFC4379] apply to this document. 

   Limitations on permitted return path LSPs specified [LSP-PING-RP] 
   apply to extensions specified in this document.  

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from registries 
   under its control. 

     6.1. Return code 

   IANA is requested to assign a new return code as follows: 

       Type #                  Value Field 
       ------                  ----------- 
           11                  Backward direction session exists 
    

     6.2. Session Control TLV 

   IANA is requested to assign a new TLV type (TBD) from the range of 
   0-16383. We suggest that the value 21 be assigned for the new RP TLV 
   type. 

       Type    Value Field 
      -----    ----------- 
         21    Session Control

Abstract

   This document provides an overview of the security mechanisms that
   are probably fit for ALTO. Specifically it discusses those mechanisms
   for authentication, encryption and attack-preventing. The goal
   of this draft is to list and analyze the existing security 
   mechanisms, and to explore suitable solutions to guarantee the 
   security of ALTO protocol. This draft is a very early draft to 
   outline the possible security mechanisms and leaves considerable 
   contents and details to be added later.

Internet-Draft           ALTO security overview              March, 2010


1.  Introduction

   Helping peer-to-peer (P2P) application to select better peers from a
   set of candidates is currently one of most popular research areas. 
   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) 
   [I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement] is to provide guidance to p2p 
   applications, which is based on parameters that affect performance 
   and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the 
   topological distance. However, ALTO may be insecure when the clients 
   are trustless or unauthorized. In this case, clients can steal ISP's 
   ALTO information by snoop or deceit that would do harm to ALTO 
   structure. 

   This draft gives the security issues between ALTO server and client 
   which MAY be unauthorized. Part of these issues had been discussed in
   the mailing list, but this draft will give a summary of ALTO 
   security issues with all kinds of situations. Since ISP privacy and 
   P2P privacy issues had been discussed a lot in 
   [I-D.wang-alto-privacy-load-analysis], this draft will focus mainly 
   on security issues among unauthorized parties. Additionally the common 
   authentication/encryption and attack- preventing mechanisms which are
   suitable for ALTO protocol are given below.

2.  Terminology and Concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document also reuses the concepts defined in
   [I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement] and [I-D.ietf-alto-reqs].

3.  ALTO security requirements

   ALTO protocol has some minimum-to-implement security requirements. 
   This set of security requirements has been listed in Section 3.3 in
   [I-D.ietf-alto-reqs]. 
   
   General ALTO security requirements include four parts:
   (1) Preventing an ISP's internal topology from being leaked
   (2) Preventing an ISP from learning about P2P application behavior 
   (e.g., the information about peers with which it is connecting)
   (3) Preventing unauthorized access to ISP's ALTO information. There 
   are a couple of cases here:
     (a) An ALTO Server sends the information directly to an 
     unauthorized ALTO Client
     (b) An unauthorized party snoops on the data transmission from the 
     ALTO Server to an authorized ALTO Client.
     (c) An authorized ALTO Client knowingly sends the information to an
     unauthorized party
   (4) Preventing an ALTO Server from being attacked by malicious 
   behavior due to the insecure design of ALTO protocol (e.g., DoS)

   Here is the figure describing this situation:

Internet-Draft           ALTO security overview              March, 2010

   According to classification of ALTO security issues, (1)(2) have 
   nothing to do with authentication/encryption because they only 
   concern about the ALTO servers and authorized ALTO clients. 
   Transmission over them only refers to the content but not the roles.
   While in part 3, (3a) and (3b) are closely related to 
   authentication/encryption, but (3c) is not. There are not many 
   methods for authorized ALTO client to prevent ISP's ALTO information
   from being leaked to unauthorized parties. Since when ALTO client 
   requests the desired information, ALTO server will surely send out 
   desired information to the requester no matter whether it is 
   authorized or not. (4) is an independent security part, which refers
   to mechanisms for ALTO Server against attacks like DoS. There are 
   solutions mentioned in other draft for (1)(2) in most cases, and some
   solutions for (3)(4) will be given below.

4.  ALTO security mechanisms

   Client in ALTO may be unauthorized that means it can cheat the server
   to threaten the ALTO security. Based on the four parts above, ALTO 
   security mechanisms at least contain authentication, encryption and 
   attack-preventing. 

4.1.  Authentication mechanism

4.1.1. No Authentication

   The simplest case is that all clients in ALTO are trustworthy or a 
   kind of filtering is done before clients join the network. In this
   case, authentication is needless.

Internet-Draft           ALTO security overview              March, 2010

4.1.2. HTTP Digest Access Authentication

   HTTP Digest Access Authentication is one of the agreed methods that a
   web server can use to negotiate credentials with a web user (using 
   the HTTP protocol). Digest authentication is intended to supersede 
   unencrypted use of the Basic access authentication, allowing user 
   identity to be established securely without having to send a password
   in plaintext over the network. 

   HTTP provides a simple challenge-response authentication mechanism 
   that MAY be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a 
   client to provide authentication information. That is quite suitable
   for ALTO framework since ALTO is also the server/client framework. 
   When the ALTO server receives the requested message, it will 
   challenge the client who initiates the request and the client in the
   same time will give the response providing its authentication 
   information. 

   The Digest scheme challenges using a nonce value. A valid response 
   contains a checksum (by default, the MD5 checksum) of the username, 
   the password, the given nonce value, the HTTP method, and the 
   requested URI.

   HTTP Digest Access Authentication is simple and secure in web-level 
   applications providing a more complex authentication than Basic 
   authentication, and it introduces the server/client nonce which will
   prevent replay and chosen plaintext attacks. However it has many 
   known limitations. Digest access authentication is intended as a 
   security trade-off, therefore it is no secure than public key or 
   Kerberos authentication. But Digest access authentication will make 
   ALTO protocol lightweight so that security will not bring ALTO 
   protocol too much overhead.

4.2.  Encryption mechanism

4.2.1. SSLv3/TLS

   SSL(Secure Socket Layer)and TLS(Transport Layer Security)are widely 
   used cryptographic protocols that provide security for several 
   applications in the Internet like web browsing, VoIP, e-mail. SSLv3 
   is the third version of SSL and developed by Netscape Corporation. 
   TLS is an IETF standards track protocol, last updated in RFC 5246. 

   The TLS protocol allows client/server applications to communicate 
   across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping and 
   tampering. TLS provides endpoint authentication and communications 
   confidentiality over the Internet using cryptography. Typically, the
   key information and certificates necessary for TLS are handled in the
   form of X.509 certificates, which define required fields and data 
   formats.

   SSL operates in modular fashion. It is extensible, with support for 
   forward and backward compatibility and negotiation between peers.

   SSL/TLS can provide:
   (1) Authentication between server and client. That will ensure that 
   the information is sent to the correct client or server. 
   (2) Data encryption. Before the secure connection is established, 
   both parties use the asymmetric key cryptography. After the 
   establishment, symmetric key cryptography will be used. That will 
   keep ISP's information not leaked to unauthorized parties.
   (3) Ensure data integrity. Using hash function makes data integrity.

   SSL/TLS is a standard method to protect SIP application signaling. 
   SSL/TLS can be used to provide authentication and encryption of the 
   SIP signaling associated with VoIP and other SIP-based applications. 
   Be similar to SIP, SSL/TLS can also be used to provide authentication
   and encryption of ISP's ALTO information that is communicated between
   server and client. 

4.3.  Attack-preventing mechanism

   Since ALTO server may be the target of attack, ALTO should provide 
   security mechanism to protect ALTO server from being attacked by 
   malicious behavior (e.g., DoS). Due to the insecure design of ALTO 
   protocol, there are several risks for attacker to harm ALTO. When 
   ALTO client/server communicates, they establish a TCP connection. In
   response to query messages, an ALTO client/server constructs and 
   sends messages containing TCP messages. And it makes DoS attacks 
   possible if the attackers produce thousands of TCP request with
   fake IP addresses that their ACKs will never be received by the 
   server. This makes the server wastes much time and CPU to wait for 
   non-existent ACK. It harms great to ALTO system.

   An useful mechanism for DoS attack includes SYN cookie and 
   restraining the connection number in definite time and from definite
   source. Another widely used method is firewall.

       Implementation Techniques of the Lightweight TCP/IP Stack
                   draft-chen-lwip-implementataion-00

Abstract

   Since small devices such as sensors are often required to be
   physically small and inexpensive, an implementation of the Internet
   protocols will have to deal with having limited computing resources
   and memory.  This report describes the design and implementation of a
   small TCP/IP stack called lwIP that is small enough to be used in
   minimal systems.

1.  Non-layered protocols

   In most common cases, TCP/IP protocols are implemented by modularity
   and layering.  But for the constraint systems, layering will increase
   the cost so as to affect the overall performance.  Moreover, there is
   no strict barrier between the kernel and application processes, such
   as TinyOS and Contiki.

   So there is no strict layer in Lightweight TCP/IP protocols, which
   are designed to be tight-coupled in order to shorten the codes and
   save the memory.  Non-layered protocols can be implemented by queue
   method to cache the packages.

   As long as there is no layer concept, when sending packages,
   application calls directly to the end.  When receiving, protocol
   stack uses callback functions to get the packages.  And all the
   applications need to register the callback functions in advance.
   Furthermore, the retransmission should be done by applications.

   What's more, the TCP should care about the connection states, e.g.
   three-way handshaking.

2.  Memory Management

   Many TCP/IP protocols use dynamic memory allocation schemes.
   Unfortunately, constraint devices with several kilo of memory can't
   survive this kind of schemes.

   Lightweight TCP/IP Protocols use static memory allocation schemes to
   pre-allocation memory for each usage.  Memory allocation is done when
   compiling, which is based on the pre-decision of the package size in
   the network.  More attention should be payed to the cache to ensure
   that it can hold the greatest size package.

3.  Application Programming Interfaces

   Multitasking system imposes a significant overhead for the need for
   task management, context switching and allocation of stack space.

   As a result, the constrained systems don't support multitask.
   Lightweight TCP/IP Protocols are designed to be simple, single-task,
   and have a reduced event driven API with only the needed functions.
   For example, there're no socket options which are needed in the
   integrity socket.  Furthermore, there's no need for Receive function,
   for the protocol stack use callback functions to receive packages, as
   mentioned before.

4.  TCP Implementation

   Many TCP/IP implementations, realize the sliding window algorithm,
   which allows the sender to deliver multiple segments continuously,
   without having to stop and wait for an acknowledgment for each
   segment.  The congestion control algorithm is realized as well, in
   order to limit the number of simultaneous TCP segments in the
   network.  Furthermore, overtime retransmission mechanism is
   sufficiently implemented by the stack.

   Lightweight TCP implementations, only handle a TCP connection at a
   time, while a TCP connection only allows a TCP segment to be
   unacknowledged.  Due to a TCP connection dealt at a time, there is no
   need for the sliding window algorithm.  Due to no more than one TCP
   segment per connection, the number of simultaneous TCP segments in
   the network is rather limited, and there is no need for the
   congestion control algorithm either.  As for the overtime
   retransmission mechanism, it is up to the stack to decide when to
   retransmit, but the application to execute the retransmission
   actually.  Moreover, checksum algorithm shall be implemented
   according to the architecture.

5.  Protocol Implementations

   Lightweight TCP/IP implementations, in resource-constrained devices,
   shall be fully compliant with the standard TCP/IP and other
   simplified and limited TCP/IP implementations.  They should be able
   to support ARP, IP, ICMP and TTL time-out estimation.  ICMP can
   merely implement echo request and echo reply.  IP options and
   fragment reassembly can be ignored, as fragment reassembly can be
   avoided by MTU configuration.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes an X.509v3 certificate extension that states 
   the safety status of the certificate subject. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
   This certificate extension binds security information to the subject.
   Through this extend certificate, the subject's safety status can be 
   obtained by the authentication entity when identity authenticating, 
   thus to be aware of security attributes of the subject. If one entity
   with extend certificate with security information wants to join a 
   certain network, network manager can evaluate entity's safety status 
   according to its assessment standards, then make certain strategies, 
   such as partition security level or security domain, to guarantee 
   network safety; if the entity wants to communicate with another, it 
   can also implements security strategy to ensure a safe between 
   transactions, such as resource access control.  
   
   The issuer of the certificate is a trusted entity (or a trusted third
   party) that can identify and verify one subject's security 
   information.Generically, security information is obtained through 
   remote scanning measures. If can't, it is gained through local 
   scanning by entity itself. Security threats and security protection 
   software installed in the entity reflect the safety status of the 
   subject directly and indirectly.     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
   When a X.509 certificate contains an extension with security 
   information, the extension MUST be critical, and MUST contain either 
   a NULL to indicate that no security information is provided or 
   explicit security information to indicate that the security 
   information is provided.

2.  X.509 Extension with security information

   Conventional security mechanisms, such as security domain and
   boundary protection system, didn't take underlay safety status of
   the entity into consideration, which limit their range of 
   applicability. Especially for distributed network, security 
   protection of the nodes on underlay will influence the security 
   degree of distributed network. Thus nodes with weak protection in 
   underlay will greatly deteriorate security of the distributed 
   network.

   This certificate extension keeps underlay security information of the
   subject, and provides a basis for security strategy formulation. 
   Based on X.509 extension certificate with security information, one 
   entity or node can cognize another's security posture, then adjusts 
   strategy to avoid attacks from malicious entities.
   
   The issuer of the certificate is a trusted entity (or a trusted third
   party) that can identify and verify one subject's security 
   information. Usually, security information is obtained by a trusted 
   third party through remote scanning. Specially, if it is unable to 
   get information through this method, it can be obtained through local 
   scanning by the entity itself.
                                   
   In general, security information is reflected in two ways. On one 
   hand, security protection software such as Antivirus, Firewall and
   Operating System (OS) installed in the user reflect safety condition 
   of the subject directly or indirectly. On the other hand, security 
   threats such as malicious plug-ins exists in the user can also 
   represent security status of one subject. The more threats exist, 
   the more unsafe the entity is. Other retrievable information that can
   make sense for security properties of subjects can also be added 
   according to certain needs.
   
   Parameters of security protection software SHOULD be as specific as 
   possible. But for private information, such as operating system 
   software parameters, it SHOULD be abstracted as a security score, 
   ranges in [0, 99].
   
   The traditional X.509 certificate (without security information) has 
   a validity period indicating the time interval during which the CA 
   warrants that it will maintain information about the status of the 
   certificate. Normally, it updates when the validity period is due or 
   the key pair is no longer safe. But for certificate with extend 
   security information, security information changes frequently. In 
   order to ensure the accuracy of the security information in the 
   certificate, security information MUST contain a validity period,
   while month or week is the unit. When this validity period is due, 
   the certificate SHOULD be renewed. For security information updates 
   per month/week, it increases the whole certificate update frequency.
   Higher update frequency increases costs.
                                   
   Therefore, when certificate update is caused by security information,
   certificate update process SHOULD be simplified. Only update the 
   security information of one subject without changing any other 
   personal information that should be authenticated in certificate 
   generation. Thus, certificate update only need to reload security 
   information, thus there is no need of original complicated

   examination process about subject personal information which is 
   related to its identity. 
   
   An example of one use of the extend X.509 certificate with security 
   information is a user using it to control the access of other users.
   Suppose both user A and B contain X.509 certificate with security 
   information. If user A has some certain resources, and only permits
   access for those whose Operating System score is equal to or greater
   than 85. User B wants to access this resource. User A can obtain 
   security information of user B through B's X.509 extension 
   certificate, and determine whether it is qualified. If proved, user B
   can get access to the resources, else user A SHOULD refuse its access
   request. 
                                                  
   X.509 extension with security information formats are as follows.   
                                                              
2.1  OID

   The OID for this extension is id-pe-securityInfo.     
   
     id-pe-securityInfo  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 25 }
     
   where [RFC5280] defines:                                                    
  
     id-pkix  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3)          
              dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }                      
                                                                               
     id-pe  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 1 } 
   
2.2  Criticality  

   This extension SHOULD be CRITICAL. The intended use of this extension
   is to indicate safety status of the identified subject. The issuer 
   uses extended certificate to convey the notion that a relying party 
   MUST understand the semantics of the extension to make use of the 
   certificate for the purpose it was issued. Newly created applications
   that use certificates containing this extension are expected to 
   recognize the extension. 

2.3  X.509 Security Information extension Syntax
   
   The syntax for the X.509 extension is:  
                                      
   SecurityInfo   ::= CHOICE {                                                
     none                   NULL,            --No security info provided      
     secInfo                SecurityInformation --Explicit security info
   }

2.4  X.509 Security Information extension semantics

   SecurityInfo is a CHOICE; it is represented either by NULL or 
   SecurityInformation. If the issuer selects NULL, it indicates that no
   SecurityInfo is provided. If the issuer selects SecurityInfomation, 
   it is explicitly stating that a SecurityInfo is provided, and type 
   SecurityInformation MUST provide details about that SecurityInfo.
   
   SecurityInfomation is a SEQUENCE consisting of three elements: 
   secValidityPeriod, infoTime and secData. It contains all security 
   information of one subject. 

   SecValidityPeriod is provided using the ValidityPeriod type. 
   ValidityPeriod is a SEQUENCE of two GeneralizedTime values. The first
   (notBefore) GeneralizedTime value MUST indicate the date and time 
   that the security information becomes valid, and the second(notAfter)
   GeneralizedTime value MUST indicate the date and time that the 
   security information expires. The period of validity is in months or
   weeks.
   
   InfoTime is a GeneralizedTime. It is recorded when the security 
   information is obtained by the issuer. InfoTime type indicates when 
   the security information is obtained exactly. 
   
   SecData is provided using the SecurityData type. SecurityData is a 
   SEQUENCE containing security protection software and security 
   threats. Software including antivirus, firewall and operating system
   are optional. Security threats MAY be reflected by 
   vulnerabilityDatabase and maliciousPlug-in. Other software that is
   verified being installed in the user can also be added into this 
   sequence. If any of software or threat elements exists in one user,
   its corresponding data type will be selected, then the data type in
   SecurityData MUST provide details of the element. If other 
   unmentioned security data is included in the user, one can only use 
   it after type definition.
   
   Antivirus is provided using the AntivirusData type. AntivirusData 
   MUST contain information about the antivirusBase and MAY contain 
   other antivirus Data that are defined afterwards. AntivirusBase 
   information is provided by BasicInfo type. This sequence records 
   antivirus information, which indicates its antiviral capacity to 
   some extent.

   Firewall is provided using the FirewallData type. FirewallData is a 
   SEQUENCE, it MUST contain firewallBase information and six boolean 
   values, and MAY contain other Firewall Data.
   
   Element firewallBase is also provided using BasicInfo type.

   Element supFTPFileFilter is Boolean. Value one indicates this 
   firewall support FTP (File Transfer Protocol) file filter, and allows
   FTP to prevent certain types of documents through this firewall; 
   value zero is just the opposite.
   
   Element supAntivirus is Boolean. Value one indicates this firewall 
   support antivirus function, such as scanning the attachments of the 
   DOC and ZIP files in E-mails to find dangerous information it may 
   contain; value zero is just the opposite.
   
   Element supConFilter is Boolean. If value of this element is one, 
   it means this firewall support content filter, and MAY control the 
   information flow according to the filter criteria. Filter content 
   mainly refers to the URL, HTTP information--the Subject, To, From 
   domain in Java Applet, JavaScript, ActiveX and e-mail. Value zero 
   indicates the opposite.
   
   Element defDOS is Boolean. Value one indicates this firewall can 
   prevent or reduce the DOS (Denial of Service) attacks to a certain 
   extent, while value zero is the opposite.
   
   Element rtInRes is Boolean. It indicates whether this firewall can 
   provide real-time intrusion prevention function. If value of this 
   element is one, this firewall can adjust the dynamic response when 
   invasion happens, and block malicious message. If value is zero, it 
   indicates this firewall don't support this function. 
   
   Element autoLogScan is Boolean which indicates whether the firewall 
   has automatic analysis and scan log function. If value is one, 
   autoLogScan can obtain detailed log statistical results through 
   scanning. Value zero indicates the opposite.
   
   OtherFirewallData MAY also be added to the sequence, and can be used
   after definition.

   BasicInfo is a SEQUENCE of two IA5Strings and a Boolean value which 
   together specify the basis performance of the certain software. 
   Element version contains version number information of the software.
   Element manufacturer use IA5String to indicate the developer of the
   software. The last element (renewal) MUST indicate whether the 
   corresponding software is up-to-date. For example, an up-to-date 
   KAPERSRY Anti-Virus V5.3 is represented as:
    
     version        =       5.3                                             
     manufacturer   =       KAPERSRY                                        
     renewal        =       1

   OperatingSystem is provided by OSData type, which is an INTEGER 
   because OS data is private. OSData is abstracted as a security score,
   which indicates Operating System security status of the subject. 
   Security score is an integer gained through local scanning of OS 
   data information and specified calculation, ranged in [0, 99]. 
   The bigger the numerical value is, the more safe it will be. OS data 
   information CAN include version, manufacturer, update cycle and 
   so on.
   
   VulnerabilityDatabase is provided by VDDate, which is a BOOLEAN value
   indicates whether the vulnerability database is up-to-date. A value
   of zero indicates the Vulnerability Database of the subject is 
   outdated; a value of one indicates the Vulnerability Database of the 
   subject is up to date, which is safe.
   
   MaliciousPlug-in is provided by MPIData. MPIData is a SEQUENCE 
   contains any defined malicious plug-in with its details, such as 
   name, manufacturer. The more malicious plug-in exists in the user, 
   the less safe it is. 
   
   
3.  Security Considerations 

   This X.509 extension contains private security information, i.e., 
   operation system information, so we abstract it into security scores
   to ensure confidentiality of specific information.
   
   The trusted entity (or a trusted third party) MUST ensure that the 
   correct values for the security information are inserted in each 
   issued certificate, otherwise a user may reject a particular 
   certificate if it encounters information it doesn't recognize or 
   cannot process. 
   
 
4.  IANA Considerations 
   Certificate extensions and extended key usage values are identified   
   by object identifiers (OIDs).  The OIDs used in this document are  
   derived from X.509 [X.509-97].  No further action by the IANA is   
   necessary for this document or any anticipated updates.

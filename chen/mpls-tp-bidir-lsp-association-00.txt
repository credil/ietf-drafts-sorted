1. Introduction 

   Based on the definition of associated bidirectional path in MPLS-TP 
   Requirement [RFC5654], an associated bidirectional path comprises a 
   pair of unidirectional paths which are setup, monitored, and 
   protected independently and are associated with one another at the 
   path's ingress/egress points.  

   [RFC5654] specifies the requirements about associated bidirectional 
   paths in requirement 7, 11, 12: MPLS-TP MUST support associated 
   bidirectional point-to-point transport paths, the end points of an

Internet-Draft       GACH Based Path Association             July 2010 
    

   associated bidirectional path MUST be aware of the pairing 
   relationship of the forward and reverse paths, and intermediate 
   nodes on the path which are transited by both the forward and 
   backward directions SHOULD be aware of the pairing relationship of 
   the forward and the backward directions of the associated 
   bidirectional path.  

   GMPLS based signaling [RFC4974] [RFC4872] [HIERACHY-BIS] may be used 
   (directly or with some extensions) to achieve the association of two 
   unidirectional LSPs.  

   Since MPLS-TP MUST support the capability for network operation 
   without the use of control plane, a method to bind the forward and 
   backward unidirectional paths into an associated bidirectional path 
   in the absence of control plane may be desired. 

   Normally the binding of two unidirectional paths occurs when there 
   are established unidirectional paths in each direction and an 
   associated bidirectional path is needed to provide some kind of 
   service. After the binding of the two unidirectional paths, there 
   MAY be requirement to verify the binding relationship during the 
   lifetime of the associated bidirectional path. In addition, the 
   operator MAY need to update or withdraw the previous binding of the 
   two unidirectional LSPs. 

2. GACH based Path Association 

   This document provides a GACH [RFC5586] based method to achieve the 
   binding of two unidirectional LSPs. A new channel type (TBA) called 
   Path Binding is defined for this purpose. Format of the Path Binding 
   message is as below:

   The definition of Global ID, Node ID, Tunnel Number and LSP Number 
   are specified in [TP-IDENTIFIER]. They are used to identify the 
   unidirectional LSP in each direction and in combination to identify 
   the associated bidirectional LSP. In order to identify the 
   unidirectional LSP in the reverse direction, a Destination LSP 
   Number field is also needed. 

   The source ID fields, i.e. the Source Global ID, Source Node ID, 
   Source Tunnel Number and Source LSP Number MUST be filled in by the 
   local LER with information of the forward LSP. 

   According to different situations, the destination IDs MAY be 
   explicitly specified by the initiating LER, or be set to zero when 
   do not know which reverse LSP to be bound. Detailed procedures are 
   specified in next section. 

3. Operation 

3.1. Binding of Two Unidirectional LSPs 

   One of the LERs initiates the request for the path association by 
   sending a Path Binding Request to the remote LER with flag U and V 
   cleared. The initiating LER SHOULD fill the Bidirectional LSP ID TLV 
   with the IDs of the two unidirectional LSPs to be bound The request 
   message is sent along the forward LSP with the GACH encapsulation. 

   On receipt of a Path Binding Request message, the receiving LER 
   SHOULD check the IDs of the two LSPs to determine if the binding 
   request is acceptable based on local policy and other information. 

 
 
Chen, et al.           Expires January 5, 2011                [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft       GACH Based Path Association             July 2010 
    

   If the binding is accepted, it SHOULD send a Path Binding Response 
   message to the initiating LER with flag U and V cleared and the 
   return code set to 0 (Operation success). If the specified reverse 
   LSP does not exist, or the binding is not acceptable based on its 
   local policy, the receiving LER SHOULD send a Response message with 
   return code 2 (Binding not accepted). The Bidirectional LSP ID TLV 
   MAY be copied from the Request message to the Response message.  

   In some scenarios both LERs MAY send Path Binding Request messages 
   to each other independently, flag U and V MUST be cleared. On 
   receipt of the Path Binding Request message, both LERs SHOULD check 
   the Bidirectional LSP ID TLV of the message. If the binding 
   information in both requests are the same, then the binding is 
   successfully finished, and Response messages SHOULD be sent to 
   remote LER with flag U and V cleared and the return code set to 0 
   (Operation success). If the binding information in one Request 
   message differs from the information in the other Request message, 
   the LER with greater Node ID SHOULD discard the received Request 
   message and MAY send a Response with return code set to 2 (Binding 
   not accepted). Based on local policy and other information, The LER 
   with smaller Node ID SHOULD determine to accept or reject the 
   binding request. If the binding is accepted, the receiving LER 
   SHOULD send a Path Binding Response message with flag U and V 
   cleared and the return code set to 0 (Operation success). Otherwise, 
   the receiving LER SHOULD send a Response message with return code 2 
   (Binding not accepted). The Bidirectional LSP ID TLV MAY be copied 
   from the Request message to the Response message. 

3.2. Binding Relationship Verification 

   After binding the two unidirectional LSP into an associated 
   bidirectional LSP, there MAY be requirement to check the binding 
   relationship, since some configuration errors may change the binding 
   relationship on some nodes. This is achieved using the path binding 
   message. One of the LER SHOULD send a path binding message with 
   message type set to "Request" and the V flag set. The Bidirectional 
   LSP ID TLV specifies the associated bidirectional LSP to be verified. 

   On receipt of the binding Request message with V flag set, the 
   remote LER SHOULD check if the binding relationship in the message 
   is consistent with the local binding relationship. If the binding 
   relationship is consistent, the remote LER SHOULD sent a Response 
   message with V flag set, and the return code set to 0. If there is 
   any inconsistency between the local binding information and the 
   information in the received message, it SHOULD sent a Response 
   message with V flag set, and the return code set to 3 (Binding

   inconsistency). The Bidirectional LSP ID TLV MAY be copied from the 
   Request message to the Response message. 

3.3. Binding Update/Withdrawal 

   When the operator needs to update or withdraw the binding of two 
   unidirectional LSPs, one of the LERs SHOULD send a path binding 
   message with the message type set to "Request", and the U flag MUST 
   be set. If it is to update the binding of forward LSP with another 
   backward LSP, then the Destination ID fields SHOULD be filled with 
   IDs of the new reverse LSP to be bound. If it is to withdraw the 
   current binding, the destination ID fields SHOULD be set to zero. 

   On receipt of the update/withdraw Request message, if the new 
   binding or the withdrawal is accepted, the remote LER SHOULD update 
   local binding relationship, and send a Response message with the U 
   flag set and the return code set to 0. Otherwise it SHOULD send a 
   response message with the U flag set and the return code set to 4 
   (Update/Withdrawal not accepted). The Bidirectional LSP ID TLV MAY 
   be copied from the Request message to the Response message. 

3.4. Association on Intermediate Nodes 

   [RFC5654] specifies that the intermediate nodes traversed by both 
   the forward and backward directions of the associated bidirectional 
   LSP SHOULD be aware of the pairing relationship.  

   In some scenarios the edge nodes may have knowledge of the 
   intermediate nodes traversed by both directions of the associated 
   bidirectional LSP. In this case, after the successful LSP binding on 
   the two edge nodes, the LER with greater Node ID SHOULD send Path 
   Binding Request messages with flag U and V cleared to each 
   intermediate node traversed by both directions. This is achieved by 
   setting the TTL of the topmost label to hop value to the specific 
   intermediate node. The Bidirectional LSP ID TLV MUST be filled with 
   IDs of the forward and backward LSP.  

   On receipt of this message, the intermediate nodes SHOULD interpret 
   this as a path binding notification, since it is not the edge node 
   of the LSPs identified in the Bidirectional LSP ID TLV. Then it 
   SHOULD check if it is on both directions of the associated LSP, if 
   so it SHOULD create the association relationship of the two 
   unidirectional LSPs, if not it SHOULD silently discard the received 
   message. No response is needed from the intermediate node to the 
   initiating node.

Internet-Draft       GACH Based Path Association             July 2010 
    

   In scenarios where the edge nodes do not know the intermediate nodes 
   traversed by both directions of the associated bidirectional LSP, 
   the LER with greater Node ID SHOULD form a Path Binding Request 
   message with the flag U and V cleared. The Bidirectional LSP ID TLV 
   MUST be filled with IDs of the forward and backward LSP. Then the 
   Route Alert Label (label value 1) SHOULD be encapsulated as the 
   topmost label. In this way, each intermediate node will process the 
   message locally and send it further along the path. According to the 
   Bidirectional LSP ID TLV in the message, intermediate nodes which 
   are traversed by both directions will create the association 
   relationship, and nodes not on both directions will not perform the 
   association. 

4. Security Considerations 

   This document does not change the security properties of MPLS-TP. 

   Spurious path binding messages may be used to perform attacks. 
   However, since these messages are carried in a control channel, one 
   would have to gain access to the nodes providing the service to 
   initiate such attack, which makes the threats less likely. To 
   protect against such attack the Authentication TLV MAY be carried in 
   the ACH TLV field. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from registries 
   under its control. 

   A new ACH Channel Type is defined in this document.

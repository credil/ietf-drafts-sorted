Abstract

   This document defines a new ND option, called the NTPS option, that
   contains the Server location information of Network Time Protocol
   version 4[draft-ntpv4] or greater. Therefore, hosts can get such
   information in the same RA message transporting the information of IP
   address configuration. In this spec, both ND transport mechanisms
   (i.e., advertisements and solicitations) are considered.

Internet-Draft   The IPv6 Router Advertisement Option      February 2010
                         for NTP Configuration

1. Introduction

   Beside manual address assignment, several mechanisms have been
   developed to facilitate IPv6 address assignment. One of the most
   convenient methods is Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   [RFC2462]. SLAAC use Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] as an underlining
   protocol. IPv6 host need only connect to a network with an
   advertisement router and periodically receive multicast Router
   Advertisement (RA) on the link. This RA message contains address and
   link information, like IPv6 prefix and link MTU, to configure a
   global unicast address. As a complementary method to provide
   necessary material for an IPv6 host connection to internet and ISP
   management requirement, DNS Server extension has been defined in
   [RFC5006].

   Another address assignment is based on Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6). It has been standardized in [RFC3315].
   Necessary configuration parameters pass from DHCP Server to DHCP
   enabled IPv6 host. This protocol can be used in a stateful way which
   provides address assignment separately or in a stateless way that is
   combination of DHCPv6 and SLAAC. The later case has been specified in
   [RFC3736]. IPv6 Host first configures one or more interfaces through
   SLAAC and then reach stateless DHCP server for additional parameters.

   At the time of writing this spec, the stateless and stateful address
   assignment mechanisms are deployed over networks in an ad hoc way.
   Therefore, an extension in SLAAC normally has an analogue which
   provides similar functionality in DHCP. For instance, Deployment
   scenarios for DNS server address configuration with stateless and
   stateful methods have been compared in [RFC4339]. NTP server
   addresses, just same as DNS server addresses, are common information
   to all IPv6 host in a subnet. [DHCPv6-NTP-Option] proposes a DHCP
   based solution in order to facilitate hosts to access NTP server
   accessing information. The spec introduces an analogue of this
   solution in SLAAC.

3. Terminologies

   RA: Router Advertisement

   RS: Router Solicitation

   NTP: Network Time Protocol

   ND: Neighbor Discovery

   NTPS: NTP Server

   SNTP: Simple Network Time Protocol



4. Requirement for an NTP Server option

   When newly attaching to a network, a host can get essential knowledge
   to configure its IP address via RA messages advertised by a local
   router. Typically, a router advertises RA messages periodically. Also,
   hosts can query RAs using Router Solicitations (RSs). Apart from the
   instruction of IP address configuration, RAs are also used to
   transport other useful information (e.g., IP addresses of DNS
   servers). Same as DNS servers, NTP servers are core components of the
   Internet infrastructure. A NTP server can provide time and
   synchronization services for hosts in the network, which are critical
   for many applications (e.g., security mechanisms). The reasons of
   using RAs to transport the prefix information option based on the ND
   protocol [RFC4861] are very similar with those of using RAs to
   transport the information of DNS servers [RFC5006]:

   1. It is possible for a host to access the nearest NTP server so as
   to reduce the latency imposed by transporting packets.

   2. NTPS option is an extension of RA. This does not change the base
   functions of existing ND/SLAAC mechanism.

   3. All the information a host needs to run the basic Internet
   applications (such as the clock synchronization, timestamp
   verification, certificate expiration check, etc.) can be obtained
   with the addition of this option to ND and address
   autoconfiguration.

   4. The use of a single mechanism is more reliable and easier to
   provide. Debugging problems when multiple protocol mechanisms are
   being used is harder and much more complex.

                         for NTP Configuration
   5. This mechanism works over a broad range of scenarios and leverages
   IPv6 ND.  This works well on links that are high performance (e.g.,
   Ethernet LANs) and low performance (e.g., cellular networks). In the
   latter case, by combining the NTPS information with the other
   information in the RA, the host can learn all the information needed
   to use most Internet applications in a single packet. This not only
   saves bandwidth, but also minimizes the delay needed to learn the
   NTPS information.

   The following figure shows an example topology from this scenario.

5. Neighbor Discovery Extension

   The proposed IPv6 NTP Server configuration mechanism introduces a new
   ND option in Neighbor Discovery called the NTP Server (NTPS) option
   which serves as a container for the Server location information
   related to a NTP Server or a SNTP Server. The analogue of this
   mechanism is proposed in DHCPv6 [DHCPv6-NTP-Option]. The NTPS
   extension option in [DHCPv6-NTP-Option] holds the NTP server address
   information and performs a similar function with the NTPS option in
   this spec. In the future version of this draft, it will reference
   section 6, [DHCPv6-NTP-Option] and include detailed format of NTPS
   option.

6. Interworking among IPv6 NTP Configuration Approaches

   The NTPS (NTP Server) option and DHCP option can be used together. To
   order the RA and DHCP approaches, the O (Other stateful configuration)
   flag can be used in the RA message [RFC4861]. If no NTPS option is
   included in the RA messages, an IPv6 host may perform NTP
   configuration through DHCPv6 [DHCPv6-NTP-Config] regardless of
   whether the O flag is set or not.

7. Security Considerations

   Because NTPS option does not change the base functions of existing
   ND/SLAAC mechanism, it can be claimed that the RA option for NTPS has
   vulnerabilities similar to those existing in current mechanisms. If
   the Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol is used as a security
   mechanism for ND, all the ND options including the NTPS option are
   automatically included in the signatures [RFC3971], so the NTPS
   transport is integrity-protected.



8. IANA Considerations

   The IANA need assign a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option type for
   NTPS option.

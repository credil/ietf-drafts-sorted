Abstract

   BroadVoice(R) [bv-website] is a family of two open-source speech 
   codecs suitable for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  It is 
   designed to achieve high speech quality with relatively low 
   complexity and a very low coding delay.  BroadVoice consists of two 
   variants: a 16 kb/s narrowband codec for 8 kHz sampling called 
   BroadVoice16, or BV16, and a 32 kb/s wideband codec for 16 kHz 
   sampling called BroadVoice32, or BV32.  BV16 and BV32 are standard 
   codecs of PacketCable(TM), SCTE(R), and ANSI for VoIP applications 
   in cable telephony, and they are also listed as optional codecs in 
   the ITU-T Recommendations J.161 and J.361, respectively.  This 
   document describes the BV16 and BV32 speech codecs.

Internet-Draft                  BroadVoice codec              March 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the BroadVoice family of speech codecs, which
   consists of (1) a 16 kb/s narrowband codec called BroadVoice16, or    
   BV16, operating at a sampling rate of 8 kHz, and (2) a 32 kb/s 
   wideband codec called BroadVoice32, or BV32, operating at a sampling 
   rate of 16 kHz.  The BV16 codec was standardized by the cable 
   industry through CableLabs(R) as a standard codec in PacketCable 1.5 
   and PacketCable 2.0. It was also standardized by the Society of Cable 
   Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) and by the American National 
   Standard Institute (ANSI) as the ANSI/SCTE 24-21 2006 standard 
   [bv16-ANSI].  BV16 is also listed as an optional codec in the ITU-T 
   Recommendation J.161. Similarly, BV32 is a standard codec in the 
   following standards: PacketCable 2.0, ANSI/SCTE 24-23 2007 
   [bv32-ANSI], and ITU-T Recommendation J.361.  

   Since the BV16 and BV32 coding algorithms are already specified in 
   details in the ANSI/SCTE standard specification documents, there is 
   no need to repeat the specifications here.  Instead, links to the 
   ANSI/SCTE specification documents for BV16 and BV32 will be given in 
   Sections 3 and 4, respectively.  The rest of this document gives an 
   overview of the BroadVoice family of codecs, their attributes, and 
   other relevant information.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [rfc2119].

2.  Overview of the BroadVoice Family of Codec

   BroadVoice [bv-icassp] is a family of speech codecs developed by
   Broadcom Corporation for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  It is 
   based on Two-Stage Noise Feedback Coding (TSNFC) [tsnfc-icassp] 
   rather than the popular Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) coding
   paradigm.  The RTP [rfc3550] payload formats for BV16 and BV32 are 
   specified in RFC4298.  BV16 and BV32 have very similar codec 
   structures and share most of the algorithm modules, so if the two 
   are implemented together, substantial code sharing and memory 
   reduction can be achieved.

   To encourage wide-spread use of BroadVoice in diverse speech 
   compression applications, Broadcom is providing both the floating-
   point and fixed-point C source code of BroadVoice on a royalty-free
   basis under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 
   2.1, as published by the Free Software Foundation.  Visit 
   http://www.broadcom.com/broadvoice to download BroadVoice open 
   source C code, get audio demonstration, or get relevant information.

   BroadVoice was designed from the ground up to be optimized for voice
   transmission over IP networks.  The main design goal of BroadVoice 
   was to make the coding delay and codec complexity as low as possible 
   while maintaining output speech quality as close to transparent as 
   possible.  The following list summarizes the attributes of BV16 and 
   BV32:

   o  Ultra-low algorithmic buffering delay (5 ms) 

   o  Relatively low computational complexity (about 12 MIPS for BV16
      and 17 MIPS for BV32) and memory requirements

   o  High output quality for voice; acceptable quality for music

   o  Sampling rates of either 8 kHz (for BV16) or 16 kHz (for BV32)

   o  Bit-rate of either 16 kb/s (for BV16) or 32 kb/s (for BV32)

   o  Robustness to packet loss (typically 0.5 MOS degradation at about
      5% random packet loss rate)

   o  Open source implementation (floating-point and fixed-point C)

   o  No known patent enforcement activities or royalty-bearing patent
      pools as of date of submission

   o  BV16 and BV32 are not bit-exact standards; implementation details
      MAY deviate from those specified in the ANSI/SCTE specifications
      for BV16 and BV32 as long as the bit-stream compatibility with the
      ANSI/SCTE BV16 and BV32 standards is maintained.

   It should be noted that some algorithm modules described in the 
   ANSI/SCTE BV16 and BV32 specification documents are meant to 
   illustrate the concepts behind the algorithm modules and may not be 
   the most efficient way to implement the modules.  For example, 
   version 1.1 of the BroadVoice open source code implements some of 
   the efficient excitation vector quantization (VQ) codebook search 
   methods described in [tsnfc-icassp] and [bv-efficient-vq] that are 
   mathematically equivalent to the excitation VQ codebook search
   method described in the ANSI/SCTE BV16 and BV32 specifications but 
   are computationally more efficient.  
	
   Broadcom licenses, on a royalty-free basis, its patents that are 
   necessary to practice techniques used in Broadcom's official version 
   of the BroadVoice open source code.  Implementations that deviate 
   from the techniques used in Broadcom's BroadVoice codecs may increase 
   exposure to third-party patents. Therefore, to minimize potential 
   intellectual property issues, it is RECOMMENDED that implementers of 
   BroadVoice codecs use only techniques implemented in Broadcom's 
   official version of BroadVoice open source C code.

3.  The BroadVoice16 (BV16) Codec

   The BroadVoice16 codec [bv16-asilomar] has a frame size of 5 ms and 
   operates at a sampling rate of 8 kHz.  For every 40 samples of 8 kHz 
   sampled input speech, BV 16 encodes the 40 samples into 80 bits, 
   resulting in a bit rate of 2 bits/sample, or 16 kb/s.

   A detailed description of the encoding and decoding principles of the 
   BV16 codec is given in the ANSI/SCTE 24-21 2006 standard 
   specification document [bv16-ANSI], which is available at the
   following link:   
   
   http://www.scte.org/documents/pdf/Standards/ANSISCTE24212006.pdf
	
   A BV16 decoder MAY include an adaptive postfilter (PF) to reduce the 
   perceived level of coding noise.  It MAY also include packet loss
   Concealment (PLC) to conceal (at least partially) the quality-
   degrading effects of packet loss.  Both PF and PLC are post-
   processing steps after the speech signal is decoded, so they do not 
   affect bit-stream compatibility.  Therefore, PF and PLC are not an
   essential part of the BV16 specification.  The ANSI/SCTE BV16 
   specification describes an example PF and an example PLC scheme,
   but implementers can implement their own PF and PLC schemes without 
   affecting bit-stream compatibility with BroadVoice codecs.

4.  The BroadVoice32 (BV32) Codec

   The BroadVoice32 codec also has a frame size of 5 ms but operates at 
   a sampling rate of 16 kHz.  For every 80 samples of 16 kHz sampled 
   input speech, BV32 encodes the 80 samples into 160 bits, resulting in 
   a bit rate of 2 bits/sample, or 32 kb/s.

   A detailed description of the encoding and decoding principles of the 
   BV32 codec is given in the ANSI/SCTE 24-23 2007 standard 
   specification document [bv32-ANSI], which is available at the
   following link:   
   
   http://www.scte.org/documents/pdf/Standards/ANSI_SCTE24-232007.pdf

   A BV32 decoder MAY include an adaptive postfilter (PF) to reduce the 
   perceived level of coding noise, although it is not really necessary
   because even without a postfilter the output speech quality of BV32
   is already quite high.  A BV32 decoder MAY also include packet loss
   Concealment (PLC) to conceal (at least partially) the quality-
   degrading effects of packet loss.  Both PF and PLC are post-
   processing steps after the speech signal is decoded, so they do not 
   affect bit-stream compatibility.  The ANSI/SCTE BV32 specification 
   describes an example PLC scheme, but implementers can implement 
   their own PLC schemes without affecting bit-stream compatibility.

5.  Security Considerations

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encoding using 
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load. The attacker can inject pathological datagrams 
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver 
   to become overloaded. However, the decoder complexity of BV16 and 
   BV32 do not exhibit any significant non-uniformity.

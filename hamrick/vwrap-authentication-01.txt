               VWRAP Trust Model and User Authentication
                 draft-hamrick-vwrap-authentication-01

Abstract

   Authentication in the Virtual World Region Agent Protocol establishes
   an application layer association between a client application and a
   remote service responsible for managing the end user's identity.  The
   objective of authentication is to verify the user of a client
   application possesses appropriate credentials before granting
   capabilities sufficient to assert control over the user's agent and
   digital assets.

Internet-Draft            VWRAP Authentication                March 2010


1.  Introduction

   Authentication is the first step in associating a client application
   with the agent domain (the remote service responsible for agent
   identity management.)  Before a client application may interact with
   the agent domain or one or more hosts responsible for virtual world
   simulation, it must authenticate itself by presenting credentials
   demonstrating its right to control the agent.  Authentication is the
   process of presenting an "Identifier" and an "Authenticator" to the
   agent domain and receiving a "Seed Capability" providing further
   access to system resources or an actionable error description.  The
   protocol defines an identifier as an agent or account information,
   distinct from its related authenticator.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Agent Login (Resource Class)

2.1.  Introduction

   Authentication begins by requesting the agent_login resource; that
   is, POSTing the "LLSD" description of an identifier and an
   authenticator to a well-known URL.
   [draft-hamrick-vwrap-type-system-00] The agent domain managing this
   resource then makes an access control decision based on the verity of
   the credential and the state of the agent domain.  The result of this
   authentication, whether success or failure, it is returned to the
   client application via a LLSD message.  The content and form of these
   messages are provided below in "LLIDL format."

   The authentication process results in one of seven classes of
   response from the agent domain:

   o  success

   o  deferred success due to maintenance

   o  authentication non-success due to missing secret

   o  authentication failure

   o  agent selection failure




Chu, et al.             Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            VWRAP Authentication                March 2010


   o  "user intervention required" failure, and

   o  "non-specified" failure.

   Responses to authentication requests are successes, non-successes and
   failures.  A "success" indicates the client application should have
   enough information to progress past the authentication phase and
   begin using the service.  A "deferred success" implies use of the
   system will continue after a "short" period.  In either case, the
   agent domain does not expect the client application to re-submit the
   agent_login request.  Authentication "non-success" results from a
   client requesting per-agent or per-account authentication parameters.
   After sending a "non-success", the agent domain expects the client to
   resubmit the agent_login request "shortly."  Failures of all type
   indicate the agent domain believes a condition exists requiring
   explicit user intervention.  In the case of an authentication
   failure, the user should either retry the authentication request or
   recover their password.  A failure due to "user intervention
   required" indicates the agent domain believes the user's account is
   in a state that required "out of band" recovery.  Reading and
   accepting the agent domain's Terms of Service or Critical Messages
   are examples of recovering from "user intervention required"
   failures.  Non-Specified failures indicate a non-recoverable problem
   that is not defined in this specification.

   The section below on Processing Expectations provides more guidance.

2.1.1.  Account identifiers and Agent identifiers

   Client applications may authenticate using an "Account Identifier" or
   an "Agent Identifier".  Either type of identifier may be used for
   authentication.  An agent domain MUST support one of the two types of
   identifiers, and MAY support both.  Client applications SHOULD
   support both identifier types.

   An "Account" is an administrative object holding one or more
   references to an "Agent."  This is advantageous in situations where:

   1.  the agent domain does not wish to use an agent first name and
       last name to identify a user, but wishes to use another
       identifier (such as an email address or account number,) or

   2.  the agent domain wishes to allow users with several agents to
       authenticate with the same authenticator, freeing them from the
       requirement of memorizing each individual agent authenticator.

   Please note this spec does not imply a structure to the account
   identifier.  Though an agent domain may use an email address as an

Internet-Draft            VWRAP Authentication                March 2010


   account identifier, the protocol does not require it and treats the
   identifier simply as an opaque sequence of octets.

2.1.2.  Flexible Authentication

   This revision of the Virtual World Region Agent Protocol defines, but
   does not require the use of, three authentication schemes: hashed
   password, challenge-response and PKCS#5 Key Derivation 2.

2.2.  Service Location

   Each Agent Domain MUST have a well known and published authentication
   URL.

2.3.  Inputs

   LLIDL descriptions are provided below for both agent identifiers and
   account identifiers.  Client applications may use either as the basis
   for authentication.

2.3.1.  Agent Identifier

   An agent identifier contains the first and last name of an agent.

2.3.2.  Account Identifier

   An account identifier must contain the account_name key.  This is the
   opaque sequence of octets used by the agent domain to identify the
   user.  If an account is associated with multiple agents, the client
   application SHOULD include the first_name and last_name of the agent
   the user wishes to use.

2.3.3.  Transport Authentication and Authorization

   The absense of an account or agent identifier SHOULD be interpreted
   to mean that authentication or authorization is carried by the
   transport.  The use of OAuth, TLS client certificates or HTTP
   authentication are examples of transport authentication techniques.
   Compliant implementations are not required to support these
   authentication or authorization using these mechanisms.  However,
   compliant implementations choosing to use transport authentication or
   authorization when requesting a seed capability MUST signify this
   condition by sending an agent_login request without an agent or
   account identifier.

2.3.4.  Hashed Password Authenticator

   When a hashed password is used as an authenticator, the string '$1$'
   is prepended to the UTF-8 encoding of the password and processed with
   the MD5 cryptographic hash function.  [RFC1321] This revision of the
   Virtual World Region Agent Protocol specification requires the use of
   MD5 with the hashed password authenticator.  It also requires the
   presence of the algorithm key, and that the value of this key be the
   string 'md5'.  Note that future versions of this specification may
   ALLOW or REQUIRE the use of other cryptographic hash functions.

2.3.5.  Challenge-Response Authenticator

   The Challenge-Response scheme allows the agent domain to select a
   session specific "Salt" to be used in conjunction with the user's
   password to generate an authenticator.  In this scheme the
   authenticator is the hash of the salt prepended to the hash of '$1$'
   prepended to the password.  This revision of the Virtual World Region
   Agent Protocol specification requires the use of SHA256 with the
   challenge-response authenticator. [sha256] It also requires the
   presence of the algorithm key, and that the value of this key be the
   string 'sha256'.  Note that future versions of this specification may
   ALLOW or REQUIRE the use of other cryptographic hash functions.

   To retrieve a session specific salt for use with the Challenge-
   Response authentication scheme from the agent domain, the client
   application sends a login request with a Challenge-Response
   authenticator without the secret item.  If the agent domain supports
   this authenticator, it MUST respond with a 'key' condition including
   a salt and MAY include a duration in the response.  If the duration
   is present, it denotes the number of seconds for which the salt will
   be valid.

      The Challenge-Response Authentication Scheme is not currently
      deployed on the Second Life Grid.

2.3.6.  PKCS#5 PBKDF2 Authenticator

   The PKCS#5 PBKDF2 authenticator is an implementation of RSA Labs'
   Public Key Cryptographic Standards #5 v2.1 Password Based Key
   Derivation Function #2. [pkcs5] In this scheme, the hash of the
   string '$1$' prepended to the password is used in conjunction with a
   salt, iteration count and hash function to generate an authenticator.
   This revision of the Virtual World Region Agent Protocol
   specification requires the use of SHA256 with the PKCS#5 PBKDS2
   authenticator.  It also requires the presence of the algorithm key,
   and that the value of this key be the string 'sha256'.  Note that
   future versions of this specification may ALLOW or REQUIRE the use of

Internet-Draft            VWRAP Authentication                March 2010


   other cryptographic hash functions.

   As with the Challenge-Response authenticator, the agent domain MUST
   include the salt and iteration count in its response to an
   authentication request that is made without a secret item.
   Conforming agent domains may include a duration in their response
   indicating the number of seconds for which the salt and iteration
   count will be valid.

2.4.  Response

   The response to the agent login message is notice of one of seven
   "conditions":

   o  authentication success

   o  maintenance deferred success

   o  authentication non-success

   o  authentication failure

   o  agent selection failure

   o  "user intervention required" failure, and

   o  "non-specific" failure.

   The specification recognizes three "non-failure" responses:

2.4.1.  Success

   Upon success, the agent domain will respond with a message containing
   the "Agent Seed Capability".  Receipt of this capability indicates
   authentication was successful.  This capability is then used for
   further interactions with the system.

2.4.2.  Maintenance Deferred Success

   This condition indicates per-agent (or per-account) login-time
   maintenance is being performed.  It is not an error.  The response
   includes a maintenance cap the client application should use to get
   information about currently executing maintenance.  For more
   information about maintenance, see the Maintenance section below.

Internet-Draft            VWRAP Authentication                March 2010


2.4.3.  Authentication Non-Success

   Authentication Non-Success is the response given when a client
   queries the agent domain for agent-specific or account-specific
   authentication parameters.  In that it is the expected response to
   such a query, it is not an error or exception.  But it is not an
   indication of successful authentication.

2.5.  Errors and Exceptions

2.5.1.  Authentication Failure

   An authentication failure indicates the client application did not
   provide enough information to authenticate the account or the agent.

2.5.2.  Agent Selection Failure

   An agent selection failure occurs when an account authentication
   request is ambiguous.  In other words, the account a user has
   attempted to use to log in is associated with more than one agent
   account and the client application did not specify which account to
   use.  The response includes a list of first_name / last_name pairs.
   It is expected that the client application will present this list to
   the user and ask which agent to use.

2.5.3.  "User Intervention Required" Failure

   This error indicates that the agent domain cannot authenticate the
   user for non-technical reasons.  The protocol does not attempt to
   describe why, or imply remediation for this error.  But an agent
   domain that returns this response MUST provide a URL containing a
   message describing the condition leading to the error and
   remediation, if known.

2.5.4.  "Non Specific" Failure

   This error indicates some other error exists which does not fall into
   one of the previous six conditions.

2.6.  Preconditions

2.6.1.  Client Preconditions

   It is generally assumed that before a user attempts to log into an
   agent domain, they will not be actively connected to that agent
   domain.

   It is also assumed that the user has registered their account and/or



Chu, et al.             Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            VWRAP Authentication                March 2010


   agent; user registration is outside the scope of this specification.

   The client application SHOULD present the agent domain's Terms of
   Service and Critical Messages and allow a user to accept or decline
   them prior to attempting to authenticate.

2.6.2.  Agent Domain Preconditions

   If the agent domain requires users to read and agree to the Terms of
   Service or acknowledge receipt of Critical Messages prior to
   authentication, it must maintain a record of which accounts and
   agents have accepted and acknowledged these items.

   Agent domains that support the concept of "suspension" or
   "disablement" should also maintain a record of which accounts and
   agents are suspended or disabled.

2.7.  Postconditions

2.7.1.  Client Postconditions

   Following successful authentication, the client application SHOULD
   note that the agent has been authenticated to the agent domain.  The
   Virtual World Region Agent Protocol is NOT stateless.

2.7.2.  Agent Domain Postconditions

   After an agent (or account) is authenticated, a seed capability is
   allocated for the agent.  The agent domain SHOULD maintain the
   association between agent credentials (first_name and last_name) and
   the seed capability so it may be re-used if the client attempts to
   re-authenticate the user.

2.8.  Side Effects

   The agent domain SHOULD maintain the "presence" state of an agent.
   This state should include the agent's seed capability.  If a
   previously authenticated and "present" agent re-authenticates
   successfully, the agent domain MAY return the same seed capability.

   After successful authentication, it is expected that the client will
   issue another request against the seed capability.  To defend against
   potential Denial of Service attacks against the agent domain, the
   agent domain MAY define a timeout period for the seed capability.  If
   the timeout period expires without a request being made against the
   seed capability, that seed capability will expire.  Successful
   authentication of an agent who is "not present" has the effect of
   starting this timer.

Internet-Draft            VWRAP Authentication                March 2010


   The Challenge-Response Authenticator is intended to be used with a
   new, randomly generated salt for each authentication request.  If the
   agent domain supports the Challenge-Response authentication scheme,
   it must maintain the "most recently generated salt" for some period
   of time (generally until the expiration of the duration period given
   in the authentication non-success response.)

   After the salt has "timed out" following an unsuccessful Challenge-
   Response authentication request, the agent domain MUST NOT allow the
   use of a previous or fixed salt value.  That is, it is not correct,
   after the salt has expired, to use a null, fixed or previous salt.
   The agent domain MUST generate a new salt and return it to the client
   application.  An unsuccessful authentication request with the
   Challenge-Response scheme also has the side effect of starting the
   salt duration timer.  When this timer expires, the agent domain MUST
   NOT allow authentication with previously generated salts.

2.9.  Sequence of Events

   It is possible for an authentication request to occur in conditions
   where multiple errors or exceptions COULD be returned.  As the
   protocol does not support reporting multiple failure conditions, the
   following sequence is provided to determine the priority of failure
   conditions.  This sequence of events is motivated by the following
   principles:

   o  The agent domain should leak no account status information to an
      unauthenticated user.

   o  Maintenance should occur after successful authentication and
      before account status checking in case maintenance involves the
      representation of these states by the agent domain.

   o  The agent domain should check for "administrative issues" after
      maintenance is complete.

   The sequence for authentication is as follows.  At the first error,
   the system produces an appropriate error response.

   1.  If the authenticator provided is a Challenge-Response or PKCS#5
       PBKDF2 type AND a secret is not included, the system returns an
       authentication non-success response.

   2.  The secret and optional authentication parameters are used to
       verify the client is in possession of the shared secret.  If
       authentication is unsuccessful, an authentication failure
       response is returned.

   3.  If per-user login-time maintenance must be performed, the agent
       domain allocates a maintenance capability and returns it to the
       client application as a maintenance deferred success response.

   4.  If an account credential was used for authentication and the
       account "contains" two or more agents and the client application
       did not provide the first_name and last_name of the agent to log
       in as, generate a list of all agents associated with this account
       and return an agent selection failure response.

   5.  If an "administrative issue" exists such as the user is
       suspended, banned, must agree to the terms of service or read
       critical messages, the system returns a "user intervention
       required" response, providing a URL referencing a web resource

       steps.

   6.  Check to see if the authenticated agent is associated with an
       agent seed capability already.  If so, return a success response
       referencing that seed capability.

   7.  Start the seed capability timer.  Allocate an agent seed
       capability and return it to the client application via a success
       response.

3.  Login-Time Maintenance (Resource Class)

   An agent domain has the option of performing "per-user, login-time
   maintenance" as part of the authentication sequence.  Performing
   maintenance after a user is authenticated and before an avatar is
   "rezzed" in a region has several advantages:

   o  it reduces system-wide downtime

   o  it distributes maintenance across time, and

   o  it consumes computational resources only for those agents who use
      the system

   The agent domain signals it is performing maintenance by returning a
   "Maintenance Capability" instead of a seed capability following
   successful authentication.  The maintenance capability represents a
   finite sequence of transactions performed by the agent domain on the
   user's behalf.  It is expected that maintenance is a task that will
   complete in a "tractable" amount of time.

   The maintenance capability may be queried to retrieve information
   about the transactions that are occuring, including:

   o  a textual description of the maintenance being performed

   o  an estimate for how long the maintenance will take to complete

3.1.  Service Location

   The agent domain may provide a maintenance capability to the client
   application in response to successful authentication.  This
   capability is communicated as an URL to a web based service that
   accepts LLSD queries.
   'maintenance' capability from

3.2.  Verb
   GET

3.3.  Inputs

   There are no parameters to a maintenance capability request.

3.4.  Response

   There are three responses to a maintenance capability: a description
   of ongoing maintenance, a new maintenance capability describing
   another sequence of maintenance transactions, or a seed capability.
   These responses are identified with the condition items: 'ongoing',
   'next' and 'complete'.

   The 'ongoing' response to a maintenance capability request includes a
   simple textual description of the maintenance performed, an estimate
   for how long the maintenance is expected to take, and a validity
   duration for the capability.  The estimate for how long maintenance
   will take is provided so client applications may provide feedback to
   the user.  The validity duration gives the viewer a minimim time
   period the agent domain will maintain the maintenance capability.

   When the agent domain returns a 'next' response, it indicates that
   the current maintenance is complete, but a new maintenance must be
   performed before the agent may be placed into a region.  The 'next'
   response includes the URL of the next maintenance capability as well
   as an integer describing the minimum time period the agent domain
   will maintain the maintenance capability.

   When an agent domain returns a 'complete' response, it indicates that
   all maintenance is complete.  The response includes the agent seed
   capability that may be used to place the user's avatar in a region.
   It also includes an item describing the validity period for the
   current maintenance capability.

4.  Security Considerations

   RFC 3552 [RFC3552] describes several aspects to use when evaluating
   the security of a specification or implementation.  We believe most
   common security concerns users of this specification will encounter
   are more appropriately considered as transport, network or link layer
   issues.  However, the following "application security" issues should
   be considered.

   The MD5 cryptographic hash functions has been deprecated and SHOULD
   be used only for compatibility with older applications.

   The use of the hashed password authenticator could result in a replay
   attack if not used in conjunction with an appropriate confidentiality
   preserving transport.  Implementations using the hashed password
   authenticator SHOULD utilize appropriate encryption schemes such as
   TLS [RFC5246] or S/MIME [RFC3851].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

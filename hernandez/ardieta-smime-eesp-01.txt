Abstract

This document defines extended electronic signature policies (ext-SP) 
that extend the boundaries of the electronic signature policy defined in
[RFC3125] in a manner that the relationships and dependences among 
multiple electronic signatures generated within the scope of the same 
electronic transaction can be established. A given legal/contractual 
context may recognize a particular ext-SP as meeting its requirements. 

An ext-SP has a globally unique reference, which is bound to an 
electronic signature by the signer as part of the signature calculation. 

The ext-SP can be defined in human readable form so that it can be 
assessed to meet the requirements of the legal and contractual context 
in which it is being applied.

To allow for the automatic processing, the ext-SP specifies, using a 
computer processable form, the timing and sequence dependencies of the 
set of signatures that must be generated to make the transaction 
effective along with the set of attributes and rules that each signature
must comply with.  In the current document the format of the ext-SP is 
defined using ASN.1.

Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011


1.  Introduction

An electronic signature policy, as defined in [RFC3125], is a document 
that collects a set of rules to create and validate electronic signatu-
res, under which an electronic signature can be deemed valid in a parti-
cular transaction context. Thereby, transacting parties are able to 
determine the conditions under which an electronic signature becomes 
binding in a given business context. The policy is used by the signer in 
order to generate the signature according to its requirements. 
Afterwards, the verifier must use the policy to decide whether the 
signature is valid or not. 

However, the increase of paper-based processes being transposed into the
digital realm makes current signature policy definition insufficient to
cope with the new needs that arise. Frenquently, documents require more
than one signature to give it legal validity or to make a transaction 
effective. For instance, a transaction where a contract of sale is to 
be signed may be considered complete if and only if the signature of 
both buyer and seller is present. Sometimes, the signature of an 
e-notary on each signature may be required as well.
   
This document extends the boundaries of the electronic signature policy 
defined in [RFC3125] in order to permit the establishment of the 
relationships and dependencies of multiple signatures that are required 
to make a transaction effective. In this document, extended electronic 
signature policies (ext-SP) are defined, using an approach based on 
three different levels of abstraction:

- Business Level. The first level defines the business and transactional 
context that apply to the electronic signatures generated according to 
the ext-SP.
- Inter-relationships Level. The second level establishes the set of 
electronic signatures that must be present in order to give legal 
effectiveness to the transaction as well as the relationships and 
dependences that are accepted among these signatures.
- Atomic Level. In the third level, the requirements to be fulfilled by 
each electronic signature are defined. In practice, this level is 
implemented by signature policies as defined in [RFC3125]. 

Any electronic signature generated under the conditions established in 
an ext-SP must not be deemed valid, and, therefore, the commitments made
by the signer enforced, until the complete set of signatures defined in
the ext-SP content has been correctly generated. 

This document is intended to cover extended electronic signature 
policies that can be used with electronic signatures for various types 
of transactions, including business transactions (e.g. purchase 
requisition, contract, and invoice applications). Electronic signatures 
can be used for any transaction between an individual and a company,
between two companies, between an individual and a governmental 
body, etc.  This document is independent of any environment. It can be  



Hernandez-Ardieta, et al.     Expires December 19, 2011         [Page 4]
Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011


applied to any environment e.g., e-commerce, e-Government, contract
signing etc.

The definition of the ext-SP is contained in next Sections. Appendix A 
contains the ASN.1 module. 

In this document we refer to current signature policy definition 
[RFC3125] as signature policy, and to the policy defined herein, the 
extended signature policy or ext-SP.   

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Major Parties

   The document uses the following terms:

      *  the Signature Policy Issuer;
      *  the Extended Signature Policy Issuer;
      *  the Signer;
      *  the Verifier;
      *  the Arbitrator;
      *  Trusted Service Providers (TSP);

The Signature Policy Issuer (which is a Trusted Service Provider (TSP)) 
issues signatures policies [RFC3125] that define the technical and 
procedural requirements for electronic signature creation, and 
validation/ verification, in order to meet a particular business need.

The Extended Signature Policy Issuer (which is a Trusted Service 
Provider (TSP)) issues extended signatures policies that define the 
relationships and dependencies between the electronic signatures 
required in order to meet a particular business need.

The Signer is the entity that creates one or more electronic signatures 
represented in the ext-SP content.  The signer MUST digitally sign over 
a signature policy identifier and an extended signature policy 
identifier. In the case of the signature policy reference, it represents
a commitment on behalf of the signing entity that the data being signed
is signed under the rules defined by the signature policy. In the case 
of the extended signature policy, it assures that the signer MUST NOT be
held liable for any commitment made in such signature until the rest of 
electronic signatures identified in the ext-SP content have been 
correctly generated.

The Verifier is the entity that validates a partial or complete set of 
signatures according to the content of the ext-SP. The verifier MUST
validate the set of electronic signature under the rules defined by the 
ext-SP, and each electronic signature according to the rules established
in the corresponding signature policy in order to conclude that the set 
of signatures is valid, and thus each signer can be held liable for the 


Hernandez-Ardieta, et al.     Expires December 19, 2011         [Page 5]
Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011


commitments made. The verifier may be a single entity or multiple 
entities.  

An Arbitrator is an entity that arbitrates disputes between a signer or 
signers, and a verifier.  It acts as verifier when it verifies the set 
of signatures taking into account the referenced signature policies and 
extended signature policy.

The Trusted Service Providers (TSPs) are one or more entities that help 
to build trust relationships between the signer and verifier. Use of TSP 
specific services MAY be mandated by the signature policies referenced 
from the ext-SP content. TSP supporting services include: user 
certificates, cross-certificates, time-stamping tokens,CRLs, ARLs, OCSP 
responses.

A Trusted Service Providers (TSPs) MAY be a Signature Policy Issuer, or 
an Extended Signature Policy Issuer. 

3.  Extended Signature Policy Specification

An extended signature policy (ext-SP) specification includes general 
information about the policy, the relationships and conditions among the 
electronic signatures to be generated in the electronic transaction, and 
the transactional and business context, among other information.

This document mandates that:

   *  an electronic signature must be processed by the signer and
      verifier in accordance with the signature policy and the extended
      electronic signature referenced by the signer;
   *  the signature policy referenced by the signer must be identifiable
      by an Object Identifier;
   *  the extended signature policy referenced by the signer must be
      identifiable by an Object Identifier;
   *  there must exist a specification of every signature policy 
      referenced from the extended signature policy;
   *  there must exist a specification of the extended signature policy;
   *  for a given signature policy there must be one definitive form
      of the specification which has a unique binary encoding; 
   *  for a given extended signature policy there must be one definitive
      form of the specification which has a unique binary encoding;
   *  a hash of the definitive specification, using an agreed algorithm,
      must be provided by the signer and checked by the verifier.

This document defines but does not mandate the form of the ext-SP 
specification.  The signature policy may be specified either:

      *  in a free form document for human interpretation; or
      *  in a structured form using an agreed syntax and encoding.

This document defines an ASN.1 based syntax that may be used to define a
structured signature policy.  Future versions of this document may 
include an ext-SP specification using XML.

Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011


3.1  Overall ASN.1 Structure

The overall structure of an ext-SP defined using ASN.1 is given in this 
Section.  Use of this ASN.1 structure is optional.

This ASN.1 syntax is encoded using the Distinguished Encoding Rules 
(DER). 

ExtSignaturePolicy ::= SEQUENCE {
  extSignPolicyInfo       ExtSignPolicyInfo,
  extSignPolicyProtection ExtSignPolicyProtection OPTIONAL
}

The whole information about the ext-SP is collected in the 
extSignPolicyInfo field , which ASN.1 structure is defined as follows:

ExtSignPolicyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
  extSignPolicyIdentifier ExtSignPolicyIdentifier,
  extSignValidationPolicy ExtSignValidationPolicy,
  extSignContext          [0] ExtSignContext OPTIONAL,
  extSignPolExtensions    [1] SignPolExtensions OPTIONAL
}

On the other hand, extSignPolicyProtection field includes the 
information about the cryptographic algorithm applied to protect the 
ext-SP, as well as the cryptographic result after applying such 
algorithm. If this field is not included in the ext-SP, then an external 
protection mechanism MUST be used by the parties when transmitting the 
ext-SP through insecure means. 

ExtSignPolicyProtection type is defined as follows:

ExtSignPolicyProtection ::= SEQUENCE {
  protectionAlg AlgorithmIdentifier,
  protection    BIT STRING
}

The protection algorithm, defined in protectionAlg field 
(AlgorithmIdentifier ASN.1 type, as defined in [RFC5280]) must be 
applied on the DER encoding [X.690] of the extSignPolicyInfo field. 
Different cryptographic algorithms could be used, like hash functions or
digital signature algorithms. The ext-SP MUST be protected by other 
means if the applied protection algorithm does not suffice in certain 
circumstances (see Section 6.2). If a hash function is used, the hash 
MUST be calculated without the outer type and length fields, and the 
value obtained MUST be encoded in the protection field. If a digital 
signature algorithm is used (e.g. sha1withRSAEncryption), then the 
requirements for hash functions applies, and the digital signature value 
MUST be encoded in the protection field. In this case, the digital 
certificate that wraps the public key corresponding to the signing 
private key MUST be provided by other means. The subjectDN field of the 
certificate SHOULD correspond to the policyIssuerName further defined.


Hernandez-Ardieta, et al.     Expires December 19, 2011         [Page 7]
Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011


The next Sections describe the fields indicated in the ExtSignPolicyInfo
ASN.1 type. An optional extension field named extSignPolExtensions of 
SignPolExtensions ASN.1 type (as defined in [RFC3125]) is included for 
future needs in most of ASN.1 types defined in this document.

3.2  Extended Signature Policy Identifier

The ext-SP must be uniquely identified by both signers and verifiers. 
The extSignPolicyIdentifier field of ExtSignPolicyIdentifier ASN.1 type 
is included for that purpose:

ExtSignPolicyIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
  extSignPolicyId        ExtSignPolicyId,
  dateOfIssue            GeneralizedTime,
  policyIssuerName       PolicyIssuerName,
  extSigPolicyQualifiers [0] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF 
                             SigPolicyQualifierInfo OPTIONAL,
  extSignPolExtensions   [1] SignPolExtensions OPTIONAL              
}

ExtSignPolicyId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

PolicyIssuerName ::= GeneralNames

The extSignPolicyId field is an Object Identifier (OID) that uniquely 
identifies this ext-SP among all policies issued by the issuer 
identified by policyIssuerName field.

The dateOfIssue field indicates the date when this policy was issued.

The policyIssuerName field identifies the extended electronic signature 
policy issuer in one or more of the general name forms.

The extSigPolicyQualifiers field includes additional qualifying 
information, like the location where the ext-SP can be retrieved from. 
SigPolicyQualifierInfo ASN.1 type is defined in [RFC5126]. 

The extSignPolExtensions is a generic way to extend the definition of 
any sub-component of an extended signature policy.

3.3  Validation Policy

The ExtSignValidationPolicy is the core of the ext-SP, and describes the
rules and conditions to be fulfilled by the set of signatures in order 
to give effectiveness to the transaction.

The validation policy provides signers with the information to generate 
an electronic signature according to the requirements established in the
atomic and inter-relationships levels, and within the scope of the 
transaction and business context specified in the business level of the 
ext-SP.



Hernandez-Ardieta, et al.     Expires December 19, 2011         [Page 8]
Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011


The validation policy also provides verifiers and arbitrators the 
information to ascertain whether a set of electronic signatures 
generated according to a given ext-SP are complete and valid.

The validation policy is described as follows:

ExtSignValidationPolicy ::= SEQUENCE {
  signingPeriod        [0] SigningPeriod,
  treesOfSolutions     [1] TreesOfSolutions,
  extSignPolExtensions [2] SignPolExtensions OPTIONAL                                 
}

SigningPeriod ::= SEQUENCE {
  notBefore             GeneralizedTime,
  notAfter              GeneralizedTime OPTIONAL
}

The signingPeriod identifies the date and time before which the ext-SP 
MUST NOT be used for creating signatures, and an optional date after 
which it MUST NOT be used for creating signatures. It should be noted 
that a set of signatures created under a valid ext-SP can still be 
verified against the policy after its expiration date.

The treesOfSolutions field, detailed in Section 3.3.1, contains a set of
graphs where each one represents a tree of signatures that defines the 
dependences and relationships among them. This field implements the 
Inter-relationships Level mentioned in the Introduction of this 
document.

3.3.1  Trees of Solutions

A set of signatures MAY consist of the next types of electronic 
signatures:

- Parallel signatures, which are applied on the same piece of 
information. They are mutually independent signatures where the order of 
the signatures is not important. For instance, a document may be 
electronically signed by two or more parties, like in a contract sale 
example.
- Sequential signatures, which differ from parallel signatures in that 
the order is significant (e.g. a data flow or transaction chain).
- Embedded signatures, where one signature is applied to another. The 
sequence in which the signatures are applied is important and there is a
strong interrelationship. An example is a process where an electronic 
signature must be signed (authorized) by another (e.g. an e-notary 
signature applied to another).


A set of signatures can thus derive in a tree graph. A tree is a 
connected graph with n vertices (nodes) and n-1 edges, and where there 
are no cycles. In particular, the tree that represents the set of 
signatures has the next specific properties:


Hernandez-Ardieta, et al.     Expires December 19, 2011         [Page 9]
Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011


- The tree is a rooted tree in which the root node (level 0) represents 
the original signed document and the rest of nodes correspond to 
signatures. 
- The edges have a natural orientation away from the root. The tree 
expands from the root towards the leaf nodes, which are nodes with no 
child. 
- The graph is unweighted, that is, there are no edge weights.
- The tree is irregular: each node (signature) not being a leaf node can
have a different positive degree, that is, it can have as many children 
as needed. Leaf nodes have positive degree 0.
- Every node has a negative degree 1 (number of parent nodes), except 
the root node which has negative degree 0.

Next Figure depicts an example of a set of signatures in tree form:

   -----------
   |SignedData|
   -----------
        |
        |
-----------------
|       |       |
\/      \/      \/
PS1     PS2     PS3
         |
         |
       ------
       |    |
       \/   \/
      CS1  CS2

Electronic signatures in level 1 of the tree correspond to primary 
signatures (PS), which are either parallel or sequential signatures. 

The rest of signatures correspond to countersignatures (CS), which are 
embedded signatures that can be applied to either a PS or another CS. 
Besides, signatures which are children of the same parent behave as PS 
among them. The difference is that the signatures are applied to another
signature instead of the document. 

In the example above, the tree graph represents a set of signatures 
where there are three primary signatures generated over the root node 
(SignedData), and two countersignatures generated over the second 
primary signature. Though the arrows are shown following a top-down 
direction, a signature in level n is applied to the parent signature in 
level n-1.

In certain scenarios, more than one tree of signatures can make the same
transaction be legally effective. E.g. in fair exchange and fair non-
repudiation protocols, a transaction can be finished (becomes effective)
either by completing the main protocol or one of the specified 
subprotocols. Many other scenarios can be customized to follow this 


Hernandez-Ardieta, et al.     Expires December 19, 2011        [Page 10]
Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011

approach. For instance, an e-commerce protocol where two parties must 
sign a document can decide to either countersigning each others 
signature or let an authorized e-notary to do it.

In order to support this type of transactions, the Trees of Solutions 
(TSo) consists of a sequence of trees, each of which (named TSi) as 
represented in previous Figure. During the validation stage, the 
verifier must check if the evaluated set of signatures matches one of 
the trees defined in TSo. The transaction is made effective provided 
that one TSi is completely satisfied.

TreesOfSolutions ::= SEQUENCE OF treeOfSignatures TreeOfSignatures

TreeOfSignatures ::= SEQUENCE OF signature Signature


The Signature ASN.1 type defines the information of a particular node 
(signature) in a tree of signatures:  

Signature ::= SEQUENCE {
  identifier             INTEGER (0..MAX),
  signer                 INTEGER (0..MAX),
  acceptableSignPolicies AcceptableSignPolicies,  
  allowedCommitmentTypes SelectedCommitmentTypes,
  counterSignatures      [0] TreeOfSignatures OPTIONAL,
  timingAndSequence      [1] TimingAndSequence OPTIONAL,
  extSignPolExtensions   [2] SignPolExtensions OPTIONAL                             
}

Each node (signature) is uniquely identified by the identifier field. 
This information is used to specify timing and sequence dependences, 
further explained. The signer that must perform this signature is 
uniquely represented in a figurative sense by the signer field. No 
signer specific information MUST be used (e.g. subject distinguished 
name or subject alternative name) as the ext-SP issuer does not know a 
priori which signer will actually perform the signature. A signer MAY 
appear in as many signatures of the tree as needed, but signatures to be
generated by different signers MUST contain different signer values.

AcceptableSignPolicies ::= SEQUENCE OF signPolicyId SignPolicyId

SignPolicyId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

The acceptableSignPolicies field contains the signature policies (SP) 
OIDs [RFC3125] that can be used by the signer when creating this 
signature. This field implements the Atomic Level mentioned in the 
Introduction of this document.

The allowedCommitmentTypes field restricts the commitment types that can
be assumed by the signer when producing this specific signature. This 
field is of SelectedCommitmentTypes ASN.1 type, as defined in [RFC3125].
These commitment types must be consistent with those included in the 
acceptable signature policies herein indicated.

Each signature can have a finite number of child nodes, which are 
represented by a TreeOfSignatures in the counterSignatures field. As a 
result, the tree is represented by following a recursive method, in 
which the leaf nodes of the tree will not have the counterSignatures 
field.

TimingAndSequence ::= CHOICE {
  absoluteTimingAndSequence [0] SigningPeriod,
  relativeTimingAndSequence [1] SEQUENCE OF RelativeTimingAndSequence
}

The time frame during which a signature must be generated and the 
sequential relationships with other signatures are described in 
timingAndSequence field.

The TimingAndSequence type supports the specification of sequential 
signatures. It allows any signature to have as many timing and sequence 
dependences on other signatures as needed. There are three 
possibilities:

- A signature has no actual dependence on any other signature (e.g. 
primary signatures).
- A signature has no dependence on other signatures but it must be 
performed within a period of time (e.g. a primary signature to be 
performed not before 17/07/1997 00:00:00 GMT and not after 17/07/2007 
00:00:00 GMT). We define this dependence as an absolute dependence.
- A signature has certain dependences on other signatures, either 
sequential or embedded. These are considered as relative dependences.

The first case is achieved by omitting the timingAndSequence field of 
Signature type above. The second case is implemented by selecting 
absoluteTimingAndSequence field in TimingAndSequence type. To define one
or more relative dependences, the relativeTimingAndSequence field must 
be selected, which ASN.1 type is the next:

RelativeTimingAndSequence ::= SEQUENCE {
  pathToRefSignature SEQUENCE OF INTEGER,
  maxDelta           DeltaTime  OPTIONAL
}

The pathToRefSignature field indicates the path of node identifier field
values from a signature located in level one of the tree to the 
signature with which there is timing and sequence dependence. The 
maxDelta field indicates the maximum time delay allowed from the 
referenced signature's signing time during which this signature can be 
performed. That is, this signature must be performed in a period of time
defined by [t0, t0 + maxDelta] where t0 is the referenced signature's 
signing time. If this field is omitted, it means that this signature 
must be generated after the referenced signature but with no time limit. 

In order to obtain accurate and reliable time references, signatures 
SHOULD be time stamped, following the requirements specified in the 
TimestampTrustCondition ASN.1 type [RFC3125].

3.4  Business and Transactional Domains

The context in which the extended signature policy applies is defined in
the field extSignContext of ExtSignPolicyInfo ASN.1 structure. This 
field is of ExtSignContext type, and implements the Business Level 
mentioned in the Introduction of this document.

ExtSignContext ::= SEQUENCE {
  businessApplicationDomain [0] SigPolicyQualifierInfo OPTIONAL,
  transactionalContext      [1] SigPolicyQualifierInfo OPTIONAL,
  disputeResolution         [2] SigPolicyQualifierInfo OPTIONAL,                               
  audienceConditions        [3] SigPolicyQualifierInfo OPTIONAL,
  extSignPolExtensions      [4] SignPolExtensions OPTIONAL                                
}

The businessApplicationDomain field outlines the business domain in 
which the ext-SP is suitable for use, e.g. sale of goods/international 
trade transactions, e-Government transactions between citizens and e-
Administration, e-health services, etc. It covers high-level and sector-
oriented domains. On the contrary, the transactionalContext field 
provides additional information about the transactional context (e.g. 
draft of a contract, purchase by means of online service, exchange of 
design documents, etc.). This information SHOULD match with the 
fieldOfApplication field of each signature policy, described in 
SignPolicyInfo ASN.1 type in [RFC3125]. 

Disputes on a specific event or action taken by any party in a 
transaction may arise in a future. A dispute must be resolved by a third
party with authority to do so, taking as information for the resolution 
the evidence generated in the transaction. Electronic signatures may act
as non-repudiation evidence if adequate policies used by the parties 
enforce them. In that case, the third party must consider if the 
conditions established for the transactions have been fulfilled by the 
parties. The dispute resolution procedures are contained in the 
disputeResolution field. It allows the ext-SP issuer to specify a 
binding text to be considered by the parties when using this policy for 
generating and validating signatures, and by the third party for 
resolving a dispute. 

Finally, audienceConditions states the conditions under which a 
signature may be relied upon, e.g. the signature only valid in a 
specified jurisdiction, where laws exist which recognize the legal 
validity of signatures created under conditions as specified in the 
policy. This field may include provisions relating to the intended 
effectiveness of signatures, where multiple signatures are required, 
e.g. the signature must be countersigned to be relied upon.

Each field, except extSignPolExtensions field, is of 
SigPolicyQualifierInfo ASN.1 type, defined in [RFC5126]. Therefore, the 
information for each field could be available at a Web URI or URL 
reference (specified by SPuri type of qualifier), or explicitly 
contained in the qualifier through the SPUserNotice qualifier, which may

contain a reference to the organization notice and an explicit text. 
Please refer to Section 5.8.1 of [IETF:RFC5126] for further information.

3.5  Signing Roles

A signing role is a role allocated to or adopted by a signer, and which 
defines the relationship between its signature and the rest of 
signatures [TR102045]. A signing role is mainly a Primary Signature (PS)
or a CounterSignature (CS). 

In this document, the signing role is implicitly assigned to a signer by
means of the position that his corresponding signature has in the 
concrete tree of signatures (TSi). Therefore, a signature mapped to a 
node in level one of TSi implies that the signer is assuming a PS 
signing role. Otherwise, the signing role is a CS. This behavior 
completely satisfies the requirements respecting signing roles given in 
Section 9.4.1 of [TR102045].

3.6  Extended Signature Policy Extensions

Additional information MAY be added to:

*  the overall extended signature policy structure, as defined in 
section 3.1;
*  the extended signature policy identifier structure, as defined in 
section 3.2;
*  the validation policy structure, as defined in section 3.3;
*  the signature structure, as defined in section 3.3.1;
*  the extended signature context structure, as defined in section 3.4.

These extensions to the structures of the extended signature policy must 
be defined using ASN.1 syntax with an associated object identifier 
carried in the SignPolExtn as defined below:

SignPolExtensions ::= SEQUENCE OF SignPolExtn

SignPolExtn ::= SEQUENCE {
  extnID                OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
  extnValue             OCTET STRING  
}

The extnID field must contain the object identifier for the extension. 
The extnValue field must contain the DER (see ITU-T Recommendation X.690
[X.690]) encoded value of the extension.  The definition of an 
extension, as identified by extnID must include a definition of the 
syntax and semantics of the extension.

4.  Validity Conditions

For validation purposes, it could be used any tree matching algorithm, 
or a different approach, capable of verifying the correctness and 
validity of a set of signatures against the requirements imposed in the 
extended signature policy, and, in particular, the trees of signatures 
defined in the tree of solutions field.

Hernandez-Ardieta, et al.     Expires December 19, 2011        [Page 14]
Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011


In this sense, a set of signatures (SSi) is compliant with an extended 
signature policy if at least one tree of signatures (TSi) is completely 
satisfied. A TSi is satisfied if the number of signatures in the SSi 
and nodes in one TSi are the same, and the structure of both graphs is 
the same (homomorphic graphs). Besides, after having applied the 
validation algorithm, every signature of SSi MUST be mapped to only one 
node of the satisfied TSi, every node of such TSi MUST be mapped to only
one signature of SSi, and no signature of SSi nor node of TSi MUST be 
without a mapping.

The SSi can be complete - every signature needed to complete the 
transaction has been generated (TSi completely satisfied) - or 
incomplete - there are still some required signatures left (TSi 
partially satisfied).

Besides, every signature of the SSi MUST be validated against the rules 
imposed in the signature policy to which it adheres.

5.  Integration in AdES formats

Advanced Electronic Signature Formats (AdES) like CAdES [RFC5126] have 
adopted the inclusion of the signature policy reference as a signed 
attribute in their EPES version. By signing over the signature policy 
identifier, the signer explicitly indicates that he has applied the 
signature policy in creating the signature. The verifier is also able to
retrieve the referenced signature policy content and thus validate the 
signature accordingly. In order to unambiguously identify the referenced 
signature policy that is to be used to verify the signature, the signed 
attribute includes an identifier unique in the domain of the signature 
policy issuer and a hash of the signature policy document. 

In order to support the usage of extended signature policies in the same
way, signed attribute extended-signature-policy-identifier is defined. 

The object identifier for this attribute is:

id-aa-ets-extSigPolicyId  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) smime(16) id-aa(2) 49 }

extended-signature-policy-identifier attribute values have ASN.1 type 
SignaturePolicyIdentifier, as defined in [RFC5126]:

ExtSignaturePolicyIdentifier ::= SignaturePolicyIdentifier

SignaturePolicyIdentifier ::= CHOICE {
  SignaturePolicyId      SignaturePolicyId,
  SignaturePolicyImplied SignaturePolicyImplied   
}






Hernandez-Ardieta, et al.     Expires December 19, 2011        [Page 15]
Internet Draft   Extended Electronic Signature Policies        June 2011


SignaturePolicyId ::= SEQUENCE {
  sigPolicyId           SigPolicyId,
  sigPolicyHash         SigPolicyHash,
  sigPolicyQualifiers   SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF SigPolicyQualifierInfo
  OPTIONAL}


SignaturePolicyImplied ::= NULL

6.  Security Considerations

6.1  Protection of Private Key

The reliability of an electronic signature highly depends on the 
diligence to protect the privacy and access to the signer's private key.
Implementations must take steps to ensure, with a sufficient level of 
guarantee, that private keys cannot be compromised or used without 
proper authorization.

6.2  Extended Signature Policy Protection

When a signer or verifier obtains a copy of the extended signature 
policy (ext-SP) from an issuer, the source SHOULD be authenticated and 
the integrity of the ext-SP content verified. For this purpose, it is 
RECOMMENDED to use the field extSignPolicyProtection. Otherwise, other 
means SHOULD be used to assure the integrity and authenticity of the 
ext-SP. 

It is RECOMMENDED to use digital signatures to adequately protect the 
ext-SP. A hash value calculated over the policy content does not prevent
an attacker from modifying it if the ext-SP is transmitted through 
insecure means, like a TCP/IP connection without SSL/TLS. If a protected
and authenticated channel is used, the hash value MAY be used by the 
signer to verify the integrity of the policy content by:

- Performing his own computation of the hash on the DER encoding of the 
extSignPolicyInfo field, and using the hash algorithm indicated in the 
field protectionAlg indicated in the extSignPolicyProtection field.
- Verifying that the value obtained matches the value encoded in the 
protection field of the extSignPolicyProtection.

Besides, when the signer references an extended signature policy the 
object identifier (OID) of the policy, the hash value and the hash 
algorithm OID of that policy must be included in the electronic 
signature.

It is a mandatory requirement of this document that the extended 
signature policy value computes to one, and only one hash value using 
the specified hash algorithm.  This means that there must be a single 
binary value of the encoded form of the extended signature policy for 
the unique hash value to be calculated.  For example, there may exist a 
particular file type, length and format on which the hash value is

calculated which is fixed and definitive for a particular extended 
signature policy.

Abstract

    This document describes a TCP sender algorithm to trigger loss
    recovery based on the information gathered on a SACK scoreboard
    instead of simply counting the number of arriving duplicate
    acknowledgements in the traditional way. The given algorithm is more
    robust to ACK losses, ACK reordering, missed duplicate
    acknowledgements due to delayed acknowledgements, and extra
    duplicate acknowledgements due to duplicated segments and out-of-
    window segments. The algorithm allows not only a timely initiation
    of TCP loss recovery but also reduces false fast retransmits.  It
    has a low implementation cost on top of the SACK scoreboard defined
    in RFC 3517.

1.  Introduction

    The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC793] has two methods for
    triggering retransmissions.  First, the TCP sender relies on
    incoming duplicate acknowledgement (ACKs) [RFC2581bis], indicating
    receipt of out-of-order segments at the TCP receiver. After
    receiving a required number of duplicate ACKs (usually three), the
    TCP sender retransmits the first unacknowledged segment and
    continues with a fast recovery algorithm such as Reno [RFC2581],
    NewReno [RFC3782] or SACK-based loss recovery [RFC3517].  Second,
    the TCP sender maintains a retransmission timer that triggers
    retransmission of segments, if the retransmission timer expires
    before the segments have been acknowledged.

    While the conservative loss recovery algorithm defined in [RFC3517]
    takes full advantage of SACK information during a loss recovery, it
    does not consider the very same information during the pre-recovery
    detection phase. Instead, it simply counts the number of arriving
    duplicate ACKs and leans on the number of duplicate ACKs in deciding
    when to enter loss recovery. However, this traditional heuristics of
    simply counting the number of duplicate ACKs to trigger a loss
    recovery fails in several cases to determine correctly the actual
    number of valid out-of-order segments the receiver has successfully
    received.  First, trusting on duplicate ACKs alone utterly fails to
    get hold of the whole picture in case of ACK losses and ACK
    reordering, resulting in delayed or missed initiation of fast



Jarvinen/Kojo                                       Section 1.  [Page 4]

    retransmit and fast recovery. Similarly, the delayed ACK mechanism
    tends to conceal the first duplicate ACK as the delayed cumulative
    ACK becomes combined with the first duplicate ACK when the first
    out-of-order segment arrives at the receiver (in case of an enlarged
    ACK ratio such as with ACK congestion control [FARI08], even more
    significant portion is affected).  Second, segment duplication or
    out-of-window segments increase the risk of falsely triggering loss
    recovery as they trigger duplicate ACKs.

    ADDME: window updates can be used to determine current state when
    other ACKs where lost, they would not even be dupacks (Thanks to
    corridor talk with Anna Brunstrom).

    The algorithm specified in this document uses TCP Selective
    Acknowledgement Option [RFC2018] to determine duplicate ACKs and to
    trigger loss recovery based on the information gathered on the SACK
    scoreboard [RFC3517]. It works in the pre-recovery state giving a
    more accurate heurestic for determining the number of out-of-order
    segments arrived at the TCP receiver.  The information gathered on
    the scoreboard reveals missing ACKs and allows detecting duplicate
    events. Therefore, the algorithm enables a timely triggering of Fast
    Retransmit. In addition, it allows the use of Limited Transmit
    regardless of lost ACKs and also in the cases where the SACK
    information is piggybacked to a cumulative ACK due to delayed ACKs.
    This, in turn, allows keeping ACK clock running more accurately.

    This algorithm is close to what Linux TCP implementation has used
    for a very long time. A similar approach is briefly mentioned along
    ACK congestion control [FARI08] but as the usefulness of the
    algorithm in this document is more general and not limited to ACK
    congestion control we specify it separately. We also note that the
    defination of a duplicate acknowledgement already suggests that an
    incoming ACK can be considered as a duplicate ACK if it "contains
    previously unknown SACK information" [RFC2581bis]. While
    similarities with this algorithm and Forward Acknowledgement (FACK)
    [MM96] exist, they differ in how the quantity of data outstanding in
    the network is determined.

1.2.  Definitions

    The reader is expected to be familiar with the definitions given in
    [RFC2581bis], [RFC2018], and [RFC3517].



2.  Algorithm Details

    In order to use this algorithm, a TCP sender MUST have TCP Selective
    Acknowledgement Option [RFC2018] enabled and negotiated for the TCP
    connection. A TCP sender MUST maintain SACK information in an
    approproate data structure such as scoreboard defined in [RFC3517].
    This algorithm uses functions IsLost (SeqNum), Update(), and SetPipe
    () and variables DupThresh, HighData, HighRxt, Pipe, and
    RecoveryPoint, as defined in [RFC3517].

    A TCP sender using this algorithm MUST take following steps:

    1)  Upon the receipt of any ACK containing SACK information:

        If no previous loss event has occurred on the connection OR
        RecoveryPoint is less than SND.UNA (the oldest unacknowledged
        sequence number [RFC793]), continue with the other steps of this
        algorithm. Otherwise, continue the ongoing loss recovery.

    2)  Update the scoreboard via the Update () function as outlined in
        [RFC3517].

    3)  Only if SACK blocks contained previously unknown in-window SACK
        information, count the acknowledgment as duplicate ACK
        [RFC2581bis].  TODO: clarify how to behave on cumulative ACKs
        and with non-dupacks.

    4)  Determinate if a loss recovery should be initiated:

        If IsLost(SND.UNA) returns false AND the sender has received
        less than DupThresh duplicate ACKs, goto step 5A. Otherwise goto
        step 5B.

    5A) Invoke optional Limited Transmit:

        Set HighRxt to SND.UNA and run SetPipe(). The TCP sender MAY
        transmit previously unsent data segments according the
        guidelines of Limited Transmit [RFC3042], with the exception
        that the amount of octets that can be send is determined by Pipe
        and cwnd.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: February 2010              August 2009


        If cwnd - pipe >= 1 SMSS, the TCP sender can transmit one or
        more segments as follows:

        Send Loop:

        a) If available unsent data exists and the receiver's advertised
           window allows, transmit one segment of up to SMSS octets of
           previously unsent data starting with sequence number
           HighData+1 and update HighData to reflect the transmission of
           the data segment. Otherwise, exit Send Loop.

        b) Run SetPipe() to re-calculate the number of outstanding
           octets in the network. If cwnd - pipe >= 1 SMSS, go to step
           a) of Send Loop.  Otherwise, exit Send Loop.

    5B) Invoke Fast Retransmit and enter loss recovery:

        Initiate a loss recovery phase, per the fast retransmit
        algorithm outlined in [RFC2581] and continue with a fast
        recovery algorithm, such as the SACK-based loss recovery
        algorithm outlined in [RFC3517].


3.  Discussion

    In scenarios where no ACK losses nor reordering occur and the first
    acknowledgement with SACK information is not the ACK held due to
    delayed acknowledgements mechanism, the new SACK information with
    each duplicate ACK covers a single segment. In such a case, this
    algorithm will trigger loss recovery after three duplicate
    acknowledgements and will allow transmission of a single new segment
    using Limited Transmit on each acknowledgement.  This is identical
    to the behavior that would occur without this algorithm (assuming
    DupThresh is 3 and that all segments are SMSS sized). This scenario
    together with other scenarios describing the behavior of the
    algorithm are depicted in Appendix A.

    A set of potential issues to consider with the algorithm are
    discussed in the following.


3.1.  Small Segment Sender

    If a TCP sender is sending small segments (usually intentionally
    overriding Nagle algorithm [RFC896]), the IsLost(SND.UNA) used in
    step 4 of the algorithm might fail to detect the need for loss
    recovery on the third duplicate acknowledgement because not enough
    octets have been SACKed to cover DupThresh * SMSS bytes above



Jarvinen/Kojo                                     Section 3.1.  [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: February 2010              August 2009


    SND.UNA. If the SACKed octets are discontiguous (the second rule of
    IsLost()), the loss recovery is still triggered on time. Otherwise,
    the traditional duplicate ACKs algorithm needs to be used as a
    fallback. Step 3 and the latter condition of step 4 implement the
    traditional algorithm paraller to the SACK block based detection,
    however, it comes with a cost of lost robustness against ACK losses
    as expected.

    Alternatively, a TCP sender that is able to discern segment
    boundaries accurately can consider full segments in IsLost()
    regardless of segment size.  Therefore, such a TCP sender can avoid
    the problem with small segments using IsLost(SND.UNA) check alone
    which means that step 3 and the latter condition of step 4 are
    redundant and do not have to be implemented.

    Note: the small segments problem is not unique to this algorithm but
    also the SACK-based loss recovery [RFC3517] encounters it because of
    how IsLost() is defined.


3.2.  One Segment is Small

    A variant of small segment sender case is the case where only one of
    the SACKed segments is smaller than SMSS (possible even with Nagle
    enabled).  If TCP sender lacks ability to use the improved method by
    discerning segment boundaries but still wants robustness against ACK
    losses in this case, it MAY replace IsLost(SND.UNA) with test:

        SACKed octets > SMSS * (DupThresh - 1)


3.3.  SACK Capability Misbehavior

    If the receiver represents such a SACK misbehavior that it
    advertizes SACK capability but never sends any SACK blocks when it
    should, this algorithm fails to enter loss recovery and
    retransmission timeout is required for recovery. However, such
    misbehavior does not allow SACK-based loss recovery [RFC3517] to
    work either, and a TCP sender will anyway require a timeout to
    recover.


3.4.  Compatibility with Duplicate ACK based Loss Recovery Algorithms

    This algorithm SHOULD NOT be used together with a fast recovery
    algorithm that determines the segments that have left the network
    based on the number of arriving duplicate acknowledgements (e.g.,
    NewReno [RFC3782]), instead of the actual segments reported by SACK.



Jarvinen/Kojo                                     Section 3.4.  [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT           Expires: February 2010              August 2009


    In presence of ACK reordering such an algorithm will count the
    delayed duplicate acknowledgements during the fast recovery
    algorithm as extra while detemining the number of packets that have
    left the network.

    In general there should be very little reason to combine this
    algorithm with a loss recovery algorithm that is based on inferior,
    non-SACK based information only.


4.  Security Considerations

    A malicious TCP receiver may send false SACK information for
    sequence number ranges which it has not received in order to trigger
    Fast Retransmit sooner. Such behavior would only be useful when out-
    of-order segments have arrived because otherwise the flow undergoes
    a loss recovery with a window reduction. This kind of lying involves
    guessing which segments will arrive later. In case the guess was
    wrong, the performance of the flow is ruined because the TCP sender
    will need a retransmission timeout as it will not retransmit the
    segments until it assumes SACK reneging. On a successful guess the
    attacker is able to trigger the recovery slightly earlier. The later
    segments would have allowed reporting the very same regions with
    SACK anyway. Therefore, the gain from this attack is small, hardly
    justifiable considering the drastic effect of a misguess. Also, a
    similar attack can be made with the duplicate acknowledgment based
    algorithm (even if the new SACK information rule is applied) by
    sending false duplicate acknowledgements with false SACK ranges, and
    trivially without the new SACK information rule.

    A variation of the lying attack discards reliability of the flow but
    as soon as the reliability is not a concern of the receiver, a
    number of simpler ways exist to attack TCP independently of this
    algorithm. Thus this algorithm is not considered to weaken TCP
    security properties against false information.

    PLACEHOLDER: SACK splitting to make recovery to start sooner than it
    should or to trigger more segments (with less bandwidth in the
    opposite direction than using multiple duplicate ACKs).

Appendix


A.  Scenarios


A.1.  Basic Case

    In this scenario no Delayed ACK, ACK losses, reordering or other
    "abnormal" behavior happens. For simplicity all the segments are
    SMSS sized.

    Once the TCP receiver gets first out-of-order segment, it sends a
    duplicate ACK with SACK information about the received octets. The
    following two out-of-order segments trigger a duplicate ACK each,
    with the corresponding range SACKed in addition to the previously
    know information. The sender gets those duplicate ACKs in-order,
    each of them will SACK a new previously unknown segment.

    This algorithm triggers loss recovery on third duplicate ACK because
    IsLost returns true as DupThresh * SMSS bytes became SACKed above
    the SND.UNA on the same acknowledgement, thus the behavior is
    identical to that of a sender which is using duplicate
    acknowledgments.  If Limited Transmit is in use, two first duplicate
    ACKs allow a single segment to be sent with either of the algorithms
    (Pipe is decremented by SMSS by the SACKed octets per ACK allowing
    SMSS worth of new octets).

A.2.  Delayed ACK

    A basic case with delayed ACK send the first ACK with SACK
    information but since the previous ACK was sent with a lower
    sequence number because an acknowledgment is held by delayed ACK,
    the sender will not considered it as duplicate ACK. Because the
    segment contains SACK information that is identical to the basic
    case, the sender can use Limited Transmit with the same segments as
    in the basic case and will start loss recovery at the third
    acknowledgment, i.e., with the second duplicate acknowledgment. In
    the same situation the duplicate ACK based sender will have to wait
    for one more duplicate ACK to arrive to do the same as the first
    acknowledgment is fully "wasted".

    Technically an acknowledgement with a sequence number higher than
    what was previously acknowledged is not a duplicate acknowledgement
    but a presence of the SACK block tells another story revealing the
    receiver which used delayed ACK, and thus the missing duplicate
    acknowledgement in between. The response of a TCP sender taking
    advantage of such inferred duplicate acknowledgements is well within

A.3.  ACK Losses

    This case with ACK loss shares much behavior with the case with
    delayed ACK. If hole at rcv.nxt is filled, the sender will notice
    that cumulative ACK advanced.  In case of out-of-order segments the
    first ACK which gets through to the sender includes SACK blocks up
    to the quantity the SACK block redundancy is able to cover.  With
    this algorithm the sender immediately takes use of all the
    information that is made available by the incoming ACK.

A.4.  ACK Reordering

    With ACK reordering an ACK is postponed.  Due to redundancy the next
    ACK after postponed one contains not only its own information but
    also the information of the reordered ACK (similar to the ACK losses
    case). Then when the reordered ACK arrives, the sender already knows
    about the information it provides and therefore no actions are taken
    with this algorithm.

        4000, SACK=4500-6500


A.5.  Packet Duplication

    Packet duplication happens either due to unnecessary retransmission
    or hardware duplication.  It adds a redundant ACK which has only
    redundant information or a data segment to the stream which will
    triggers a redundant duplicate ACK (possibly with SACK and/or DSACK
    [RFC2883] information).  Because neither adds any new SACKed octets
    at the sender, this algorithm will not do anything while duplicate
    ACK based receiver would falsely consider it as a duplicate ACK.

    If one of the redundant ACKs is lost, the effect of duplication is
    just negated.

    It is possible for the sender to detect this case using DSACK alone.


A.6.  Mitigation of Blind Throughput Reduction Attack

    In case an attacker knows or is able to guess 4-tuple of a TCP
    connection, it may apply a blind throughput reduction attack.  In
    this attack TCP is tricked to send duplicate ACK to the other
    endpoint using out-of-window segments which it is considerably
    easier to achieve than a match with sequence numbers. If more than
    dupThresh duplicate ACKs can be triggered in row without any

    legimate segment that advances acknowledged sequence number, the
    other end acts according that false congestion signal and halves the
    window.

    With this algorithm such duplicate ACKs are filtered because they do
    not have any new in-window SACK blocks (DSACK [RFC2883] might be
    present though).

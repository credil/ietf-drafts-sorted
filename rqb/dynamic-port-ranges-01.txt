Internet-Draft             Dynamic Port Ranges              October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The IETF starts discussing a scheme for enlarging the usable IP
   address space in [I-D.ymbk-aplusp] or [I-D.boucadair-port-range]
   using parts of the port numbers, similar to what Network Address
   Translators (NAT) do.  This allows to assign the same IP address to
   several customers or hosts.  The IP address together with the port
   bits extension differentiate the routing and forwarding of that
   communication.

   So far within the IETF DHCP extensions [I-D.boucadair-dhc-port-range]
   and PPP extensions [I-D.boucadair-pppext-portrange-option] to assign
   IP addresses and port ranges to hosts and sites have been proposed.
   However, since the deployments are very different for different
   users, customers with several users etc., more means for managing
   port assignments appear to be required.  Measurements showed that
   different clients need different range sizes at different times
   [flow-counting].

   This implies that dynamic port range assignment seems to be needed
   for

   o  assigning clients larger port ranges when the current one becomes
      too small,

   o  assigning clients smaller port ranges, when the current ones are
      underused,

   o  changing clients port ranges for reducing fragmentation of the
      port space,

   o  balancing port consumption for a shared IPv4 address.

   The existing means are sufficient to assign and re-assign port ranges
   (both contiguous and non-contiguous ones).  However, a client cannot
   immediately switch from one port range to another one, because most
   applications cannot change port numbers while using them.  Without
   interrupting existing connections, a client can only start allocating
   new ports in a new range and wait until ports in an old range are not
   used anymore.  Consequently, a client needs to wait until
   applications have closed all ports in the old port range.  Existing
   means allow to assign more than one port ranges to a client
   ([I-D.boucadair-port-range]), but not to identify one or more ranges
   that should not be used anymore by the client.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Dynamic port range re-assignments

   This draft proposal provides a way for a port range assignment server
   to tag a port range with an attribute that signals the client not to
   allocate any more ports in this range.  Such a signal can be sent
   when a server signals more than one port range to a client.  A most
   simple implementation would be adding a flag to one or more port
   ranges during the (re-)assignment process that marks these ranges as
   not to be used anymore.  A client receiving the signal would then
   stop allocating port numbers in the marked ranges.  When the client
   does not use an address range anymore, it signals back that the port
   range is not in use anymore and can be re-assigned.  This can be done
   individually for each range as soon as it is not used anymore or at
   once when all marked ranges are not used anymore.

   The method can also be used for reducing (trimming) already assigned
   port ranges.  For this purpose, the server divides the single port
   range into two or more consecutive port ranges and re-assigns the
   single port range as a set of port ranges to the client with one or
   more of the port ranges marked as not to be used anymore.  Again, the
   client would signal back that one or more ranges are not used
   anymore.

   This new technique allows to postpone the de-allocation of port
   ranges until the respective ports are closed (lazy de-allocation).
   The client has the possibility to actively confirm the release of
   port ranges.


4.  Usage scenario

   The following usage scenario describes the impact of the proposed
   method from the initialization phase till final de-allocation of port
   ranges.

   A broadband operator manages IP address and port range manager for
   broadband access provisioning at a BRAS (Broadband Remote Access
   Server).  The client would be a home router, a single host or the
   gateway of a large enterprise, allocating port numbers when acting as
   NAT for the respective devices.

Internet-Draft             Dynamic Port Ranges              October 2009


4.1.  Initialization

   When a client requests an IPv4 address with a port range including
   the number of ports, the BRAS assigns it and signals the assigned
   port range to the client.  The port range specified by the client
   could be a preferred port range indicated by a minimum value and a
   maximum value or just the number of ports.

4.2.  Detecting the change point

   While the client is using the port range, several reasons may occur
   that make it desirable to change the port assignment.

   o  The client may observe that there are only few unused numbers left
      in the used range and that it may soon happen that no further
      ports would be available for requesting applications.  In order to
      avoid this situation, the client requests an assignment of more
      port numbers at the BRAS.

   o  A user can actively close all ports in anticipation of an
      exceeding demand of ports from new applications to be started.
      All ports are released voluntarily in expectation of goodwill to
      get a larger port range assigned.

   o  The BRAS may monitor usage of port numbers by the clients and
      detect that there are only a few unused port numbers left in the
      range assigned to the client.  It decides to assign a wider range
      to the client before port numbers run out.

   o  The BRAS may detect that the client is only using a small part of
      the port range assigned to him and decide to assign the client a
      smaller port range.

   o  The BRAS may identify a need to re-assign the port range of the
      client in order to reduce fragmentation of the port space.

   Therefore, the port range change request could be both client and
   server initiated.

4.3.  Assigning a new port range

   The BRAS sends a message to the client.  The message contains two
   port ranges, the originally assigned one with a mark not to use it
   anymore and a new range to be used from now on.

   Optionally, it can also give a time until when the old port range is
   still valid, before it will definitely expire.

Internet-Draft             Dynamic Port Ranges              October 2009


4.4.  Ongoing port consumption

   The client only allocates new port numbers of the new range.

4.5.  Final de-allocation of a port range

   Either the BRAS detects that no port number of the initial port range
   is in use anymore (through monitoring) and signals to the client that
   the initially assigned range is not anymore assigned to the client.

   Or the client send an explicit signal that it is not using the
   initial range anymore and the BRAS can assign it to other clients.

   Alternatively, the client can carry out a partial release of a
   requested port range, hence splitting the port range in used and
   unused ports.


5.  Location of the address and port manager

   In the above usage scenario, it is implied that the IP address and
   the port range management service is supplied with a BRAS.
   Alternatively, the IP address and port range manager can be located
   at a MSAN (Multi Service Access Node), DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line
   Access Multiplexer), or any other infrastructure equipment.

5.1.  Mobile networks

   The scheme might also apply to mobile networks, where the server is
   located on the SGSN (Serving GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
   Support Node) or GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node), and the client on
   a user equipment.


6.  Signaling

   The signaling between client and server can be done through different
   protocols including DHCP extensions, PPP extensions, Web Services,
   TR-069, or a novel protocol for address and port pool management.


7.  Fragmentation

   According to [I-D.boucadair-pppext-portrange-option] and
   [I-D.boucadair-dhc-port-range], it is possible to assign more than
   one port range to a customer (using a port mask and a port locator).
   It is expected that contiguous port range allocation will be the
   preferred procedure.  However, together with the introduced technique



Ripke, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             Dynamic Port Ranges              October 2009


   to enlarge or to reduce individual port ranges the port range manager
   might have to deal with heavily fragmented port mapping tables.
   Besides administration overhead this may lead to problems if new
   contiguous port ranges are requested.  Dynamic port range re-
   assignment provides a technique that can both amplify and rectify
   this problem.


8.  Port Range Swapping

   Port randomization [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-port-randomization] is a mechanism
   to make it harder for "blind" attacks to spoof a system.  However,
   having a smaller port range to choose from produces more port
   collisions.  Local collisions can be easily detected by comparing a
   port against open connections.  Remote collisions on the other hand
   are harder to detect unless recently closed connections are tracked
   like suggested in [I-D.ananth-tsvwg-timewait].  The problem is that
   an active closer of a TCP connection lingers in state TIME-WAIT for
   four minutes for the respective connection's five-tuple (local
   address, local port, remote address, remote port, protocol).
   Frequent connections to the same server might induce a situation
   where the client's ports are in said state on the server and no more
   connections are possible for a while.  Clearly, the smaller the
   client's port range the more often this undesired effect may occur.
   One solution with dynamic port range management might be the
   possibility to exchange a used port range for a recently unused port
   range with the port range manager.


9.  Service Management

   As already mentioned in [I-D.levis-behave-ipv4-shortage-framework], a
   management station assigns the number of ports to the customer upon
   pre-configured policies which might depend on the individual contract
   with the customer or on the customer's usage profile.

9.1.  Server policy

   The process on the BRAS for deciding on how many ports to give away
   is based on policies configured into the BRAS from a management
   station.  That might depend on the customer status.  Premium
   customers paying a certain fee might request higher numbers.  It can
   also depend on the current level of free addresses and ports.  When
   there are only a few ports left the IP address and port range manager
   might be more restrictive with port allocations.  In general, the
   mechanisms described above in the usage scenario requires
   configuration on the BRAS to behave in one or the other way, also
   including the configuration of the client.

Internet-Draft             Dynamic Port Ranges              October 2009


9.2.  Client policy

   The policies will also be configured into the client.  Those policies
   tell the client how large of a space he/she is allowed to request,
   and at what usage level the client should ask for more port space.
   For example, that can be if only 80% of the ports are used, the
   client asks already for more, or the client only asks for more if he
   fully used up his space.


10.  Open issues

   Dynamic port range re-assignment has several open issues to be solved
   or clarified:

   o  Modifications are required to both the DHCP and the PPP protocol
      in addition to the extensions described in
      [I-D.boucadair-dhc-port-range] and
      [I-D.boucadair-pppext-portrange-option] respectively.

   o  What strategy should be chosen to solve a potential port mapping
      table fragmentation?

   o  The constant port monitoring which the port range manager has to
      carry out might impose problems.

   o  How to handle expiration timers when requesting port ranges to be
      cleared?

   o  The processing of port overflow caused by exceeding port number
      requests might become a delicate problem.  If available port
      numbers for a specific IPv4 address do not match a client's
      request it would be necessary to assign a new IPv4 address.

   Eventually, the price to be paid for dynamic port range management is
   complexity.

Abstract

   This document proposes a new Dynamic Delegation Discovery System
   (DDDS) Application to map E.164 numbers to metadata.

   It discusses the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) for resolving
   E.164 numbers into metadata to provide information about E.164
   numbers in cases where E.164 Number to URI Mapping (ENUM) can not be
   used.

Internet-Draft       E.164 to Metadata (E2M) Mapping            Oct 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   E.164 Number to URI Mapping (ENUM) [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] provides
   an identifier mapping mechanism to map E.164 numbers [ITU.E164.2005]
   to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986] using the Domain
   Name System (DNS) [RFC1034].

   Thus, ENUM can be used look up the services associated with an E.164
   number.  However, it is controversial whether or not the result of an
   ENUM lookup should always result in a communications session using
   the URI found in the corresponding Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR)
   [RFC3403] DNS Resource Record (RR).

1.2.  Problem Statement

   Several proposals for Enumservice registrations do not fulfill the
   above mentioned interpretation, which suggests that an ENUM lookup
   should always result in a communications session.  These proposals
   are therefore virtually locked in the process.  Such proposals
   include (but are not limited to) Enumservices for 'cnam'
   [I-D.ietf-enum-cnam] to provide information about the calling party
   name, and 'unused' [I-D.ietf-enum-unused] to provide a hint that a
   number is not in use.

   Another issue is that the result of a ENUM (E2U) lookup always needs
   to be an URI, which makes otherwise simple mappings rather complex.

   The authors of such Enumservice proposals tried to circumvent the
   issues by introducing data URI scheme or inventing completely new URI
   schemes, with limited success however.  The main objection that an
   ENUM lookup should always result in a communications session
   remained.

1.3.  Proposal

   This document proposes a new Dynamic Delegation Discovery System
   (DDDS) [RFC3401] application E2M, which can be used with DNS NAPTR RR
   for resolving E.164 numbers into metadata.  The resulting metadata
   can be used for (for example) to provide hints about properties of
   certain ENUM domains or to provide information that can be used as
   attribute of an E.164 number.

   This proposal intends to allow a means for services related to E.164
   numbers that do not fit into the concept of ENUM (E2U), and to
   provide a way forward for such existing proposals in the queue.

Internet-Draft       E.164 to Metadata (E2M) Mapping            Oct 2009


   As there are lots of similarities between E2M and ENUM (E2U), this
   document generally only outlines the differences to ENUM (E2U)
   instead of repeating all parts shared between the two.  Therefore a
   firm understanding of ENUM [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] and Enumservices
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] and is required.

1.4.  Discussion

   This is work in progress at early stage.  The members of the ENUM and
   DNS related Working Groups as well as other interested parties are
   invited to contribute to the discussion arising from this proposal.
   Until E2M has a proper home this discussion will take place on the
   ENUM WG discussion list <enum@ietf.org>.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  DDDS Application for E2M

   If not specified differently herein, the rules described in
   [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] for ENUM apply also for E2M. So far the
   following parts have been identified to be different from ENUM:

3.1.  Expected Output

   Section '2.3.  Expected Output' of [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] is
   replaced as follows:

   The output of the last DDDS loop can be one of the following:

   o  An ASCII Text string

      The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] for the ASCII
      string is to be specified in the corresponding E2M registration
      (see also Section 4.1.1).

      Note: Depending on the E2M service specification (see Section 4)
      the Expected Output might be always empty.

   o  A URI in its absolute form according to the 'absoluteURI'
      production in the Collected ABNF found in [RFC3986].

Internet-Draft       E.164 to Metadata (E2M) Mapping            Oct 2009


3.2.  Flags

   Section '2.4.3.  Flags' of [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] is replaced as
   follows:

   This Database contains a field that contains flags that signal when
   the DDDS algorithm has finished.  At this time the following flags
   are defined:

   o  "t": This means that this Rule is the last one and that the output
      of the Rule is an ASCII Text string.

   o  "u": This means that this Rule is the last one and that the output
      of the Rule is a URI [RFC3986].

   See also [RFC3404].

   If a client encounters a record with an unknown flag, it MUST ignore
   it and move to the next Rule.  This test takes precedence over any
   ordering since flags can control the interpretation placed on fields.

   A novel flag might change the interpretation of the regexp and/or
   replacement fields such that it is impossible to determine if a
   record matched a given target.

   If this flag is not present then this rule is non-terminal.  If a
   Rule is non-terminal then clients MUST use the Key produced by this
   Rewrite Rule as the new Key in the DDDS loop (i.e., causing the
   client to query for new NAPTR records at the domain name that is the
   result of this Rule).

3.3.  Services Parameters

   Section '2.4.4.  Services Parameters of [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] is
   replaced as follows:

   Service Parameters for this Application take the following form and
   are found in the Service field of the NAPTR record that holds a
   terminal rule.  Where the NAPTR holds a non-terminal Rule, the
   Services field SHOULD be empty, and clients SHOULD ignore its
   content:

      service-field = "E2M" 1*(servicespec)
      servicespec = "+" e2m-service
      e2mservice = type 0*(subtypespec)
      subtypespec = ":" subtype

Internet-Draft       E.164 to Metadata (E2M) Mapping            Oct 2009


      type = 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
      subtype = 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")

   In other words, a non-optional "E2M" (used to denote E164 to Metadata
   only Rewrite Rules in order to mitigate record collisions) followed
   by one or more E2M services which indicate the class of functionality
   a given end point offers.  Each E2M service is indicated by an
   initial '+' character.

   Note: As [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] is work in progress, certain
   adjustments to this section are still to be expected.


4.  Registration of E2M Services

   For the registration of E2M services, if not specified differently
   herein, the rules described in [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] for
   Enumservices also apply for E2M services.  So far the following parts
   have been identified to be different from the Enumservices:

4.1.  Required Sections and Information

   Compared to Section '5.  Required Sections and Information' in
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] the <class> element is omitted,
   and a new element for <abnf> is added.  Depending on the Flag either
   the <urischeme> (flag "u") or the <abnf> for the ASCII Text
   replacement (flag "t") MUST be specified.

4.1.1.  Augmented Backus-Naur Form (<abnf>)

   The ABNF [RFC5234] to limit the ASCII Text string the E2M service
   resolves.  The 'Substitution Expression Syntax' is specified in
   Section 3.2 [RFC3402]).  Any parts of ABNF further specified in an
   E2M service specification override those parts of ABNF specified in
   Section 3.2 [RFC3402]).  However, the resulting ABNF MUST be a subset
   of the ABNF specified in Section 3.2 [RFC3402]).

   Typically only the 'repl' part of the ABNF needs to be further
   specified.  However, in rare cases (depending on the application)
   also a limitation of the 'delim-char' part may be justified (see also
   4th example below).

   The E2M registration MAY be specified to be always empty (see also
   2nd example below) or it MAY specify an encoding mechanism to allow
   for localized strings.

   e.g.   <abnf>
            repl = foobar / 1*8( DIGIT )
          </abnf>
          <abnf>
            foobar = ( "foo" / "bar" / "foobar" )
          </abnf>


   e.g.   <abnf>
            repl = ""
          </abnf>


   e.g.   <abnf>
            repl = ( "active" / "passive" / "undefined" )
          </abnf>


   e.g.   <abnf>
            repl = anychar <!-- Note: 'anychar' defined in RFC 3402 -->
          </abnf>
          <abnf>
            delim-char   = "/"
          </abnf>




5.  Examples

   The following examples illustrate the usage of the E2M service:


   $ORIGIN 0.6.9.4.5.1.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
      NAPTR 10 100 "t" "E2M+unused" "" .
      NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2M+unused:http" \
          "!^.*$!http://www.nra.example/sabc.htm?SABC=1154!" .
      NAPTR 10 100 "t" "E2M+cnam" \
          "!^.*$!charset=us-ascii;Donald%20Duck!" .



6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Registry Creation

   IANA will create a Registry "E2M Service Registrations" as defined in
   (this) Section 6.

   It is noted that the process described herein applies only to
   ordinary E2M service registrations (i.e. the registration process of
   "X-" E2M services is beyond the scope of this document).

Internet-Draft       E.164 to Metadata (E2M) Mapping            Oct 2009


6.3.  Location

   Approved Enumservice registrations are published in the IANA Registry
   named "E2M Service Registrations", which is available at the
   following URI:
   < http://www.iana.org/assignments/e2m-services >.

   This Registry publishes representations derived from the IANA
   Registration Template as described in Section 6.2 and specified in
   Section 4.1 above.

   Where the E2M service Specification is NOT an RFC, IANA MUST hold an
   escrow copy of that Enumservice Specification.  Said escrow copy will
   act as the master reference for that Enumservice Registration.

6.4.  Further Considerations

   Section 11.4 - 11.8 in [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] for
   Enumservice Registrations also apply for E2M Services.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations outlined in [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] and
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] for ENUM apply also to E2M
   services.  Apart from those there are no specific security issues to
   be considered for this document.

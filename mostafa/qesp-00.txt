Abstract

   This document describes a new IPSec protocol called QoS-friendly 
   Encapsulating Security Payload (Q-ESP).  Q-ESP provides 
   confidentiality, data origin authentication, anti-reply, 
   connection less integrity, and facilitates QoS active admission 
   control. The currently implemented IPSec Encapsulating Security 
   Payload (ESP) protocol is not QoS friendly as it encrypts the upper 
   layer transmission protocol and prevents network control devices 
   such as routers and switches from utilizing this information in 
   performing classification appropriately. In this document we provide 
   the specification of Q-ESP which gives the same security services 
   provided by ESP, in addition to strong source and destination 
   addresses authentication and its ability to facilitate QoS 
   classification.

1. Introduction
    
   The Internet has become essential for information exchange. Various 
   activities are carried out via the Internet: between companies (B2B),
   among businesses and consumers (B2C), or between individuals who 
   create their own virtual communities (e.g., P2P). This clearly causes
   a huge demand for the network bandwidth. Moreover, many real-time 
   applications such as video conferencing and Voice over Internet 
   Protocol (VoIP) have been developed. These types of traffic-demanding 
   applications suffer greatly from congestion and delay. Thus, there is 
   a great need to find methods and mechanisms to manipulate traffic more 
   efficiently according to their needs. Quality of service (QoS) has 
   emerged to deal with this kind of problem. Basically, it refers to the 
   nature of packet delivery service provided, as described by parameters 
   such as bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss [Shenker and
   Wroclawski, 1997]. The way of classifying traffic and providing QoS 
   levels defines different QoS architectures [Nguyen, 2003]. Mainly, we 
   distinguish two standard QoS architectures: Integrated service [Braden, 
   Clark and Shenker, 1994] and Differentiated service [Blake, Black, 
   Carlson, Davies, Wang and Weiss, 1998].

   Actually, in the QoS field, the "Class of Service"concept divides the 
   network traffic into different classes and provides a class-dependent 
   service to each packet (depending on which class it belongs to). 
   To classify packets, each packet is assigned a priority value. The 
   latter is stored in the "Type of Service" (ToS)[Postel, 1981] field 
   in the IPv4 header (also called "Traffic Class" in IPv6) [Deering and 
   Hinden, 1998]. In the differentiated service architecture, this priority 
   value is called Differentiated service code point (DSCP) [Nichols, Blake, 
   Baker and Black, 1998].However, it is obvious that allowing the sending 
   device to classify traffic or to set traffic priorities may be subject 
   to threats, as the sender may classify his traffic in a way that gives 
   him upper priorities. This is clearly the disadvantage of what is 
   called passive admission control. Conversely, service providers perform 
   active admission control by allowing edge routers (neither users nor the 
   sending devices) to inspect the incoming traffic and classify it.
   Note that in both architectures (the differentiated service and 
   integrated service), the packet classifier component inspects incoming 
   packets and classifies them. As the classifier inspects multiple fields 
   in the packet, it is called Multi-Field (MF) classifier [Borg, Savanberg 
   and Schelen, 1999].

   Actually, the fields needed to be inspected belong to different network 
   layer headers [Gupta, 2000]:

	_Transport Layer Protocol Header: the MF packet classifier inspects
   two fields of the transport layer protocol (TCP/UDP) header, the source 
   and destination port numbers; these fields naturally help to identify 
   the applications running over TCP/UDP.

	_Network Layer Protocol Header: three fields are inspected at this 
   layer, the source host IP address that helps to identify the sending 
   host, the destination host IP address, which helps to identify the 
   end-system receiving the data, and the protocol identifier that is used 
   to identify the transport-layer protocol in use.

   The previously mentioned five fields are used to define the traffic flow 
   [Huston, 2000]. However, even if these fields are required for QoS 
   processing, some of them are unfortunately hidden (encrypted) when 
   using security protocols such as IPSec [Kent and Atkinson, 1998] ESP 
   [Kent, 2005].
  
   To solve this problem, we propose a new security protocol the 
   "QoS-friendly Encapsulated Security Payload (Q-ESP)". Not only Q-ESP 
   provides stronger security protection but also supports QoS active 
   admission control.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [Bradner, 1997].

3  Q-ESP: QoS-friendly Encapsulating Security Payload

3.1. QoS friendly Encapsulating Security Payload(Q-ESP) packet format

   The major aim of the Q-ESP protocol is to construct packets that are QoS 
   controllable according to active admission control.

   In addition to security services provided by the IPSec ESP (i.e. Data 
   origin authentication, Anti-reply integrity, connectionless integrity and 
   confidentiality), Q-ESP supports QoS by providing the necessary and 
   sufficient information for the controlling devices to enable them 
   performing active admission control.

   Besides that, Q-ESP prevents replay attacks. In fact, while the anti-reply
   function is optional in ESP and AH [Kent and Atkinson, 1998], it is 
   mandatory in Q-ESP. In addition, while authentication is optional in ESP, 
   it is mandatory in Q-ESP as it prevents against attacks that form malicious
   packet from valid IP and ESP headers but with invalid payload (which will 
   be discarded later after doing the most resource intensive process of 
   decryption). Moreover, Q-ESP authentication provides data origin 
   authentication (as it covers the source and destination addresses fields 
   of the outer IP-header).

   Figure 1 depicts the structures of Q-ESP in IP versions 4 and 6. 
   An Q-ESP packet contains eight additional octets. Like ESP, the structure 
   of Q-ESP is composed of the header, the payload, the trailer, and the 
   authentication data area. All the fields of the Q-ESP packet are described 
   below.

			Figure 1: Q-ESP packet format


3.1.1 The Q-ESP header

   The Q-ESP header contains a Security Parameters Index and a Sequence Number.

   In addition, to cope with QoS requirements, we copy the first two fields 
   (source and destination ports) of the upper layer transfer protocols and 
   place them in clear (without encryption) in the Q-ESP header. Also, the 
   value of the transport layer protocol is recorded in the TLP field; This 
   clearly allows MF packet classifier to perform efficient packet 
   classification. In this respect, the Q-ESP header includes the following 
   six fields:

3.1.1.1   Source Port

   This is a 16-bit fixed-length field; it contains the first field of the 
   upper layer transport protocol (TCP/UDP) source port number; this field is 
   needed to be in clear to enable network edge routers to check traffic and 
   set priorities. 

3.1.1.2   Destination Port

   This is also a 16-bit fixed-length field; it contains the second field of 
   the upper layer transport protocol (TCP/UDP) destination Port number; as 
   the source port, this field is also needed to be in clear to enable network
   edge routers to check traffics and set priorities. 

3.1.1.3 Transmission Layer Protocol (TLP)

   This is an 8-bit fixed-length field that indicates the protocol of the 
   transport layer.

Mostafa, et al.			Expires 06/10			   [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT              draft-mostafa-qesp-00.txt		      12/09   

   The previously mentioned three fields (Source Port, Destination Port and 
   TLP) are used with IP source and destination addresses to identify traffic 
   flow.


3.1.1.4   Reserved

   This is a 24-bit fixed-length field that is not used (reserved for future 
   uses) and must be set to zero.

3.1.1.5   Security Parameters Index

   This is an arbitrary 32-bit fixed length identifier that in combination with 
   the destination address and security protocol (Q-ESP) uniquely identifies the
   security association (SA) in use.

3.1.1.6   Sequence Number 

   This is an unsigned 32 bit field. It is a monotonically increasing ID that is
   used to detect replay attacks. This value is authenticated, so that malicious
   or accidental modifications could be detected. 

3.1.2 The Q-ESP payload

   The payload encrypts the upper layer transport protocol and its payload data 
   in transport mode, while in tunnel mode it encrypts the entire original IP 
   packet including its header. 

3.1.3 The Q-ESP trailer 

   The Q-ESP trailer includes the Padding, the pad length field and the Next 
   Header field.

3.1.3.1 Padding

   This is provided to allow block-oriented encryption algorithms area for 
   multiples of their block size. 

3.1.3.2 Pad length

   This is an 8-bit fixed-length field that indicates the length of the 
   included pad. 

3.1.3.3 Next Header

   This is a mandatory, 8-bit fixed-length field that points backward to refer 
   to the type of the protocol (IP, TCP, UDP, etc.) in the encrypted payload. 

3.1.4. Authentication data area

   It is a variable length area that is used to store the Integrity check
   value (ICV). The Integrity Check Value (ICV) is calculated over the
   Q-ESP headers and the Payload. In Q-ESP, to inherit the capability of AH, 
   we also apply the authentication algorithm over the source IP address 
   and destination IP address fields of the IP header. 
   However, unlike AH, we think that authenticating the rest of the IP header 
   fields is meaningless as they will be used before the packet reaches the
   IPSec layer (i.e. before verifying their integrity); therefore, any change
   in their values will not affect the IPSec processing.  
   Besides, in Q-ESP, both authentication and encryption are mandatory.
   Actually,authentication helps to prevent DoS attacks [Nikov, 2006]. 
   Moreover,implementing authentication with encryption provides in 
   depth-defense if the encryption secret key is corrupted; in fact even 
   if the attacker succeeds in reading the content of the payload, 
   he will not be able to alter its content.

			Figure 3: Q-ESP in tunnel mode 


   In both the transport and the tunnel mode, the Protocol field of the  outer 
   IP header should have a new value indicating that the next protocol is Q-ESP. 
   Thus, we should assign a new protocol identifier to Q-ESP protocol. 


3.3 Q-ESP Processing

   The same processing steps performed for ESP are performed for Q-ESP, however 
   there are some differences. In this draft, we only mention these differences.
 
3.3.1. Outbound processing

   In the outbound processing, the differences between Q-ESP and ESP processing
   are concerned with Q-ESP header construction and Integrity Check Value (ICV)
   Calculation.

INTERNET-DRAFT               draft-mostafa-qesp-00.txt		      12/09 

3.3.1.1: Constructing the Q-ESP header

   To construct Q-ESP header, we will copy the first two fields (source and 
   destination ports) of the upper layer header protocol (TCP/UDP) at the 
   beginning of Q-ESP header. Then, we will put the protocol number of the 
   upper layer transmission protocol in the TLP field. Next we set the value 
   of the reserved field to zero. After that, we place the security parameter
   index (SPI) obtained from the SA in its field (to tell the receiver how to 
   react with this packet); and finally, we increment the sequence number and 
   place it at the last field of the header. In this respect, the Q-ESP header 
   will contain the following fields: source port number, destination port
   number, TLP, reserved, security parameter index (SPI) and sequence number.

3.3.1.2: Computing the authentication value

   Recall that Q-ESP must authenticate the source and the destination IP 
   addresses, to achieve this goal:
   We use the standard authentication algorithm (specified by the SA) such as 
   SHA-1 and its associated key to compute the integrity check value according
   to equation 1. Then, we store the computed ICV value in the Q-ESP 
   authentication data area. 

         ICV = H(MH || P || Src IP || Dst IP, KA)    (1)

   Where, ICV is the integrity check value, H is the keyed-authentication 
   algorithm, MH is the Q-ESP header, P is the Q-ESP encrypted payload, and 
   the  "Src IP" and "Dst IP" are the the source IP address and the destination
   IP address fields of the external IP header respectively, KA is the 
   authentication key, and || is the concatenation symbol. 

3.3.2. Inbound processing

   In the inbound processing, the differences between Q-ESP and ESP processing
   exist in sequence number checking and Integrity Check Value (ICV) 
   calculation.

3.3.2.1: Checking sequence number 

   In Q-ESP, this step is mandatory to prevent replay attacks. If the sequence
   number of the packet is valid (i.e., it is not a duplicate and is not to
   the right of the sequence number window contained in the SA), proceed to 
   the next step, otherwise the packet is dropped.

   It is important to note that the window must not be advanced until the
   packet that would cause its advancement has been authenticated. Otherwise,
   an attacker can generate bogus packets with large sequence numbers that
   would move the window outside the range of valid sequence numbers and
   causes valid packets dropping [Dowaswamy and Harkins, 2003].

3.3.2.2: Verifying the authentication value

   Again, the difference here is in the authentication coverage; use the
   standard authentication algorithm specified by the SA such as SHA-1 and
   its associated key to re-compute the integrity check value (ICV)(using
   equation 1) for the Q-EPS header and its payload, the protocol identifier,
   the source IP address, and the destination IP address fields of the external
   IP header. Then, the result is compared with the value stored in the
   Authentication data area; if they are equal, proceed to the next step, if
   not, drop the packet.

INTERNET-DRAFT               draft-mostafa-qesp-00.txt		      12/09 
   
   Actually, we have modified the IPSec kernel implementation of NetBSD version
   5 to implement Q-ESP protocol [Mostafa, Abou El Kalam and Fraboul, 2008; 
   2009; 2010]. We tested our implementation and compared its performance with
   ESP protocol. We built two different testbeds and used different scenarios.
   The test results show that, in best effort environment both ESP and Q-ESP
   have almost the same throughput for the same packet size; While in QoS
   managed environment, Q-ESP has the advantage of allowing network control
   devices to perform QoS classification adequately.

4. QoS classification batch

   In order to deploy Q-ESP protocol, a slight software batch is needed to
   be implemented and installed in the currently used network control devices
   (such as routes) that perform QoS classification. The goal of this batch
   is to tell classification algorithm where to find the needed fields to
   perform classification. Actually, the position of these fields differs from
   normal IP packet to Q-ESP protected packet. While the positions of IP source
   and destination addresses are not changed, the position of source and
   destination port numbers are moved to the beginning of the Q-ESP header.
   In addition, the transport layer transfer protocol identifier is placed in
   the TLP field in the Q-ESP header.

5. Possible applications of Q-ESP

   Generally speaking, Q-ESP can be used, instead of  ESP, in all applications
   that need both security and QoS such as VoIP, VoD, satellite data, etc.
   Moreover, Q-ESP can be used on top of MPLS to guarantee the confidentiality
   of client data (as regards ISPs) while ensuring the other security and QoS
   services.

   Basically, Q-ESP has the added benefits of facilitating QoS classification,
   allowing active admission control and separating security administrative
   tasks from QoS administrative tasks.
   Now, we could control the security of our data and let internet service
   providers (ISPs) mange only QoS aspects. A Q-ESP packet can be handled
   within different types of QoS domains. It can enter an integrated service
   domain and exit it to enter another differentiated service or MPLS domain.
   The needed information to perform classification is available and the
   security of the packet is guaranteed. Clearly, the priority value of the
   packet could be changed from domain to another depending on the QoS policy
   defined in each domain.

   Current solutions must classify packets and set each packet' priority before
   encrypting it with ESP. Using Q-ESP, we encrypt our packets first before
   sending it to ISPs QoS managed domains; in this way, the packets could be
   easily classified and handled in all domains without any fear regarding its
   security.

   Security --->  service  ----->  service   ----->  MPLS  -----> Security
   Gateway	   domain 	    domain    	    domain	  Gateway


   In addition, if a packet filtering firewall is installed before the VPN
   module (which is common architecture), the packet filtering firewall could
   easily manipulate the packet as the needed fields to perform filtering
   policy is available. In this way we could minimize the possibility of DoS
   attack to the VPN module, as unconcerned packets will be filtered by the
   firewall.

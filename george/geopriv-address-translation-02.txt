   [Open Issue : re-frame this draft as more about the inclusion of a

Internet-Draft        Location translation protocol         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The growth of location-based services and increased access to real
   time sensor feeds, the ability to access and exchange real-
   time,dynamic geolocation information becomes more important.  This
   draft describes how to convert civic addresses as defined in
   [RFC5139] to geodetic coordinates and vice versa.

   An example of a simple Civic Address is 'Washington, DC'.  Using a
   Gazetteer service to geocode the address, a geodetic coordinate of
   (40.8N, 73.9W) might be returned.  Conversely, entering (40.8N,
   73.9W) into a reverse geocoding service might return 'Washington DC'.

   It is sending PIDF-LO (civic) to the server and getting a geodetic
   address back.  To use it, look up your location's co-ordinates, and
   then enter them in the request.  The corresponding response will
   return the civic address of the requested coordinates.  In the same
   way the geodetic address obtained, if civic address information has
   provided in the request.

   The Geodetic-civic address translation SHOULD return standard errors
   and status codes.  The possible errors conditions are listed in the
   Section 5.


2.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Coordinate System Translation

3.1.  Reverse Geocoding: Geodetic-Civic Translation

   This method performs the conversion of a latitude/longitude pair into
   human-readable addresses.  A reverse geocoder service is a network-
   accessible service that transforms a given position (geodetic
   coordinate) into a normalized description of a feature location
   (Address with Point), where the address may be defined as a street
   address, intersection address, place name or postal code.  A reverse
   geocoding service could be a service supported in a location server.

   The client or server sends a request to the location server/reverse
   geocoding service containing the position expressed as geodetic
   coordinates.  If the address was successfully located, it sent back
   to the requester.  The response is a civic address for the given

   geodetic address, and the response encoding (format) is described in
   RFC [RFC5139].  In case of ambiguous addresses, only the point for
   the best match is passed in the response.

3.1.1.  Reverse Geocoder Service Requirements

   The following requirements must be supported by the Reverse Geocoder
   Service.

   Given a Position ADT, must be able to return one or more locations
   (i.e., Address ADTs with associated Point geometries), and
   optionally, the ranges of these locations from the given position, as
   it is defined in the Position ADT.

   The form of the returned address(es) must be based upon the user's
   preference, as stated in the request.  The user should be able to
   specify a preference of StreetAddress, StreetIntersection, or
   PositionOfInterest (Place and/or PostalCode).  If not specified, the
   service should default to StreetAddress.

   Must be capable of returning all location information of a preferred
   type within an area of interest (AOI ADT - a Circle, Polygon or Box).

   Must be able to indicate the number of matches in the response
   (possibly zero) for a given request.

   The given response is the result for a civic address request, where
   the geodetic address is -34.407 150.88001.

   The civic address includes the header fields that are defined in
   [RFC5139].  We recommend that if a national or regional standard (and

Internet-Draft        Location translation protocol         October 2009


   schema) exists for encoding addresses, such as the US national
   address coding standard, that this schema be supported in the
   response.  See also
   draft-ietf-geopriv-civic-address-recommendations-03.

   One thing that needs explanation is accuracy, which is a measure of
   how accurately the system is returning location information.  It
   allows to specify whether it is 'exact', 'neighborhood' etc.
   However, it is worth specifying how much deviation from the requested
   location in terms of meters.  If client sends a request with geodetic
   address and there is no mapping found in the server, server could
   return civic address which is close by.  Also specify how much
   deviation from the requested location in terms of meters.

3.2.  Geocoding: Civic-Geodetic Translation

   A geocoding service is a network-accessible service that transforms a
   description of a location, such as a place name, street address or
   postal code, into a normalized description of the location with a
   Point geometry (geodetic coordinate).  A geocoding service could be a
   service supported in a location server to parse the given civic
   address and get response back.

   The server will attempt to find the closest addressable location
   within a certain tolerance; if no match is found, the server will
   usually return a status code, unknown addresses.




3.2.1.  Geocoder Service Requirements

   The following requirements must be supported by the Geocoder Service.

   Given a Civic Address, must be capable of using an address matching
   Geocoding algorithm to determine a position (geodetic coordinate) for
   the specified address.

   Must be capable of performing geocoding using an incomplete address
   and return the complete set of address information (i.e., a
   normalized address).

   Must be able to indicate the number of matches in the response
   (possibly zero) for a particular address supplied in the geocoding
   request.

   Must be capable of processing one or more addresses in a single
   geocoding request.

   May provide information on the quality of the result using a match
   code.

   May return the centroid of a zip code if an address is not complete.

   May return an altitude if the service supports this capability.

   Hence, the corresponding response from the server.

   Result for a civic address request contains each individual response.
   More than one result may be returned if the given address is
   ambiguous.  Possible values, from most specific to most general are:
   address, street, zip, city, state, country etc. <warning>: If the
   exact address was not found, the closest available match will be
   noted here.


4.  The Accuracy

   Location translation service returns an Accuracy value within each
   returned address.  This value indicates the resolution of the given
   result, but not necessarily the correctness of the result.  For
   example, a civic address of "111 8th Avenue, New York, NY" may return
   8 (Address) level accuracy, indicating that the given address is on
   the order of resolution of a street address.  A civic address for

   "France" would only return 1 (Country) level accuracy.

   The following table lists the accuracy values returned by the Geo-
   Civic address translation service.  Note that these accuracy values
   only indicate the expected resolution.

   Value Description

   0 Unknown accuracy.

   1 Country level accuracy.

   2 Region (state, province, prefecture, etc.) level accuracy.

   3 Sub-region (county, municipality, etc.) level accuracy.

   4 Town (city, village) level accuracy.

   5 Post code (zip code) level accuracy.

   6 Street level accuracy.

   7 Intersection level accuracy.

   8 Address level accuracy.

   9 Premise (building name, property name, shopping center, etc.) level
   accuracy.

   Consider an example for <locationResponse> with accuracy information.

   expected.  This document should re-use the HELD error codes.  In
   particular, the server should always return a 200/OK, possibly with a
   HELD <error> element.  In addition to HELD errors codes, following is
   a list of error codes that you may encounter.

   accessDenied: You do not have permission to access this resource.

   internaleError: An internal problem prevents from returning data.

   notDefined: The address translation process failed due to an error
   not covered by the definition of any other error code in this
   interface.

   For each error, you'll receive an XML response of the following form.


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

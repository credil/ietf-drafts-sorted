Internet-Draft                LWIP Gateway                    March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The ultimately goal of enabling IP stack on small devices is to
   connect them to the global Internet.  Many efforts are dedicated to
   compressing IPv6 header for smart devices [RFC4944]
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc] so that the smart objects network is IPv6
   ready.  However the connection from the gateway to the outside
   network is still evolving to the IPv6; many parts of the network is
   still IPv4, especially for home users.  And many Internet application
   servers are not IPv6 ready.  The IPv6 smart device could not connect
   to the IPv4 service platform without intermediate boxes.

   In this situation, it is important to discuss how to connect the IPv6
   ready smart objects network to the non IPv6 ready global Internet.
   This document introduces several identified problems and some
   considerations on solutions to these problems.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Network Architecture and Scenarios

   Figure 1 depicts the secenario of the interconnection between the
   smart objects network and the Internet.  Several important components
   within this architecture is analyzed below:

   1.  Node: the smart device.  In current IETF efforts, the Node is
       IPv6 ready and IPv6 only.  Numbers of the Nodes constitute the
       smart objects network, which is IPv6 ready.
   2.  SNG: Smart Network Gateway.  The SNG interfaces with the smart
       objects network and the operators's access network.  The SNG
       should support the wireless technolgies connecting with the Node
       and the lightweight IPv6 implementation as well.  The upper
       connection from the SNG to the access network depends on the
       capability provided by the operator.
   3.  ONG: Operator Network Gateway.  The ONG may not be visible to
       users.  It is used to apply charging, security and QoS policies.
       In certain scenarios, the ONG is used to manage an IPv6-in-IPv4
       tunnel between the SNG and itself.
   4.  Server: the applicatoin server.  The server may be IPv4 or IPv6,
       or dual-stack.  It collects information from the smart network
       and share/push these information to users Internet wide.

3.  Solution Considerations

   When both the access network and the application servers are IPv6
   enabled, the solution to this problem is trivial as far as we can
   see.  The communication between the Node and the Server is end-to-
   end.

   When the server is not IPv6 ready or part of the network is not IPv6
   ready, several solutions need discussion at the current point.  This
   section discusses several considerations on the solutions.

3.1.  Aggregated Smart Network Gateways

   In this sense, the connection between the Node and Server is not end
   to end.  Rather, the SNG aggregates the information collected from
   the smart devices and sends the aggregated message to the service
   platform.  As long as the SNG is enabled with Server the same IP
   family, the rest of the work is trivial.

   Most existing applications follow this non end-to-end architecture.
   But in this architecture, the SNG should be implemented with service
   logical and its scalability is challenged.

3.2.  Tunneling IPv6

   When the server is IPv6 ready but part of the network is not IPv6
   ready, tunneling the IPv6 within the IPv4 packets is a direct
   solution.

   For example as shown in Figure 2, the access network is IPv4 only and
   the Internet and Server is dual stack.  The SNG and ONG should
   establish an IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel.  The SNG encapsulates the IPv6
   packets within the IPv4 header to the ONG and ONG de-capsulates the
   IPv6 packet and sends to the service platform.  Softwire tunnels

3.3.  IP Family Translation

   If the service platform is IPv4 only, the need of IPv6 to IPv4
   translation is indispensable.

   In Figure 3, the SNG does not translate the IPv6 directly.  Rather,
   SNG tunnels the IPv6 packets to the ONG within the IPv4, and the ONG
   decapsulates and translates the IPv6 to IPv4, using stateless or
   stateful translation [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].

      |---IPv6-----|====================|----------------------|

                       Figure 3: Translation on ONG

   In Figure 4, different from the above scenario, the SNG translates
   the IPv6 to IPv4 directly, using stateless or stateful translation

1.  Introduction

   Default Address Selection algorithms defined in RFC3484 [RFC3484]
   specify default behavior for all IPv6 implementations.  By default,
   IPv6 is preferred over IPv4 for dual stack host.  Some specific
   scenarios in IP family selection have not been considered in RFC3484.
   This document attempts to summarize the problems regarding IP family
   selection.

2.  Problem Summary

2.1.  Problem 1: NAT64 or NAT44?

   If a dual stack host is configured with a DNS64 server [DNS64] and
   communicates with an IPv4 only server, the synthesized AAAA record
   will be preferred over the A record.  So the dual stack host will
   choose IPv6 to communicate with IPv4 and packets will go through the
   NAT64 translator instead of NAT44.

   Draft [DNS64-Config] identifies this problem and introduces serveral
   solutions to this problem.

2.2.  Problem #2: NAT464 or NAT46?

   On a BIS/BIA enabled host, if the server is IPv4 only, the Extension
   Name Resolver will return a type A record to the application and
   normally IP traffic will go through the NAT64 gateway as in
   PNAT[I-D.huang-behave-pnat].

   If the server is upgraded to dual stack, the ENR on the host will get
   both an A and an AAAA record.  According to RFC3484 [RFC3484], the
   host will prefer communicating using the IPv6 address and translation
   will be conducted in NAT46.  But problems arises for those
   applications that need ALG.  There may need ALG for those
   applications on the host.  If no ALG functions are available on the
   host, the communication will fail.  So in this case, the BIA/BIS
   enabled host is desired to retain communicating. via NAT464.

2.3.  Problem #3: Self-assigned or Shared Addresses

   RFC3484 should consider the effect of non-meaningful IPv4 address (in
   PNAT [I-D.huang-behave-pnat]) and IANA assigned shared IPv4 address
   in DS-Lite [I.D-GI-DSL], and define cope for these addresses.

   For example, the dual stack host has been assigned an IPv4 address
   (public or private), and has been assigned an IPv6 prefix and self-
   assigned IPv4 address, When the DNS returns an A record, the dual
   stack host should have a specific way to choose which IPv4 address is
   preferred.  Suppose only an AAAA record is returned, on a BIA/BIS
   enabled host with only IPv4 application, the DNS resolver will return
   the mapped IPv4 address to the application.  The source address
   selection algorithm is left to select an appropriate source address
   for communication.  In this case, if the network assigned IPv4
   address is selected, communication may fail.

1.  Introduction

   The LOWPAN_HC1 algorithm in [RFC4944] defines the common compressed
   header encoding for IPv6 packets.  The "Next Header" encoding bits,
   i.e., bit 5 and 6 in Figure 1, denotes the way the following header
   type is either UDP, ICMP or TCP.  And the HC2 encoding bit (bit 7)
   denotes if there is more header compression bits followed.


     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

         Figure 1: LOWPAN_HC1 (common compressed header encoding)

   The LOWPAN_IPHC algorithm in [I-D.6LOWPAN-IPHC] also defines the
   general compression header for next header following the IPv6 header.
   Now the encoding format for the IPv6 extension headers and UDP header
   compression are defined, but the TCP header compression format is not
   defined yet in both LOWPAN_HC1 and LOWPAN_IPHC algorithm.  However,
   Zigbee Smart Energy Profile 2.0 [Zigbee-SE] requires that all devices
   shall support TCP on its transport layer.  To support the
   applications based on TCP, it is important to specify a TCP
   compression header for the low-power devices.  This document is
   dedicated to this task.

2.  Encoding of TCP Header

   Bits 5 and 6 of the LOWPAN_HC1 allows compressing the Next Header
   field in the IPv6 header (for UDP, TCP, and ICMP).  This section
   explains how the TCP header itself may be compressed.  The HC2
   encoding in this section is the HC_TCP encoding, and it only applies
   if bits 5 and 6 in HC1 are both set to "1" indicating that the
   protocol following the IPv6 header is TCP.  The HC_TCP encoding is
   defined in Figure 2

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

                 Figure 2: TCP Compression Header Encoding

   The HC_TCP encoding for TCP is shown as below (starting with bit-0
   and ending at bit-7).

      TCP Source Port (bit 0)

       0:  TCP source port is not compressed, but carried in-line.

       1:  TCP source port is compressed to 4 bits.  The actual 16-bit
         source port is obtained by calculating: P + short_port value.
         The value of P is the number 61616 (0xF0B0).  The short_port is
         expressed as a 4-bit value which is carried "in-line"

      TCP Destination Port (bit 1)

       0:  TCP destination port is not compressed, but carried in-line.

       1:  TCP destination port is compressed to 4 bits.  The actual 16-
         bit destination port is obtained by calculating: P+short_port
         value.  The value of P is the number 61616 (0xF0B0).  The
         short_port is expressed as a 4-bit value which is carried "in-
         line"

      TCP Sequence Number (bit 2)

       0:  TCP Sequence Number is not compressed, and the full length
         32-bit Seq.No is carried in-line.

       1:  TCP Sequence Number is compressed to 4 bits, and the short
         sequence number is carried in-line.

      TCP ACK Sequence Number (bit 3)

       0:  TCP ACK Sequence Number is not compressed, and the full
         length 32-bit sequence is carried in-line.

       1:  TCP ACK Sequence Number is compressed to 4 bits, and the
         short sequence number is carried in-line.

      TCP Header Length(bit 4)

       0:  TCP Header Length is not compressed, and the full length
         4-bit header length value is carried in-line.

       1:  TCP Header length is omitted, and actually the stack do not
         need to know the exact length of the header.

      TCP Window Size (bit 5)

       0:  TCP window size is not compressed, and the full length 16-bit
         window size is carried in-line.

       1:  TCP window size is compressed to 4-bit, and the short window
         size is carried in-line.

3.  An Example

   If the HC_TCP encoding equals to "11111111", the TCP header will be
   compressed into 8 bytes as in Figure 3

1.  Introduction

   Default Address Selection algorithms defined in RFC3484 specify
   default behavior for all IPv6 implementations.  RFC3484 implicitly
   assumes that the IP address is fully in accordence with the
   applications.  Specificly, if the host chooses an IPv6 address, it
   assumes that there will be IPv6 applications on it.  But this
   assumptions may be invalid during the IPv6 migration.  For example,
   the host is only assigned an IPv6 prefix and it generates a fake IPv4
   address to use its IPv4 application.  In this case, if the server is
   IPv4 only, applications invoking gethostbyname() will return only a A
   record, and the source address selection algorithm will prefer the
   IPv4 address because they are the same IP family.  If there is no
   host translation module such as BIA [I-D.huang-bia-bis] BIS
   [I-D.huang-bis-bis] or PNAT [I-D.huang-behave-pnat] on the host, this
   default behavior will result into the communication failure.

   This document attempts to summarize the problems that are not
   addressed by current default address selection algorithms.

2.  Problem Summary

2.1.  Amendment #1

   A simple workaround way to this problem is introduced in this
   section.  We suggest the DNS64 should handle A request normally.  So
   dual stack host will be able to receive both A and AAAA response from
   DNS64, and then destination address selection policy will take effect
   and host will select IPv4 address for communication.

   |   APPS    |  Address  |  Network  |  Service  | Default behavior  |
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------------+
   |    v4     |   v4v6    |    v6     |    v4     |       failure     |

                       Figure 1: IP Family Selection

2.2.  Amendment #2

   RFC3484 should consider the effect of non-meaningful IPv4 address (in
   PNAT [I-D.huang-behave-pnat]) and IANA assigned shared IPv4 address
   in GI-DS-Lite [I.D-GI-DSL].

1.  Introduction

   This document discusses several requirements for always online mobile
   applications which reveals that PCP only solution does not fill the
   gap.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Scenario and Problems

   Figure 1 depicts the secenario of the mobile network environment.  BS
   is the radio Base Station which provides wireless connectivity to the
   MN.  The MNG/FW is the MN's default router which provides IP address
   management and NAT/Firewall functionality.  The Border Router (BR) as
   the name implies, borders the Internet for the mobile network.  The
   BR does not perform subscriber management for the mobile network.
   The mobile application server is server on the Internet that provides
   application layer service to the MN.

   To make the mobile application behave like always online, there are
   several states that need to be kept.  Below, we take Instant Message
   applications as an example,

   1.  Mobile App Server: the server needs to know if the mobile client
       is still active and if the mobile node is still on-line.  Mobile
       application developers always make the mobile client send keep
       alive messages at an interval.
   2.  NAT state: The GW/FW needs to keep the NAT binding state for the
       TCP/UDP mappings.  Once the NAT states staled, the mobile
       application server is not able to push messages to the mobile
       client.
   3.  IP address state: the mobile network normally uses the so called
       "packet data protocol (PDP)" to manage the IP connection with the
       MN.
   4.  Wireless Channel State: when packets are ready, the mobile node
       needs to acquire the wireless channel in order to receive or
       transmit those packet.

3.  Requirements for Always-online Mobile Applications

   The requirements that need to be addressed by an always-online mobile
   applications.

3.1.  R1: Support for NAT and Firewall State Keep-alive

   Mapping states on the NAT box or Firewall should be retained in order
   to make the MN visible and reachable from outside.  PCP
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] is an instant solution this problem, however it
   does not take into account the other problems as list below.

3.2.  R2: Keep the State on Mobile App Server

   The mobile application server needs to keep track of the mobile node
   in order to know the status of the mobile application.  For example,
   mobile Instant Message servers need to know the MN's presence status
   and notify their friends accordingly.

   Note: most mobile applications send keep alive messages between the
   MN and the server in order to keep the state on both the App Server
   and the NAT/FW.

3.3.  R3: Keep the State on Mobile Network Gateway

   The IP connection between the MN and Mobile Network Gateway (MNG) is
   managed by a certain Packet Data Protocol (PDP) in the mobile
   network.  The MNG frequently releases the resources and state of IP
   connection after a setup timeout.  In order to make the mobile
   applications always online, the state on the MNG should be

   maintained.

3.4.  R4: Relieve Burden on Air Interface

   In order to maintain any states mentioned above, it necessarily send
   many small packets between the MN and MNG or MN and the APP Server
   which incurs a huge burden on the air interface.  Whenever
   transmitting packets, one dedicated channel is required.  When the
   channel is released, the paging procedure is triggered.  Both of
   these incur a lot of signalling on the air interface.  It is highly
   indispensable to relieve the burden on air interface.


4.  Security Considerations

   TBD.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.

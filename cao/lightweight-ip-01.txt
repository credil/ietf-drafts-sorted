Abstract

   This document describes the requirements for a new lightweight IP
   stack for the Low-power and Lossy Networks, such as wireless sensor

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the requirements for a new lightweight IP
   stack for the Low-power and Lossy Networks, such as wireless sensor
   networks, 802.15.4 enabled networks, and Machine-to-Machine type
   communication (M2M).

   Multiple implementations of IP stack exist for the Internet of
   Things.  There is a need of standardizing these efforts to increase
   interoperations among them.

2.  Characteristics of LLN

2.1.  Latency

   The latency of M2M link is high mostly due to the low data rate.

2.2.  Low Power

   Typically, some or all devices are battery operated.

2.3.  Data Rates

   The data rate for 802.15.4-2006 is 20-250 Kbps.  The data rate
   required for 802.15.4g is 40-1000 Kbps.

2.4.  Small Packets

   Applications within LoWPANs are expected to originate small packets.
   Adding all layers for IP connectivity should still allow transmission
   in one frame without incurring excessive fragmentation and
   reassembly.  Furthermore, protocols must be designed or chosen so
   that the individual "control/protocol packets" fit within a single
   802.15.4 frame.  Along these lines, IPv6's requirement of sub-IP
   reassembly may pose challenges for low-end LoWPAN devices that do not
   have enough RAM or storage for a 1280-octet packet.

2.5.  Asymmetry Link

   Due to the power constrain, some node may only be able to receive
   packets but not able to send packets.  This results into asymmetry
   links in the network.

2.6.  Packet Loss

   Packet loss is high due to the unstable of LLN.

Abstract

   This document describes addressing models of NAT444.  There are some
   addressing models of NAT444.  The addressing models have some issues
   of network behaviors, operations, and addressing.  This document
   helps network architects to use NAT444 after IPv4 address exhaustion.

Internet-Draft          NAT444 addressing models              March 2010


1.  Introduction

   NAT444 [I-D.shirasaki-nat444] is one of solutions after IPv4 address
   exhaustion.  ISP can select some addressing models of NAT444.  The
   addressing models have some issues of network behaviors, operations,
   and addressing.  This document describes these issues and solutions.
   It boosts up to deploy the IPv6 Internet.


2.  Addressing Models

   The key of addressing model is the address block between Customer
   Premises Equipment (CPE) and Large Scale NAT (LSN)
   [I-D.nishitani-cgn].  It's mentioned in this section.  The best
   addressing model is "ISP Shared Address" which is defined in
   [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr] and briefly described in this
   section.

2.1.  Global Address

   ISP cannot assign IPv4 Global Address any more after the exhaustion.

2.2.  Private Address

   It has two major problems.

2.2.1.  Policy Based Routing Issue

   If both source and destination address of the packet are inside LSN,
   it has to go through LSN.  The reason is that some servers reject
   receiving packets when the source address of receiving packet is
   Private Address.  Therefore packets have to go through the LSN for
   rewriting the source address from Private Address to Global Address.
   Additionally, if Private Address and Global Address co-exist inside
   LSN, the ISP has to use Policy Based Routing (PBR).

2.2.2.  Address Block Duplication Issue

   The Private Address in ISP's network could conflict with its
   customer's network address.  Many CPEs between customer's network and
   ISP's network cannot route the packet under this situation.  To avoid
   this, ISP has to negotiate with its all customers not to use the
   reserved Private Address block.

2.2.3.  Class-E Address (240/4)

   It is known that some equipment such as routers and servers reject
   packets from or to this address block.  So, to use this address block

Internet-Draft          NAT444 addressing models              March 2010


   in ISP's network, ISP has to request its customers to replace their
   equipment.  In addition to that, ISP might have to replace their
   equipment when it doesn't handle Class-E address packets properly.

2.2.4.  ISP Shared Address

   ISP Shared Address is the newly defined IPv4 address block that is to
   be allocated from IANA free pool.  It doesn't have any problem.
   Spending some blocks from the exhausting IANA free pool could be
   regarded as a problem, but from long view, this problem is much
   smaller than its great merit.  ISP Shared Address is defined in
   [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr].


3.  Example Architectures

   This section explains example architectures how to design NAT444 with
   ISP Shared Address.

3.1.  Direct Routing inside LSN

   This architecture enables direct communication between customers
   inside same LSN.  It has the following advantages.

   o  The packets don't go through LSN.  (No hairpining)

   o  The customers inside LSN can use bidirectional applications (e.g.
      TV Conference, VPN).

   o  No need to use Policy Based Routing.

         |IPv4 Host|            |IPv4 Host|

3.2.  LSN Bypassing

   This architecture is bypassing the NAT function of LSN.  It has the
   following advantage.

   o  The customers inside an ISP can use bidirectional applications
      (e.g.  TV Conference, VPN).

   o  Any communication in single ISP doesn't consume LSN external port.

   o  ISP's servers outside LSN can access CPE. (e.g.  ICMP echo, SNMP,
      remote access)

   o  ISP's servers outside LSN can distinguish which customer's
      connection it receives. (e.g.  DNS, Mail)

3.3.  Global Address Customers inside LSN

   This architecture enables co-existing Global Address and ISP Shared
   Address inside LSN.

   It enables direct communications from ISP Shared Address customer to
   Global Address customer inside same LSN.  It has the following
   advantage.

   o  The ISP can put ISP Shared Address customer and Global Address
      customer in the same concentrator.

   o  The customers inside LSN can use bidirectional applications (e.g.
      TV Conference, VPN).

   o  No need to use Policy Based Routing.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to allocate a certain size of address block from IANA free
   pool.  The size of it is described in [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr]


6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.

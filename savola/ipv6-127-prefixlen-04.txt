In some cases, the operational decision may be to use IPv6 /127
prefix lengths, especially on point-to-point links between routers.
Under certain situations, this may lead to one router claiming both
addresses due to subnet-router anycast being implemented.  This
document discusses the issue and offers a couple of solutions to the
problem; nevertheless, /127 should be avoided between two routers.

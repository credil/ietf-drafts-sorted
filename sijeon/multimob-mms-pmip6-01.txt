Internet-Draft    Mobile Multicasting Support in PMIPv6     October 2009


Abstract

   To support IP-based group communication such as mobile IPTV in mobile
   environment, IP multicasting is required. For minimized burden and
   modification on PMIPv6 components, multicasting architecture is
   required to determine where to locate the multicast router (MR) and
   how to operate IGMP/MLD action in PMIPv6 network. To deploy PMIPv6
   multicasting, there are two possible approaches: tunnel forwarding
   and direct routing scenario. But, this draft focuses direct routing
   scenario based PMIPv6 multicasting architecture that do not require
   MR function within the LMA and handover mechanism and describes
   IGMP/MLD operation. Our solution is easy to deploy and save bandwidth
   usage. And it solves the tunnel convergence problem without PMIPv6
   modification.

Internet-Draft    Mobile Multicasting Support in PMIPv6     October 2009


1. Introduction

   High performance of wireless technologies make multimedia streaming
   services possible, such as IPTV audio/video stream. These services
   are based on group communication, and IP multicasting is also
   required. Traditional IP multicast mechanisms, including multicast
   routing and membership management protocols, have been designed for
   static hosts [RFC2710][RFC3810]. Moreover, up to now, IP mobility
   protocol for mobile multicasting has depended on host-based Mobile IP
   variants (Mobile IP and Fast Mobile IPv6). However, the protocols
   require modifications to an applied solution on mobile device, as
   well as IP reconfiguration during handoff. The Proxy Mobile IPv6
   (PMIPv6) in [RFC5213] does not require any mobility-related protocol,
   and IP reconfiguration in the same PMIPv6 domain.

   However, [RFC5213] is only targeting unicasting-based mobility
   management architecture and operation. To support PMIPv6 multicasting
   service, we need the solution to determine which PMIPv6 component
   should be operated as multicast router (MR). As a first step, if a
   MAG has an MR function, a LMA needs to have MR function. Then, the
   routing update overhead degrades the performance of PMIPv6 components
   due to the frequent movement of the MNs. Second, we can consider MR
   co-located LMA model that only LMA has an MR function and a MAG has
   IGMP/MLD forwarding. It has less complexity than former case. But,
   both cases introduce the tunnel convergence problem which wastes
   bandwidth and high handover latency.

   For minimized burden of multicasting operation for PMIPv6 components
   and tunnel convergence problem, we designed PMIPv6 multicasting
   solution using direct routing which local multicast router delivers
   multicast packets to the MAG based on multicast support scenario in
   [I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement]. In our solution, a MAG is
   operated as MLD forwarding proxy function using the IGMP/MLD
   forwarding proxy [RFC4605] presented by the IETF.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

   o  Mobile Node (MN)

   o  Previous Mobile Access Gateway (P-MAG) - The MAG that manages
      mobility relaged signaling for a MN before handover. In this
      document, a MAG and Access Router (AR) are collocated

   o  New Mobile Access Gateway (N-MAG) - The MAG that manages mobility
      related signaling for the MN after handover

   o  Multicast Router (MR)

   o  MLD Forwarding Proxy (MF-Proxy)

   o  PMIPv6 Multicast Context Transfer (MCT) - It is transmitted by P-
      MAG forecasting MN's destination N-MAG. This message include MN
      ID, MN home network prefix and P-MAG IP address, and multicast
      group address of the MN executing handoff.

3. Tunnel Forwarding Scenario

   In this draft, a tunnel forwarding scenario means that only LMA has a
   MR function and a MAG has IGMP/MLD forwarding function. To transfer
   multicast data between MAG and LMA, PMIPv6 tunnel is used. However,
   this scenario introduces tunnel convergence problem because each MAG
   is connected to several LMAs. So, same tunneling packets from several
   LMAs is converged into a certain MAG.

   call it direct routing scenario that is based on local routing
   scenario described in [I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement]. This
   solution can minimize PMIPv6 modification and solve tunnel
   convergence issue caused by a MAG receives same multicast packets
   from several LMAs. To relay IGMP/MLD signaling and multicast packets,
   a MAG needs only MLD forwarding proxy function defined in [RFC4605].
   Our solution has more simple structure than tunnel forwarding
   scenario and easy to deploy because a LMA is separated from multicast
   operation.

   Directly applying a PMIPv6 handover scheme to the proposed scenario,
   it leads to service disruption due to the latency caused by the
   IGMP/MLD action [IP-MM]. To solve this problem, we utilized the

   forwarding proxy predicts an MN's movement direction and transfers
   the multicast context message, which includes the MN ID, the MN home
   network prefix, the current MAG address, and the multicast group
   address. The N-MAG then checks whether it is receiving a node of
   multicast data corresponding to the group requested by the P-MAG.  If
   this is not the case, it joins the group by sending an MLD report to
   the local MR. Then, local MR delivers the multicast packets to the N-
   MAG regardless there is a receiving node or not for designated time.
   If the MN does not arrive at the N-MAG until the timer for specific
   channel expired, the N-MAG sends a MLD report to the MR for channel
   leave. When a MAG receives the multicast packets, it simply forwards
   the packets without tunnel encapsulation.

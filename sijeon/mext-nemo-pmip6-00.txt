Internet-Draft      NEMO Support in the PMIPv6 Domain       October 2010


Abstract

   Network mobility (NEMO) enables all the nodes within a mobile network
   to provide session continuity without requiring their involvement
   when the mobile network moves. To provide NEMO support, the NEMO
   basic support protocol (NEMO-BSP) is specified in [RFC 3963].

   With the advances of the network-based mobility management protocol
   referred to as Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), interest in applicable
   NEMO support in the PMIPv6 domain is increasing however, the standard
   PMIPv6, defined in [RFC 5213], handles only a single mobile node.

   This document presents a NEMO-enabled PMIPv6 using a Proxy Router
   (PR) rather than the MR defined in [RFC 3963] and describes detailed
   operations for network/node mobility support in the PMIPv6 domain.

Internet-Draft      NEMO Support in the PMIPv6 Domain       October 2010


1. Introduction

   Network mobility (NEMO) is a novel concept for handling a group of
   nodes within a moving vehicular area. The recent rapid propagation of
   Wi-Fi handheld devices and increasing demand for Internet access
   everywhere have made NEMO technology much noticeable. To enable
   support for NEMO, the NEMO basic support protocol (NEMO-BSP) is
   specified in [RFC 3963].

   The NEMO-BSP employs the Mobile Router (MR), which connects a mobile
   network node (MNN) and access router (AR) and has the functionality
   of host-based Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC 3775] client protocol. Due to
   the host-based features, the MIPv6 has essential performance issues
   (e.g., handover latency, inefficient packet delivery, multiple
   tunneling overhead). To resolve the performance issues found in
   MIPv6, the network-based Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) has been proposed
   [RFC 5213]. The PMIPv6 provides improved performance to mobile nodes
   (MNs), but current specification handles only a single MN.

   In order to deploy the NEMO in the PMIPv6 domain, [PROB-STAT]
   presents a problem statement and applicability of NEMO-BSP. [NEMO-BS-
   PMIPv6] describes PMIPv6-NEMO scenarios and operations when MR is
   based on Mobile IPv6 protocol. [NESTED-NEMO] presents a nested NEMO
   case, and [NEMO-BSP-PMIPv6] presents several scenarios for applying
   NEMO-BSP to the PMIPv6 domain.

   We present a NEMO-enabled PMIPv6 using a Proxy Router (PR) than the
   MR defined in [RFC 3963]. Within the context of this document, the
   PR, which is located between the MNN and mobile access gateway (MAG),
   has no mobility function. It detects the MNN's movement and delivers
   corresponding information to a MAG on behalf of MNNs within its
   coverage.

   The PR and MNNs within a specified mobile network are managed with
   the same group ID by the local mobility anchor (LMA). When a PR moves
   to another MAG, the LMA then changes the binding cache entries for
   the PR and MNNs at the same time. This feature enables all the nodes
   within mobile network to provide session continuity without the MNNs'
   involvement.

   All the information in the MNNs is managed by the MAG as well as the
   LMA. As a result, when an LMA delivers packets to an MNN, no

   additional tunnel is used except for the PMIPv6 tunnel between the
   MAG and the LMA.

   The remainder of this document describes detailed operations for
   network/node mobility in the PMIPv6 domain.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

   o  Mobile Network Node (MNN) - The node that has an address
      containing the MNP, as defined in [RFC 3963].

   o  Mobile Router (MR) - It is extended from Mobile IPv6 client
      protocol and in charge of mobility management on behalf of MNN
      within a mobile network, as defined in [RFC 3963].

   o  Proxy Router (PR) - It detects the MNN's movement and delivers the
      information to the MAG behalf of MNNs within its coverage. It also
      emulates the MNN's home network on the access link.

                 Figure 1. PR Attachment to the PMIPv6 Domain

   When a PR approaches the PMIPv6 domain, this event is detected by the
   MAG. The MAG then sends a proxy binding update (PBU) message
   containing 'B' and 'N' flags set to 1 toward the LMA. The 'B' flag,
   which is derived from the bulk re-registration mechanism [BULK-REG],
   requests the allocation of a group ID (GID) and reduces the excessive
   signaling cost required to extend the binding lifetime of individual
   mobile hosts. To the 'B' flag, we add an 'N' flag, which is defined
   in this document, to denote that this node is not an ordinary mobile
   host but a proxy router. This information can be obtained from the
   security association between the MAG and the AAA.

   When an MNN approaches the PR, it sends its MNN-ID to the PR by means
   of a router solicitation (RS) message. The PR delivers the RS message
   with a 'P' flag denoting proxy, which is defined in this document,
   set to 1. After receiving the RS message, the MAG learns that the
   attached MNN belongs to the PR by examining the 'P' flag of the
   received RS message and link-layer address of the PR. To manage the
   attached node under the PR, a PBU message sent by the MAG includes
   the MNN-ID, the PR-ID of the attached PR, and a 'B' flag set to 1.
   The LMA allocates the home network prefix (HNP) for the MNN and

   groups the MNN around the group ID of the PR (PR-GID). After
   receiving the PBA message, the MAG also adds the MNN to the PR-GID.
   The allocated HNP is delivered to the PR through a router
   advertisement (RA) message with a 'P' flag set to 1. Then, the RA
   message with a 'P' flag set to 0 is finally delivered to the MNN.

   When LMA receives the packets that are destined for the MNN from a
   CN, it looks up the corresponding MAG IP address to which the MNN
   belongs in BCE. Next, the packets, combined with only the PMIPv6
   tunnel header, are sent to the MAG. When the MAG sends packets to the
   MNN via the PR, no tunnel is used because MAG knows the next hop
   address to deliver packets toward the MNN.

          Figure 3. PR's Handover operation from MAG_A to MAG_B

   When the PR moves to the next MAG (N-MAG) from the previous MAG (P-
   MAG), the P-MAG detects the PR's movement from a layer-2 event and
   then initiates a de-registration process for the PR. The N-MAG, which
   detects a PR's attachment, sends a PBU message for registration. The
   LMA receives the PBU message, finds that this node is the proxy
   router from the 'N' flag, and verifies that there exists the PR-GID
   for the corresponding PR in BCE. If the LMA has the PR-GID, it sends
   the PBA message, including the MNN-IDs and MNN-HNPs as well as PR-HNP
   and PR-GID, because the N-MAG has no information about the MNNs that
   belong to the PR.

   When an MNN moves out from a mobile network, the PR detects the MNN's
   detachment from a layer-2 signal and then sends an RS message to the
   current MAG. This RS message includes 'P' and 'D' flags set to 1 and
   MNN-ID. The 'D' flag, which is defined in this document, to announce
   MNN's movement to the MAG. When the MAG receives the RS message with
   'P' and 'D' flags set to 1, it determines that the corresponding MNN-

   ID in received RS message moved out from the PR, and it sends a PBU
   message for de-registration to the LMA defined in [RFC 5213]. The LMA
   performs de-registration and removes the MNN from the group to which
   the PR belongs; then, it sends a PBA message to the MAG. When the MAG
   receives the PBA message from the LMA, it also removes the MNN from
   the group to which the PR belongs and MNN-related entry information
   in the proxy binding update list (PBUL). When the MNN approaches the
   MAG, the MAG detects the node's movement and performs the node
   attachment procedure defined in [RFC 5213].

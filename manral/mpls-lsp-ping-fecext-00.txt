                LSP-Ping Target FEC Stack Extensions
            draft-manral-mpls-lsp-ping-fecext-00

Abstract

   LSP-Ping for MPLS is existing and widely deployment OAM mechanisms
   for MPLS LSPs.  This document describes extensions to LSP Ping Target
   FEC stack for MPLS data tunneled over MPLS tunnels, MPLS Target FEC 
   as well as Static Target FEC.

1. Introduction
   An MPLS echo request MUST have a Target FEC Stack that describes the
   FEC Stack being tested.

   The FEC defines a group of packets forwarded in the same manner. However
   the LSP Ping RFC [RFC4379] does not define FEC's for Static or MPLS.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Target FEC stack

      Sub-Type       Length            Value Field
      --------       ------            -----------
            17            5            Static IPv4 prefix
            18           17            Static IPv6 prefix
            19           4             MPLS FEC stack

2.1.  Static Labeled IPv4 Prefix

   When a Static labeled IPv4 prefix is encoded in a label stack, the 
   following format is used.  The value field consists the IPv4 prefix
   (with trailing 0 bits to make 32 bits in all), and the prefix length,
   as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                          IPv4 Prefix                          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Prefix Length |                 Must Be Zero                  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


2.2.  Static Labeled IPv6 Prefix

   When a Static labeled IPv6 prefix is encoded in a label stack, the 
   following format is used.  The value consists of 16 octets of an IPv6
   prefix followed by 1 octet of prefix length in bits; the format is 
   given below.  The IPv6 prefix is in network byte order; if the prefix
   is shorter than 128 bits, the trailing bits SHOULD be set to zero.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                          IPv6 prefix                          |
      |                          (16 octets)                          |
      |                                                               |
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Prefix Length |         Must Be Zero                          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

2.3 MPLS Target FEC

   MPLS top of the stack is what is encoded in the FEC.

3.  Security Considerations

   The draft does not introduce any new security considerations.  Those
   discussed in [RFC4379] are also applicable to this document.


4.  Acknowledgements

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New Target FEC subtype Type

   A new Channel type is defined in Section 2.1.  IANA is requested to
   assign a new value from the "PW Associated Channel Type" registry, as
   per IETF consensus policy.

   Type       Value    Meaning
   ----       -----    -------
    1          17       Static IPv4 prefix
               18       Static IPv6 prefix
               19       MPLS FEC stack

INTERNET DRAFT        Chain Grant Type for OAuth 2         March 1, 2011


1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2] provides a
   method for making authenticated HTTP requests to a resource or
   service using an OAuth token issued to third-party clients. OAuth
   tokens are issued through a number of grant types defined in the
   specification.

   OAuth supports the ability to support new grant types via definition
   of new extension grant types. This specification defines an extension
   grant type that enables "chained" authorization between separate
   OAuth infrastructures or "domains". 

   Figure 1, shows a "chained authorization" where by an OAuth protected
   resource provider (Server A) to in turn, act as an OAuth client to
   another OAuth resource provider (Server B).

   Server A (OAuth Domain A) requests an OAuth token from Server B by
   presenting its own client credential to Server B's token service
   along with the OAuth token used by the "Originating Client" to access
   Server A. In response, Server B's token service provides Server A an
   OAuth token for Server B. 

+-----------+          +------------------+         +-----------------+ 
|Originating|          | OAuth Protected  |         | OAuth Protected | 
|  Client   |--------->|     Server A     |-------->|    Server B     |
|           |          |    (Domain A)    |         |   (Domain B)    | 
+-----------+          +------------------+         +-----------------+ 
                                    
                    Figure 1: Typical Chain Scenario

   While this scenario could be solved through the use of bearer tokens
   or other similar technologies, "Chained Authorization" enables pair-
   wise trust and client credential validation when transactions are
   happening in a series of connected steps (similar in nature to a
   message bus). 

   When exchanging tokens between separate OAuth "domains", each domain
   is able to use different token types and set different client
   credential requirements for each pair-wise relationship.

   This specification uses the terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-
   v2].

   Please discuss this draft on the oauth@ietf.org mailing list.

1.1  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Unless otherwise noted, all protocol parameter names and values are
   case sensitive.


2.  Chained OAuth token Request 

   An OAuth protected service (the chain requestor), wishes to in turn
   act as a client to another OAuth protected service. In doing so, the
   chain requestor is utilizing the existing authorization relationship
   with the originating client to access another service on the
   originating client's behalf along with its own client credential.

   For the purpose of this specification, an OAuth "domain" is defined
   as a set of one or more resource servers whose authorization is
   managed by a common OAuth token server. Chained OAuth token requests
   MAY occur between OAuth domains, OR MAY occur with in a single domain
   with a common OAuth token service.

   The process by which the originating client obtains an OAuth token is
   defined by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

                  Figure 2: Chain OAuth Token Request

   The request/response flow illustrated in Figure 2 includes:

   (A)  The originating client requests a resource from the OAuth
        Protected Service (Domain A). In doing so, it presents OAuth
        token AT1 (previously issued) as per the normal OAuth resource
        access request [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

   (B)  The OAuth Protected Service & Client (the chain requestor)
        requests an OAuth token that includes the received OAuth token
        AT1 and a grant_type of "http://oauth.net/grant_type/chain".

   (C)  The target Token Server (Domain B) validates the client
        credentials of the chain requestor and the token AT1 provided
        per the processing rules defined in this specification and
        issues a new OAuth token (AT2) valid the current domain (Domain
        B).

   (D)  The chain requestor accesses the "chained" OAuth Protected
        Server in Domain B with the new OAuth token (AT2).

        Note that in a single domain scenario, the Token Server (Domain
        B) MAY  be the same token server for the OAuth Protected Server
        (Domain A).

2.1  Client Requests OAuth token

   The client (the chain requestor) makes a request to a token endpoint
   and includes the received OAuth token. The core details of which are
   defined in OAuth [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2], by specifying
   "http://oauth.net/grant_type/chain" as the absolute URI value of the
   "grant_type" parameter and by adding the following parameter:

   oauth_token
        REQUIED. The value of the oauth_token parameter MUST contain a
        single OAuth token previously issued by an OAuth server. The
        token server MAY choose to interpret scope encoded within the
        provided OAuth token.

        The format of the oauth_token value is corresponds to the value
        used in an HTTP "Authorization" header when accessing a resource
        as defined in section 7 of the OAuth specification [I-
        D.ietf.oauth-v2].

   scope
        OPTIONAL. The scope of the access request expressed as a list of
        space-delimited strings. The value is defined by the token
        server. If the value contains multiple space- delimited strings,
        their order does not matter, and each string adds an additional
        access range to the requested scope.

        Where scope is available in both the provided oauth_token and
        the scope parameter, the token endpoint MAY choose to interpret
        and prioritize scope values from either the parameter or the
        OAuth token in any way it deems appropriate to its domain.

   Token servers SHOULD issue OAuth tokens with a limited lifetime and
   require clients to refresh them by requesting a new OAuth token using
   the same originating oauth_token, if it is still valid, or with a new
   originating oauth_token. The token server SHOULD NOT issue refresh
   tokens.

2.2  Processing Requirements

   Prior to issuing an OAuth token response as described in [I-
   D.ietf.oauth-v2], the token server MUST validate the provided
   oauth_token according to the following criteria. If present, the
   token server MUST also validate the client credentials of the
   requesting client. Application of additional restrictions and policy
   are at the discretion of the token server.

   o  If the oauth_token denotes an identifier used to retrieve
      authorization information, the authorizing server MUST be able
      query the issuing server for the purpose of validation and to
      retrieve authorization information. The method for which this is
      done are beyond the scope of this specification and is defined by
      companion OAuth token specifications.

   o  If the oauth_token can be parsed and self-contains authorization
      information, then the authorizing server MUST validate the token
      and obtain necessary authorizing information. The method by which
      this is done is beyond the scope of this specification and is
      defined by companion OAuth token specifications.

   o  The token server MUST validate that received oauth_token is still
      valid either by parsing the token itself, or by confirming
      validity with the token server (which is out of the scope of this
      specification).

2.3  Error Response

   If the oauth_token is not valid, or authorization information
   requirements cannot be met, the token server MUST construct an error
   response as defined in [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2]. The value of the error
   parameter MUST be the "invalid_grant" error code. The token server
   MAY include additional information regarding the reasons the OAuth
   token was considered invalid using the error_description or error_uri
   parameters.

   Example error:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error":"invalid_grant",
     "error_description":"Audience validation failed"
   }

2.4  Example (non-normative)

   Though non-normative, the following examples illustrate what a
   conforming token request would look like. Note: Line breaks are for
   readability purposes only.

   POST /token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1
   Host: authz.example.net
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=http%3A%2F%2Foauth.net%2Fgrant_type%2Fchain
   oauth_token=MAC+token%3D%22h480djs93hd8%22

     %2Csignature%3D%22kDZvddkndxvhGRXZhvuDjEWhGeE%3D%22


3.  Security Considerations

   The specification builds on considerations described within the OAuth
   2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

   [[Other considerations TBD]]


3.1  Single Domain

   OAuth protected servers within the same domain, using the same Token
   server, MAY request new OAuth tokens for the purpose of binding the
   original user context with the new client credential.

3.2  Multi-Domain

   When issuing tokens between OAuth domains, the token server MUST be
   able to determine the submitted oauth_token's issuer.

   The token server SHOULD have a method of establishing trust with the
   issuer of the received OAuth token.

   The token server MUST define a method of mapping received credentials
   received via the received OAuth token.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The following is a parameter registration request, as defined in The
   OAuth Parameters Registry of The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-
   D.ietf.oauth-v2], for the "oauth_token" parameter:

   o  Parameter name: oauth_token

   o  Parameter usage: token request

   o  Change controller: IETF

   o  Specification document(s): draft-hunt-oauth-chain

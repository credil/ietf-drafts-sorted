Abstract

   This document specifies a framework for implementing a session policy
   channel using EAP. It defines a standard mechanism by which a mobile
   device can conduct a session policy exchange with a policy network
   component, using EAP as a lower layer protocol, to obtain session
   policies. EAP Re-authentication Protocol is suggested as a mechanism
   to allow asynchronous use of SIP at upper layers.

1. Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC 3261] is an application-
   layer control (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and
   terminating sessions with one or more participants. These sessions
   can include VoIP (Voice over IP) telephone calls, and multimedia
   conferences. Service providers may have policies that apply to the
   media types negotiated for SIP sessions and hence it is necessary for
   proxy servers to be able to influence the Session Description
   Protocol negotiation during SIP session establishment and
   modification.

   This document specifies an alternative policy channel mechanism,
   enabling a user agent (i.e. a mobile device) to send session policy
   requests to a policy network component (e.g. a policy server) using a
   lower layer protocol (e.g. EAP and PPP), to obtain session policies,
   primarily for bandwidth constrained networks.

2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   A mixture of both EAP and SIP terminology is used within this
   document, with the following equivalence:

   EAP client = SIP user agent (UA) = Mobile Device
   EAP peer = Home Network Server = AAAh
   Authenticator = Intermediate Component (IC) = Gateway

   In addition, this document uses the following terms:

   ERP - EAP re-authentication Protocol

3. Session Policy

3.1. SIP background

   Using SIP for the policy channel provides a good general purpose
   solution for the internet being independent of the underlying policy
   and network architecture and ensures that all SIP user agents (mobile
   devices) can interact with any PNC.  However, for limited bandwidth
   access networks, such as cellular systems, the SIP Events framework
   [RFC 3265] is an inefficient realization of the policy channel. With
   limited bandwidth access networks the large SIP messages take a
   significant amount of time to be transported between the mobile
   device and a PNC.

3.2. 3GPP IMS

   3GPP has defined IMS as a next generation network architecture for
   establishing IP multimedia sessions including services such as
   multimedia telephony. Although originally developed for cellular
   networks, other technologies such as fixed line DSL networks and
   DOCSIS cable networks together with wireless technologies such as
   WLAN and WIMAX can be used to access IMS networks and work is
   currently in progress to use IMS for SIP based enterprise access and
   interconnect.

   3GPP has defined an architecture for Policy Control and Charging
   (PCC), realized by PNCs, that performs the necessary Authorization
   and Accounting functions for mobile device access to IMS bearer
   resources.  Typical PNCs are policy servers, entities with "Policy
   Control and Charging Rules Function" or "Policy Control and
   Enforcement Functions", which based on inputs from various sources,
   determines which mobile devices are allowed bearer access based on
   the attributes and characteristics of the session (such as the number
   of streams, the media types, and the codecs).

   Within these architectures, IMS PNCs are usually co-located with the
   AAA, so network paths are already established.

Internet-Draft   Session Policy Framework using EAP       January 2011


   As the separate PNCs within the PCC communicate using the Diameter or
   RADIUS protocol it is quite appropriate that a mature authentication
   protocol be considered for session policy establishment, operating
   within a Diameter and RADIUS AAA server regime.

   EAP is a good candidate because it allows a mobile device to
   communicate with AAA infrastructure. Its advantages are:

   1. IMS PNCs use Diameter or RADIUS and EAP already operates over
   these networks without requiring an upgrade.

   2. EAP is already implemented or will be implemented in many mobile
   terminals since EAP is specified for use by mobile terminals for
   authentication when using WLAN access.

   3. EAP is access independent and compatible for use with all the
   access networks and policy control architectures of the current IMS
   stakeholders.

   4. EAP is a lightweight protocol that is efficient for transport over
   bandwidth constrained access networks with minimal round trip delay
   and power consumption.

3.3. Management of Asynchronous Session Events

   Although EAP does show some advantages, it is primarily designed to
   be an authentication mechanism, which establishes a security
   association (SA), prior to any application session being considered.
   In this respect EAP exchanges are expected to occur once a wireless
   connection has been made, as opposed to every time a SIP session
   wishes to commence.

   However, using the EAP Re-authentication Protocol [RFC5296], it is
   possible to re-establish an EAP method independent tunnel, with a
   similar security association to that of the initial EAP exchange. It
   supports EAP re-authentication for a mobile device (i.e. the EAP
   peer) that has valid, unexpired key material from a previously
   performed EAP authentication

   In this manner, ERP can be utilized every time the mobile device
   wishes to initialize a SIP session.

4. Session policy channel

   An EAP based session policy channel is an alternative mechanism for
   implementing the policy channel defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-session-
   policy-framework] that builds upon the capabilities that exist in IMS

   these bandwidth constrained networks.

         === Session Policy Channel
         *** Media


                  Figure 1 - Session Policy Architecture

   Figure 1 illustrates a system in which SPEs are sent by encapsulating
   the messages within EAP. In the process of authenticating the mobile
   device, a lower layer communication path (equivalent to a session
   policy channel) is created between the mobile device and the PNC.

   The mobile device sends the session policy request to a PNC using a
   generic message (section 6.1. ) encapsulated within an EAP TLV
   message [I-D.draft-cam-winget-eap-tlv]. The session policy response
   sends the resulting session policy documents from the PNC back to the
   mobile device.

   Although only one PNC is shown in Figure 1, multiple PNCs could be
   present in the system.

4.1. Session Policy Documents

   Session policy documents are typically the info offer, info answer ,
   policy offer and policy answer, which define policy as stated in [I-
   D.ietf-sip-session-policy-framework].

   These documents are carried within the SPE messages as shown in
   section 6.

   The mobile device gains access to the PNC to obtain the session
   policy documents based on a URI (Uniform Resource Indicator) provided
   in the SPE message header.

  4.1.1. Network Triggered Policy Change

   For session-dependent policies, if the session policies change during
   a session (because of a change in the available radio resources, for
   example due to congestion or change of access network type), the PNC
   sends a modified session policy document (Figure 4) to the mobile
   device to inform it that the policies have changed so that the mobile
   device can re-start a new SPE, which re-negotiates the session
   policy.

5. Architecture Considerations

   The SPEs are access network agnostic.  The SPE passes through an IC
   (e.g. gateway, access point, network access server) between the
   mobile device and the PNC. The mobile device connects to an IC via
   one or more of several different wired (e.g. DSL networks and DOCSIS)
   or wireless (e.g. WLAN and WiMAX) access network technologies.

   Essentially a lower layer protocol (e.g. a wired or wireless protocol
   together with EAP) is used for transporting the session policy
   request between the mobile device and the IC, and then another lower
   layer protocol (e.g. RADIUS or Diameter together with EAP) transports
   the session policy request between the IC and the PNC.

   Since these architectures typically rely on Diameter or RADIUS based
   PNCs, the mobile device can transmit SPEs to the PCN, regardless of
   which access networks the mobile device uses to finally connect to
   the network.

5.1. Session Policy Exchange (SPE)

   From a single PNC, together with the appropriate AAA servers (such as
   other PNCs), the SPEs can traverse many other network components and
   cross domains.  This potentially enables a PNC at the edge of the
   network (subject to service agreements) to communicate with other
   PNCs in other domains in order to supply a composite policy document
   reflecting the policies from multiple domains that the SIP signaling
   request traverses.

   The mobile device can contact many PNCs via a single SPE with its
   home PNC (PNCh). The PNCh contacts other visited PNCs (PNCv) and
   returns their policy documents back to the PNCh where they are

   aggregated before returning that aggregated policy information to the
   mobile device.

   Thus the mobile device can potentially obtain a single policy
   document that reflects the session policies of all the impacted
   domains in a single SPE instead of having to contact multiple PNCs
   individually.

   As the mobile device transmits a session policy request to the PNC
   using a tunneled EAP protocol (e.g. using EAP-FAST or EAP-TTLS), the
   SPE is secure within an authenticated outer tunnel.

  5.1.1. Session Policy Channel Initialization

   The following message flow illustrates how a mobile device initiates
   the session policy channel.

                    Figure 2 - EAP Tunnel Initialization

   Message Details:

   (1) EAP Method Exchange (tunnel initialization)

   An EAP exchange is performed between the mobile device and the PNC
   with the authentication messages being forwarded to the home network
   AAA server. It is assumed that the PNCh is co-located with the AAAh.
   A suitable EAP method is used to establish a tunnel (e.g. EAP-FAST),
   from which the relevant ERP keys are derived for subsequent use
   [RFC5296].

    (2) [SIP registration with PNCh]

   Although not a part of the layer 2 exchange, it is worth showing that
   SIP registration between the mobile device and the PNCh occurs at
   this point. Subsequent SIP level flows are not shown.

Internet-Draft   Session Policy Framework using EAP       January 2011


   A visited PNC changes the session policy (most likely whilst the
   mobile device session is on-going) and indicates to the PNCh that a
   policy change has occurred.

   (10) AAA (Policy Change Event)

   The PNCh sends a policy change event message to the IC (most likely
   within RADIUS or Diameter)

   (11) EAP Initiate/Re-auth-Start

   The IC requests the mobile device to execute the ERP.

   The rest of the message flow continues, as described above in section
   5.1.2.

6. Encapsulation of SPEs

   The SPE comprises identification, routing and session policy
   documents, which allows the policy information to be generated
   (typically within the session policy documents themselves), as the
   SPEs traverse the network.

   The SPE is encapsulated within an EAP type-length-value (TLV)
   structure between the mobile device and the PCNh and within a
   RADIUS/Diameter AVP message for the onward network traversal between
   the PCNh and PCNv(s).

6.1. Encapsulation within an TLV

   [I-D.draft-cam-winget-eap-tlv] explains how type-length-value (TLV)
   structures, may be used to transport the SPE from the mobile device
   to a PNC within a secure tunnel.

   The SPE TLV is defined as follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   Session Policy Change Event
      This is a message which indicates to the IC, that the session
   policy within the network has changed. It triggers the IC to send an
   EAP-Initiate to the mobile device, requesting that a further SPE be
   re-started.

7. Use with SIP

   The EAP mechanisms described above can be used by the mobile device
   for obtaining both session-independent policies and session-specific
   policies, as defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-session-policy-framework].  The
   above discussion focuses on obtaining session-specific polices, but
   the mechanisms can also be used by the mobile device prior to session
   establishment to obtain session-independent policies.

   In addition to media policies, the mechanisms defined herein can be
   used to inform the mobile device to use a different IP address in the
   SDP Offer or Answer, to navigate firewalls or NATs, or to route media
   via a transcoder or other media relay as defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-
   session-policy-framework].

8. Security Considerations

   Session policies can significantly change the behavior of a mobile
   device and can be used by an attacker to compromise such a device.
   For example, session policies can be used to prevent a mobile device
   from successfully establishing a session (e.g., by setting the
   available bandwidth to zero). Such a policy can be submitted to the
   mobile device during a session, which causes the mobile device to
   terminate the session.

   For transmissions over the air, [I-D. draft-cam-winget-eap-tlv]
   assures that the SPE (encapsulated within an EAP TLV) is transmitted
   within an authenticated tunnel using a suitable EAP method (e.g. EAP-
   FAST or EAP-TTLS)

11. Specific Transport Mechanism

   The following specific transport mechanisms could be considered for
   transporting EAP session policy information:

      . IP-CAN (IP (Internet Protocol) Connectivity Access Network) via
        IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange version 2) as per RFC 5269.

      . PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) as per RFC 2284.

      . wired IEEE 802 LANs (IEEE-802.1X).
      . IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (IEEE-802.11).

   Using any of these transport protocols, EAP messages are sent at a
   lower protocol layer than the SIP messages themselves, which are
   typically sent at the application layer.

Abstract

   A new proposal is presented for speeding up the acquisition by the
   MAG of the MN's active multicast subscription information, in order
   to accelerate the multicast delivery to the MN during handover. To do
   that, an extension of the current PMIPv6 protocol is required. The
   solution described in this memo is not only applicable to the base
   multicast solution, but also it can be applied to other solutions
   envisioned as possible architectural evolutions of it. Furthermore,
   it is also independent of the role played by the MAG within the
   multicast metwork (either acting as MLD proxy or multicast router).

INTERNET DRAFT     Rapid acquisition of subscription       June 29, 2010


1  Introduction

   Recently, a base solution has been adopted for continuous multicast
   service delivery in PMIPv6 domains [4]. That solution specifies the
   basic functionality needed in the PMIPv6 entities to provide a
   multicast service, and supports the continuous delivery of multicast 
   obtaining the on-going multicast subscription information directly
   from the MN after handover. Thus, once the MN attaches to a new MAG,
   the MN is interrogated by the MAG through an MLD General Query, which
   is sent just after any new link sets up, to get knowledge of any
   existing subscription, as specified in [2].

   However, as highlighted by [5], the base solution must be improved to
   cover some performance requirements, especially those referred to the
   user perceived service quality, seriously affected by the disruption
   of multicast content forwarding to the MN during handovers.

   The method used in the base solution to get knowledge of an existing
   multicast subscription relies on the intrinsics of the IGMP/MLD
   protocols. Both protocols send multicast membership interrogation
   messages when a new link is up. The answer to that request will
   report any existing multicast subscription by the MN.

   Due to this behaviour, despite of being a straightforward method, the
   MAG can incur in a huge delay in receiving the corresponding MLD
   Report message caused by either the MLD query processing time or the
   radio transfer delays associated with this procedure.

   The new approach proposed here consists of the extension of the
   current PMIPv6 signaling protocol defined in [1] by including a new
   multicast information option to update PMIPv6 entities during
   registration and de-registration processes, as well as new messages
   to trigger the transfer of such multicast information. No extension
   is considered for any of the multicast-related protocols (IGMP/MLD
   nor PIM protocols).

   This proposal intends to provide a signaling method internal to the
   network to speed up the subscription information acquisition by the
   MAG, in order to accelerate the multicast delivery to the MN. By
   doing so, the knowledge by the MAG of the currently active multicast
   subscription becomes independent of the underlying radio technology
   dynamics and relaxes the requirement of a rapid response from the MN
   in processing MLD control messages. Issues like radio framing, radio
   access contention, channel reliability, IGMP/MLD timers optimisation
   for wireless environments, etc, are not relevant any more to
   determine multicast performance after handoff.

   The solution described in this memo is not only applicable to the

   base solution defined in [4], but also it can be applied to other
   solutions envisioned as possible architectural evolutions of it, as
   those stated in [6] or [7]. Furthermore, it is also independent of
   the role played by the MAG within the multicast network (either
   acting as MLD proxy or multicast router).


1.1  Conventions and Terminology

   This document uses the terminology referring to PMIPv6 components as
   defined in [1]. Additionally, the following terms are defined.

   pMAG
      The previous MAG or pMAG is the MAG where the MN is initially
      registered in a handover event.

   nMAG
      The new MAG or nMAG is the MAG where the MN is finally registered
      in a handover event.

   Reactive Handover
      A reactive handover is a handover event where the LMA receives the
      MN registration from the nMAG without having previously received
      the MN de-registration from the pMAG.

   Predictive handover
      A predictive handover is a handover event where the LMA firstly
      receives the MN de-registration from the pMAG previously to
      receive the MN registration from the nMAG.

2  Overview 

   The LMA is a key element within the PMIPv6 infrastructure. It traces
   the MN reachability along the PMIPv6 domain, therefore the LMA is the
   best element to store and forward the multicast subscription
   information to the rest of entities within the PMIPv6, that is, to
   the MAGs, as the MN moves.

   The LMA only requires to know the detailed subscription information
   (in terms of the IP addresses of both the multicast group subscribed,
   G, and the source delivering it, S) during the handover event. Apart
   from the handover event, it is not worthy to continuously inform the
   LMA about it. Such procedure would significantly increase the
   signaling load within the PMIPv6 domain without a clear benefit. The
   subscription information (S,G) is only critical during handover,
   neither after nor before. Indicating the active subscription while
   the handover is ongoing guarantees that such information will be up-
   to-date, ready to be transferred to the new MAG where the MN has just
   attached.

   To do that, it will be necessary to extend the PMIPv6 protocol in
   several ways. First of all, a new mobility option is needed to pack
   the IP addresses of the current multicast subscription. Furthermore,
   additional messages are required to manage the interchange of the
   multicast information among PMIPv6 entities. Finally, some flags are
   defined to govern the process.

   Next sections provide the details.

3  PMIPv6 extensions

   This section outlines the extensions proposed to the PMIPv6 protocol
   specified in [1].

3.1  New "Active Multicast Subscription" mobility option

3.1.1  Option application rules

   A new TLV-encoded mobility option, "Active Multicast Subscription"
   option is defined for use with the PBU and PBA messages exchanged
   between an LMA and a MAG to transfer the multicast subscription
   information. This option is used for exchanging the IP addresses of
   both the group subscribed by the MN, and the source delivering it as
   well. There can be multiple "Active Multicast Subscription" options
   present in the message, one for each active subscription maintained
   by the MN when the handover is taken place.

   This new option will be used, with the same aim, also by the new
   message Subscription Response described later in this document.

3.1.2  Option format

   The format of this new option is as follows:
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
                                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   |      Type     |     Length    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   +                  Multicast Source IP address                  +
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   +                  Multicast Group IP address                   +
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type
      To be defined

   Length
      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length of the option in
      octects, excluding the type and length fields. This field must be
      set to the value 8 for IPv4, and 32 for IPv6. 

   Multicast Source IP address

      Unicast IP address of the node which injects the multicast content
      in the network.

   Multicast Group IP address
      Multicast IP address identifying the content which the MN
      subscribes to.

3.2  New "multicast Signaling" flag on PBU/PBA message headers

3.2.1  Flag application rules

   A new flag S is added in both PBU and PBA message headers to advise
   about the MAG and the LMA capabilities of processing multicast-
   related signaling for the MN subject of the message.

   This flag will govern the multicast-related signaling between the LMA
   and the MAG. As a general rule, the value of the flag in the PBA
   message should be a copy of the value received in the PBU message.
   Specific rules are described in next sub-sections.

3.2.1.1  Registration process

   These rules apply for the Initial Binding registration process.

   o PBU message

      * S=0, it indicates that the MAG sending the PBU message does not
      accept multicast-related signaling for the MN being attached. This
      can be used to discriminate PMIPv6 nodes which are not multicast
      enabled, for backward compatibility reasons.

      * S=1, it indicates that the MAG sending the PBU message accepts
      multicast-related signaling for the MN being attached. Depending
      on the type of handover (reactive or predictive) the LMA will take
      some actions, described later in this document.

   o PBA message

      * If S=0 in the corresponding PBU message, the value of the flag
      in the PBA message should be a copy of the value received in the
      PBU message, without any further meaning.

      * If S=1 in the corresponding PBU message, two sub-cases can
      happen

         o S=1 in the PBA message if the multicast subscription
         information is provided in this message for the MN. When S=1,
         if the MN maintains an active multicast session, the PBA

         message will include the "Active Multicast Subscription"
         mobility option with the IP addresses of the subscribed group
         and the source providing it.

         o S=0 in the PBA message if the multicast subscription
         information is not provided in this message for the MN. The PBA
         message will include the "Active Multicast Subscription"
         mobility option with the IP addresses of the group and the
         source set to 0. This case is useful to decouple unicast and
         multicast signaling for a MN being registered at nMAG. A way
         for obtaining later active multicast-subscription information
         is described later in this document.

3.2.1.2  De-registration process

   These rules apply for the Binding De-registration process

   o PBU message

      * S=0, it indicates that the MN has no active multicast session.

      * S=1, it indicates that the MN has an active multicast session,
      and the IP addresses of the subscribed group and the source
      providing it are transported in the "Active Multicast
      Subscription" mobility option.

   o PBA message

   The value of the flag in the PBA message should be a copy of the
   value received in the PBU message, without any further meaning.

3.2.2  New format of conventional PBU/PBA messages

3.2.2.1  Proxy Binding Update Message

   As result of the new defined flag, the PBU message results as
   follows:

3.3  New optional "multicast Active" flag on LMA Binding Cache

3.3.1  Flag application rules

   A new optional flag A is added in the LMA Binding Cache to retain the
   knowledge that the registered MN maintains or not an active multicast
   subscription. The basic use of this flag is to restrict the
   interrogation of the pMAG only to the cases in which the MN certainly
   is maintaining an active subscription.

   The algorithm which is followed by the LMA to interrogate or not the
   pMAG (after receiving a PBU message from the nMAG) is as follows:

      - Flag S=0 & flag A=0: this situation represents the case where
      the nMAG does not support multicast-related signaling for the MN
      being registered, and, additionally, the LMA is not aware of any
      active multicast subscription on-going. Then, the LMA does not
      interrogate the pMAG, and registers the MN as attached to the nMAG
      as usual.

      - Flag S=0 & flag A=1: this situation represents the case where
      the nMAG does not support multicast-related signaling for the MN
      being registered, but the LMA is aware of one or more on-going
      MN's active multicast subscriptions. Due that multicast signaling
      is not supported by the nMAG for that MN, the LMA does not
      interrogate the pMAG, and registers the MN as attached to the nMAG
      as usual.

      - Flag S=1 & flag A=0: this situation represents the case where
      the nMAG supports multicast-related signaling for the MN being
      registered, but the LMA is not aware of any active multicast
      subscription. Then, the LMA does not interrogate the pMAG, and
      registers the MN as attached to the nMAG as usual.

      - Flag S=1 & flag A=1: this situation represents the case where
      the nMAG supports multicast-related signaling for the MN being
      registered, and, additionally, the LMA is aware of one or more on-
      going MN's active multicast subscriptions. Then, the LMA
      interrogates the pMAG to obtain the multicast subscription details
      in the form of (S,G) previously to complete the registration of
      the MN attached to the nMAG.

   The flag A should be initialized to the value 0.

3.4  New messages for active multicast subscription interrogation

   A new pair of messages is defined for interrogating entities about
   the active multicast subscription of the MN when the handover is of
   reactive type.

   These messages are sent using the Mobility Header as defined in [3].

3.4.1  Subscription Query message

3.4.1.1  Message application rules

   The Subscription Query message is sent by the LMA towards the pMAG to
   interrogate it about any existing multicast subscription of the MN
   which is being registered by the nMAG. This message is generated in
   case of the handover is of reactive type.

   Additionally, this message is sent by the nMAG towards the LMA to
   interrogate it about the existing multicast subscription of the MN
   when the LMA acknowledges the PBU sent by the nMAG but the multicast
   information is not provided (in detail, when the PBU messages has set
   the flag S to 1, and the PBA message has set the flag S to 0).

      The Multicast Activity Indication message is sent by a MAG towards
      the LMA to set to 1 or 0 the A flag either to indicate the start
      or the complete cease of any multicast subscription by the MN.
      Through the use of this message, the LMA becomes aware that one or
      more multicast flows are being forwarded to a MN. This information
      is useful for the LMA during a handover to discriminate if the
      pMAG should be asked or not about multicast information
      corresponding to the MN being registered at the nMAG, in case of
      the handover is of reactive type.

3.5.1.2  Message format

3.6  New "PBA timer" in the LMA

   A new timer named "PBA timer" is used in the LMA to define the
   maximum waiting time before the PBA message is sent to the nMAG in
   case the multicast subscription information relative to the MN is not
   yet available. The aim of this timer is to prevent potential large
   delays in the forwarding of unicast traffic towards the MN being
   registered at the nMAG. This timer allows to decouple the unicast
   signaling from the multicast one.

   This timer should be upper bounded by the constant defined in [3]
   INIT_BINDACK_TIMEOUT, which value is 1 s. This constant sets the time
   when the nMAG will retry the MN registration by sending again the PBU
   message. The "PBA timer" has to ensure that the nMAG does not enter
   the retry mode.

4  Signaling process description

   As the MN moves from one access gateway (named previous-MAG, pMAG) to
   another (named new-MAG, nMAG), the mobility-related signaling due to
   the handover event is carried out independently by the pMAG and the
   nMAG. That signaling process is not synchronized and, thus, two
   scenarios should be considered depending on the order in which the
   LMA receives notification of the MN registration and de-registration
   in the nMAG and the pMAG respectively.

4.1  Handover of predictive type

4.1.1  Rationale

   In the predictive case, the LMA firstly receives the MN de-
   registration from the pMAG previously to receive the MN registration
   from the nMAG.

   Only for those MNs which maintain an active multicast subscription,
   the pMAG will include as part of the PBU message (with flag S set to
   1) the new TLV-encoded mobility option "Active Multicast
   Subscription" carrying the IP addresses of the multicast
   subscription(s) active in the MN at that moment. 

   The LMA will store that information in the corresponding binding
   cache. If, later on, the MN attaches to a nMAG, this information will
   be sent (using the same TLV option) to the nMAG as part of the PBA
   confirmation of the registration process (the PBU message sent by the
   nMAG should set the flag S to 1). On the other hand, if no further
   registration happens, the multicast information will be removed
   together with the rest of binding database for that MN.

   After receiving the multicast addresses of the group(s) subscribed by
   the MN, and the source(s) delivering it(them), the nMAG can subscribe
   the multicast flow on behalf of the MN, if there is no other MN
   receiving it already at the nMAG. The multicast status can be also
   set in advance for the point-to-point link towards the MN.

4.1.2  Message flow description

   The figure 1 summarizes this process.

                     Figure 1. Predictive handover

   The sequence of messages is the following:

   1) A registered MN is receiving a multicast content which has been
   previously subscribed by sending an standard MLD report from the MN
   to the currently serving MAG, pMAG. The pMAG keeps the multicast
   status state of the point-to-point link with the MN.

INTERNET DRAFT     Rapid acquisition of subscription       June 29, 2010


   2) The MN perceives a better radio link and decides to initiate a
   handover process over a radio access controlled by a new MAG, nMAG.
   As consequence, pMAG determines a detach event corresponding to this
   MN, and updates the attachment status of this MN to the LMA by
   sending an extended Proxy Binding Update message, including a new
   TLV-encoded option, named "Active Multicast Subscription", which
   contains the IP addresses of the (S,G) pairs of the active multicast
   subscriptions in the moment of handover.

   3) The LMA processes the PBU message. Additionally, the LMA stores in
   the Binding Cache the information regarding the on-going multicast
   subscription when the handover has been initiated. This information
   will be kept until a new registration of the MN is completed by
   another MAG, or till the Binding Cache expiration, according to [1].

   4) The LMA acknowledges to the pMAG the previous PBU message.

   5) As a result of the handover process, the MN attaches to another
   MAG, called nMAG.

   6) The nMAG triggers a registration process by sending a PBU message
   (with flag S set to 1) to the LMA.

   7) After the analysis of the PBU message, the LMA sends an extended 
   PBA including the new "Active Multicast Subscription" option,  which
   contains the IP addresses of the (S,G) pairs of the active multicast
   subscriptions in the moment of handover.

   8) The nMAG processes the PBA message, following all the standard
   procedures described in [1]. Additionally, with the new information
   relative to multicast subscription, the nMAG will set up the
   multicast status of the point-to-point link between the nMAG and the
   MN, and will join the content identified by (S,G) on behalf of the MN
   in case the nMAG is not receiving already such content due to a
   previous subscription ordered by another present MN attached to it.
   From that instant, the multicast content is served to the MN.


4.2  Handover of reactive type

4.2.1  Rationale

   In the reactive case, the LMA receives the MN registration from the
   nMAG without having previously received the MN de-registration from
   the pMAG.

   As the nMAG is not aware of any active multicast subscription of the
   MN, the nMAG will start a conventional registration process, by

INTERNET DRAFT     Rapid acquisition of subscription       June 29, 2010


   sending a normal PBU message (with flag S set to 1) towards the LMA.

   After receiving the PBU message from the nMAG, the LMA will take the
   decision of interrogating or not the pMAG regarding any existing
   multicast subscription for that MN.

   Once the multicast subscription information is retrieved from the
   pMAG, the LMA encapsulates it in the PBA message by using the TLV
   option "Active Multicast Subscription", and forwards the PBA message
   to the nMAG. Then, the nMAG can subscribe the multicast flow on
   behalf of the MN, if there is no other MN receiving it already at the
   nMAG. The multicast status can be also set in advance for the point-
   to-point link towards the MN.

              Figure 2a. Reactive handover (steps 1 to 2)

   The sequence of messages is the following:

   1) A pair of MNs, named MN1 and MN2, are attached to the pMAG. Both
   MNs are multicast-enabled nodes, and both MNs are only receiving
   unicast traffic as usual in PMIPv6 domains, with no multicast
   subscription yet. At some point of time, the MN1 request to the pMAG

   to be subscribed to the content identified by the IP addresses (S,G),
   by sending an standard MLD report from the MN to the pMAG. The pMAG
   will keep the multicast status state of the point-to-point link with
   the MN. The multicast flow (S,G) is then forwarded by the pMAG to the
   MN1.

   2) Due to this initial multicast subscription for the MN1, the pMAG
   triggers the multicast Activity Indication message towards the LMA,
   to indicate that the MN1 multicast activity is on. The LMA will set
   the flag A to 1. Afterwards, the LMA sends an Activity Indication Ack
   message to the pMAG to acknowledge the previous indication.

              Figure 2b. Reactive handover (steps 3 to 7)

   3) Some time later, the MN1 perceives a better radio link and decides
   to attach at a new MAG, nMAG, in a handover process (as a reactive
   case, the pMAG is not aware of the detachment process). Then, the
   nMAG triggers a registration process by sending a PBU message (with
   flag S set to 1) to the LMA.

   4) Prior to acknowledge the received PBU message, the LMA checks the
   status of the A flag for this MN. Due that the flag A=1, the LMA
   interrogates the pMAG about if there is any active multicast
   subscription for the MN1, by sending a Subscription Query message.

   5) The pMAG answers the LMA with a Subscription Response message
   including the IP addresses of the existing subscriptions (the pair
   (S,G) in this case).

   6) After processing the pMAG answer, the LMA acknowledges the PBU
   message, including the multicast subscription information within the
   new TLV-encoded option "Active Multicast Subscription". The nMAG then
   process the extended PBA message.

   7) The nMAG processes the PBA message, and it proceeds to set up the
   multicast status of the point-to-point link between the nMAG and the
   MN1, and to join the content identified by (S,G) on behalf of the MN1
   in case the nMAG is not receiving already such content. (The
   bidirectional tunnel is also set up between the nMAG and the LMA if
   it has not been established before by another MN connection). At this
   moment, the multicast content can be served to the MN1. The unicast
   traffic for the MN1 can be forwarded as well.

   traffic forwarding to the MN1.

   9) After removing the active subscriptions for the MN1, the nMAG
   sends a multicast Activity Indication message to the LMA indicating
   that the MN1 multicast activity is off. The LMA will set the flag A
   to 0, its default value. Afterwards, the LMA sends an Activity
   Indication Ack message to the nMAG to acknowledge the previous
   indication.

   10) In parallel, the MN2 perceives a better radio link and decides to
   attach also to the nMAG, in a reactive handover process as well (the
   pMAG is neither aware of the detachment process). Then, the nMAG
   triggers a registration process by sending a PBU message (with flag S
   set to 1) to the LMA.

   11) Prior to acknowledge the received PBU message, the LMA checks the
   status of the A flag for this MN. Due that the flag A=0, the LMA does
   not interrogate the pMAG, and acknowledges the PBU message. The nMAG
   then process the extended PBA message.

   12) The nMAG is now ready to forward the unicast traffic to the MN2.

4.2.3  Further considerations for the reactive handover signaling

   A handover event is managed independently by the pMAG and nMAG. It is
   not a synchronized process. In a reactive handover, the LMA will
   receive a registration PBU from nMAG before a de-registration PBU
   from pMAG, if any.

   In the message flows detailed above, it could be the case that the
   LMA receives a de-registration PBU from pMAG just after sending the
   Subscription Query message, but before receiving the Subscription
   Response message. That de-registration PBU message from pMAG will
   carry the multicast subscription information required to assist the
   MN in the handover, so such valuable information should be kept by
   the LMA. Furthermore, it is possible that once the Subscription Query
   message arrives to pMAG, the pMAG could have already removed the
   multicast related information for the MN.

   In order to not loose the multicast subscription information sent in
   the de-registration PBU message, the LMA should store it, and include
   it in the PBA message towards the nMAG in case the Subscription
   Response message from the pMAG does not contain multicast
   subscription information for the MN.


4.2.4  Prevention of large delays of the binding acknowledgement for
   unicast traffic

   Attending to the message sequences detailed above for reactive
   handovers, in case the LMA has to request the multicast subscription
   information to the pMAG, the binding request sent by the nMAG is
   maintained on-hold till the LMA receives, processes and includes the
   multicast subscription information into the extended PBA message. As
   consequence, the unicast traffic may then suffer an extra delay
   motivated by the multicast-related signaling. During that time, the
   unicast traffic with destination the MN being registered by the nMAG
   must be buffered or discarded by the LMA.

   In order to avoid any potential large delay in the forwarding of
   unicast traffic arriving to the LMA towards the MN, a mechanism
   should be implemented to decouple multicast from unicast traffic
   reception by the MN.

   The figures 3a and 3b show this mechanism:

   The sequence of messages is the following:

   1) An MN, named MN1, is attached to the pMAG. The MN is a multicast-

   2) Some time later, the MN1 perceives a better radio link and decides
   to attach at a new MAG, nMAG, in a handover process (as a reactive
   case, the pMAG is not aware of the detachment process). Then, the
   nMAG triggers a registration process by sending a PBU message (with
   flag S set to 1) to the LMA.

   3) Prior to acknowledge the received PBU message, the LMA decides to
   interrogate the pMAG about if there is any active multicast
   subscription for the MN1, by sending a Subscription Query message.
   The LMA decision is based on the checking of flag A when the reactive
   handover manages the multicast activity indication.

   4) Immediately after sending the Subscription Query message, the LMA
   starts the timer "PBA timer", which duration determines the maximum
   waiting time before the PBA is sent to avoid any potential large
   delay in the forwarding of unicast traffic towards the MN.

   5) In case the "PBA timer" expires, the LMA acknowledges the PBU
   message, by sending the PBA message with flag S=0. The nMAG then
   processes the extended PBA message. Such acknowledgement will allow
   the MN to receive the unicast traffic from that time on. (The
   bidirectional tunnel is also set up between the nMAG and the LMA if
   it has not been established before by another MN connection).

   6) In parallel, the nMAG sends a Subscription Query message to the
   LMA requesting the multicast-subscription details yet unknown for the
   MN.

   7) The pMAG answers the Subscription Query message originally sent by
   the LMA, including the IP addresses of the existing subscriptions
   (the pair (S,G) in this case).

   8) After processing the pMAG answer, the LMA sends a Subscription
   Response message to the nMAG, including the multicast subscription
   information within the new TLV-encoded option "Active Multicast
   Subscription". The nMAG processes the PBA message, and it proceeds to
   set up the multicast status of the point-to-point link between the
   nMAG and the MN1, and to join the content identified by (S,G) on
   behalf of the MN1 in case the nMAG is not receiving already such
   content. (The bidirectional tunnel is also set up between the nMAG
   and the LMA if it has not been established before by another MN
   connection). At this moment, the multicast content can also be served
   to the MN.

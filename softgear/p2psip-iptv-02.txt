Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage               October 2009 
    

    

1. Introduction 

   RELOAD provides distributed storage and distributed service [I-
   D.ietf-p2psip-base]. RELOAD does not only support SIP based VoIP 
   service[I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip] but also other services. This IPTV Usage 
   of RELOAD allows a node to store or fetch various P2P IPTV related 
   information within the overlay. 

   Nowadays, Streaming service and User Create Contents are getting more 
   popular. The number of streaming channel is growing up very quickly. 
   They require huge storage and high bandwidth. It seems also 
   impossible that central servers cover all streaming and clients. For 
   economic reasons, P2P streaming must be used. There are already some 
   P2P based streaming services. Some standardization groups have been 
   starting to make a standard for P2P streaming. 

   This document provides the method to use the RELOAD overlay as a 
   distributed P2P IPTV server. The RELOAD overlay can store meta data 
   about IPTV channel. And, The RELOAD overlay can store list of the 
   peers which are attending P2P IPTV streaming. Although this document 
   focuses on Live P2P IPTV service, one can use this method for VoD or 
   another streaming service. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

   The concepts used in this document are compatible with "Concepts and 
   Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP" [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] and the 
   P2PSIP base protocol RELOAD[I-D.ietf-p2psip-base]. 

   Channel : a media stream from a content provider to viewers.  

   Channel ID : a globally unique ID which identifies a certain channel. 
   It may be a human readable ID. 

   Hashed Channel ID : a result of hash function of Channel ID. To store 
   channel information to the overlay, channel ID should be hashed. 

   Content Provider : a source entity which produces media for channel 
   to others.

   Viewer : an entity which receives media from other peers. A Viewer 
   may/may not upload media stream to others. Client is an entity which 
   does not upload media stream while it is downloading media. 

   Metadata : All description and information about a certain channel. 
   It includes title, category, language, credit, and so on. It may be 
   used to find a certain channel. 

   User : a person handles a certain agent. 

   Agent : a entity helps a User. A software which has user interface 
   and communication protocols. 

    

3. P2P IPTV Architectures 

3.1. Tracker based architecture 

   Tracker based P2P IPTV architecture is a simple and basic 
   architecture. The following figure shows this type of architecture. 

   .+--------+ 
    | Server | 
    +--------+ 
     ^  
     |           +----------+ 
     |  +------->|  Tracker | (peer list) 
     |  |        +----------+ 
     |  | all peer list 
     |  |                        +--------+ 
     v  v        +-------------> | Peer A | 
    +--------+   |               +--------+ 
    | Peer J |<--+               +--------+ 
    +--------+   +-------------> | Peer B | 
                 |               +--------+ 
                 |               +--------+ 
                 +-------------> | Peer C | 
                                 +--------+ 
    

   There is the server which stores channel information. This server 
   gives tracker information of a certain channel to new joining peer. 
   Tracker information includes tracker's IP address. The new joining 
   peer (Peer J in the figure) connects to the tracker and asks a peer 
   list. Tracker stores all peer list. This peer list includes IP 
   address and port number of all peers which attend to the same channel. 
 
 
Seokkap, et al.        Expires April 24, 2010                 [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage               October 2009 
    

   The Content Provider of this channel is also included in this peer 
   list. After the joining peer (Peer J) receives all peer list from the 
   tracker, this peer checks which peer is the best peer in the peer 
   list(Peer A,B,C in the figure). There are some methods to find the 
   best peer among peers. For example, measuring RTT to each candidate 
   peer is a simple method. Using (geographical) location information 
   from IP address or the network coordinate[GNP] is one of useful 
   methods. These methods consider peer's capabilities such as upload 
   bandwidth. After Peer J finds the best peer(Peer A, for example) in 
   the list, Peer J connects Peer A and asks Peer A to send media. After 
   Peer J receives media stream from peer A, Peer J registers itself to 
   the tracker. Peer J is added into the peer list in the tracker. The 
   main feature of this architecture is that a tracker stores only a 
   peer list for the channel. This peer list includes only coarse 
   information about peer such as IP address and port. 

   Instead that a tracker provides all peer list for a new joining peer, 
   a tracker can give initial random peer list. A peer can use gossiping 
   which selects other random peers and communicate with each other to 
   get more peers. 

3.2. Server-controlled architecture 

   In contrast to the tracker based architecture, server-controlled P2P 
   IPTV architecture uses a control server. This server stores all 
   information about the channel. This information includes a peer list 
   and virtual link information of the overlay. The following figure 
   shows this architecture. 

   .            +----------------+ 
       +------->| Control Server | (overlay topology) 
       |        +----------------+ 
       |best candidate peer 
       |                         +--------+ 
       v         +-------------> | Peer A | 
    +--------+   |               +--------+ 
    | Peer J | --+               +--------+ 
    +--------+   +-------------> | Peer B | 
                                 +--------+ 
    

   A new joining peer (Peer J) connects the control server. Peer J finds 
   the channel from the server and asks the server for the peer list. 
   The control server calculates virtual distances from Peer J to the 
   existing peers in overlay topology and finds the better candidate 
   peers for Peer J in the peer list. The virtual distance is a logical 
   distance reflecting bandwidth and delay between two peers. In 
 
 
Seokkap, et al.        Expires April 24, 2010                 [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage               October 2009 
    

   contrast to the tracker based architecture, the control server does 
   not give all peer list to the joining peer (Peer J). Instead of all 
   peer list, the control server gives small number of peer list which 
   are the better candidates (Peer A,B, in the figure) for the joining 
   peer. Peer J selects the best peer among the candidates(Peer A,B). If 
   Peer J selects Peer A as the best peer, Peer J notifies the control 
   server that Peer J selects to Peer A. The control server makes Peer A 
   send the media to Peer J. The control server knows everything about 
   this channel. i.e. The server knows who sends to who and who receives 
   from who. 

    

3.3. Full distributed architecture 

   Full distributed architecture replaces the control server with 
   DHT(distributed hash table). P2PSIP is one of DHT implementation [I-
   D.ietf-p2psip-base]. The following figure shows this architecture. 

   .            +----------------+ (meta data) 
       +------->| DHT (P2PSIP)   | (peer list) 
       |        +----------------+ 
       |  
       |                         +--------+ 
       v         +-------------> | Peer A | 
    +--------+   |               +--------+ 
    | Peer J | --+               +--------+ 
    +--------+   +-------------> | Peer B | 
                                 +--------+ 
    

   DHT stores meta data and peer list of channels in distributed manner. 
   A streaming channel has many meta data which describes this channel. 
   A user can find a certain channel by meta data searching. In the near 
   future, thousands of IPTV steam channels will be expected to be 
   emerging. Not only commercial content provider but also normal users, 
   devices, sensors, and CCTVs will be contributors for lots of IPTV 
   media stream channels. We need a realtime searching mechanism for 
   global channels. This distributed meta data storage is one of 
   realtime channel searching mechanism. Using P2PSIP event notification 
   extension[I-D.ietf-p2psip-event] , we can wait for a specific content 
   channel. 

   DHT stores peer list for each channel. Similar to server controlled 
   architecture, DHT provides the peer list and additional information 
   to the joining peer. The joining peer can use additional information 
   to select the best peer to connect. 
 
 
Seokkap, et al.        Expires April 24, 2010                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage               October 2009 
    

   For example scenario, first, Peer J sends keywords into DHT to find a 
   channel. DHT gives channel lists which has the matched metadata with 
   keywords. Peer J selects one channel in the channel list. Peer J 
   sends channel ID to DHT. DHT gives the peer list to Peer J. Peer J 
   selects the best peer in the list. Peer J asks Peer A to send media.  
   After that, Peer J registers its information into DHT as a peer in 
   the channel. 

   In mesh-full architectures or VoD services, DHT may stores chunk 
   information[I-D.chunk-discovery]. DHT helps to find who have a 
   certain chunk data in whole file or stream. However, chunk discovery 
   and registration process may cause overlay overload. To avoid this 
   problem, peers MAY exchange chunk map with each others. 

    

4. Metadata storage 

4.1. Overview 

   In Metadata storage, simply speaking, the input to DHT is keyword and 
   output is channel ID. User sends FetchReq message to DHT which 
   includes a hashed keyword and description type(title, actor, or 
   synopsis). The response, FetchAns, includes channel-ID and short 
   description or title for a quick view. 

   Contents Provider registers Metadata for each meaningful keyword to 
   P2PSIP DHT using StoreReq message. The resource name is keyword and 
   description type. The resource-ID is hashed value of the resource 
   name. StoreReq includes channel-ID and short description (for example, 
   title) for this channel. The responsible peer for this resource ID 
   should store these metadata. 

   User, especially Viewer, will search for a channel with keyword. 
   Viewer should send FetchReq to DHT. As a results, Viewer can get a 
   channel ID and short description. 

   The Metadata storage in this draft supports to store a full 
   description into DHT. The resource name of full description is 
   Channel-ID.  

   * Comment: The issue about large P2PSIP message has been discussed in 
   IETF P2PSIP working group. Even if WG decided to use small size 
   message only, this draft asks RELOAD to support as large message as 
   about 1M bytes. 


 
 
Seokkap, et al.        Expires April 24, 2010                 [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage               October 2009 
    

   To get notification of a specific channel registration, User MAY use 
   P2PSIP event notification extension [I-D.ietf-p2psip-event]. This 
   mechanism may be used for dynamic metadata where a meta data register 
   changes metadata frequently[MyEdir]. 

   If a Content Provider want to make own IPTV channel, it should make a 
   Channel ID, and describes this channel. And, it should register this 
   channel information into the DHT. 

   This document does not define the way to make Channel ID. But, 
   Channel ID MUST be globally unique. 

   In ordinary centralized IPTV, a Content Provider registers its 
   channel information to an IPTV server. However, in this draft, a 
   Contents Provider MAY register its channel information to the DHT. To 
   register its channel information, a RELOAD peer stores 
   IptvMetaKeyword structure or IptvMetaFullDesc structure. This draft 
   explains how to store meta data into a P2PSIP RELOAD overlay.  

4.2. Registering MetaKeyword 

   All Peers should work together to store metadata. A Content Provider 
   can request to store keywords and Channel-ID into the overlay. This 
   request is StoreReq that includes IptvMetaKeyword structure. Kind-ID 
   for this storage is IPTV-META-KEYWORD. Formal definition of IPTV-
   META-KETWORD is described in section 4.4 in this draft. 

   As a simple example, if the title of the channel is "Bob's live talk 
   show", the Content Provider MAY make 4 words (Bob,live,talk,show) as 
   title metadata keyword.  It hashes each word and stores each title 
   metadata keywords into the overlay. Each metadata will be stored in 
   distributed other peers. 

   The contents of the IptvMetaKeyword are as follows:

     enum {    
      iptv_metatype_title(1), 
      iptv_metatype_synopsys(2), 
      iptv_metatype_genre(3), 
      iptv_metatype_language(4), 
      iptv_metatype_cast(5), 
      iptv_metatype_group(6), 
      iptv_metatype_credit(7), 
      iptv_metatype_review(8), 
      iptv_metatype_crid(9), 
     } IptvMetaType; 
      
     struct { 
        IptvMetaType       type;  
       opaque             keyword<0..2^16-1>; 
       opaque             short_description<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque             channel_id<0..2^16-1>; 
     } IptvMetaKeyword; 
    

   The contents of the IptvMetaKeyword PDU are: 

   type 
     the description type of the metadata keyword. a number. 
    

   keyword 
     partial keyword. 
    

   short_description 
     short description about the content. This will be shown as a 
      result of the keyword searching. Normally, this is a title of the 
      content. 
    

   channel_id 
     the unhashed channel id 
    

4.3. Looking up MetaKeyword 

   When a Viewer wants to look up a certain channel with some keywords, 
   the look-up process is going to be done in the following order. 



 
 
Seokkap, et al.        Expires April 24, 2010                 [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage               October 2009 
    

   1. The user inputs keywords per each description type. 
   2. The Viewer Agent hashes the inputted keywords and looks up IPTV 
   metadata from the overlay. 
   3. The Viewer Agent lists up the result of looking-up in order. The 
   user can see the list of the channels which have keywords. This list 
   shows short description of each channel. 
   4. The user can choose one among the channels on the list. 
    
   A Viewer SHOULD make ResourceID by hashing the user inputted keyword 
   and description type. The Viewer sends FetchReq to the overlay, which 
   includes ResourceID and Kind-ID. Kind-ID in the FetchReq is IPTV-
   META-KEYWORD. 

   The Viewer can get the result of searching a specific keyword with 
   IptvMetaType. The result includes the short description of the 
   channel and Channel-ID. After the user choose the channel, Viewer 
   agent SHOULD look for Channel peer list. 

    

4.4. IPTV-META-KEYWORD Kind Definitions 

   The distributed IPTV metadata storage for keyword searching is 
   provided using the IPTV-META-KEYWORD Kind-ID: 

   o Kind ID - The Resource name for the IPTV-META-KEYWORD is 
      IptvMetaType and keyword. The format of Resource name is : 

      IptvMetaType "+" Keyword 

      The IptvMetaType in Resource Name is a char string. For example, 
      if the IptvMetaType is iptv_metatype_title and the keyword is 
      "Bob", the resource name is "1+Bob".  The data stored is a 
      IptvMetaKeyword, which contains short description and Channel ID. 

   o Data Model - The data model for the IPTV-META-KEYWORD is 
      dictionary. There MAY be many records with the same Resource-ID. 
      The dictionary key is the Channel-ID. A Peer can distinguish 
      stored items with Channel-ID. The data structure for IPTV-META-
      KEYWORD is IptvMetaKeyword 

   o Access Control - If certificate-based access control is being used, 
      stored data of Kind-ID IPTV-META-KEYWORD must be signed by 
      certificate which contains Channel-ID matching the Channel-ID in 
      IptvMetaKeyword structure.

4.5. Registering MetaFullDesc 

   When a Content Provider wants to store the full description about his 
   content, the Content Provider MAY use IptvMetaFullDesc structure to 
   store the full description about the channel into the overlay. User 
   also can get full description from the overlay before he watches it. 

   A Content Provider sends StoreReq to the overlay. The Resource Name 
   of this message is Channel-ID. The responsible peer of the hashed 
   channel-ID stores the requested IptvMetaFullDesc data structure. Kind 
   ID of this StoreReq is IPTV-META-FULLDESC. 

   The contents of the IptvMetaFullDesc are as follows: 

     struct { 
        opaque          title<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          synopsis<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          genre<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          language<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          cast<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          group<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          credit<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          review<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          crid<0..2^16-1>; 
     } ContentsDescription; 
      
     struct { 
        uint64           start_time; 
        uint64           finish_time; 
        opaque          contents_provider_name<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          URL<0..2^16-1>; 
        opaque          logo<0..2^16-1>; 
     } InstanceDescription; 
      
     struct { 
        opaque             channel_id<0..2^16-1>;

  channel_id 
      the identifier of the channel. Unhashed ID 
      
   short_description 
     short description about the content. Normally, this is a title of 
       the content. 
    
   contents_desc 
      Descriptions and other metadata for this channel 
      
   instance_desc 
     Start,finish time, and other information of this channel 
    

   The contents descriptions and instance descriptions are inherited 
   from [TVAF]. If a user needs more information, he can use additional 
   URL in InstanceDescription. 

   * Comment : This length of element in IptvMetaFullDesc is not fixed 
   in this version of draft. The total size of RELOAD message SHOULD be 
   smaller than 16K bytes. This limitation will be acceptable for 
   IptvMetaFullDesc. 

4.6. Looking up MetaFullDesc 

   When a Viewer knows Channel-ID and he want to get more description 
   about this channel, he SHOULD send FetchReq to the overlay which Kind 
   ID is IPTV-META-FULLDESC. The viewer can receive the full description 
   about the channel in FetchAns from the overlay. The FetchAns SHOULD 
   include IptvMetaFullDesc as a result. 

4.7. IPTV-META-FULLDESC Kind Definitions 

   The distributed IPTV metadata storage for the full description is 
   provided using the IPTV-META-FULLDESC Kind-ID: 

   o Kind ID - The Resource name for the IPTV-META-FULLDESC is Channel 
      ID.  

   o Data Model - The data model for the IPTV-META-FULLDESC is 
      dictionary. There MAY be many records with the same Resource-ID. 
      The dictionary key is the Channel-ID. A Peer can distinguish 
      stored items with Channel-ID. The data structure for IPTV-META-
      FULLDESC is IptvMetaFullDesc

   o Access Control - If certificate-based access control is being used, 
      stored data of Kind-ID IPTV-META-FULLDESC must be signed by 
      certificate which contains Channel-ID matching the Channel-ID in 
      IptvMetaFullDesc structure. 

5. Channel peer list storage 

5.1. Overview 

   P2PSIP DHT can store peer list for a channel. The responsible peer of 
   a certain channel ID stores all peers who are sending, relaying, or 
   receiving this channel. This is very similar to Tracker based 
   architecture that is described in Section 3.1. The Content Provider 
   registers the Channel-ID and its Peer ID to the overlay. If a peer 
   can provide media to other peer, this peer registers its Peer ID to 
   the overlay. A peer which want to watch the channel receives peer 
   list from the overlay. This list consists of a Contents Provider and 
   all peers of the channel. After the peer gets peer list, peer chooses 
   and connects best peers using a specific protocol such as PPSP[PPSP]. 
   The following figure shows the overview of Channel peer list storage.

   Peer A is a Content Provider. Peer A sends StoreReq to register new 
   channel and its Peer ID. This StoreReq includes Channel ID (Ch#9) and 
   A's Peer ID 1111. The resource name of this is Channel ID. 

   If Peer B wants to watch Ch#9 channel, Peer B sends FetchReq into the 
   overlay. The overlay replies with FetchAns. This FetchAns includes 
   the peer list. The peer list includes Peer ID 1111 now. Peer B sends 
   AttachReq to Peer ID 1111. This message has Peer B's ICE candidates 
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice]. This message will be arrived at Peer A. Peer A 
   replies with AttachAns message that includes Peer A's ICE candidates. 
   After that, Peer A and Peer B will perform ICE check and make a 
   connection. Peer B may ask Peer A to send media using a certain media 
   signaling protocol. This protocol is not P2PSIP protocol. This 
   protocol can be PPSP or SIP. After Peer B can relay this channel, 
   Peer B sends StoreReq to register Peer B's Peer ID into the peer list 
   for Ch#9 Channel. 

   Peer C also does the same process to Peer B. The response, FetchAns, 
   has two peer IDs that are 1111 and 2222. Peer C attaches Peer B and 
   Peer A. Peer C may choose the best peer between Peer A and Peer B 
   using a certain media signaling protocol. Peer C can get more 
   information about peers by communicating with other peers. After Peer 
   C is ready to relay the media to another peer, Peer C register its 
   Peer ID 3333 into the peer list for this Ch#9 channel by sending 
   StoreReq. 

5.2. Registering channel peer list 

   To register a channel peer ID, StoreReq message SHOULD include 
   IptvChanPeerList structure. Normally, StoreReq include only one Peer 
   ID in IptvChanPeerList structure. But, it is possible to use more 
   than one Peer ID in IptvChanPeerList in StoreReq. The Kind ID of this 
   storing data is IPTV-CHAN-PEER-LIST. 

   The contents of IptvChanPeer structure are defined as follows: 

     struct { 
        Destination     peer_id 
      opaque         location_info<0..2^16-1>; 
     } IptvPeerInfo; 
      
     struct { 
        uint32         peer_list_length; 
      IptvPeerInfo     peer_list[peer_list_length]; 
     } IptvChanPeer; 
      
   The contents of the IptvChanPeer PDU are:

Internet-Draft            RELOAD IPTV Usage               October 2009 
    

      
     peer_id - the identifier of peers of this channel. 
      
     location_info - this peer's virtual position. peer can get this 
         position from network coordinate system[GNP], ISP(AS) number, 
         or IP address based mapping. ISP number can be worked with ALTO 
         service[RFC5693]. Peer MAY user this location information to 
         select the best peer.  
     * Comment : The format of location_info is not fixed yet. 
      
     peer_list_length - the number of the peers in the list. 
      
     peer_list - the list of IptvPeerInfo. 
        

5.3. Looking up channel peer list 

   To get channel peer list of a channel, FetchAns message SHOULD 
   include IptvChanPeerList structure. The responsible peer replies with 
   all peer list. 

5.4. IPTV-CHAN-PEER-LIST Kind Definition 

   The distributed IPTV channel peer list storage is provided using the 
   IPTV-CHAN-PEER-LIST Kind-ID: 

   o Kind ID - The Resource name for the IPTV-CHAN-PEER-LIST is Channel 
      ID.  

   o Data Model - The data model for the IPTV-CHAN-PEER-LIST is 
      dictionary. The dictionary key is the Peer-ID.  

   o Access Control - If certificate-based access control is being used, 
      stored data of Kind-ID IPTV-CHAN-PEER-LIST must be signed by 
      certificate which contains Peer-ID matching the Peer-ID in 
      IptvChanPeerList structure. 

    

6. Active storage & Channel peer group storage 

6.1. Active Storage & Overview 

   The existing P2PSIP RELOAD supports passive storage only. The 
   responsible peer SHOULD store a requested data without any change. 
   The response also SHOULD be the same to what was stored. The 
   responsible peer SHOULD NOT re-arrange, modify, or select the stored 
 
 
Seokkap, et al.        Expires April 24, 2010                [Page 15]

   data. The responsible peer works passively. For redundancy, the 
   stored data in the redundancy responsible peer (the successor of the 
   responsible peer) SHOULD be synchronized to it in the main 
   responsible peer. The responsible peer uses the same StoreReq that it 
   received from the requesting peer. That's why P2PSIP RELOAD is 
   passive storage. 

   To make the responsible peer more active, this document suggests an 
   active storage. In the active storage, the responsible peer has some 
   active logic. It can re-arrange, modify, or select the stored data. 
   It can store the requested data into another peer.  

   The channel peer list storage which is explained in Section 5 is not 
   scalable. It is possible that there is lots of peer in a channel. 
   Under the flash crowd, the number of peer can be more than a million. 
   It is impossible for one peer to store all peer list. Moreover, 
   RELOAD message cannot carry this huge data. 

   If the responsible peer of the channel has active logic, it can store 
   the data in another distributed manner. The responsible peer form 
   peer groups and stores grouped peer list into another peers. This 
   grouping logic SHOULD be the same to the redundancy responsible 
   peer's. This responsible peer keeps information about groups, which 
   information MAY includes group ID and the number of peer in a group. 
   This document provides virtual network coordinate based grouping 
   strategy. Every peer can get its virtual position using a network 
   coordination system or an IP address mapping. Grouping is performed 
   using peer's location, the number of peer in group, and the number of 
   group. This grouping can be performed hierarchically. We can call a 
   intermediate responsible peer a group manager. A group manager can 
   reassign groups with StoreReq(IPTV-CHAN-PEER-GROUP). 

   * Comment : The exact grouping strategy is to be defined. 

    

6.2. Registering channel peer group 

   After the responsible peer of the Channel ID receives a StoreReq with 
   IPTV-CHAN-PEER-LIST, it assigns this requesting peer to a group. The 
   responsible peer sends a StoreReq with IPTV-CHAN-PEER-GROUP to the 
   overlay. The Resource name of this message is Channel ID, group level, 
   and group ID. This message uses IptvChanPeerGroup structure. 

   The contents of a IptvChanPeerGroup are as follows:

     struct { 
        uint32         level; 
         uint32           group_id; 
         uint32          peer_list_length; 
      IptvPeerInfo     peer_list[peer_list_length]; 
     } IptvChanPeerGroup; 
      
     level - grouping level. This document supports hierarchical 
         grouping. The first level is 1. 
      
     group_id - group id in this level. peer info is stored in this 
         group. 
      
     peer_list_length - the number of the peers in the list. 
      
     peer_list - the list of IptvPeerInfo. 
      
    

   The following figure shows an example of Channel peer group storage. 

     Peer D                    Peer X                       Peer Y 
     (4444)                      |                             | 
       |                         |                             | 
       | StoreReq(Ch#9,4444) --> |                             | 
       |                  +--------------+                     | 
       |                  | assign group |                     | 
       |                  +--------------+                     | 
       |                         | StoreReq(Ch#9,L1,G3,4444)-> | 
       |                         |                             | 
    

   Peer D is new peer. Peer X is the responsible peer of this channel. 
   After Peer X receives Peer D's StoreReq, Peer X decides to assign 
   Peer D to group#3 on group level 1. And, Peer X sends StoreReq with 
   IPTV-CHAN-PEER-GROUP to Peer Y. Peer Y is the responsible peer of 
   Channel-ID plus level plus group ID. Peer Y stores the peer 
   information into this group. 

6.3. Looking up channel peer group 

   The responsible peer of the Channel ID receives FetchReq with IPTV-
   CHAN-PEER-LIST. The response, FetchAns, uses IptvChanPeerGroup. This 
   response SHOULD include all peer information list or a part of all 
   peer information in the group. The responsible peer of Channel ID MAY 
   give the requesting peer initial peer list instead of whole peer list 
   in the group.

6.4. IPTV-CHAN-PEER-GROUP Kind Definition 

   The distributed IPTV channel peer group storage is provided using the 
   IPTV-CHAN-PEER-GROUP Kind-ID: 

   o Kind ID - The format of Resource name for the IPTV-CHAN-PEER-GROUP 
      is : 

        Channel ID '+' grouping level '+' group ID 

   o Data Model - The data model for the IPTV-CHAN-PEER-GROUP is 
      dictionary. The dictionary key is the Peer-ID. 

   o Access Control - If certificate-based access control is being used, 
      stored data of Kind-ID IPTV-CHAN-PEER-GROUP must be signed by 
      certificate which contains Peer-ID matching the Peer-ID in 
      IptvChanPeerGroup structure.

                  Native IPv6 Across NAT44 CPEs (6a44)
                     draft-despres-softwire-6a44-01

Abstract

   Most CPEs should soon be dual stack, but a large installed base of
   IPv4-only CPEs is likely to remain for several years.  Also, with the
   IPv4 address shortage, more and more ISPs will assign private IPv4
   addresses to their customers.  The need for IPv6 connectivity
   therefore concerns hosts behind IPv4-only CPEs, including such CPEs
   that are assigned private addresses.  The 6a44 mechanism specified in
   this document addresses this need, without limitations and
   operational complexities of Tunnel Brokers and Teredo to do the same.

   6a44 is based on an address mapping and on a mechanism whereby
   suitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain IPv6 connectivity via
   a stateless 6a44 server function operated by their Internet Service
   Provider.  With it, IPv6 traffic between two 6a44 hosts in a single
   site remains within the site.  Except for IANA numbers that remain to
   be assigned, the specification is intended to be complete enough for
   running codes to be independently written and interwork.

Internet-Draft    Native IPv6 behind NAT44 CPEs (6a44)      October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Most CPEs (customer premise equipments) should soon be dual stack,
   but a large installed base of IPv4-only CPEs is likely to remain for
   several years.  Also, with the IPv4 address shortage, more and more
   Internet service providers (ISPs) will assign private IPv4 addresses
   of [RFC1918] to their customers.  The need for IPv6 connectivity
   therefore includes hosts behind IPv4-only CPEs, including such CPEs
   that have private addresses.

   At the moment, there are two traversal techniques to address this
   need:

   1.  A configured tunnel (IPv6 in IPv4 or even IPv6 in UDP), involving
       a managed tunnel broker, e.g.  [RFC3053], with which the user
       must register.  Well known examples include deployments of the
       Hexago tool, and the SixXs collaboration.  However, this approach
       does not scale well; it requires significant support effort and
       is really only suitable for "hobbyist" early adopters of IPv6.

   2.  Teredo [RFC4380].  This is an automatic UDP-based tunneling
       solution that relies on a Teredo server, and on Teredo relays
       willing to carry the traffic.  Unfortunately experience shows
       that this is sometimes an unreliable process in practice, with
       clients sometimes believing that they have Teredo connectivity
       when in fact they don't, or alternatively with the Teredo server
       and relay being very remote from the client and causing extremely
       long latency for IPv6 packets.  This leads to user frustration
       and even to advice from help desks to disable IPv6.

   6a44 is based on an address mapping and on a mechanism whereby
   suitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain IPv6 connectivity via
   a stateless 6a44 server function operated by their Internet Service
   Provider.

   To address this need without the mentioned limitations, 6a44 is based
   on an address mapping and on a mechanism whereby suitably upgraded
   hosts behind a NAT may obtain IPv6 connectivity via a stateless 6a44
   server function operated by their ISP.  It can apply even with ISPs
   that, due to the IPv4 address shortage, assign private addresses of
   [RFC1918] to their IPv4 customers (typically with prefix 10.0.0.0/8).

   6a44 is only a transition technology.  It will no longer have to be
   used when the number of IPv4-only CPEs becomes negligible.

   Except for IANA numbers that remain to be assigned, the specification
   is intended to be complete enough for running codes to be
   independently written and interwork.

2.  Applicability

   Both hosts and ISPs can be made 6a44 capable independently of each
   other, with 6a44 being actually used by 6a44 capable hosts where
   their local ISPs are 6a44-capable.

   For a host to be 6a44 capable, it has to support the 6a44 Client
   function ("6a44-C" in some Figures).  This function is placed in its
   TCP/IP stack at the same place as the 6to4 router function of
   [RFC3056]: it has an IPv4 interface in its link-layer direction and
   both an IPv4 interface and an IPv6 pseudo-interface in its higher
   layers direction.

   To enable its 6a44 function, a host must have no intra-site NAT44
   between itself and the site CPE.  (In sites where there are intra-
   site NAT44s, these NATs should be configured so that hosts behind
   them cannot enable 6a44.  In view of the specification below, it can
   be done with a port mapping in each of them between the well-known
   port of 6a44 and an internal private address that DHCP doesn't
   assign.)  In addition, the host must have in IPv4 a link MTU of at
   least 1308 octets (the MTU to be guaranteed in IPv6 plus the length
   of an UDP/IPv4 encapsulation header).

   For an IPv4 ISP network to be 6a44 capable, the ISP must operate the
   6a44 Server function, ("6a44-S" in some Figures).  This function is
   anywhere at its border between the IPv4 network and an IPv6 network
   in which it has a /48 prefix.  Typically this prefix will be chosen
   from whatever shorter PA prefix has been allocated to the ISP.  The
   6a44 server function can be replicated in any number of routers,
   known as "6a44 Relays", to enhance service quality and service
   availability.  Also, the network must have an IPv4 MTU of at least
   1308 octets and, for security, must support the ingress filtering of
   [RFC3704] (see Section 7).

                                 Figure 1

   Each ISP can support one public-addressing and several private-
   addressing 6a44 networks.

   In 6a44 networks, ISPs may route IPv6 in addition to IPv4.  Where
   this is the case, 6a44 only concerns CPEs that are IPv4-only capable.
   If on the contrary IPv4 is the only routed address family, 6a44 may
   also concerns sites where CPEs are dual-stack capable.  Unable to
   take advantage of their IPv6 capability, they act as if they would be
   IPv4-only.

   Figure 1 illustrates ISP-network configurations on which 6a44 can be
   used.

   NOTE: The objective of 6a44 differs from that of Teredo ([RFC4380]
   and [RFC5991]).  Teredo has been designed to avoid needing any ISP
   participation.  This has permitted early deployment but didn't ensure
   connectivity between all Teredo addresses and all native IPv6
   addresses.  Also, it imposed a very significant level of complexity.
   On the contrary, 6a44 is designed to be explicitly supported by ISPs.
   As a result, connectivity between 6a44 IPv6 addresses and all native
   IPv6 addresses can be ensured, and implementations can remain simple.

   The 6a44 IPv6 address an ISP assigns to a host must first contain all
   what is needed to reach it from the IPv6 backbone.  This includes, as
   illustrated in Figure 2:

   o  the IPv6 prefix D that the ISP has assigned border routers of its
      6a44 network;

   o  the IPv4 address N of the customer site (external address of the
      NAT44 in its CPE);

   o  the port Z that, in the CPE NAT44 CPE, has to be used to reach the
      host at its address address A, and in the host the 6a44 well-known
      port W (to be assigned by IANA).

   To ensure that two 6a44 hosts behind the same IPv4-only CPE exchange
   packets without entering the ISP network, the 6a44 address of each
   host must also contain its IPv4 address A.

   The format of 6a44 IPv6 addresses, a concatenation of D,N,Z, and A,
   where D has to be a /48 prefix, is detailed in Figure 2.

   NOTE: Since IPv6 prefixes D assigned by ISPs to their customers
   always start with 001, the prefix of all IPv6 Aggregatable Global
   Unicast addresses specified in [RFC2374], 6a44 IPv6 addresses bend
   the rule of [RFC4291] that says 'for all unicast addresses, except
   those that start with binary value 000, Interface IDs are required to
   be 64 bits long and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64 format".
   This is however acceptable in practice because 6a44 addresses are
   never used on any real IPv6 link, and in particular never subject to
   the neighbor discovery protocol of [RFC2461] which depends on
   properties of interface IDs.  A revision of the [RFC4291] sentence
   should eventually clarify this point.

4.  Address Mappings and Encapsulations

   Figure 3 and Figure 4 detail the address mappings and encapsulations/
   decapsulations to be performed by 6a44 Client and server functions
   respectively, with the following notation:

   o  (vX,A1,A2,data): a packet of the IPvX version that has A1 as
      source address, A2 as destination address, and "data" as payload.
      (UDP,P1,P2,data): a UDP IP payload that has P1 as source port, P2
      as destination port, and "data" as payload.

   o  B is the 6a44 well-known anycast address, that of the 6a44 Server
      function.  X...: an address that starts with prefix X.

   o  not X: an address different from X

   o  X.Y: the concatenation of X and Y (the dot is the concatenation
      operator).

   For protection against spoofing attacks, decapsulating functions must
   check consistency of IPv6 addresses fields with IPv4 addresses and
   UDP ports of encapsulating headers, both for source and destination
   addresses.

   Figures present only one direction of 6a44-function traversals, but
   mappings that apply to the reverse direction are the same, with just
   a permutation of source and destination fields, for all of IPv4,
   IPv6, and UDP.  Mappings and encapsulations/decapsulations for the
   reverse direction of that presented in Figures are the same, but with
   with source and destination permuted in IPv6, IPv4 and UDP.

   Recommendations of [RFC4213] that concern these encapsulations have
   to be followed.

5.  MTU considerations

   Reassembly of multi-fragment datagrams needs stateful processing, and
   opens the door to some denial of service attacks.  To ensure a
   freedom of distribution of 6a44 Server functions in any number of
   parallel processors anywhere in 6a44 ISP networks, it has therefore
   to be avoided.

   For this:

   o  6a44 ISP networks must have internal IPv4 MTUs of at least 1308
      octets (which is easy to ensure).

   o  6a44 hosts must limit to 1280 octets IPv6 packets they transmit to
      destinations that are not neighbors on their own links.  This
      behavior is already the normal one as long as no other IPv6 path
      MTU has been reliably discovered.

   o  6a44 Server functions refuse packets received from their IPv6
      pseudo interfaces if their sizes exceed 1280 octets, with ICMPv6
      Packet Too Big messages returned to sources as required by
      [RFC2460].)

   In a host, a destination is considered to be an on link neighbor if
   the IPv6 destination has the same bits 0-79 as the host address, and
   if the IPv4 destination starts with the prefix of the IPv4 link of
   the host.  In this case, the IPv6 path MTU can be taken as that of
   the IPv4 link MTU minus 28 octets (a value that is typically
   significantly longer that 1280 octets).


6.  Host Acquisition of IPv6 Addresses and their Lifetimes

   Acquisition of 6a44 addresses by hosts is independent from other
   mechanisms they may have to acquire other IPv6 addresses (PPP, DHCP,
   SLAAC, ...).  It only depends on 6a44 packet exchanges between hosts
   and 6a44 Relays.

   In order to acquire 6a44 addresses, hosts transmit IPv6 Address
   Request messages to 6a44 Server functions and expect IPv6 Address
   Indication messages in return.

   Formats of these 6a44 messages are shown in Figure 5.  They start
   with a 6a44 mark, a null octet chosen so that, in payloads of UDP
   datagrams received by 6a44 Client and 6a44 Server functions, 6a44
   messages can be distinguished from IPv6 packets (IPv6 packets always
   have a non-null first octet).

   In a host, the 6a44 Client function should be activated for one of
   its physical interfaces only if this interface has a private IPv4
   address and no other native IPv6 address.  (An address is said to be
   native if it starts with 2000::/3 (global unicast) and neither with
   2002::/16 (the 6to4 prefix) nor with 2001::/32 (the Teredo prefix).)

   Message processing in a 6a44 Client function consists in transmitting
   from time to time IPv6 Address Requests to the 6a44 Server function,
   and to update the host IPv6 address and its lifetime each time an
   IPv6 Address Indication message is received (with due IPv4 source
   address verification for security).

   In order to decide when to transmit such a message, the 6a44 Client
   function has the equivalent of the following states:

   "Waiting for an IPv6 Address Indication":  When this state is
      entered, an IPv6 Address Request is transmitted, a Response
      Awaited timer of 1 second is started, and a Retransmission Count
      is set to 0.  If the timer expires with a Retransmission Count
      less than 10, a new IPv6 Address Request is transmitted, and the
      count is increased by 1.  If it expires with a count equal to 10,
      the state is changed to "waiting before a new attempt to find a
      6a44 service".  If an IPv6 Address Indication is received while in
      this state, the timer is stopped, the state is changed to "Waiting
      for having to refresh the NAT-binding".  This state is also re-
      entered each time a new IPv4 address is assigned to the link-
      direction interface of the 6a44 Client function.

   "Waiting for having to refresh the NAT-binding":  When this state is
      entered, a timer of 29 second is started.(This value is that
      chosen for SIP in [RFC5626] for the same objective, i.e. to
      maintain tunnel NAT bindings without particular knowledge about
      NAT specifics.)  This timer is restarted each time an IPv6 packet
      is transmitted to the 6a44 Server function (not when a packet is
      transmitted host to host within the customer site).  It is also
      restarted if an IPv6 Address Indication is received while in this
      state.  (This may happen in particular if the NAT binding has
      changed, e.g. because CPE reset during the lifetime of the IPv6
      address.)  If the timer expires, the state is changed to "Waiting
      for an IPv6 Address Indication".

   "waiting before a new attempt to find a 6a44 service":  When this
      state is entered, a 6a44 Availability timer of 1 hour is started.
      When it expires, the state is changed to "Waiting for an IPv6
      Address Indication".

7.  Security considerations

   Traffic-capture attack by a neighbor:   If it would be possible to
      transmit from a neighboring site a bogus address indication to a
      6a44 host, this host could inadvertently advertise an IPv6 address
      that is not his real 6a44 address.  Some incoming connections that
      it should have received could then be redirected to a wrong
      address.  However, because 6a44 is applicable only to ISP networks
      that support the ingress filtering of [RFC3704] (see Section 2),
      no neighbor can fake a valid Address Indication message (the IPv4
      source of packets it sends cannot be the 6a44 well-known IPv4
      address, the only valid source for an Address Indication message).

   Spoofing attacks:   With address checks of Section 4, 6a44 should
      introduce no spoofing vulnerabilities beyond those the underlying
      IPv4 networks may have.  ISPs that use subscriber authentications
      to secure IPv4 address assignments have the effect of this
      authentication automatically extended to 6a44 addresses (they
      include the assigned IPv4 addresses).

   Denial-of-service attacks:   Provided 6a44 Server functions are
      provisioned with enough processing power, which is facilitated by
      their being stateless, 6a44 is expected to introduce no denial of
      service vulnerabilities of its own.

   Subscriber authentication:   This is not provided as part of 6a44,
      because it is assumed to have occurred when the IPv4 address
      assignment was made.

   Routing-loop attacks:   A risk of routing-loop attacks has been
      identified for some encapsulation/decapsulation mechanisms
      [draft-ietf-v6ops-tunnel-loops-00].  It doesn't exist with 6a44
      because:

      *  IPv4 packets entering a 6a44 Server function are not forwarded
         if they come from another instance of the 6a44 Server function
         itself, i.e. if the IPv4 source is the 6a44 well-known IPv4
         address Section 4.

      *  The encapsulation header, which is based on UDP with a specific
         well-known port, cannot be confused with that of other
         encapsulation mechanisms (in particular those of IP in IP like
         those of 6to4, 6rd and ISATAP).

Internet-Draft    Native IPv6 behind NAT44 CPEs (6a44)      October 2010


   Missing 6a44 Server function:   If a 6a44-capable host is client of
      an ISP that doesn't support 6a44, 6a44 IPv6 Address Request
      messages transmitted by the host will be forwarded to the Internet
      backbone, with the 6a44 well-known IPv4 address as destination.
      Since this address doesn't start with any prefix that the backbone
      routes toward ISP networks, these messages will be discarded
      before reaching any place where a fake 6a44 Server could have been
      malevolently placed.  There is therefore no danger that 6a44 hosts
      could have their IPv6 traffic routed via 6a44 Server functions
      that would not belong to their local ISP (i.e. where they could be
      observed and acted upon without control).


8.  IANA Considerations

   For 6a44 to be used, both its IPv4 well-known address B and its well-
   known port W need to be assigned by IANA.

   This assignment is necessary to validate the plug-an-play operation
   of 6a44 with independent implementations.  Having it as quickly as
   possible (i.e. without waiting for all details of the specification
   to be agreed on), would be helpful for an early validation of the
   6a44 plug-and-play operation.

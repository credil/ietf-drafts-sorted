Abstract

   This document describes procedures on providing optimal routing for
   IPv4 Internet traffic based on the shortest IGP metric.  It builds on
   the ability of advertising multiple paths for a given destination
   prefix, using BGP Add-Path and provides a solution for selectively
   indicating preferences towards BGP path(s) via affinities.

Internet-Draft        BGP Optimal Route Reflection             June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes applications and carrier Internet routing
   requirements that can be fulfilled by using BGP [RFC4271] Add-Path
   [I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths], and proposes a mechanism to use affinities
   with the BGP protocol to influence path selection.


2.  Terminology

      network

3.  Problem Statement: Ensuring Closest Exit Routing

   Carriers have diverse deployments of peering points, which may not
   reflect the network hierarchy.  For instance major POPs, which form
   the core of the network hierarchy may not be the only POPs to have
   Internet peering/transit points.  It is common for POPs further down
   the network hierarchy (minor POPs) to also have Internet peering/
   transit arrangements.

   A very common requirement is to offer closest exit routing for
   Internet traffic.  In other words traffic originating from POP-A
   should always use the local ASBR (if there is a viable path available
   locally).  We make the assumption that complete Internet routing
   information is available at every ASBR.  If the local ASBR does not

   have reachibility to the relevant prefixes (or the ASBR itself is not
   available), traffic should use the closest (in terms of IGP metric)
   egress.  This is typically known as "hot potato routing".

   In order to ensure the required behavior, a design as follows is
   commonly deployed:

   The dotted lines denote both the physical connections between
   devices, as well as the BGP RR Client to RR peering sessions.

           ,---.  /  | ( PEA  ).....P-Core ... ASBR1 )  |     \  ,---.

         (  CE   |   |          .|          |  .        |      ( AS XYZ)

                     +-----------+          +-----------+

   In the illustration above, each ASBR advertises its available
   prefixes to each of the core (Provider) routers.  Each of the P
   routers acts as a route reflector for all of the PE routers in a
   given POP.  This generally ensures that for any given prefix each PE
   router will pick a path via the local ASBR(s).

   We note two problems with this design:

   First, core routers carry BGP, and this hinders operators eager to
   deploy a purely label switched, BGP free core for all traffic types
   and applications.

   Second, some address families (e.g.  VPNv4, MVPNv4, etc) may be
   deployed using dedicated route reflectors located at strategic
   locations (major POPs for instance).  If IPv4 Internet route
   reflection is distributed to each P router in each POP as described
   above, the challenge is to provide a transition plan to overcome the
   first problem (achieve a BGP free core) and also move to a
   consolidated scheme of route reflector deployment such as is used by
   other address families.

3.1.  BGP Add-Path to offer Closest Exit Routing

   In the near term not all devices in the network will support BGP Add-
   Path.  This is because relatively smaller/legacy hardware may not
   have the scale to support multiple paths for a given prefix, or it is
   just not planned to be supported.  Therefore carriers may deploy

   alternate models - as illustrated in the following sections, to
   achieve the following:

      Can help a carrier remove BGP from its core routers, and make way
      for a purely label switched core for IPv4 Internet traffic, and

      Can help the carrier deploy Add-Path in a phased manner, without
      altering traffic patterns.

   In order to address the issue of removing BGP from the P routers, the
   BGP client-RR peering sessions which were originally between the PE
   and P routers may be shifted from the P routers to the ASBR(s).
   Therefore an ASBR may now perform the role of Route Reflector for all
   of its locally connected PE routers (i.e within the same POP).  The P
   routers are relieved of this role.

                     +-----------+==========+-----------+


   The "==" lines indicate that the client to RR sessions that were
   originally between the PE and P routers are shifted to be between the
   PE and ASBR(s) layers.

   We note that ASBRs will generally have a large RIB/FIB capacity, due
   to the fact that they may connect to more than one upstream
   provider/AS.  Therefore resource constraints will be less likely to
   hinder adoption of Add-Path on such systems.

   Carriers normally utilize centralized RRs, placed at strategic
   locations of their choice, for consolidation of iBGP sessions from
   the ASBRs.  Therefore each ASBR would normally peer with one or more
   dedicated/central RRs for BGP route propagation between each ASBR.
   It is to be noted that both the RR and ASBRs need to support the
   adoption of BGP Add-Path.

   Each ASBR will now receive multiple paths for a given destination
   prefix, due to the adoption of Add-Path.  The ASBRs would now perform
   the best path selection for a given prefix, which would ideally
   result in the local path received i.e. the path received from an
   external peer - to be preferred over paths received from other ASBRs
   within the carrier network.  It is this path, which would be
   advertised to the PE routers within a local POP or region - that are
   peered with a given ASBR.

   This scheme of deployment provides a means of extending BGP Add-Path
   to the entire network, in a seamless and phased manner, while at the
   same time providing carriers the means to achieve closest exit
   routing, and deploy a BGP free core (which was the only means of
   achieving such routing requirements without Add-Path).

   Eventually a carrier may be able to consolidate all iBGP sessions on
   a centralized RR, based on the adoption of Add-Path on PEs.  This
   could relieve the ASBR of route reflection responsibilities.

   Extending BGP Add-Path in a phased manner to PE devices that support
   this feature also improves convergence and reduces churn in the event
   of a preferred path for a given prefix being unavailable, since
   multiple paths are available on the PE and the decision process can
   now be re-run on the PE itself.


4.  Service POPs

   Carriers need to deploy services (for example, DNS, RADIUS, etc) with
   N+M resiliency with a view of offering high availability, geo
   resiliency and load sharing to scale the solution horizontally.
   Given such requirements an anycast routing approach may seem to be
   favorable.  A virtual address or set of addresses for each
   application may be advertised via BGP from every service POP.  The
   advantage of using BGP is that PE routers can learn BGP paths to each
   service POP and have a local policy based on affinity or other design
   to load-share and provide resilience.

   However the downside of this approach is that all PE routers are
   required to have a mesh of BGP sessions to all service POPs in
   addition to the existing iBGP sessions with RRs and other eBGP
   sessions.  PEs at a service POP also need to support a large number
   of BGP sessions (linear in the number of PEs in the network under
   consideration).  Illustrated below:

   Above we have three service POPs, and 10 PE routers.  This would
   demand that each PE router has an iBGP session to each of the Service
   POPs, which may be highly undesirable.

   Operationally this implies that any POP commissioning or de-
   commissioning activity involves multiple touch points on the network
   and additional change control processes need to be invoked as

   business critical services are located behind PEs in service POPs.
   This also increases the risk to other services by nature of change
   enforced at multiple points.

   In the event of Add-Path being incrementally supported on PE devices,
   BGP Add-Path can be effectively used in these solutions as the RR
   completely decouples itself from the path selection process and PE
   routers are presented with all available paths to service POPs.  No
   additional BGP sessions are needed other than the existing iBGP
   sessions with RRs.

   A second benefit is that the number of configuration touches required
   in order to take a service offline is reduced.  For example, this can
   be accomplished by means of signalling a community (or other
   attribute) by the relevant service PE.  Although this can be done
   today in a full mesh, all PEs receiving the signaled route must have
   coherent BGP policies, which can present operational challenges.  By
   contrast, in the proposed scheme, only the RRs directly serving the
   service PE need to be considered.  We also observe that current
   practice of taking an entire service POP off-line by manipulating IGP
   metrics may not always be feasible if multiple services/applications
   are offered from this POP.

   In sum this approach allows carriers to operate services in a very
   low touch mode where chances of collateral damage are minimized,
   policy enforcement is made simpler and demands are eased on
   operational processes and resources.


5.  Scalability with Add-Path

   One of the concerns in accepting all paths for a given prefix is
   scalability.  For instance if there are 5 given paths for a prefix -
   Add-Path would ensure that all paths are accepted by the PE routers,
   and this is likely to pose scalability concerns with regard to
   whether the PE router can indeed accept that many BGP paths.  Further
   if a given PE router is accepting full internet tables, not every
   hardware installed in the network may have the capacity to handle
   this.

   Therefore the requirements here can be defined as following:

      Firstly each BGP speaker should have the ability to indicate the
      maximum number of paths that are acceptable for a given prefix.
      This can be configurable on the PE or/and the RR within the
      context of a BGP peer-group.





Lavallee, et al.        Expires December 6, 2011                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        BGP Optimal Route Reflection             June 2011


      Secondly each PE router should have the ability to receive the
      "best-path" to given destination prefix based on the closest ASBR,
      that is defined by the shortest IGP metric, in order to avoid "Hot
      Potato routing".

5.1.  Announcing a user defined number of BGP Paths

   Having a limited number of paths being announced via Add-Path may
   well result in the "best-path" not being announced to a given PE.
   For instance if RR1 receives 5 paths for Prefix "A", and if PE1 is
   configured to only accept 2 paths for any given prefix - then PE1
   will receive 2 paths for prefix "A" which would be based on the best
   path calculation from the viewpoint of RR1.  In other words each PE
   will receive random paths from the RR, based on the RRs view of each
   path which it considers the best and not the ones which would ideally
   be preferred by the PE.  So even though we have solved the issue of
   scalability, the bigger issue of choosing the closest ASBR based on
   IGP metric on each PE still remains.  This is addressed in the
   following sections.

5.2.  Announcing the Best path

   The objective here is to ensure that the "best path" based on the
   shortest IGP metric from each PE to an ASBR is announced by the RR.
   In other words if a PE indicates its preference to receive only 2
   paths for every prefix, from the RR - the RR should ensure that one
   of these two paths announced includes the path announced by an ASBR
   that is closest to this PE (based on the IGP metric).

   In order to achieve this, Route Targets with RT Constrain [RFC4684]
   for IPv4 prefixes are proposed.  In other words a BGP speaker will
   have the ability to advertise all of its prefixes using an Route
   Target, while announcing this to a Route Reflector or an External BGP
   session.

   RT usage in an IPv4 environment would be similar to the standard
   model used in BGP/MPLS VPNs, where each prefix may have one or more
   of this extended community attached to it.  The purpose is to
   identify prefixes and paths with certain Route Targets and have them
   advertised.  To further illustrate this from a real life deployment
   standpoint, A single RT may be used on a per POP/Region - depending
   on the operator's preference.  The RT may be used to indicate the
   group to which all BGP speakers belong to, and can be used as an
   identifier to refer to a given POP or region.  For instance all BGP
   speakers within a POP located at Frankfurt can use an RT of "X",
   whilst BGP speakers in New York can use RT "Y".

   Route Targets in the context of IPv4 would not demarcate the network



Lavallee, et al.        Expires December 6, 2011               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        BGP Optimal Route Reflection             June 2011


   into various boundaries, and only intends to serve merely as a
   mechanism to indicate a preference for certain BGP paths.  Let us
   assume that there are three ASBRs in a given network; ASBR1 is
   located in Frankfurt, ASBR2 is located in New York, and ASBR3 is
   located in Tokyo.  Now when Add-Path is used, all 3 paths would be
   announced to each PE in all the locations.  Let us assume that each
   PE is configured to receive only 2 paths instead of all 3.  In this
   case RT Constrain may be used to instruct the RR to announce a set of
   paths that match the RT Membership NLRI.

   For instance, if all PEs and ASBRs in Tokyo are configured to
   advertise all prefixes with a RT called "X:1", PEs and ASBRs in New
   York configured as "X:2", PEs in London are configured for "X:3"and
   so on - Let us say that the PE routers in Tokyo intend to only
   receive the local ASBR paths, and the same applies to the PE routers
   in New York and London.  Each PE can use the RT Membership NLRI (via
   RT Constrain) to only signal interest in the respective Route Targets
   and receive only BGP paths from their local ASBR.

   The use of Route Targets within the context of IPv4 does not change
   the 32 bit IPv4 prefix structure, and also does not mandate the need
   of any additional information to be contained within the prefix
   itself.  Route Targets would be advertised as IPv4 BGP extended
   communities.

   It is also proposed that the RR may have the ability to restrict the
   number of paths on a per RT basis towards each BGP speaker.  This
   will ensure that a given speaker may be configured to receive a only
   a given number of paths per RT - wherein each RT may correspond to
   one or more ASBRs.  This will ensure that not all paths are announced
   to a PE that only needs "N" paths.  If a given path within the
   context of an RT is withdrawn - then an alternate path (if exists)
   with the same RT would need to be advertised to the concerned PE.

5.3.  Use of Route Targets and ASBRs

   Let us look at a scenario on how the use of Route Targets impacts
   route announcements to ASBRs.  Referring back to the example in the
   previous section - using the example of three POPs in New York,
   London, and Tokyo - we may prefer that each ASBR in the network
   receives prefixes and paths for each prefix from every ASBR in the
   network.  Therefore it is fair to assume that none of the ASBR's
   would ever be configured to restrict the maximum number of paths that
   it can accept.  Therefore a "Default RT" may be advertised by each
   ASBR.  The default RT instructs the RR to announce all paths/prefixes
   to ASBRs.  So each of the three ASBRs would receive all the paths
   announced by the others.  However this does not restrict the option
   of configuring an ASBR to only receive a given number of paths.



Lavallee, et al.        Expires December 6, 2011               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        BGP Optimal Route Reflection             June 2011


   It is to be noted that the "Default RT" indicates that all prefixes/
   paths even without a corresponding RT will be considered as
   candidates for announcements.

5.4.  Use of Route Targets  and ASBRs with limited routes

   Let us look at a case where a POPs in the network has an ASBR with
   only limited number of Internet routes, for instance 1000 IPv4
   Internet Prefixes.  So let us say, this POP located is located in
   Munich, and its scope is to provide transit to only a given number of
   prefixes that are announced by a content provider.

   In this scenario, all PEs in the Munich POP may be configured to use
   the same Route Targets used by a POP that has ASBRS with full routes
   (Let us say Frankfurt, which has an ASBR with full Internet routes)
   and just indicate interest in the single common RT via an RT
   membership NLRI.  It is also possible to for the BGP speakers in
   Munich to use an independent RT which is common for the POP, and
   signal interest in the local prefixes/paths in addition to the
   Frankfurt Prefixes/Paths using RT Constrain.

5.5.  Operational Scalability with the use of Route Targets

   Let us consider a scenario where, a BGP speaker is interested in
   multiple RTs.  The proposal suggests that any implementation should
   have the ability for a given BGP speakers to use a range of RT values
   and Wildcards to signal affinities.  For example a range as follows
   indicates that the RT Membership NLRI includes RT values of [1-20,
   30-35, 50].  This avoids the need for configuring each RT value
   individually.

   A second consideration is for a PE to receive all paths announced by
   a set of ASBRs - indicated by a list of RTs (let us say "X:Y, X:Z",
   and have the RR calculated best path for all the remaining prefixes
   ir-respective of whether they have any RTs attached or not.  Going
   back to the example of the Munich POP which only had a local ASBR
   with 1000 prefixes, it may be important for the operator to just
   ensure that all local ASBR paths are available in the local PEs -
   whilst all other paths/prefixes may follow the best path calculated
   by the RR.

   In this it is proposed that each RR in the network can be configured
   with a unique RT.  For instance RR1 may be configured with RT A:B,
   while RR2 is configured with with A:C. Each BGP speaker by virtue of
   signalling the RT configured on each RR (A:B, A:C) via RT Constrain
   instructs the RR to only announce the best path for all prefixes with
   or without Route Targets.  This way each BGP speaker can choose which
   RR it intends to receive the best path from, and which RR it may

   choose to receive paths for specific Route Targets.  This provides
   the needed flexibility for an operator.

5.6.  Use of Route Targets and POPs with no ASBR

   In the scenario where a given POP does not have any local ASBRs, all
   PEs could just use RT Membership NLRI to indicate the preference of
   paths they would like to receive.

5.7.  Behaviour without RT configuration

   RT advertisement and RT membership NLRI used to signal RT constrain
   are two different aspects.  For instance an ASBR may not attach an RT
   to any of its announcements, but can still indicate its preference by
   using a list of RTs that it is interested in (via Route Constrain).
   Similarly an ASBR can advertise all its prefixes with an RT of "X:Y"
   for example, and indicate a Default RT Membership NLRI, to receive
   all paths/prefixes.

5.8.  Difference between Default RT and RT configured on RR for Best
      Path announcements

   The Default RT ensures that all paths/prefixes in the network, ir-
   respective of whether an RT is attached or not - is advertised to a
   given BGP speaker by the RR.  It is possible to configure the maximum
   no. of paths that will be advertised to BGP speakers via the Default
   RT.On the contrary, RT configured on the RR instructs the RR to send
   only the best path for prefixes (prefixes may have RTs attached or
   even may not).

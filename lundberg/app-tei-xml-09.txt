Internet-Draft     The 'application/tei+xml' mediatype     November 2010


1.  Introduction

   Text Encoding and Interchange (TEI) is an international and
   interdisciplinary standard that is widely used by libraries, museums,
   publishers, and individual scholars to represent all kinds of textual
   material for online research and teaching.[TEI]

   This document defines the 'application/tei+xml' media type in
   accordance with [RFC3023] in order enable generic processing of such
   documents on the Internet using eXtensible Markup Language
   (XML)[W3C.REC-xml-20081126] technologies.

2.  Recognizing TEI files

   TEI files are XML documents or fragments having the root element (as
   defined in [W3C.REC-xml-20081126]) in a TEI namespace.  TEI namespace
   names are defined as an Universal Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986]
   in accordance with [W3C.REC-xml-names-20091208] and begins with
   http://www.tei-c.org/ns/ followed by the version number of the
   namespace.  The current namespace is http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0

   The most common root element names for TEI documents are

      <TEI>

      <teiCorpus>

   The teiCorpus documents give the possibility to bundle multiple
   documents into a single file.

   Examples:

      A document having <TEI> root element

               <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
               <TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
                  <teiHeader>
                  ...
                  </teiHeader>
                  <text>
                  ...
                  </text>
               </TEI>

      A document having <teiCorpus> root element

               <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
               <teiCorpus  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
                  <teiHeader>
                  ...
                  </teiHeader>
                  <TEI>
                     <teiHeader>
                     ...
                     </teiHeader>
                     <text>
                     ...
                     </text>
                  </TEI>
                  <TEI>
                  ... second document ...
                  </TEI>
                  <TEI>
                  ... third document  ...
                  </TEI>
               </teiCorpus>

   TEI and teiCorpus files are often given the extensions .tei and
   .teiCorpus, respectively.  There is a third type of file, which often
   is given the suffix .odd.  ODD ('One Document Does it All') is a TEI
   XML document which include schema fragments, prose documentation, and
   reference documentation.  It is used for the definition and
   documentation of XML based languages, and primarily for the TEI
   Guidelines.[ODD] In other words, ODD files does not differ from other
   TEI file in syntax, only in function.

3.  Fragment identifier

   Documents having the media type 'application/tei+xml', use the
   fragment identifier notation as specified in [RFC3023] for the media
   type 'application/xml'.

4.  Security considerations

   An XML resource does not in itself compromise data security.  When
   being available on a network simply through the dereferencing of an
   Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) [RFC3987] or an URI, care
   must be taken to properly interpret the data to prevent unintended
   access.  Hence the security issues of [RFC3986], section 7, apply.
   In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it shares
   the same security considerations as described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023],
   section 10.  In general, security issues related to the use of XML in
   IETF protocols are treated in RFC 3470[RFC3470], section 7.  We will
   not try to duplicate this material, but review some aspects that are
   important for document centric XML as applied to text encoding.

4.1.  Harmful content

   Any application accepting submitted or retrieving TEI XML for
   processing has to be aware of risks connected with injection of
   harmful scripts and executable XML.  XML
   inclusion[W3C.REC-xinclude-20061115] and the use of external
   entities, are vulnerable to various forms of spoofing but can also
   reveal aspects of a service in a way that may compromise its
   security.  Any vulnerability of these kinds are, however, application
   specific.  The TEI namespaces do not contain such elements.

4.2.  Intellectual Property Rights

   TEI documents often arise in digitization of cultural heritage
   materials.  Texts made accessible in TEI format may be unrestricted
   in the sense that their distribution may be unlimited by Digital
   Rights Management[DRM] or Intellectual Property Rights[IPR]
   constraints.  However, TEI documents are heterogeneous.  Some parts
   of a document may be unrestricted, whereas other, such as editorial
   text and annotations may be subject to DRM restrictions.

   The TEI format provides means for highly granular attribution, down
   to the content of individual XML elements.  Software agents
   participating in the exchange or processing TEI may be required to
   honour markup of this kind.  Even when there are no IPR constraints,
   intellectual property attribution alone requires that document users
   are able to tell the difference between content from different
   sources.

4.3.  Authenticity and confidentiality

   Historical archival records are often encoded in TEI and legal
   document may be binding centuries after they were written.
   Digitization and encoding of legal texts may require technologies for

   assuring authenticity, such as cryptographic check sums and
   electronic signatures.

   Similarly, historical documents may in part or in their entirety be
   confidential.  This may be required by law or by the terms and
   conditions such as in the case of donated or deposited text from
   private sources.  A text archive may need content filtering or
   cryptographic technologies to meet such requirements.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of MIME type 'application/tei+xml'

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: tei+xml

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: charset

         the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter
         of the "application/xml" media type as specified in RFC 3023
         [RFC3023].

      Encoding considerations:

         Identical to those for 'application/xml'.  See RFC 3023
         [RFC3023], Section 3.2.

      Security considerations:

         See Security considerations (Section 4) in this specification.

      Interoperability considerations:

         TEI documents are often given the extension '.xml', which is
         not uncommon for other XML document formats.

      Published specification:

         This media type registration is for TEI documents[TEI] as
         described in here.  TEI syntax is defined in a
         schema.[TEIschema]

      Applications which use this media type:

         There are currently no known applications using the media type
         'application/tei+xml'.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s):

            There is no single initial octet sequence that is always
            present in TEI documents.

         file extension(s):

            Common extensions are '.tei', '.teiCorpus' and '.odd'.  See
            Recognizing TEI files (Section 2) in this specification.

         Macintosh File Type Code(s)

            TEXT

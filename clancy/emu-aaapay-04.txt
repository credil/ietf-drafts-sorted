            EAP Method Support for Transporting AAA Payloads
                     draft-clancy-emu-aaapay-04.txt

Abstract

   This document defines bindings for existing EAP methods to transport
   Diameter AVPs, called "AAA payloads".  The primary application is to
   support EAP channel bindings, but this could be used for other
   applications as well.

Internet-Draft                 EAP-AAAPAY                       May 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a payload which can be securely transported by
   an Extensible Authentication Method (EAP) method [RFC3748] that
   carries arbitrary Diameter Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) [RFC3588].
   While it may seem strange for EAP to encapsulate Authorization,
   Authentication, and Accounting (AAA) messages, since AAA typically
   encapsulates EAP, the security properties are different.  In
   particular, AAA data transported by EAP between the client and server
   will be protected by an end-to-end security relationship.  This
   provides a secure channel for doing things like channel bindings
   [RFC5056].


2.  Terminology

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Overview and Requirements

   Many EAP [RFC3748] methods have extensible properties that allow you
   to embed arbitrary data within a secure channel.  This channel is
   secured using keys derived during the EAP authentication.  These
   channels vary in the properties that they provide, typically either
   providing integrity protection or both confidentiality and integrity
   protection.

   In this document we define a payload format for encapsulating
   Diameter AVPs [RFC3588], and via backwards compatability [RFC4005],
   RADIUS TLVs [RFC2865].  We provide bindings for a variety of existing
   EAP methods that would allow them to transport this data.  One
   specific application of this is to support EAP channel bindings
   [RFC5056][I-D.ietf-emu-chbind].

   The main goal is to provide the peer and server to exchange AAA
   messages protected by an end-to-end security association.  As such,
   any EAP method transporting the AAA payloads defined in this document
   MUST support integrity protection.  To accomplish this, a method
   supporting AAA payloads MUST perform mutual authentication and derive
   session keys (i.e.  MSK, etc), and during this derivation process
   MUST derive a unique, cryptographically independent, fresh key for
   protecting AAA payloads.  Protocols SHOULD also support
   confidentiality in addition to integrity protection.  Confidentiality

   is important for identity protection, as a variety of identities can
   be passed over this channel.


4.  AAA Payload Format

   This section describes the formatting for the AAA Payloads.  Each
   payload consists of the following fields:

   o  Version, 1 octet
   o  Flags, 1 octet
   o  length(Session-ID), 2 octets
   o  Session-ID [RFC5247], arbitrary length
   o  One or more Diameter AVPs [RFC3588], arbitrary length

   The version field is 1 octet.  This documents defines version 0x01.

   The flags field is 1 octet, and is the logical AND of the following
   applicable values:

   o  0x01: Validation Failed
   o  0x02: Validation Inconclusive
   o  0x04: Validation Successful

   The validation flag fields are used by the EAP server to convey the
   success of the consistency check to the EAP peer.  These flags SHOULD
   NOT be used in messages from the peer to server.

   The Session-ID field is arbitrary length and is proceeded by its
   2-octet length specified in network-byte order.

   Following the Session-ID is an arbitrary number of Diameter AVPs.
   AVPs already contain a length field internally, so they can be parsed
   without additional information.

   The payload can be graphically depicted as:

5.  Bindings Requirements for EAP Methods

   This section describes a set of general requirements for EAP methods
   implementing the protected exchange of arbitrary data using the
   techniques described in this draft.

   An EAP method requiring the protected exchange of payloads during its
   execution in order to enable certain features MUST:

   o  support at least one secure cryptographic algorithm that can be
      used for integrity protection, such as an HMAC;
   o  derive a session key that can be used in the integrity protection
      algorithm, as soon as fresh EAP session keys are available; and
   o  define a container enabling the exchange of arbitrary payloads;
      and
   o  provide an integrity-protected channel for at least 3 protocols
      flows (i.e. 1.5 roundtrips) in which containers with payloads can
      be securely exchanged

   Optionally an EAP method MAY also support an encryption algorithm
   that is used with a freshly derived encryption key to provide
   confidentiality of all data that is exchanged in the protected
   channel.

Internet-Draft                 EAP-AAAPAY                       May 2010


   Only existing EAP methods already satisfying these requirements can
   support features that require the protected exchange of AAA payloads.

   New EAP methods SHOULD be designed to meet all requirements.

   For features demanding the protected exchange of potentially large
   chunks of information, the support of fragmentation is RECOMMENDED.


6.  Bindings for Existing EAP Methods

   This section describes how binding tokens can be included in some
   existing EAP methods that already meet the requirements for secure
   transport of arbitrary data as specified in Section 5.

6.1.  Generalized Pre-Shared Key (GPSK)

   EAP-GPSK [RFC5433] defines protected data payloads.  The protected
   channel is available in three of its protocol flows, namely
   EAP-GPSK-2, EAP-GPSK-3, and EAP-GPSK-4, and provides integrity-
   protection.  If a ciphersuite with encryption is selected (e.g.
   Ciphersuite 1 in [RFC5433]) the channel also provides
   confidentiality.

   Use by GPSK simply requires instantiation of a new protected data
   specifier (PData/Specifier):

   o  0x0000002 (IANA-TBD): AAA Payload

6.2.  Pre-Shared Key (PSK)

   EAP-PSK [RFC4764] defines a protected channel.  In its standard mode,
   EAP-PSK provides a protected channel for payloads in two of its
   flows, namely EAP-PSK-2 and EAP-PSK-3.  Features requiring additional
   flows can be supported in EAP-PSK extended authentication mode.  The
   protected channel is integrity-protected and encrypted.

   Use by PSK simply requires instantiation of a new EXT_Type value:

   o  0x01 (IANA-TBD): AAA Payload

6.3.  Password Authenticated Exchange (PAX)

   EAP-PAX [RFC4746] provides an authenticated data exchange (ADE) in
   three of its protocol flows (EAP-PAX-2, EAP-PAX-3, and EAP-PAX-4).
   The channel provides integrity-protection but no encryption.  Channel
   binding is explicitly supported in EAP-PAX, in which case the ADE
   flag needs to be set, and the ADE TYPE needs to be set to 0x02 for

   client channel binding data and to 0x03 for server channel binding
   data.

   Additional features could be supported by instantiation of a new ADE
   type:

   o  0x04 (IANA-TBD): AAA Payload

6.4.  Tunneled Transport Layer Security (TTLS)

   EAP-TTLS [RFC5281] uses Diameter Attribute-Value-Pairs (AVPs) for its
   messaging.  As such it natively supports transporting AAA payloads.
   Once the TLS tunnel is established, a variable number of flows can be
   exchanged in the second phase, e.g. to exchange payloads in an
   integrity-protected and encrypted channel.  No protocol changes are
   necessary.

6.5.  Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (FAST)

   EAP-FAST [RFC4851] uses Type-Length-Values (TLVs) for its messaging.
   Once the TLS tunnel is established a variable number of flows can be
   exchanged in the second phase, e.g. to exchange payloads in an
   integrity-protected and encrypted channel.  To embed binding tokens,
   a new TLV must be defined:

   o  0x15 (IANA-TBD): AAA Payload


7.  Security Considerations

   Section 3 documented a variety of requirements for EAP methods to
   transport these AAA payloads.  They MUST support identity protection
   of arbitrary payloads, and SHOULD support confidentiality.  Each
   method's security considerations section would detail how they
   achieve those requirements.

   The payload includes the EAP Session-ID field.  This is to prevent
   replay attacks.  In particular, depending on how an EAP method
   implements their secured channel, it may or may not be
   cryptographically bound to the rest of the session.  By explicitly
   including the EAP Session-ID, we prevent replay attacks.
   Implementations MUST verify the consistency of the Session-ID
   received in the AAA payloads.

   Certainly there are a whole host of issues surrounding the security
   of what may be contained within the AAA payload format.  If the
   information being transported requires confidentiality, then the
   method SHOULD support that.  Otherwise sensitive data could be

   disclosed.


8.  IANA Considerations

   We require registry from a variety of IANA repositories.

   From "EAP-GPSK PData/Specifier":

   o  0x0000002 (IANA-TBD): AAA Payload

   From "EAP EXT_Type Numbers":

   o  0x01 (IANA-TBD): AAA Payload

   From "EAP-PAX ADE Type Namespace":

   o  0x04 (IANA-TBD): AAA Payload

   From "EAP-FAST TLV Types":

   o  0x15 (IANA-TBD): AAA Payload

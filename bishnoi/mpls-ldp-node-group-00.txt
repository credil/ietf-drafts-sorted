Abstract 

   [RFC5036] and [MLDP] describes the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) 
   for setup of point-to-point (P2P), point to multi-point (P2MP) and 
   multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). 
   Upstream node selection for P2MP/MP2MP LSP and label map propagation 
   for P2P is based on route availability and local policy. If multiple 
   paths are available then there is no method for selection of certain 
   preferred nodes. A new method is defined in this document that can 
   optionally be used as a tiebreaker among multiple available paths in 
   upstream node selection. This method provides a mechanism to guide 
   traffic via specific set of nodes in a network.

1. Introduction 

   LDP downstream node selection for P2P LSP and upstream node selection 
   for P2MP/MP2MP LSP is based on route availability at each node. If 
   multiple such paths are available then node resolving LDP FEC based 
   on route is based on local policy.  

   In case of availability of multiple paths, there is no mechanism to 
   direct traffic towards preferred nodes or restrict traffic to flow 
   via nodes that are not preferred. Few applications that use LDP LSP 
   also require redundant paths for minimum downtime of service. One of 
   the requirements for such applications is to establish LSP via 
   disjoint nodes.

Internet-Draft          LDP Node and FEC Group             October 2009 
    

   This proposal defines a method to identify and select a preferred 
   node group to setup LSP. Scheme defined in this document also allows 
   restricting traffic flow within a certain set of nodes and also 
   avoiding nodes that belong to a group that is not preferred. This 
   proposal is only for preferred node selection and does not address 
   selection or avoiding preferred links. 

   This document defines a node level attribute to identify selection 
   group and a mechanism to advertise and propagate an LDP FEC with 
   group attribute. This scheme may be applied to P2P and P2MP/MP2MP 
   LSP. This method can be applied to P2P LSP during decision process to 
   send label map to a peer. For P2MP/MP2MP LSP, this method is applied 
   during upstream node selection. 

   This document defines two new LDP parameters: 

     . Node group 

     . FEC group mapping  

2. Terminology  

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5036] and [MLDP]. 

3. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119]. 

4. LDP node and FEC group 

   Group mapping of a node may be advertised to a peer using "Node Group 
   Capability" message. Group mapping per FEC may be advertised to a 
   peer using "FEC Group TLV" in Label Map message.   

4.1. Node Group Capability 

   An LSR may advertise node group map capability to an LDP peer using 
   method defined in [RFC5561]. Node group message must be silently 
   discarded if the receiving node does not support it.

Internet-Draft          LDP Node and FEC Group             October 2009 
    

   processing P2MP/MP2MP LSP label map message selects a single upstream 
   node based on criteria defined in [MLDP].  

   If a FEC group mapping is included in label map message then the 
   receiving node may choose sending the label map message further to 
   its peers based on group mapping received in label map. FEC group 
   mapping must then match peer node group advertisement to qualify to 
   receive a label map.  

   For P2P LSP, if include type is "Strict" then the label map message 
   MUST only be propagated to peers that have all the groups. If exclude 
   type is "Strict" then the label map message MUST not be propagated to 
   peers that have any of the groups. 

   For P2MP/MP2MP LSP, if include type is "Strict" then the label map 
   message MUST only be propagated to a peer that has all the groups. If 
   exclude type is "Strict" then the label map message MUST not be 
   propagated to a peer that has any of the groups. 

   If multiple peers qualify then include and exclude type must be used 
   as a tiebreaker. "Strict" is preferred over "Loose" group map. 

        
5. Limitations 

   This scheme does not guarantee setup of LSP if "Strict" group option 
   for an LDP FEC is enabled. This scheme requires proper network 
   provisioning for it to work. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The same security considerations apply as for the base LDP 
   specification, as described in [RFC5036] and MP LDP specification, as 
   described in [MLDP]. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires allocation of Node Group Capability and FEC 
   Group TLV.

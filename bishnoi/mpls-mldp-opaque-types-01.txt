Abstract 

   [MLDP] describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) 
   for setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint 
   (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). LDP forwarding equivalence class 
   (FEC) elements used to establish P2MP and MP2MP LSPs include type-
   length-value (TLV) fields that carry information meaningful to 
   Ingress LSRs and Leaf LSRs and are termed as Opaque Value Elements in 
   [MLDP]. This document defines Opaque Value Element structure to be 
   used for provisioning P2MP and MP2MP Provider tunnels (P-Tunnels) for 
   Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN). It is envisioned that this 
   would be useful for security and manageability of P-Tunnels used for 
   MVPN from the ones provisioned for other applications and vice-versa.

1. Introduction 

   [MLDP] defines the extensions to LDP and procedures for establishing 
   P2MP and MP2MP LSPs in Multi-Protocol Label Switch (MPLS) networks. 
   Throughout this document P2MP and MP2MP LSPs are collectively 
   referred as multi-point (MP) LSPs. When a MP LSP is setup, the LDP 
   signaling messages include a forwarding equivalence class (FEC) 
   element that uniquely identifies the MP LSP in LDP. 

   For the setup of a P2MP LSP with LDP, P2MP FEC Element is used as a 
   FEC Element in LDP FEC TLV. Similarly for MP2MP LSP, MP2MP FEC

   Element is used. Both types of FEC elements contain MP Opaque Value 
   Element in type-length-value format. 

       The LDP MP Opaque Value Element defined in [MLDP] is as follows: 
 
      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     | Type          | Length                        | Value ...     | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+               | 
     ~                                                               ~ 
     |                                                               | 
     |                               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |                               |

                                Figure 1. 

   The use of the opaque value in MP FEC Element provides the 
   flexibility to structure an MP FEC Element to best fit the needs of a 
   particular application or provisioning model. 

   An opaque value that is globally unique would facilitate MP LSP 
   management and security in large inter-AS (autonomous system) and 
   inter-provider environments. Providers would not have to worry about 
   opaque value overlap during provisioning LDP MP LSPs for various 
   applications. Globally unique opaque values per application types 
   could aid in troubleshooting as well. 

   For example, a provider may provision P2MP LSPs in its network by 
   manually provisioning at the root and the leaf nodes. The same root 
   node may also initiate dynamic provisioning of P2MP LSPs for MVPN   
   P-Tunnels by using BGP auto-discovery (AD) procedures described in 
   [BGP-MVPN]. For manageability and security reasons, it is required to 
   have a separate Opaque Value Element space available entirely for 
   manual provisioning and another space for allocation and distribution 
   by BGP AD procedures for MVPNs. 

   This document defines opaque value structures based on [MLDP] that: 

     .  Ensures uniqueness among applications if desired by provider. 
        This will facilitate provisioning of LDP MP Tunnels for various 
        applications without conflict of Opaque Value Element space.

   This is accomplished by defining new opaque value element types and 
   the associated formats of the value field. 

2. Terminology  

   This document uses the terminology defined in [MLDP], [MVPN] and 
   [BGP-MPN]. 

3. Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119]. 

4. Structure for the New Opaque Value Element Type 

   [MLDP] defines the format of P2MP and MP2MP FEC Element and the use 
   and semantics of Opaque Value Elements. 

4.1. Opaque Value Element Type 0 

   This document recommends to use type 0 to manage the identifier space 
   for manual or statically provisioned general purpose P2MP and MP2MP 
   LSPs. Mapping of traffic to MP LSPs provisioned with this type is 
   outside the scope of this document. 

   Statically provisioned P2MP and MP2MP LSPs preferably should have a 
   common identifier space across implementations. Recommendation to use 
   type 0 for all statically provisioned P2MP and MP2MP LSPs would allow 
   common identifier space to be available across all implementations. 
   This would avoid incompatibility of identifier space across multiple 
   vendor implementations and allow seamless replacement of root node 
   without changing configuration on all leaf nodes.

     . AII Type = 0x00 
     . Length = length of value field in octets. The length is set to 
        4. 
     . LSP Identifier = A 4-octet field containing a value that is 
        unique at a root node. 
 

4.2. Opaque Value Element Type 1 

   Opaque Value Element Type 1 is defined to be used exclusively for 
   dynamically provisioned MP LDP Tunnels for MVPNs [BGP-MVPN]. This 
   enables the opaque value space to be managed and used entirely for 
   BGP MVPNs without any risk of overlap with other applications that 
   use LDP MP Tunnels.  

   [BGP-MVPN] defines and uses a new BGP attribute, called P-Multicast 
   Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) attribute that is distributed 
   with MVPN AD routes in BGP. The attribute carries a Tunnel Type and 
   Tunnel Identifier of the P-Tunnel bound to MCAST-VPN-NLRI [BGP-MPN]. 
   If Tunnel type is set to LDP P2MP LSP then it carries P2MP FEC 
   Element with Opaque Value Element type 1. If tunnel type is set to 
   mLdp MP2MP LSP then it carries MP2MP FEC Element with Opaque Value 
   Element type 1.  

   The Opaque Value Element type 1 uses a 32 bit Global-ID to create 
   globally unique values of P-Tunnels. The encoding of opaque value 
   element type 1 is shown in Figure 3. below.

     . Global ID = This is a 4-octet field containing a value that is 
       unique within P-Tunnels initiated by BGP AD at a root node. 
    
   This type of Opaque Value Element is mapped to traffic by procedures 
   defined in [BGP-MVPN] and is outside the scope of this document. 
    
4.3. Opaque Value Element Type 2 

   Opaque Value Element Type 2 is defined to be used exclusively for 
   statically provisioned MP LDP Tunnels for MVPNs [MVPN]. This enables 
   the opaque value space to be managed and used entirely for static 
   MVPNs without any risk of overlap with other applications that use 
   LDP MP Tunnels.  

   Statically provisioned P2MP and MP2MP LSPs for MVPN is based on the 
   encoding as specified in RFC2685 in combination with a PMSI ID. PSMI 
   ID number 0 indicates a Mi-PMSI, non-zero numbers indicate a S-PMSI.

   defined in [MVPN] and is outside the scope of this document. 
    
        
5. Security Considerations 

   The same security considerations apply as for the base LDP 
   specification, as described in [RFC5036] and MP LDP specification, as 
   described in [MLDP]. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires allocation of new Opaque Value Element Types 
   (0x00 and 0x02).  

7. Conclusions 

   Further types of Opaque Value Elements are a subject of future study 
   and would be defined in later versions based on requirements.

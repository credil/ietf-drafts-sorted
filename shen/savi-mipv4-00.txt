1. Introduction  

   SAVI supports all address assignment mechanisms. In mobile ip
   environment, it's a different situation. In MIPv4, the MN is
   allowed to use the HoA (home address) as the source address to send
   packets to the CN (correspondent node), while the HoA is not within
   the foreign network prefix.
   
   This document specifies a mechanism to create bindings between MIPv4
   MN's HoAs and trustable anchors. SAVI can use the bindings to 
   validation the source addresses of the packets generated by MIPv4 
   MNs.
   
   This mechanism is a supplement to the other SAVI solutions.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
   
3. Mechanism Overview

   This mechanism performs MIPv4 Registration snooping to set up 
   bindings between MN's HoAs and corresponding binding anchors. The 
   bindings will be used to validate the HoA of the packets generated by
   MIPv4 MN.
   
   This mechanism SHOULD be deployed on the access device(access switch,
   wireless access point, etc).

4. SAVI MIPv4 Scenario
  
   Figure 1 depicts a typical MIPv4 scenario in SAVI environment. There 
   is at least one FA (Foreign Agent). The binding process of MIPv4 MN's

   HoA is independent of other address binding mechanisms.
   
   SAVI-FA-Trusted attribution and SAVI-MN-Validation attribution will
   be described in section 7.

   BST maintains all the binding information between SAVI and MIPv4 MN.
   Here is the detail:
   
   Anchor: The trustable binding anchor which is used to validate source 
           address. Switch ports Security Associations are the most 
           common ones. Which kind of anchor to use is up to the
           implementation, while in wireless environment security 
           associations are recommended.
           
   Address: MN's home address or MN's care-of address or NULL address. 
            This field contains the address of the MIPv4's node to bind.
            The NULL address will temporarily used when MN don't has the
            HoA.
            
   State: This field maintains the binding state.The state transit will 
          be described in section 8.
          
   LifeTime: The LifeTime records the lifetime of the binding entry. 
             When the lifetime times out, the entry becomes invalid. 
             
   Identification: It records the identification of MN's registration
                   request and matches the corresponding registration 
                   reply.
                   
5.2. Data Plane Data Structure: Filtering Table(FT)

                   +----------+---------+
                   |  Anchor  | Address |
                   +----------+---------+
                   | A_Anchor |  A_CoA  |
                   +----------+---------+

                   +----------+---------+

   FT is derived from BST, and contains the bindings between binding
   anchor and the address.This table is only used to validate the HoA
   of MIPv4 MN. Here is the detail:
   
   Anchor: the trustable binding anchor which will be used to validate 
   source address. 
   
   Address: MN's home address or MN's care-of address.

6. MIPv4 Registration Snooping

   This section the process of MIPv4 Registration Snooping. When the MN 
   leaves the home network and enters a foreign network, it has to
   register its CoA in HA(home agent). There are two registration modes:
   Registration via Foreign Agent and Direct Registration.

   The details of MIPv4 Registration are defined RFC3344.

6.1. Registration via Foreign Agent
   
   When MN realizes that it enters a foreign network, it initiates the 
   registration procedure. MN sends registration request message to FA.
           
   On receiving the registration request, SAVI extracts the necessary 
   information from the request and creates new BST entry, and forward 
   the request.
   
   On receiving the registration request, FA processes the request and 
   sends registration request to HA for the MN. HA processes the request 
   and sends registration reply message to FA.
   
   On receiving the registration reply, FA processes the reply and sends
    registration reply to the MN.
    
   On receiving the registration reply, SAVI updates the corresponding 
   entry in BST and FT, and forward the reply.

6.2. Direct Registration
        
   When MN realizes that it enters a foreign network, before it
   initiates the registration procedure, MN has to get a valid ip
   address within the foreign network prefix. The address allocation 
   can be DHCP, manual configuration, etc. The allocated ip address is 
   called Co-located CoA. Note that the Co-located CoA MUST be bound in
   SAVI. The MN sends registration request to HA directly.   
   
   On receiving the registration request, SAVI extracts the necessary

   information from the request and creates new BST entry, and forward 
   the request.
   
   HA processes the registration request, and sends registration reply
   to MN.
   
   On receiving the registration reply, SAVI updates the corresponding

7. Binding Anchor Attribute

   SAVI-MN-Validation Attribute is used on binding anchor on which the 
   MN Home Addresses are to be validated. The filtering process on 
   binding anchors with such attribute is described in section 10.

   SAVI-FA-Trusted Attribute is used on binding anchor on the path to 
   a trustable Foreign Agent.

8. Binding State Description

   According to the mobility registration procedure, two states are 
   defined: PENDING and BOUND.
   
   PENDING: This state indicates that SAVI has received the registration 
            request message and is waiting for the registration reply 
            message.In this state, the binding between MN's HoA and 
            trustable anchor is incomplete.
            
   BOUND: This state indicates that SAVI has received the registration
          request message and the corresponding reply message which 
          indicates the registration is accepted.In this state, the
          binding generates an entry in FT to validate the source 
          address of MN.

9. Binding State Management

9.1. Binding Set Up

9.1.1. From NULL to PENDING

9.1.1.1. Trigger Event

   A Registration Request message is received from SAVI-MN-Validation 
   attribute anchor.
   
9.1.1.2. Event Validation

   SAVI checks current BST as follows: 
   
   1. Whether the limitation on binding entry number of this binding 
   anchor will be exceeded if a new entry is triggered.
   
9.1.1.3. Following Actions   

   If the check is failed, the registration request message SHOULD be 
   discarded.
   
   If the check is passed,SAVI MUST create an entry for the binding 
   anchor in the Binding State Table (BST), set the state field to 
   PENDING, set the LifeTime field to MAX_PENDING_TIME. The ID field of
   the request packet MUST also be recorded in the entry.

   Then SAVI MUST forward the Registration Request.
   
9.1.2. From PNDING to BOUND

9.1.2.1. Trigger Event

   A Registration Reply message is received from SAVI-FA-Validation 
   attribute anchor.

9.1.2.2. Event Validation

   SAVI checks current BST and the message as follows: 

   1. Whether there is an entry with the corresponding ID in PENDING 
      state in the BST.
   2. Whether the Reply indicates the Request is accepted.
   
9.1.2.3. Following Actions

   If check1 failed, SAVI SHOULD forward the Registration Reply.
   
   If check1 passed and check2 passed,SAVI MUST records LifeTime in the 
   Reply message in the corresponding entry and HoA if necessary, and 
   set the State filed from PENDING to BOUND.
   
   +----------+---------+---------+----------------+----------+

9.1.3.1. Trigger Event

   A Registration Reply message is received from SAVI-FA-Validation 
   attribute anchor.
   
9.1.3.2. Event Validation

   SAVI checks current BST and the message as follows: 
   
   1. Whether there is an entry with the corresponding ID in PENDING 
      state in the BST.
   2. Whether the Reply indicates the Request is denied.

9.1.3.3. Following Actions

   SAVI MUST delete the corresponding entry in the BST.
   
9.2. Binding Remove

   1. SAVI receives Registration Reply message with the corresponding 
      ID in PENDING state in the BST and the Reply indicates the 
      Registration Request is denied.
   2. The entry in BOUND state in the BST times out. The corresponding 
      entry in the FT MUST also be removed.
   3. The entry in PENDING state in the BST times out.

9.3. State Machine of MIPv4 Snooping

   The main state transits are listed as follows. Note that precondition 
   of state transit is not included. Triggering events must satisfy the 
   preconditions before changing the state.

10. Filtering Specifications

   Agent Solicitation/Advertisement, Registration Request/Reply are 
   treated as Control Packets, and others are treated as Data Packets.
   
10.1. Data Packet Filtering

   Data packets with a binding anchor which has attribute SAVI-MN-
   Validation MUST be checked.

   If the source address of a packet associated with its binding anchor
   is in the FT, this packet SHOULD be forwarded; or else the packet 
   SHOULD be discarded, or alternatively the SAVI SHOULD record this
   violation.
   
10.2. Control Packet Filtering

   Forward Agent Solicitation Message from binding anchor with the SAVI-
   MN-Validation attribute.
  
   Forward Registration Request Message from binding anchor which with 
   the SAVI-MN-Validation attribute.
    
   Discard Agent Advertisement Message not from binding anchor with the 
   SAVI-FA-Trust attribute.
  
   Discard Registration Reply messages not from binding anchor with the 
   SAVI-FA-Trust attribute.

11. About LifeTime

   The LifeTime field in BST records the lifetime of the entry.
   
   In PENDING state, lifetime records the PENDING_TIME, which indicates 
   the Registration Reply is expected within PENDING_TIME. If it timed 
   out, the entry is removed.
   
   In BOUND state, lifetime records the lifetime in Registration Reply 
   message, which indicates the HoA of the MN is registered to use.
   
12. MN CoA Considerations

   In Registration Via FA mode, FA can validate MN and HA. While in
   Direct Registration mode, MN registers to HA directly using 
   co-located CoA. Although Co-located CoA MUST be bound in SAVI, it's
   still lack of validation of MN's HoA and HA.
   
   In this solution for MIPv4, Registration via Foreign Agent is 
   recommended.

13. Security Considerations

   1. When MN uses Co-located CoA and registers to HA directly, MN and
      HA may cooperate to deceive SAVI. As described in section 12, 
      Registration via Foreign Agent is recommended, even when MN can 
      get Co-located CoA. In agent advertisement, the R bit SHOULD be
      set.
   2. A malicious MN can keep sending forged Registration Request, which 
      takes up a lot of entries in BST. One improvement is rate 
      limitation.

14. IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration currently.

   GOST 28147-89 is the unified cryptographic transformation algorithm 
   for information processing systems of different purposes, defining 
   the encryption/decryption rules and the message authentication code
   (MAC) generation rules.

   This cryptographic transformation algorithm is intended for hardware 
   or software implementation and corresponds to the cryptographic 
   requirements. It puts no limitations on the encrypted information 
   secrecy level.

2. Applicability 

   GOST 28147-89 defines encryption/decryption model and MAC generation
   for a given message (document) that is meant for transmission via 
   insecure public telecommunication channels between data processing 
   systems of different purposes. 

   GOST 28147-89 is required for use in the Russian Federation by all
   data processing systems providing public services.

   [+]' is addition of the 32-bit vectors modulo 2^32-1.

   1..N is all values from 1 to N.

4 General Statements

   4.1. The structure model of the cryptographic transformation
   algorithm (a cryptographic model) contains:

   - a 256 bit key data store (KDS) consisting of eight 32-bit
     registers (X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7);

   - four 32-bit registers (N1, N2, N3, N4);

   - two 32-bit registers (N5, N6) containing constants C2, C1;

   - two 32-bit adders modulo 2^32 (CM1, CM3);

   - a 32-bit adder of bitwise sums modulo 2 (CM2);

   - a 32-bit adder modulo (2^32-1) (CM4);

   - an adder modulo 2 (CM5), with no limitation to its 
     width;

   - a substitution box (K);

   - a register for a cyclic shift of 11 steps to the top digit (R).

4.2. A substitution box (S-box) K consists of eight substitution points 
   K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, K6, K7, K8, with 64 bit memory. A 32-bit
   vector coming to the substitution box is divided into eight
   successive 4-bit vectors, and each of them is transformed into a
   4-bit vector by a corresponding substitution point. A substitution
   point is a table consisting of 16 lines, each containing 4 bits. 
   The incoming vector defines the line address in the table, and the
   contents of that line is the outgoing vector. Then these 4-bit
   outgoing vectors are successively combined into a 32-bit vector.

   Remark: the standard doesn't define any S-boxes. Some of them are
   defined in [RFC4357].

4.3. When adding and cyclically shifting binary vectors, the registers 
   with larger numbers are considered the top digits.
                                                 
4.4. When writing a key (W1, W2, ..., W256), Wq = 0..1, q = 1..256, 
   in the KDS the value W1 is written into the 1-st bit of the register
   X0, the value W2 is written into the 2-nd bit of the register X0, 
   ..., the value W32 is written into the 32-nd bit of the register X0;
   the value W33 is written into the 1-st bit of the register X1, the 
   value W34 is written into the 2-nd bit of the register X1, ..., the 
   value W64 is written into the 32-nd bit of the register X1; the 

V.Dolmatov             Expires    June 21, 2010               [Page 4]   

   value W65 is written into the 1-st bit of the register X2 etc.; the
   value W256 is written into the 32-nd bit of the register X7.

4.5. When rewriting the information, the value of p-th bit of one 
   register (adder) is written into the p-th bit of another register
   (adder).

4.6. The values of the constants C1, C2 in the registers N5 and
   N6 are in the Appendix 1.

4.7. The keys defining fillings of KDS and the substitution box K tables
   are secret elements and are provided in accordance with the 
   established procedure.

   The filling of the substitution box K is described in GOST 28147-89
   as a long-term key element common for a whole computer network. 
   Usually K is used as a parameter of algorithm, some possible sets
   of K are described in [RFC4357].

4.8 The cryptographic model contemplates four working modes:

   - data encryption (decryption) in the electronic codebook (ECB) mode;

   - data encryption (decryption) in the counter (CNT) mode;

   - data encryption (decryption) in the cipher feedback (CFB) mode;

   - the MAC generation mode.

   [RFC4357] describes also the CBC mode of GOST 28147-89, but this mode
   is not a part of the standard.

5. The Electronic Codebook Mode

5.1. Encryption of plain text in the electronic codebook mode

   5.1.1.  The plain text to be encrypted is split into 64-bit blocks. 
   Input of a binary data block Tp = (a1(0), a2(0), ... , a31(0), 
   a32(0), b1(0), b2(0), ..., b32(0)) into the registers N1 and N2 is 
   done so that the value of a1(0) is put into the first bit of N1, the 
   value of a2(0) is put into the second bit of N1 etc., and the value 
   of a32(0) is put into the 32nd bit of N1. The value of b1(0) is put 
   into the first bit of N2, the value of b2(0) is put into the 2_nd bit
   of N2 etc., and the value of b32(0) is input into the 32nd bit of N2. 

   The result is the state (a32(0), a31(0), ..., a2(0), a1(0)) of the 
   register N1 and the state (b32(0), b31(0), ..., b1(0)) of the 
   register N2.

   5.1.2.  The 256 bits of the key are entered into the KDS. The
   contents of eight 32-bit registers X0, X1,  ..., X7 are:

V.Dolmatov             Expires    June 21, 2010               [Page 5]

      X0 = W32, W31, ... , W2, W1
   
      X1 = W64, W63, ... , W34, W33

      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

      X7 = W256, W255 ..., W226, W225



   5.1.3. The algorithm for enciphering 64-bit blocks of plain text in
   the electronic codebook mode consists of 32 rounds.

   In the first round the initial value of register N1 is added 
   modulo 2^32 in the adder CM1 to the contents of the register X0.
   Note: the value of register N1 is unchanged.

   The result of the addition is transformed in the substitution block 
   K, and the resulting vector is put into the register R, where it is
   cyclically shifted by 11 steps towards the top digit. The result of 
   this shift is added bitwise modulo 2 in the adder CM2 to the 32-bit 
   contents of the register N2. The result produced in CM2 is then
   written into N1, and the old contents of N1 are written in N2.
   Thus the first round ends.

   The subsequent rounds are similar to the first one: in the second
   round the contents of X1 is read from the KDS, in the third round 
   the contents of X2 are read from the KDS etc., in the 8th round the 
   contents of X7 are read from the KDS. In the rounds 9 through 16 and 
   17 through 24 the contents of the KDS are read in the same order:

      X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7.

   In the last eight rounds from the 25th to the 32nd the contents of
   the KDS are read backwards:

      X7, X6, X5, X4, X3, X2, X1, X0.

   Thus, during the 32 rounds of encryption, the following order of
   choosing the registers' contents is implemented:
   
      X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7,

      X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X7, X6, X5, X4, X3, X2, X1, X0

   In the 32nd round the result in the adder CM2 is written into the
   register N2, and the old contents of register N1 are unchanged.

   The contents of the registers N1 and N2 after the 32nd round are an
   encrypted data block corresponding to a block of plain text.

   5.1.4. The equations for enciphering in the electronic codebook mode
   are:

      |a(j) = (a(j-1) [+] X(j-1)(mod 8))*K*R (+) b (j-1)          
      |                                                      j = 1..24;
      |b(j) = a(j-1)

      |a(j) = (a(j-1) [+] X(32-j))*K*R (+) b(j-1)      
      |                                          j = 25..31; a32 = a31;
      |b(j) = a(j-1)

      b(32) = (a(31) [+] X0)*K*R (+) b(31)                        j=32,


   where a(0) = (a32(0), a31(0), ..., a1(0)) is the initial contents of 
   N1 before the first round of encryption;

   b(0) = (b32(0), b31(0), ..., b1(0)) is the initial contents of N2 
   before the first round of encryption;

   a(j) = (a32(j), a31(j), ..., a1(j)) is the contents of N1 after the 
   j-th round of encryption;

   b(j) = (b32(j), b31(j), ..., b1(j)) is the contents of N2 after the 
                                 
   j^th round of encryption, j = 1..32.

   R is the operation of cyclic shift towards the top digit by 11 steps,
   as follows:

      R(r32, r31, r30, r29, r28, r27, r26, r25, r24, r23, r22, r21, r20, 
      ..., r2, r1) =

      (r21, r20, ..., r2, r1, r32, r31, r30, r29, r28, r27, r26, r25, 
      r24, r23, r22)

   5.1.5. The 64-bit block of ciphertext Tc is taken out of the 
   registers N1, N2 in the following order: 

   the first, second, ..., 32nd bit of the register N1, then the first,
   second, . .., 32nd bit of the register N2, i.e.,

      Tc = a1(32), a2(32), ..., a32(32), b1(32), b2(32), ..., b32(32)).

   The remaining blocks of the plain text in electronic codebook mode 
   are encrypted in the same fashion.

5.2. Decryption of the ciphertext in the electronic codebook mode

   5.2.1 The same 256-bit key that was used for encryption is loaded 
   into the KDS, the encrypted data to be deciphered is divided into 
   64-bit blocks. The loading of any binary information block

   Tc = (a1(32), a2(32), ..., a32(32), b1(32), b2(32), ..., b32(32))

V.Dolmatov             Expires    June 21, 2010               [Page 7]

   into the registers N1 and N2 is done in such a way that the contents
   of a1(32) are written into the first bit of N1, the contents of 
   a2(32) are written into the second bit of N1 and so on, the contents 
   of a32(32) are written into the 32nd bit of N1; the contents of 
   b1(32) are written into the first bit of N2 and so on, and the
   contents of b32(32) are written into the 32nd bit of N2.

   5.2.2. The decryption procedure uses the same algorithm as the
   encryption of plain text, with one exception: the contents of the
   registers X0, X1, ..., X7 are read from the KDS in the decryption
   rounds in the following order:

      X0,X1,X2,X3,X4,X5,X6,X7, X7,X6,X5,X4,X3,X2,X1,X0,

      X7,X6,X5,X4,X3,X2,X1,X0, X7,X6,X5,X4,X3,X2,X1,X0.

   5.2.3.  The decryption equations are:

      |a(32-j) = (a(32-j+1) [+] X(j-1))*K*R (+) b(32-j+1)             
      |                                                        j = 1..8;
      |b(32-1) = a(32-j+1)

      |a(32-j) = (a(32-j+1) [+] X(j-1)(mod 8))*K*R (+) b(32-j+1)     
      |                                                       j = 9..31;
      |b(32-1) = a(32-j+1)

      |a(0) = a(1)
      |                                                            j=32.
      |b(0) = (a(1) [+] X0)*K*R (+) b1

   5.2.4 The fillings of the adders N1 and N2 after 32 working rounds
   are a plain text block.

      Tp = (a1(0), a2(0), ... , a32(0), b1(0), b2(0), ..., b32(0))

   corresponding to the encrypted data block, and the value of a1(0) of
   the block Tp corresponds to the contents of the first bit of N1, the
   value of a2(0) corresponds to the contents of the second bit of N1
   etc., the value of b1(0) corresponds to the contents of the first 
   bit of N2, the value of b2(0) corresponds to the contents of the 
   second bit of N2 etc., the value of b32(0) corresponds to the 
   contents of 32nd bot of N2.

   The remaining blocks of encrypted data are decrypted similarly.

5.3. The encryption algorithm in the electronic codebook mode of a
   64-bit block Tp is denoted by A, that is

      A(Tp) is A(a(0), b(0)) = (a(32), b(32)) = Tc.

6. The counter encryption mode

6.1. Encryption of plain text in the counter encryption mode

   6.1.1  The plain text divided into 64-bit blocks Tp(1), Tp(2), 
   ..., Tp(M-1), Tp(M) is encrypted in the counter encryption mode 
   by bitwise addition modulo 2 in the adder CM5 with the running key 
   Gc produced in 64 bit blocks, that is:

      Gc = (Gc(1), Gc(2), ..., Gc(M-1), Gc(M))

   where M is defined by the size of the plain text being encrypted.
   Gc(i) is the i-th 64-bit block where i=1..M, the number of bit in
   a block Tp(M) can be less than 64, in this case the unused part of
   the running key block Gc(M) is discarded.

   6.1.2 256 bit of the key are put into the KDS. The registers N1 and
   N2 accept a 64-bit binary sequence (an initialisation vector) S =
   (S1, S2, ..., S64) that is the initial filling of these registers for
   subsequent generation of M blocks of the running key. The
   initialisation vector is put into the registers N1 and N2 so as the
   value of S1 is written into the first bit of N1, the value of S2 is
   written into the second bit of N1 etc., the value of S32 is written
   into the 32nd bit of N1; the value of S33 is written into the first
   bit of N2, the value of S34 is written into the 33th bit of N2, etc.,
   the value of S64 is written into the 32nd bit of N2.

   6.1.3 The initial filling of the registers N1 and and N2 (the
   initialisation vector S) is encrypted in the electronic codebook mode
   in accordance with the requirements from section 5.1. The result of
   that encryption A(S) = (Y0, Z0) is rewritten into the 32-bit
   registers N3 and N4 so as the contents of N1 are written into N3, and
   the contents of N2 are written into N4.

   6.1.4 The filling of the register N4 is added modulo (2^32-1) in the
   adder CM4 to the 32-bit constant C1 from the register N6, the result
   is written into N4. The filling of the register N3 is added modulo
   2^32 in the adder CM3 with the 32-bit constant C2 from the register
   N5, the result is written into N3.

   The filling of N3 is copied into N1, and the filling of N4 is
   copied into N2, while the fillings of N3 and N4 are kept.

   The filling of N1 and N2 is encrypted in the electronic codebook mode
   according to the requirements of the section 5.1. The resulting
   encrypted filling of N1 and N2 is the first 64-bit block of the
   running key Gc(1), this block is bitwise added modulo 2 in the adder
   CM5 with the first 64-bit block of the plain text:

      Tp(1) = (t1(1), t2(1), ..., t63(1), t64(1)).

   The result of this addition is a 64-bit block of the encrypted data

      Tc(1) = (tau1(1), tau2(1), ..., tau63(1), tau64(1)).

V.Dolmatov             Expires    June 21, 2010               [Page 9]

   The value of tau1(1) of the block Tc(1) is the result of addition
   modulo 2 in the CM5 the value t1(1) of the block Tp(1) to the value
   of the first bit of N1, the value of tau2(1) of the block Tc(1) is
   the result of addition modulo 2 in the CM5 the value of t2(1) from
   the block Tp(1) to the value of the second bit of N1 etc., the value
   of tau64(1) of the block Tc(1) is the result of addition modulo 2 in
   the CM5 of the value t64(1) of the block Tp(1) to the value of the
   32nd bit of N2.

   6.1.5 To get the next 64-bit block of the running key Gc(2) the
   filling of N4 is added modulo (2^32-1) in the adder CM4 with the
   constant C1 from N6, the filling of N3 is added modulo 2^32 in the
   adder CM3 with the constant C2 from N5. The new filling of N3 is
   copied into N1, the new filling of N4 is copied into N2, while the
   fillings of N3 and N4 are kept.

   The filling of N1 and N2 is encrypted in the electronic codebook mode
   according to the requirements of the section 5.1. The resulting
   encrypted filling of N1 and N2 is the second 64-bit block of the
   running key Gc(2), this block is bitwise added modulo 2 in the adder
   CM5 with the first 64-bit block of the plain text Tp(2). The
   remaining running key blocks Gc(3), Gc(4), ..., Gc(M) are generated
   and the plain text blocks Tp(3), Tp(4), ..., Tp(M) are encrypted
   similarly. If the length of the last M-th block of the plain text is
   less than 64 bit then only the corresponding number of bit from the
   last M-th block of the running key is uses, remaining bit are
   discarded. 

   6.1.6 The initialisation vector S and the blocks of encrypted data
   Tc(1), Tc(2), ..., Tc(M) are transmitted to the telecommunication
   channel or to the computer memory.


   6.1.7 The encryption equation is:

      Tc(i) = A(Y[i-1] [+] C2, Z[i-1]) [+]' C1) (+) Tp(i) 
            = Gc(i) (+) Tp(i)     i=1..M

   where:
   
   Y[i] is the contents of the register N3 after encrypting the
   i-th block of the plain text Tp(i);

   Z(i) is the contents of the register N4 after encrypting the 
   i-th block of the plain text Tp(i);

   (Y[0], Z[0]) = A(S).

6.2. Decryption of ciphertext in the counter encryption mode

   6.2.1 256 bit of the key that was used for encrypting the data Tp(1),
   Tp(2), ..., Tp(M) are put into the KDS. The initialisation vector S
   is put into the registers N1 and N2 and, like in the sections 6.1.2 -
   6.1.5 M blocks of the running key Gc(1), Gc(2), ..., Gc(M) are
   generated.  The encrypted data blocks Tc(1), Tc(2), ..., Tc(M) are
   added bitwise modulo 2 in the adder CM5 with the blocks of the
   running key, and this results in the blocks of plain text Tp(1),
   Tp(2), ..., Tp(M), and Tp(M) may contain less than 64 bit.

   6.2.2 The decryption equation is:

      Tp(i) = A (Y[i-1] [+] C2, Z[i-1] [+]' C1) (+) Tc(i) 
            = Gc(i) (+) Tc(i)     i = 1..M


7. The cipher feedback mode

7.1. Encryption of plain text in the cipher feedback mode

   7.1.1 The plain text is divided into 64-bit blocks Tp(1), Tp(2), ..., 
   Tp(M) and encrypted in the cipher feedback mode by bitwise addition 
   modulo 2 in the adder CM5 with the running key Gc generated in 64-bit 
   blocks, i.e. Gc(i)=(Gc(1), Gc(2), ..., Gc(M)), where M is defined by 
                                                                   ___
   the length of the plain text, Gc(i) is the i-th 64-bit block, i=1,M.
   The number of bits in the block Tp(M) may be less than 64.

   7.1.2 256 bit of key are put into the KDS. The 64-bit initialisation
   vector S = (S1, S2, ... S64) is put into N1 and N2 as described in
   the section 6.1.2. 

   7.1.3 The initial filling of N1 and N2 is encrypted in the electronic
   codebook mode in accordance with the requirements in section 6.1. The
   resulting encrypted filling N1 and N2 is the first 64-bit block of
   the running key Gc(1)=A(S), then this block is added bitwise modulo 2
   with the first 64-bit block of plain text Tp(1) = (t1(1), t2(1), ...,
   t64(1)).

   The result is 64-bit block of encrypted data

      Tc(1) = (tau1(1), tau2(1), ..., tau64(1)).

   7.1.4 The block of encrypted data Tc(1) is simultaneously the initial
   state of N1 and N2 for generating the second block of the running key
   Gc(2) and is written on feedback in these registers. Here the value
   of tau1(1) is written into the first bit of N1, the value of tau2(1)
   is written into the second bit of N1, etc., the value of tau32(1) is
   written into the 32nd bit of N1; the value of tau33(1) is written
   into the first bit of N2, the value of tau34(1) is written into the
   second bit of N2 etc., the value of tau64(1) is written into the 32nd
   bit of N2.

   The filling of N1, N2 is encrypted in the electronic codebook mode in
   accordance with the requirements in the section 6.1. The encrypted
   filling N1, N2 makes the second 64-bit block of the running key
   Gc(2), this block is added bitwise modulo 2 in the adder CM5 to the
   second block of the plain text Tp(2).

   The generation of subsequent blocks of the running key Gc(i) and the
   encryption of the corresponding blocks of the plain text Tp(i) 
   (i = 3..M) is performed similarly. If the length of the last M-th
   block of the plain text is less than 64 bit, only the corresponding
   number of bits of the M-th block of the running key Gc(M) is used,
   remaining bits are discarded.

   7.1.5. The encryption equations in the cipher feedback mode are:

      |Tc(1) = A(S) (+) Tp(1) = Gc(1) (+) Tp(1)
      |                                                  
      |Tc(i) = A(Tc(i-1)) (+) Tp(i) = Gc(i) + Tp(i), i = 2..M.

   7.1.6 The initialisation vector S and the blocks of encrypted data
   Tc(1), Tc(2), ..., Tc(M) are transmitted into the telecommunication
   channel or to the computer memory.

7.2. Decryption of ciphertext in the cipher feedback mode

   7.2.1 256 bits of the key used for the encryption of Tp(1), Tp(2), 
   ..., Tp(M) are put into the KDS. The initialisation vector S is put 
   into N1 and N2 similarly to 6.1.2. 

   7.2.2 The initial filling of N1, N2 (the initialisation vector S) is
   encrypted in the electronic codebook mode in accordance with the
   subsection 6.1. The encrypted filling of N1, N2 is the first block of
   the running key Gc(1) = A(S), this block is added bitwise modulo 2 in
   the adder CM5 with the encrypted data block Tc(1). This results in
   the first block of plain text Tp(1).

   7.2.3 The block of encrypted data Tc(1) makes the initial filling of
   N1, N2 for generating the second block of the running key Gc(2). The
   block Tc(1) is written in N1 and N2 in accordance with the
   requirements in the subsection 6.1, the resulted block Gc(2) is
   added bitwise modulo 2 in the adder CM5 to the second block of the
   encrypted data Tc(2). This results in the block of plain text Tc(2).

   Similarly, the blocks of encrypted data Tc(2), Tc(3), ..., Tc(M-1)
   are written in N1, N2 successively, and the blocks of the running key
   Gc(3), Gc(4), ..., Gc(M) are generated out of them in the electronic
   codebook mode. The blocks of the running key are added bitwise modulo
   2 in the adder CM5 to the blocks of the encrypted data Tc(3), Tc(4),
   ..., Tc(M), this results in the blocks of plain text Tp(3), Tp(4),
   ..., Tp(M), here the number of bits in the last block of the plain
   text Tp(M) can be less than 64 bit.

   7.2.4. The decryption equations in the cipher feedback mode are:

      |Tp(1) = A(S) (+) Tc(1) = Gc(1) (+) Tc(1)
      |                                                 
      |Tp(1) = A(Tc(i-1)) (+) Tc(i) = Gc(i) (+) Tc(i), i=2..M


8. Message authentication code (MAC) generation mode

8.1. To provide the protection from falsification of plain text
   consisting of M 64-bit blocks Tp(1), Tp(2), ..., Tp(M), M >= 2, an
   additional l-bit block is generated (the message authentication
   code I(l)). The process of MAC generation is the same for all the
   encryption/decryption modes.

8.2. The first block of plain text 

      Tp(1) = (t1(1), t1(2), ..., t64(1)) = (a1(1)[0], a2(1)[0], ...,
              a32(1)[0], b1(1)[0], b2(1)[0], ..., b32(1)[0])

   is written to the registers N1 and N2, the value of t1(1) = a1(1)[0] 
   is written into the first bit of N1, the value of t2(1) = a2(1)[0] is
   written into the second bit of N1, etc., the value of t32(1) =
   a32(1)[0] is written into the 32nd bit of N1; the value of t33(1) =
   b1(1)[0] is written into the first bit of N2 etc., the value of
   t64(1) = b32(1)[0] is written into the 32nd bit of N2.

8.3. The filling of N1 and N2 is transformed in accordance with the
   first 16 rounds of the encryption algorithm in the electronic 
   codebook mode (see the subsection 6.1). In the KDS there's the same 
   key that is used for encrypting the blocks of plain text Tp(1), 
   Tp(2), ..., Tp(M) in the corresponding blocks of encrypted data 
   Tc(1), Tc(2), ..., Tc(M).

   The filling of N1 and N2 after the 16 working rounds, looking like
   (a1(1)[16], a2(1)[16], ..., a32(1)[16], b1(1)[16], b2(1)[16], ...,
   b32(1)[16]), is added in CM5 modulo 2 to the second block Tp(2) =
   (t1(2), t2(2), ..., t64(2)).

   The result of this addition

      (a1(1)[16](+)t1(2), a2(1)[16](+)t2(2), ..., a32(1)[16](+)t32(2),
      b1(1)[16](+)t33(2), b2(1)[16](+)t34(2), ..., b32(1)[16](+)t64(2))

     =

      (a1(2)[0], a2(2)[0] ..., a32(2)[0], b1(2)[0], b2(2)[0], ...,
      b32(2)[0])

   is written into N1 and N2 and is transformed in accordance with the
   first 16 rounds of the encryption algorithm in the electronic 
   codebook mode.

V.Dolmatov             Expires    June 21, 2010               [Page 13]

   The resulting filling of N1 and N2 is added in the CM5 modulo 2 with
   the third block Tp(3) etc., the last block Tp(M) = (t1(M), t2(M),
   ..., t64(M)), padded if necessary to a complete 64-bit block by
   zeros, is added in CM5 modulo 2 with the filling N1, N2 
   (a1(M-1)[16], a2(M-1)[16], ..., a32(M-1)[16], b1(M-1)[16], 
   b2(M-1)[16], ..., b32(M-1)[16]).

   The result of the addition 

      (a1(M-1)[16](+)t1(M), a2(M-1)[16](+)t2(M), ..., a32(M-1)[16](+)
      t32(M), b1(M-1)[16](+)t33(M), b2(M-1)[16](+)t34(M), ..., 
      b32(M-1)[16](+)t64(M)) 
     
    =
      
      (a1(M)[0], a2(M)[0] ..., a32(M)[0], b1(M)[0], b2(M)[0], ..., 
      b32(M)[0])

   is written into N1, N2 and encrypted in the electronic codebook mode
   after the first 16 rounds of the algorithm's work. Out of the
   resulting filling of the registers N1 and N2

      (a1(M)[16], a2(M)[16] ..., a32(M)[16], b1(M)[16], b2(M)[16], ...,
      b32(M)[16]) 

   an l-bit string I(l) (the MAC) is chosen:

      I(l) = [a(32-l+1)(M)[16], a(32-l+2)(M)[16], ..., a32(M)[16]].

   The MAC I(l) is transmitted through the telecommunication channel or
   to the computer memory attached to the end of the encrypted data,
   i.e.  Tc(1), Tc(2), ..., Tc(M), I(l).

8.4. The encrypted data Tc(1), Tc(2), ..., Tc(M), when arriving, are
   decrypted, out of the resulting plain text blocks Tp(1), Tp(2), ...,
   Tp(M), the MAC I'(l) is generated as described in the subsection 5.3
   and compared with the MAC I(l) received together with the encrypted
   data from the telecommunication channel or from the computer memory.
   If the MACs are not equal, the resulting plain text blocks Tp(1),
   Tp(2), ..., Tp(M) are considered false.

   The MAC I(l) (I'(l)) can be generated either before encryption (after
   decryption, respectively) of the whole message, or simultaneously 
   with the encryption (decryption) in blocks. The first plain text 
   blocks, used in the MAC generation, can contain service information
   (the address section, a time mark, the initialisation vector etc.,)
   and they may be unencrypted.

   The parameter l value (the bit length of the MAC) is defined by the
   actual cryptographic requirements, while considering that the
   possibility of imposing false data is 2^-l.

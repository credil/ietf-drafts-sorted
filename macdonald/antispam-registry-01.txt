  Suggested values for SMTP Enhanced Status Codes for Anti-Spam Policy
                  draft-macdonald-antispam-registry-01

Abstract

   This document establishes a set of extended SMTP policy codes for
   anti-spam.  It seeks to provide additional codes for error texts that
   currently use the extended SMTP error code 5.7.1.  The anti-spam
   codes were determined by looking at error texts produced by major
   ISPs and finding commonalities.  The result is a new set of error
   texts with associated extended SMTP error codes.

Internet-Draft     Enhanced Status Codes for Anti-Spam    September 2010


1.  Introduction

   This RFC defines a set of Enhanced Status Codes [RFC3463] for SMTP
   related to anti-spam policy.  These codes are to be registered with
   the IANA Mail Enhanced Status Codes registry as defined in [RFC5248].
   While Anti-Spam policy is inherently a local decision, assigning
   these codes helps troubleshoot problems and lower support costs by
   allowing sending administrators to resolve many problems themselves.

   This document is being discussed on the SMTP mailing list,
   ietf-smtp@imc.org.


2.  Introducing the Anti-Spam Subject

   The most common extended SMTP code assigned to anti-spam policy is
   5.7.1.  This is because the subject code of 7 is meant for security
   or policy.  For anti-spam policy, the only logical detail code is 1,
   "Delivery not authorized, message refused".  Using 5.7.1 for many
   different anti-spam policies weakens the usefulness of extended SMTP
   error codes.  One of the motivations behind [RFC3463] was to re-
   distribute the classifications of SMTP error codes in order to
   provide a richer set of errors, and provide a means for machine-
   readable, human language independent status codes.  Thus a new
   subject code of 8 is introduced for anti-spam policy.


3.  Methodology of determining new detail codes

   All of the new detail text was gathered by surveying several existing
   large ISPs to see what messages were produce when presented with
   messages that violate their policies.  An attempt was then made to
   coalesce the messages together into common themes.  These themes
   where then simply assigned a detail number.

   While this document provides suggested text for each detail code,
   alternate text can be provided if the text is in the spirit of the
   suggested text.  This will allow sites to simply prepend the proper
   extended SMTP code to their existing text.  Sites that are starting
   to implement anti-spam policy SHOULD use the text provided in this
   document.

   While this document strives to document common anti-spam policies, it
   is by nature incomplete.  [RFC3463] notes that new subject and detail
   codes will be added over time.  This document is no exception to that
   and can be extended at future dates.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is directed to add the following values to the registry of Mail
   Enhanced Status Codes specified in [RFC5248].

   The Mail Enhanced Status Codes registry will be modified to add a new
   subject sub-code having the value 8.  This sub-code will be dedicated
   to anti-spam policy related SMTP errors.

   All following entries will use the following common fields:

   | Submitter:         | J. Macdonald |
   | Change Controller: | IESG         |
   +--------------------+--------------+

   The following Subject Sub-code is defined:

   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Code:        | X.8.YYY                                            |
   | Summary:     | Anti-Spam policy related                           |
   | Description: | All status codes related to anti-spam policy that  |
   |              | are not security related, as decided by a site     |
   |              | administrator.                                     |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+

4.1.  Enumerated Status Codes

   The following enumerated status codes are defined.

   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Code:        | X.8.0                                              |

   | Description: | This enhanced status code SHOULD be returned when  |
   |              | no other applicable anti-spam policy enhanced      |
   |              | status code is appropriate.  Administrators are    |
   |              | encouraged to contact the Author stating how other |
   |              | detail codes fail to satisfy their criteria in     |
   |              | order to facilitate an update to this RFC.         |
   |              | Administrators SHOULD indicate what policy is      |
   |              | being violated by including a URL providing        |
   |              | further details by appending the text with ": see  |
   |              | URL for further details."  X.8.0 should be used    |
   |              | for all errors for which there is no detail error  |
   |              | known.                                             |

   As stated in [RFC3463], use of enhanced status codes may disclose
   additional information about how an internal mail system is
   implemented beyond that available through the SMTP status codes.

   Some of the proposed additions to the response code list are security
   related.  Having these registered in one place to prevent collisions
   will improve their value.  Security error responses can leak
   information to active attackers (e.g., the distinction between "user
   not found" and "bad password" during authentication).  Documents
   defining security error codes should make it clear when this is the
   case, so that SMTP server software subject to such threats can
   provide appropriate controls to restrict exposure.

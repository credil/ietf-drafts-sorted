     1. Introduction 

        The SatLabs Group [SATLABS] is an international non-profit EEIG 
        (European Economic Interest Grouping) committed to large-scale 
        adoption and deployment of the Digital Video Broadcasting Return 
        Channel via Satellite (DVB-RCS) standard [ETSI-RCS]. SatLabs 
        members are service providers, satellite operators, system 
        integrators, terminal manufacturers and technology providers 
        with an interest in DVB-RCS. 

        Since its creation in 2001, the main goal of the SatLabs Group 
        has been to achieve interoperability between DVB-RCS terminals 
        and systems. Therefore, the Group has defined the SatLabs 
        Qualification Program that provides an independent certification 
        process for DVB-RCS Terminals based on System Recommendations 
        defined by SatLabs. To enhance products interoperability, beyond 
        the physical and MAC layer mechanisms defined in the DVB-RCS 
        standard, SatLabs has expanded its Recommendations in the field 
        of DVB-RCS terminal management [SATLABS]. As a part of this 
        effort, SatLabs has specified a common SNMP Management 
        Information Base (MIB) for DVB-RCS terminals, which is defined 
        in this document. 

        A DVB-RCS terminal is denoted as a Return Channel Satellite 
        Terminal (RCST) in the remainder of this document. This consists 
        of an Indoor Unit (IDU) and an Outdoor Unit (ODU) connected 
        through an Inter Facility Link (IFL), usually a coaxial L-band 
        interface. On the user side, the IDU is connected to the user 
        network through a Local Area Network (LAN) interface (usually 
        Ethernet). On the network side, the ODU is connected via a 
        satellite link (the Air Interface).

        The SatLabs Group DVB-RCS MIB is implemented in the IDU of an 
        RCST. RCST management can be performed either through the LAN 
        interface (Local management) or through the Air Interface 
        (Remote management from the Network Control Center, NCC). RCST 
        and NCC elements are shown on Figure 1.

        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to 
        the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 
        58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

     2.2. Glossary 

        The terms in this document are derived either from DVB-RCS 
        standard specifications [ETSI-RCS] or from SatLabs System 
        Recommendations [SATLABS]. 

     2.2.1. Star DVB-RCS network 

        This denotes a hub-and-spoke configuration where all 
        communications pass through a central hub, that usually also 
        includes the NCC. Peer-to-peer communication between RCSTs is 
        possible, but through a double satellite hop (this traffic has 
        to pass through the hub). 

     2.2.2. Mesh DVB-RCS network 

        This denotes a mesh configuration that supports peer-to-peer 
        communications in a single satellite hop directly between RCSTs. 

     2.2.3. Transparent DVB-RCS network 

        This denotes a network using transparent satellite transponders. 
        Star or mesh network configurations can be supported. In the 
        case of a mesh configuration, RCSTs need to incorporate a TDMA 
        receiver in addition to the TDM receiver.

     2.2.4. Regenerative DVB-RCS network 

        This denotes a network using regenerative satellite 
        transponders, i.e. including some On-Board Processing 
        functionality allowing demodulation and decoding of the uplink 
        TDMA signals and re-multiplex the traffic on the downlink. Star 
        or mesh network configurations can be supported. 

     2.2.5. DVB-RCS MAC layer 

        The DVB-RCS MAC Layer represents the air interface of an RCST, 
        as specified in [ETSI-RCS]. The interface is bi-directional and 
        supports IP traffic over hub-spoke (star) and mesh satellite 
        network topologies. 

     2.2.6. DVB-RCS TDM 

        The DVB-RCS TDM corresponds to the forward link of a DVB-RCS 
        transparent system or the downlink of a DVB-RCS regenerative 
        system. It is based on either the DVB-S or DVB-S2 standard 
        specified in [ETSI-DVBS] and [ETSI-DVBS2], respectively. In the 
        DVB-RCS context, this interface is uni or bi-directional, as it 
        may also be used for a return channel dedicated to a single 
        terminal. 

     2.2.7. DVB-RCS TDMA 

        The DVB-RCS TDMA corresponds to the return or mesh link of a RCS 
        transparent system or the uplink of a RCS regenerative system. 
        It is specified in [ETSI-RCS]. 

        In the context of star transparent and mesh regenerative DVB-RCS 
        systems, this interface is uni-directional. 

        In the context of mesh transparent DVB-RCS systems, this 
        interface is bi-directional.

     2.2.10. RCST 

        This is the Satellite Terminal, installed on the customer 
        premises. It is composed of the IDU and ODU. 

     2.2.11. NCC 

        The NCC provides Control and Monitoring Functions. It generates 
        control and timing signals for the operation of the DVB-RCS 
        Network. 

     2.2.12. Configuration file 

        The configuration file is XML formatted file, storing 
        configuration parameters for the RCST and their values. 

     2.2.13. Log file 

        The log file is stored at the RCST. This is used to log 
        particular events that occur on RCST side. 

     2.2.14. Installation log file 

        The installation log file is stored at the RCST. This logs 
        particular events that occur on RCST side, related to RCST 
        installation phase. 

     2.2.15. Antenna alignment 

        This is the process to align the RCST antenna, part of the ODU, 
        in order to enable bi-directional communication (uplink, 
        downlink) with the satellite network. 

     2.2.16. CW frequency 

        The CW frequency is the frequency of a Continuous Wave signal. 
        It is a narrowband carrier transmitted for the duration of 
        measurements during the installation of a RCST. 

     2.2.17. Request Class 

        A Request Class (RC) is a representation of a Per Hop Behavior 
        (PHB) at the MAC layer. It defines a behavior of the MAC layer 
        for a given aggregation of traffic. This behavior includes a 
        combination of Capacity Categories associated to the RC and a 
        Priority with respect to the other RCs supported by a RCST.

     2.2.18. Channel ID 

        Each Request Class is identified by a unique Channel_ID in the 
        communication between the RCST and the NCC. 

     2.2.19. ATM profile 

        The ATM profile is one of the two profiles for traffic burst 
        format on a DVB-RCS uplink. It is based on one or more 
        concatenated ATM cells, each of length 53 bytes, plus an 
        optional prefix. 

     2.2.20. MPEG profile 

        The MPEG profile is one of the two profiles for traffic burst 
        format on the DVB-RCS uplink. It is based on a number of 
        concatenated MPEG2-TS packets, each of length 188 bytes. 

     2.2.21. PID pool 

        For the MPEG profile several RCs may be mapped within a pool of 
        several PIDs to allow cross-RC Section Packing [RFC4259]. 
        Section packing can be used on all PIDs and higher priority 
        traffic can always pre-empt lower priority streams. This reduces 
        the need for padding. 

     2.2.22. Capacity Categories 

        The TDMA timeslot allocation process for the DVB-RCS uplink 
        supports several capacity categories. 

        The Capacity Categories CRA, RBDC and A/VBDC, when authorized 
        for a RC, have to be configured from the NCC. These 
        configuration parameters are used to inform the RCST of the 
        configuration of each Category at the NCC side and thus help in 
        Capacity Requests computation. 

        The configuration of these parameters is performed for each RC. 
        A SatLabs optional feature is defined that allows their 
        configuration at the RCST level in addition to configuration per 
        RC. This feature is denoted RCST_PARA. 

     2.2.22.1. Continuous Rate Assignment (CRA) 

        CRA is a rate capacity that is provided in full in a continuous 
        manner to the RCST while required.

     2.2.22.2. Rate-Based Dynamic Capacity (RBDC) 

        RBDC is rate capacity that is requested dynamically by an RCST. 
        RBDC capacity is provided in response to explicit requests from 
        the RCST to the NCC, such requests being absolute (i.e. 
        corresponding to the full rate currently being requested). Each 
        request overrides all previous RBDC requests from the same RCST, 
        and is subject to a maximum rate limit. 

     2.2.22.3. Volume-Based Dynamic Capacity (VBDC) 

        VBDC is volume capacity that is requested dynamically by an 
        RCST. VBDC capacity is provided in response to explicit requests 
        from the RCST to the NCC, such requests being cumulative (i.e. 
        each request adds to all previous requests from the same RCST). 

     2.2.22.4. Absolute Volume-Based Dynamic Capacity (AVBDC) 

        AVBDC is volume capacity that is requested dynamically by an 
        RCST. This capacity is provided in response to explicit requests 
        from the RCST to the NCC, such requests being absolute (i.e. 
        this request replaces the previous ones from the same RCST). 

        The combination of AVBDC and VBDC is seen as a single Capacity 
        Category, denoted A/VBDC. 

     2.2.22.5. Population ID 

        This defines a group of RCSTs within a Network. 

     2.2.23. Start transponder 

        This is the satellite transponder on which the communication is 
        initiated from a RCST point-of-view when in the installation 
        mode. The parameters corresponding to this transponder 
        (satellite orbital position, frequency, etc.) are stored at the 
        RCST as power-up configuration data. 

     2.2.24. DVB-S 

        DVB-S is the Digital Video Broadcast over Satellite [ETSI-DVBS]. 
        It is a framework and set of associated standards published by 
        ETSI for the transmission of video, audio, and data, using the 
        ISO MPEG-2 Standard [ISO-MPEG], over satellite links.

     2.2.25. DVB-S2 and CCM/VCM/ACM 

        DVB-S2 is the Second Generation of the Digital Video Broadcast 
        for Satellite applications standard [ETSI-DVBS2]. It is a 
        framework and set of associated standards published by ETSI for 
        the transmission of video, audio and data. 

        BBFRAME: The main framing unit of the DVB-S2 protocol stack. 

        CCM: In CCM transmission mode, the forward link uses a constant 
        set of transmission parameters (FEC coding rate and modulation 
        scheme) for all receivers. 

        VCM: In VCM transmission mode, the forward link uses 
        transmission parameters which are variable on a BBFRAME-by-
        BBFRAME, but fixed on a Receiver basis, according to fixed link 
        and propagation conditions for each Receiver. 

        ACM: In ACM transmission mode, the forward link uses 
        transmission parameters which are dynamically adjusted on a 
        BBFRAME-by-BBFRAME and Receiver-per-Receiver basis, according to 
        actual link and propagation conditions.  In order to implement 
        ACM, feedback from each Receiver has to be provided by DVB-RCS 
        return channel. 

     2.2.26. Interactive Network 

        This is another name for a DVB-RCS based satellite network. 

         

     3. MIB Module overview 

        This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the 
        management of SatLabs-compliant RCST.  The specification is 
        derived from the parameters and protocols described in 
        [SATLABS]. 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following OBJECT 
        IDENTIFIER values as already assigned by IANA under the smi-
        numbers registry [IANA]:

        These values have been assigned for this MIB under the 'mib-
        2.transmission' subtree. 

     3.1. Textual Conventions 

        This MIB module defines new textual conventions for RCST 
        indications of SatLabs defined capabilities, including profiles, 
        options and optional features. 

        DvbRcsSystemSatLabsProfileMap represents the SatLabs profiles 
        supported as defined in [SATLABS]. 

        DvbRcsSystemSatLabsOptionMap represents the SatLabs options 
        supported as defined in [SATLABS]. These are options that are 
        used for the certification of SatLabs terminals. They represent 
        important functionality, with impact on interoperability, and 
        their support is advertised with the RCST certification level. 

        DvbRcsSystemSatLabsFeatureMap represents the SatLabs optional 
        features supported as defined in [SATLABS]. These represent 
        minor features, not necessary for interoperability. They are not 
        used for the certification of SatLabs terminals. 

     3.2. Structure of the MIB 

        This MIB module is structured into two top level groups: 

        o  The dvbRcsMibObjects group includes all the managed objects 
           of the DVB-RCS MIB. 

        o  The dvbRcsConformance group includes the compliance 
           statements for DVB-RCS terminals that are compliant with 
           [SATLABS]. The managed objects are grouped into formal object 
           groups (i.e. units of conformance) according to the relation 
           to specific SatLabs options or features. The conformance 
           statements (MODULE-COMPLIANCE specification) are described 
           within the dvbRcsRcstCompliances group while the units of 
           conformance are described within the dvbRcsRcstGroups group.

        The dvbRcsMibObjects group is further structured into three 
        groups: dvbRcsRcst, dvbRcsFwdLink and dvbRcsRtnLink. 

        The dvbRcsRcst group covers management related to the RCST 
        equipment. It is structured into six groups: 

        o  dvbRcsRcstSystem 

        o  dvbRcsRcstNetwork 

        o  dvbRcsRcstInstall 

        o  dvbRcsRcstQos 

        o  dvbRcsRcstControl 

        o  dvbRcsRcstState 

        The dvbRcsFwdLink group covers management information related to 
        the RCST forward link. It is structured into two groups: 

        o  dvbRcsFwdConfig 

        o  dvbRcsFwdStatus 

        The dvbRcsRtnLink group covers management information related to 
        the RCST return link. It is structured into two groups: 

        o  dvbRcsRtnConfig 

        o  dvbRcsRtnStatus 

        Tables within each of these groups cover different functions 
        like return link traffic management (packet classes, Request 
        Classes, PID pools) and forward links configuration and status.   

        Rows created automatically (e.g., by the device according to the 
        hardware configuration) may and generally will have a mixture of 
        configuration and status objects within them.  Rows that are 
        meant to be created by the management station are generally 
        restricted to configuration (read-create) objects. 

     3.3. Relationship to the Interfaces MIB Module 

        This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB module to 
        the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863]. Several areas of correlation are 
        addressed in the following. The implementer is referred to the

        Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general 
        intent of these areas. 

        IANA has assigned three ifType labels for DVB-RCS. Each RCST 
        MUST support at least the three following interfaces:  

        o  dvbRcsMacLayer (239), -- DVB-RCS MAC Layer 

          DVB-RCS MAC Layer represents the complete air interface of an 
          RCST, as specified in [ETSI-RCS]. This interface supports star 
          and mesh networks and is bi-directional. Only star networks 
          are considered by the present MIB module. 

        o  dvbTdm (240), -- DVB Satellite TDM 

          DVB-RCS Physical link based on Time Division Multiplexing. It 
          corresponds to the forward link of a RCS transparent system or 
          the downlink of a RCS regenerative system. It is based on 
          either DVB-S or DVB-S2 standard specified in [ETSI-DVBS] and 
          [ETSI-DVBS2]. Only transparent systems are considered by the 
          present MIB module. 

          In the DVB-RCS context, this interface is uni or bi-
          directional. 

          In the present MIB module, only a uni-directional (i.e. 
          forward link, or downstream) dvbTdm interface is considered. 

        o  dvbRcsTdma (241), -- DVB-RCS TDMA 

          DVB-RCS Physical link based on Time Division Multiple Access. 
          It corresponds to the return or mesh link of a RCS transparent 
          system or the uplink of a RCS regenerative system. It is based 
          on the DVB-RCS standard specified in [ETSI-RCS]. 

          In the context of star transparent and mesh regenerative DVB-
          RCS systems, this interface is uni-directional. 

          In the context of mesh transparent DVB-RCS systems, this 
          interface is bi-directional. 

          Only star transparent systems are considered by the present 
          MIB module (i.e. return link, or upstream). 

        The protocol stack (as reflected in ifStackTable) will be as 
        follows:

        An additional Ethernet interface is used on the LAN side of the 
        RCST (see Figure 1). 

        An instance of ifEntry exists for each dvbTdm interface, for 
        each dvbRcsTdma (normally only one), and for each dvbRcsMac 
        layer (normally only one). 

        The interface counters relate to: 

        o  dvbRcsMacLayer: DVB-RCS two-way MAC interface that counts 
           aggregate Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) frames, Generic 
           Stream Encapsulation (GSE) encapsulated PDUs (equals IP 
           packets),  and ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) frames. 

        MPE is specified in [ETSI-DAT] and is transported over MPEG, 
        which is specified in [ISO-MPEG]. MPEG is transported over GS or 
        TS (Transport Stream) carriers. The TS carrier is specified in 
        [ETSI-DVBS] for DVB-S and [ETSI-DVBS2] for DVB-S2. 

        GSE is specified in [ETSI-GSE] and is transported over the GS 
        (Generic Stream) carrier, which is specified in [ETSI-DVBS2]. 

        ATM is specified in [ITU-ATM]. 

        AAL5 is specified in [ITU-AAL5]. 

        o  dvbTdm: The DVB-RCS TDM interface that counts MPEG TS packets 
           at stream level, if the TS format is used. If the Generic 
           Stream (GS) format is used, it counts GSE packets. 

        o  dvbRcsTdma: The DVB-RCS TDMA interface that counts aggregate 
           ATM and MPEG TS packets.

        The ifStackTable [RFC2863] MUST be implemented to identify the 
        relationships among sub-interfaces. 

        The following example is a DVB-RCS star network with DVB-S and 
        DVB-RCS. As illustrated on Figure 3, it shows a DVB-RCS MAC 
        interface with one downstream and one upstream interface. In 
        this network, ATM encapsulation is used in the DVB-RCS uplink. 
        Two ATM Logical Ports are shown. DVB-S2 or DVB-S can be used in 
        the downlink. 

        ifType 214 'mpegTransport' can also be used for counting TS 
        packets and bytes for subinterfaces of dvbRcsTdma or dvbTdm, 
        e.g. per PID oriented or per TS oriented as desired and 
        applicable.

        As can be seen from this example, the dvbRcsMacLayer interface 
        is layered on top of the downstream and upstream interfaces, and 
        the upstream interface is layered on top of upstream ATM logical 
        links.

     3.4. MIB groups description 

     3.4.1. dvbRcsRcstSystem 

        The MIB objects in this group gather some basic information that 
        would allow anyone to trace the history - the life - of the RCST 
        as well as to get a complete description of its constitution on 
        the component point of view, including the SatLabs 
        options/features support statement. Many of the parameters will 
        be defined at installation.  

        This group contains description parameters related to the RCST 
        type (ODU type) and location. These parameters are believed to 
        stay unchanged once it has been defined during installation. 
        Modification of hardware equipment, maintenance operations and 
        geographical re-location may require an update of those MIB 
        objects. Note that dvbRcsRcstSystem. dvbRcsSystemLocation object 
        gives the location of the ODU antenna, which is needed for 
        network operation, while the system.sysLocation (MIB-II SNMP 
        OID) provides the location of the IDU unit, which can not be 
        used for the same purpose. 

        The RCST must provide either Read-Write access to 
        dvbRcsSystemOdu parameters or, alternatively, provide the list

        of supported devices through the rcstOduListGroup (see 
        conformance section). This group of parameters, defined in 
        dvbRcsRcstSystem group, allows the selection by the RCST 
        installer of the actual ODU type. In such a case, the installer 
        must set dvbRcsOduTxType, dvbRcsOduRxType and 
        dvbRcsOduAntennaType according to the selected BUC, LNB and 
        antenna respectively. 

     3.4.2. dvbRcsRcstNetwork 

        This group contains all the MIB objects related to network 
        parameters. 

        In this subgroup, two objects have been defined in order to 
        differentiate between control and user traffic and associate 
        them with a physical interface. Both dvbRcsRcstNetwork. 
        dvbRcsNetworkLanIpAddress (Traffic) and dvbRcsRcstNetwork. 
        dvbRcsNetworkOamIpAddress (OAM) provide the value of the IP 
        address of, respectively, the user traffic and the control and 
        management traffic. 

     3.4.3. dvbRcsRcstInstall 

        This group contains all the information related to the RCST 
        installation and commissioning. Many parameters are believed to 
        stay unchanged once it has been defined during installation. 
        Modification of hardware equipment, maintenance operations and 
        geographical re-location may require an update of those MIB 
        objects. 

     3.4.4. dvbRcsRcstQos 

        This group contains objects to configure the Quality of Service 
        (QoS) of the RCST by the NCC.  

        The dvbRcsPktClass table defines the packet classification for 
        IP layer 3 classifications. Each dvbRcsPktClass entry is mapped 
        to a dvbRcsPhbEntry in the dvbRcsPhbMappingTable. 

        The dvbRcsPhbMappingTable makes the relation between a packet 
        classification entry, a Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) identifier and a 
        Request class entry. 

        The dvbRcsRequestClassTable defines all the layer 2 DVB-RCS QoS 
        parameters.

     3.4.5. dvbRcsRcstControl 

        This MIB group contains objects a network manager can use to 
        invoke actions and tests supported by the RCST agent and to 
        retrieve the action/test results. 

     3.4.6. dvbRcsRcstState 

        This MIB group describes the fault state, software versions and 
        configuration file versions of the RCST. 

     3.4.7. dvbRcsFwdLink (dvbRcsFwdConfig and dvbRcsFwdStatus groups) 

        This MIB group contains parameters that enable the NCC to have 
        access to data about the forward link. 

        Configuration information is kept into the dvbRcsFwdLink. 
        dvbRcsFwdConfig subgroup. Status information is kept into the 
        dvbRcsFwdLink.dvbRcsFwdStatus subgroup. 

        The information in 
        dvbRcsFwdLink.dvbRcsFwdConfig.dvbRcsFwdStartTable is used for 
        the first time the RCST tries to acquire the forward link. All 
        these objects values are aligned with the Satellite Delivery 
        System Descriptor in the Network Information Table (NIT) table 
        [ETSI-SI]. 

        The objects in the 
        dvbRcsFwdLink.dvbRcsFwdConfig.dvbRcsFwdStatusTable are aligned 
        with the satellite forward path descriptor form the RCS Map 
        Table (RMT) [ETSI-RCS] and with the Physical Layer (PL) Header 
        [ETSI-DVBS2], which specified the MODCOD (modulation and FEC 
        rate) and the Type (frame length short of long and the 
        presence/absence of pilots). 

     3.4.8. dvbRcsRtnLink (dvbRcsRtnConfig and dvbRcsRtnStatus groups) 

        This MIB group contains parameters that enable the NCC to have 
        access to data about the return link. 

        Configuration information is kept into the dvbRcsRtnLink. 
        dvbRcsRtnConfig subgroup. Status information is kept into the 
        dvbRcsRtnLink.dvbRcsrtnStatus subgroup. 

        The RCST is only able to deal with one return link at a time. 
        Hence, there is no need to define a table to collect the 
        different SNMP objects, as it is done for the forward.

     5. Security Considerations 

        This MIB module relates to a system that allows end-users to 
        access a private network or public internet access.  As such, 
        improper manipulation of the MIB objects represented by this MIB 
      
      
     Combes             Expires April 22, 2010              [Page 102]

        module may result in denial of service to a large number of end-
        users. 

        There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB 
        module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create. Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments. The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations. These are the tables and 
        objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 

        o  The use of the dvbRcsNetworkNccMgtInetAddress object to 
           specify management stations is considered only limited 
           protection and does not protect against attacks that spoof 
           the management station's IP address.  The use of stronger 
           mechanisms, such as SNMPv3 security, should be considered, 
           where possible. 

        o  The dvbRcsSystemOdu objects, dvbRcsCtrlCwEnable, 
           dvbRcsRtnConfigMaxEirp, dvbRcsRtnConfigDefIfLevel objects and 
           dvbRcsRcstInstall sub-tree can, if improperly or maliciously 
           used, lead to unwanted emissions or emission levels on the 
           satellite uplink, thereby resulting in potential degradation 
           of the RCS service or other services using the frequency band 
           being used. 

        o  The RCST may have its configuration file changed by the 
           actions of the management system using a combination of the 
           following objects: dvbRcsNetworkInstallLogFileDownloadUrl, 
           dvbRcsCtrlDownloadFileCommand, 
           dvbRcsCtrlActivateConfigFileCommand or 
           dvbRcsCtrlRebootCommand. An improper configuration file 
           download may result in substantial vulnerabilities and the 
           loss of the ability of the management system to control the 
           satellite terminal.  

        o  Setting dvbRcsNetworkLogFileUploadUrl to a wrong address may 
           potentially impact debugging/troubleshooting efforts. 

        o  Setting objects in dvbRcsPktClassTable could cause 
           significant changes to default traffic filtering on a RCST. 

        Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
        possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when 
      
      
     Combes             Expires April 22, 2010              [Page 103]

        sending them over the network via SNMP. These are the tables and 
        objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 

        o  The dvbRcsNetworkNccMgtInetAddress object may provide 
           sufficient information for attackers to spoof management 
           stations that have management access to the device. 

        o  The dvbRcsRcstCurrentSoftwareVersion object may provide hints 
           as to the software vulnerabilities of the cable device. 

        o  The object dvbRcsNetworkOamInetAddress and the table 
           dvbRcsPktClassTable may provide clues for attacking the cable 
           device and other subscriber devices. 

        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using 
        IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module. 

        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 

        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) 
        them.

        ifType numbers described in Section 3 have already been assigned

        Rev -00 

        * First draft, for comment by the community. 

        Rev -01  

        * Second draft, for comment by the community.  

        The MIB module is renamed DVBRCS-MIB to reflect that it covers 
        more than solely interface issues. 

        The MIB has been updated with 

              * a conformance section that captures the options 

              * structural changes and corrections to achieve this 

              * SYNTAX refinements where applicable 

              * UNITS declarations where applicable 

        Document reformatted to conform to I-D format conventions. 

        Rev -02  

        * Third draft, for comment by the community.  

        Update following comments received from the ipdvb list (Gorry 
        Fairhurst). 

        Rev -03 

        * Fourth draft, for comment by the community.  

        Update following comments received from Martin Stiemerling and 
        complement/corrections from the SatLabs Group.

     Internet-Draft               DVB-RCS MIB               October 2009 
         

        Corrected read-write into read-create MAXACCESS for objects in 
        requestClassTable and pidPoolTable. 

        Minor updates to correct format of tables and some MIB comments. 

        Rev -05 

        * Sixth draft 

        Addition of dvbRcs prefix to all descriptors, following request 
        from MIB doctor (according to Appendix C of RFC 4181). 

        Clarification and complements brought to ODU configuration 
        objects (see section 3.4.1), ODU structural entities definition 
        in dvbRcsRcstSystem group and conformance section. 

        Modification of the interface types usage (section 3.3) in order 
        to have alignment with Ethernet interface (dvbRcsMacLayer should 
        count link layer packets and bytes, like Ethernet does, and not 
        IP). 

        Updated copyright to reflect current IETF Trust guidelines and 
        advice from Dan Romascanu. 

        Rev -06 

        * Seventh draft 

        Updated following MIB doctor review. Adjustments based on the 
        MIB authoring guidelines from the IETF: 
        o  I-D renamed 

        o  Used name instead of number for DEFVAL where appropriate 

        o  Clarification added in the MIB module description regarding 
           persistency behavior of objects  

        o  Integer32 replaced with Unsigned32 where appropriate 

        o  Obsoleted OBJECT-TYPES (DisplayString, IpAddress) replaced 
           with SnmpAdminString, RFC 4001 and RFC 5017 TCs. Added 
           conformance statements mandating IPv4 support only. 

        o  Clarification of the conformance clauses added in the MODULE-
           COMPLIANCE description and the following GROUPs and OBJECTs 
           descriptions.

        o  Re-organization of some conformance groups. Each group now 
           refers to precise options or features. 5 new features 
           (specified through dvbRcsSystemSatLabsFeaturesDeclaration 
           object) are therefore defined: ODULIST, EXTNETWORK, 
           EXTCONTROL, EXTCONFIG, EXTSTATUS. 

        o  Clarification in the RowStatus OBJECTs description whether 
           writable objects in the dynamically created rows can change 
           value while the RowStatus object is active. 

        o  Security section expanded. 

        Rev -07 

        * Eighth draft 

        Updated following MIB doctor review. 

        o  Objects dvbRcsNetworkAirInterfaceDefaultGatewayInetAddress 
           PrefixLength, dvbRcsPrimaryDnsServerInetAddressPrefixLength, 
           dvbRcsSecondaryDnsServerInetAddressPrefixLength, 
           dvbRcsNetworkNccMgtInetAddressPrefixLength were missing. 

        o  Size limit added to Uri objects 

        o  It is now described in InetAddressObjects that they are to be 
           interpreted as defined by the corresponding 
           InetAddressObjectType. 

        o  Dscp and DscpOrAny TC from Diffserv MIB are now used. 

        o  dvbRcsPktClassSrcInetAddressType and 
           dvbRcsPktClassDstInetAddressType corrected to read-create 

        o  Syntax for dvbRcsSystemOduAntennaSize corrected to Unsigned32 

        o  Details of interpretation of dvbRcsSystemSatLabsXxDeclaration 
           objects now reside in the associated TC descriptions. 

        o  Addition of RFC3289, RFC3411, RFC4001, RFC5017 as normative 
           references. 

        Rev -08 

        * Ninth draft 

        Updated following MIB doctor review.

         o A clarification is added to the description of 
            dvbRcsPhbIdentifier object, which is an INDEX object. It 
            explains that value 0 designates the Default PHB. Therefore 
            an INDEX of 0 can be used here. The Syntax of this object is 
            also restricted to 16-bit, as explained in the description. 
            The Syntax of dvbRcsPktClassPhbAssociation object also 
            restricted accordingly.

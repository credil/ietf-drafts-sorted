Abstract

   This document gives information on an RTCP Packet Type and RTCP XR
   Block Type including associated SDP parameters for inter-destination
   media synchronization (IDMS). The RTCP XR Block Type, registered with
   IANA based on an ETSI specification, is used to collect media play-
   out information from participants in a group playing-out (watching,
   listening, etc.) a specific RTP media stream. The RTCP packet type
   specified by this document is used to distribute a summary of the
   collected information so that the participants can synchronize play-
   out.

   Typical applications for IDMS are social TV, shared service control
   (i.e. applications where two or more geographically separated users
   are watching a media stream together), distance learning, network
   quiz shows, multi-playing online games, etc.

1. Introduction

1.1. Inter-destination Media Synchronization

   Inter-destination media synchronization (IDMS) refers to the play-out
   of media streams at two or more geographically distributed locations
   in a temporally synchronized manner. It can be applied to both
   unicast and multicast media streams and can be applied to any type
   and/or combination of streaming media, such as audio, video and text
   (subtitles). [Boronat2009] provides an overview of technologies and
   algorithms for IDMS.

   IDMS requires the exchange of information on media receipt and
   playout times. It may also require signaling for the initiation and
   maintenance of IDMS sessions and groups.

   The presented RTCP specification for IDMS is independent of the used
   synchronization algorithm, which is out-of-scope of this document.

1.2. Applicability of RTCP to IDMS

   Currently, most multimedia applications make use of RTP and RTCP
   [RFC3550]. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) provides end-to-end
   network transport functions suitable for applications requiring real-
   time data transport, such as audio, video or data, over multicast or
   unicast network services. The timestamps and sequence number
   mechanisms provided by RTP are very useful to reconstruct the
   original media timing, reorder and detect some packet loss at the
   receiver side.

   The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow
   monitoring of the data delivery in a manner that is scalable to large
   multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification
   functionality.

   RTP receivers and senders provide reception quality feedback by
   sending out RTCP Receiver Report (RR) and Sender Report (SR) packets
   [RFC3550] respectively, which may be augmented by eXtended Reports
   (XR) [RFC3611]. Thus, the feedback reporting features provided by
   RTCP make QoS monitoring possible and can be used for troubleshooting
   and fault tolerance management in multicast distribution services
   such as IPTV.

   These protocols are intended to be tailored through modification
   and/or additions in order to include profile-specific information
   required by particular applications, and the guidelines on doing so
   are specified in [RFC5968].

   IDMS involves the collection, summarizing and distribution of RTP
   packet arrival and play-out times. As information on RTP packet
   arrival times and play-out times can be considered reception quality
   feedback information, RTCP becomes a promising candidate for carrying
   out IDMS, which may facilitate implementation in typical multimedia
   applications.

1.3. Applicability of SDP to IDMS

   RTCP XR [RFC3611] defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
   the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
   packets can be signaled by an application using the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].

   SDP signaling is used to set up and maintain a synchronization group
   between Synchronization Clients (SCs). This document describes two
   SDP parameters for doing this, one for the RTCP XR block type and one
   for the new RTCP packet type.

   This document also allows for a receiver to indicate a used clock
   source for synchronizing the receiver clock used in the IDMS session.
   This is also done using an SDP parameter, which is described in this
   document.

1.4. This document and ETSI TISPAN

   ETSI TISPAN [TS 183 063] has specified architecture and protocol for
   IDMS using RTCP XR exchange and SDP signaling.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Overview of IDMS operation

   This section provides a brief example of how the IDMS RTCP
   functionality is used. The section is tutorial in nature and does not
   contain any normative statements.

   Alice is watching TV in her living room. At some point she sees that
   a football game of Bob's favorite team is on. She sends him an invite
   to watch the program together. Embedded in the invitation is the link
   to the media server and a unique sync-group identifier.

   Bob, who is also at home, receives the invite on his laptop. He
   accepts Alice's invitation and the RTP client on his laptop sets up a
   session to the media server. A VoIP connection to Alice's TV is also
   set up, so that Alice and Bob can talk while watching the program.

   As is common with RTP, both the RTP client in Alice's TV as well as
   the one in Bob's laptop send periodic RTCP Receiver Reports (RR) to
   the media server. However, in order to make sure Alice and Bob see
   the events in the football game at the same time, their clients also
   periodically send an IDMS XR block to the MSAS function of the media
   server. Included in the XR blocks are timestamps on when both Alice
   and Bob have received (or played out) a particular RTP packet.

   The MSAS function in the media server calculates a reference client
   from the received IDMS XR blocks (e.g. by selecting whichever client
   received the packet the latest as the reference client). It then
   sends an RTCP IDMS packet containing the play-out information of this
   reference client to both Alice and Bob.

   In this case Bob has the slowest connection and the reference client
   therefore includes a delay similar to the one experienced by Bob.
   Upon reception of this information, Alice's RTP client can choose
   what to do with this information. In this case it decreases its play-
   out rate temporarily until it matches with the reference client play-
   out (and thus matches Bob's play-out). Another option for Alice's TV
   would be to simply pause playback until it catches up. The exact
   implementation of the synchronization algorithm is up to the client.

   Upon reception of the reference client RTCP IDMS packet, Bob's client
   does not have to do anything since it is already synchronized to the
   reference client (since it is based on Bob's delay). Note that other
   synchronization algorithms may introduce even more delay than the one
   experienced by the most delayed client, e.g. to account for delay
   variations, for new clients joining an existing synchronization
   group, etc.

4. Inter-destination media synchronization use cases

   Social TV is the combination of media content consumption by two or
   more users at different devices and locations and real-time
   communication between those users.

   An example of Social TV, is when two or more users are watching the
   same television broadcast at different devices and locations, while
   communicating with each other using text, audio and/or video.

   A skew in the media play-out of the two or more users can have
   adverse effects on their experience. A well-known use case here is
   one friend experiencing a goal in a football match well before or
   after other friend(s). Thus IDMS is required to provide play-out
   synchronization.

   Another example of Social TV is Shared Service Control, where two or
   more users experience some content-on-demand together, while sharing
   the trick-play controls (play, pause, fast forward, rewind) of the
   content on demand.

   Similar to the previous use case, without IDMS, differences in play-
   out speed and the effect of transit delay of trick-play control
   signals would desynchronize content play-out.

5. Architecture for inter-destination media synchronization

   The architecture for IDMS, which is based on a sync-maestro
   architecture [Boronat2009], is sketched below. The Synchronization
   Client (SC) and Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS)

   entities are shown as additional functionality for the RTP receiver
   and sender respectively.

   It should be noted that a master/slave type of architecture is also
   supported by having one of the SC devices also act as an MSAS. In
   this case the MSAS functionality is thus embedded in an RTP receiver
   instead of an RTP sender.

5.1. Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS)

   An MSAS collects RTP packet arrival times and play-out times from one
   or more SC(s) in a synchronization group. The MSAS summarizes and
   distributes this information to the SCs in the synchronization group
   as synchronization settings, e.g. by determining the SC with the most
   lagged play-out and using its reported RTP packet arrival time and
   play-out time as a summary.

5.2. Synchronization Client (SC)

   An SC reports RTP packet arrival times and play-out times of a media
   stream. It can receive summaries of such information, and use that to
   adjust its play-out buffer.

5.3. Communication between MSAS and SCs

   Two different message types are used for the communication between
   MSAS and SCs. For the SC->MSAS message containing the play-out
   information of a particular client, an RTCP XR Block Type is used
   (see Section 6). For the MSAS->SC message containing the
   synchronization settings instructions, a new RTCP Packet Type is
   defined in Section 7.

6. RTCP XR Block Type for IDMS

   This section describes the RTCP XR Block Type for reporting IDMS
   information on an RTP media stream. Its definition is based on
   [RFC3611]. The RTCP XR is used to provide feedback information on
   receipt times and presentation times of RTP packets to e.g. a Sender
   [RFC3611], a Feedback Target [RFC5760] or a Third Party Monitor
   [RFC3611].

   The first 64 bits form the header of the RTCP XR, as defined in
   [RFC3611]. The SSRC of packet sender identifies the sender of the
   specific RTCP packet.

   The IDMS report block consists of 7 32-bit words, with the following
   fields:

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits. It identifies the block format. Its value
   SHALL be set to 12.

   Synchronization Packet Sender Type (SPST): 4 bits. This field
   identifies the role of the packet sender for this specific eXtended
   Report. It can have the following values:

   SPST=0  Reserved For future use.

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS                   March 2011


   SPST=1  The packet sender is an SC. It uses this XR to report
   synchronization status information. Timestamps relate to the SC
   input.

   SPST=2  This setting is reserved in order to preserve compatibility
   with ETSI TISPAN [TS 183 063]. See section 12. for more information.

   SPST=3-15  Reserved For future use.

   Reserved bits (Resrv): 3 bits. These bits are reserved for future
   definition. In the absence of such a definition, the bits in this
   field MUST be set to zero and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Packet Presented NTP timestamp flag (P): 1 bit. Bit set to 1 if the
   Packet Presented NTP timestamp field contains a value, 0 if it is
   empty. If this flag is set to zero, then the Packet Presented NTP
   timestamp shall not be inspected.

   Block Length: 16 bits. This field indicates the length of the block
   in 32 bit words and shall be set to 7, as this RTCP Block Type has a
   fixed length.

   Payload Type (PT):  7 bits. This field identifies the format of the
   media payload, according to [RFC3551]. The media payload is
   associated with an RTP timestamp clock rate. This clock rate provides
   the time base for the RTP timestamp counter.

   Reserved bits (Resrv): 25 bits. These bits are reserved for future
   use and shall be set to 0.

   Media Stream Correlation Identifier: 32 bits. This identifier is used
   to correlate synchronized media streams. The value 0 (all bits are
   set "0") indicates that this field is empty. The value 2^32-1 (all

   The first 64 bits form the header of the RTCP Packet Type, as defined
   in [RFC3550]. The SSRC of packet sender identifies the sender of the
   specific RTCP packet.

   The RTCP IDMS packet consists of 6 32-bit words, with the following
   fields:

   SSRC: 32 bits. The SSRC of the media source shall be set to the value
   of the SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of the RTP
   packet to which the RTCP IDMS packet relates.

   Media Stream Correlation Identifier: 32 bits. This identifier is used
   to correlate synchronized media streams. The value 0 (all bits are
   set "0") indicates that this field is empty. The value 2^32-1 (all
   bits are set "1") is reserved for future use. The Media Stream
   Correlation Identifier maps on the SyncGroupId of the group to which
   this packet is sent.

   Packet Received NTP timestamp: 64 bits. This timestamp reflects the
   wall clock time at the reference client at the moment it received the
   first octet of the RTP packet to which this packet relates. It can be
   used by the synchronization algorithm on the receiving SC to set the
   required playout delay. The timestamp is formatted based on the NTP
   timestamp format as specified in [RFC5905]. See section 8 for more
   information on how this field is set.

   Packet Received RTP timestamp: 32 bits. This timestamp has the value
   of the RTP time stamp carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of the RTP
   packet to which the XR relates.

   Packet Presented NTP timestamp: 32 bits. This timestamp reflects the
   wall clock time at the reference client at the moment it presented
   the data contained in the first octet of the associated RTP packet to
   the user. It is based on the time format used by NTP and consists of
   the least significant 16 bits of the NTP seconds part and the most
   significant 16 bits of the NTP fractional second part.  If this field
   is empty, then it SHALL be set to 0. This field MAY be left empty if
   none or only one of the receivers reported on presentation
   timestamps.

8. Timing and NTP Considerations

   To achieve IDMS, the different receivers involved need synchronized
   clocks as a common timeline for synchronization. Depending on the
   synchronization accuracy required, different clock synchronization
   methods can be used. For social TV, synchronization accuracy should
   be achieved in order of hundreds of milliseconds. In that case,
   correct use of NTP on receivers will in most situations achieve the
   required accuracy. As a guideline, to deal with clock drift of
   receivers, receivers should synchronize their clocks at the beginning
   of a synchronized session.

   IDMS may be used for other purposes, such as synchronization of
   multiple television outputs in a single physical location, or for the
   synchronization of different networked speakers throughout a house.


Brandenburg           Expires September 7, 2011              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS                   March 2011


   Because of the stringent synchronization requirements for achieving
   good audio, a high accuracy will be needed. In this case, NTP usage
   may not be sufficient. Either a local NTP server could be setup, or
   some other more accurate clock synchronization mechanism could be
   used, such as using GPS time or the Precision Time Protocol [IEEE-
   1588].

   In this document, a new SDP parameter is introduced to signal the
   clock synchronization source or sources used or able to be used (see
   section 10). An SC can indicate which synchronization source is being
   used at the moment and the last time the SC synchronized with this
   source. An SC can also indicate any other synchronization sources
   available to it. This allows multiple SCs in an IDMS session to use
   the same or a similar clock synchronization source for their session.

   Applications performing IDMS may or may not be able to choose a
   synchronization method for the system clock. How applications deal
   with this is up to the implementation. The application might control
   the system clock, or it might use a separate application clock or
   even a separate IDMS session clock. It might also report on the
   system clock and the synchronization method used, without being able
   to change it.

9. SDP Parameter for RTCP XR IDMS Block Type

   The SDP parameter sync-group is used to signal the use of the RTCP XR
   block for inter-destination media synchronization. It is also used to
   carry an identifier for the synchronization group to which clients
   belong or will belong. This SDP parameter extends rtcp-xr-attrib as
   follows, using Augmented Backus-Naur Form [RFC5234].

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
   ; Original definition from [RFC3611], section 5.1

   xr-format =/ grp-sync ; Extending xr-format for inter-destination
   media synchronization

   grp-sync = "grp-sync" [",sync-group=" SyncGroupId]

   SyncGroupId = 1*DIGIT ; Numerical value from 0 till 4294967295

   DIGIT = %x30-39

   SyncGroupId is a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order and
   represented in decimal. SyncGroupId identifies a group of SCs for
   IDMS. It maps on the Media Stream Correlation Identifier as described
   in sections 6 and 7. The value SyncGroupId=0 represents an empty

   SyncGroupId. The value 4294967295 (2^32-1) is reserved for future
   use.

   The following is an example of the SDP attribute for IDMS

   a=rtcp-xr:grp-sync,sync-group=42

10. SDP Parameter for RTCP IDMS Packet Type

   The SDP parameter rtcp-idms is used to signal the use of the RTCP
   IDMS Packet Type for IDMS. It is also used to carry an identifier for
   the synchronization group to which clients belong or will belong. The
   SDP parameter is used as a media-level attribute during session
   setup. This SDP parameter is defined as follows, using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form [RFC5234].

   rtcp-idms  = "a=" "rtcp-idms" ":" [sync-grp] CRLF

   sync-grp   = "sync-group=" SyncGroupId

   SyncGroupId = 1*DIGIT ; Numerical value from 0 till 4294967295

   DIGIT     = %x30-39

   SyncGroupId is a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order and
   represented in decimal. SyncGroupId identifies a group of SCs for
   IDMS. The value SyncGroupId=0 represents an empty SyncGroupId. The
   value 4294967295 (2^32-1) is reserved for future use.

   The following is an example of the SDP attribute for IDMS.

   a=rtcp-idms:sync-group=42

11. SDP parameter for clock source

   The SDP parameter clocksource is used to signal the source for clock
   synchronization. This SDP parameter is specified as follows, using
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form [RFC5234].

   clocksource = "a=" "clocksource" ":" source SP [last-synced] CRLF

   source      = local / ntp / gps / gal / ptp

   local       = "local"

   ntp        = "ntp" ["=" ntp-server]

   ntp-server     =  host [ ":" port ]

   host           =  hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference

   hostname       =  *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]

   domainlabel    =  alphanum

                   / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum

   toplabel       =  ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum

   IPv4address    =  1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT

   IPv6reference  =  "[" IPv6address "]"

   IPv6address    =  hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]

   hexpart        =  hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]

   hexseq         =  hex4 *( ":" hex4)

   hex4           =  1*4HEXDIG

   A client MAY include this attribute multiple times. If multiple time
   synchronization sources were used in the past, the client MUST only
   report the 'last synced' parameter on the latest synchronization
   performed. If a client supports a specific synchronization method,
   but does not know any sources to use for synchronization, it SHOULD
   indicate the method without specifying the source. A client MAY
   indicate itself as source if it is a clock synchronization source,
   but it SHOULD do so using a publicly reachable address.

   The parameter can be used as both a session or media level attribute.
   It will normally be a session level parameter, since it is not
   directly media-related. In case of IDMS however, it can be used in
   conjunction with the rtcp-idms SDP parameter, and then it SHOULD be
   used as a media-level parameter as well.

   The meaning of 'local' is that no clock synchronization is performed.

   The 'last synced' parameter is used as an indication for the receiver
   of the parameter on the accuracy of the clock. If the indicated last
   synchronization time is very recent, this is an indication that the
   clock can be trusted to be accurate, given the method of clock
   synchronization used. If the indicated last synchronization time is
   longer ago or in the future, either the clock synchronization has
   been performed long ago, or the clock is synchronized to an incorrect
   synchronization source. Either way, this shows that the clock used
   can not be trusted to be accurate.

12. Compatibility with ETSI TISPAN

   As described in section 1.4, ETSI TISPAN has also described a
   mechanism for IDMS in [TS 183 063]. One of the main differences
   between the TISPAN document and this document is the fact that the
   TISPAN solution uses an RTPC XR block for both the SC->MSAS message
   as well as for the MSAS->SC message (by selecting different SPST-
   types), while this document specifies a new RTCP Packet Type for the
   MSAS->SC message.

   In order to maintain backward-compatibility, the RTCP XR block used
   for SC->MSAS signaling specified in this document is fully compatible
   with the TISPAN defined XR block.

   For the MSAS->SC signaling, it is recommended to use the RTCP IDMS
   Packet Type defined in this document. The TISPAN XR block with SPST=2
   MAY be used for purposes of compatibility with the TISPAN solution,
   but MUST NOT be used if all nodes involved support the new RTCP IDMS
   Packet Type.

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS                   March 2011


   The above means that the IANA registry contains two SDP parameters
   for the MSAS->SC signaling; one for the ETSI TISPAN solution and one
   for the IETF solution. This also means that if all elements in the
   SDP negotiation support the IETF solution they SHOULD use the new
   RTCP IDMS Packet Type.

13. Operational Considerations

   On Echo Cancellation:

   In the case of social TV: If the two locations have a "side channel"
   audio conference so the viewers can talk about what they are
   watching, this may cause an audio problem that will not be solved by
   just applying IDMS. The audio output of the television of one viewer
   will pass through the audio conference, and arrive at the second
   viewer out of sync with the television output of that second viewer.
   Different methods can be used to deal with this effect, e.g. using
   directional microphones to prevent this or applying echo cancellation
   to filter out the unwanted audio signals.

   On Reception vs. Presentation Timing:

   A receiver can report on different timing events, i.e. on packet
   arrival times and on playout times. A receiver SHALL report on
   arrival times and a receiver MAY report on playout times. RTP packet
   arrival times are relatively easy to report on. Normally, the
   processing and play-out of the same media stream by different
   receivers will take roughly the same amount of time. By synchronizing
   on packet arrival times, you may loose some accuracy, but it will be
   adequate for many applications, such as social TV. Also, if the
   receivers are in some way controlled, e.g. having the same buffer
   settings and decoding times, high accuracy can be achieved. However,
   if all receivers in a synchronization session have the ability to
   report on, and thus synchronize on, actual playout times, or packet
   presentation times, this may be more accurate. It is up to
   applications and implementations of this RTCP extension whether to
   implement and use this.

14. Security Considerations

   The specified RTCP XR Block Type in this document is used to collect,
   summarize and distribute information on packet reception- and playout
   -times of streaming media. The information may be used to orchestrate
   the media play-out at multiple devices.

   Errors in the information, either accidental or malicious, may lead
   to undesired behavior. For example, if one device erroneously reports
   a two-hour delayed play-out, then another device in the same


Brandenburg           Expires September 7, 2011              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS                   March 2011


   synchronization group could decide to delay its play-out by two hours
   as well, in order to keep its play-out synchronized. A user would
   likely interpret this two hour delay as a malfunctioning service.

   Therefore, the application logic of both Synchronization Clients and
   Media Synchronization Application Servers should check for
   inconsistent information. Differences in play-out time exceeding
   configured limits (e.g. more than ten seconds) could be an indication
   of such inconsistent information.

   No new mechanisms are introduced in this document to ensure
   confidentiality. Encryption procedures, such as those being suggested
   for a Secure RTP (SRTP) at the time that this document was written,
   can be used when confidentiality is a concern to end hosts.

15. IANA Considerations

   New RTCP Packet Types and RTCP XR Block Types are subject to IANA
   registration. For general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP
   XR, refer to [RFC3611].

   [TS 183 063] assigns the block type value 12 in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry to "Inter-destination Media Synchronization Block". [TS
   183 063] also registers the SDP [RFC4566] parameter "grp-sync" for
   the "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry.

   Further, this document defines a new RTCP packet type called IDMS
   report. This new packet type is registered with the IANA registry of
   RTP parameters, based on the specification in section 7.

   Further, this document defines a new SDP parameter "rtcp-idms" within
   the existing IANA registry of SDP Parameters.

   The SDP attribute "rtcp-idms" defined by this document is registered
   with the IANA registry of SDP Parameters as follows:

      SDP Attribute ("att-field"):

        Attribute name:     rtcp-idms

        Long form:          RTCP report block for IDMS

        Type of name:       att-field

        Type of attribute:  media level

        Subject to charset: no

        Reference:          this document

        Values:             see this document

   Further, this document defines a new SDP attribute, "clocksource",
   within the existing IANA registry of SDP Parameters.

   The SDP attribute "clocksource" defined by this document is
   registered with the IANA registry of SDP Parameters as follows:

      SDP Attribute ("att-field"):

        Attribute name:     clocksource

        Long form:          clock synchronization source

        Type of name:       att-field

        Type of attribute:  session level

        Subject to charset: no

        Purpose:            see sections 8 and 11 of this document

        Reference:          this document

        Values:             see this document and registrations below

   The attribute has an extensible parameter field and therefore a
   registry for these parameters is required. This document creates an
   IANA registry called the Clocksource Source Parameters Registry.  It
   contains the five parameters defined in Section 11: "local", "ntp",
   "gps", "gal" and "ptp".

16. Conclusions

   This document describes the RTCP XR block type for IDMS, the RTCP
   IDMS report and the associated SDP parameters for inter-destination
   media synchronization. It also describes an SDP parameter for
   indicating which source is used for synchronizing a (systems) (wall)
   clock.

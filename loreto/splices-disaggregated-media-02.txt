   Disaggregated media refers to the ability for a user to create a
   multimedia session combining different media streams, coming from
   different devices under his or her control, so that they are treated
   by the far end of the session as a single media session.  This
   document lists several use cases that involve disaggregated media in
   SIP.  Additionally, this document analyzes what types of
   disaggregated media can be implemented using existing protocol
   mechanisms, and the pros and cons of using each of those mechanisms.
   Finally, this document describes scenarios that are not covered by
   current mechanisms and proposes new IETF work to cover them.

Internet-Draft         Disaggregated Media in SIP          June 25, 2011


1.  Introduction

   Disaggregated media refers to the ability for a user to create a
   multimedia session combining different media streams, coming from
   different devices under his or her control, so that they are treated
   by the far end of the session as a single media session.

   The SIP specification [RFC3261] defines a multimedia session as "an
   exchange of data between an association of participants".  SDP
   (Session Description Protocol) is the default session description
   format in SIP.  The SDP (Session Description Protocol) specification
   [RFC4566] defines a multimedia session as "a set of multimedia
   senders and receivers and the data streams flowing from senders to
   receivers".

   Generally, a given participant uses a single device to establish (or
   participate in) a given multimedia session.  Consequently, the SIP
   signaling to manage the multimedia session and the actual media
   streams are typically co-located in the same device.  In scenarios
   involving disaggregated media, a user wants to establish a single
   multimedia session combining different media streams coming from
   different devices under his or her control.  This creates a need to
   coordinate the exchange of the those media streams within the media
   session.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
   contains use cases where different media streams, coming from
   different devices, are combined to establish a multimedia session.
   Section 3 describes what types of disaggregated media can be
   implemented using existing protocol mechanisms, and the pros and cons
   of using each of those mechanisms.  Section 4 describes scenarios
   that are not covered by current mechanisms and proposes new IETF work
   to cover them.


2.  Use Cases

   This section lists several use cases where users participate in a
   multimedia session using multiple devices.  That is, either the user
   initiating the session uses several devices in parallel during the
   session, or the user receiving the session invitation uses several
   devices in parallel during the session, or both.

2.1.  Using Two Separate devices to Start a Conversation

   Laura is at her office.  On her desk, she has a PC with a soft client
   and a desk phone.  The PC has a low-quality built-in microphone and
   is connected to high-quality speakers.

   Laura wants to establish a voice session with Bob using the desk
   phone as the microphone and the soft client as the speaker.

   Laura wants Bob to treat the send-only audio stream from her
   deskphone and the receive-only audio stream from her softclient as
   part of the same communication space.  That is, Laura wants Bob to
   treat both streams as belonging to the same multimedia session.

2.2.  Showing a Pre-recorded Video During a Conversation

   Bob has a voice-only phone and an IP-TV device.  Laura has an
   integrated advanced multimedia phone with camera.

   Bob is talking on his voice-only phone with Laura, who is on her
   multimedia phone.

   Bob wants to show Laura part of the TV show he recorded last night.
   Bob interacts, using his voice-only phone, with his IP-TV device and
   sends a video stream to Laura's device.

   Bob talks about the show with Laura on his voice-only phone while
   Laura watches the show.

   Bob wants Laura to treat the video stream from his IP-TV device and
   the voice stream from his voice-only phone as part of the same
   communication space.  That is, Bob wants Laura to treat both streams
   as belonging to the same multimedia session.

2.3.  Sending a File from a PC During a Conversation

   Bob has a voice-only phone and a PC with a soft client.  Laura has an
   integrated advanced multimedia phone with support for file transfers.

   Bob wants to send a file to Laura from his PC during his conversation
   with Laura on his voice-only phone.

   Bob interacts, using his voice-only phone, with his PC and starts a
   file transfer session to Laura's multimedia phone.

   Bob wants Laura to treat the file transfer from his PC and the voice
   stream from his voice-only phone as part of the same communication
   space.  That is, Bob wants Laura to treat both streams as belonging
   to the same multimedia session.

2.4.  Including Live Video in a Conversation

   Bob has a voice-only phone and a PC which has a soft client, a
   Webcam, and a low-quality built-in microphone.  Laura has an

   integrated advanced multimedia phone with camera.

   Bob wants to send a live video to Laura from his PC during his
   conversation with Laura.

   Bob interacts, using his voice-only phone, with his PC and starts
   live video stream to Laura's multimedia phone.

   Bob wants Laura to treat the live video stream from his PC and the
   voice stream from his voice-only phone as part of the same
   communication space.  That is, Bob wants Laura to treat both streams
   as belonging to the same multimedia session.

2.5.  Including Remote Live Video in a Conversation

   Bob, who is at his office, has a multimedia phone.  At his summer
   cottage, Bob has a webcam-phone (e.g. a video-surveillance system).
   Laura has an integrated advanced multimedia phone with a camera.

   During his conversation with Laura, Bob wants to show her the new
   summer cottage he just bought.  Bob interacts, using his multimedia
   phone, with his webcam phone at this summer cottage and start live
   video stream to Laura's multimedia phone.

   Bob wants Laura to treat the live video stream from his webcam-phone
   and the voice stream from his voice-only phone as part of the same
   communication space.  That is, Bob wants Laura to treat both streams
   as belonging to the same multimedia session.

2.6.  Answering a call using Two Separate Devices

   Laura has a PC with a softclient and a desk phone.  Bob has an
   integrated advanced multimedia phone with camera.

   Laura receives on her desk phone an incoming voice-video call from
   Bob.

   Laura decides to answer Bob's session invitation by establishing a
   voice session with Bob using the desk phone and the video session
   using her multimedia phone.  Two SIP dialogs need to be established:
   one between Bob's device and Laura's desk phone and one between Bob's
   device and Laura's multimedia phone.

   Laura wants Bob to treat the audio stream from her deskphone and the
   video stream from her softclient as part of the same communication
   space.  That is, Laura wants Bob to treat both streams as belonging
   to the same multimedia session.

2.7.  Other possible use cases

   This section just enumerates, for sake of completeness, other
   possible use cases, similar to the one elaborated in the previous
   sections.

   A user wants to start or answer a call combining:

   o  Voice and video streams from a deskphone and application sharing
      from a computer.
   o  Voice stream from a deskphone and video stream to/from a TV
      attached to a set top box with a camera built in.
   o  The User Interface (UI) for the call on a mobile phone and the
      audio streaming coming in/out of a speakerphone that is in the
      same room where he is.


3.  Existing Mechanisms to Implement Disaggregated Media

   Figure 1 shows the media flow in the most generic scenario where both
   the Caller and the Callee use disaggregated media, involving in the
   multimedia session different devices under their control.

               Figure 1: Media Flows in Disaggregated Media

   All existing mechanisms to implement disaggregated media in SIP use a
   centralized approach whereby the far end of the session receives the
   same SIP signaling flow that it would receive if all the media
   streams came from a single device.  This makes it transparent to the
   far end of the session the fact that the caller is using separate
   devices for different media.

                      Figure 2: Centralized scenario

   Figure 2 shows the generic signaling flow common to all centralized
   solutions, where a Central Node is able to manage all signaling
   messages needed to coordinate the different user's devices and hide
   from the far end of the session all the mechanisms used to distribute
   the media among different devices.

   Section 3.1, Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 analyze how different
   existing mechanisms can be used to implement disaggregated media in a
   centralized way.

3.1.  Message Bus (Mbus)

   The Message Bus (Mbus) [RFC3259] is a light-weight local coordination
   protocol for developing component-based distributed applications.
   Mbus provides a simple and flexible message oriented communication
   channel for a group of components that may be distributed on multiple
   hosts in a local network.  The transport services include useful
   features such as peer location, point-to-point and group
   communication and security.

   In a disaggregated media scenario a user can use Mbus to coordinate
   the different devices under his control in a loosely coupled
   conference control model and so involve them in the call.  The
   different devices can communicate with one another using Mbus
   messages, and then let only one device, a call control engine, to
   initiate, manage and terminate call control relations to other SIP
   endpoints.  In this case the fact that the caller is using separate
   devices for different media becomes transparent to the callee.

   Figure 3 shows an example of the relation between a call control
   engine in an Mbus enabled conferencing system.

                        Figure 3: MBus Architecture

3.1.1.  Mbus issues

   The Mbus protocol introduces the following issues.

   Mbus support:  All the different user's devices need to support the
      Mbus protocol.
   Central point:  Because the call control engine has a complete
      control over the call, it needs to be involved during the whole
      duration of the session.  It cannot leave the session before the
      whole session ends (unless it transfers the controller role to one
      of the other user's devices).
   Local network:  Mbus uses multicast with a limited scope for message
      transport.  The multicast limits the coordination mechanism only
      to groups of devices that are connected to a local network.  So
      Mbus can be used in a disaggregated media scenario only if all the
      different devices under the user control, or at least the one the
      user wants to involve in the communication, are attached to the
      same local network.

3.2.  Megaco (H.248)

   The Megaco [RFC3525] protocol is used to establish, and terminate
   calls across terminations (end points) connected to Media Gateways
   (MGs).  Megaco instructs Media Gateways (MG) to connect streams
   coming from outside a packet network on to a packet stream such as
   RTP.  Master-MGC issues commands to send and receive media from
   addresses, generate tones, and to modify configuration.  The
   architecture requires a Media Gateway Controller (MGC) controlling
   the Media Gateway(s).  However it does not constitute a complete
   system.  To establish communication between MGC(s) is necessary a
   session initiation protocol.  SIP is the protocol normally used to

Internet-Draft         Disaggregated Media in SIP          June 25, 2011


   establish calls across domains or across MGCs.

   Megaco can be used in a disaggregated media scenario to let one of
   the user's devices act as a Media Gateway Controller, coordinating
   all the other devices under the user's control, which in this case
   will act as Media Gateways.  In this case the fact that the caller is
   using separate devices for different media becomes transparent to the
   callee.

3.2.1.  Megaco issues

   The Megaco protocol introduces the following issues.

   Megaco support:  All the different user's devices need to support the
      Megaco protocol.
   Central point:  Because the Media Gateway Controller has a complete
      control over the call, it needs to be involved for all the session
      time.  It can not leave the session before the whole session ends.

3.3.  Third Part Call Control (3pcc)

   3pcc [RFC3725] allows one entity (called the Controller) to setup and
   manage a communications relationship between two or more other
   parties using SIP.

   In a disaggregated media scenario, a user can use 3pcc mechanism only
   if at least one among the different devices under his control
   supports this mechanism and is able to become a Controller for the
   other in the call.  In this case become transparent for the callee
   the fact that the caller is using separate devices for different
   media.  In fact the Controller is a central point for the signaling
   on the caller side, and has complete control over the call, making
   everything in one dialog for the callee.

   The call flow for disaggregated media using 3pcc is shown in
   Figure 4.  It is based on Flow IV documented in Section 4.4 of
   [RFC3725] and recommended for calls to unknown entities, or to
   entities known to represent people.  The flow requires some SDP
   manipulation by the Controller to convert offer2 to offer2' and
   offer2'', and then to convert answer2' and answer2'' to answer2.

3.3.1.  3pcc issues

   The 3pcc mechanism introduces the following issues.

   Complexity:  Third party call control only uses protocol mechanism
      specified in [RFC3261].  However the usage of third party call
      control becomes more complex when aspects of the call utilize SIP
      extensions or optional features of SIP like resource reservation.

   Central point:  Because the Controller has a complete control over
      the call, it needs to be involved during the whole duration of the
      session.  It cannot leave the session before the whole session
      ends (unless it transfers the controller role to one of the other
      user's devices).
   User experience:  3ppc results in a suboptimal user experience
      because the slave phones are not aware that they are involved in a
      disaggregated media call scenario.  Indeed, the slave phones
      behave as they were just involved in a normal call with the
      Controller.  Moreover the slave phones will be alerted without any
      media having been established yet.
   SDP manipulation:  the Controller cannot "proxy" the SIP messages
      received from one of the parties.  In many cases, it is required
      to modify the SDP exchanged between the participants in order to
      affect the changes.


4.  Distributed Call Control with Actions

   The loosely coupled scenarios in this section describe the discovery
   of capabilities and interaction between the federated devices that
   allows these devices to present themselves to the remote party as one
   entity.

   The federated devices utilize the Actions mechanism to allow a UA to
   invoke an action on another UA.

   3PCC allows the Controller to setup and manage a communications
   relationship between two or more other parties using SIP.  When 3PCC
   is coupled with the Actions mechanism, the Controller role becomes
   flexible enough to allow any of the federated parties to take that
   role at any time, depending on the specifics of the use case.

   All federated devices are expected to be aware of each others
   capabilities and all available actions, and they are also expected to
   be aware of all the dialogs of each others by subscribing to the
   'dialog' event package, and have the intelligence to utilize all this
   knowledge to provide solutions to a wide range of use cases, without
   requiring the remote party to change.

   Because there is no one entity that takes the Controller role all the
   time, in the event of a sudden departure of one of the federated
   devices, one of the remaining devices can take control of the
   communication with the remote party and update it, based on the
   capabilities of the remaining federated parties. In the case of the
   departure of the Controller device and with multiple federated
   devices still alive, the rest of the federated devices can utilize
   the Actions mechanism to select the new Controller.

4.1.  Answering an A/V call using Two Separate Devices example

   This section describes the example use case of answering an incoming
   A/V call using two separate devices, using the mechanism described in
   the section above.  In the following example flows the Actions
   mechanism used is the one provided by the proposed new SIP INVOKE
   method.  The use case has Alice with a PC with a Video SIP UA and
   Audio SIP Desk Phone while Bob has an integrated SIP Device with A/V.

4.1.1.  Discovery of Capabilities

   Both Alice's devices subscribe to the 'reg' event package of each
   other, which allows each device to discover the capabilities of the
   other device based on the feature tags provided by each device.  The
   Desk Phone knows that the PC supports Video, while the PC knows that
   the Desk Phone only supports audio.  The two devices also subscribe
   to the 'dialog' event package of each other.

4.1.2.  Answering Using PC

   Bob makes an A/V call to Alice, which rings both of Alice's devices.
   Alice answered the call using her PC.  The PC instructs the phone to
   answer the call with audio only, and then the PC joins the existing
   call with video, by sending an INVITE with Join to the phone, which
   will then take the Video offer from the PC and add its Audio offer
   and send a re-INVITE with an SDP with one audio media line and one
   video media line.

4.1.4.  Departure of One Device

   In the case of a sudden departure of one of the devices, the other
   device can take control over the communication with the remote party.

   In the flow below, Alice's devices have a keep-alive mechanism that
   allows each one of them to discover if the other is gone (the
   mechanism is TBD).  Let us assume that the PC discovers that the
   phone is gone.  The PC is aware of the dialog with Bob because of the
   subscription to the dialog event package.  The PC then clears
   dialog2, and sends an INVITE with Replaces to Bob's phone to replace
   the dialog with the phone.

   The above mechanism has its limitation, as the PC, in this case, must
   be able to discover that the other federated device is gone and
   replace the dialog between the Desk Phone and the remote phone before
   Bob's phone tears down the dialog with the Desk Phone (dialog1).

5.  Scenarios Not Covered by Existing Mechanisms

   As discussed previously, all existing mechanisms implement
   disaggregated media using a centralized approach.  Scenarios not
   covered by existing mechanisms include those where none of the nodes
   can act as a controller because it does not support the necessary
   functionality or because it will not participate in the whole session
   (transferring the SIP dialog from a controller to a new one using
   REFER and Replaces is complex and requires support from the far end).
   These scenarios are better implemented using a more distributed
   approach.

   In a distributed scenario, the far end of the session receives
   directly signaling messages from each of the devices involved in the
   multimedia session.  That means that the receiver needs to treat all
   the signaling and media coming from different devices of the same
   user as part of the same media session.

   Figure 5 shows the generic signaling flow in a Distributed Scenario,
   where all the signaling messages go from the different user's devices
   to the far end of the session.


6.  Recommendations

   To maximize the possibility of the adoption of this mechanism, we
   recommend that the WG take the Distributed Call Control with Actions
   approach defined in section 4 above.

   A future work may learn from the experience we gain with the
   Distributed Call Control with Actions approach and later try to
   standardize the approach described in section 5 above.

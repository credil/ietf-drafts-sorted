  <abstract> 

    <t>Documents intended to be shared among multiple constituencies must
    share a common format and transport mechanism. The Incident Object
    Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for
    document exchange, and Realtime Internetwork Defense (RID) defines
    extensions to IODEF intended for the cooperative handling of security
    incidents within consortia of network operators and enterprises. This
    document outlines the transport of IODEF and RID messages over
    HTTP/TLS.</t>

  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro-sec">

  <t>The <xref target="RFC5070">Incident Object Description Exchange Format
  (IODEF)</xref> describes an XML document format for the purpose of
  exchanging data between Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)
  or those responsible for security incident handling for network providers
  (NPs). The defined document format provides an easy way for CSIRTs to
  exchange data in a way which can be easily parsed.</t>

  <t>IODEF defines a message format, not a transport protocol, as the sharing
  of messages is assumed to be out of scope in order to allow CSIRTs to
  exchange and store messages in a way most suited to their established
  incident handling processes. However, extensions such as <xref
  target="I-D.moriarty-post-inch-rid">Real-time Inter-network Defense
  (RID)</xref> do require a specification of a transport protocol to ensure
  interoperability among members in a RID consortium. This document specifies
  the transport of RID messages within <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref>
  Request and Response messages transported over <xref
  target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> (herein, HTTP/TLS). Note that any IODEF
  message may also be transported using this mechanism, by sending it as a RID
  Report message.</t>

  <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology-sec">

    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
    target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Transmission of RID Messages over HTTP/TLS"
  anchor="rid-https-sec">

    <t>This section specifies the details of the transport of RID messages
    over HTTP/TLS. In this arrangement, each RID server is both an HTTP/TLS
    server and an HTTP/TLS Client. When a RID message must be sent, the
    sending RID system connects to the receiving RID system and sends the
    message, optionally receiving a message in reply. All RID systems MUST be
    prepared to accept HTTP/TLS connections from any RID peer with which it
    communicates, in order to support callback for delayed replies (see
    below).</t>

    <t><xref target="RFC3205">BCP 56</xref> contains a number of important
    considerations when using HTTP for application protocols. These include
    the size of the payload for the application, whether the application will
    use a web browser, whether the protocol should be defined on a port other
    than 80, and if the security provided through HTTP/TLS suits the needs of
    the new application.</t>

    <t>It is acknowledged within the scope of these concerns that HTTP/TLS is
    not ideally suited for RID transport, as the former is a client-server
    protocol and the latter a message-exchange protocol; however, the ease of
    implementation of RID systems over HTTP/TLS outweighs these concerns.
    Consistent with BCP 56, RID systems will listen for TCP connections on
    port [IANA NOTE: assigned port goes here]. Every RID system participating
    in a consortium MUST listen for HTTP/TLS connections on the assigned
    port.</t>

    <t>All RID messages sent in HTTP Requests MUST be sent using the POST
    with a Request-URI of /; additional Request-URI paths are reserved for
    future use by RID.</t>

    <t>The following table lists the allowable RID message types in an HTTP
    Response for a given RID message type in the Request. A RID system MUST be
    prepared to handle an HTTP Response of the given type(s) when sending the
    corresponding HTTP Request. A RID system MUST NOT send an HTTP Response
    containing any RID message other than the one corresponding to the one
    sent in the HTTP Request.</t>

    <t>As the queries and replies in a RID message exchange may be
    significantly separated in time, the receiving RID system MAY return 202
    Accepted, terminate the connection, and connect to the requesting RID
    system and sending the RID reply in an HTTP Request at a later time. This
    mechanism is referred to in this document as "RID callback". When
    performing RID callback, a responding system MUST connect to the network-
    and transport-layer addresses from which the original request was sent;
    there is no mechanism in RID for redirected callback.</t>

    <t>While a RID system SHOULD return the reply in an HTTP Response if it
    is available immediately or within a generally accepted HTTP client time
    out (about thirty seconds), this is not mandatory, and as such RID systems
    MUST be prepared for a query to be met with a 202 Accepted, an empty
    Response body, a connection termination and a callback.</t>

    <t>RID systems accepting a callback message in an HTTP Request MUST
    return 202 Accepted.</t>

    <t>The following table lists the allowable request/response pairs for
    RID.</t>

    <t>For security purposes, RID systems SHOULD NOT return 3xx Redirect
    response codes, and MUST NOT follow any 3xx Redirect. When a RID System's
    address changes, contact point information within the consortium must be
    updated out of band.</t>

    <t>If a RID system receives an improper RID message in an HTTP
    Request, it MUST return an appropriate 4xx Client Error result code to the
    requesting RID system. If a RID system cannot process a RID message
    received in an HTTP Request due to an error on its own side, it MUST
    return an appropriate 5xx Server Error result code to the requesting RID
    system.</t>

    <t>Note that HTTP provides no mechanism for signaling to a server than
    a response body is improper. If an RID system receives and improper RID
    message in an HTTP Response, or cannot process a RID message received
    in an HTTP Response due to an error on its own side, it MUST log the
    error and present it to the RID system administrator for handling; the
    error logging format is an implementation detail and is considered out of
    scope for this specification.</t>

    <t>RID systems MUST support and SHOULD use HTTP/1.1 persistent connections
    as described in <xref target="RFC2616"/> to minimize TCP connection setup
    overhead. RID systems MUST support chunked transfer encoding on the HTTP
    server side to allow the implementation of clients that do not need to
    precalculate message sizes before constructing HTTP headers.</t>

    <t>RID systems MUST use TLS for confidentiality, identification, and
    strong mutual authentication as in <xref target="RFC2818"/>; see <xref
    target="security-sec"/> below for details.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security-sec">

    <t>All security considerations of related documents MUST be considered,
    especially the <xref target="RFC5070">Incident Object Description Exchange
    Format (IODEF)</xref> and <xref
    target="I-D.moriarty-post-inch-rid">Real-time Inter-network Defense
    (RID)</xref>. The transport described herein is built on the foundation of
    these documents; the security considerations contained therein are
    incorporated by reference.</t>

    <t>For transport confidentiality, identification, and authentication, TLS
    with mutual authentication MUST be used to secure the HTTP connection as
    in <xref target="RFC2818"/>. Each RID consortium SHOULD use a trusted
    public key infrastructure (PKI) to manage identities dor RID systems
    participating in TLS connections. At minimum, each RID system MUST trust a
    set of X.509 Issuer identities ("Certificate Authorities") to authenticate
    RID system peers with which it is willing to exchange information, and/or
    a specific white list of X.509 Subject identities of RID system peers
    directly.</t>

    <t>RID systems SHOULD additionally verify the fully qualified domain name
    (FQDN) of a connected RID system peer against the presented Subject
    identity. The fully qualified domain name used to identify a RID system
    may be stored either in a subjectAltName extension of type dNSName, or in
    the most specific Common Name field of the Subject identity of the RID
    system's X.509 certificate. Internationalized FQDNs MUST be encoded using
    <xref target="RFC3492">Punycode</xref>. If both a Common Name and
    subjectAltName FQDN are present, the subjectAltName is to be given
    preference.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana-sec">

    <t>Consistent with <xref target="RFC3205">BCP 56</xref>, since RID over
    HTTP/TLS is a substantially new service, and should be controlled at the
    consortium member network's border differently than HTTP/TLS, it requires
    a new port number. IANA has assigned port [IANA NOTE: assign port number
    here] to RID over HTTP/TLS.</t>

2.  Use Cases

   Developing use cases for a network security protocol is a developing
   art.  Should the use cases be speficied from the point of view of the
   client or the server?  How does the threat model tie in?

   In this document we begin by classifying attackers according to their
   capabilities.  The use cases are then developed from the point of
   view of the client and the server.

2.1.  Attack Model

   The asset to be protected is information.  Information assets are
   subject to Confidentiality Integrity and Service risks.

   For breivty, service risks are not addressed directly, although it
   should be noted that many controls to mitigate Denial of Service
   attacks are possible if a client can establish a secure connection to
   a trustworthy DNS service.

2.1.1.  Eve the Evesdropper: Confidentiality

   [A-EVE] Eve has the ability to read communications between the
   parties but cannot modify them.

   Eve typically observes traffic by evesdropping on wireless
   connections or other brodcast hops but may also have access to the
   cabling through which the signals run.

Internet-Draft       DANE Use Cases and Requirements          April 2011


2.1.2.  Simon DNS Spoofer: Integrity

   [A-DNS] Simon the spoofer can control the DNS service responses for a
   domain.  Simon's attacks may affect the entire Internet or be limited
   in scope.

   Simon employs a range of techniques to achieve DNS spoofing on a
   local level.  His favorites being cache poisoning and capture of DNS
   resolvers.  He also uses malware attacks that redirect DNS resolution
   on an infected host or possibly by redirection of a local DNS
   forwarder at an unsecured network access point.  While such attacks
   are limited in scope, this may actually be preferable since limited
   scope attacks are more likely to escape detection for an extended
   period of time.

   On occasion Simon has redirected DNS domains across the entire
   Internet through attacks on the registry and/or registrar
   infrastructure.  Such attacks frequently involve social engineering

2.1.3.  Denis the Denier of Service: Service

   [A-DENY] Denis the denier of service can prevent the parties from
   communicating on some but not all communication channels and/or
   routes.

   Denis has used a wide range of techniques to effect his attacks
   including SYN flooding, BGP level attacks and on occasion
   disconnecting Internet service for an entire country.  Denis has also
   been known to be extremely careless with a backhoe.

2.1.4.  Ulma, the Untrustworthy Third Party

   [A-UCA] Ulma is an Untrustworthy Third Party whose root signature key
   is configured to be trusted by default.

   Opinions on Ulma vary.  Some say that she is trying her best, others
   worry that her best may not be good enough, others still worry that
   Ulma is intentionally acting in bad faith.

2.1.5.  Mallet the Man-in-the-Middle: Confidentiality + Integrity +
        Service

   [A-MALLET] Mallet is the man in the middle, the attacker who can
   control every aspect of a communication.

   While the activities of Eve, Simon or Ulma may ultimately lead to a
   successful man in the middle attack, Mallet has the ability to
   perform such attacks a-priori.  He does this by techniques such as

Internet-Draft       DANE Use Cases and Requirements          April 2011


   BGP spoofing and compromise of infrastructure such as hubs and
   routers.

2.2.  Server Use Cases (Alice)

   [P-Alice] Alice is the administrator of Internet services for a wide
   variety of customers with very different security needs (and
   willingness to pay for her services).

   Some customers want Alice to install and deploy a service as quickly
   and simply as possible with minimal concern for security.

   Other customers have more demanding security needs and Alice must
   meet these as well.

2.2.1.  Server Types

2.2.1.1.  Human/Machine Interaction: Web Browser

   A Web Server that is primarily intended to support human-machine
   interaction MAY permit the display of a security signal in some
   circumstances.

2.2.1.2.  Human/Machine Interaction: Other

   Other protocols that are primarily intended to support human-machine
   interaction MAY permit the display of a security signal in some
   circumstances but the support for such signals is poorly defined.

2.2.1.3.  Web Service / Internet Service

   A service that is primarily designed to support machine/machine
   interaction. for example delivery of SMTP messages from an outgoing
   to an incoming mail server, Web Services of all types, etc.

   Since there is no user in such cases, there is no party to read or
   interpert a UI security signal.

2.2.2.  Administrative Use Cases

2.2.2.1.  Trusted Third Party Restriction

   [U-S-TRUST] Having noted the behavior of Ulma and the risk of
   compromise due to [A-UCA], Alice wishes to ensure that the only
   certificates that are issued for a domain or accepted by applications
   are those issued by Carol [P-CAROL]

Internet-Draft       DANE Use Cases and Requirements          April 2011


2.2.2.2.  Single Service

   [U-S-SINGLE] Alice is deploying a single service in a domain and
   wishes to do so with minimal effort.

2.2.2.3.  Multiple Services

   [U-S-MULTIPLE] Alice is deploying many services in a domain and is
   more concerned with the stability and long-term maintenance of the
   systems.

2.2.2.4.  Rapid Configuration Changes

   [U-S-RAPID] Alice is deploying many services in a domain with rapidly
   changing configuration demands.

   For example, Alice is supporting a Web site that has greatly varying
   capacity requirements throughout the day.  A single server is
   sufficient to meet demand for most of the day but at peak times
   demand can rapidly grow to 16 servers or more.  Alice meets these
   requirements by renting services in the cloud in response to current
   needs.

2.2.2.5.  [U-S-ALIAS] Service Mapping

   [U-S-ALIAS1] Alice has been asked to change the name of a Web site
   from www.example.net to www.example.com so that a single server can
   support both sites without the need for separate management.

   [U-S-ALIAS2] Although the official name for the Web site is
   www.example.com, many users rely on the autocomplete feature in most
   Web browsers and only type in example.com and this can lead to
   performance issues.

   Service mappings through use of CNAME and/or internal HTTP redirects
   on a Web server are a frequent administrative requirement.

2.2.2.6.  [U-S-DEFAULT] Default Service

   [U-S-DEFAULT] Alice has been asked to ensure that a visitor
   attempting to connect to a Web site with any domain name in or under
   example.com will always succeed, even if the corresponding DNS name
   is empty.

2.3.  Client Use Cases

   Bob [P-BOB] is a human who uses a range of Web sites, Web Services
   and Internet services with different security requirements.



Hallam-Baker             Expires October 9, 2011                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       DANE Use Cases and Requirements          April 2011


   In some cases Bob makes use of a Web Service that will in turn make
   service requests on his behalf, acting as an Intelligent Agent
   [P-IA].

2.3.1.  Verify DNS Identity

   [U-C-DNSID-BOB] Bob has used the site example.com for many years and
   trusts the site maintainer.  How can Bob ensure that he has connected
   to the real 'example.conm'?

   [U-C-DNSID-IA] Similar to [U-C-DNSID-BOB] above, the Intelligent
   Agent is preconfigured through an out-of-band mechanism to trust a
   Web Service offered by a particular DNS domain.

2.3.2.  Establish Trust

   [U-C-TRUST-BOB] Bob is looking for an Internet source supplying
   widgest.  He discovers such a site through a Web search engine that
   does meet his trust criteria but Bob is not aware that this is the
   case.  How can Bob determine that he can trust the Web site he has
   found with his credit card details?

   [U-C-TRUST-IA]Similar to [U-C-TRUST-BOB] above, but the transaction
   is to be handled by the Intelligent agent.

2.3.3.  Establish Un-Trust

   [U-C-UNTRUST] In the converse of [U-C-TRUST-BOB], the Web site found
   does not meet Bob's trust criteria.  How can Bob distinguish this
   case from the case where his criteria are met?

   [U-C-UNTRUST-IA]Similar to [U-C-UNTRUST] above, but the transaction
   is to be handled by the Intelligent agent.

2.3.4.  Best Connection

   [U-C-BEST] Bob connects to a Web site.  Bob wants connections to the
   example.com Web site to be 'as secure as possible'.

2.3.5.  User Presence

   [U-C-ACCOUNT] TBS

2.3.6.  Secure Email

   [U-C-EMAIL] TBS

3.  Constraints

3.1.  DNS Size Constraints

   [C-SIZE] DNS responses must fit into a single IP packet if TCP
   fallback is to be avoided and such mackets must be smaller than the
   path MTU if fragmentation is to be avoided.

   While some of the worst consequences of this restriction have been
   mitigated through EDNS(0), use of DNSSEC and in particular the need
   to attach DNS SIG records for each recordset mean that its
   consequences cannot be entirely ignored.

3.2.  DNSSEC Deployment

   [C-DNSSEC] DNSSEC is only partially deployed.  While DNSSEC is
   deployed at most DNS TLDs, deployment has not been effected in many
   TLDs.  Moreover in some TLDs where DNSSEC is 'deployed' it is only
   supported by the registry and not by registrars.

3.3.  DNS Prefixing

   [C-PREFIX] The practice of using prefixes to DNS names to allow
   protocol and/or service specific properties to be specified is not
   fully interoperable with existing practices for using aliases or
   wildcards.

   As far as the DNS infrastructure is concerned, a DNS name that
   incorporates a prefix is no different from any other DNS name and
   that creates problems for DNS administration since it is generally
   desirable that wildcards and aliases apply to all protocol properties
   associated with a domain name, including those expressed using a
   prefix.

   The DNS infrastructure does not support midpoint wildcard record of
   the form 'x.*.y.z'.  The only wildcard form supported being the case
   where the wildcard is a prefix, i.e. '*.y.z'.  While it is possible
   to create wildcards that create the desired matches for a given
   prefix record, it is not possible to do so without ambiguity.  The
   patern *.y.z will match _p1.y.z as desired, but it will also match
   _p2.y.z and any other prefix.

   A DNS CNAME Resource record declares the canonical name for a given
   domain name.  Since the purpose of a DNS CNAME record is to 'alias'
   one name to another, it is clearly desirable for an alias to have
   effect for all prefixes associated with the domain name as well.  In
   practice a CNAME mapping x.y.z to p.q.r has no effect on queries for
   _prefix.x.y.z and the only way to ensure that these forward correctly

   is to create mappings for each case.

3.4.  Extended Discovery

   [C-DISC] Use of an extended discovery mechanism such as SRV, NAPTR
   and/or URI may be an Internet architecture requirement at some date
   in the future.

   Just as IPv4 addresses are running out, IP port numbers are facing a
   similar exhaustion issue.  IP only allows 16 bits for specification
   of port numbers and this is not extended in IPv6.  It is thus
   inevitable that the 'well known ports' mechanism will eventually run
   out of code points for assignment and that this will be replaced by
   some other mechanism.

   Extended discovery mechanisms such as SRV, NAPTR and URI provide an
   alternative means of service discovery, albeit with significant
   practical limitations in their current form.  In particular the
   extended discovery mechansisms proposed to date all employ some form
   of prefix mechanism as a substitute for well known port numbers and
   thus subject to the corresponding constraints [C-PREFIX].

   Another practical limitation to the use of SRV, NAPTR, URI, etc. is
   that the decision to support extended discovery and the selection of
   the extended discovery mechanism to be used rests with the protocol
   designer rather than the admninistrator of the domain where they are
   to be deployed.


4.  Requirements

   For convenience, requirements are separated into cryptographic
   requirements and protocol requirements.

   No attempt has been made to separate requirements according to
   priority except to note where a requirement is mandated by the DANE
   charter or is met by existing infrastrtucture.

4.1.  Cryptographic Requirements

   The cryptographic requirements are set out with the intention of
   drawing attention to the precise semantics involved.

4.1.1.  Key Publication

   [R-C-KEYPUB] Allow relying party to access the value of the key
   material which may or may not be valid for the domain for which it is
   published.

Internet-Draft       DANE Use Cases and Requirements          April 2011


   Key Publication does not necessarily entail any assertion concerning
   the validity and/or use of the certificate in question.  The
   certificate may have expired, it may have been revoked, it may bear
   no correspondance to the domain at which it is published whatsover.

   Example: www.example.com CERT 1 0 [ICANN KSK Certificate]

   Since publication of a key or certificaste does not in itself imply
   an assertion that it is to be considered trustworthy, satisfying this
   requirement does not necessitate the use of DNSSEC.

   Publication of cryptographic keying material is supported by the
   existing DNS CERT record.

   Existing CERT certificate types do not imply an assertion on the part
   of a domain name owner that the published keying material is valid
   for or indeed has any relationship to the specified domain
   whatsoever.

4.1.2.  Domain Validation

   [R-C-DV] Assert that a key is valid for use with a specific domain

   Example: www.example.com RR-TBS [CA root for *.example.com]

   Domain Validation entails an assertion that the specified certificate
   or key is valid for the associated domain but does not necessarily
   entail an assertion that the subject is trustworthy.

   Since the only criteria required to register a domain in most domains
   is to pay a registration fee, Domain Validation alone does not
   normally provide a useful basis for trust.

4.1.3.  Subject Validation

   [R-C-SV] Determine criteria that may indicate that the subject should
   be trusted.  E.g. reputation mechanisms, evidence of accountability.

   Subject Validation involves verification that is above and beyond the
   requirement for registration of a domain name.  The Extended
   Validation criteria set out requirements that are intended to provide
   a high degree of assurance that the subject is accountable according
   to legal process.

   Example: www.example.com RR-TBS [EV Cert for www.example.com]

Internet-Draft       DANE Use Cases and Requirements          April 2011


4.1.4.  Subject Attestation

   [R-C-SA] Vouch for the trustworthiness of the subject, i.e. shoulc we
   show Padlock Icon, Green Bar

4.1.5.  Certificate Validation

   [R-C-CV] Additional means of certificate validation/revocation that
   are outside the normal PKIX path.  E.g. specify trust roots,
   enumeration of valid certs.

4.1.6.  Certificate Issue Control

   [R-C-CI] Inform certificate issuers that a domain name owner requires
   specified validation criteria to apply in addition to those normally
   applied.

4.2.  Protocol Requirements

   In order for a client to make contact with a server, the client must
   discover the IP address and port number to connect to.

4.2.1.  Service Discovery

   Although the design of discovery mechanisms is outside the scope of
   DANE, the use of the DNS to obtain cryptographic service properties
   is predicated on the use of the DNS to perform service discovery.
   The means of DNS service discovery employed and interoperation of
   that means with DANE will have impact on performance.

   Also relevant to consideration in DANE is the range of discovery
   mechanisms supported.

4.2.1.1.  A RR Discovry

   [R-P-A] Support use of Internet service discovery by means of DNS A
   record and well known port assignment.

4.2.1.2.  A/AAAA RR Discovry

   [R-P-AAAA] Support use of Internet service discovery by means of DNS
   A record and AAAA record and well known port assignment.

   The introduction of IPv6 has led many protocol stacks to issue
   parallel requests for A and AAAA DNS records.  While this practice is
   out of scope for DANE protocol, the performance impact may be
   relevant.

Internet-Draft       DANE Use Cases and Requirements          April 2011


4.2.1.3.  Extended Discovery

   [R-P-EDISC] Support use of extended discovery mechanisms (e.g.  SRV,
   NAPTR, URI) mandated in protocol specification.

4.2.1.4.  Extended Meta-Discovery

   [R-P-MDISC] Support use of extended discovery mechanisms (e.g.  SRV,
   NAPTR, URI) selected by local DNS administrator.

4.2.2.  DNS Administration

4.2.2.1.  First Party Deployment

   [R-P-LOCAL] Support deployment by local network administration
   without reference to any other party.

4.2.2.2.  First Party with DNSSEC Deployment

   [R-P-LOCALD] Support deployment by local network administration
   without reference to any other party except for enrollment of DNSSEC
   KSK.

4.2.2.3.  Use of CNAME and other Aliases

   [R-P-CNAME] Support use of single CNAME records to establish aliases
   for a domain name and all associated protocol properties.

4.2.2.4.  Use of Wildcards

   [R-P-WILD] Support use of wildcards to establish default properties
   for all empty domain names within a tree.

4.2.3.  Protocol Specific Properties

4.2.3.1.  Security Properties

4.2.3.1.1.  Opportunistic Enhancement

   [R-P-OPP] Support protocol-specific properties to declare that a
   security enhancement is offered.

   Since most Internet traffic is exchanged without any form of
   cryptographic security, there is a school of thought that holds that
   any form of security enhancement must be an improvement, provided
   that the user is not led to believe that the degree of security
   offered is greater than it is.

   For example, an encryption mode that is vulnerable to a man in the
   middle attack is generally to be preferred to performing the same
   communication in plaintext.

   The use of DNS based keying and self signed certificates for such
   purposes has a long history in the IETF.

4.2.3.1.2.  Strict Security

   [R-P-STRICT] Support protocol-specific properties to declare that a
   security enhancement is offered and that strict compliance is
   requested.

   Strict security is similar to opportunistic enhancement except that
   it is intended to provide protection against downgrade attack by
   informing the client that it MUST NOT accept a service connection
   that does not meet certain security and/or trust criteria.

4.2.3.2.  Version Properties

   [R-P-VER] Support protocol specific properties such as identifying
   the version(s) of a protocol supported by a given service instance.


5.  Metrics

   Relevant performance and implementation metrics are specified as a
   means of guiding the selection process.

5.1.  Performance Metrics

   When defining performance metrics it is important to consider the
   performance of the system in which they are to be used rather than
   identifying easily measured but irrelevant properties of isolated
   components.

   Since the end goal of the application client is to establish a secure
   connection with the server, it is important to consider the
   performance metrics for both discovery and keying related purposes.
   A proposal that obtains the keying material in one round trip that
   can be performed in parallel with discovery by A-record will in the
   general case be more performant than one that only requires one round
   trip but the resquest cannot be made until after the A-record lookup
   has completed.

5.1.1.  Bandwidth

   DNS requests and responses are typically limited to a single packet
   in each case and thus bandwidth is normally irrelevant as far as
   measurement of performance goes.

5.1.2.  Latency

   Latency is a key performance metric for many interactive network
   applications.  Browser authors report that DNS latency has a major
   impact on overall user satisfaction [TBS].

   The extent that a protocol design choice has impact on latency
   depends on properties of the DNS that are heavily context dependent
   and thus do not translate directly into a latency metric.  In
   particular the time taken to complete a DNS round trip, the failure
   rate of DNS requests and the retransmit interval are all situation
   dependent and will have impact on how protocol design properties
   result in latency.

5.1.2.1.  TCP Fallback

   [M-TCP] Probability that a request will result in TCP/IP fallback.

   Attempts to exchange DNS packets larger than the maximum packet size
   supported results in an error and a retry using TCP/IP.

   In the best case, TCP fallback will result in a major impact on
   latency and server performance.  In the worst case, TCP fallback may
   fail as the mechanism is rarely required in normal DNS configuration
   and is frequently misconfigured in middleboxes such as firewalls.

5.1.2.2.  Round Trip Count

   [M-RT] Number of sequential DNS round trips required to address
   supported use cases.

   The number of round trips may depend on the circumstances.  For
   example a proposal might require 3 round trips in the worst case but
   resolve in 1 round trip in 95% of cases.  This may be preferable to a
   protocol that resolves in 2 round trips in every case.

   Implementations may in some cases mitigate the impact of a proposal
   requiring multiple round trips through speculative lookups.  For
   example, a protocol requirement to obtain the canonical form of
   'www.example.com' before applying a protocol specific prefix
   '_http._tcp' will require two round trips but this can be achieved in
   a single round trip if www.example.com is in fact canonical and the

   implementation makes a speculative request for
   '_http._tcp.www.example.com' at the same time as resolving for the

5.1.2.3.  DNS Lookup Count

   [M-LC] Total number of DNS queries required to address supported use
   cases including lookups performed in parallel.

   If DNS queries were perfectly reliable, a proposal that required ten
   lookups to be performed in parallel would have essentially the same
   performance characteristics as a proposal that only required one.

   In practice, DNS queries are not perfectly reliable and a proposal
   that requires ten lookups rather than one has roughly ten times the
   probability of a random failure.  Should a failure occur, the client
   must wait before retransmitting the request.  The typical timeout
   periods being many times the time taken for a round trip.

   Although preliminary studies [AL] suggest a failure rate for unknown
   DNS RR codes of approximately 1.5% it is not known what proportion of
   such requests will never resolve under any circumstances.

5.1.3.  Caching

   [Should say something obvious here]

5.2.  Implementation Metrics

5.2.1.  Number of States

   [M-STATES] Code Complexity measured by reference to the number of
   states required to create an implementation that is not optimized for
   performance.

5.2.2.  Number of Transitions

   [M-TRANS] Code Complexity measured by reference to the number of
   state transitions required to create an implementation that is not
   optimized for performance.

     Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN) Bundle Protocol IANA Registries
               draft-irtf-dtnrg-iana-bp-registries-02.txt

Abstract

   The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols such as Bundle
   Protocol and Licklider.  The specifications of these protocols
   contain fields that are subject to a registry.  For the purpose of
   its research work, the group created adhoc registries.  As the
   specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable
   implementations, the group would like to handoff the registries to
   IANA for official custody.  This document describes the actions
   needed to be executed by IANA.

Internet-Draft             DTN IANA Registries             February 2011


1.  Introduction

   The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols[RFC4838] such as
   Bundle Protocol[RFC5050] and Licklider[RFC5326].  The specifications
   of these protocols contain fields that are subject to a registry.
   For the purpose of its research work, the group created adhoc
   registries [1].  As the specifications are stable and have multiple
   interoperable implementations, the group would like to handoff the
   registries to IANA for official custody.  This document describes the
   actions needed to be executed by IANA.


2.  Treatment of Flag Fields Encoded using SDNVs

   The DTN protocols use several extensible bit flag fields that are
   encoded as Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) as defined in
   Section 4.1 of [RFC5050].  For these fields, the registry specifies
   the allocation and usage of bit positions within the unencoded field.
   The SDNV encoding treats the ensemble of bits in the unencoded value
   as a numeric value to be encoded on transmission and decoded on
   reception as described in [RFC5050].

   Processing of SDNV-encoded flags is discussed in
   [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-sdnv].

   Section 4.1 of [RFC5050] specifies that implementations are not
   required to handle SDNVs with more than 64 bits in their unencoded
   value.  Accordingly SDNV encoded flag fields should be limited to 64
   bit positions.

   IANA Registry policies and wording used in this document are
   described in [RFC5226].


3.  Bundle Protocol

   The Bundle Protocol(BP)[RFC5050] has fields requiring a registry
   managed by IANA.

3.1.  Bundle Block Types

   The Bundle Protocol has a Bundle Block Type code field (section
   4.5.2) [RFC5050].  An IANA registry shall be setup as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:
      0-191: Specification Required

      192-255: Private or experimental use.  No assignment by IANA.

   The Value range is: unsigned 8 bit integer.

    +--------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
    |        Value | Description                     | Reference     |

    |        2-191 | Unassigned                      |               |
    |      192-255 | Private and/or experimental use | [RFC5050]     |
    +--------------+---------------------------------+---------------+

   The value "0" was not defined in any document or in the adhoc
   registry.  As per concensus by the DNTRG research group, it is
   reserved per this document.

3.2.  Primary Bundle Protocol Version

   The Bundle Protocol has a version field (section 4.5.1) [RFC5050].
   An IANA registry shall be setup as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is: RFC Required

   The Value range is: unsigned 8 bit integer.

                 Primary Bundle Protocol Version Registry

                  +-------+-------------+---------------+
                  | Value | Description | Reference     |

                  +-------+-------------+---------------+

   The value "0-5" was not defined in any document or in the adhoc
   registry.  As per concensus by the DNTRG research group, it is
   reserved per this document.

3.3.  Bundle Processing Control Flags

   The Bundle Protocol has a Bundle Processing Control flags field
   (section 4.2) [RFC5050] encoded as an SDNV(see section (Section 2)).
   An IANA registry shall be setup as follows.

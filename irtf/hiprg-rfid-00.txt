Abstract 
    
   This document describes an architecture based on the Host Identity 
   Protocol (HIP), for active tags, i.e. RFIDs (Radio Frequency 
   Identifiers) that include tamper resistant computing resources, as 
   specified for example in the ISO 14443 or 15693 standards. HIP-Tags 
   never expose their identity in clear text, but hide this value 
   (typically an EPC-Code) by a particular equation (f) that can be only 
   solved by a dedicated entity, referred as the portal. HIP exchanges 
   occurred between HIP-Tags and portals; they are shuttled by IP 
   packets, through the Internet cloud.

                         HIP support for RFIDs             June 2010 
 
1 Overview 
    
1.1 Motivation 
    
   RFIDs are electronic devices, associated to things or computers, who 
   transmit their identity (usually a serial number) via radio links. 
    
   The first motivation for designing HIP support for RFIDs is to 
   enforce a strong privacy for the Internet of Things, e.g. identity is 
   protected by cryptographic procedures compatible with RFID computing 
   resources. As an illustration EPC codes or IP addresses are today 
   transmitted in clear form. 
    
   The second motivation is to define an identity layer for RFIDs 
   logically independent from the transport facilities, which may 
   optionally support IP stacks.  
    
   In other words we believe that the Internet of Things will be 
   Identity oriented; RFIDs will act as electronic ID for objects to 
   which they are linked. In this context privacy is a major challenge. 
    
1.2 Passive and active tags 
    
   An RFID is a slice of silicon whose area is about 1 mm2 for 
   components used as cheap electronic tags, and around 25 mm2 for chips 
   like contact-less smart cards inserted in passports and mobile 
   phones. 
    
   RFIDs are divided into two classes, the first includes devices that 
   embed CPU and memories (RAM, ROM, E2PROM) such as contact-less smart 
   cards, the second comprises electronic chips based on cabled logic 
   circuits. 
    
   There are multiple standards relative to RFIDs. 
    
   The ISO 14443 standard introduces components dealing with the 
   13,56Mhz frequency that embed a CPU and consume about 10mW; data 
   throughput is about 100 Kbits/s and the maximum working distance 
   (from the reader) is around 10cm. 
    
   The ISO 15693 standard also uses the same 13,56 MHz frequency, but 
   enables working distances as high as one meter, with a data 
   throughput of a few Kbits/s. 
    
   The ISO 18000 standard defines parameters for air interface 
   communications associated with frequency such as 135 KHz, 13,56 MHz, 
   2.45 GHz, 5.8 GHz, 860 to 960 MHz and 433 MHz. The ISO 18000-6 
   standard uses the 860-960 MHz range and is the basis for the Class-1 
   Generation-2 UHF RFID, introduced by the EPCglobal [EPCGLOBAL] 
   consortium.

1.3 About the Internet of Things (IoT) 
    
   The term "Internet of Thing (IoT)" was invented by the MIT Auto-ID 
   Center, in 2001, and refers to an architecture that comprises four 
   levels, 
    
   - Passive tags, such as Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFIDs, introduced by 
   the EPC Global consortium and operating in the 860-960 MHz range. 
    
   - Readers plugged to a local (computing) system, which read the 
   Electronic Product Code [EPC]. 
    
   - A local system, offering IP connectivity, which collects 
   information pointed by the EPC thanks to a protocol called Object 
   Naming Service (ONS) 
    
   - EPCIS (EPC Information Services) servers, which process incoming 
   ONS requests and returns PML (Physical Markup Language) files [PML], 
   e.g. XML documents that carry meaningful information linked to tags. 
    
1.4 HIP-Tags 
    
   This document suggests embedding a modified version of HIP stack in 
   active tags, named HIP-Tags. It assumes that such devices would not 
   support an IP stack, but should be rather identity oriented, i.e. 
   will use readers IP resources in order to unveil their EPC-Code only 
   to trusted entities (called portals in the architecture in Figure 1). 
   Privacy, e.g. identity protection seems a key prerequisite [SEC] 
   before the effective massive deployment of these devices.

   The functional HIP-TAG architecture includes three logical entities, 
    
   - HIP tags. HIP is transported by IP packets. HIP tags support a 
   modified version of this protocol but don't require end-to-end IP 
   transport. 
    
   - RFID readers. They provide IP connectivity and communicate with 
   tags through radio link either defined by EPC Global or ISO 
   standards. The IP layer transports HIP messages between tags and 
   other HIP entities. According to HIP, an SPI (Security Parameter 
   Index) associated to an IPSEC tunnel MAY be used by the IP host (e.g. 
   a reader) in order to route HIP packets to/from the right software 
   identity. 
    
   - HAT, HIP Address Translator. HIP messages MAY be encapsulated by 
   protocols such as UDP in order to facilitate HIP transport in 
   existing software and networking architectures. The HAT does not 
   modify the content of an HIP packet. 
    
   - PORTAL entity. This device manages a set of readers; it is an HIP 
   entity that includes a full IP stack. Communications between portal 
   and tags logically work as peer to peer HIP exchanges. RFID identity 
   (HIT) is hidden and appears as a pseudo random value; within the 
   portal a software block called the IDENTITY SOLVER resolves an 
   equation f, whose solution is an EPC Code. The portal accesses to 
   EPCIS services; when required privacy may be enforced by legacy 
   protocol such as SSL or IPSEC. 
    
   - The portal maintains a table linking HIT and EPC-Code. It acts as a 
   router for that purpose it MUST provide an identity resolution 
   mechanism, i.e. a relation between HIT and EPC-Code. 
    
1.5 Main differences between HIP-TAGS and HIP 
    
   In HIP [HIP], the HIT (Host Identifier Tag) is a fix value obtained 
   from the hash of an RSA public key. This parameter is therefore 
   linked to a unique identity, and can be used for traceability 
   purposes; in other words HIP does not natively include privacy 
   features. 
    
   In [BLIND], it is proposed to hide the HIT with by random number 
   thanks to a hash function, i.e. 
   B-HIT = sha1(HIT || N), with N a random value and || the 
   concatenation operation. 
   The case in which only one HIT (either imitator or responder) is 
   blinded looks similar to the HIP-TAGS protocol described in this 
   draft working with a particular transform (HMAC Transform, 0x001)

2. Basic Exchange 
    
   The HIP-Tags basic exchange (T-BEX) is derived from the "classical" 
   BEX exchange, introduced in [HIP]. It is a four ways handshake 
   illustrated by Figure 2.

   A HAT layer MAY be used to transport HIP messages in non IP context, 
   but this optional facility is out of scope from this document. 
    
2.1 I1-T 
    
   When a reader detects a tag, it realizes all low level operations in 
   order to set up a radio communication link. Finally the reader 
   delivers a START message that trigs the tag.

   The HIP tag sends the I1-T packet (I suffix meaning initiator), in 
   which HIT-I is a true random value internally generated by the HIP-
   Tag. 
    
   If the tag doesn't known the portal HIT it sets the HIT-R value to 
   zero; in that case the reader MAY modify this field in order to 
   identify the appropriate entity. 
    
   The I1-T message is not signed. 
    
2.2 R1-T 
    
   The portal produces the R1-T (R suffix meaning responder) packet, 
   which includes a nonce r1 and optional parameters. These fields 
   indicate a list of supported authentication schemes (HIP-T-
   TRANSFORMs) and a list of ESP-TRANSFORMs, i.e. secure channels that 
   could be opened between portal and tags. 
    
   This message includes the following fields: 
   - HIT-I, a random number which identified a TAG 
   - HIT-R, the portal HIP either a null or fix value. 
   - HIT-T-TRANSFORMs, a list of authentication schemes 
   - ESP-T-TRANSFORM, an optional list of ESP secure channels 
    
   The R1-T message is not signed. 
    
2.3 I2-T 
    
   The HIP-Tag builds the I2-T message, which contains 
    
   - The selected HIP-T-TRANSFORM (the current authentication scheme). 
   - An optional ESP-TRANSFORM (a class of secure channel between tag 
   and portal). 
   - A nonce r2, included in the R-T attribute. 
   - An equation f(r1, r2, EPC-Code), whose solution, according to the 
   selected HIP-T-TRANSFORM, unveils the EPC-Code value. 
   - An optional ESP-Info attribute that gives information about the 
   secure (ESP) channel, and which includes the SPI-I value. 
   - A signature (Signature-T), which works with a KI-Auth-key deduced 
   from r1, r2 and the hidden EPC-CODE value. 
    
   KI-Auth-key = g(r1, r2, EPC-Code) 
    
   The signature is computed over the complete I2-T message, the content 
   of Signature-T resulting from this calculation is initially set to a 
   nul value 
    
   The portal and the tag shares secret keys. The meaning of these keys 
   are dependent upon the f equation.

   In some cases the EPC-Code is the only shared key. The portal knows a 
   list of EPC-Code and tries all solutions for solving f, according to 
   brute force techniques. As an illustration a hash function may be 
   used for f: 
   f= sha1(r1 || r2 || EPC-Code), where || is the concatenation 
   operation. 
    
   In other cases a set of keys is shared between portal and tags. For 
   example a binary tree of HMAC procedure may be used, each Hmac beeing 
   assocaited to a particular key. A binary tree of order p may identify 
   2**p tags, each of them stores p keys. The f function is a list of p 
   values such as  
    
                           HMAC(r1 || r2, ki || cti) 
    
   Where ki is a secret ki and cti the bit value (either 0 or 1) at the 
   rang i for the EPC-Code (or tag index) 
    
2.4 R2-T 
    
   The fourth and last R2-T packet is optional. It includes  
    
   - A signature (Signature-T) computed with the KI-Auth-key deduced 
   from r1, r2 and the hidden EPC-CODE value. 
    
   KI-Auth-key = g(r1, r2, EPC-Code) 
    
   - An optional ESP-Info attribute that gives information about the 
   secure (ESP) channel, and which includes the SPI-R value. 
    
   The R2-T packet is mandatory when an ESP channel has been previously 
   negotiated. ESP channel is required if the portal intends to perform 
   read or write operations with the tags.

5.1 Type 0x0001, HMAC 
    
  5.1.1 F-T computing (f function) 
    
   The F-T function produces a 20 bytes result, according to the 
   relation: 
    
   K = HMAC-SHA1(r1 | r2, EPC-Code) 
    
   Y = f(r1, r2, EPC-Code) = HMAC-SHA1(K, CT1 | "Type 0001 key") 
    
   Where: 
    
   - SHA1 is the SHA1 digest function 
    
   - EPC-Code is the tag identity 
    
   - HMAC-SHA1 is the keyed MAC algorithm based on the SHA1 digest 
   procedure. 
    
   - CT1 is a 32 bits string, whose value is equal to 0x00000001 
    
   - r1 and r2 are the two random values exchanged by the BEX 
    
  5.1.2 K-Auth-Key computing (g function) 
    
   The K-Auth-Key is computing according to the relation:

   K = HMAC-SHA1(r1 | r2, EPC-Code) 
    
   Y = HMAC-SHA1(K, CT2 | "Type 0001 key") 
    
   Where: 
    
   - SHA1 is the SHA1 digest function 
    
   - EPC-Code is the tag identity 
    
   - HMAC-SHA1 is the keyed MAC algorithm based on the SHA1 digest 
   procedure. 
    
   - CT2 is a 32 bits string, whose value is equal to 0x00000002 
    
   - r1 and r2 are the two random values exchanged by the BEX 
    
  5.1.3 Signature-T computing 
    
   The HMAC-SHA1 function is used with the K-Auth-Key secret value: 
    
   Signature-T(HIT-T packet) = HMAC-SHA1(K-Auth-Key, HIP-T packet) 
    
5.2 Type 0x0002, Keys-Tree 
    
  5.2.1 F-T computing (f function) 
    
   The F-T function produces a list of Hi, 1<= i <= n, of nx20 bytes 
   results, according to the relation: 
    
    
   Y = f(r1, r2, EPC-Code) = H1 | H2 | Hi | Hn 
    
   With  
   Hi = HMAC-SHA1(r1 | r2, Ki | CT1 ) 
   Or 
   Hi = HMAC-SHA1(r1 | r2, Ki | CT2 ) 
    
    
   Where: 
    
   - SHA1 is the SHA1 digest function 
    
   - Ki is a set of n secret keys. Each EPC-Code is associated with an 
   index of n bits, whose value b1b2...bn is secretly notified by the 
   list H1 H2...Hn 
    
   - HMAC-SHA1 is the keyed MAC algorithm based on the SHA1 digest 
   procedure. 
    
   - CT1 is a 32 bits string, whose value is equal to 0x00000001

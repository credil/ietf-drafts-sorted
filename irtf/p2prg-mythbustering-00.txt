Abstract

   Peer-to-peer traffic optimization techniques that aim at improving
   locality in the peer selection process have attracted great interest
   in the research community and have been subject of much discussion.
   Some of this discussion has produced controversial myths, some rooted
   in reality while others remain unfounded.  This document evaluates
   the most prominent myths attributed to P2P optimization techniques by
   referencing the most relevant study (or studies) that have addressed
   facts pertaining to the myth.  Using these studies, we hope to either
   confirm or refute each specific myth.

Internet-Draft     Peer Selection in P2P Applications        August 2009


1.  Introduction

   Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used for file-sharing, streaming and
   realtime communications exchange large amounts of data in connections
   established among the peers themselves and are responsible for an
   important part of the Internet traffic.  Since applications have
   generally no knowledge of the underlying network topology, the
   traffic they generate is frequent cause of congestions in inter-
   domain links and significantly contributes to the raising of transit
   costs paid by network operators and Internet Service Providers (ISP).

   One approach to reduce congestions and transit costs caused by P2P
   applications consists of enhancing the peer selection process with
   the introduction of proximity information.  This allows the peers to
   identify the topologically closer resource among all the instances of
   the resources they are looking for.  Several solutions following such
   an approach have recently been proposed [Choffnes] [Aggarwal] [Xie],
   some of which are now being considered for standardization in the
   IETF [ALTO].

   Despite extensive research based on simulations and field trials, it
   is hard to predict how proposed solutions would perform in a real-
   world systems made of millions of peers.  For this reason, possible
   effects and side-effects of optimization techniques based on P2P
   traffic localization have been a matter of frequent debate.  This
   document describes some of the most interesting effects, referencing
   relevant studies which have addressed them and trying to determine
   whether and in what measure they are likely to happen.

   Each possible effect -- or Myth -- is examined in three phases:
   o  Facts: in which a list of relevant data is presented, usually
      collected from simulations or field trials;
   o  Discussion: in which the reasons for and against the myth are
      discussed based on the facts previously listed;
   o  Conclusions: in which the authors try to epress a reasonable
      measure of the plausibility of the myth.

   This document at the current stage is little more than a strawman.
   With the help of the IRTF community, the authors would like to
   improve it, in the number of the Facts, in the quality of the
   Discussion and, particularly, in the trustworthiness of the
   Conclusions.


2.  Definitions

   Terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement] is reused
   here; other definitions should be consistent with it.

Internet-Draft     Peer Selection in P2P Applications        August 2009


2.1.  Seeder

   A peer that has a complete copy of the content it is sharing, and
   still offers it for upload.  The term "seeder" is adopted from
   BitTorrent terminology and is used in this document to indicate
   upload-only peers also in other kinds of P2P applications.

2.2.  Leecher

   A peer that has not yet completed the download of a specific content
   (but usually has already started offering for upload the part it is
   in possession of).  The term "leecher" is adopted from BitTorrent
   terminology and is used in this document to indicate peers that are
   both uploading and downloading, also in other kinds of P2P
   applications.

2.3.  Swarm

   The group of peers that are uploading and/or downloading pieces of
   the same content.  The term "swarm" is commonly used in BitTorrent,
   to indicate all seeders and leechers exchanging chuncks of a
   particular file; however, in this document it is used more generally,
   for example, in the case of P2P streaming applications, to refer to
   all peers receiving and/or transmitting the same media stream.

2.4.  Tit-for-tat

   A content exchange strategy where the amount of data sent by a
   leecher to another leecher is roughly equal to the amount of data
   received from it.  P2P applications, most notably BitTorrent, adopt
   such an approach to maximize resources shared by the users.

2.5.  Surplus Mode

   The status of a swarm where the upload capacity exceeds the download
   demand.  A swarm in surplus mode is often referred to as "well
   seeded".

2.6.  Transit

   The service through which a network can exchange IP packets with all
   other networks it is not directly connected to.  The transit service
   is always regulated by a contract, according to which the custumer
   (i.e. a network operator or an ISP) pays the transit provider per
   amount of data exchanged.

2.7.  Peering

   The direct interconnection between two separate networks for the
   purpose of exchanging traffic without recurring to a transit
   provider.  Peering is usually regulated by agreements taking in
   account the amount of traffic generated by each party in each
   direction.


3.  Myths, Facts and Discussion

3.1.  Reduced Cross-domain Traffic

   The reduction in cross-domain traffic (and thus in transit costs due
   to it) is one of the positive effects P2P traffic localization
   techniques are expected to cause, and also the main reason way ISPs
   look at them with interest.  Simulations and field tests have shown a
   reduction varying from 20% to 80%.

3.1.1.  Facts

   1.  Various simulations and initial field trials of the P4P solution
       [Xie] on average show a 70% reduction of cross-domain traffic.
   2.  Data observed in Comcast's P4P trial
       [I-D.livingood-woundy-p4p-experiences] show a 34% reduction of
       the outgoing P2P traffic and an 80% reduction of the incoming.
   3.  Simulations of the "oracle-based" approach [Aggarwal] proposed by
       researchers at TU Berlin show an increase in local exchanges from
       10% in the unbiased case to 60%-80% in the localized case.
   4.  Simulations of the localization approach proposed in [LeBlond]
       run on data collected from crawling of real BitTorrent swarms
       indicate a 40% reduction of cross-domain traffic.

3.1.2.  Discussion

   Tautologically, P2P traffic localization techniques tend to localize
   content exchanges, and thus reduce cross-domain traffic.

3.1.3.  Conclusions

   Confirmed.

3.2.  Increased Application Performance

   Ostensibly, the increase in application performance is the main
   reason for the consideration of P2P traffic localization techniques
   in academia and industry.  The expected increase depends on the
   specific application: file sharing applications witness an increase



Marocco, et al.         Expires February 21, 2010               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Peer Selection in P2P Applications        August 2009


   in the download rate, realtime communication applications observe
   lower delay and jitter, and streaming applications can benefit by a
   high constant bitrate.

3.2.1.  Facts

   1.  Various simulations and initial field trials of the P4P solution
       [Xie] show an average reduction of download completion times
       between 10% and 23%.
   2.  Data observed in Comcast's P4P trial
       [I-D.livingood-woundy-p4p-experiences] show and increase in
       download rates between 13% and 85%.  Interestingly, the data
       collected in the experiment also indicate that fine-grained
       localization is less effective in improving download performance
       compared to lower levels of localization.
   3.  Data collected in the Ono experiment [Choffnes] show a 31%
       average download rate improvement.
       *  In networks where the ISP provides higher bandwidth for in-
          network traffic (e.g. as in the case of RDSNET, described in
          [Choffnes]), the increase is significantly higher.
       *  In networks with relatively low uplink bandwidth (as the case
          of Easynet, described in [Choffnes]), traffic localization
          slightly degrades application performance.
   4.  Simulations of the "oracle-based" approach [Aggarwal] proposed by
       researchers at TU Berlin show a reduction in download times
       between 16% and 34%.
   5.  Simulations by Bell Labs [Seetharaman] indicate that localization
       is not as effective in all scenarios and that the user experience
       can suffer in certain locality-aware swarms based on the actual
       implementation of locality.

3.2.2.  Discussion

   It seems that traffic localization techniques often cause an
   improvement in application performance.  However, it must be noted
   that such beneficial effects heavily depend on the network
   infrastructures.  In some cases, for example in networks with
   relatively low uplink bandwidth, localization seems to be useless if
   not harmful.  Also, beneficial effects depend on the swarm size;
   imposing locality when only a small set of local peers are available
   may even decrease download performance for local peers.

3.2.3.  Conclusions

   Very likely, especially for large swarms and in networks with high
   capacity.

Internet-Draft     Peer Selection in P2P Applications        August 2009


3.3.  Increased Uplink Bandwidth Usage

   The increase in uplink bandwidth usage would be a negative effect,
   especially in environments where the access network is based on
   technologies providing asymmetric upstream/downstream bandwidth (e.g.
   DSL or DOCSIS).

3.3.1.  Facts

   1.  Data observed in Comcast's P4P trial
       [I-D.livingood-woundy-p4p-experiences] show no increase in the
       uplink traffic.

3.3.2.  Discussion

   Mathematically, average uplink traffic remains the same as long as
   the swarm is not in surplus mode.  However, in some particular cases
   where surplus capacity is available, localization may lead to local
   low-bandwiwth leechers connecting to each other instead of trying the
   external seeders.  Even if such a phenomenon has not been observed in
   simulations and field trials, it could occur to applications that use
   localization as the only means for optimization when some content
   becomes popular in different areas at different times (as is the case
   of prime time TV shows distributed on BitTorrent networks minutes
   after getting aired in North America).

3.3.3.  Conclusions

   Unlikely.

3.4.  Impacts on Peering Agreements

   Peering agreements are usually established on a reciprocity basis,
   assuming that the amount of data sent and received by each party is
   roughly the same (or, in case of asymmetric traffic volumes, a
   compensation fee is paid by the party which would otherwise obtain
   the most gain).  P2P traffic localization techniques aim at reducing
   cross-domain traffic and thus might also impact peering agreements.

3.4.1.  Facts

   No significant publications, simulations or trials have tried to
   understand how traffic localization techniques can influence factors
   that rule how peering agreements are established and maintained.

Internet-Draft     Peer Selection in P2P Applications        August 2009


3.4.2.  Discussion

   This is a key topic for network operators and ISPs, and certainly
   deserves to be analyzed more accurately.  Some random thoughts
   follow.

   It seems reasonable to expect different effects depending on the
   kinds of agreements.  For example:
   o  ISPs with different customer bases: the ISP whose customers
      generate more P2P traffic can achieve a greater reduction of
      cross-domain traffic and thus could probably be in a position to
      re-negotiate the contract ruling the peering agreement;
   o  ISPs with similar customer bases:
      *  ISPs with different access technologies: customers of the ISP
         which provides higher bandwidth -- and, in particular, higher
         uplink bandwidth -- will have more incentives for keeping their
         P2P traffic local.  Consequently, the ISP with a better
         infrastructure will be able to achieve a greater reduction in
         cross-domain traffic and will be probably in a position to re-
         negotiate the peering agreement;
      *  ISPs with similar access technologies: both ISPs would achieve
         roughly the same reduction in cross-domain traffic and thus the
         conditions under which the peering agreement had been
         established would not change much.

   As a consequence of the reasoning above, it seems reasonable to
   expect that the simple fact that one ISP starts localizing its P2P
   traffic will be a strong incentive for the ISPs it peers with to do
   that as well.

   It's worth noting that traffic manipulation techniques have been
   reportedly used by ISPs to obtain peering agreements [Norton] with
   larger ISPs.  One of the most used technique involves injecting
   forged traffic into the target ISP's network, in order to increase
   its transit costs.  Such a techniques aims at increasing the
   relevance of the source ISP in the target's transit bill and thus
   motivate the latter to sign a peering agreement.  However, traffic
   injection is exclusively unidirectional and easy to detect.  On the
   other hand, if a localization-like service were used to direct P2P
   requests toward the target network, the resulting traffic would
   appear fully legitimate and, since in popular applications that
   follow the tit-for-tat approach peers tend to upload to the peers
   they download from, in many cases also bi-directional.

3.4.3.  Conclusions

   Likely.

Internet-Draft     Peer Selection in P2P Applications        August 2009


3.5.  Impacts on Transit

   One of the main goals of P2P traffic localization techniques is to
   allow ISPs to keep local a part of the traffic generated by their
   customers and thus save on transit costs.  However, similar
   techniques based on de-localization rather than localization may be
   used by those ISP that are also transit providers to artificially
   increase the amount of data exchanged with networks they provide
   transit to (i.e. pushing the peers run by their customers to
   establish connections with peers in the networks that pay them for
   transit).

3.5.1.  Facts

   No significant publications, simulations or trials have tried to
   study effects of traffic localization techniques on the dynamics of
   transit provision economics.

3.5.2.  Discussion

   It is actually very hard to predict how the economics of transit
   provision would be affected by the tricks some transit providers
   could play on their customers making use of P2P traffic localization
   -- or, in this particular case, de-localization -- techniques.  This
   is also a key topic for ISPs, definitely worth an accurate
   investigation.

   Probably, the only lesson contentions concerning transit and peering
   agreement have teached so far [CogentVsAOL] [SprintVsCogent] is that,
   at the end of the day, no economic factor, no matter how much
   relevant it is, is able to isolate different networks from each
   other.

3.5.3.  Conclusions

   Likely.

3.6.  Swarm Weakening

   Peer selection techniques based on locality information are certainly
   beneficial in areas where the density of peers is high enough, but
   may cause damages otherwise.  Some studies have tried to understand
   to what extent locality can be pushed without damaging peers in
   isolated parts of the network.

Internet-Draft     Peer Selection in P2P Applications        August 2009


3.6.1.  Facts

   1.  Experiments with real BitTorrent clients run by researchers at
       INRIA [LeBlond] have shown that, in BitTorrent, even when peer
       selection is heavily based on locality, swarms do not get
       damaged.
   2.  Simulations by Bell Labs [Seetharaman] indicate that the user
       experience can suffer in certain locality-aware swarms based on
       the actual implementation of locality.

3.6.2.  Discussion

   It seems reasonable to expect that excessive traffic localization
   will cause some degree of deterioration in P2P swarms based on the
   tit-for-tat approach, and the damages of such deterioration will
   likely affect most users in networks with lower density of peers.
   However, while [LeBlond] shows that BitTorrent is extremely robust,
   the level of tolerance to locality for different P2P algorithms
   should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

3.6.3.  Conclusions

   Plausible, in some circumstances.

3.7.  Improved P2P Caching

   P2P caching has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce cross-
   domain as well as uplink P2P traffic.  Since the cache servers
   ultimately act as seeders, a cache-aware localization service would
   allow a seamless integration of a caching infrastructure with P2P
   applications [I-D.weaver-alto-edge-caches].

3.7.1.  Facts

   1.  A traffic analysis performed in a major Israeli ISP [Leibowitz]
       has shown that P2P traffic has a theoretical caching potential of
       67% byte-hit-rate.

3.7.2.  Discussion

   P2P Caching may be beneficial for both ISPs and network users, and
   locality-based optimizations may help the ISP to direct the peers
   towards caches.  Anyway it is hard to figure at this point in time if
   the positive effects of localization will make caching superfluous or
   not economically justifiable for the ISP.

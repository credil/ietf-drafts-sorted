<section title="Background">
  <t>
    A cipher is an encryption method.  Encryption is a transformation
    of data that uses a secret key to change a plaintext value, which
    needs to be kept secret, into a ciphertext value, which can be
    safely revealed without the loss of the confidentiality of the
    plaintext.  Ciphertext can be converted back into plaintext,
    through the use of the secret key, via a decryption algorithm that
    is the reverse of the encryption algorithm.  Importantly,
    encryption does not protect the integrity or authenticity of the
    plaintext; it does not provide a data integrity service, or a data
    origin authentication service <xref target="RFC4949"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    Authenticated Encryption is an encryption method that does protect
    the integrity and authenticity of the plaintext, as well as the
    confidentiality of the plaintext.  Authenticated Encryption with
    Associated Data (AEAD) protects the confidentiality, integrity,
    and authenticity of the plaintext, and also protects the integrity
    and authenticity of some associated data <xref target="RFC5116"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    A Block Cipher is an encryption algorithm that encrypts a
    fixed-size plaintext block with a secret key, resulting in a
    fixed-size ciphertext block.  The encryption is reversible, so
    that the plaintext block can be computed from the key and the
    ciphertext block.  Block ciphers are not directly used to encrypt
    data, but instead are used in a mode of operation, as described
    below.   A block cipher has two parameters: block size (the number 
    of bits in the fixed-size blocks), and key size (the number
    of bits in the key).   Some block ciphers accept different 
    key sizes.  
  </t>
  <t>
    A Block Cipher Mode of Operation is a method for encrypting and/or
    authenticating data.  Most modes of operation can operate on
    arbitrary-length data, unlike the block cipher itself, which can
    only operate on fixed length data.  The mode of operation
    logically breaks plaintext into fixed-size blocks, and processes
    these blocks using the block cipher (and other operations such
    as bitwise exclusive-or).    
  </t>
  <t>
    A Stream Cipher is an encryption method that does not use a block
    cipher, and is not used in a mode of operation; instead, the
    stream cipher defines its own encryption method.  Most stream
    ciphers encrypt plaintext by generating pseudorandom data with a
    secret key, then bitwise exclusive-oring the pseudorandom data
    with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext.  Some stream ciphers
    take an Initialization Vector (IV) as input; a different IV is
    provided to the cipher for each different message that is
    encrypted.  A stream cipher has two parameters: IV size (the
    number of bits in the IV), and key size (the number of bits in the
    key).  Some stream ciphers accept different key sizes.
  </t>
<section title="Attack Models">
  <t>
    There are many different attack models that are used to analyze
    the security of ciphers.  An attack model is a formal statement of
    the attacker's capabilities.  A particular cipher may be strong in
    one attack model, but weak in another; the suitability of that
    cipher for use in a particular application will depend entirely on
    the attacker's actual capabilities in the real world.
  </t>
  <t>
    In a Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA), the attacker knows some of the
    plaintexts that encrypted, and can learn the resulting
    ciphertexts.  The attacker can observe the ciphertext resulting
    from the encryption of some unknown plaintexts, and observe the
    ciphertext resulting from the encryption of some plaintexts of its
    choice.  
  </t>
  <t>
    In a Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA), the attacker can choose the
    plaintexts that encrypted, and can learn the resulting
    ciphertexts.  The attacker can observe the ciphertext resulting
    from the encryption of some unknown plaintexts, and can cause the
    encryption of some plaintexts of its choice, and can observe the
    resulting ciphertexts.  A CPA is adaptive if the attacker can
    adapt the plaintexts that it chooses based on other data that it
    observes.
  </t>
  <t>
    In a Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (CCA), the attacker can cause the
    decryption of some ciphertexts of its choice, and can learn the
    results of those decryptions.  The attacker can also observe the
    ciphertext resulting from the encryption of some unknown
    plaintexts.  A CCA is adaptive if the attacker can adapt the
    ciphertexts that it chooses based on other data that it observes.
    (Authenticated Encryption protects against these attacks.)
  </t>
  <t>
    In a Related-Key Attack (RKA), the attacker can cause the
    encryption of unknown plaintext values under two or more keys,
    where the relationship between the keys is known to the attacker,
    but the actual value of the keys is not known.  For example, if
    keys K1 and K2 are in use, the attacker might know the value of
    the bitwise exclusive-or of K1 and K2, while not knowing the value
    of either key.  Related-Key Attacks do not have any effect on
    security when keys are chosen independently, as is the case in
    most security protocols.  It is unclear that it is a reasonable
    theoretical goal for a cipher to be resistant to RKAs.  
  </t>
  <t>
    In a Side-Channel Attack (SCA), the attacker has access to
    physical side information beyond the digital representation of the
    plaintexts and ciphertexts, such as the voltage levels used during
    the encryption process, or fine-grained timing information about
    the duration of the encryption operations.  Side-Channel Attacks
    act against an implementation of a cipher, rather than against the
    cipher itself, since the side information is a property of an
    implementation and not of a cipher design.
  </t>
  <t>
    In a Key Recovery Attack (KRA), the attacker learns the secret key
    that is used to encrypt some ciphertext.  In a Plaintext Recovery
    Attack (PRA), the attacker learns some unknown plaintext, but
    does not learn the secret key.  A successful KRA is devastating,
    but a successful PRA can also be quite damaging.   
  </t>
</section>
<section title="Security Goals">
<t>
An encryption method is indistinguishable from random whenever its
ciphertext cannot be distinguished from a random value by a
computationally limited adversary.  This idea has been mathematically
formalized, and is fundamental to the analysis of ciphers.  A cipher
cannot be secure unless it is indistinguishable, and thus, 
this is the main security goal.  
</t>
<t>
Typical block cipher modes of operation are insecure when the amount
of data processed by a single key is larger than w * 2^(w/2) bits,
where w is the block size of the block cipher.  (Here and below 2^w
denotes 2 to the power w.)  This limit is called the birthday bound,
by analogy to the fact that, in a group of people, a birthday common
to two people is more likely than one might expect.  
The birthday bound is a primary
consideration for the security of block ciphers.
Above the
birthday bound, all of the block cipher modes of operation that are in
common use are distinguishable from random, and are vulnerable to
plaintext recovery attacks.  
<list>
  <t>
    The bound for a 64-bit block cipher is 2^34 bytes, or 4 Gigabytes, and
  </t>
  <t>
    The bound for a 128-bit block cipher is 2^67 bytes, or 128 Trillion Gigabytes.
  </t>
</list>
In practice, it is highly desirable that the amount of data is
significantly below the birthday bound, in order to make the
likelihood of a successful plaintext recovery attack negligible.
</t>
<t>
It is highly desirable that a block cipher be indistinguishable from
random even if the attacker knows most of the 2^w possible w-bit
plaintext/ciphertext pairs for a given key.  However, because of the
birthday bound, a block cipher should not be used to encrypt more than
2^(w/2) plaintexts, and attacks against a block cipher that require
more than 2^(w/2) plaintexts or ciphertexts may have no effect on the
practical security of that cipher.   
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Guidance">
  <t>
    It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that any cipher used be secure in the
    KPA, adaptive CPA, and adaptive CCA models.  The security against
    this type of attack is determined by the cipher design.
  </t>
  <t>
    It is RECOMMENDED that any implementation of a cipher be secure in
    the SCA model, and it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that any
    implementation that must operate while in the physical possession
    of an attacker be secure in the SCA model.  The security against
    this type of attack is determined by the particulars of the
    implementation, and not the design of the cipher.  However, a
    specific cipher design may be easier to implement such that it is
    secure in the SCA model, compared to other ciphers.
  </t>
  <t>
    When encryption is in use, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that either
    1) Authenticated Encryption or AEAD be used, or 2) an encryption
    method be used in conjunction with an algorithm that protects the
    authenticity of the data, such as a Message Authentication Code
    <xref target="RFC4949"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    64-bit block ciphers SHOULD NOT be used, because of the plaintext
    recovery attacks that are possible against them.  When a 64-bit
    block cipher is used for legacy reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that
    the amount of data encrypted by a single key is 1 Megabyte.
    </t>
<section title="AES Compatibility">
  <t>
    At present, the most widely used cipher is the Advanced Encryption
    Standard (see Section <xref target="AES"/>), which is believed to
    provide adequate security for the foreseeable future.  It has a
    block size of 128 bits, and key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
    We say that a cipher is AES-compatible if it supports the same
    block and key sizes, and that a cipher is partially AES-compatible
    if it supports the same block size and at least one of the key
    sizes.  
  </t>
  <t>
    AES-compatible ciphers include ARIA, CAST-256, Camellia, Serpent,
    and Twofish.  Partly-AES-compatible ciphers include SEED and SMS4,
    both of which only support 128 bit keys.  All of these ciphers, 
    except for SMS4, are either free from intellectual property
    claims, or are available worldwide royalty free.  
  </t>
  <t>
    The existence of strong ciphers that are free of intellectual
    property restrictions shows that it is not necessary to use
    encumbered ciphers in order to obtain good security.

      SMS4 is used in the Chinese National Standard for Wireless LAN WAPI.SMS4 was
      a proposed cipher to be used in IEEE 802.11i standard,but so far been rejected
      by ISO.One of the reasons for the rejection has been opposition to the WAPI 
      fast-track proposal by the IEEE.
      SMS4 uses an 8-bit S-box,performs 32 rounds to process one block.A non-linear
      key schedule is used to produce the round keys.

      SEED is developed by the Korean Information Security Agency.It is used broadly
      throughout South Korean industry,but seldom found elsewhere.It gained popularity
      in Korea because 40-bit SSL was not considered strong enough (see 40-bit encryption),
      so the Korean Information Security Agency developed its own standard.However, this
      decision has historically limited the competition of web browsers in Korea.
      SEED is a 16-round Feistel network with 128-bit blocks. It uses two 8 ¡Á 8 S-boxes which, 
      like those of SAFER, are derived from discrete exponentiation (in this case, x247 and 
      x251 ¨C plus some "incompatible operations"). It also has some resemblance to MISTY1 in 
      the recursiveness of its structure: the 128-bit full cipher is a Feistel network with an 
      F-function operating on 64-bit halves, while the F-function itself is a Feistel network 
      composed of a G-function operating on 32-bit halves. However the recursion does not extend 
      further because the G-function is not a Feistel network. In the G-function, the 32-bit 
      word is considered as four 8-bit bytes, each of which is passed through one or the other of 
      the S-boxes, then combined in a moderately complex set of boolean functions such that each 
      output bit depends on 3 of the 4 input bytes.
      SEED has a fairly complex key schedule, generating its thirty-two 32-bit subkeys through application 
      of its G-function on a series of rotations of the raw key, combined with round constants derived (as 
      in TEA) from the Golden ratio.

      Camellia is a 128-bit block cipher jointly developed by Mitsubishi and NTT. The cipher has 
      been approved for use by the ISO/IEC, the European Union's NESSIE project and the Japanese 
      CRYPTREC project. The cipher has security levels and processing abilities comparable to the 
      Advanced Encryption Standard.Camellia's block size is 16 bytes (128 bits).The block cipher 
      was designed to be suitable for both software and hardware implementations, from low-cost 
      smart cards to high-speed network systems.
      Camellia is a Feistel cipher with either 18 rounds or 24 rounds. Every six rounds, a logical 
      transformation layer is applied: the so-called "FL-function" or its inverse. Camellia uses 
      four 8 x 8-bit S-boxes with input and output affine transformations and logical operations. 
      The cipher also uses input and output key whitening. The diffusion layer uses a linear 
      transformation based on an MDS matrix with a branch number of 5.

      CAST-256 (or CAST6) is a block cipher. It was submitted as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption 
      Standard (AES); however, it was not among the five AES finalists. It is an extension of an earlier 
      cipher, CAST-128; both were designed according to the "CAST" design methodology invented by Carlisle 
      Adams and Stafford Tavares. Howard Heys and Michael Wiener also contributed to the design.
      CAST-256 uses the same elements as CAST-128, including S-boxes, but is adapted for a block size of 128 
      bits ¡ª twice the size of its 64-bit predecessor. (A similar construction occurred in the evolution of 
      RC5 into RC6).CAST-256 is composed of 48 rounds, sometimes described as 12 "quad-rounds", arranged in 
      a generalised Feistel network.

    	(AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data. It has been adopted by the U.S. government and is now used 
    	worldwide.
    	AES was announced by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as U.S. FIPS PUB 197 (FIPS 197) on November 26, 
    	2001 after a five-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before it was 
    	selected as the most suitable. It became effective as a Federal government standard on May 26, 2002 after approval by the 
    	Secretary of Commerce. It is available in many different encryption packages. AES is the first publicly accessible and open 
    	cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for top secret information.
      Originally called Rijndael, the cipher was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, and submitted 
      by them to the AES selection process.
      AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution-permutation network. It is fast in both software and hardware.
      AES operates on a 4¡Á4 column-major order matrix of bytes, termed the state (versions of Rijndael with a larger block size 
      have additional columns in the state). Most AES calculations are done in a special finite field.The AES cipher is specified 
      as a number of repetitions of transformation rounds that convert the input plaintext into the final output of ciphertext. 
      Each round consists of several processing steps, including one that depends on the encryption key. A set of reverse rounds 
      are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key.

    </t>
    <t>
    	Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits. It was one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption 
    	Standard contest, but was not selected for standardisation. Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher Blowfish.
    	Twofish's distinctive features are the use of pre-computed key-dependent S-boxes, and a relatively complex key schedule.Twofish 
    	borrows some elements from other designs; for example, the pseudo-Hadamard transform (PHT) from the SAFER family of ciphers. Twofish 
    	uses the same Feistel structure as DES.
      On most software platforms Twofish was slightly slower than Rijndael for 128-bit keys, but somewhat faster for 256-bit keys.
      Twofish was designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson; 
      Twofish algorithm is free for anyone to use without any restrictions whatsoever. It is one of a few ciphers included in the OpenPGP 
      standard (RFC 4880). However, Twofish has seen less widespread usage than Blowfish, which has been available longer.

    	Serpent was a finalist in the AES contest,where it came second to Rijndael.Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson,Eli Biham,and Lars Knudsen.
    	Serpent was widely viewed as taking a more conservative approach to security than the other AES finalists, opting for a larger 
    	security margin: the designers deemed 16 rounds to be sufficient against known types of attack, but specified 32 rounds as insurance 
    	against future discoveries in cryptanalysis.
      The Serpent cipher is in the public domain and has not been patented. There are no restrictions or encumbrances whatsoever regarding its 
      use. As a result, anyone is free to incorporate Serpent in their software (or hardware implementations) without paying license fees.

      DES was first published in 1977.
      It is specified in <xref target="FIPS-46"/>,
      and its key length is 56 bits.
     </t>
    <t>
      IETF use includes 66 drafts and 158 RFCs.
      </t>
    <t>
      Intellectual Property Rights have been claimed on DES.  The
      owner of those rights is IBM.  According to <xref
      target="FIPS-46-3"/>, TDES may be "covered by U.S. and foreign
      patents, including patents issued to the International Business
      Machines Corporation. However, IBM has granted nonexclusive,
      royalty-free licenses under the patents to make, use and sell
      apparatus which complies with the standard."

       DES is currently obsolete; its key size is inadequate to
       protect against attackers with access to modern computing
       resources.  The security implications of using DES are
       discussed at length in <xref target="RFC4772"/>.  Historically,
       DES was intstrumental in the development of moden cryptography;
       Differential <xref target="C:BihSha90"/> and Linear <xref
       target="EC:Matsui93"/> Cryptanalysis were developed through the
       analysis of the DES algorithm.
    </t>
    <t>
      DES was designed by an IBM research team led by Horst Feistel, a
      German-born cryptographer.  DES was a refinement of the earlier
      LUCIFER cipher, which is the first modern block cipher that has been
      publicly described.

  <section title="Kcipher-2">
    <t>
      Kcipher-2 was first published in 2011.
      It is specified in
      <xref target="I-D.kiyomoto-kcipher2"/> 
      and supports a key length of 128 bits, and a 128-bit
      initialization vector.
     </t>
    <t>
      IETF use includes 2 drafts, which specify the cipher and describe
      its use in TLS.

    <t>
      Intellectual Property Rights have been claimed on Kcipher-2.
      The owners of those rights are KDDI and Qualcomm.

 <section title="Rabbit">
    <t>
      Rabbit was first published in 2003 <xref target="FSE:BVPCS03"/> in a
      peer-reviewed workshop.  
      It is specified in <xref target="RFC4503"/>, and
      supports a keys length of 128 bits, and a 64-bit IV.
     </t>
    <t>
      The only citation in IETF documents is the cipher specification itself.
      </t>
    <t>
      Intellectual Property Rights have been claimed on this cipher.
      The owner of those rights is Cryptico A/S.
    </t>
    <t>
      The best known attacks against this cipher have a complexity
      greather than 2^128, and thus do not violate its security goals.
      Distinguishing attacks were shown in <xref target="ISC:LuDes10"/> <xref target="ISC:LuWanLin08"/>.  
      Side channels and fault injection attacks were considered in <xref target="INDOCRYPT:BerCanGou09"/> and <xref target="SAC:KirYou09"/>, 
      which described state-recovery attacks 
      with 2^38 complexity.

    <t>
      Rabbit is the only finalist from eSTREAM, the ECRYPT Stream
      Cipher Project, that appears in this note.  Rabbit has a
      relatively small internal state of about 64 bytes, and it
      updates all words of state at each iteration, in contrast to RC4
      (<xref target="RC4"/>).

  <section anchor="RC4" title="RC4">
    <t>
      RC4 was first described in 1994.  No normative specification
      exists; it is sometimes called ARCFOUR, which is short for
      alleged RC4.  The cipher supports key lengths of 8, 16, 24, ...,
      1024 bits.   RC4 does not accept an initialization vector.
<!--
      It is specified in <xref target="draft-ietf-krb-wg-des-die-die-die-04"/>(REFERENCE),
      and supports keys lengths 8,16,24,¡­,and 1024.

     </t>
    <t>
      IETF use includes 54 RFCs and 23 drafts, which 
      describe the use of RC4 
      in TLS, Kerberos, and SSH.

  A Framework of Media-Independent Pre-Authentication (MPA) for Inter-
                      domain Handover Optimization
                  draft-irtf-mobopts-mpa-framework-09

Abstract

   This document describes Media-independent Pre-Authentication (MPA), a
   new handover optimization mechanism that addresses the issues on
   existing mobility management protocols and mobility optimization
   mechanisms to support inter-domain handover.  MPA is a mobile-
   assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that works over any
   link-layer and with any mobility management protocol and is best
   applicable to support optimization during inter-domain handover.
   MPA's pre-authentication, pre-configuration, and proactive handover
   techniques allow many of the handoff related operations to take place
   before the mobile has moved to the new network.  We describe the
   details of all the associated techniques and its applicability for
   different scenarios involving various mobility protocols during
   inter-domain handover.  We have implemented MPA mechanism for various
   network layer and application layer mobility protocols and report
   summary of experimental performance results in this document.

   This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations (MobOpts)
   Research Group.

1.  Introduction

   As wireless technologies including cellular and wireless LAN are
   beginning to get popular, supporting terminal handovers across
   different types of access networks, such as from a wireless LAN to
   CDMA or to GPRS is considered a clear challenge.  On the other hand,
   supporting seamless terminal handovers between access networks of the
   same type is still more challenging, especially when the handovers
   are across IP subnets or administrative domains.  To address those
   challenges, it is important to provide terminal mobility that is
   agnostic to link-layer technologies in an optimized and secure
   fashion without incurring unreasonable complexity.  In this document
   we discuss a framework to support terminal mobility that provides
   seamless handovers with low latency and low loss.  Seamless handovers
   are characterized in terms of performance requirements as described
   in Section 1.2. [mpa-wireless] is an accompanying document which
   describes implementation of a few MPA-based systems including
   performance results to show how existing protocols could be leveraged
   to realize the functionalities of MPA.

   Terminal mobility is accomplished by a mobility management protocol
   that maintains a binding between a locator and an identifier of a
   mobile node, where the binding is referred to as the mobility
   binding.  The locator of the mobile node may dynamically change when
   there is a movement of the mobile node.  The movement that causes a
   change of the locator may occur when there is a change in attachment
   point due to physical movement or network change.  A mobility
   management protocol may be defined at any layer.  In the rest of this
   document, the term "mobility management protocol" refers to a
   mobility management protocol which operates at the network layer or
   higher.

   There are several mobility management protocols at different layers.
   Mobile IP [RFC5944] and Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] are mobility management
   protocols that operate at the network layer.  Similarly, MOBIKE
   (IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming) [RFC4555] is an extension to IKEv2
   that provides the ability to deal with a change of an IP address of
   an IKEv2 end-point.  There are several ongoing activities in the IETF
   to define mobility management protocols at layers higher than network
   layer.  HIP (the Host Identity Protocol) [RFC5201] defines a new
   protocol layer between network layer and transport layer to provide
   terminal mobility in a way that is transparent to both network layer
   and transport layer.  Also, SIP-based mobility is an extension to SIP
   to maintain the mobility binding of a SIP user agent [SIPMM].

   While mobility management protocols maintain mobility bindings, these
   cannot provide seamless handover if used in their current form.  An
   additional optimization mechanism is needed to prevent the loss of

   inflight packets transmitted during mobile's binding update procedure
   and to achieve seamless handovers.  Such a mechanism is referred to
   as a mobility optimization mechanism.  For example, mobility
   optimization mechanisms [RFC4881] and [RFC5568] are defined for
   Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6, respectively, by allowing neighboring
   access routers to communicate and carry information about mobile
   terminals.  There are protocols that are considered as "helpers" of
   mobility optimization mechanisms.  The CARD (Candidate Access Router
   Discovery Mechanism) protocol [RFC4065] is designed to discover
   neighboring access routers.  The CTP (Context Transfer Protocol)
   [RFC4066] is designed to carry state that is associated with the
   services provided for the mobile node, or context, among access
   routers.  We describe some of the fast-handover schemes that attempt
   to reduce the handover delay in Section 4.

   There are several issues in existing mobility optimization
   mechanisms.  First, existing mobility optimization mechanisms are
   tightly coupled with specific mobility management protocols.  For
   example, it is not possible to use mobility optimization mechanisms
   designed for Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6 for MOBIKE.  What is strongly
   desired is a single, unified mobility optimization mechanism that
   works with any mobility management protocol.  Second, there is no
   existing mobility optimization mechanism that easily supports
   handovers across administrative domains without assuming a pre-
   established security association between administrative domains.  A
   mobility optimization mechanism should work across administrative
   domains in a secure manner only based on a trust relationship between
   a mobile node and each administrative domain.  Third, a mobility
   optimization mechanism needs to support not only terminals with
   multiple-interfaces where simultaneous connectivity through multiple
   interfaces or connectivity through single interface can be expected,
   but also terminals with single-interface.

   This document describes a framework of Media-independent Pre-
   Authentication (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that
   addresses all those issues.  MPA is a mobile-assisted, secure
   handover optimization scheme that works over any link-layer and with
   any mobility management protocol including Mobile IPv4, Mobile IPv6,
   MOBIKE, HIP, SIP mobility.  In cases of multiple operators without
   roaming relationship or without agreement to participate in a key
   management scheme, MPA provides a framework that can perform pre-
   authentication to establish the security mechanisms without assuming
   a common source of trust.  In MPA, the notion of IEEE 802.11i pre-
   authentication is extended to work at higher layer, with additional
   mechanisms to perform early acquisition of IP address from a network
   where the mobile node may move as well as proactive handover to the
   network while the mobile node is still attached to the current
   network.  Since this document focuses on the MPA framework, it is

   left to future work to choose the protocols for MPA and define
   detailed operations.  The accompanying document [mpa-wireless]
   provides one method that describes usage and interactions between
   existing protocols to accomplish MPA functionality.

   This document represents the consensus of the (MobOpts) Research
   Group.  It has been reviewed by Research Group members active in the
   specific area of work.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Performance Requirements

   In order to provide desirable quality of service for interactive VoIP
   and streaming traffic, one needs to limit the value of end-to-end
   delay, jitter and packet loss to a certain threshold level.  ITU-T
   and ITU-E standards define the acceptable values for these
   parameters.  For example for one-way delay, ITU-T G.114 [RG98]
   recommends 150 ms as the upper limit for most of the applications,
   and 400 ms as generally unacceptable delay.  One way delay tolerance
   for video conferencing is in the range of 200 to 300 ms [ITU98].
   Also if an out-of-order packet is received after a certain threshold,
   it is considered lost.  According to ETSI TR 101 [ETSI], a normal
   voice conversation can tolerate up to 2% packet loss.  But this is
   the mean packet loss probability and may be applicable to a scenario
   when the mobile is subjected to repeated handoff during a normal
   conversation.  Measurement techniques for delay and jitter are
   described in [RFC2679], [RFC2680] and [RFC2681].

   In case of interactive VoIP traffic, end-to-end delay affects the
   jitter value, and thus is an important issue to consider.  An end-to-
   end delay consists of several components, such as network delay,
   operating system (OS) delay, codec delay and application delay.  A
   complete analysis of these delays can be found in [Wenyu].  During a
   mobile's handover, in-flight transient traffic cannot reach the
   mobile because of the associated handover delay.  These in-flight
   packets could either be lost or buffered.  If the in-flight packets
   are lost, then it contributes to jitter between the last packet
   before handoff and first packet after handoff.  If these packets are
   buffered, packet loss is minimized, but there is additional jitter
   for the in-flight packets when these are flushed after the handoff.
   Buffering during handoff avoids the packet loss, but at the cost of



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   additional one-way-delay.  A trade-off between one-way-delay and
   packet loss is desired based on the type of application.  For
   example, for streaming application, packet loss can be reduced by
   increasing the playout buffer resulting in longer one-way packet
   delay.

   The handover delay is attributed due to several factors, such as
   discovery, configuration, authentication, binding update and media
   delivery.  Many of the security related procedures such as handover
   keying and re-authentication procedures deal with cases where there
   is a single source of trust at the top and the underlying AAA domain
   elements trust the top source of trust and the keys it generates and
   distributes.  In this scenario, there is an appreciable delay in re-
   establishing link security related parameters, such as
   authentication, link key management and access authorization during
   inter-domain handover.  The focus of this draft is the design of a
   framework that can reduce the delay due to authentication and other
   handoff related operations such as configuration and binding update.


2.  Terminology

   Mobility Binding:  A binding between a locator and an identifier of a
      mobile terminal.

   Mobility Management Protocol (MMP):  A protocol that operates at
      network layer or above to maintain a binding between a locator and
      an identifier of a mobile node.

   Binding Update:  A procedure to update a mobility binding.

   Media-independent Pre-Authentication Mobile Node (MN):  A mobile node
      of media-independent pre-authentication (MPA) which is a mobile-
      assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that works over any
      link-layer and with any mobility management protocol.  An MPA
      mobile node is an IP node.  In this document, the term "mobile
      node" or "MN" without a modifier refers to "MPA mobile node".  An
      MPA mobile node usually has a functionality of a mobile node of a
      mobility management protocol as well.

   Candidate Target Network (CTN):

      A network to which the mobile may move in the near future.

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   Target Network (TN):  The network to which the mobile has decided to
      move.  The target network is selected from one or more candidate
      target network.

   Proactive Handover Tunnel (PHT):  A bidirectional IP tunnel
      [RFC2003], [RFC2473] that is established between the MPA mobile
      node and an access router of a candidate target network.  In this
      document, the term "tunnel" without a modifier refers to
      "proactive handover tunnel.

   Point of Attachment (PoA):  A link-layer device (e.g., a switch, an
      access point or a base station) that functions as a link-layer
      attachment point for the MPA mobile node to a network.

   Care-of Address (CoA):  An IP address used by a mobility management
      protocol as a locator of the MPA mobile node.


3.  Handover Taxonomy

   Based on the type of movement, type of access network, and underlying
   mobility support, one can primarily define the handover as inter-
   technology, intra-technology, inter-domain, and intra-domain.  We
   describe briefly each of these handover processes.  However, our
   focus of the dicussion is on Inter-domain handover.

   Inter-technology: A mobile may be equipped with multiple interfaces,
   where each interface can support different access technology (802.11,
   CDMA).  A mobile may communicate with one interface at any time in
   order to conserve the power.  During the handover the mobile may move
   out of the footprint of one access technology (e.g., 802.11) and move
   into the footprint of a different access technology (e.g., CDMA).
   This will warrant switching of the communicating interface on the
   mobile as well.  This type of Inter-technology handover is often
   called as Vertical Handover since the mobile makes movement between
   two different cell sizes.

   Intra-technology: An intra-technology handover is defined when a
   mobile moves between the same type of access technology such as
   between 802.11[a,b,n] and 802.11 [a,b,n] or between CDMA1XRTT and
   CDMA1EVDO.  In this scenario a mobile may be equipped with a single
   interface (with multiple PHY types of the same technology) or with
   multiple interfaces.  An Intra-technology handover may involve intra-
   subnet or inter-subnet movement and thus may need to change its L3
   locator depending upon type of movement.

   Inter-domain: A domain can be defined in several ways.  But for the
   purposes of roaming we define domain as an administrative domain



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   which consists of networks that are managed by a single
   administrative entity which authenticates and authorizes a mobile for
   accessing the networks.  An administrative entity may be a service
   provider, an enterprise and any organization.  Thus an Inter-domain
   handover will by-default be subjected to inter-subnet handover and in
   addition it may be subjected to either inter-technology or intra-
   technology handover.  A mobile is subjected to inter-subnet handover
   when it moves from one subnet (broadcast domain) to another subnet
   (broadcast domain).  Inter-domain handover will be subjected to all
   the transition steps a subnet handover goes through and in addition
   it will be subjected to authentication and authorization process as
   well.  It is also likely that the type of mobility support in each
   administrative domain will be different.  For example, administrative
   domain A may have MIPv6 support, while administrative domain B may
   use Proxy MIPv6.

   Intra-domain: When a mobile's movement is confined to movement within
   an administrative domain it is called intra-domain movement.  An
   intra-domain movement may involve intra-subnet, inter-subnet, intra-
   technology and inter-technology as well.

   Both inter-domain and intra-domain handovers can be subjected to
   either inter-technology or intra-technology handover based on the
   network access characteristics.  Inter-domain handover requires
   authorization for acquisition or modification of resources assigned
   to a mobile and the authorization needs interaction with a central
   authority in a domain.  In many cases, an authorization procedure
   during inter-domain handover follows an authentication procedure that
   also requires interaction with a central authority in a domain.
   Thus, security associations between the network entities such as
   routers in the neighboring administrative domains need to be
   established before any interaction takes place between these
   entities.  Similarly, an inter-domain mobility may involve different
   mobility protocols in each of its domains, such as MIPv6 and Proxy-
   MIPv6.  In that case, one needs a generalized framework to achieve
   the optimization during inter-domain handover.  Figure 1 shows a
   typical example of inter-domain mobility involving two domains, such
   as domain A and domain B. It illustrates several important components
   such as AAA Home server (AAAH), AAA visited servers (e.g., AAAV1 and
   AAAV2), Authentication Agent (AA), Layer 3 point of attachment, such
   as Access Router (AR) and layer 2 point of attachment, such as Access
   Point.  Any mobile maybe using a specific mobility protocol and
   associated mobility optimization technique during intra-domain
   movement in either domain.  But the same optimization technique may
   not be suitable to support inter-domain handover independent of
   whether it uses the same or different mobility protocol in either
   domain.

4.  Related Work

   While basic mobility management protocols such as Mobile IP
   [RFC5944], Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775], SIP-Mobility [SIPMM] provide
   continuity to TCP and RTP traffic, these are not optimized to reduce
   the handover latency during mobile's movement between subnets and
   domains.  In general these mobility management protocols introduce
   handover delays incurred at several layers such as, layer 3 and
   application layer for updating the mobile's mobility binding.  These
   protocols also get affected due to underlying layer 2 delay as well.
   As a result, applications using these mobility protocols suffer from
   performance degradation.

   There have been several optimization techniques that apply to current
   mobility management schemes that try to reduce handover delay and
   packet loss during a mobile's movement between cells, subnets and
   domain.  Micro-mobility management schemes [CELLIP], [HAWAII], and
   intra-domain mobility management schemes such as [IDMP],
   [I-D.ietf-mobileip-reg-tunnel] and [RFC5380] provide fast-handover by
   limiting the signaling updates within a domain.  Fast Mobile IP
   protocols for IPv4 and IPv6 networks [RFC4881], [RFC5568] utilize
   mobility information made available by link layer triggers.  Yokota
   et al.  [YOKOTA] propose joint use of access point and a dedicated
   MAC bridge to provide fast-handover without altering the MIPv4
   specification.  Shin et al.  [MACD] propose a scheme reducing the
   delay due to MAC layer handoff by providing a cache-based algorithm.
   In this scheme, the mobile caches the neighboring channels that it
   has already visited and thus uses a selective scanning method.  This
   helps to reduce the associated scanning time.

   Some mobility management schemes use dual interfaces thus providing
   make-before-break [SUM].  In a make-before-break situation,
   communication usually continues with one interface, when the
   secondary interface is in the process of getting connected.  The IEEE
   802.21 working group is discussing these scenarios in detail
   [802.21].  Providing fast-handover using a single interface needs
   more careful design than for a client with multiple interfaces.
   Dutta et al [SIPFAST] provide an optimized handover scheme for SIP-
   based mobility management, where the transient traffic is forwarded
   from the old subnet to the new one by using an application layer
   forwarding scheme.  [MITH] provides a fast handover scheme for the
   single interface case that uses mobile-initiated tunneling between
   the old foreign agent and new foreign agent.  [MITH] defines two
   types of handover schemes such as Pre-MIT (Mobile Initiated
   Tunneling) and Post-MIT (Media Initiated Tunneling).  The proposed
   MPA scheme is very similar to MITH's predictive scheme where the
   mobile communicates with the foreign agent before actually moving to
   the new network.  However, the MPA scheme is not limited to MIP; this



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   scheme takes care of movement between domains and performs pre-
   authentication in addition to proactive handover.  Thus, MPA reduces
   the overall delay to close to link-layer handover delay.  Most of the
   mobility optimization techniques developed so far are restricted to a
   specific type of mobility protocol only.  While supporting
   optimization for inter-domain mobility, these protocols assume that
   there is a pre-established security arrangement between two
   administrative domains.  But this assumption may not be viable
   always.  Thus, there is a need to develop an optimization mechanism
   that can support inter-domain mobility without any underlying
   constraints or security related assumption.

   Recently, the HOKEY WG within IETF is defining the ways to expedite
   the authentication process.  In particular, it has defined pre-
   authentication [RFC5836] and fast re-authentication [RFC5169]
   mechanisms to expedite the authentication and security association
   process.


5.  Applicability of MPA

   MPA is more applicable where an accurate prediction of movement can
   be easily made.  For other environments, special care must be taken
   to deal with issues such as pre-authentication to multiple CTNs
   (Candidate Target Networks) and failed switching and switching back
   as described in [mpa-wireless].  However, addressing those issues in
   actual deployments may not be easier.  Some of the deployment issues
   are described in Appendix C.

   Authors have cited several use cases of how MPA can be used to
   optimize several network layer and application layer mobility
   protocols in an accompanying document [mpa-wireless].  The
   effectiveness of MPA may be relatively reduced if the network employs
   network-controlled localized mobility management in which the MN does
   not need to change its IP address while moving within the network.
   The effectiveness of MPA may also be relatively reduced if signaling
   for network access authentication is already optimized for movements
   within the network, e.g., when simultaneous use of multiple
   interfaces during handover is allowed.  In other words, MPA is a more
   viable as a solution for inter-administrative domain predictive
   handover without the simultaneous use of multiple interfaces.  Since
   MPA is not tied to a specific mobility protocol, it is also
   applicable to support optimization for inter-domain handover where
   each domain may be equipped with a different mobility protocol.
   Figure 1 shows an example of inter-domain mobility where MPA could be
   applied.  For example, domain A may support just Proxy MIPv6, whereas
   domain B may support Client Mobile IPv6.  MPA's different functional
   components can provide the desired optimization techniques

6.  MPA Framework

6.1.  Overview

   Media-independent Pre-Authentication (MPA) is a mobile-assisted,
   secure handover optimization scheme that works over any link layer
   and with any mobility management protocol.  With MPA, a mobile node
   is not only able to securely obtain an IP address and other
   configuration parameters for a CTN, but also able to send and receive
   IP packets using the IP address obtained before it actually attaches
   to the CTN.  This makes it possible for the mobile node to complete
   the binding update of any mobility management protocol and use the
   new CoA before performing a handover at link-layer.

   MPA adopts the following basic procedures to provide this
   functionality.  The first procedure is referred to as "pre-
   authentication", the second procedure is referred to as "pre-
   configuration", the combination of the third and fourth procedures
   are referred to as "secure proactive handover".  The security
   association established through pre-authentication is referred to as
   an "MPA-SA".

   This functionality is provided by allowing a mobile node which has
   connectivity to the current network but is not yet attached to a CTN,
   to (i) establish a security association with the CTN to secure the
   subsequent protocol signaling, then (ii) securely execute a
   configuration protocol to obtain an IP address and other parameters
   from the CTN as well as execute a tunnel management protocol to
   establish a Proactive Handover Tunnel (PHT) [RFC2003] between the
   mobile node and an access router of the CTN, then (iii) send and
   receive IP packets, including signaling messages for binding update
   of an MMP and data packets transmitted after completion of binding
   update, over the PHT using the obtained IP address as the tunnel
   inner address, and finally (iv) deleting or disabling the PHT
   immediately before attaching to the CTN when it becomes the target
   network and then re-assigning the inner address of the deleted or
   disabled tunnel to its physical interface immediately after the
   mobile node is attached to the target network through the interface.
   Instead of deleting or disabling the tunnel before attaching to the
   target network, the tunnel may be deleted or disabled immediately
   after being attached to the target network.

   Especially, the step (iii) in the previous paragraph (i.e., binding
   update procedure) makes it possible for the mobile to complete the
   higher-layer handover before starting link-layer handover.  This



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   means that the mobile is able to send and receive data packets
   transmitted after completing the binding update over the tunnel,
   while data packets transmitted before completion of binding update do
   not use the tunnel.

6.2.  Functional Elements

   In the MPA framework, the following functional elements are expected
   to reside in each CTN to communicate with a mobile node:
   Authentication Agent (AA), Configuration Agent (CA) and Access Router
   (AR).  These elements can reside in one or more network devices.

   An authentication agent is responsible for pre-authentication.  An
   authentication protocol is executed between the mobile node and the
   authentication agent to establish an MPA-SA.  The authentication
   protocol MUST be able to establish a shared key between the mobile
   node and the authentication agent and SHOULD be able to provide
   mutual authentication.  The authentication protocol SHOULD be able to
   interact with a AAA protocol such as RADIUS and Diameter to carry
   authentication credentials to an appropriate authentication server in
   the AAA infrastructure.  This interaction happens through the
   Authentication Agent such as PANA Authentication Agent (PAA).  The
   derived key is used for further deriving keys used for protecting
   message exchanges used for pre-configuration and secure proactive
   handover.  Other keys that are used for bootstrapping link-layer
   and/or network-layer ciphers MAY also be derived from the MPA-SA.  A
   protocol that can carry EAP [RFC3748] would be suitable as an
   authentication protocol for MPA.

   A configuration agent is responsible for one part of pre-
   configuration, namely securely executing a configuration protocol to
   deliver an IP address and other configuration parameters to the
   mobile node.  The signaling messages of the configuration protocol
   (e.g., DHCP) MUST be protected using a key derived from the key
   corresponding to the MPA-SA.

   An access router in MPA framework is a router that is responsible for
   the other part of pre-configuration, i.e., securely executing a
   tunnel management protocol to establish a proactive handover tunnel
   to the mobile node.  IP packets transmitted over the proactive
   handover tunnel SHOULD be protected using a key derived from the key
   corresponding to the MPA-SA.  Details of this procedure are described
   in Section 6.3.

6.3.  Basic Communication Flow

   Assume that the mobile node is already connected to a point of
   attachment, say oPoA (old point of attachment), and assigned a
   care-of address, say oCoA (old care-of address).  The communication
   flow of MPA is described as follows.  Throughout the communication
   flow, data packet loss should not occur except for the period during
   the switching procedure in Step 5, and it is the responsibility of
   link-layer handover to minimize packet loss during this period.

   Step 1 (pre-authentication phase): The mobile node finds a CTN
   through some discovery process such as IEEE 802.21 and obtains the IP



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   addresses of an authentication agent, a configuration agent and an
   access router in the CTN (Candidate Target Network) by some means.
   Details about discovery mechanisms are discussed in Section 7.1.  The
   mobile node performs pre-authentication with the authentication
   agent.  As discussed in Section 7.2, the mobile may need to pre-
   authenticate with multiple candidate target networks.  The decision
   regarding which candidate network the mobile needs to pre-
   authenticate with will depend upon several factors, such as signaling
   overhead, bandwidth requirement (QoS), mobile's location,
   communication cost, and handover robustness etc.  Determining the
   policy that decides the target network the mobile should pre-
   authenticate with is out of scope for this document.

   If the pre-authentication is successful, an MPA-SA is created between
   the mobile node and the authentication agent.  Two keys are derived
   from the MPA-SA, namely an MN-CA key and an MN-AR key, which are used
   to protect subsequent signaling messages of a configuration protocol
   and a tunnel management protocol, respectively.  The MN-CA key and
   the MN-AR key are then securely delivered to the configuration agent
   and the access router, respectively.

   Step 2 (pre-configuration phase): The mobile node realizes that its
   point of attachment is likely to change from oPoA to a new one, say
   nPoA (new point of attachment).  It then performs pre-configuration
   with the configuration agent using the configuration protocol to
   obtain several configuration parameters such as an IP address, say
   nCoA (new care-of address), and default router from the CTN.  The
   mobile then communicates with the access router using the tunnel
   management protocol to establish a proactive handover tunnel.  In the
   tunnel management protocol, the mobile node registers oCoA and nCoA
   as the tunnel outer address and the tunnel inner address,
   respectively.  The signaling messages of the pre-configuration
   protocol are protected using the MN-CA key and the MN-AR key.  When
   the configuration and the access router are co-located in the same
   device, the two protocols may be integrated into a single protocol
   like IKEv2.  After completion of the tunnel establishment, the mobile
   node is able to communicate using both oCoA and nCoA by the end of
   Step 4.  A configuration protocol and a tunnel management protocol
   may be combined in a single protocol or executed in different orders
   depending on the actual protocol(s) used for configuration and tunnel
   management.

   Step 3 (secure proactive handover main phase): The mobile node
   decides to switch to the new point of attachment by some means.
   Before the mobile node switches to the new point of attachment, it
   starts secure proactive handover by executing the binding update
   operation of a mobility management protocol and transmitting
   subsequent data traffic over the tunnel (main phase).  This proactive



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   binding update could be triggered based on certain local policy at
   the mobile node end, after the pre-configuration phase is over.  This
   local policy could be signal-to-noise ratio, location of the mobile
   etc.  In some cases, it may cache multiple nCOA addresses and perform
   simultaneous binding with the CN or HA.

   Step 4 (secure proactive handover pre-switching phase): The mobile
   node completes the binding update and becomes ready to switch to the
   new point of attachment.  The mobile may execute the tunnel
   management protocol to delete or disable the proactive handover
   tunnel and cache nCoA after deletion or disabling of the tunnel.
   This transient tunnel can be deleted prior to or after the handover.
   The buffering module at the next access router buffers the packets
   once the tunnel interface is deleted.  The decision as to when the
   mobile node is ready to switch to the new point of attachment depends
   on the handover policy.

   Step 5 (switching): It is expected that a link-layer handover occurs
   in this step.

   Step 6 (secure proactive handover post-switching phase): The mobile
   node executes the switching procedure.  Upon successful completion of
   the switching procedure, the mobile node immediately restores the
   cached nCoA and assigns it to the physical interface attached to the
   new point of attachment.  If the proactive handover tunnel was not
   deleted or disabled in Step 4, the tunnel is deleted or disabled as
   well.  After this, direct transmission of data packets using nCoA is
   possible without using a proactive handover tunnel.

   Call flow for MPA is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

7.  MPA Operations

   In order to provide an optimized handover for a mobile experiencing
   rapid movement between subnets and/or domains handover, one needs to
   look into several operations.  These issues include:

   i) discovery of neighboring networking elements, ii) connecting to
   the right network based on certain policy, iii) changing the layer 2
   point of attachment, iv) obtaining an IP address from a DHCP or PPP
   server, v) confirming the uniqueness of the IP address, vi) pre-
   authenticating with the authentication agent, vii) sending the
   binding update to the correspondent host viii) obtaining the
   redirected streaming traffic to the new point of attachment, ix)
   ping-pong effect, x) probability of moving to more than one network
   and associating with multiple target networks.  We describe these
   issues in detail in the following paragraphs and describe how we have
   optimized these in case of MPA-based secure proactive handover.

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


7.1.  Discovery

   Discovery of neighboring networking elements such as access points,
   access routers, authentication servers helps expedite the handover
   process during a mobile's movement between networks.  After
   discovering the network neighborhood with a desired set of
   coordinates, capabilities and parameters the mobile can perform many
   of the operation such as pre-authentication, proactive IP address
   acquisition, proactive address resolution, and binding update while
   in the previous network.

   There are several ways a mobile can discover neighboring networks.
   The Candidate Access Router Discovery protocol [RFC2608] helps
   discover the candidate access routers in the neighboring networks.
   Given a certain network domain SLP (Service Location Protocol)
   [RFC4066] and DNS help provide addresses of the networking components
   for a given set of services in the specific domain.  In some cases
   many of the network layer and upper layer parameters may be sent over
   link layer management frames such as beacons when the mobile
   approaches the vicinity of the neighboring networks.  IEEE 802.11u is
   considering issues such as discovering neighborhood using information
   contained in link layer.  However, if the link-layer management
   frames are encrypted by some link layer security mechanism, then the
   mobile node may not be able to obtain the requisite information
   before establishing link layer connectivity to the access point.  In
   addition this may add burden to the bandwidth constrained wireless
   medium.  In such cases a higher layer protocol is preferred to obtain
   the information regarding the neighboring elements.  Some proposals
   such as [802.21] help obtain information about the neighboring
   networks from a mobility server.  When the movement is imminent, the
   mobile node starts the discovery process by querying a specific
   server and obtains the required parameters such as the IP address of
   the access point, its characteristics, routers, SIP servers or
   authentication servers of the neighboring networks.  In the event of
   multiple networks, it may obtain the required parameters from more
   than one neighboring networks and keep these in a cache.  At some
   point the mobile finds out several CTNs out of many probable networks
   and starts the pre-authentication process by communicating with the
   required entities in the CTNs.  Further details of this scenario are
   in Section 7.2.

7.2.  Pre-authentication in multiple CTN environment

   In some cases, although a mobile selects a specific network to be the
   target network, it may actually end up with moving into a neighboring
   network other than the target network due to factors that are beyond
   the mobile's control.  Thus it may be useful to perform the pre-
   authentication with a few probable candidate target networks and



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   establish time-bound transient tunnels with the respective access
   routers in those networks.  Thus, in the event of a mobile moving to
   a candidate target network other than that was chosen as the target
   network, it will not be subjected to packet loss due to
   authentication and IP address acquisition delay that could occur if
   the mobile did not pre-authenticate with that candidate target
   network.  It may appear that by pre-authenticating with a number of
   candidate target networks and reserving the IP addresses, the mobile
   is reserving resources that could be used otherwise.  But since this
   happens for a time-limited period it should not be a big problem; it
   depends upon the mobility pattern and duration.  The mobile uses a
   pre-authentication procedure to obtain an IP address proactively and
   to set up the time bound tunnels with the access routers of the
   candidate target networks.  Also, MN may retain some or all of the
   nCoAs for future movement.

   The mobile may choose one of these addresses as the binding update
   address and send it to the CN (Correspondent Node) or HA (Home
   Agent), and will thus receive the tunneled traffic via the target
   network while in the previous network.  But in some instances, the
   mobile may eventually end up moving to a network that is other than
   the target network.  Thus, there will be a disruption in traffic as
   the mobile moves to the new network since the mobile has to go
   through the process of assigning the new IP address and sending the
   binding update again.  There are two solutions to this problem.  The
   mobile can take advantage of the simultaneous mobility binding and
   send multiple binding updates to the corresponding host or HA.  Thus,
   the corresponding host or HA forwards the traffic to multiple IP
   addresses assigned to the virtual interfaces for a specific period of
   time.  This binding update gets refreshed at the CH after the mobile
   moves to the new network, thus stopping the flow to the other
   candidate networks.  RFC 5648 [RFC5648] discusses different scenarios
   of mobility binding with multiple care-of-addresses.  In case
   simultaneous binding is not supported in a specific mobility scheme,
   forwarding of traffic from the previous target network will help take
   care of the transient traffic until the new binding update is sent
   from the new network.

7.3.  Proactive IP address acquisition

   In general a mobility management protocol works in conjunction with
   the Foreign Agent or in co-located address mode.  The MPA approach
   can use both co-located address mode and foreign agent address mode.
   We discuss here the address assignment component that is used in co-
   located address mode.  There are several ways a mobile node can
   obtain an IP address and configure itself.  In some cases, a mobile
   can configure itself statically in the absence of any configuration
   element such as a server or router in the network.  In a LAN



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   environment the mobile can obtain an IP address from DHCP servers.
   In case of IPv6 networks, a mobile has the option of obtaining the IP
   address using stateless auto-configuration or DHCPv6.  In some wide
   area networking environment, the mobile uses PPP (Point-to-Point
   Protocol) to obtain the IP address by communicating with a NAS.

   Each of these processes takes of the order of few hundred
   milliseconds to few seconds depending upon the type of IP address
   acquisition process and operating system of the clients and servers.
   Since IP address acquisition is part of the handover process, it adds
   to the handover delay and thus it is desirable to reduce this delay
   as much as possible.  There are few optimized techniques such as DHCP
   Rapid Commit [RFC4039], GPS-coordinate based IP address [GPSIP]
   available that attempt to reduce the handover time due to IP address
   acquisition time.  However, in all these cases the mobile also
   obtains the IP address after it moves to the new subnet and incurs
   some delay because of the signaling handshake between the mobile node
   and the DHCP server.

   In FastMIP6 [RFC5568], through the RtSolPr and PrRtAdv messages, the
   MN also formulates a prospective new CoA (NCoA) when it is still
   present on the PAR's link.  Hence, the latency due to new prefix
   discovery subsequent to handover is eliminated.  However, in this
   case, both the previous access router (PAR) and the next access
   router (NAR) need to cooperate with each other to be able to retrieve
   the prefix from the target network.

   In the following paragraph we describe few ways a mobile node can
   obtain the IP address proactively from the CTN and the associated
   tunnel setup procedure.  These can broadly be divided into four
   categories such as PANA-assisted proactive IP address acquisition,
   IKE-assisted proactive IP address acquisition, proactive IP address
   acquisition using DHCP only and stateless autoconfiguration.When DHCP
   is used for address configuration, a DHCP server is assumed to be
   serving one subnet.

7.3.1.  PANA-assisted proactive IP address acquisition

   In case of PANA-assisted proactive IP address acquisition, the mobile
   node obtains an IP address proactively from a CTN.  The mobile node
   makes use of PANA [RFC5191] messages to trigger the IP address
   acquisition process via a DHCP client that is colocated with the PANA
   authentication agent in the access router in the CTN acting on behalf
   of the mobile.  Upon receiving a PANA message from the mobile node,
   the DHCP client on the authentication agent performs normal DHCP
   message exchanges to obtain the IP address from the DHCP server in
   the CTN.  This address is piggy-backed in a PANA message and is
   delivered to the mobile.  In case of IPv6 Router Advertisment (RA) is



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   carried as part of PANA message.  In case of stateless
   autoconfiguration, the mobile uses the prefix(es) obtained as part of
   RA and its MAC address to construct the unique IPv6 address(es) as it
   would have done in the new network.  In case of stateful address
   configuration, te procedure similar to DHCPv4 can be applied.

7.3.2.  IKEv2-assisted proactive IP address acquisition

   IKEv2-assisted proactive IP address acquisition works when an IPsec
   gateway and a DHCP relay agent are resident within each access router
   in the CTN.  In this case, the IPsec gateway and DHCP relay agent in
   a CTN help the mobile node acquire the IP address from the DHCP
   server in the CTN.  The MN-AR key established during the pre-
   authentication phase is used as the IKEv2 pre-shared secret needed to
   run IKEv2 between the mobile node and the access router.  The IP
   address from the CTN is obtained as part of standard IKEv2 procedure,
   with using the co-located DHCP relay agent for obtaining the IP
   address from the DHCP server in the target network using standard
   DHCP.  The obtained IP address is sent back to the client in the
   IKEv2 Configuration Payload exchange.  In this case, IKEv2 is also
   used as the tunnel management protocol for a proactive handover
   tunnel (see Section 7.4).  Alternatively VPN-GW can itself dispense
   the IP address from its IP address pool.

7.3.3.  Proactive IP address acquisition using DHCPv4 only

   As another alternative, DHCP may be used for proactively obtaining an
   IP address from a CTN without relying on PANA or IKEv2-based
   approaches by allowing direct DHCP communication between the mobile
   node and the DHCP relay or DHCP server in the CTN.  The mechanism
   described in this section is applicable to DHCPv4 only.  The mobile
   node sends a unicast DHCP message to the DHCP relay agent or DHCP
   server in the CTN requesting an address, while using the address
   associated with the current physical interface as the source address
   of the request.

   When the message is sent to the DHCP relay agent, the DHCP relay
   agent relays the DHCP messages back and forth between the mobile node
   and the DHCP server.  In the absence of a DHCP relay agent the mobile
   can also directly communicate with the DHCP server in the target
   network.  The broadcast option in the client's unicast DISCOVER
   message should be set to 0 so that the relay agent or the DHCP server
   can send the reply directly back to the mobile using the mobile
   node's source address.

   In order to prevent malicious nodes from obtaining an IP address from
   the DHCP server, DHCP authentication should be used or the access
   router should install a filter to block unicast DHCP message sent to



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   the remote DHCP server from mobile nodes that are not pre-
   authenticated.  When DHCP authentication is used, the DHCP
   authentication key may be derived from the MPA-SA established between
   the mobile node and the authentication agent in the candidate target
   network.

   The proactively obtained IP address is not assigned to the mobile
   node's physical interface until the mobile has moved to the new
   network.  The IP address thus obtained proactively from the target
   network should not be assigned to the physical interface but rather
   to a virtual interface of the client.  Thus, such a proactively
   acquired IP address via direct DHCP communication between the mobile
   node and the DHCP relay or the DHCP server in the CTN may be carried
   with additional information that is used to distinguish it from other
   addresses as assigned to the physical interface.

   Upon the mobile's entry to the new network, the mobile node can
   perform DHCP over the physical interface to the new network to get
   other configuration parameters such as the SIP server, DNS server by
   using DHCP INFORM.  This should not affect the ongoing communication
   between the mobile and correspondent host.  Also, the mobile node can
   perform DHCP over the physical interface to the new network to extend
   the lease of the address that was proactively obtained before
   entering the new network.

   In order to maintain the DHCP binding for the mobile node and keep
   track of the dispensed IP address before and after the secure
   proactive handover, the same DHCP client identifier needs to be used
   for the mobile node for both DHCP for proactive IP address
   acquisition and DHCP performed after the mobile node enters the
   target network.  The DHCP client identifier may be the MAC address of
   the mobile node or some other identifier.

7.3.4.  Proactive IP address acquisition using stateless
        autoconfiguration

   For IPv6, a network address is configured either using DHCPv6 or
   stateless autoconfiguration.  In order to obtain the new IP address
   proactively, the router advertisement of the next hop router can be
   sent over the established tunnel, and a new IPv6 address is generated
   based on the prefix and MAC address of the mobile.  Generating a COA
   from the new network will avoid the time needed to obtain an IP
   address and perform Duplicate Address Detection.

   Duplicate address detection and address resolution are part of the IP
   address acquisition process.  As part of the proactive configuration
   these two processes can be done ahead of time.  Details of how these
   two processes can be done proactively are described in Appendix A and



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   Appendix B, respectively.

   In case of stateless autoconfiguration, the mobile checks to see the
   prefix of the router advertisement in the new network and matches it
   with the prefix of newly assigned IP address.  If these turn out to
   be the same then the mobile does not go through the IP address
   acquisition phase again.

7.4.  Tunnel management

   After an IP address is proactively acquired from the DHCP server in a
   CTN or via stateless autoconfiguration in case of IPv6, a proactive
   handover tunnel is established between the mobile node and the access
   router in the CTN.  The mobile node uses the acquired IP address as
   the tunnel's inner address.

   There are several reasons why this transient tunnel is established
   between the NAR and the mobile in the old PoA, unlike transient
   tunnel in FMIPv6 (Fast MIPv6) [RFC5568], where it is set up between
   mobile's new point of attachment and the old access router.

   In case of inter-domain handoff, it is important that any signaling
   message between nPoA and the mobile needs to be secured.  This
   transient secured tunnel provides the desired functionality including
   the securing the proactive binding update and transient data between
   the end-points before the handover has taken place.  Unlike proactive
   mode of FMIPv6, transient handover packets are not sent to PAR, and
   thus a tunnel between mobile's new point of attachment and old access
   router is not needed.

   In case of inter-domain handoff, PAR and NAR could logically be far
   from each other.  Thus, the signaling and data during pre-
   authentication period will take a longer route, and thus, may be
   subjected to longer one-way-delay.  Hence, MPA provides a tradeoff
   between larger packet loss or larger one-way-packet delay for a
   transient period, when the mobile is preparing to handoff.

   The proactive handover tunnel is established using a tunnel
   management protocol.  When IKEv2 is used for proactive IP address
   acquisition, IKEv2 is also used as the tunnel management protocol.
   Alternatively, when PANA is used for proactive IP address
   acquisition, PANA may be used as the secure tunnel management
   protocol.

   Once the proactive handover tunnel is established between the mobile
   node and the access router in the candidate target network, the
   access router also needs to perform proxy address resolution (Proxy
   ARP) on behalf of the mobile node so that it can capture any packets

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   destined to the mobile node's new address.

   Since the mobile needs to be able to communicate with the
   correspondent node while in the previous network some or all parts of
   binding update and data from the correspondent node to mobile node
   need to be sent back to the mobile node over a proactive handover
   tunnel.  Details of these binding update procedure are described in
   Section 7.5.

   In order for the traffic to be directed to the mobile node after the
   mobile node attaches to the target network, the proactive handover
   tunnel needs to be deleted or disabled.  The tunnel management
   protocol used for establishing the tunnel is used for this purpose.
   Alternatively, when PANA is used as the authentication protocol the
   tunnel deletion or disabling at the access router can be triggered by
   means of PANA update mechanism as soon as the mobile moves to the
   target network.  A link-layer trigger ensures that the mobile node is
   indeed connected to the target network and can also be used as the
   trigger to delete or disable the tunnel.  A tunnel management
   protocol also triggers the router advertisement (RA) the from next
   access router to be sent over the tunnel, as soon as the tunnel
   creation is complete.

7.5.  Binding Update

   There are several kinds of binding update mechanisms for different
   mobility management schemes.

   In case of Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6, the mobile performs a binding
   update with the home agent only, if route optimization is not used.
   Otherwise, the mobile performs binding update with both the home
   agent (HA) and corresponding node (CN).

   In case of SIP-based terminal mobility, the mobile sends binding
   update using INVITE to the correspondent node and REGISTER message to
   the Registrar.  Based on the distance between the mobile and the
   correspondent node, the binding update may contribute to the handover
   delay.  SIP-fast handover [SIPFAST] provides several ways of reducing
   the handover delay due to binding update.  In case of secure
   proactive handover using SIP-based mobility management we do not
   encounter the delay due to binding update completely, as it takes
   place in the previous network.

   Thus, this proactive binding update scheme looks more attractive when
   the correspondent node is too far from the communicating mobile node.
   Similarly, in case of Mobile IPv6, the mobile sends the newly
   acquired CoA from the target network as the binding update to the HA
   and CN.  Also all signaling messages between MN and HA and between MN



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   and CN are passed through this proactive tunnel that is set up.
   These messages include Binding Update (BU), Binding Acknowledgement
   (BA) and the associated return routability messages such as Home Test
   Init (HoTI), Home Test (HoT), Care-of Test Init (CoTI), Care-of Test
   (COT).  In Mobile IPv6, since the receipt of on-link router
   advertisement is mandatory for the mobile to detect the movement and
   trigger the binding update, router advertisement from next access
   router needs to be advertised over the tunnel.  By proper
   configuration on NAR, router advertisement can be sent over the
   tunnel interface to trigger the proactive binding update.  The mobile
   also needs to make the tunnel interface the active interface, so that
   it can send the binding update using this interface as soon as it
   receives the router advertisement.

   If the proactive handover tunnel is realized as an IPsec tunnel, it
   will also protect these signaling messages between the tunnel end
   points and will make the return routability test secured as well.
   Any subsequent data will also be tunneled through as long as the
   mobile is in the previous network.  The accompanying document
   [mpa-wireless] talks about the details of how binding updates and
   signaling for return routability are sent over the secured tunnel.

7.6.  Preventing packet loss

7.6.1.  Packet loss prevention in single interface MPA

   For single interface MPA, there may be some transient packets during
   link-layer handover that are directed to the mobile node at the old
   point of attachment before the mobile node is able to attach to the
   target network.  Those transient packets can be lost.  Buffering
   these packets at the access router of the old point of attachment can
   eliminate packet loss.  Dynamic buffering signals that are signalled
   from the MN can temporarily hold transient traffic during handover
   and then these packets can be forwarded to the MN once it attaches to
   the target network.  A detailed analysis of buffering technique can
   be found in [PIMRC06].

   An alternative method is to use bicasting.  Bicasting helps to
   forward the traffic to two destinations at the same time.  However,
   it does not eliminate packet loss if link-layer handover is not
   seamlessly performed.  On the other hand, buffering does not reduce
   packet delay.  While packet delay can be compensated by a playout
   buffer at the receiver side for streaming application, a playout
   buffer does not help much for interactive VoIP application that
   cannot tolerate for large delay jitters.  Thus it is still important
   to optimize the link-layer handover anyway.

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


7.6.2.  Preventing packet losses for multiple interfaces

   MPA usage in multi-interface handover scenarios involves preparing
   the second interface for use via the current active interface.  This
   preparation involves pre-authentication and provisioning at a target
   network where the second interface would be the eventual active
   interface.  For example, during inter-technology handover from a
   Wi-Fi to a CDMA network, pre-authentication at the CDMA network can
   be performed via the Wi-Fi interface.  The actual handover occurs
   when the CDMA interface becomes the active interface for the MN.

   In such scenarios, if handover occurs while both interfaces are
   active, there is generally no packet loss since transient packets
   directed towards the old interface will still reach the MN.  However,
   if sudden disconnection of the current active interface is used to
   initiate handover to the prepared interface then transient packets
   for the disconnected interface will be lost while the MN attempts to
   be reachable at the prepared interface.  In such cases, a specialized
   form of buffering can be used to eliminate packet loss where packets
   are merely copied at an access router in the current active network
   prior to disconnection.  If sudden disconnection does occur, copied
   packets can be forwarded to the MN once the prepared interface
   becomes the active reachable interface.  The copy-and-foward
   mechanism is not limited to multi-interface handover.

   A notable side-effect of this process is the possible duplication of
   packets during forwarding to the new active interface.  Several
   approaches can be employed to minimize this effect.  Relying on upper
   layer protocols such as TCP to detect and eliminate duplicates is the
   most common approach.  Customized duplicate detection and handling
   techniques can also be used.  In general, packet duplication is a
   well known issue that can also be handled locally by the MN.

   If the mobile takes a longer amount of time to detect the
   disconnection event of the current active interface, it can also have
   an adverse effect on the length of the handover process.  Thus it
   becomes necessary to use an optimized scheme of detecting interface
   disconnection in such scenarios.  Use of the current interface to
   perform pre-authentication instead of the new interface is desirable
   in certain circumstances, such as to save battery power or in cases
   where the adjacent cells (e.g., WiFi, and CDMA) are non-overlapping
   or in cases when the carrier does not allow simultaneous use of both
   interfaces.  However, in certain circumstances, depending upon the
   type of target network, only parts of MPA operations can be performed
   (e.g., pre-authentication, pre-configuration, proactive binding
   update).  In a specific scenario involving handoff between WiFi and
   CDMA network, some of the PPP context can be set up during the pre-
   authentication period, thus reducing the time for PPP activation.

7.6.3.  Reachability test

   In addition to previous techniques, the MN may also want to ensure
   reachability of the new point of attachment before switching from the
   old one.  This can be done by exchanging link-layer management frames
   with the new point of attachment.  This reachability check should be
   performed as quickly as possible.  In order to prevent packet loss
   during this reachability check, transmission of packets over the link
   between the MN and old point of attachment should be suspended by
   buffering the packets at both ends of the link during the
   reachability check.  How to perform this buffering is out of scope of
   this document.  Some of the results using this buffering scheme are
   explained in the accompanying implementation document.

7.7.  Security and mobility

7.7.1.  Link-layer security and mobility

   Using the MPA-SA established between the mobile node and the
   authentication agent for a CTN, during the pre-authentication phase,
   it is possible to bootstrap link-layer security in the CTN while the
   mobile node is in the current network in the following way.  Figure 5
   shows the sequence of operation.

   (1) The authentication agent and the mobile node derives a PMK (Pair-
   wise Master Key) [RFC5247] using the MPA-SA that is established as a
   result of successful pre-authentication.  Successful operation of EAP
   and an AAA protocol may be involved during pre-authentication to
   establish the MPA-SA.  From the PMK, distinct TSKs (Transient Session
   Keys) [RFC5247] for the mobile node are directly or indirectly
   derived for each point of attachment of the CTN.

   (2) The authentication agent may install the keys derived from the
   PMK and used for secure association to points of attachment.  The
   derived keys may be TSKs or intermediary keys from which TSKs are
   derived.

   (3) After the mobile node chooses a CTN as the target network and
   switches to a point of attachment in the target network (which now
   becomes the new network for the mobile node), it executes a secure
   association protocol such as the IEEE 802.11i 4-way handshake
   [802.11] using the PMK in order to establish PTKs (Pair-wise
   Transient Keys) and GTKs (Group Transient Keys) [RFC5247] used for
   protecting link-layer packets between the mobile node and the point
   of attachment.  No additional execution of EAP authentication is
   needed here.

   (4) While the mobile node is roaming in the new network, the mobile

   node only needs to perform a secure association protocol with its
   point of attachment point and no additional execution of EAP
   authentication is needed either.  Integration of MPA with link-layer
   handover optimization mechanisms such as 802.11r can be archived this
   way.

   The mobile node may need to know the link-layer identities of the
   point of attachments in the CTN to derive TSKs.

                Figure 5: Bootstrapping Link-layer Security

7.7.2.  IP layer security and mobility

   IP layer security is typically maintained between the mobile and
   first hop router or any other network element such as SIP proxy by
   means of IPsec.  This IPSec SA can be set up either in tunnel mode or
   in ESP mode.  However, as the mobile moves, the IP address of the
   router and outbound proxy will change in the new network.  The
   mobile's IP address may or may not change depending upon the mobility
   protocol being used.  This will warrant re-establishing a new
   security association between the mobile and the desired network
   entity.  In some cases such as in 3GPP/3GPP2 IMS/MMD environment data
   traffic is not allowed to pass through unless there is an IPsec SA



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   established between the mobile and outbound proxy.  This will of
   course add unreasonable delay to the existing real-time communication
   during mobile's movement.  In this scenario, key exchange is done as
   part of SIP registration that follows a key exchange procedure called
   AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement).

   MPA can be used to bootstrap this security association as part of
   pre-authentication via the new outbound proxy.  Prior to the
   movement, if the mobile can pre-register via the new outbound proxy
   in the target network and completes the pre-authentication procedure,
   then the new SA state between the mobile and new outbound proxy can
   be established prior to the movement to the new network.  A similar
   approach can also be applied if a key exchange mechanism other than
   AKA is used or the network element with which the security
   association has to be established is different than an outbound
   proxy.

   By having the security association established ahead of time, the
   mobile does not need to involve in any exchange to set up the new
   security association after the movement.  Any further key exchange
   will be limited to renew the expiry time.  This will also reduce the
   delay for real-time communication as well.

7.8.  Authentication in initial network attachment

   When the mobile node initially attaches to a network, network access
   authentication would occur regardless of the use of MPA.  The
   protocol used for network access authentication when MPA is used for
   handover optimization can be a link-layer network access
   authentication protocol such as IEEE 802.1X or a higher-layer network
   access authentication protocol such as PANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a framework of a secure handover optimization
   mechanism based on performing handover-related signaling between a
   mobile node and one or more candidate target networks to which the
   mobile node may move in the future.  This framework involves
   acquisition of the resources from the CTN as well as data packet
   redirection from the CTN to the mobile node in the current network
   before the mobile node physically connects to one of those CTN.

   Acquisition of the resources from the candidate target networks must
   be done with appropriate authentication and authorization procedures
   in order to prevent an unauthorized mobile node from obtaining the
   resources.  For this reason, it is important for the MPA framework to
   perform pre-authentication between the mobile node and the candidate



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 32]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   target networks.  The MN-CA key and the MN-AR key generated as a
   result of successful pre-authentication can protect subsequent
   handover signaling packets and data packets exchanged between the
   mobile node and the MPA functional elements in the CTN's.

   The MPA framework also addresses security issues when the handover is
   performed across multiple administrative domains.  With MPA, it is
   possible for handover signaling to be performed based on direct
   communication between the mobile node and routers or mobility agents
   in the candidate target networks.  This eliminates the need for a
   context transfer protocol [RFC5247] for which known limitations exist
   in terms of security and authorization.  For this reason, the MPA
   framework does not require trust relationship among administrative
   domains or access routers, which makes the framework more deployable
   in the Internet without compromising the security in mobile
   environments.

Appendix A.  Proactive duplicate address detection

   When the DHCP server dispenses an IP address, it updates its lease
   table, so that this same address is not given to another client for
   that specific period of time.  At the same time the client also keeps
   a lease table locally so that it can renew when needed.  In some
   cases where a network consists of both DHCP and non-DHCP enabled
   clients, there is a probability that another client in the LAN may
   have been configured with an IP address from the DHCP address pool.
   In such scenario the server detects a duplicate address based on ARP
   (Address Resolution Protocol) or IPv6 Neighbor Discovery before
   assigning the IP address.  This detection procedure may take from 4
   sec to 15 sec [MAGUIRE] and will thus contribute to a larger handover
   delay.  In case of a proactive IP address acquisition process, this
   detection is performed ahead of time and thus, does not affect the
   handover delay at all.  By performing the duplicate address detection
   ahead of time, we reduce the IP address acquisition time.

   The proactive duplicate address detection (DAD) over the candidate
   target network should be performed by the NAR on behalf of the mobile
   at the time of proactive handover tunnel establishment since
   duplicate address detection over a tunnel is not always performed.
   For example, in the case of IPv6, DAD over an IP-IP tunnel interface



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 38]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   is turned off in an existing implementation.  In the case of IPv6
   over PPP [RFC5172], IPCPv6 negotiates the link local addresses and
   hence DAD over the tunnel is not needed.  After the mobile has moved
   to the target network, a DAD procedure may be started because of
   reassignment of the nCoA to the physical interface to the target
   network.  In that case, the mobile should use optimistic DAD
   [RFC4429] over the physical interface so that the nCoA that was used
   inside the proactive handover tunnel before handover can be
   immediately used over that physical interface after handover.  The
   schemes used for the proactive DAD and optimistic DAD are applicable
   to both stateless and stateful address autoconfiguration schemes used
   for obtaining a nCoA.


Appendix B.  Address resolution

   Address resolution involves updating next access router's neighbor
   cache.  We briefly describe these two operations below.

   During the process of pre-configuration, the MAC address resolution
   mappings needed by the mobile node to communicate with nodes in the
   target network after attaching to the target network can also be
   known, where the communicating nodes maybe the access router,
   authentication agent, configuration agent and correspondent node.
   There are several possible ways of performing such proactive MAC
   address resolution.

   o  Use an information service mechanism [802.21] to resolve the MAC
      addresses of the nodes.  This might require each node in the
      target network to be involved in the information service so that
      the server of the information service can construct the database
      for proactive MAC address resolution.

   o  Extend the authentication protocol used for pre-authentication or
      the configuration protocol used for pre-configuration to support
      proactive MAC address resolution.  For example, if PANA is used as
      the authentication protocol for pre-authentication, PANA messages
      may carry AVPs used for proactive address resolution.  In this
      case, the PANA authentication agent in the target network may
      perform address resolution for on behalf of the mobile node.

   o  One can also make use of DNS to map the MAC address of the
      specific interface associated with a specific IP address of the
      network element in the target network.  One may define a new DNS
      resource record (RR) to proactively resolve the MAC addresses of
      the nodes in the target network.  But this approach may have its
      own limitations since a MAC address is a resource that is bound to
      an IP address, not directly to a domain name.



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 39]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   When the mobile node attaches to the target network, it installs the
   proactively obtained address resolution mappings without necessarily
   performing address resolution queries for the nodes in the target
   network.

   On the other hand, the nodes that reside in the target network and
   are communicating with the mobile node should also update their
   address resolution mappings for the mobile node as soon as the mobile
   node attaches to the target network.  The above proactive address
   resolution methods could also be used for those nodes to proactively
   resolve the MAC address of the mobile node before the mobile node
   attaches to the target network.  However, this is not useful since
   those nodes need to detect the attachment of the mobile node to the
   target network before adopting the proactively resolved address
   resolution mapping.  A better approach would be integration of
   attachment detection and address resolution mapping update.  This is
   based on gratuitously performing address resolution [RFC5944],
   [RFC3775] in which the mobile node sends an ARP Request or an ARP
   Reply in the case of IPv4 or a Neighbor Advertisement in the case of
   IPv6 immediately after the mobile node attaches to the new network so
   that the nodes in the target network can quickly update the address
   resolution mapping for the mobile node.


Appendix C.  MPA Deployment Issues

   In this section we describe some of the deployment issues related to
   MPA.

C.1.  Considerations for failed switching and switch-back

   The ping-Pong effect is one of the common problems found during
   handover.  The Ping-pong effect arises when a mobile is located at
   the borderline of the cell or decision point and a handover procedure
   is frequently executed.  This results in higher call drop
   probability, lower connection quality, increased signaling traffic
   and waste of resources.  All of these affect mobility optimization.
   Handoff algorithms are the deciding factors for performing the
   handoff between the networks.  Traditionally these algorithms employ
   a threshold to compare the values of different metrics to decide on
   the handoff.  These metrics include signal strength, path loss,
   carrier-to-interference ratios (CIR), Signal to Interference Ratios
   (SIR), Bit Error Rate (BER), power budget.  In order to avoid the
   ping-pong effect, some additional parameters are employed by the
   decision algorithm such as hystereris margin, dwell timers, and
   averaging window.  For a vehicle moving with a high speed, other
   parameters such as distance between the mobile node and the point of
   attachment, velocity of the mobile, location of the mobile, traffic



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 40]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   and bandwidth characteristics are also taken into account to reduce
   the ping-pong effect.  Most recently there are other handoff
   algorithms that help reduce the ping-pong effect in a heterogeneous
   network environment that are based on techniques such as hypothesis
   testing, dynamic programming and pattern recognition techniques.
   While it is important to devise smart handoff algorithms to reduce
   the ping-pong effect, it is also important to devise methods to
   recover from this effect.

   In the case of the MPA framework, the ping-pong effect will result in
   the back-and-forth movement of the mobile between the current network
   and target network and between the candidate target networks.  MPA in
   its current form will be affected because of a number of tunnels
   setup between the mobile and neighboring access routers, number of
   binding updates and associated handoff latency resulting out of ping-
   pong situation.  The mobile's handoff rate may also contribute to
   delay and packet loss.  We propose few techniques that will help
   reduce the probability of ping-pong and propose several methods for
   the MPA framework so that it can recover from the packet loss
   resulting out of the ping-pong effect.

   The MPA framework can take advantage of the mobile's geo-location
   with respect to APs in the neighboring networks using GPS.  In order
   to avoid the oscillation between the networks, a location-aware
   algorithm can be derived by using a co-relation between user's
   location and cached data from the previous handover attempts.  In
   some cases only location may not be the only indicator for a handoff
   decision.  For example in Manhattan type grid networks, although a
   mobile is close to an AP, it may not have enough SNR (Signal to Noise
   Ration) to make a good connection.  Thus knowledge of mobility
   pattern, dwell time in a call and path identification will help avoid
   the ping-pong problem to a great extent.

   In the absence of a good handoff algorithm that can avoid ping-pong
   effect, it may be required to put in place a good recovery mechanism
   so as to mitigate the effect of ping-pong.  It may be necessary to
   keep the established context in the current network for a period of
   time, so that it can be quickly recovered when the mobile comes back
   to the network where the context was last used.  This context may
   include security association, IP address used, tunnels established.
   Bicasting the data to both the previous network and the new network
   for a predefined period will also help the mobile to take care of the
   lost packets in case the mobile moves back and forth between the
   networks.  The mobile can also take certain action, after it
   determines that it is in a stable state with respect to a ping-pong
   situation.

   When the MPA framework takes advantage of a combination of IKEv2 and



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 41]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   MOBIKE, the ping-pong effect can be reduced further [mpa-mobike].

C.2.  Authentication state management

   In case of pre-authentication with multiple target networks, it is
   useful to maintain the state in the authentication agent of each of
   the neighboring networks for certain time.  Thus, if the mobile does
   move back and forth between neighboring networks, already maintained
   authentication state can be helpful.  We provide some highlights on
   multiple security association state management below.

   A mobile node that has pre-authenticated with an authentication agent
   in a candidate target network and has a MPA-SA, may need to continue
   to keep the MPA-SA while it continues to stay in the current network
   or even after it does handover to a network that is different from
   the candidate target network.

   When an MN that has been authenticated and authorized by an
   authentication agent in the current network makes a handover to a
   target network, it may want to hold the SA that has been established
   between the MN and the authentication agent for a certain time period
   so that it does not have to go through the entire authentication
   signaling to create an SA from scratch in case it returns to the
   previous network.  Such an SA being held at the authentication agent
   after the MN's handover to other network is considered as an MPA-SA.
   In this case, the authentication agent should change the fully
   authorized state for the MN to an unauthorized state.  The
   unauthorized state can be changed to the fully authorized state only
   when the MN comes back to the network and provides a proof of
   possession of a key associated with the MPA-SA.

   While an MPA-SA is being held at an authentication agent, the MN will
   need to keep updating the authentication agent when an IP address of
   the MN changes due to a handover to re-establish the new SA.

C.3.  Pre-allocation of QoS resources

   In the pre-configuration phase, it is also possible to pre-allocate
   QoS resources that may be used by the mobile node not only after
   handover but also before handover.  When pre-allocated QoS resources
   are used before handover, it is used for application traffic carried
   over a proactive handover tunnel.

   It is possible that QoS resources are pre-allocated in an end-to-end
   fashion.  One method to achieve this proactive end-to-end QoS
   reservation is to execute NSLP [RFC5974] or RSVP [RFC2205] over a
   proactive handover tunnel where pre-authentication can be used for
   bootstrapping a security association for the proactive handover



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 42]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   tunnel to protect the QoS signaling.  In this case, QoS resources are
   pre-allocated on the path between the correspondent node and a target
   access router can be used continuously before and after handover.  On
   the other hand, duplicate pre-allocation of QoS resources between the
   target access router and the mobile node is necessary when using pre-
   allocated QoS resources before handover due to difference in paths
   between the target access router and the mobile node before and after
   handover.  QoS resources to be used for the path between the target
   access router and the mobile node after handover may be pre-allocated
   by extending NSLP to work for off-path signaling (Note: this path can
   be viewed as off-path before handover) or by media-specific QoS
   signaling at layer 2.

C.4.  Resource allocation issue during pre-authentication

   In case of multiple CTNs, establishing multiple tunnels with the
   neighboring target networks provides some additional benefits.  But
   it also contributes to some resource utilization issues as well.  A
   pre-authentication process with multiple candidate target networks
   can happen in several ways.

   The very basic scheme involves authenticating the mobile with the
   multiple authentication agents in the neighboring networks, but
   actual pre-configuration and binding update take place only after
   layer 2 movement to a specific network is complete.

   Similarly, in addition to pre-authentication, the mobile can also
   complete the pre-configuration while in the previous network, but can
   postpone the binding update until after the mobile has moved.  Like
   the previous case, in this case the mobile also does not need to set
   up the pre-configured tunnels.  While the pre-authentication process
   and part of the pre-configuration process are taken care of before
   the mobile has moved to the new network, binding update is actually
   done after the mobile has moved.

   The third type of multiple pre-authentication involves all the three
   steps while the mobile is in the previous networks, such as
   authentication, configuration and binding update.  But, this specific
   process utilizes the most amount of resources.  Some of the resources
   that get used during this process are as follows:

   1)Additional signaling for pre-authentication in the neighboring
   networks

   2)Holding the IP address of the neighboring networks in mobiles cache
   for certain amount of time.  It needs additional processing in the
   mobile for storing these IP addresses.  In addition it also uses up
   the temporary IP addresses from the neighboring routers.



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 26, 2011               [Page 43]

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   3)There is an additional cost associated with setting up additional
   transient tunnels with the target routers in the neighboring networks
   and mobile.

   4) In case of binding update with multiple IP addresses obtained from
   the neighboring networks, multiple transient streams flow between the
   CN and mobile using these transient tunnels.

   When only pre-authentication and pre-configuration are done ahead of
   time with multiple networks, the mobile sends one binding update to
   the CN.  In this case it is important to find out when to send the
   binding update after the layer 2 handoff.

   In case binding update with multiple contact addresses is sent,
   multiple media streams stem out of CN using the transient tunnels.
   But in that case one needs to send another Binding Update after the
   handover with the contact address set to the new address (only one
   address) where the mobile has moved.  This way the mobile stops
   sending media to other neighboring networks where the mobile did not
   move.

   The following is an illustration of this specific case that takes
   care of multiple binding streams, when the mobile moves only to a
   specific network, but sends multiple binding updates in the previous
   network.  MN sends a binding update to CH with multiple contact
   addresses such as c1,c2, and c3 that were obtained from three
   neighboring networks.  This allows the CN to send transient multiple
   streams to the mobile over the pre-established tunnels.  After the
   mobile moves to the actual network, it sends another binding update
   to the CN with the care-of-address of the mobile in the network where
   the mobile has moved in.  Some of the issues with multiple streams
   are consumption of extra bandwidth for a small period of time.

   Alternatively, one can apply the buffering technique at the target
   access router or at the home agent.  Transient data can be forwarded
   to the mobile after it has moved in.  Forwarding of data can be
   triggered by the mobile either as part of Mobile IP registration or
   as a separate buffering protocol.

C.5.  Systems evaluation and performance results

   In this Section, we present some of the results from MPA
   implementation when applied to different handover scenarios.  We
   present the summary of results from our experiments using MPA
   techniques for two types of handovers I) Intra-technology and Intra-
   domain, II) Inter-technology and Inter-domain.  We also present the
   results from how MPA can bootstrap layer 2 security for both roaming
   and non-roaming cases.  Detailed procedure and results are explained

   For all measurement, we did not experience any performance
   degradation during handover in terms of the audio quality of the
   voice traffic.

   With the use of buffering during handover, packet loss during the
   actual L2 and L3 handover is eliminated with an appropriate and
   reasonable settings of the buffering period for both MIP6 and SIP
   mobility.  In the case of MIP6, there is not a significant difference
   in results with and without route optimization.  It should be noted
   that results with more samples would be necessary for a more detailed
   analysis.

   In case of non-MPA assisted handover, handover delay and associated
   packet loss occurs from the moment the link-layer handover procedure
   begins up to successful processing of the binding update.  During
   this process, IP address acquisitions via DHCP incurs the longest
   delay.  This is due to the detection of duplicate IP address in the
   network before DHCP request completes.  Binding update exchange also
   experiences long delay if the CN is too far from the MN.  As a
   result, the Non-MPA assisted handover took an average of 4 seconds to

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   complete with an approximate packet loss of about 200 packets.  The
   measurement is based on the same traffic rate and traffic source as
   the MPA assisted handover.

C.5.2.  Inter-technology, Inter-domain

   Handoff involving heterogeneous access can take place in many
   different ways.  We limit the experiment to two interfaces and
   therefore results in several possible setup scenarios depending upon
   the activity of the second interface.  In one scenario, the second
   interface comes up when the link to the first interface goes down.
   This is a reactive scenario and usually gives rise to undesirable
   packet loss and handoff delay.  In a second scenario, the second
   interface is being prepared while the mobile still communicates using
   the old interface.  Preparation of the second interface should
   include setup of all the required state and security associations
   (e.g., PPP state, LCP, CHAP).  If such lengthly process is
   established ahead of time, it reduces the time taken for the
   secondary interface to be attached to the network.  After
   preparation, the mobile decides to use the second interface as the
   active interface.  This results in less packet loss as it uses make-
   before-break techniques.  This is a proactive scenario and can have
   two flavors.  The first is where both interfaces are up and the
   second is when only the old interface is up the prepared interface is
   brought up only when handoff is about to occur.  This scenario may be
   beneficial from a battery management standpoint.  Devices that
   operate two interfaces simultaneously can rapidly deplete their
   batteries.  However, by activating the second interface only after an
   appropriate network has been selected the client may utilize battery
   effectively.

   As compared to non-optimized handover that may result in delay up to
   18 sec and 1000 packet loss during handover from WLAN to CDMA, we
   observed 0 packet loss, and 50 ms handoff delay between the last pre-
   handoff packet and first in-handoff packet.  This handoff delay
   includes the time due to link down detection and time needed to
   delete the tunnel after the mobile has moved.  However, we observed
   about 10 duplicate packets because of the copy-and-forward mechanism
   at the access routers.  But these duplicate packets are usually
   handled easily by the upper layer protocols.

C.5.3.  MPA-assisted Layer 2 pre-authentication

   In this section, we discuss the results obtained from MPA-assisted
   layer 2 pre-authentication and compare these with EAP authentication
   and IEEE 802.11i's pre-authentication techniques.  Figure 12 shows
   the experimental testbed where we have conducted the MPA-assisted
   pre-authentication experiment for bootstrapping layer 2 security as

Internet-Draft                MPA Framework                February 2011


   explained in Section 7.  By pre-authenticating and pre-configuring
   the link, the security association procedure during handoff reduces
   to a 4-way handshake only.  Then MN moves to the AP and, after
   association, runs a 4-way handshake by using the PSKap (Pre-shared
   Key at AP) generated during PANA pre-authentication.  At this point
   the handoff is complete.  Details of this experimental testbed can be
   found in [MOBIQUIT07].

                                 (Roaming)

   We have experimented with three types of movement scenarios involving
   both non-roaming and roaming cases using the testbeds shown in
   figures 12 and 13, respectively.  In the roaming case, MN is visiting
   in a domain different than its home domain.  Consequently, the AAAh
   needs to be contacted which is placed in a location far from the
   visiting domain.  For the non-roaming case, we assume the MN is
   moving within its home domain and only the local AAA server (AAAHome)
   is contacted which is the home AAA server for the mobile.

   The first scenario does not involve any pre-authentication.  The MN
   is initially connected to AP0 and moves to AP1.  Because neither
   network-layer authentication is enabled nor IEEE 802.11i pre-
   authentication is used, the MN needs to engage in a full EAP
   authentication with AP1 to gain access to the network after the move
   (post-authentication).  This experiment shows the effect of absence
   of any kind of pre-authentication.

   The second scenario involves 802.11i pre-authentication and involves
   movement between AP1 and AP2.  In this scenario, the MN is initially
   connected to AP2, and starts IEEE 802.11i pre-authentication with
   AP1.  This is an ideal scenario to compare the values obtained from
   802.11i pre-authentication with that of network-layer assisted pre-
   authentication.  Both scenarios use RADIUS as AAA protocol (APs
   implement a RADIUS client).  The third scenario takes advantage of
   network layer assisted link-layer pre-authentication.  It involves
   movement between two APs (e.g., between AP0 and AP1) that belong to
   two different subnets where 802.11i pre-authentication is not
   possible.  Here, Diameter is used as AAA protocol (PAA implements a
   Diameter client).

   In this third movement scenario, the MN is initially connected to
   AP0.  The MN starts PANA pre-authentication with the PAA which is co-
   located on the AR in the new candidate target network (nAR in network
   A) from the current associated network (network B).  After
   authentication, PAA proactively installs two keys, PSKap1 and PSKap2
   in both AP1 and AP2 respectively.  By doing the key installations
   proactively, it preempts the process of communicating with AAA server
   for the keys after the mobile moves to the new network.  Finally,
   because PSKap1 is already installed, AP1 starts immediately the 4-way
   handshake.  We have used measurement tools such as ethereal and
   kismet to analyze the measurements for the 4-way handshake and PANA
   authentication.  These measurements reflect different operations
   involved during network-layer pre-authentication.

   In our experiment, as part of the discovery phase, we assume that the
   MN is able to retrieve PAA's IP address and all required information
   about AP1 and AP2 (e.g. channel, security-related parameters, etc.)
   at some point before the handover.  This avoids the scanning during

   link-layer handoff.  We have applied this assumption to all three
   scenarios.  Because our focus is on reducing the time spent on
   authentication part during handoff, we do not discuss the details of
   how we avoid the scanning.

            Figure 10: Results of MPA-assisted Layer 2 results

   Figure 14 shows the timing (rounded off to the most significant
   number) associated with some of the handoff operations we have
   measured in the testbed.  We describe each of the timing below.
   Tauth refers to the execution of EAP-TLS authentication.  This time
   does not distinguish whether this authentication was performed during
   pre-authentication or a typical post-authentication.

   Tconf refers to time spent during PSK generation and installation
   after EAP authentication is complete.  When network-layer pre-
   authentication is not used, this time is not considered.

   Tassoc+4way refers to the time dedicated to the completion of
   association and the 4-way handshake with the target AP after the
   handoff.

C.6.  Guidelines for handover preparation

   In this section, we provide some guidelines for the roaming clients
   that use pre-authentication mechanisms to reduce the handoff delay.
   These guidelines can help determine the extent of pre-authentication
   operation that is needed based on a specific type of movement of the
   client.  IEEE 802.11i and 802.11r take advantage of preauthentication
   mechanism at layer 2.  Thus, many of the guidelines observed for
   802.11i-based pre-authentication and 802.11r-based fast roaming could
   also be applicable to the clients that use MPA-based pre-
   authentication techniques.  However, since MPA operations are not
   limited to a specific subnet and involve inter-subnet and inter-
   domain handover the guidelines need to take into account other
   factors such as movement pattern of the mobile, cell size etc.

   The time needed to complete pre-authentication mechanism is an
   important parameter since the mobile node needs to determine how much
   ahead of time the mobile needs to start the pre-authentication
   process so that it can finish the desired operations before the
   handover to the target network starts.  The pre-authentication time
   will vary depending upon the speed of the mobile (e.g., pedestrian,
   vs. vehicular) and cell sizes (e.g., WiFi, Cellular).  Cell residence
   time is defined as the average time the mobile stays in the cell
   before the next handoff takes place.  Cell residence time is
   dependent upon the coverage area and velocity of the mobile.  Thus,
   cell residence time is an important factor in determining the
   desirable pre-authentication time that a mobile should consider.

   Since pre-authentication operation involves six sub-operations as
   described in Section 7.2 and each sub-operation takes some discrete
   amount of time, only part of these sub-operations may be completed
   before handoff depending upon the available delay budget.

   For example, a mobile could complete only network discovery and
   network layer authentication process before the handoff and postpone
   the rest of the operations to until after the handover is complete.
   On the other hand if it is a slow moving vehicle and the adjacent
   cells are sparsely spaced, a mobile could complete all the desired
   MPA related operations.  Finishing all the MPA related operations
   ahead of time reduces the handoff delay but adds other constraints
   such as cell residence time.

   We give a numerical example here similar to [IEEE-03-084].

   D= Coverage diameter,

   v= Mobile's velocity,

   RTT = round trip time from AP to AAA server including processing time
   for authentication Tauth

   Tpsk = Time spent to install keys proactively on the target APs

   If for a given value of D = 100ft, Tpsk = 10 ms, and RTT = 100 ms, a
   mobile needs to execute only the pre-authentication procedure
   associated with MPA, then the following can be calculated for a
   successful MPA procedure before the handoff is complete.

   2RTT+Tpsk < D/v

   v = 100 ft/(200 ms +10 ms) = ~500 ft/sec

   Similarly, for a similar cell size, if the mobile is involved in both
   pre-authentication and pre-configuration operations as part of the
   MPA procedure, and it takes an amount of time Tconfig= 190 ms to
   complete the layer 3 configuration including IP address
   configuration, then for a successful MPA operation,

   2RTT+Tpsk+Tconfig < D/v

   v = 100 ft /(200 ms + 10 ms + 190 ms) = ~250 ft/sec

   Thus, compared to only pre-authentication part of MPA operation, in
   order to be able to complete both pre-autentication and pre-
   configuration operations successfully, either the mobile needs to
   move at a slower pace or it needs to expedite these operations for
   this given cell size.  Thus, types of MPA operations will be
   constrained by the velocity of the mobile.

   As an alternative if a mobile does complete all the pre-
   authentication procedure much ahead of time, it uses up the resources
   accordingly by way of extra IP address, tunnel and extra bandwidth.
   Thus, there is always a tradeoff between the performance benefit
   obtained from pre-authentication mechanism and network
   characteristics, such as movement speed, cell size, and resources
   utilized.

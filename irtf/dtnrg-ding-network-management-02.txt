           DING Protocol -- A Protocol For Network Management
              draft-irtf-dtnrg-ding-network-management-02

Abstract

   This memo describes the Diagnostic Interplanetary Network Gateway
   protocol (DING).  DING is a subscription-based network management
   protocol designed specifically for use in situations where SNMP's
   request / response model does not perform well, e.g. in heavily
   delayed and / or disrupted networks.

Internet-Draft           DING Network Management           February 2010


1.  Introduction

   Over the past 20 years, SNMP has firmly established itself as the de
   facto standard protocol for network management.  There are SNMP
   agents available for everything from network switches to
   supercomputers.  Further, the protocol works extremely well on most
   (if not all) terrestrial networks.

   In delay tolerant networks (DTNs), however, SNMP tends to perform
   poorly.  The request / response mechanism SNMP uses does not seem
   practical in environments where transmission delays can range from
   minutes to days; by the time a query has made it to a remote host and
   back again, the information contained in the response is often too
   old to be relevant to the device's status at the current point in
   time.

   Furthermore, in many delay-tolerant networks, there are often severe
   restrictions in place on the amount of bandwidth available to a given
   device.  While SNMP is not an inefficient protocol, there are areas
   where existing knowledge about a device could be utilized to
   drastically reduce the size of SNMP requests and replies.

   The Diagnostic Interplanetary Network Gateway (DING) protocol
   described in this document has been designed to address these issues.
   Rather than use the request / reply paradigm employed by SNMP, DING
   relies on a subscription model.

   When a host wishes to receive information about a remote node, the
   host (called a "subscriber") sends that node (called a "provider") a
   "subscription request".  This request consists of two parts: a
   "schema" and a "schedule".

   The "schema" is a static data model definition that defines exactly
   which data the subscriber wishes to receive from the provider.  This
   schema consists solely of a list of object identifiers (OIDs).  The
   provider, upon examining the schema, parses this list of OIDs and
   compares each OID to a list of known OIDs it has.  If the OID matches
   a piece of information it knows how to provide, the provider will
   transmit that information as instructed by the schedule included with
   the subscription request.  If the provider does not know how to
   translate a given OID into data, the provider will assign 0 to any
   field where that OID is requested.

   The "schedule" contains two things: a time interval and a set of
   conditions.  The conditions determine when a provider sends a
   scheduled frame: the provider will only send a scheduled frame if all
   conditions are met (the expression provided in the schedule frame
   evaluates to true).  If no conditions are specified, then the

Internet-Draft           DING Network Management           February 2010


   provider assumes that there are no conditions to meet and will
   transmit scheduled frames as determined by the time interval.

   The time interval itself (specified in seconds) determines how often
   to transmit "scheduled frames" (sets of data encoded using a given
   schema).  As soon as the conditions in a schedule are met, a single
   scheduled frame is transmitted, and then an additional scheduled
   frame is transmitted every time_interval seconds.  If the time
   interval is set to be zero, then the scheduled frame is sent only
   when the specified conditions are met and is never repeated.

   When a provider sends a scheduled frame to a subscriber as described
   by a schema, the scheduled frame includes a "Schema ID" which can be
   used by the subscriber to uniquely identify the schema associated
   with that scheduled frame.  It also includes a "Schedule ID" which
   can be used to identify the schedule that triggered the frame.
   Assuming Schema IDs are used and agreed upon by both the provider and
   the subscriber, data can be encoded far more efficiently than it
   would be if encoded in the standard BER and DER formats used by SNMP.
   If further compression is desired, DING supports specifying that data
   has been compressed; see sections 4.3 and 4.4 of this document for
   details.

   DING is designed to operate in conjunction with a gateway.  This
   gateway is designed to act as a kind of SNMP proxy for DTN nodes.  To
   do this, the gateway subscribes to a number of DING providers running
   on a DTN and caches scheduled frames received from each provider.
   The gateway also runs an SNMP agent which uses this cached
   information to respond to SNMP GET messages and generate SNMP TRAP
   messages.  The motivation for and operation of this gateway will be
   explored further in a separate draft (currently a work in progress).

3.  Service Definitions

   Frame - A collection of consecutive bytes organized into a single
   logical unit.

   Provider - A machine that provides a service which processes
   subscription requests from and sends scheduled frames to subscribers.

   Registration - The act of sending a subscription request to a
   provider.

   Removal Request - Request to remove a certain schema from a provider
   (so that the provider will quit using that schema along with any
   associated schedules to send scheduled frames to a subscriber) and /
   or remove a certain schedule from a provider.

   Schedule - Links a schema with a time interval and a set of
   conditions.  Assuming that all conditions described in a schedule are
   met, the provider is expected to send a scheduled frame every [time
   interval] seconds.

   Scheduled Frame - A frame sent by a provider to a subscriber as
   directed by the "schedule" portion of a subscription request.  The
   content of this data is described by the "schema" portion of a
   subscription request.  A scheduled frame may be associated with a
   corresponding schema and / or subscription request through the use of
   a schema ID.

   Scheduled Frame Container - A container meant to transport one or
   more scheduled frames from a provider to a subscriber.

   Scheduled Frame Entry - A single scheduled frame contained within a
   "Scheduled Frame Container".

   Schema - A static data model which is included in a subscription
   request and defines exactly which pieces of data the subscriber is
   requesting from the provider.

   Schema ID - A sequence of bytes which can be used to uniquely
   identify a given schema.  This documents suggests computing an SHA-1
   hash of the schema to compute this value, although the particular
   method is not as important as is A) ensuring that both subscriber and
   provider agree on an ID and B) ensuring ID is as unique as possible.

   Self-Delimiting Numeric Value (SDNV) - Encoding for a positive
   integer.  Supports numbers of any size through the use of a scheme
   similar to that used within BER to encode OIDs into numeric values.
   See RFC 5050 for a complete explanation of SDNVs and their usage.

   Subscriber - A machine which has sent a subscription request to a
   provider.

   Unsubscribe - Sending a "removal request" to a provider so that
   provider will quit sending certain scheduled frames to a given
   subscriber.

4.  Subscription Requests

4.1.  Subscription Request Overview

   A subscription request is composed of the following fields:

   o  Type -- Four bit field consisting of the value '0110'.

   o  Options -- Set of options applying to every field contained within
      this subscription request. 4-bit field.  The following options are
      supported:


                                   0 1 2 3
                                  +-+-+-+-+
                                  |C|H|S|E|
                                  |M|S|C|X|
                                  |P|H|A|T|
                                  +-+-+-+-+

                              Figure 1: Options

      *  CMP -- Compression bit.  If set, the schema is compressed.  The
         format is encoded as a one-byte number in the options data.
         The following options must be supported:

         +  0 -- No compression.

         +  1 -- GZIP format.

         Additional options may be supported assuming both subscriber
         and provider agree on a common association between number and
         compression scheme.

      *  HSH -- Hash bit.  If set, the provider should run a specified
         hash algorithm on each included schema and verify that the
         resulting hash matches the specified schema's ID.  This is
         designed to be used as a simple data integrity check, and could
         perhaps be used as a part of a simple authentication scheme as
         well.  The algorithm to use is specified by the first byte of
         the options data section (HSHDATA).  The following options must
         be supported:

         +  0 -- No hash; IDs of all included schemas are assumed to be
            0.  Using this option is not recommended, but may be
            necessary for some devices depending on hardware
            specifications and / or bandwidth requirements.

Internet-Draft           DING Network Management           February 2010


         +  1 -- CRC; 16 bit.  Using this option is not recommended, but
            may be necessary for some devices depending on hardware
            specifications and / or bandwidth requirements.

         +  2 -- MD5; 128 bit digest.

         +  3 -- SHA-1; 160 bit digest.

         When the hash option is specified, the size of the schema ID
         field must be the same size as the size of the digest produced.
         When the hash bit is not specified, the schema ID field must
         have a size of 20 bytes.

      *  SCA -- Scaling bit.  If this bit is set, NSC and NSM will both
         be multiplied by an SDNV provided in the option data.

      *  EXT -- Extension bit.  If this bit is set, then the option data
         contains an SDNV integer of value X (after the hash byte and
         compression byte, if either and / or both are present),
         followed by X bytes of data.  This is to allow the inclusion of
         additional options, should the need arise.

   o  Option Data -- Data necessary to support any option bits set in
      the Options field.  Up to three bytes in length unless EXT bit is
      set, at which point the size of this field is unknown.

   o  Number of Schemas (NSM) -- 4 bits encoding number of schemas
      included with this request.  Up to 16 * SCA.

   o  Number of Schedules (NSC) -- 4 bits encoding number of schedules
      included with this request.  Up to 16 * SCA.

   o  Schema X (SMX) -- schema number X in a sequence of NSM consecutive
      schema fields.  Unknown total length, but there can be no more
      than NSchma schemas included with a single subscription request.

   o  Schedule X (SCX) -- schedule number X in a sequence of NSC
      consecutive schedule fields.  Unknown total length, but there can
      be no more than NSched schedules included with a single
      subscription request.

4.2.  Schema Section

4.2.1.  Schema Format

   A schema is composed of an X-bit ID unique ID, followed by a list of
   SDNV / OID pairs.  Each SDNV specifies the depth of a particular OID
   from the root of the OID tree (.1 = 1, .3.2.4 = 3, .6.1.4.7.24 = 5,
   etc), and each OID is encoded in standard DER format.  The last entry
   in a schema must consist of a single "OID_DEPTH" field with a value
   of 0.


+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+
|  SCHEMA_ID  |   |  OID_DEPTH  |   |  OID  |   |  OID_DEPTH  |   | OID |   | 0 |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+

                          Figure 3: Schema Format

   Given the nature of DTN, it is a distinct possibility that a request
   to remove a schema from a system may arrive before the schema itself.
   Thus, requests for the removal of a schema that does not yet exist
   should be held for some time, where the exact definition of "some
   time" is left up to the system implementing this protocol.

   If a schema is received with a Schema ID that matches the Schema ID
   of a schema already stored, the newest schema may be either stored
   (while waiting for a removal request) or silently discarded.  Note
   that if a schema arrives with a Schema ID and length that matches any
   removal request currently queued by the system, that schema should be
   immediately discarded.

4.2.2.  Schema / SNMP Compatibility Note

   In an effort to provide some compatibility between DING and SNMP, a
   schema may be stored locally on a host as a MIB encoded in standard
   ASN.1/SMIng format.  To convert a MIB into a schema, a provider or
   subscriber should extract each leaf OID defined within the MIB.  Once
   the provider or subscriber has done this, they may simply use this
   list of OIDs as a schema.  Note that the order these OIDs appear in
   the schema must match the order in which they were defined in the
   corresponding MIB.

4.2.3.  OID Compression

   [Need to do literature review here; found draft on SNMP Payload
   Compression by Schoenwaelder et. al.]

   [How do OID compression algorithms compare to "standard" compression
   algorithms e.g.  GZIP / BZIP2?]

4.3.  Schedule Section

4.3.1.  Schedule Overview

   A schedule is composed of an X-bit schema ID, an SDNV-encoded
   schedule ID, an SDNV-encoded interval value, and a set of conditions
   (an expression).


         +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+
         | SCHEMA_ID |   |  SCHED_ID |   | INTERVAL  |   | EXPR  |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 4: Schedule Format

   The SCHEMA_ID must refer to an existing schema (which may be defined
   by the current subscription request or exist previously); if this
   field refers to an unknown schema, the provider may choose to A)
   ignore the schedule request or B) hold the schedule request for an
   unknown time in the hopes of receiving a relevant schema.

   The SCHED_ID is an SDNV which can be used, in conjunction with the
   schema ID, to uniquely reference this schedule.

   The INTERVAL is a time interval, specified in seconds and encoded as
   an SDNV.  Assuming all conditions are met, this value specifies the
   amount of time the provider should wait between each scheduled frame
   it transmits.

Internet-Draft           DING Network Management           February 2010


   EXPR is an expression (a set of conditions) that determine whether or
   not a scheduled frame should be transmitted.  Each condition is
   composed of a single operator (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &&, ||) and two
   operands, where an operand can be an OID, a constant, or a condition.

   o  If an operand is an OID, the value of any sensors associated with
      that OID should be inserted into the expression when the
      expression is evaluated.  If a provider does not have a sensor
      associated with a given OID, the OID should be treated as the
      integer '0'.

   o  An expression must evaluate to be either TRUE or FALSE.

   o  If the value of an expression changes from FALSE to TRUE, a
      scheduled frame should be immediately sent unless a scheduled
      frame has already been sent within the last INTERVAL seconds.

   o  Example: .3.2.7.4 <= 4 && .3.2.7.5 > .3.2.7.4

   o  [*** TODO *** : Specify how EXPR is encoded in schedule data (e.g.
      NOT plaintext).  Specify BNF.  Perhaps move conditions to its own
      section?]

4.4.  Example Subscription Request

   NOTE: This is a contrived example; the OIDs used here are not valid,
   and are used for the sole purpose of saving space.  Also, the schema
   ID here is not necessarily valid.

   Assume a satellite (the provider) knows that OID .92.2.3.1
   corresponds to a thermal sensor and that OID .92.2.3.2 corresponds to
   a battery charge sensor.  A subscriber sends a subscription request
   to this satellite, with the following OIDs listed in the schema
   portion of the subscription request:


        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+
        | 0xf73492aaecb |   |  4  |  .92.2.3.1  |   |  4  |  .92.2.3.2  |   | 0 |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+

                     Figure 5: Example Schema Section

   This schema says every scheduled frame that the satellite sends with
   a Schema ID corresponding to that of this schema (0xf73492aaecb) will
   contain two data values: the data from the thermal sensor and the
   data from the battery charge sensor.

   The schedule part of the subscription request looks like:

           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 6: Example Schedule Section

   The schedule says that scheduled frames with a format corresponding
   to this schema with ID 0xf73492aaecb will be sent every 30 minutes
   (108000 seconds) ONLY IF the value corresponding to .92.2.3.1 (in
   this case, the reading from the thermal sensor) is greater than 120.

5.  Scheduled Frames

5.1.  Scheduled Frame Container Overview

   A scheduled frame container is composed of the following fields:

   o  Type -- Four bit field consisting of the value '0111'.

   o  Options -- Set of options applying to every field contained within
      this scheduled frame. 4 bit field.  The following options are
      supported:


                                   0 1 2 3
                                  +-+-+-+-+
                                  |C|U|S|E|
                                  |M|N|C|X|
                                  |P|U|A|T|
                                  +-+-+-+-+

                              Figure 7: Options

      *  CMP -- Compression bit.  If set, all data within the scheduled
         frame is compressed.  The format is encoded as a one-byte
         number in the options data.  The following options must be
         supported:

         +  0 -- No compression.

         +  1 -- GZIP format.

         Additional options may be supported assuming both subscriber
         and provider agree on a common association between number and
         compression scheme.

      *  UNU -- Unused bit.  The value of this bit must be ignored.

      *  SCA -- Scaling bit.  If this bit is set, NSF will be multiplied
         by an SDNV provided in the option data.

      *  EXT -- Extension bit.  If this bit is set, then the option data
         contains an SDNV integer of value X (after the hash byte and
         compression bytes, if either and / or both are present),
         followed by X bytes of data.  This is to allow the inclusion of
         additional options, should the need arise.

   o  Option Data -- Data necessary to support any option bits set in
      the Options field.  Up to two bytes in length unless EXT bit is
      set, at which point the size of this field is unknown.

   o  Number of Scheduled Frames (NSF) -- 8 bits encoding number of
      entries included within this scheduled frame.  Up to 256.

   o  Scheduled Frame X (SFX) -- scheduled frame number X in a sequence
      of NSF consecutive scheduled frame fields.

   Example scheduled frame container header (assuming CMP = 0, SCA = 0,
   EXT = 0):

                    0                   1
                    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                   |  TYPE | OPTN  |      NSF      |
                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                   |       SFX [NSF entries]       |

5.2.  Scheduled Frame Entries

   Each individual scheduled frame entry within a scheduled frame
   container consists of the following fields:

   Schema ID -- ID of the schema that should be used to parse this data.
   Variable length field.

   Sched ID -- ID of the schedule that generated this scheduled frame.

   Data -- Data which corresponds to a schema.  Each 'Data' field in the
   schema corresponds to the value mapped from a single OID.


        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+
        |   SCHEMA_ID   |   | SCHED_ID  |   |    DATA   |   |    DATA   |   | ... |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+

5.3.  Scheduled Frame Entry Example

   Assuming a subscriber has registered with the provider described in
   the "Subscription Request Example" section, then an entry in the
   scheduled frame container originating from the provider (the

   satellite, in this case) might look like:


                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                   | 0xf73492aaecb |   |      170      |       252       |
                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 10: Satellite's Scheduled Frame Entry

   assuming that the thermal and charge sensors reported values of 170
   and 252, respectively.

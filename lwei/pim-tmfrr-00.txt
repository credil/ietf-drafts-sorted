Abstract

   This specification defines simple extensions to PIM to support Tunnel
   based Multicast Fast Reroute (TMFRR) utilizing different tunnel
   technologies.  This mechanism allows protection of native IP
   multicast traffic against link or node failures, with minimal traffic
   interruption, compared with situations relying on unicast and
   multicast route convergence.  The repair for link or node failure
   happens locally near the point of failure.  This version of
   specification addresses PIM-SM and SSM traffic protection.

2.  Introduction

   This document proposes a mechanism to support tunnel based fast
   reroute protection for IP multicast traffic.  The tunnel is routed
   around the susceptible link or node, and set up when multicast
   routing state is established.  When a failure is detected, traffic is
   redirected from the primary interface to the backup tunnel without
   waiting for routing to converge.

   To allow setting up of such a tunnel, an upstream router of the
   protected link or node needs information about the router downstream
   of the link or node under protection.

   For link protection, the tunnel end points are on two PIM neighbor
   routers.  The tunnel setup information is conveyed via two new PIM
   hello options,

   For node protection, the tunnel setup information is first conveyed
   via the PIM hello options from the downstream router to the node
   under protection, then propagated one more hop, via a new PIM join
   attribute [RFC5384] to the RPF neighbor of the protected node.

   This work has been revised and enhanced from prior work [NFRR]
   [PIM-NNHOP] that extended RSVP-TE and PIM to do fast reroute
   protection of IP multicast traffic.  In comparison, this proposal
   does not require RSVP-TE extension, and can utilize either a MPLS or
   an IP tunnel.

2.1.  Terminology

   The following defines the terms used in this draft.

   TMFRR:   Tunnel based multicast fast reroute.

   Point of Local Repair (PLR):   The router or node that redirects
      traffic to the preset backup path when a failure in the primary
      path is detected.

   Merge Point (MP):   The router where the traffic from the backup path
      gets "merged" back into the original forwarding path.

   Protected IP address:   The IP address on the MP's interface for the
      link under protection, or on the link leading to the node under
      protection.

   Multicast route:   A (S,G) or (*,G) entry in ASM or SSM mode.

   TMFRR label:   The MPLS label a MP allocates for a protected link or

3.  Link Protection

   The following picture depicts a protected multi-access link in
   between PIM routers MP1, MP2 and PLR.


                               ------
                     ----------| R1 |---------
                     |         ------        |
                     |                       |
                  ----- A   |                |
       Rcv1 .. ---|MP1|-----| Protected      | D
                  -----     | Link         -----
                            |--------------|PLR|-----...  Source
                  ----- B   |            C -----
       Rcv2 .. ---|MP2|-----|                |
                  -----                      |
                     |         -----         |
                     ----------| R2|----------
                               -----

                         Figure 1: Link Protection

   MP1 and MP2 have downstream receivers for traffic from source.  Both
   can reach PLR along alternative reverse paths via R1 and R2
   respectively.  The backup tunnel can be any MPLS or IP tunnel.  The
   following discussion uses MP1 as an example.

   Each MP transmits its router ID in the PIM TMFRR hello option.  For
   each distinct router ID the PLR learns, it sets up a tunnel with
   itself as the source, and with the MP's router ID as the destination.
   This tunnel is routed around the IP address on the MP, such that it
   avoids going through the protected link or node.  The algorithm to
   route the backup path around the protected link is outside the scope
   of this specification.

   In order for the PLR to learn which multicast routes MP1 has joined
   and which ones MP2 has joined reliably, PIM Join suppression must be
   turned off on the protected link, and PIM explicit tracking of
   downstream joiners must be enabled on the PLR.

   After the tunnel is set up, if the PLR in Figure 1 detects failure on
   link C, the PLR stops forwarding traffic on interface C, and starts
   to forward traffic onto the backup tunnel.  Since interface C has
   gone done, the PLR's PIM implementation may remove it from the
   multicast route's outgoing interface list.  This may lead to a PIM
   prune being sent toward the source, disrupting traffic flowing into
   the backup tunnel.  To prevent this prune from interrupting traffic

Internet-Draft           TMFRR Extensions to PIM            October 2009


   that the backup tunnel needs for the duration of the repair, the PLR
   must hold off the transmission of this prune for PRUNE_HOLD_OFF
   seconds.  The default value for PRUNE_HOLD_OFF is TBD.

   When link C comes back up, the PLR adds it back to the outgoing
   interface list, and resumes forwarding traffic onto link C and stops
   forwarding traffic onto the backup tunnel.  An implementation may
   delay to switch back onto the primary path to avoid thrashing due to
   quick link flaps.

3.1.  MP Allocated Special Label

   An MP needs to accept and forward traffic received from the prmary
   RPF interface, and from the backup tunnel.  When a MP needs to
   receive traffic from a backup tunnel and to merge into the primary
   forwarding path, the MP needs to verify if the traffic was from a
   backup TMFRR tunnel.  To identify such packets, an MP allocates a
   MPLS label for each link it acts as MP for, and conveys that label to
   the PLR via the PIM TMFRR hello option.  This label is also referred
   to as the TMFRR label.  When the PLR sends traffic into the backup
   FRR tunnel, it pushes the TMFRR label onto the packet, before doing
   the tunnel encapsulation.  The MP caches the mapping between an RPF
   interface and its TMFRR label, and accepts packets with the TMFRR
   label as an alternative to a successful RPF check.

4.  Node Protection

   The following figure shows R as the node to be protected.  Similar to
   the link protection scenario in Section 3, there are two alternative
   path between the PLR and MP1, MP2.


                             ------
                   ----------| R1 |-------------------
                   |         ------                   |
                   |                                  |
                ----- A   |           Protected       |
     Rcv1 .. ---|MP1|-----|            Node           | D
                -----     | Link        -----        -----
                          |-------------| R |--------|PLR|----... Source
                ----- B   |             -----      C -----
     Rcv2 .. ---|MP2|-----|                           |
                -----                                 |
                   |         -----                    |
                   ----------| R2|---------------------
                             -----

                         Figure 2: Node Protection

   The MPs send PIM hellos with the TMFRR hello option, as described in
   Section 3.  R caches the router ID and TMFRR label for each MP.  When
   R sends a (*,G) or (S,G) join toward the PLR, it includes a TMFRR
   Join Attribute for each MP downstream.

   In order for router R to know which MP has joined which multicast
   route, PIM join suppression must be turned off on the link between
   MP1, MP2 and R. PIM explicit tracking must be turned on on router R.

   The operations of backup tunnel setup, and traffic redirect are
   similar to the link protection operations described in Section 3.
   Note that if a multicast route has receivers behind multiple MPs, as
   shown in the figure above, the PLR will set up multiple tunnels, one
   tunnel for each MP it has learned.

5.  The Effect of Downstream Routing Convergence

   When a link or a node protected by TMFRR fails, the multicast tree
   upstream of the PLR is intact for the PRUNE_HOLD_OFF period.
   However, the failure may result in a routing convergence event
   downstream of the MP and may cause that part of the multicast tree to
   route away from the failure point.  This will cause traffic
   interruption.

   To prevent this from happening, an end-to-end, make-before-break
   solution may be implemented at all routers downstream of the MP.  The
   make-before-break solution ensures that the new multicast tree is
   receiving traffic at the receiver before pruning off the old tree.
   The description of the make-before-break enhancement is outside the
   scope of this document.

6.  New PIM Extension

   This section defines the new TMFRR hello option and TMFRR join
   attribute.

6.1.  TMFRR Hello Option

   This option conveys the TMFRR setup of the sending router.  It has a
   short and a long format, determined by the value of the L bit.


      Short format,

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      OptionType = TBD         |     Length                    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |             Reserved                                    |N|M|L|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Long format,

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |      OptionType = TBD         |     Length                    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      TMFRR Label                       |   Reserved      |N|M|L|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Router ID  in  Encoded Unicast Address Format            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   OptionType:   to be assigned by IANA.

   Length:   4 + L * x where L is defined below, x is the size of the
      router ID field.

   L:   0 short format; 1 long format.

   Reserved:   Set to 0 when sent, ignored when received.

   N:   Node protection bit.  It is set to 0 for link protection on this
      interface, 1 for node protection.  This bit informs the downstream
      PIM neighbor if the sending router accepts TMFRR join attribute
      for node protection.

Internet-Draft           TMFRR Extensions to PIM            October 2009


   M:   MoFRR bit.  Set by MPs.  It is set to 1, if traffic must always
      be put on the backup tunnel.  It is set to 0 if traffic is put on
      backup tunnel only when primary link or node fails.

   TMFRR Label:   Locally assigned 20-bit MPLS label.  An MP must use
      the long format of this hello option, and offer a non-zero label
      value.

   Router ID in Encoded Unicast Address Format:   Router ID of the MP.
      It is the backup tunnel's destination address, and needs to be
      routeable from the PLR to the MP.  The encoded unicast address is
      specified in [RFC4601], in the following format,


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Addr Family  | Encoding Type |     Unicast Address
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...

      With this encoding format, it is possible to have multicast
      traffic protected by tunnel technology of a different address
      family.  E.g. a IPv6 multicast traffic stream can be protected by
      a traffic engineered IPv4 tunnel.

   A receiving router needs to cache all values in this option and
   associate them with the sending PIM neighbor.  These values are
   cached until the PIM neighbor expires, or when new values are
   received to replace the old ones.  These values are invalidated by a
   new PIM hello that does not contain a TMFRR option.  If the receiving
   router is a PLR, it must clean up its tunnel setup state for an old
   router ID before setting up state for the new backup tunnel.

6.2.  TMFRR Join Attribute

   The PIM Join attribute is described in [RFC5384].  The PIM TMFRR join
   attribute is introduced here to support node protection.  The
   protected node caches the MP's Router ID and a locally assigned label
   value for each MP, then transmits this set of information in the
   TMFRR join attribute to the PLR.  The following is the format of this
   new attribute.

   the Join/Prune message.

   F bit:   0 Non-Transitive Attribute.

   E bit:   As specified by [RFC5384].

   Attr Type:   To be assigned by IANA.

   Length:   Number of bytes in this join attribute.

   Reserved:   Set to 0 when sent, ignored when received.

   M-bit:   Copied from the M-bit in TMFRR hello option.

   TMFRR Label:   The label value to be conveyed to the PLR.  It is
      copied from the TMFRR option's label value field.

   Reserved2:   Set to 0 when sent, ignored when received.

   Router ID in Encoded Unicast Address Format :   Router ID of the MP.
      It is usually an address associated with a virtual interface, such
      as a loopback interface.

   Address of Downstream Interface Under Protection:  MP's address on
      interface connecting to the protected node.  The size of this
      field is determined by the address family of the source and group
      address in the same Join prune record.

   The PIM TMFRR join attribute may appear multiple times for the same
   multicast route, one for each MP downstream.

   The PIM TMFRR join attribute is uniquely identified by the MP's
   address on the interface connected to the protected node.  The values
   in the PIM TMFRR join attribute must be cached and associated with
   the corresponding multicast route, until the multicast route expires,
   or new values are received to replace the old values.  When a PIM
   join is received without a TMFRR join attribute for the same MP's
   interface address, all cached values in the TMFRR join attribute must
   be invalidated.

7.  Selective Traffic Protection by MP

   When there is a need to selectively protect only the more critical
   multicast flows, it is operationally more convenient to make the
   selection on the MP.  The selection needs to be conveyed to the PLR,
   which will redirect traffic to the backup tunnel only for the flows
   the MP has chosen.

   The MP can tag the selected multicast routes with a shortened TMFRR
   join attribute.  A new L bit is introduced to differentiate this
   format from the long format defined in Figure 3.  The receiver of
   this join message treats the presence of this attribute as indication
   that the multicast route is to be TMFRR protected.  The following is
   the short TMFRR join attribute format,


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |F|E| Attr Type | Length        |    Reserved               |L|M|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      L : Long format bit.
          0 for short format;
          1 for long format.


                  Figure 4: Extended TMFRR Join Attribute

   For link protection, the PLR associates the back up tunnel with the
   OIF for the multicast routes that had the TMFRR attribute attached in
   the previous join received.

   For node protection, in each multicast route, the node under
   protection (router R in figure Figure 2) keeps track of the set of
   MPs on the OIF that have the TMFRR attribute attached in the last
   join.  In the next PIM join sent to the PLR, R adds the TMFRR join
   attributes, in long format, for all MPs in the set.

7.1.  Selective Mode Operation on MP

   The selective mode of operation needs to co-exist with the general
   mode described in Section 3 and Section 4, where TMFRR is applied to
   all multicast flows for an MP.  The MP needs to tell the RPF neighbor
   via the TMFRR hello option which mode is in use.  Without such
   indication, a PLR may first apply TMFRR to all multicast flows, then
   receive the PIM join attributes to selectively apply TMFRR to a
   subset of the multicast flows.  The PLR will have to remove the

   association of other flows with the backup tunnel.

   Figure 5 shows the TMFRR hello option with the S-bit defined, for an
   MP to indicate whether it operates in selective mode.

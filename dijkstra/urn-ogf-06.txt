Internet-Draft          URN Namespace for the OGF              July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development
   organisation in the field of distributed computing.  The OGF produces
   documents such as working drafts, specifications, and schemata.  For
   more information, see http://www.ogf.org/

   Working groups in the OGF community have expressed the need for
   global, distributed, persistent identifiers in working drafts and
   standards.  Motivated by this need, the OGF would like to assign URNs
   to some resources in order to retain unique, permanent, location-
   independent names for them.

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  URN Specification for "ogf" NID

2.1.  Namespace ID

   "ogf" requested.

2.2.  Registration Information

   Registration Version Number: 1
   Registration Date: yyyy-mm-dd [[RFC-Editor1: Please replace with the
   date of approval of this document for publication as an RFC]]

2.3.  Declared registrant of the namespace

   Technical Director
   Open Grid Forum
   P.O. Box 2326
   Joliet, Illinois 60434
   USA
   http://www.ogf.org/
   Email: urn@ogf.org

   The position of technical director is currently fulfilled by Joel
   Replogle.

Internet-Draft          URN Namespace for the OGF              July 2011


2.4.  Declaration of syntactic structure

   The formal syntax definitions below are given in ABNF [RFC5234].

   The NSS in the urn:ogf names hierarchy begins with a subnamespace
   identifier (SNID), followed by a delimiter and a subnamespace-
   dependent string

      OGF-URN  =  "urn:ogf:" SNID ":" SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING

   where <SNID> is a unique subnamespace identifier for the
   specification, and <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> is a unique
   identifier within the subnamespace identifier scope.

   <SNID> has the same syntax as a <NID> as defined in [RFC2141]:

      SNID  =  ( ALPHA / DIGIT )  *31( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )

   ALPHA and DIGIT are defined in Appendix B of [RFC5234].

   The Technical Director at OGF (or their successors) assigns
   subnamespace identifiers (SNID).

   The syntax of <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> is dependent on the
   <SNID>, and MUST be defined by a Grid Forum Document [GFD-SERIES].
   This document does not pose any additional restrictions to the
   <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> other than what is defined in the NSS
   syntax as defined by [RFC2141] or its successor:

      SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN chars>

   <URN chars> is defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC2141].

2.5.  Relevant ancillary documentation

   The Technical Director at OGF (or their successors) will keep a list
   of assigned subnamespace identifiers and associated documentation at
   http://www.ogf.org/urn/ [URN-OGF].

   Information on the procedures how to register a subnamespace
   identifier can also be found at this website.

2.6.  Identifier uniqueness considerations

   Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Technical Director of
   the Open Grid Forum.

   The OGF Technical Director may sub-delegate part of the namespace to

   third parties.  It will not be permissible, neither by the OGF
   Technical Director nor any third party, to re-assign previously
   assigned URNs.  A practical consequence is that a previously assigned
   subnamespace can not be re-assigned, unless additional arrangements
   are made to prevent identifier re-assignements.

2.7.  Identifier persistence considerations

   The Technical Director will only assign subnamespace identifiers for
   persistent resources.

   In order to enforce identifier persistence for individual resources,
   each document defining subnamespace identifiers MUST contain a
   section on the type of resource that is specified (e.g. whether a URN
   in the subnamespace identifies a specific version of a resource, the
   latest version of a resource, a specific manifestation, or a more
   general concept)

2.8.  Process of identifier assignment

   Assignment of subnamespace identifiers is limited to the OGF and
   those authorities that are specifically designated by the OGF
   Technical Director.  OGF may assign portions of its namespace
   (specifically, those under designated subnamespace identifiers) for
   assignment by third parties.

   The details of this process is specified in [GFD-C.XXX].[[RFC-
   Editor2: Please hold publication of this RFC until the GFD-series
   number of this reference is assigned by the Open Grid Forum.]]

   The syntax and semantics of each subnamespace MUST be defined by a
   Grid Forum Document [GFD-SERIES] before the corresponding
   subnamespace identifier (SNID) is assigned.

2.9.  Process of identifier resolution

   The OGF namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery
   System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace prohibits the future
   definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing with an RDS.

   The OGF will maintain an index of all subnamespace identifiers on its
   Web site, http://www.ogf.org/urn/.  This list may refer to known
   Resolution Discovery System(s).

2.10.  Rules for Lexical Equivalence

   The <SNID> part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is case insensitive.
   Thus, the <SNID> MUST be case normalised before comparison.

Internet-Draft          URN Namespace for the OGF              July 2011


   The rules for lexical equivalence of the <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-
   STRING> part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is specific for each SNID
   and MUST be defined when a SNID is assigned by the OGF Technical
   Director.  These definitions MUST included information about case
   sensitivity, and in case %-escaped octets, MUST define the exact
   normalisation to use (e.g. interpret as octet, interpret as UTF-8,
   specify type of Unicode normalisation factor, etc.)

2.11.  Conformance with URN Syntax

   The intention of this document is to only restrict the syntax of the
   <SNID>.  The syntax of the <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> follows the
   general syntax of a URN:

      SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN chars>

   Documents defining a subnamespace identifier SHOULD specify further
   syntactic restrictions in <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that these documents forbid the assignment of URNs
   containing characters in the <reserved> set ("%", "/", "?", and "#")
   as defined in [RFC2141].  This is in accordance with section 2.2 of
   [RFC3986].

   For forward compatibility, it is RECOMMENDED that software
   implementations that don't validate subnamespace-specific strings,
   validate the syntax according to the generic rules for validating
   URIs, as defined in [RFC3986].  URIs may contain all characters
   defined in <URN chars>, including the characters in <reserved>
   (albeit they have a special meaning), as well the characters as "&"
   and "~".

2.12.  Validation mechanism

   The validation mechanism of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is specific for
   each SNID and SHOULD be defined when a SNID is assigned by the OGF
   Technical Director.

   URNs in the OGF hierarchy without an assigned SNID are considered to
   be invalid.

2.13.  Scope

   Global URNs, relevant for the distributed computing community in
   general, and the Open Grid Forum in particular.

3.  Examples (Informative)

   Since no subnamespace identifiers have been defined yet, no actual
   examples can be given.  Therefore, the following examples are not
   guaranteed to be real or even syntactically correct.

   Grid forum documents defining the "gfd" and "network" subnamespace
   identifiers may give the following examples.

   o  urn:ogf:gfd:136

   o  urn:ogf:network:canarie.ca:kisti-uninett-glif-001


4.  Namespace Considerations

   The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development
   organisation in the field of distributed computing.

   The use of the OGF hierarchy is expected to be broad, including but
   not limit to usage for:

   o  Grid Forum Documents

   o  XML (Extensible Markup Language) Schemata

   o  RDF (Resource Description Framework) Schemata

   The Open Grid Forum is dedicated to openly publish all technical
   documentation related to URNs in the OGF hierarchy and allow
   unlimited distribution of these documents.


5.  Community Considerations

   Members of the distributed computing community will benefit from
   persistent and globally unique identifiers for use in protocols
   developed by the Open Grid Forum.

   Practical use of the urn:ogf namespace has been detected, and a
   formal registration will allow the Open Grid Forum to document this
   usage and enforce technical review of current practices.


6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

   Implementers are recommended to check the OGF registry and
   documentation [URN-OGF] before assuming that a given identifier is
   valid or has a certain meaning.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is kindly requested to register the "ogf" namespace identifier
   (NID) at the URN Namespaces registry [URN-NAMESPACES] and refer to
   this document and/or the website http://www.ogf.org/urn/.

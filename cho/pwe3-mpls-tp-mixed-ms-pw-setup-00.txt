Abstract 

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) transport paths can be 
   statically provisioned via a Network Management System (NMS) or
   dynamically provisioned via a control plane. The transport paths 
   provided by MPLS-TP are used as a server layer for pseudowires 
   carrying client signals other than IP or MPLS. It may be necessary 
   to support MPLS-TP pseudowires, to extend across multiple domains.  
   
   This document outlines the requirements and solution for 
   coordinating MPLS-TP transport paths and a multi-segment PWs that
   will traverse multiple domains, where some domains are statically 
   provisioned, and other domains that are dynamically provisioned.
      
   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft        Mixed Multi-Segment PW Setup          April 2011


1. Introduction 

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is being defined in a joint
   effort between the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and
   the IETF.  The requirements for MPLS-TP are defined in the
   requirements document [RFC5654]. A general framework for MPLS-TP
   has been defined in [RFC5921].

   An MPLS-TP network can be operated via static provisioning of
   transport paths, or the elective use of GMPLS control plane to 
   support dynamic provisioning of transport paths. The MPLS-TP
   LSP control plane is based on GMPLS. The framework for MPLS-TP
   dynamic provisioning and is described in [MPLS-TP-CP]. 

   The LSPs provided by MPLS-TP are used as a server layer for 
   Pseudowires (PWs). The PWs are essential Communication Service 
   Providers (CSP) as they are used to carry client signals other than 
   IP or MPLS.

   It may be necessary to extend the reach of an MPLS-TP transport path,
   and PWs, across multiple domains. A domain can be defined as a 
   separate administrative, geographic, or switching environment within 
   the CSP network. Additionally a domain can also be categorized as a
   separate AS or IGP area.

   The MPLS-TP transport path would consist of two or more contiguous 
   MPLS-TP and PW segments, each segment would traverse a single domain. 
   The segments are concatenated so that they behave and function as a 
   single MPLS-TP transport and PW path. 

   For these multi-segment transport and PW paths the intermediate 
   segments, or domains, may be statically or dynamically provisioned. 
   There may be a requirement to automatically set up transport path 
   that will traverse multiple domains that are managed both statically 
   and dynamically. There must therefore be some coordination between 
   domains that are managed statically and dynamically to ensure the 
   end-to-end MPLS-TP transport path and PW are successfully setup.

   This document outlines the requirements and solution for 
   coordinating MPLS-TP transport paths and PWs and that will traverse 
   multiple domains, where some domains are statically provisioned, and 
   other domains are dynamically provisioned. 

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport 
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the 
   capabilities and functions of a packet transport network as defined 
   by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft        Mixed Multi-Segment PW Setup          April 2011


1.1 Statically Provisioned PWs across MPLS-TP

   A PW is a mechanism that carries a native service over an emulated 
   service from one PE to one or more other PEs over a PSN. [RFC3985],
   defines the signaling and encapsulation techniques for establishing
   Single-segment PW (SS-PWs) between a pair of terminating PEs.

1.2 Dynamically Provisioned PWs across MPLS-TP

   [MS-PW-DYN] describes the procedure and extensions to dynamically 
   place the segments of the Multi-segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) among a 
   set of PE routers. The dynamic PW capability is based on the 
   existing PW control plane [RFC4447], and the PW architecture 
   [RFC3985].

1.3 Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW)

   A set of two or more contiguous PW segments that behave and function 
   as a single point-to-point PW, can be considered a MS-PW. The 
   architecture for MS-PWs across multi-domain environments is described
   in [RFC5659]. 

   The switching points (S-PEs), in addition to the terminating (T-PEs),
   are manually provisioned for each segment. They are configured
   to direct the MPLS packets from one PW into the other. There is no
   control protocol involved in this case. 

   Dynamic end-to-end signaling of MS-PWs is achieved by using 
   information present in S-PEs to support the determination of the next
   PW signaling hop.  This selection information is disseminated via 
   inter-domain routing protocols (e.g. BGP).

   [RFC6073] describes a procedure for connecting multiple pseudowires
   together where each domain is dynamically provisioned. This procedure
   requires each S-PE to be manually configured with the information 
   required to terminate and initiate the Single-segment Pseudowire 
   (SS-PW) part of the Multi-segment Pseudowire (MS-PW). 

   The issue exists when an end-to-end PW is requested across domains
   that are comprised of both statically and dynamically configured. 

1.4 Multi-segment Pseudowire Path Selection

   An important feature of the establishment of a multi-domain multi-
   segment pseudowires is the determination of the path of the 
   pseudowire. That is, the selection of the LSP tunnels and PW
   switching points that the end-to-end PW will traverse.

Internet-Draft        Mixed Multi-Segment PW Setup          April 2011


   Selecting this path can be an off-line management task using 
   information gathered from a number of sources or pre-known by the
   management tools. Alternatively, the path can be selected dynamically
   using policy-based tools that operate on information gathered from 
   the network in a manner similar to existing MPLS traffic engineering
   mechanisms, and using routing protocols.

   However, in multi-domain environments there may be issues of
   confidentiality of network topology information. For example, one
   service provider may not wish to fully reveal the extent to which it 
   supports cross-domain LSP tunnels, or where its internal PW stitching
   points are. These issues significantly complicate the mechanisms
   available for selecting end-to-end multi-segment pseudowire paths.

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] was developed to 
   facilitate inter-domain path computation. The PCE uses topology
   and resource availability information to compute paths inside a
   domain. To support inter-domain path computation, PCEs responsible
   for different coordinate with each other to calculate end-to-end
   multi-domain paths.

   Cooperating PCEs could be used to compute end-to-end MPLS-TP 
   transport paths and the stitching points of PW segments. This
   document concentrates on the issues of signalling and not path 
   determination. The method and procedure of how this may be 
   achieved is not in scope of this document.

4. Problem Statement   

   The requirements and mechanisms for the establishment of MS-PWs are 
   given in [RFC6073]. This includes all of the signaling extensions to
   describe PW capabilities, the S-PEs and T-PEs to be navigated (i.e.,
   the PW path), and the identities of the ACs that the PW connects.

   However, when some of the segments are statically provisioned, there
   is a requirement to carry this PW information across the statically
   provisioned domains to make the information available in subsequent
   dynamically provisioned domains.
   
   For example, consider that in Figure 3, domains 1 and 2 are 
   dynamically provisioned, domain 3 is statically provisioned and 
   domain 4 is dynamically provisioned:
   
            Dyn       Dyn       Static       Dyn

          |<-----Multi-Segment Pseudowire------>|   
      
   Figure 3: Dynamic and Static Domain Topology
      
   The normal techniques of [RFC6073] can be used to request an 
   end-to-end MS-PW from B to H, and this can be signaled from B to E.
   
   Furthermore, S-PE E can select a statically pre-provisioned PW 
   segment from E to G to use as the next segment in the MS-PW. Node E
   can set up the necessary switching mechanisms for this connectivity.
   
   However, [RFC6073] does not describe how node G is informed about the
   end-to-end MS-PW or how G is triggered to resume dynamic signalling
   toward T-PE H. It is not just a simple trigger that is required, 
   because all of the PW configuration parameters signaled by T-PE B 
   must be conveyed in the signaling from G to H.
   
   This simple scenario can be further complicated by the existence of 
   multiple domains (static or dynamic in any sequence) along the path.

4.1 Requirements   

   The requirements for setting up end-to-end PWs across MPLS-TP 
   transport paths, across statically and dynamically provisioned
   domains, are document in [RFC5659], specific attention should be 
   given to:

   o End-to-end PW setup across the MPLS-TP LSP: the destination and BW
     requirements MUST be met.
   
   o Traffic engineering and QoS consistency: the PW traffic engineering
     and QoS requirements MUST be met.
   
   o Resiliency: when requested, the maintaining of mechanisms to
     protect a MS-PW when an element on the existing path of a MS-PW
     fails SHOULD be maintained. 

   PW resiliency is provided using end-to-end protection techniques. 
   That is, two path-diverse PWs are established to serve as working 
   and protected PWs.

   In a MS-PW environment, these two PWs must be kept path diverse 
   across the whole of their paths. Where the path of the PWs is 
   pre-planned, this can be archived within the scope of the management
   tool, and where both PWs are fully dynamic they can be established
   sequentially with the second PW having the awareness of the route 
   of the first PW.
   
   However, where there is a mix of static and dynamic segments, care 
   will be required to ensure that the end-to-end working and 
   protection MS-PWs follow diverse paths.
        

5. Procedures
   
   The following section describe the procedures to satisfy the
   problem and requirements specified in the previous section.  


6. Protocol Extensions

   Where possible existing control protocol and procedures will be 
   reused. However, to meet the setup and control of PWs over MPLS-TP 
   transport paths, that traverse statically and dynamically 
   provisioned domains, a set of new extensions of the existing control
   plane mechanisms are required. 
   
   This section will clarify the areas where PW control plane extensions
   are required.

Internet-Draft        Mixed Multi-Segment PW Setup          April 2011


7.  Security Considerations

   The MPLS-TP data plane does not provide any specific security 
   mechanisms. MS-PW connections that wish to secure data carried over
   MPLS-TP transport entities are REQUIRED to apply their own 
   security mechanisms.

   Where control plane protocols are used to dynamically install
   label switching operations necessary to establish MPLS-TP transport
   paths, those protocols are equipped with security features that
   network operators may use to securely create the transport paths.
   
   The use of static configuration exposes the CSP to another set of 
   security risks, compared to dynamic configuration. If an MPLS-TP 
   transport path is misconfigured in a statically configured network,
   it may result traffic looping and lack of end-to-end connectivity.
   
   Further details of MPLS and MPLS-TP security can be found in
   [RFC5921] and [RFC5920]. The PWE3 security considerations are
   described in [RFC3985].

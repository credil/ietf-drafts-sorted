Abstract

   It's been argued in the past and in some documents, such as RFC 3776,
   RFC 4877 and RFC 5555, that an IPsec implementation needs to be
   modified to afford security services to MIPv6 and DSMIPv6.  This
   document shows that it is possible to implement MIPv6 and DSMIPv6 in
   a way that does not require change to a native or Bump-in-the-stack
   (BITS) IPsec implementation conformant to RFC 4301.

Internet-Draft       (DS)MIPv6 with Unmodified IPsec        October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC3775] specifies a protocol which allows nodes
   to remain reachable while moving to different location of the IPvv6
   Internet.  Each mobile node is identified by a so-called home address
   that is independent from its current point of attachment.  A mobile
   node also has a so-called care-of address at which it is reachable
   and which reflects its current point of attachment.  MIPv6 allows a
   mobile node to register with its home agent and correspondent nodes
   the binding between its IPv6 Home Address and IPv6 Care-of Address so
   that they are able to route appropriately packet they wish to send to
   its Home Address.

   Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6) [RFC5555] specifies extensions to
   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC3775] that allow a Mobile Node (MN) and Home
   Agent (HA) to operate in a Dual Stack manner with support for both
   IPv4 and IPv6:

      The Mobile Node (MN) can register with its Home Agent (HA)
      bindings with IPv4 Home Addresses and Home Prefixes in addition to
      the IPv6 Home Address and Home Prefix.

      The tunnel between the MN and the HA can be over either of IPv4 or
      IPv6.

      The tunnel between the MN and the HA can transport both IPv4 and
      IPv6 packets.

   [RFC3775] specifies that MIPv6 uses IPsec [RFC4301] to secure
   signaling between the MN and the HA.  Additionaly, [RFC3776] and
   [RFC4877] discusses in more depth these requirements , illustrates
   the used packet formats, describes suitable configuration procedures,
   and shows how implementations can process the packets in the right
   order.

   It's been argued in the past and in some documents, such as
   [RFC3776], [RFC4877], and [RFC5555], that an IPsec implementation
   needs to be modified to afford security services to MIPv6 and
   DSMIPv6.  This document shows that it is possible to implement MIPv6
   and DSMIPv6 in a way that does not require change to a native or
   Bump-in-the-stack (BITS) IPsec implementation conformant to
   [RFC4301].  Such an implementation would rely on either of 1) API to
   IPsec to query for the correspondance between a SPD entry and a SPI,
   or 2) heuristics and locking strategies.

3.  Proposed Generic MIPv6/DSMIPv6 Implementation Architecture

   The proposed generic architecture that allows implementing (DS)MIPv6
   without requiring modifications to a native or bump-in-the-stack
   IPsec implementation involves separating the implementation into two
   modules.  A (DS)MIPv6 protocol module sits on top of the IP layer and
   originates and receives (DS)MIPv6 signaling.  Underneath the IP layer
   is a (DS)MIPv6 tunnel interface that is in charge of encapsulation
   and decapsulation of packets, and is interfaced with the (DS)MIPv6
   module.

   The layout of the proposed generic architecture with native and bump-
   in-the-stack IPsec implementations is represented in Figure 1 and
   Figure 2, respectivelly.

   The funtional break-down between the two modules is explained in the
   following two sub-sections.

3.1.  DSMIPv6 protocol module

   The (DS)MIPv6 protocol module is responsible for the following
   functions:

   o  Encapsulation of the packets it is passed by the IP stack.
      Encapsulation and decapsulation of data payload packets is done by
      addition and removal of an IPv6, IPv4, or IPv4 + UDP headers.
      Encapsulation of signaling packets sent natively over IPv6
      involves replacing the IPv6 Home Address present in the the source
      or destination address field with an IPv6 Care-of Address and
      inserting a Home Address option, or inserting an IPv4 header, and
      possibly a UDP header as well when a NAT is detected.

   o  Decapsulation of the packets that it receives from the IP stack.

   o  Processing, Sending and Receiving Signaling Packets

3.2.  DSMIPv6 tunnel interface module

   The (DS)MIPv6 tunnel interface is assigned with the Home Addresses
   available to the Mobile Node: an IPv6 Home Address, and possibly an
   IPv4 Home Address.  The (DS)MIPv6 tunnel interface is responsible for
   the two following functions:

   o  Handling outbound IP packets sourced from the IPv4 or IPv6 Home
      Address for transmission as per the (DS)MIPv6 specifications.

   o  Handling of inbound IP packets received after decapsulation by the
      MIPv6 protocol module.

4.  Discussing Requirements on IPsec Implementations

4.1.  Req. #1: MIPv6 Outbound Processing on the Home Agent

4.1.1.  Requirement

   The specification of the use of IPsec to protect MIPv6 [RFC3776]
   outlines the requirement on changing the destination of IPsec packets
   sent from the agent to the Mobile Node:

      We have chosen to require an encapsulation format for return
      routability and payload packet protection which can only be
      realized if the destination of the IPsec packets sent from the
      home agent can be changed as the mobile node moves.  One of the
      main reasons for choosing such a format is that it removes the
      overhead of twenty four bytes when a home address option or
      routing header is added to the tunneled packet.  Such an overhead
      would not be significant for the protection of the return
      routability packets, but would create an additional overhead if
      IPsec is used to protect the tunneling of payload packets to the
      home agent.  This overhead may be significant for real-time
      traffic.  Given that the use of the shorter packet formats for any
      traffic requires the existence of suitable APIs, we have chosen to
      require support for the shorter packet formats both for payload
      and return routability packets.

      In order to support the care-of address as the destination address
      on the mobile node side, the home agent must act as if the outer
      header destination address in the security association to the
      mobile node would have changed upon movements.  Implementations
      are free to choose any particular method to make this change, such
      as using an API to the IPsec implementation to change the
      parameters of the security association, removing the security
      association and installing a new one, or modification of the
      packet after it has gone through IPsec processing.  The only
      requirement is that after registering a new binding at the home
      agent, the next IPsec packets sent on this security association
      will be addressed to the new care-of address.

4.1.2.  Discussion

   The author found that the modification of the packet after it has
   gone through IPsec processing is a straightforward way of realizing
   the requirement which does not require change to the IPsec
   implementation.  Packets sent to a MN HoA destination can be
   recognized by the tunneling code after IPsec processing and thus the
   destination address can be replaced by the CoA.

4.2.  Req. #2: MIPv6 Tunnel Interface Specific Security Policy Database
      Entries

4.2.1.  Requirement

   The specification of the use of IPsec to protect MIPv6 [RFC3776]
   outline the requirements to have SPD entries that are specific to
   tunnel interface:

      We have chosen to require policy entries that are specific to a
      tunnel interface.  This means that implementations have to regard
      the Home Agent - Mobile Node tunnel as a separate interface on
      which IPsec SPDs can be based.  A further complication of the
      IPsec processing on a tunnel interface is that this requires
      access to the BITS implementation before the packet actually goes
      out.

   This is confirmed by the inclusion of the interface specific SPD
   entries to protect return routability messages:




              mobile node SPD OUT:
                - IF interface = IPv6 tunnel to home_agent_1 &
                     source = home_address_1 & destination = any &
                     proto = MH
                  THEN USE SA SA3

              mobile node SPD IN:
                - IF interface = IPv6 tunnel from home_agent_1 &
                     source = any & destination = home_address_1 &
                     proto = MH
                  THEN USE SA SA4


   As well as payload packets:

                - IF interface = IPv6 tunnel to home_agent_1 &
                     source = home_address_1 & destination = any &
                     proto = X
                  THEN USE SA SA7

              mobile node SPD IN:
                - IF interface = IPv6 tunnel from home_agent_1 &
                     source = any & destination = home_address_1 &
                     proto = X
                  THEN USE SA SA8


4.2.2.  Discussion

   The author found that the use of IPsec to protect MIPv6 [RFC3776] in
   itself does not require policy entries specific to a tunnel
   interface.  The publication of the revised IPsec architecture
   [RFC4301] provides a mean to select traffic based on mobility headers
   type that makes it possible to use host-wide security policy database
   entries rather than interface specific SPD entries.  This is partly
   acknowledge in [RFC4877] where the tunnel interface selector has been
   removed from the SPD entry used to specify protection of Return
   Routability procedure:

   There is no need to select based on the tunnel interface since the
   non-payload MIPv6 packets have been selected already my the other SPD
   entries.  Therefore one can use an host-wide SPD entry that comes
   last in the SPD to select based on the use of the home address as
   source or destination to catch the payload packets:

4.3.  Req. #3: DSMIPv6 Outbound Processing on the Mobile Node

4.3.1.  Requirement

   The DSMIPv6 specification [RFC5555] states that changes to the
   outbound processing of the Mobile Node IPsec implementation might be
   required:

      In order to be able to send the binding update while in an IPv4-
      only network, the mobile node needs to use the new IPv4 care-of
      address in the outer header, which is different from the care-of
      address used in the existing tunnel.  This should be done without
      permanently updating the tunnel within the mobile node's
      implementation in order to allow the mobile node to receive
      packets on the old care-of address until the binding
      acknowledgement is received.  The method used to achieve this
      effect is implementation dependent and is outside the scope of

      this specification.  This implies that the IP forwarding function
      (which selects the interface or tunnel through which a packet is
      sent) is not based solely on the destination address: some IPv6
      packets destined to the home agent are sent via the existing
      tunnel, while BUs are sent using the new care-of address.  Since
      BUs are protected by IPsec, the forwarding function cannot
      necessarily determine the correct treatment from the packet
      headers.  Thus, the DSMIPv6 implementation has to attach
      additional information to BUs, and this information has to be
      preserved after IPsec processing and made available to the
      forwarding function or to DSMIP extensions included in the
      forwarding function.  Depending on the mobile node's
      implementation, meeting this requirement may require changes to
      the IPsec implementation.

4.3.2.  Discussion

   The author found that the DSMIPv6 specification [RFC5555] in itself
   does not require changes to the IPsec implementation compared to that
   of MIPv6 [RFC3775].

   Regarding the outbound MN processing, the ability to send the binding
   update from a new IPv4 care-of address in the outer header different
   from the care-of address used for tunneling payload packets can be
   achieved entirely within the forwarding function of the DSMIPv6
   tunneling code and does not necessarily require attaching additional
   information attached to BUs and this information to be preserved
   after IPsec processing and made available to the forwarding function
   or to DSMIP extensions included in the forwarding functions.

   If the DSMIPv6 tunnel is modeled as a virtual interface, it will
   receive from a BITS IPsec implementation ESP protected BUs and data
   packets.  While it is true that these packets can possibly be
   encrypted and thus their content not being accessible to the DSMIPv6
   tunnel, one should note that the binding updates and payload packets
   are protected with different security associations.  The binding
   updates are protected with a transport mode security association,
   while the payload packets are protected with a tunnel mode security
   association.  These security associations have different SPIs, thus
   the forwarding function can distinguish between ESP protected binding
   updates and payload packets based on SPIs, in spite of the packets
   being possibly encrypted.

   There are various means through which the DSMIPv6 tunneling code can
   determine whether an ESP packet sent from the MN to the HA is a BU or
   a data packet.  Two techniques that do not require attaching and
   preserving meta-data to a packet throughout IPsec processing are
   outlined below:

      DSMIPv6-IPsec API: As outlined in the revised IPsec Architecture
      [RFC4301], "For outbound processing, each SAD entry is pointed to
      by entries in the SPD-S part of the SPD cache", thus the DSMIPv6
      tunneling code can query the IPsec subsystem to obtain the SPI
      used to protect BUs and can distinguish those from data packets.

      Heuristic and locking: The data packets are many and were sent for
      a certain period of time to the old CoA and using the same SPI.
      In contrast, a single BU is sent once in a while and uses a
      different SPI.  Based on this difference in terms of temporal
      sending pattern, the tunneling code can infer which ESP packet
      contains a BU or a BA, and which ESP packet contains a data
      packets.  When the DSMIPv6 implementation is about to send a BU,
      the tunneling code can detect which single packet uses an SPI
      different from the others: this is the BU.

4.4.  Req. #4: DSMIPv6 Inbound Processing on the Home Agent

4.4.1.  Requirement

   The DSMIPv6 specification [RFC5555] states that changes to the
   inbound processing of the Home Agent IPsec implementation might be
   required:

      Upon receiving the binding update message encapsulated in UDP/
      IPv4, the home agent processes it as follows.  In order to allow
      the DSMIPv6 implementation in the home agent to detect the
      presence of a NAT on the path to the mobile node, it needs to
      compare the outer IPv4 source address with the IPv4 address in the
      IPv4 care-of address option.  This implies that the information in
      the outer header will be preserved after IPsec processing and made
      available to the DSMIPv6 implementation in the home agent.
      Depending on the home agent's implementation, meeting this
      requirement may require changes to the IPsec implementation.

4.4.2.  Discussion

   The author found that the DSMIPv6 specification [RFC5555] in itself
   does not require changes to the IPsec implementation compared to that
   of MIPv6 [RFC3775].

   Regarding inbound HA processing, the ability to detect NAT by
   comparing the outer IPv4 source address with the IPv4 address in the
   IPv4 care-of address option does not require the information in the
   outer header to be be preserved throughout IPsec processing.

   When the DSMIPv6 tunnel receives the UDP encapsulated packets,
   although the BUs can possibly be encrypted by ESP and thus their

   content innaccessible to the DSMIPv6 code at this stage, the DSMIPv6
   code has the ability to perform NAT detection nevertheless.  This
   ability relies on the ability to distinguish BU performing NAT
   detection from other messages, to record the source IPv4 address and
   UDP port number used in the encapsulation headers, and to reassociate
   them with the packet after IPsec processing occured.  If the message
   is a BU, the outer IPv4 address can be recorded, the packet passed to
   the IPsec implementation for ESP processing, and when the
   decapsulated BU is passed back to DSMIPv6, the DSMIPv6 code handling
   the BU can compare the IPv4 CoA contained in the packet with the
   outer header IPv4 address that was previously recorded.

   There are various means through which the DSMIPv6 tunneling code can
   determine whether an IPv4-UDP encapsulated ESP packet sent from the
   MN to the HA is a BU performing NAT detection or not.  Two techniques
   that do not require attaching and preserving meta-data to a packet
   throughout IPsec processing are outlined below:

      DSMIPv6-IPsec API: As outlined in the revised IPsec Architecture
      [RFC4301], "For each of the selectors defined in Section 4.4.1.1,
      the entry for an inbound SA in the SAD MUST be initially populated
      with the value or values negotiated at the time the SA was
      created", thus the DSMIPv6 tunneling code can query the IPsec
      subsystem to obtain the traffic selector for the ESP SPI, and
      determine whether the packet is a BU or not.  If it is a BU its
      source IPv4 address and port number can be recorded with the
      binding cache entry for the IPv6 HoA used in the traffic selector
      before the packet is passed to the IPsec BITS.

      Heuristic and locking: NAT detection occurs at initial attach and
      after handover via sending a BU encapsulated in UDP and IPv4.
      Thus, in the case of a NAT detection BU the source IPv4 address in
      the outer IPv4 header will differ from the IPv4 CoA previously
      recorded in the binding cache entry for the MN.  When that is the
      case, it can be determined that the packet is either a NAT
      detection BU or garbage, and its source IPv4 address and port
      number can be recorded before the packet is passed to the IPsec
      BITS.

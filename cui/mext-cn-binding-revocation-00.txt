Internet-Draft          CN Binding Revocation            November 2009 
    

1. Introduction 

   Mobility Support in IPv6 [RFC3775] specifies two possible modes for 
   communications between the Mobile Node (MN) and a Correspondent Node 
   (CN), Bidirectional Tunneling mode and Route Optimization (RO) mode. 

   As specified in [RFC3775], Route Optimization mode "requires the 
   mobile node to register its current binding at the correspondent 
   node." When the mobile node want to transmit a packet, it also need 
   check whether there is a Binding Update List entry for the 
   destination of the packet, as specified in section 11.3.1 of 
   [RFC3775]. If the mobile node confirms that the correspondent node 
   has a suitable Binding Cache entry, the mobile node may send the 
   packet to the correspondent node in route optimization mode. 

   For the mobile node, which mode to be used depends on whether the 
   correspondent node Binding Update List entry exists or not. 

   [mext-binding-revocation] specifies a binding revocation mechanism, 
   which permit HA/LMA to send Binding Revocation Indication to the 
   MN/MAG, to terminate the MN's mobility session and release the 
   associated resources. The binding revocation mechanism specified in 
   [mext-binding-revocation] is only applied for the binding in Home 
   Agent or Local Mobility Anchor, but can not be applied for the 
   binding in correspondent node. 

   In some cases, the correspondent node also needs the capability to 
   revoke the correspondent binding from the mobile node during a route 
   optimized session. 

   This document is used to introduce the mechanism used by 
   correspondent node to terminate the correspondent node binding in the 
   MN's Binding Update List. 

    

2. Terminology 

   All the general mobility related terminology and abbreviations are to 
   be interpreted as defined in Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] and [mext-binding-
   revocation].

   The detailed descriptions are as follows: 

   (a)~(f) Normal Return Routability procedure as specified in  
           [RFC3775]. 

   (g)~(h) Normal Route Optimization binding registration as specified 
           in [RFC3775]. 

   (i) The correspondent node sends the Binding Revocation Indication 
           packet to the mobile node, including the Binding 
           Authorization Data Option in the message.

   (j) The mobile node deletes the correspondent node binding, releases 
           related resource and replies the Binding Revocation 
           Acknowledgement message to the correspondent node. After this 
           step, the Route Optimization mode is released and the 
           Bidirectional Tunneling mode is applied. 

    

    

4. Correspondent Node Operation 

   To terminate the correspondent node binding in the MN's Binding 
   Update List, the correspondent node sends a packet to the mobile node 
   containing a Binding Revocation Indication as specified in section 7 
   of [mext-binding-revocation], with the exception as following: 

   o  The source address of the packet MUST be set as the IP address of 
      the correspondent node, if the correspondent node is a mobile node 
      the home address of the node MUST be taken as the IP address. 

   o  The Binding Authorization Data option, which is specified in 
      section 6.2.7 of [RFC3775], MUST be included in the Binding 
      Revocation Indication packet. Since the communication between the 
      mobile node and the correspondent node is not protected by 
      security association, the sender of the BRI MUST provide the 
      Authorization option. The Binding Management Key specified in 
      [RFC3775], the calculation of the Kbm specified in the section 
      5.2.5 of [RFC3775] and the calculation of the Authenticator 
      specified in the section 6.2.7 of [RFC3775] are reused in this 
      document. 

   o  After the Binding Revocation Indication packet has been sent, the 
      correspondent MUST set a flag in the correspondent Binding Cache 
      entry to indicate the "Revocation Pending" state and stop 
      transmitting any outgoing packets (except retransmitted BRI) 
      destined directly for the mobile node.  

   o  In the "Revocation Pending" state the correspondent node MUST 
      accept incoming route optimized packets until the Binding Cache 
      entry is freed. 

   o  The correspondent node SHOULD maintain the "Revocation Pending" 
      state until Binding Revocation Acknowledgement has been received 
      or the maximum number of retransmissions have been conducted as 
      specified in section 6.3 of [mext-binding-revocation].

Internet-Draft          CN Binding Revocation            November 2009 
    

   o  The correspondent node MAY free all resources associated with this 
      mobile node binding in the cases of receiving the Binding 
      Revocation Acknowledgement or finishing the retransmission 
      procedure. 

   o  If the correspondent node receives packet containing Home Address 
      option after it has freed the Binding Cache entry and related 
      resource, whether to accept the packet or not depends on the 
      implementation of the correspondent node. This is out of the scope 
      of this document. 

    

5. Mobile Node Operation 

   Upon receiving a packet carrying a Binding Revocation Indication, the 
   mobile node MUST validate the packet according to Section 6.2 of 
   [mext-binding-revocation], with the addition of following tests: 

   o  The mobile node MUST verify that the IP address in the Type 2 
      routing header is its Home Address.  If the test fails, the mobile 
      node SHOULD silently discard the received Binding Revocation 
      Indication message. 

   o  The mobile node MUST verify the source address of the received 
      Binding Revocation Indication packet. If the mobile node Binding 
      Update List contains an entry for the IP address, the mobile node 
      MUST check the Binding Authorization Data option contained in this 
      packet.  If the Authenticator is valid and other tests are 
      verified, the mobile node MUST accept this Binding Revocation 
      Indication. Otherwise the mobile node SHOULD silently discard the 
      received Binding Revocation Indication message. The Binding 
      Management Key specified in [RFC3775], the calculation of the Kbm 
      specified in the section 5.2.5 of [RFC3775] and the calculation of 
      the Authenticator specified in the section 6.2.7 of [RFC3775] are 
      reused in this document. 

   o  If the mobile node accepts this Binding Revocation Indication, the 
       mobile node MUST send a successful Binding Revocation 
       Acknowledgement to the correspondent node. Otherwise the mobile 
       node MUST send a rejected Binding Revocation Acknowledgement. 

   o  After the mobile node has accepted the Binding Revocation 
      Indication message, the mobile node MAY free the resources related 
      to the correspondent node Binding Update List entry. The mobile 
      node MUST stop transmitting any outgoing packets destined directly 
      for the correspondent node after acknowledgement has been sent.

Internet-Draft          CN Binding Revocation            November 2009 
    

   o  If the mobile node receives packet containing type 2 routing 
      header after it has freed the correspondent node binding, whether 
      to accept the packet or not depends on the implementation of the 
      mobile node. This is out of the scope of this document. [[ Note: 
      This case is also possible in basic MIP6 network. The mobile node 
      maybe receives packet containing type 2 routing header before the 
      Binding Acknowledgement message, because the BA message and route 
      optimized packets are transported disorderly in the IP network.]]

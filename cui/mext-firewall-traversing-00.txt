Abstract 

   This document presents a new approach for the scenario where the 
   correspondent node is in a network protected by stateful firewall. 
   The approach extends the mobility management procedure and enables 
   the Return Routability related messages to traverse the stateful 
   firewall and Route Optimization may also be achieved well in such 
   scenario.

Internet-Draft       Firewall Traversing for RO          February 2010 
    

1. Introduction 

   Mobile IP [RFC3775] is standardized to support mobility of IPv6 and 
   the Mobile Node with support of Mobile IP can keep the established 
   session when it is moving. 

   Firewall is security device that can protect IP nodes inside the 
   security domain and resist hostile attacks. 

   Mobility and security are the most important features of IPv6 but in 
   current specifications they can not cooperate well. 

   As specified in [RFC4487], many issues will happen in some scenarios. 
   Section 5.2 of [RFC4487] shows the scenario where the correspondent 
   node is in a network protected by firewall. Some analyses for this 
   scenario are also provided in [RFC4487]. 

   In principle, the issues may be resolved in two different ways, 
   extension of firewall or extension of mobility management. 

   One approach, which is based on extensions and configuration of 
   static firewall, is introduced in [draft-ietf-mext-firewall-admin] 
   and [draft-ietf-mext-firewall-vendor]. But at present many network 
   administrators use stateful firewall as the security device and the 
   configuration of static firewall is not welcomed in many scenarios. 

   This document presents another approach, which is based on the 
   combination of extension of Mobility management and stateful 
   firewall. In this approach the requirements of firewall may be 
   simplified and the complex configuration on firewall may be avoided. 

    

2.  Terminology 

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be 
   interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC3775] and 
   Problem Statement of Mobile IPv6 and Firewalls [RFC4487].

3. Scenario and Solution Consideration 

3.1. Scenario 

   This document focuses on the scenario described in section 5.2 of 
   [RFC4487]. In this scenario the Corresponding Node is protected by 
   the firewall.

             Figure 1 CN Is in a Network Protected by Firewall. 

   Since the stateful firewall is the most common firewall device in 
   current network, this draft takes the fact as a precondition. 

   The stateful firewalls implement the Stateful packet filtering 
   function which is defined in [RFC2647] as "forwarding or rejecting 
   traffic based on the contents of a state table maintained by a 
   firewall." [RFC2647] also specifies that "devices using stateful 
   packet filtering will only forward packets if they correspond with 
   state information maintained by the device about each connection". 
   Additionally, the connection is established by data exchanged between 
   hosts. 

   In such scenario, the connection between corresponding node C and 
   external node B is established in the firewall based on the address 
   of corresponding node C and home address of mobile node B. At this 
   stage the corresponding node C may send packets to home address (by 
   existing connection state) and care of address (by dynamically 
   established connection state) of external mobile node B. The external 
   node B can send packets to corresponding node only with its home 
   address but can not send packets to C with its care of address,

   because there is no corresponding connection state for the care of 
   address of node B. 

    

3.2. Solution Consideration 

   This document presents a new approach for the above scenario. The 
   solution extends the route optimization establishment procedure and 
   use 'Hole Punching' techniques to set up a connection state for care 
   of address of external node B. 

   The message flow of this solution is as follows:

   The detailed descriptions are as follows:  

   At the initiatory stage, the stateful firewall establishes a 
   connection state for the internal node (i.e., CN C) and external node 
   (i.e., MN B). CN C can send packets to MN B by home address of MN B, 
   which is included in the destination IP address field of the packet. 
   Since the firewall maintains the connection state, the packets are 
   allowed to go through the firewall. MN B can also send packets to CN 
   C by home address of MN B, which is included in the source IP address 
   field of the packet. Since the firewall maintains the connection 
   state, the packets are also allowed to go through the firewall. 

   (a1~a3) MN B initiates the Return Routability procedure and sends 
   HoTI and CoTI messages to CN C as specified in [RFC3775], with the 
   exception that the Punching Flag and Alternate Care-of Address Option 
   are included in the HoTI message. HoA of MN B is included in the 
   source IP address field of HoTI and CoA of MN B is included in the 
   source IP address field of CoTI message.  

   (b1) Since the firewall maintains the state of HoA connection (i.e., 
   between the address pair of CN and HoA of MN), the HoTI message is 
   allowed to go through the firewall.  But the firewall doesn't 
   maintain the state of CoA connection (i.e., between the address pair 
   of CN and CoA of MN), the CoTI message is not allowed to go through 
   the firewall. The firewall drops the CoTI packet. 

   (c1~c3) CN C receives the HoTI message and replies a HoT message as 
   specified in [RFC3775]. The HoT message can traverse the firewall and 
   arrive at MN B. 

   (d1~d2) The Punching Flag included in HoTI message trigger the CN B 
   to respond a Care-of Test Allowance (CoTA) message to the address 
   which is included in the Alternate Care-of Address Option. CN C 
   copies the care of address from the HoTI message and sends the Care-
   of Test Allowance message to the care of address of MN B. Since the 
   stateful firewall permits the protected node to send packets to the 
   outside network, the CoTA message can traverse the firewall and 
   arrive at MN B. The firewall simultaneously establishes a new 
   connection state for the care of address of MN B in its connection 
   state table. 

   (e1~e2) MN B receives the CoTA message and immediately resends the 
   CoTI message to CN C. Since there is corresponding connection state 
   in the firewall at this time, the CoTI can go through the firewall.

   (f1~f2) The CN C receives the CoTI message and responds CoT as 
   specified in [RFC3775]. The CoT packet goes through the firewall and 
   arrives at MN B. 

   (g1~g4) Normal corresponding binding update is implemented as 
   specified in [RFC3775]. 

   After the Route Optimization is established, packets can be delivered 
   without the involvement of Home Agent.

4.2. Care-of Test Allowance Message 

   A node in the protected network uses the Care-of Test Allowance
   (CoTA) message to punch a hole in the stateful firewall for the 
   Return Routability procedure. The Care-of Test Allowance message 
   uses the MH Type value TBD1.  When this value is indicated in the MH
   Type field, the format of the Message Data field in the Mobility 
   Header is as follows:

   16-bit field reserved for future use.  The value MUST be initialized 
   to zero by the sender, and MUST be ignored by the receiver. 

   Mobility Options 

   Variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility 
   Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  This field contains 
   zero or more TLV-encoded mobility options.  The receiver MUST ignore 
   and skip any options which it does not understand. 

    

5. Security Considerations 

   The security must be carefully considered for this solution. Since 
   the attacker can forge the Home Test Init message and cheat the 
   firewall for a dangerous hole, the protected node must carefully 
   check the HoTI message and some security extensions may be integrated

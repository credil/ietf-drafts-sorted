1. Introduction 

   Sigtran is designed to provide IP based signaling bearer for the 
   existing switched circuit network signaling protocols. Sigtran 
   typically consists of three components: adaptation sub-layer, common 
   signaling transport protocol (i.e., SCTP) and standard IP transport. 
   Sometimes application signaling protocol can be directly combined 
   with SCTP transport protocol. Sigtran enabled application signaling 
   to be transported in the IP network and in some scenarios Sigtran can 
   also compress the original protocol stack. Sigtran provides an 
   important way to migrate the TDM based circuit-switched network to 
   the IP based packet-switched network. 

   But in some aspects the functionality and performance provided by 
   Sigtran can not meet the same criterion as SS7 or TDM based circuit-
   switched network. However, these aspects are crucial in the 
   telecommunication. 

   For example, [ITU-T-Q.704] specifies "in the case of a link failure, 
   the traffic conveyed over the faulty link should be diverted to one 
   or more alternative links" (section 3.1) and [ITU-T-Q.704] also 
   introduces changeover mechanism to "ensure that signaling traffic 
   carried by the unavailable signaling link is diverted to the 
   alternative signaling link(s) as quickly as possible while avoiding 
   message loss, duplication or mis-sequencing" (section 5.1.1). This 
   requirement is very important to telecommunication network but this 
   functionality is not inherited in Sigtran solutions. 

   On the other hand, Sigtran provides a new manner for signaling 
   transport. But in the Sigtran network some SS7 network management 
   functions are affected and the existing Sigtran network management 
   can not meet the requirements of telecommunication network.  

   Some analyses are provided and some problems are also stated in this 
   document. Section 3 is about SCTP association changeover and section 
   4 is about routing management in Sigtran network. Conclusion and 
   recommendation are provided at last. 

2. Terminology 

   All the Sigtran related terms used in this document are to be 
   interpreted as defined in Stream Control Transmission Protocol 
   [RFC4960] and Signaling System 7 (SS7) Message Transfer Part 3 (MTP3) 
   - User Adaptation Layer (M3UA) [RFC4666].

3. SCTP Association Changeover Problem 

3.1. SCTP Message Retrieval Problem 

   In SCTP specification [RFC4960], some primitives are defined to 
   provide SCTP transport service to the ULP. The ULP can use "Receive 
   Unsent Message" and "Receive Unacknowledged Message" primitives to 
   retrieve the data that need retransmission or other disposal. The ULP 
   can get the related information from SCTP layer by "Status" or 
   "COMMUNICATION LOST notification" primitives. But in fact, in most 
   scenarios the ULP can not get the accurate information related to the 
   acknowledged/unacknowledged data. For example, in the flowing 
   scenario: 

         Endpoint A         IP network             Endpoint  B 
     ULP           SCTP       |                   SCTP      ULP

   In such an assumption, endpoint A sends data to endpoint B. At time 
   T1 endpoint A receives the first sack for data #1, at time T2 
   endpoint B receives all data #1, #2 and #3, and responds sack #1, #2 
   and #3. Endpoint A receives sack #2 and #3 respectively at time T3 
   and T4. In this flow the time sequence is T1 < T2 < T3 < T4. 

   If the IP network that connecting endpoint A and endpoint B is 
   interrupted at time T which is between T2 and T3, endpoint B should 
   receive data #1, #2 and #3, but endpoint A should only receive sack 
   for data #1. When the SCTP layer in endpoint A sends COMMUNICATION 
   LOST notification to the ULP layer, SCTP indicates ULP that data #2 
   and #3 are not acknowledged, so if the ULP layer retrieves 
   unacknowledged data and retransmits the data in some other manner, 
   the endpoint B would receives the duplicated data #2 and #3, which is 
   explicitly a wrong result. 

   If the IP network that connecting endpoint A and endpoint B is 
   interrupted at the time between T3 and T4, endpoint B should receive 
   data #1, #2 and #3, but endpoint A should only receive sack for data 
   #1 and data #2. When the SCTP layer in endpoint A sends COMMUNICATION 
   LOST notification to the ULP layer, SCTP indicates ULP that data #3 
   are not acknowledged, so if the ULP layer retrieves unacknowledged 
   data and retransmits the data in some other manner, the endpoint B 
   would receives the duplicated data #3, which is also a wrong result. 

   Analyzing these cases, we can find that the key issue is the floating 
   sack packets. The amount of floating sack packets depends on the 
   throughput, the trip time from the receiver to the sender and other 
   reasons. The amount, which is related to the network condition, may 
   be small, middle or large. Because of these floating sack packets, 
   ULP can't get the accurate unacknowledged information via the 
   existing primitives. 

3.2. SS7 Adapter over SCTP Problem 

   M3UA specified in [RFC4666] is the most popular SS7 adapter in 
   current network. M3UA can provide service not only to IPSP-IPSP 
   communication but also to Signalling Gateway. 

   The failover mechanism in M3UA layer is "n+k" redundancy model, where 
   "n" ASPs are active and "k" ASPs are inactive. When the active ASP(s) 
   lost communication (association interrupted), the inactive ASPs may 
   takeover the active ASP role. But during the failover procedure the 
   traffic is affected. Some signaling messages that have been sent to 
   the interrupted association are not successfully transported to the 
   receiver, so the failover mechanism M3UA provided is a "lossful" 
   solution.

3.3. Application Signalling over SCTP Problem 

   Signalling layer may use the SCTP layer directly without adapter 
   layer, such as S1-MME interface in 3GPP network. In the control plane 
   of 3GPP LTE/EPC network the E-UTRAN accesses EPC network by S1-MME 
   interface, and the protocol stack specified in section 5.1.1.2 of 
   [3GPP-TS-23401] is as below: 

      +-----------+            |            +-----------+ 
      |   S1-AP   |  ---------------------  |   S1-AP   |     
      |-----------|            |            |-----------| 
      |   SCTP    |  ---------------------  |   SCTP    |     
      |-----------|            |            |-----------| 
      |    IP     |  ---------------------  |    IP     |     
      |-----------|            |            |-----------| 
      |    L2     |  ---------------------  |    L2     |     
      |-----------|            |            |-----------| 
      |    L1     |  ---------------------  |    L1     |     
      +-----------+            |            +-----------+ 
          eNodeB             S1-MME              MME 

                     Figure 2 eNodeB/MME Architecture 

   SCTP is adopted as the signaling transport protocol in LTE/EPC 
   network. Section 4.1 of [3GPP-TS-36412] additionally specifies that 
   "Provision of redundancy in the signaling network" is provided by the 
   S1 signaling bearer. But, because SCTP can't support inter-
   association changeover function now, which means SCTP can only 
   provide inner-association level redundancy mechanism but can not 
   provide end-to-end level redundancy mechanism, 3GPP has to specify in 
   section 7 of [3GPP-TS-36412] that "There shall be only one SCTP 
   association established between one MME and eNB pair". In fact, there 
   is no distributed SCTP TCB implement, so in the actual device, any 
   association MUST be implemented in single host or single board. Also 
   because of the high speed data transmission, TCB synchronization and 
   buffered data reproduction are almost can't be achieved in practice. 
   So the "single board/single association" mechanism can't meet the 
   redundancy requirement of telecommunication network. On the other 
   hand, one association can only provide limited throughput for ULP, 
   because of the hardware capability, so the multi-association solution 
   SHOULD be provided for the telecommunication network and the 
   association changeover mechanism SHOULD also be provided. 

4. Routing Management Problem 

   Routing management is a very important functionality in the signaling 
   network. When the source node wants to send a signaling message to 
 
 
Cui, et al.            Expires August 10, 2010                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft    PS for Sigtran Network Management      February 2010 
    

   the destination node, the source node MUST know some address 
   information of the destination node. The destination may be 
   identified by Signalling Point Code, IP address, User identity or 
   other identifiers. The source node encapsulates the signaling message 
   and transmits the message to the network. In SS7 network the 
   destination of the signaling message may be a node (Layer3 node, 
   Layer3 identifier) or a specific part in a specific node (User part 
   of a node, Layer3 identifier + User Identity). The routing of user 
   part falls into the scope of signaling routing management, too. 

   But current Sigtran specifications don't provide complete solution 
   for some scenarios. [I-D.sigtran-m3ua-ext] and 
   [Liaison-sigtran-to-3gpp] have presented some discussion on this 
   topic. 
   
   In the basic scenario where IPSEP communicates with No.7 SP, some
   problems on routing management would appear. For example, 

                                          IPSP 2  
                                +----------------------------+ 
                 +-----+        |                            | 
                 | SG1 |-----\  |                            | 
                /+-----+      \ |                 +-------+  | 
      +-------+/               \| +------------+--| User1 |  | 
      | 7#SP1 |                 --| ASP1, ASP2 |\/|       |  | 
      +-------+\                --| ASP3, ASP4 |/\|       |  | 
                \+-----+       /| +------------+--| User2 |  | 
                 | SG2 |------/ |                 +-------+  | 
                 +-----+        |                            | 
                                +----------------------------+ 
                                   
                 Figure 3 Sigtran Routing Management Issue 

   In this case, SP1 is No.7 Signalling Point, SG1 and SG2 are 
   Signalling Gateways. 7#SP1 may use TDM based or IP based signaling 
   connection to access the SGs. IPSP2 is an IP based No.7 Signalling 
   Point and two User Parts are running in this node. Additionally there 
   are four ASPs connecting to SG1 and SG2 respectively (ASP1 and ASP2 
   to SG1, ASP3 and ASP4 to SG2). ASP1 and ASP3 both provide service to 
   User1 in IPSP2. ASP2 and ASP4 both provide service to User4 in IPSP2.

   User2       ASP2    Association2    SG1        7#SP1 
   
   User2       ASP4    Association4    SG2        7#SP1 

   In this scenario, if Association #1 loses communication to SG1 (too 
   heavy traffic from User1, board crashes down or other reasons) while 
   association #2 is active, SG1 SHOULD detects that IPSP2 is an 
   available node and User1 in IPSP2 is unavailable, SG1 SHOULD send a 
   Destination User Part Unavailable (DUPU) message to 7#SP1 at this 
   moment. However, SG2 and all connections of SG2 work well.

   7#SP1 would meet the confusing situation in this scenario. Because 
   MTP and Sigtran don't maintain status information of remote User Part 
   and MTP/Sigtran would send unavailable indication by MTP-STATUS 
   primitive to User Part. But the other path (7#SP1-SG2-IPSP2 User1) 
   for the User Part is active, so the User part of 7#SP1 can't proceed 
   correctly.  

   In other scenarios where multiple IPSPs or No.7 SPs share same 
   Sigtran connections (e.g. M3UA ASPs and SCTP associations), more 
   routing management issues would happen. The existing management 
   solutions on status of destination (i.e., SP status and User Part 
   status) and Routing Context cannot meet the requirements of some 
   telcom environments.

   The origin of these troubles is that Sigtran splits MTP into multiple 
   units, which are indexed by Routing Context. Traditional SS7 protocol 
   stack consists of User Part and Message Transfer Part, so SP status 
   and User Part status is simple. While Sigtran divides Message 
   Transfer Part, which leads to the SP status and User Part status 
   depend on the status of the sub-units and the combination. Existing 
   mechanism can't deal the "partly-available" status.

5. Conclusion and Recommendations 

   The problems about changeover (traffic management) and routing 
   management are introduced in this document. The existing model of     
   application signaling plus Sigtran can not meet the requirements of 
   telecommunication network. So for the IP migration of 
   telecommunication, Sigtran needs some extensions and enhancements.      
       

6. Security Considerations 

   Security considerations regarding traffic management and routing 
   management are needed. The security solution SHOULD fulfill the 
   requirements of all involved nodes and the signaling traffic. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document doesn't request any assignment from IANA.

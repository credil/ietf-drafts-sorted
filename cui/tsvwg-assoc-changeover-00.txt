Abstract 

   Sigtran specifies association-level reliable transport for signaling 
   using SCTP, but in some scenarios a single association failure's 
   reliability mechanism is not sufficient to achieve telco reliability. 
   This document specifies procedures for an SCTP association changeover 
   solution which will enable applications to meet a higher degree of 
   availability. Two generic changeover solutions are presented in this 
   document. One is implemented inside the SCTP protocol stack and the 
   other requires SCTP and ULP to work in collaboration.

Internet-Draft    Association Changeover Framework       February 2010 
    

1. Introduction and Problem Statement 

   Sigtran is designed for the transport of signaling in IP based 
   network. The goal of Sigtran is to provide reliable transport service 
   to application signaling. Most applications expect Sigtran to provide 
   a non-duplication and lossless bearer transport. Applications built 
   on top of Sigtran do not usually take any additional reliablility 
   mechanism in and of themselves. But in fact, a single SCTP 
   association cannot meet crucial requirement of some telcom 
   environments. As stated in section 3.1 and 3.3 of [I-D.sigtran-
   network-management-ps], a single SCTP association cannot meet the 
   requirements of current telecommunication networks. If an application 
   uses multiple SCTP associations to compensate for this deficiency, 
   the lack of inter-association changeover messages will lead to some 
   explicit issues. 

   For example, in the following scenario: 

      +-------+--------+                     +--------+-------+ 
      |       | Assoc1 |---------------------| Assoc1 |       |     
      |       |--------|                     |--------|       | 
      |  eNB  | Assoc2 |---------------------| Assoc2 |  MME  | 
      | S1-AP |--------|                     |--------| S1-AP | 
      |       | . . .  |---------------------| . . .  |       | 
      +-------+--------+                     +--------+-------+ 
     

                 Figure 1 S1-AP over SCTP Changeover Issue 

   In this example, S1-AP is applied in the S1-MME interface for E-UTRAN 
   to access the EPC network and SCTP provides the signaling bearer for 
   S1-AP. If we establish multiple associations (Assoc1 and Assoc2) and 
   when one of them is interrupted, we would meet some troubles. 

   When Assoc1 is interrupted, S1-AP (working as the ULP) may retrieve 
   the unsent and unacknowledged signaling messages and retransmit these 
   messages to MME over the other association. But as stated in section 
   3.1 of [I-D.sigtran-network-management-ps], existing mechanisms can 
   not answer this situation.  

   A detailed example is the eNodeB initiated E-RAB release procedure, 
   which is specified in section 8.2.3.2.2 of [3GPP-TS-36413]. The 
   elements of UE ID and E-RAB ID are included in the message. The 
   message flow is as follows:

           eNB                                          MME 
    
    +----------------+                          +----------------+ 
    |     S1-AP      | E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION |      S1-AP     | 
    |----------------|                          |----------------| 
    |     SCTP       |------------------------->|       SCTP     | 
    +----------------+                          +----------------+ 
    

              Figure 2 eNB Initiated E-RAB Release Indication 

   If eNB resends all the retrieved messages to MME, MME may receive 
   duplicate signaling messages. These duplicated messages go beyond the 
   tolerance of MME.  

   Considering that the association is interrupted after the S1-AP E-RAB 
   RELEASE INDICATION message arrives at MME, the eNB doesn't receive 
   the corresponding SACK packet. A few seconds later, the eNB would 
   detect the association is lost and resend the unacknowledged messages 
   when the interrupted association is reestablished or over the other 
   association. But from the standpoint of the MME, after receiving the 
   first S1-AP E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message the MME would release 
   the corresponding E-RAB and maybe later allocate the E-RAB for a new 
   session for the same UE. If the MME receives the second E-RAB RELEASE 
   INDICATION message (i.e., the duplicated one), the MME would wrongly 
   release the bearer, which is used by the new session. Because bearer 
   resource is only identified by UE ID and E-RAB ID, the MME can not 
   distinguish the two messages. 

   If the eNB doesn't resend the retrieved messages to the MME, some 
   messages would be lost. Considering that the association is 
   interrupted before the S1 E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message arrives at 
   MME, the MME would not receive this message and the bearer resource 
   would not be released as needed. 

   We can find that all signaling transactions without handshake are 
   affected by this problem and other signaling transactions with 
   handshake may meet similar troubles. For example,

                Figure 3 Transaction Acknowledgement Issue 

   In this case, ULP of endpoint B receives the ULP Request message and 
   responds ULP Response message. But in the IP layer, endpoint A maybe 
   receives the DATA chunk containing ULP Response but doesn't receive 
   the SACK chunk for the ULP Request chunk. (There is no sequence 
   guarantee in the IP layer.) The transaction of ULP is accomplished 
   successfully but SCTP still sees the Request message as 
   unacknowledged. If endpoint A resends the ULP Request in SCTP layer, 
   the confusion would happen in the peer endpoint because of the 
   duplicated Request message. If the ULP of endpoint A retrieves the 
   unacknowledged messages from SCTP, the SCTP layer will provide this 
   unacknowledged message, which is in fact transmitted successfully. 
   The ULP also can not recognize this Request message from the finished 
   transaction. 

   So, the existing sigtran solutions cannot meet the network 
   requirements and the SCTP association changeover mechanism SHOULD be 
   provided. 

2. Terminology 

   All the Sigtran related terms used in this document are to be 
   interpreted as defined in Stream Control Transmission Protocol 
   [RFC4960].  

   This document also provides the following context-specific 
   explanation to the following terms used in this document. These terms 
   are defined in 3GPP specifications. 

   eNodeB (eNB)

   The eNodeB is the radio station of 3GPP's future LTE wireless 
   communication standard. 

   Evolved Packet Core (EPC) 

   EPC is the core network architecture of 3GPP's future LTE wireless 
   communication standard. 

   E-RAB 

   An E-RAB uniquely identifies the concatenation of an S1 Bearer and 
   the corresponding Data Radio Bearer. 

   E-UTRAN 

   E-UTRAN is the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network in 
   3GPP standard. 

   Mobility Management Entity (MME) 

   MME is the key control plane entity within Evolved Packet Core. MME 
   functions include Non-Access-Stratum signaling, mobility management, 
   Bearer management, etc. 

   S1 

   Interface between an eNB and an EPC, providing an interconnection 
   point between the E-UTRAN and the EPC. 

   S1-MME 

   The S1-MME is a reference point for the control plane protocol 
   between E-UTRAN and MME in 3GPP standard. 

3. SCTP Association Failure Analysis 

   Many reasons can induce failure of SCTP associations and this 
   document is expected to provide robust association changeover 
   solutions for most association failures, to avoid message loss and 
   duplication. 

3.1. Communication Loss 

   Communication loss can be detected by SCTP endpoints. The failure 
   detection mechanism can use Data and Heartbeat chunks to achieve this 
   function. The reason for communication loss may be IP network trouble 
   or endpoint issues. Since SCTP uses multihoming, IP network trouble 
 
 
Cui, et al.            Expires August 10, 2010                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft    Association Changeover Framework       February 2010 
    

   is usually the common bar for all associations. Association 
   changeover can only overcome some communication loss cases. 

3.2. Endpoint Terminates Association 

   Sometimes an endpoint terminates the association by graceful (i.e., 
   shutdown) or ungraceful (i.e., abort) manner. The ungraceful 
   termination could bring message loss. 

   The following issues may lead to ungraceful association termination. 

   o The endpoint host is out of resource. When the endpoint host runs 
      into overloading status, it may send ABORT chunk to the peer 
      endpoint to terminate this association and offload the traffic. 

   o There is a protocol violation i.e., a disturbing packet. When the 
      endpoint receives a disturbing packet, such as a DATA chunk 
      without user data or a SACK acknowledging an invalid TSN, it will 
      send an ABORT chunk to the peer endpoint. 

   o Some maintenance mistakes happen. For example, if the administrator 
      reconfigures and restarts the association with new addresses when 
      the association is in ESTABLISHED state, the peer endpoint would 
      send an ABORT chunk to abort the association. 

   o User initiates abort in one endpoint. When SCTP layer gets this 
      indication it will send an ABORT chunk to the peer endpoint. The 
      terminating endpoint may have prepared for the ungraceful 
      termination but the peer endpoint does not, the peer endpoint 
      needs some repair mechanism. 

4. Applicability Consideration for Association Changeover 

   This section is intended to present some consideration on the 
   applicability of association changeover mechanism. Association 
   changeover mechanism is expected to enhance the reliability of 
   signaling transport even in some extreme situations, and further to 
   improve the performance of signaling network. However, SCTP 
   association changeover runs in the SCTP layer or upper layers, so it 
   hardly conquers the troubles of IP layer. SCTP association changeover 
   is designed for the unexpected troubles of SCTP layer, which are 
   introduced in the development practice. 

   For example, in the basic scenario where "M3UA+SCTP" protocol stack 
   is used, many ASP sites may connect to the SGP site by multiple SCTP 
   associations, and "n+k" model is applied in M3UA layer. The network 
   architecture is as follows:

                    Figure 4 Association Overload Issue 

   In existing devices, associations are usually implemented in 
   distributed board/host. For example, in site A, association A1 is in 
   board/host A1, association A2 is in board/host A2, etc.. In site B, 
   association B1 is in board/host B1, association B2 is in board/host 
   B2, and so on. Furthermore, association x of site A is also in 
   board/host A1. (This is a very usual case, where multiple 
   associations are provided in one board/host). From the standpoint of 
   site A, site B and site C may be connected in different board/host 
   sets, because it is very unreasonable that requiring same board/host 
   and association amount configured for different peer sites. 

   In the setup stage, M3UA of Site B uses association B1~Bn (i.e., the 
   active ASPs) in load balancing, and M3UA of site A also takes those.  
   Note the association set is selected by site B since site B is in ASP 
   role and sends ASP UP / ASP ACTIVE messages. And Site C also connects 
   to Site A as Site B does. 

   Board B1~Bn of Site B are balanced at this time but unfortunately 
   that is not true in site A, because there are more traffic in 
   board/host A1 (from and to Site C). So board/host A1 may be 
   overloaded. This result is because two intercrossed sets lead to a 
   non-balanced situation, although each set is balanced. (For example, 
   in site A, board #1, #2, #3 and #4 are for Site B, while board #1, 
   #5, #6 and #7 are for Site C, board #1 may be overloaded.) 

   In this situation (i.e., board/host A1 is overloaded), association A1 
   SHOULD send an "Out of Resource" indication to the peer node to 
   offload part traffic from board/host A1. 


 
 
Cui, et al.            Expires August 10, 2010                [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft    Association Changeover Framework       February 2010 
    

   If we use rwnd==0 indication (no receiving buffer resource), the 
   association of #1 is still established, the corresponding M3UA ASP is 
   still active, and the traffic of user part is still partly delivered 
   to the association in both sites of A and B. The endpoints will 
   buffer the messages more and more (at least in B to A direction), 
   until message buffer overflow or association termination. This is not 
   the desired result. 

   If we use Abort indication (Out of Resource, which means no resource 
   of CPU, memory or others), the association of #1 between site A and 
   site B is terminated immediately and the corresponding M3UA ASP 
   becomes inactive too. Then M3UA layer would activate ASP k (e.g. the 
   association which is board/host #8), which is standby, to active 
   status. So the active bearer role is transferred from #1 to #k, and 
   the traffic is transferred in the same time. As a result, the load of 
   board/host A1 is decreased while association #x to site C is still 
   active. This provides a dynamic and robust load balancing mechanism 
   for site A.  

5. Generic Requirements for SCTP Association Changeover 

   As analyzed in [I-D.sigtran-network-management-ps], the essential 
   requirement is that the endpoint pair can exchange the accurate 
   transmission information, so each endpoint can know which messages 
   are really not received by the peer endpoint and later the 
   unacknowledged messages can be retransmitted to the peer endpoint. 

   Two modes of association changeover are considered in this document. 
   The first mode is ULP-Organizing mode, the requirements of this mode 
   include following: 

   o The ULP can retrieve the exactly unsent and unacknowledged messages 
      in sequence. 

   o The ULP/SCTP can find out the alternative association(s) to 
      retransmit the unsent and unacknowledged messages. 

   o If more than one alternative associations are available for 
      retransmission, only one association can be selected for the 
      messages requiring sequence delivery. 

   o For the messages that don't require sequence delivery, all the 
      available alternative association(s) may be used and load 
      balancing may be considered. 

   The second mode is SCTP-Organizing mode, the requirements of this 
   mode include following:

   o The ULP need not to retrieve the messages that have been 
      transferred to SCTP layer. The ULP may take SCTP layer as an 
      entirely reliable transport. 

   o The SCTP layer can find out the alternative association(s) to 
      retransmit the unsent and unacknowledged messages. 

   o The SCTP layer can exchange the acknowledgement information with 
      the peer endpoint, retrieve the unsent and acknowledged messages 
      from the interrupted association and resend these messages in the 
      alternative association(s). 

   o If more than one alternative associations are available for 
      retransmission, only one association can be selected for the 
      messages requiring sequence delivery. 

   o For the messages that don't require sequence delivery, all the 
      available alternative association(s) may be used and load 
      balancing may be considered. 

   The ULP and SCTP layer of the endpoint can negotiate the expected 
   association changeover mode by existing primitives and the endpoint 
   can also negotiate that with the peer endpoint during the association 
   initiation. 

   An issue in SCTP-Organizing mode needs more consideration. During the 
   SCTP layer is implementing the association changeover, the unsent and 
   unacknowledged messages (earlier generated by ULP) are retransmitted 
   in the alternative association(s), but the interrupted association is 
   reestablished and the ULP begin to transmit new messages in the 
   association. So there is such a possibility that the ULP messages 
   which are transported in the reestablished association arrive at the 
   peer endpoint earlier than the ULP messages which are transported in 
   the alternative association(s). This mis-sequence delivery problem 
   may be avoided if the ULP doesn't begin to transmit ULP messages 
   until the association has already completed a period of transport 
   test. The details of this case are for further study. 

6. New Chunks and Options 

6.1. Exchange TSN Notify (ETN) Chunk 

   The Exchange TSN Notify chunk is used for the following purposes: 

   To notify the sender's data acknowledgement information.

   To request retransmission of the unsent and unacknowledged messages 
   in the SCTP-Organizing mode. The receiver of ETN SHOULD retransmit 
   the unsent and unacknowledged messages in the SCTP-Organizing mode. 

   To indicate the available alternative association(s) in the SCTP-
   Organizing mode. The receiver of ETN SHOULD retransmit the unsent and 
   unacknowledged messages in the association(s) from which the Exchange 
   TSN Notify chunk is received.

      Set to TBD1 (allocated by IANA). The highest-order 2 bits of TBD1 
      SHOULD be '11'. When the receiver receives this chunk but does not 
      support it, the receiver SHOULD skip this chunk and continue 
      processing, but report in an ERROR chunk using the 'Unrecognized 
      Chunk Type' cause of error.

      Reserved: 7 bits 

      Should be set to all '0's and ignored by the receiver. 

      R bit: 1 bit 

      The (R)etransmission bit, if set to '1', indicates that the SCTP 
      layer of the receiver is requested to retransmit the unsent and

      association.  

      The value of '0' is used for ULP-Organizing mode and the value of 
      '1' is used for SCTP-Organizing mode. 

   Chunk Length (Mandatory): 16 bits (unsigned integer) 

      This field indicates the length of the Exchange TSN Notify chunk 
      in bytes from the beginning of the type field to the end of the 
      chunk.  In IPv4 network environment, an Exchange TSN Notify chunk 
      without Gap Ack Blocks will have Length set to 36 and an Exchange 
      TSN Notify chunk with N Gap Ack Blocks will have Length set to 36 
      + N*4. In IPv6 network environment, an Exchange TSN Notify chunk 
      without Gap Ack Blocks will have Length set to 60 and an Exchange 
      TSN Notify chunk with N Gap Ack Blocks will have Length set to 60 
      + N*4. 

   Address Type (Mandatory): 16 bits (unsigned integer) 

      Set to 5 if the IP address is IPv4 address or set to 6 if the IP 
      address is IPv6 address.

      needs changeover. 

   Destination Port Number (Mandatory): 16 bits (unsigned integer) 

      Set to the destination port number of the interrupted association 
      which needs changeover. 

   Corresponding Verification Tag (Mandatory): 32 bits (unsigned 
   integer) 

      Set to the Verification Tag of the interrupted association, which 
      is specified in [RFC4960]. 

   The format and meaning of the Cumulative TSN Ack (Mandatory), Number 
   of Gap Ack Blocks (Mandatory) and Gap Ack Block parameters 
   (Conditional) are the same as for the Selective Acknowledgement chunk 
   defined in section 3.3.4 of [RFC4960]. The exception is that some 
   TSNs that were previously acknowledged via SACK Gap Ack Block MAY be 
   reneged by the sender of ETN. (See Section 8 for information on 
   reneging.) 

   Note that both endpoints of the interrupted association may send 
   Exchange TSN Notify chunk and may send the packet in different 
   alternative association(s). The retransmission of the unacknowledged 
   messages in different direction may be retransmitted in different 
   association(s). 

6.2. Exchange TSN Acknowledgement (ETA) Chunk 

   The Exchange TSN Acknowledgement chunk is used for the following 
   purposes: 

   To acknowledge the corresponding Exchange TSN Notify chunk.  

   To notify the ETA sender's data acknowledgement information. 

   To request the retransmission of the unsent and unacknowledged 
   messages in SCTP-Organizing mode. The receiver of ETA SHOULD 
   retransmit the unsent and unacknowledged messages in the SCTP-
   Organizing mode.

   Status (Mandatory): 7 bits (unsigned integer) 

      A 7-bit unsigned integer indicating the disposition of the TSN 
      exchange and association changeover. 

      Values of the Status field less than 64 indicate that the 
      corresponding Exchange TSN Notify was accepted by the sender. 
      Values greater than or equal to 64 indicate that the corresponding 
      Exchange TSN Notify was rejected by the sender. 

      0000000: Exchange TSN Notify chunk is received.

      Other values: Reserved. 

   R bit (Mandatory): 1 bit (unsigned integer) 

      The (R)etransmission bit, if set to '1', indicates that the SCTP 
      layer of the receiver is requested to retransmit the unsent and 
      unacknowledged messages which are belong to the interrupted 
      association. The sender of ETA SHOULD set 'R' bit to '1' only when 
      the value of Status field of the ETA chunk is 0000001 (in current 
      version), that means the endpoint can request the peer's SCTP 
      layer retransmission by ETA only when it accepts the peer's ETN 
      and provides the data acknowledgement information of itself.

   (section 6.1). The exceptions include:

   Cumulative TSN Ack, Number of Gap Ack Blocks and Gap Ack Block 
   parameters are Conditional parameters. These parameters can be

7. Configuration Variables 

   Changeover Timer 

   The SCTP layer SHOULD start this timer after the association is 
   terminated unexpectedly or ungracefully. During this timer is 
   running, the SCTP layer SHOULD keep all the parameters about the
   terminated association and all the unsent and unacknowledged 
   messages. 

   The default value of Changeover Timer is 10 seconds. 

8. Deployment Scenarios and Solution Approach 

   In this deployment scenario, more than one associations are 
   established between the endpoint pair and the SCTP layer is supposed 
   to be able to provide local management function (e.g. alternative 
   association selection).

           Figure 5 SCTP TSN Exchange and Association Changeover 

   The basic purpose of ETN/ETA chunk exchange is restoring the accurate 
   data transmission information, so the SCTP layer can update the 
   status and provide the right unacknowledged messages to ULP in ULP-
   Organizing mode or resend the messages in SCTP-Organizing mode. 

   In SCTP-Organizing mode, the ETN/ETA can additionally request the 
   peer endpoint to retransmit the unsent and unacknowledged messages. 
   In this case, the SCTP layer may transfer all unsent and 
   unacknowledged messages from the interrupted association to the 
   alternative association(s) and resend these messages after receiving 
   the retransmission request in ETN/ETA chunk. The principle of 
   alternative association selection is specified in section 9.4. 

8.1. Association Changeover Initiation 

   When SCTP layer detects association interruption, SCTP layer sends 
   notification to ULP as specified in [RFC4960]. If the association is 
   terminated unexpectedly or ungracefully, and there is not any cached 
   ETN for the association, the SCTP layer SHOULD simultaneously 
   implement the following operations: 

   o  SCTP layer starts the Changeover Timer and caches the data 
      transmission information of the interrupted association (e.g. Last

      unacknowledged messages are retrieved/retransmitted or the 
      Changeover procedure is finished. 

   o  SCTP layer releases all the messages buffered in the Receiving 
      Queue and Reasm Queue and reneges them as unacknowledged. 

   o  SCTP layer chooses alternative association(s) for the interrupted 
      association as specified in section 9.4. 

   o  SCTP layer broadcasts Exchange TSN Notify chunk to the peer 
      endpoint in the selected alternative association(s). The IP 
      address, port number and Corresponding Verification Tag of the 
      interrupted association MUST be included in the Exchange TSN 
      Notify message to identify the corresponding association. The 
      cumulative acknowledged TSN and gap acknowledged TSN block are 
      included in the message to indicate which DATA chunks have been 
      successfully received by the message sender. In ULP-Organizing 
      mode the Chunk Flags of ETN SHOULD be set to 00000000 (i.e., 'R' 
      bit is set to '0'), and in SCTP-Organizing mode the Chunk Flags of 
      ETN SHOULD be set to 00000001 (i.e., 'R' bit is set to '1'). 

   o  The ETN chunk is control chunk but a separate T3-rtx SHOULD be 
      applied. The applied T3-rtx timer is stopped when the 
      corresponding ETA or ERROR chunk is received. 

   o  When SCTP layer receives the corresponding ETA or ERROR chunk it 
      MUST stop the running Changeover Timer.  

   o  All the buffered parameters and messages for the interrupted 
      association MUST be released when the Changeover procedure is 
      finished. 

8.2. ETN Processing 

   When SCTP layer receives Exchange TSN Notify message and the endpoint 
   supports the SCTP Exchange/Changeover function, SCTP layer SHOULD 
   implement the following operations: 

   o  SCTP layer swaps the Primary Source IP Address and the Primary 
      Destination Address included in the received ETN chunk. 

   o  SCTP layer swaps the Source Port Number and Destination Port 
      Number included in the received ETN chunk. 

   o  SCTP layer checks whether the Primary Source IP Address, Primary 
      Destination Address, Source Port Number and Destination Port 
      Number identify an existing association and whether the

Internet-Draft    Association Changeover Framework       February 2010 
    

      Verification Tag matches. If there is no corresponding 
      association, the SCTP layer MUST respond a reject ETN and finish 
      the changeover procedure. 

   o  SCTP layer chooses alternative association(s) for the interrupted 
      association as specified in section 9.4. Only the association(s) 
      that can meet both remote endpoint (the associations carrying ETN 
      chunk) and local endpoint can be selected as the alternative 
      association(s). 

   o  SCTP layer caches the ETN chunk and checks the status of the 
      corresponding association. 

       o  If the corresponding association is in ESTABLISHED status, the 
         SCTP layer responds ETA chunk with Status value 0000000 for 
         each received ETN chunk. No Cumulative TSN Ack, Number of Gap 
         Ack Blocks and Gap Ack Block parameters are included in the ETA 
         chunk. The 'R' bit of ETA MUST be set to '0' in this case. 

       o  If the corresponding association has been recognized as 
         interrupted, the SCTP layer SHOULD respond ETA chunk with 
         Status value 0000001, and additionally set 'R' bit of the ETA 
         chunk to '1' in SCTP-Organizing mode, for each received ETN 
         chunk. Cumulative TSN Ack, Number of Gap Ack Blocks and Gap Ack 
         Block parameters (if there are Gap Ack Blocks) SHOULD be 
         included in the ETA chunk in this case. The receiver of ETN 
         SHOULD release the acknowledged messages (both cumulative 
         acknowledged and gap acknowledged) in the unacknowledged 
         message buffer queue. The receiver of ETN SHOULD immediately 
         retransmit the unsent and unacknowledged messages when the 'R' 
         bit of the received ETN chunk is set to '1'. 

8.3. ETA Processing 

   When SCTP layer receives Exchange TSN Acknowledgement message and the 
   endpoint supports the SCTP Exchange/Changeover function, SCTP layer 
   SHOULD implement the following operations: 

   o  SCTP layer checks whether there is corresponding ETN chunk. If 
      yes, the SCTP layer MUST release the buffered ETN chunk and stop 
      the Changeover Timer. Note the unsent and unacknowledged messages 
      that are buffered for the changeover is not released at this time. 

   o  If the Status value of received ETA is 0000001, the received ETA 
      SHOULD be buffered.

Internet-Draft    Association Changeover Framework       February 2010 
    

   o  If the 'R' bit of the received ETA is set to '1', the receiver of 
      ETA SHOULD immediately update the unacknowledged message queue of 
      the interrupted association and retransmit the unsent and 
      unacknowledged messages. 

   o  SCTP layer MUST NOT respond any chunk for the received ETA chunk. 

8.4. Error Processing 

   When the SCTP layer receives ERROR chunk whose Cause Code equal to 6 
   and the included Unrecognized Chunk is ETN, the SCTP layer SHOULD 
   immediately finish the changeover procedure and release all related 
   resource. 

8.5. Association Failure with Cached ETN 

   When SCTP layer detects association failure and a corresponding ETN 
   chunk has been cached, the SCTP layer SHOULD continue the changeover 
   operations as the ETN chunk is just received (e.g. responding ETA 
   chunk, releasing acknowledged messages and retransmitting the unsent 
   and unacknowledged messages in SCTP-Organizing mode). Note in this 
   case the Status of ETA SHOULD be set to 0000001 and the 
   acknowledgement information SHOULD be included in ETA. 

    

9. Solution Guideline 

9.1. ULP-Organizing Changeover 

   ULP-Organizing mode is an assuasive changeover solution. The ULP MAY 
   negotiate with SCTP layer for this mode or even take the basic 
   implementation specified in [RFC4960] and other specifications. The 
   ULP SHOULD utilize the retrieve primitives and manage the retrieved 
   messages. When one association is interrupted, the ULP SHOULD 
   retrieve the unsent and unacknowledged messages as normal 
   specifications. The SCTP layer would provide the exactly unsent and 
   unacknowledged messages to ULP. The only difference for ULP is that 
   there is a little delay during the retrieve procedure. The delay time 
   is about one RTT of the alternative association. 

9.2. SCTP-Organizing Changeover 

   SCTP-Organizing mode is an intense changeover solution. The endpoint 
   SHOULD negotiate not only between local inner layers but also with 
   the peer endpoint for this mode. When one association is terminated, 
   the SCTP layer can exchange the acknowledgement information with the

Internet-Draft    Association Changeover Framework       February 2010 
    

   peer endpoint, retrieve the unsent and acknowledged messages from the 
   interrupted association and resend these messages in the alternative 
   association(s). Local management functionality of SCTP layer is 
   needed in this mode. The ULP need not care about the messages have 
   been transferred to SCTP layer but SHOULD consider the relative pace 
   between ULP and the SCTP layer. 

9.3. Negotiation for Association Changeover 

   TBD. 

    

9.4. Alternative Association Selection 

   When an abnormal association failure is detected, the available 
   alternative association(s) may be searched for changeover purpose. 
   The alternative association(s) MUST meet the following principle: 

   1, The alternative association(s) MUST connect the same endpoint pair 
      as the interrupted association. The source IP address and 
      destination IP address of the associations MUST be matched. 

   2, The alternative association(s) MUST provide service to the same 
      ULP process as the interrupted association. Note the endpoint can 
      only check locally that the alternative association(s) and 
      interrupted association provide service to same ULP process.  

   3, The initiator of changeover broadcasts ETN chunk in all of its 
      candidate association(s), which means all the association(s) 
      delivering ETN are available for the initiator endpoint. 

   4, The receiver of ETN selects alternative association(s) as bullet 1 
      and 2 of this section among the associations which the ETN chunk 
      is delivered in, and additionally respond ETA in the final 
      alternative association(s). 

   5, The exchange of ETN/ETA can find out the right alternative 
      association(s) for both endpoints. Each endpoint can only use the 
      association(s) that delivering both ETN and ETA chunk as the 
      alternative association(s). 

   6, For the messages requiring sequence delivery only one alternative 
      association can be selected and for other messages all alternative 
      association(s) may be used.

9.5. Comparison with RFC4960 

   This document specifies some enhancement for basic SCTP 
   specification. The extensions consist of following: 

   The status and buffered outbound messages (in outbound transmission 
   queue and retransmission queue) of an abnormal interrupted 
   association SHOULD be kept for certain duration.  

   The buffered inbound messages (in inbound receiving queue and 
   reassembly queue) of an abnormal interrupted association SHOULD be 
   released (same to [RFC4960]) and explicitly reneged. 

   The SCTP layer SHOULD be able to run a timer for the changeover 
   procedure. 

   The SCTP layer SHOULD be able to exchange the accurate data 
   acknowledgement status by ETN/ETA chunks in changeover procedure. 

   The SCTP layer SHOULD be able to select the alternative 
   association(s) in changeover procedure. 

   In ULP-Organizing mode, when the SCTP layer receives retrieve 
   primitives while the ETN is not acknowledged, the SCTP layer SHOULD 
   be able to hold the retrieve request and respond after the ETA chunk 
   is received. 

   In SCTP-Organizing mode, the SCTP layer SHOULD be able to retrieve 
   the unsent and unacknowledged messages from the interrupted 
   association and resend these messages in the alternative 
   association(s). 

    

10. Security Considerations 

   Security considerations regarding changeover are needed. The security 
   solution SHOULD fulfill the requirements of all involved nodes and 
   the signaling traffic. 

11. IANA Considerations 

   TBD1 and TBD2 are new SCTP chunk type. IANA is requested to assign 
   the new type values for these two types of SCTP chunk.

1. Introduction

   IETF community defined MIP6 protocol to provide Mobility Support in
   IPv6 and later HMIP was defined to support Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
   Mobility Management.
   
   In MIP6 protocol [RFC-3775], Mobile Node (MN) may move within the
   network. When the MN moves it sends binding update (BU) message to
   its home agent (HA) or correspondent node (CN) to maintain 
   reachability and ongoing connections between MN and CNs. MIP6
   provides the global mobility solution.
   
   In HMIP protocol [RFC-5380], MN sends binding update message to its
   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) when the MN moves and MAP sends binding
   updates to MN's HA on behalf of the mobile node. HMIP provides the
   localized and hierarchical mobility solution. 

   HMIP mechanism allows MN to hide the location and can reduce packet
   loss when MN is moving by reducing the binding update delay. The
   advantages of HMIP solution can help improving the security and
   performance in mobile network.
   
   [RFC-5380] also permits that a mobile node may send a BU containing
   its LCoA (instead of its RCoA) to correspondent nodes. The purpose
   of this operation is for route optimization. If these nodes are
   connected to the same link, packets will then be routed directly,
   without going through the MAP.

   In fact the multiple binding mechanism may provide an additional
   path if the mobile node sends a BU containing its LCoA as the CoA
   to the home agent. The operation MAY be used for MAP reliability.
   If the MAP gets out of service, packets destined to the MN will
   be routed by HA directly to MN without involving the failed MAP.

   This document specifies the adapted multiple binding mechanism to
   support co-operation on both MIP and HMIP, as a MAP reliability
   solution.

2. Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC-3775]
   and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) Mobility Management
   specification [RFC-5380].

Internet-Draft          MAP Reliability Extension              June 2009

3. Problem statement and analysis

   We may notice that in HMIP network MAP is a mandatory hop in the
   connections between MN and HA or between MN and CNs. If MAP gets
   out of service the MN would lose connections with HA and CNs, so
   the reliability of MAP must be considered seriously.
   
   Some solutions on Home Agent Reliability have been mentioned in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hareliability]. But we must notice the difference
   between HA and MAP. HA is a high-level router, acting as the core
   node for the global mobility, while MAP is in low level, acting as
   an anchor just for a local scope. The number of MAP may be very large
   so we have to think over the cost of MAP equipment. The protocol
   stack and software in MAP should be simple. The operation and
   maintenance should be easy to handle. In these views the solutions
   for HA are not really fit for MAP. Reliability solution for MAP
   should be economical and simple.

4. Proposed Solutions

4.1 Proposed solution overview

   In order to provide a solution for MAP reliability, an adapted
   multiple binding mechanism is introduced in the document. Since the
   global mobility (MIP6) and localized mobility (PMIP6) can work
   together, there is also some way for MIP and HMIP to co-operate.

   This document specifies how to implement a simple MAP reliability
   solution by multiple binding mechanism. This document only specifies
   MAP reliability. HA reliability is out of scope.

4.2 Adapted multiple binding registration flow

   In the proposed solution a new registration step is added in the
   procedure described in [RFC-5380], and in the new step MN sends one
   more Binding Update to HA. Additionally, some original steps are
   modified to achieve the solution.

   The proposed registration is illustrated in Figure 1.

      Figure 1. Adapted multiple binding registration flow
                for MAP reliability

   The detailed descriptions are as follows:

   (a) MN sends binding update message (binding RCoA and LCoA) to MAP as
       described in section 6.1 of [RFC-5380]. MAP sends
       binding acknowledgement message to MN, indicating the successful
       registration.

   (b) MN sends binding update message (binding HoA and RCoA) to HA as
       described in section 6.1 of [RFC-5380]. MN includes a BID-PRI
       parameter in the BU message as described in section 5.2.1 of
       [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] and sets the value of BID-PRI
       parameter to high priority. HA responds binding acknowledgement
       message indicating the successful registration.

   (c) MN sends one more binding update message (binding HoA and LCoA)
       to HA with a low binding priority indication in the BU message,
       as described in section 5.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].
       The mobile node's home address is used in the Home Address option
       and the LCoA is used as the care-of address in the source address
       field. The binding lifetime in the BU message SHOULD be equal to
       or less than the mobile node's binding lifetime with the MAP,
       which is received in the binding acknowledgement in step (a).

   (d) HA sends binding acknowledgement message to MN indicating the
       successful registration, which means HA has recorded the binding
       on <HoA, LCoA> pair. A bi-directional tunnel between the mobile
       node and the home agent is established.
   
   It should be noted that when MN detects the failure of the MAP, MN
   MAY send a binding update message to HA and set the lifetime equal to
   zero in the BU message.

Internet-Draft          MAP Reliability Extension              June 2009


   When MN detects MAP's recovery after a failure, MN should redo the
   registration operation as if the mobile node is entering a new MAP 
   domain.

   After the adapted multiple binding registration, HA gets a whole
   Binding Cache Entry for the mobile node. One example is illustrated
   in Figure 2.

                adapted multiple binding

4.3 MAP failure solution in HA manner

   In [RFC-5380] all the packets destined to MN are forwarded by MAP.
   This document provides a supplementary solution to overcome the
   failure on MAP. 

   The proposed reliability solution in HA manner is illustrated in
   Figure 3.

       (f)    |------->|        |        |        |
       (g)    |        |---------------->|        |
       (h)    |        |        |        |------->|
              |        |        |        |        |
       
      Figure 3. Proposed reliability solution in HA manner
       
   The detailed descriptions are as follows:

   (a) CN sends packet to MN. The destination address of the packet is
       set to HoA and the packet is routed to HA.



Cui                     Expires February 28, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          MAP Reliability Extension              June 2009


   (b) HA searches the BCE and finds the active binding to RCoA, which
       is BID 1 in Figure 2. So HA forwards the packet to MAP.

   (c) MAP also searches the BCE and finds the binding to LCoA. So MAP
       forwards the packet with the destination set to LCoA. The packet
       is routed to AR which is the MN's default router.

   (d) AR routes the packet to MN without any modification.

   (e) MAP gets out of service for some reason and HA detects the
       failure of MAP. The method to detect the failure is out of the
       scope of this document. HA updates the binding cache and BID 1
       in BCE of HA is set to Inactive status. BID 2 (HoA, LCoA) becomes
       the only active item in binding cache.

   (f) Another packet destined to MN is sent by CN to HA.

   (g) HA searches the BCE and finds the only active binding to LCoA. So
       HA sets the destination address of the packet to LCoA and
       forwards the packet to MN directly. The packet is routed to AR
       which is the MN's default router.

   (h) AR routes the packet to MN without any modification.

   It should be noted that when MN detects the failure of the MAP, MN
   would set the source address of the packets, which are destined to
   CN, to LCoA and sends the packets to HA. HA forwards the packets from
   MN to CN.

4.4 MAP failure solution in Route Optimization

   In Route Optimization manner, packets between MN and CNs are not
   routed through HA. The multiple binding in HA is unavailable for
   route optimization. The binding cache in CN replaces the role of the
   one in HA. So MN in route optimization may make adapted multiple
   binding in CNs to implement the MAP reliability instead in HA.

   MN sends BU message containing its LCoA and low priority indication
   to correspondent nodes to bind its HoA and its LCoA. Other operation
   and procedure are similar to the solution in HA manner.

4.5 Mobile Node operation

   In order to implement the MAP reliability solution MN should send one
   more binding message with low priority indication to bind its home
   address and its LCoA. The binding update message is sent to either HA
   in HA manner or CN in RO manner.

Internet-Draft          MAP Reliability Extension              June 2009


   The detailed method to implement adapted multiple binding is
   described in [I-D.ietf-monami6-multiplecoa] and
   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].

4.6 Home Agent operation

   Home Agent normally maintains the binding cache with only one item in
   the list. The home address is usually associated to RCoA in HMIP.
   This document extends the binding cache in HA to multiple bindings,
   which permit the home address to be associated to multiple CoAs in
   sequence. 
   
   The detailed method to extend the binding cache is described in
   [I-D.ietf-monami6-multiplecoa] and [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].

4.7 Correspondent Node operation
   
   The mechanism defined in this document is completely transparent to
   correspondent nodes in HA manner. In Route Optimization manner the CN
   maintains the binding cache with multiple binding as HA does in HA
   manner.
   
4.8 MAP operation
   
   The mechanism defined in this document is completely irrelative to
   MAP's operation. 

5. Conclusion

   This document specifies a reliability solution for MAP. In the
   solution an additional binding, which associates HoA and LCoA, is
   registered in home agent. By this means, the mobile node exposes its
   location to home agent and gets a redundant connection between mobile
   node and home agent. Since the location information is not crucial
   while the reliability is considerable, this solution may be
   implemented in the mobile network.

6. Security Considerations

   This document specifies a solution for MAP reliability by an adapted
   multiple binding mechanism. The solution incorporates the operations
   specified in [RFC-5380] (registration in MAP),
   [I-D.ietf-monami6-multiplecoa] (multiple binding operation) and
   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] (BID priority registration). This
   document uses the same security as described in [RFC-5380],
   [I-D.ietf-monami6-multiplecoa] and [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].

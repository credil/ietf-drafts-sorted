                  Mobility Considerations for 6LoWPAN
                   draft-williams-6lowpan-mob-03.txt

Abstract

   There has been discussion recently within the 6LoWPAN community
   regarding mobile usage scenarios.  Mobility considerations is
   required for the deployment of SmartGrids.  The mobility analysis for
   SmartGrid and 6lowpan deployment is required to ensure proper
   performance for the mobile usage cases.  Also, mobility in 6LoWPAN
   sensor networks may present unique challenges to the 6LoWPAN
   architecture.  Hence it is best to have mobility as a consideration
   upfront rather than an after thought in the development of 6LoWPAN
   milestones.  This document provides a mobility perspective to the
   6LoWPAN sensor network architecture.

Internet-Draft     Mobility Considerations for 6LoWPAN         July 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Protocol (IP) is rapidly becoming a more popular for
   interoperable End-to-End Smart Grid Networks.  Therefore, it is
   important to understand the different uses of the IP suite in
   Internet networking technologies for existing and emerging Smart Grid
   applications. 6lowpan will be a central component of SmartGrids.  The
   IETF 6LoWPAN working group was formed in 2004 to address the
   challenge of enabling wireless IPv6 communication over the newly
   standardized IEEE 802.15.4 low-power radio for devices with limited
   space, power and memory, such as sensor nodes.  IEEE 802.15.4 radio
   links, coupled with the interoperability and ubiquity of IP, will
   lead to exciting new deployment scenarios for these low-power
   networks.  Sensor wireless networks will be integrated into wired
   and/or wireless fixed infrastructure.  The integration of these
   sensor networks with the Internet and wireless infrastructure
   networks increases the network capacity, coverage area and
   application domains.  Such an integration requires that 6LoWPAN
   networks handle mobility scenarios.

   Mobility in 6LoWPAN networks for SmartGrid and other usage scenarios
   is being examined because users that are interested in sensor data
   will not always be stationary.  In addition, mobile users will need
   to inject a sensor query into the 6LoWPAN network while they are
   mobile.  Mobile users will also need to retrieve a sensor response
   from the 6LoWPAN network while they are mobile.

   It has also been shown that sensor mobility can be exploited to
   compensate for the lack of sensors and improve network coverage.
   [MOBCOVERAGE] It has also been shown that mobility helps with
   localization requirements by wireless sensor applications that depend
   on nodes accurately determining their locations [MOBLOCAL].
   Moreover, there has been a desire to deploy sensors mounted on mobile
   platforms such as automobiles and planes.

   The requirement for mobility and 6lowpan networks can be seen in
   usage scenarios for Mobile Command, Control and Collaboration
   systems: Public Safety Applications, Military Applications, Civilian
   Applications, Educational Centers, Urban security protection system
   ("Secure Model City" initiatives) ?Commercial and Residential
   Security Protection Systems, Metropolitan Mobile and Fixed Networks,
   and Smart Grids (Traffic and Power).

   Mobility will also play a role in the future interconnection
   framework for 6LoWPAN networks as it is expected that internetworking
   will not necessarily be limited to a way to transport information
   from and to remote hosts.  The foreseen degree of integration between
   sensor networks may reach upper levels of the protocol stack, where

   one network may offer services to others (including communication
   services).  In such a setting, even 6LoWPAN sensor network components
   may be heterogeneous, consisting of sensors with varied
   functionalities, capabilities and interconnection requirements.
   Currently, wireless sensor networks are beginning to be deployed at
   an accelerated pace.  It is not unreasonable to expect that in the
   near future, many segments of the world will be covered with wireless
   sensor networks that will be accessible via the Internet.
   Integration of wireless sensor networks with wireless local area
   networks and the Internet, while being important, comes with
   connectivity and security issues.

   What the authors have concluded through their extensive prototyping
   and deployment, it is best to have mobility as a consideration
   upfront rather than an after thought in the development of 6LoWPAN
   milestones.  This document provides a mobility perspective to the
   6LoWPAN sensor network architecture.

3.  Framework

3.1.  Extensions of the PAN Framework

   In practical deployment scenarios, 6LowPAN networks may not be
   isolated independent PANs.  A personal network will be logical
   networks, defined by appropriate security associations.  In practice
   personal networks will have potential huge geographical and
   topological span.  Personal networks will consists of both ad-hoc and
   infrastructure networks.  It will be user centric with the PAN (i.e.,
   Core PAN) as the central entity.  An extension of the PAN framework
   is provided in the diagram below.

   PAN and Vehicular Area network may join and change PANs.  Remote
   foreign devices may be accessed either by the Core PAN directly
   connecting to these ad-hoc networks or through the interconnecting
   structure.  The corporate and home network are connected to the
   Interconnecting structure and may have remote personal devices.  The
   extension of the PAN framework presented shows a diverse and huge
   geographical and topological span with a mobility presence various
   aspects of the architecture.

3.2.  Smartgrid service providers requirements

   Smart grid applications require a powerful, reliable, and secure
   service provider IP infrastructure to transport crucial information.
   The utility service provider network must take into account networks
   that integrate a variety of wireline and wireless technologies in
   order to extract full benefits.

   o  A smartgrid implementation should be scalable.

   o  A smartgrid implementation should be future-proof.

   o  A smartgrid implementation should easily accommodate the addition
      of new applications and upgrades to existing ones.

   o  A smartgrid IP communications implementation must ensure end-to-
      end security.  This includes complete privacy of the network from
      unauthorized access as well as confidentiality of communications
      across the network.

   o  A smartgrid Ip communications implementation must provide always
      on communication that coincides with or exceeds the reliability of
      the electric gird itself.  To ensure maximum availability, it
      needs fault tolerance and redundancy with self-healing failover.

   o  A smartgrid IP communications implementation must be capable of
      scaling to the large deployment footprints that are typical of
      utility companies.

   o  A smartgrid IP communications implementation must be capable of
      prioritized delivery of latency sensitive mission critical
      applications over latency insensitive traffic types such as
      metering data.

   o  A smartgrid IP communications implementation must be capable to
      support mobility to enable mobile workforce connectivity
      applications.

3.3.  Global reachability and changing connectivity

   6LoWPAN networks may require to be fully integrated into a dynamic
   mobile heterogeneous framework for ensuring global reachability to
   the individual 6LoWPAN nodes

   Sensor networks share several characteristics of ad-hoc scenarios in
   that sensor nodes are capable of receiving and forwarding packets to
   their peers.  However, tiny sensor devices may have more stringent
   processing power, memory and energy constraints than other types of
   ad hoc networks.  These constraints generally imply the need for a
   hierarchical ad-hoc network structure in which low-tier sensor nodes
   connect to the Internet via one or more levels of gateway devices.
   In this draft, we assume that each autonomous network of wireless
   sensor devices will have one gateway device.  This gateway device is
   responsible for media conversion (from 802.15.4 to another link layer
   technology, such as 802.11, and vice versa) and for route advertising
   to the outside world, which may be a wireless local area network
   connected to the Internet.

   There will be deployment scenarios where 6LoWPAN networks have
   persistent connectivity to the outside world via its gateway device.
   At the same time, there may be deployment scenarios that require that
   a 6LoWPAN network change its point of attachment to the outside world
   from an IP perspective.  This may occur, for example, when a sensor
   network is part of a moving vehicle which may roam from one wireless
   local area network to another wireless local area network with
   different IP network prefixes.  By the same token, an autonomous
   sensor network may be deployed in a location with no wireless (or
   wired) local area networks.  In this case, its connectivity to the
   outside world, when it exists, will be intermittent.  Also, the
   intermittent connectivity to the Internet may have different
   characteristics each time they occur.  For example, connectivity of
   the 6LoWPAN network to the internet may be realized via an agent
   (e.g., a vehicle) which features a satellite interface.  At different
   points in time, different agents may provide connectivity functions;
   in which case the point of attachment of the sensor network may
   correspond to a different IP address prefix.  Note that the two
   scenarios depicted above are equivalent from an IP connectivity point
   of view.  In the first scenario, the sensor network moves from one
   access network to another.  In the second scenario, agents with
   different IP addresses provide access functions to a stationary
   sensor network.  In either case, the IP address of the point of
   attachment will change over time.

   Here, the requirement is to provide global reachability to the
   6LoWPAN nodes no matter where the correspondent peers are located,
   and no matter what their point of attachment is.  The 6LoWPAN nodes

   must still be reachable with their originally prescribed IPv6
   addresses.

4.  Changing connectivity points of attachments

   Mobility is a fundamental characteristic of a wireless network with
   mobile users, and it is therefore anticipated that future networks
   will provide mobility support as an integrated and ubiquitous
   service.  Mobility scenarios anticipated in future networks include
   simple end-user migration from one subnetwork to another (as in
   cellular or WLAN hot-spot services), as well as more complex mobility
   patterns involving movement of radio routers and sensor network
   clusters.  Collections of sensor networks must be reachable as they
   move across different wireless domains.  Scalable and accurate
   indirection schemes need to be devised to allow for this
   functionality.

   Mobile IPv6 network mobility (NEMO) [RFC3963] defines a process that
   enables Mobile Networks to attach to different points in the
   Internet.  The protocol is an extension of Mobile IPv6 and allows
   session continuity for every node in the Mobile Network as the
   network moves.  Use of NEMO will enable all 6LoWPAN nodes to be
   accessible, no matter what the current point of attachment to the
   wide area IP network is.

   The NEMO client integration enables the sensor application residing
   on some correspondent node provides global reachability to the
   6LoWPAN nodes even when the access network for the 6LoWPAN network
   changes.

5.  Security of the mobile access network

   6LoWPAN networks may be deployed remotely in non-traditional
   scenarios.  Access networks for these 6LoWPAN networks may be
   intermittently available, and their IP address prefixes may change
   over time.  This means that the IP layer has new requirements to be
   able to provide access to these 6LoWPAN networks via changing access
   networks and to do so in a secure manner.

5.1.  Mobile security for the extended PAN

   IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery protocol (ND) [RFC2461] to
   discover other nodes on the link, to determine the link-layer
   addresses of other nodes on the link, to find routers, and to
   maintain reachability information about the paths to active
   neighbors.  If proper authentication mechanisms are not in place,
   straight use ND in sensor networks may introduce security
   vulnerabilities.  The IETF has created the Secure Neighbor Discovery
   Protocol (SeND) [RFC3971] to provide authentication services for the
   ND.  SeND may be used as a solution between the NEMO client residing
   in the Sensor network and the access network which will have a SeND
   service for providing authenticated NEMO autoconfiguration.  In this
   solution, NEMO with SeND may provide a means by which the access
   network is properly authorized to connect to the sensor network.

                                 Figure 3

   Authentication process specified in SeND may involve the use of
   server infrastructure for certificate management purposes.  It may be
   impractical to have a server infrastructure in place for
   authentication in the deployment scenarios discussed in this draft.
   Therefore, the Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972]
   option of SeND may be a useful tool for 6LoWPAN networks in providing
   authentication services.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security assumptions for stationary 6LoWPAN networks are inadequate
   for scenarios whereby mobility is introduced.  Mobile users injecting
   sensor queries into the 6LoWPAN network while they are mobile pose
   new security considerations.  This is also true when mobile users are
   retrieving sensor responses from the 6LoWPAN network while they are
   mobile.  Privacy and authentication is also an area for mobile
   security analysis.  For example, privacy between the 6LoWPAN network
   point of attachment and the local area access network may be
   established using IPsec.  More security analysis is required.

7.  Conclusion

   Practical deployment scenarios require mobility of both individual
   sensor nodes but also connectivity points for the PANs.  Mobility as
   an architectural consideration for 6LowPAN must be consider upfront
   rather than an after thought in the development of 6LoWPAN
   milestones.  Finally, techniques developed for other mobile networks
   may not be applicable in all usage cases, as in these networks power
   conservation is not a requirement.

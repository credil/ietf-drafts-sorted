1.  Introduction

   There are some situations that NewReno cannot recover quickly after
   the success of fast retransmission.  This issue is resulted from a
   feeble point in Fast Recovery algorithm in NewReno defined in RFC3782
   [RFC3782].  This document describes the point in Fast Recovery and
   presents possible scenarios.  This memo also propose a simple
   modification to fix this problem.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Since this document describes a potential risk in NewReno, it uses
   the same terminology and definitions in RFC3782 [RFC3782].  Which
   means this documents assumes that the reader is familiar with the
   terms SENDER MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE (SMSS), CONGESTION WINDOW (cwnd),
   and FLIGHT SIZE (FlightSize) defined in [RFC2581].

3.  Problem Description

   This section describes a potential risk in Fast Retransmit and Fast
   Recovery Algorithm in RFC3782.

   Section 3 in RFC3782 describes the Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery
   Algorithm in NewReno.  The algorithm consists of 6 steps.  The
   following lines are the description of the fifth steps which
   describes the behavior for the arrival of the first Full ACK after
   first retransmission.


   5)  When an ACK arrives that acknowledges new data, this ACK could be
       the acknowledgment elicited by the retransmission from step 2, or
       elicited by a later retransmission.

       Full acknowledgements:

       If this ACK acknowledges all of the data up to and including
       "recover", then the ACK acknowledges all the intermediate
       segments sent between the original transmission of the lost
       segment and the receipt of the third duplicate ACK.  Set cwnd to
       either (1) min (ssthresh, FlightSize + SMSS) or (2) ssthresh
       where ssthresh is the value set in step 1; this is termed
       "deflating" the window.  (We note that "FlightSize" in step 1
       referred to the amount of data outstanding in step 1, when Fast
       Recovery was entered, while "FlightSize" in step 5 refers to the
       amount of data outstanding in step 5, when Fast Recovery is
       exited.)

   According to this description, the cwnd after the first FULL ACK
   reception will be one of the followings.


            (1) min (ssthresh, FlightSize + SMSS)
            (2) ssthresh

   However, there is a risk in (1) which can cause performance
   degradation.  In (1), if FlightSize is zero, the result of (1) will
   be 1 SMSS. (ssthresh should be bigger than 1) This means TCP can
   transmit only 1 segment in this case.  This can cause the delay in
   ACK transmission at the receiver side if the receiver use delayed ACK
   algorithm.  The FlightSize in (1) represents the amount of data
   outstanding in the fifth step: the moment when the new Full ACK
   arrives.  The next section describes several scenarios where the
   FlightSize becomes zero.

4.  Possible Scenarios

   There are several possible situations that FlightSize becomes zero
   when the first new full ACK arrives after fast retransmission.  This
   section describe several possible cases.

4.1.  Case 1: Small Sending Window Size at Sender

   This is the tcpdump example of the case.  This log is recorded at A.


         1  10:41:00.000001 A > B: . 1000:2000(1000) ack 1 win 32768
         2  10:41:00.001001 A > B: . 2000:3000(1000) ack 1 win 32768
         3  10:41:00.002001 A > B: . 3000:4000(1000) ack 1 win 32768
         4  10:41:00.003001 A > B: . 4000:5000(1000) ack 1 win 32768
         5  10:41:00.010001 B > A: . ack 1000 win 16384
         6  10:41:00.011001 B > A: . ack 1000 win 16384
         7  10:41:00.012001 B > A: . ack 1000 win 16384
         8  10:41:00.013001 A > B: . 1000:2000(1000) ack 1 win 32768
         9  10:41:00.014001 A > B: . 5000:6000(1000) ack 1 win 32768
        10  10:41:00.024001 B > A: . ack 6000 win 16384
        11  10:41:00.025001 A > B: . 6000:7000(1000) ack 1 win 32768


   In this example, A sends data segments to B. At the beginning of the
   log, the cwnd of A is 4 SMSS, hence A sends 4 segments to B (line
   1-4).  Here, if the segment sent in line 1 (segment 1000:2000) is
   lost, B sends 3 duplicated ACKs for the lost segment (line 5-7) to
   ask retransmission.  At line 8, A receives 3 duplicated ACKs then it
   transmits the lost segment.  At line 9, A sets cwnd to ssthresh plus
   3*SMSS (as defined in the second steps in NewReno algorithm) and cwnd
   becomes 5 SMSS as the result.  This window inflation allows A to
   transmit one new segment.

   Since the two segments in line 8 and 9 are usually transmitted almost
   at the same time, the receiver may send back only one ACK for these
   two segments (line 10) The ACK received in line 10 is the first Full
   ACK and there is no out-standing data in this moment.  Hence, new
   cwnd is set to 1 SMSS and only one new segment is sent (line 11)

4.2.  Case 2: Zero Window Advertisement from Receiver

   This is the tcpdump example of the case.  This log is recorded at A.

         1  11:42:00.000001 A > B: . 1000:2000(1000) ack 1 win 32768
         2  11:42:00.001001 A > B: . 2000:3000(1000) ack 1 win 32768
         3  11:42:00.002001 A > B: . 3000:4000(1000) ack 1 win 32768

         8  11:42:00.011001 B > A: . ack 1000 win 0
         9  11:42:00.012001 B > A: . ack 1000 win 0
        10  11:42:00.012201 A > B: . 1000:2000(1000) ack 1 win 32768
        11  11:42:00.013001 B > A: . ack 1000 win 0
        12  11:42:00.014001 B > A: . ack 1000 win 0
        13  11:42:00.022001 B > A: . ack 7000 win 16384
        14  11:42:00.023001 A > B: . 7000:8000(1000) ack 1 win 32768


   In this example, A sends data segments to B. At the beginning of the
   log, the cwnd of A is 6 SMSS, hence A sends 6 segments to B (line
   1-6).  Here, if the segment sent in line 1 (segment 1000:2000) is
   lost, B sends duplicated ACKs for the lost segment (line 7-9 and
   11-12) to ask retransmission.  However, these duplicated ACKs sent
   from B have zero advertised window because of buffer overflow.  In
   this case, although the cwnd at A is inflated at the reception of the
   duplicated ACKs, it cannot transmit new segments.  Hence, only the
   lost segment is retransmitted (line 10).  When B receives
   retransmitted segment, the buffer becomes empty, then B sends a Full
   ACK with non-zero advertised window.  The ACK received in line 13 is
   the first Full ACK and there is no out-standing data in this moment.
   Hence, new cwnd is set to 1 SMSS and only one new segment is sent
   (line 14)

4.3.  Case 3: Lost of ACK segments

   This is the tcpdump example of the case.  This log is recorded at A.

        12  12:43:00.023001 A > B: . 7000:8000(1000) ack 1 win 32768

   In this example, A sends data segments to B. At the beginning of the
   log, the cwnd of A is 6 SMSS, hence A sends 6 segments to B (line
   1-6).  Here, if the segment sent in line 1 (segment 1000:2000) is
   lost, B generates 5 duplicated ACKS, however 2 ACK segments are lost
   in this case.  Then, only 3 duplicated ACKs arrives at A (line 7-9).
   At line 10, A transmits the lost segment and sets cwnd to ssthresh
   plus 3*SMSS.  As the result, the cwnd becomes 6 SMSS.  However, this
   cwnd does not allow A to transmit new segments.  At line 11, A
   receives the first Full ACK and there is no out-standing data in this
   moment.  Hence, new cwnd is set to 1 SMSS and only one new segment is
   sent (line 12)

5.  Discussion

   Some TCP implementations such as Linux, NS-2 Network simulator do not
   have this issue.  This is because these implementations always
   transmit more than 1 MSS right after fast recovery.  In these
   implementations, when TCP exits Fast Recovery (when the first FULL
   ACK is received) it also calls "open cwnd" function at the same time
   and performs Slow Start or Congestion Avoidance algorithm.  Hence,
   even though cwnd is set to 1 MSS after Fast Recovery as described in
   Section 3, the cwnd will be increased by 1 MSS by Slow Start.  (Since
   ssthresh should be bigger than 1 MSS at this moment, Slow Start is
   always used to increase cwnd)

   However, this behavior can be controversial because it enters Slow-
   Start after Fast Recovery without receiving any packets.  Although
   this point is unclear in RFC3782, we believe that this is rather
   aggressive behavior and TCP should not open cwnd after Fast Recovery
   without receiving another ACKs.  In fact, several implementation do
   not perform Slow Start right after Fast Recovery.  With these
   implementations, severe performance degradations can be observed over
   lossy networks.

6.  Proposed Fix

   To solve the problem mentioned above, we propose a simple fix to the
   fifth step in NewReno.

   The proposed solution is modifying the current cwnd adjustment:

              (1) min (ssthresh, FlightSize + SMSS)
      to
              (1) min (ssthresh, max(FlightSize, SMSS) + SMSS)

   This fix ensures that cwnd is always larger than 1 SMSS.  Hence,
   sender TCP can always transmit at least two segments right after the
   first Full ACK reception.  This can avoid the delay of ACK
   transmissions caused by delayed ACK algorithm.  The new algorithm
   increases 1 SMSS only when FlightSize becomes zero and behaves
   completely the same as the previous algorithm does in other
   situations.  The new algorithm might add slight burstness since it
   requires additional increase of cwnd.  However, we believe this
   burstness can be almost negligible.

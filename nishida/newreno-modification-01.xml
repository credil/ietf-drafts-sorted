	<section title="Introduction">
          <t>
	  There are some situations that NewReno cannot recover quickly after the success
	  of fast retransmission. This issue is resulted from a feeble point in Fast Recovery
	  algorithm in NewReno defined in RFC3782 <xref target="RFC3782"/>.
	  This document describes the
	  point in Fast Recovery and presents possible scenarios. This memo also propose a
	  simple modification to fix this problem.</t>

      <t>
	  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	  document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

      <t>
	  Since this document describes a potential risk in NewReno, it uses the same 
      terminology and definitions in RFC3782 <xref target="RFC3782"/>.
	  Which means this documents assumes that the reader is familiar with the 
	  terms SENDER MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE (SMSS), CONGESTION WINDOW (cwnd), 
      and FLIGHT SIZE (FlightSize) defined in <xref target="RFC2581"/>.

	  This section describes a potential risk in Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery
	  Algorithm in RFC3782. </t><t>
	    Section 3 in RFC3782 describes the Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery Algorithm
	    in NewReno. The algorithm consists of 6 steps. The following lines are the description
	    of the fifth steps which describes the behavior for the arrival of the first Full ACK
	    after first retransmission.</t>

  5)  When an ACK arrives that acknowledges new data, this ACK could be
      the acknowledgment elicited by the retransmission from step 2, or
      elicited by a later retransmission.

      Full acknowledgements:

      If this ACK acknowledges all of the data up to and including
      "recover", then the ACK acknowledges all the intermediate
      segments sent between the original transmission of the lost
      segment and the receipt of the third duplicate ACK.  Set cwnd to
      either (1) min (ssthresh, FlightSize + SMSS) or (2) ssthresh
      where ssthresh is the value set in step 1; this is termed
      "deflating" the window.  (We note that "FlightSize" in step 1
      referred to the amount of data outstanding in step 1, when Fast
      Recovery was entered, while "FlightSize" in step 5 refers to the
      amount of data outstanding in step 5, when Fast Recovery is
      exited.)

    According to this description, the cwnd after the first FULL ACK reception
    will be one of the followings. </t>

	  </figure>
     <t>
    However, there is a risk in (1) which can cause performance degradation.
    In (1), if FlightSize is zero, the result of (1) will be 1 SMSS. (ssthresh
    should be bigger than 1)  This means TCP can transmit only 1 segment in this case.
    This can cause the delay in ACK transmission at the receiver side if the receiver
    use delayed ACK algorithm. The FlightSize in (1) represents the amount
    of data outstanding in the fifth step: the moment when the new Full ACK arrives.
    The next section describes several scenarios where the FlightSize becomes zero.

<section title="Possible Scenarios">
 <t>
   There are several possible situations that FlightSize becomes zero when the first
   new full ACK arrives after fast retransmission. This section describe several
   possible cases.

   In this example, A sends data segments to B. At the beginning of the log,
    the cwnd of A is 4 SMSS, hence A sends 4 segments to B (line 1-4).
    Here, if the segment sent in line 1 (segment 1000:2000) is lost, B sends
    3 duplicated ACKs for the lost segment (line 5-7) to ask retransmission.
    At line 8, A receives 3 duplicated ACKs then it transmits the lost segment.
    At line 9, A sets cwnd to ssthresh plus 3*SMSS (as defined in the second steps
    in NewReno algorithm) and cwnd becomes 5 SMSS as the result. This window
    inflation allows A to transmit one new segment.
   </t>
    <t>
   Since the two segments in line 8 and 9 are usually transmitted almost at the same
    time, the receiver may send back only one ACK for these two segments (line 10)
    The ACK received in line 10 is the first Full ACK and there is no out-standing
    data in this moment. Hence, new cwnd is set to 1 SMSS and only one new segment
    is sent (line 11)

    In this example, A sends data segments to B. At the beginning of the log,
    the cwnd of A is 6 SMSS, hence A sends 6 segments to B (line 1-6).
    Here, if the segment sent in line 1 (segment 1000:2000) is lost, B sends
    duplicated ACKs for the lost segment (line 7-9 and 11-12) to ask retransmission.
    However, these duplicated ACKs sent from B have zero advertised window because of
    buffer overflow. In this case, although the cwnd at A is inflated at the reception
    of the duplicated ACKs, it cannot transmit new segments. Hence, only the lost
    segment is retransmitted (line 10). When B receives retransmitted segment, the
    buffer becomes empty, then B sends a Full ACK with non-zero advertised window.
    The ACK received in line 13 is the first Full ACK and there is no out-standing
    data in this moment. Hence, new cwnd is set to 1 SMSS and only one new segment
    is sent (line 14)

    In this example, A sends data segments to B. At the beginning of the log,
    the cwnd of A is 6 SMSS, hence A sends 6 segments to B (line 1-6).
    Here, if the segment sent in line 1 (segment 1000:2000) is lost, B generates
    5 duplicated ACKS, however 2 ACK segments are lost in this case. Then, only
    3 duplicated ACKs arrives at A (line 7-9).
    At line 10, A transmits the lost segment and sets cwnd to ssthresh plus 3*SMSS.
    As the result, the cwnd becomes 6 SMSS. However, this cwnd does not allow A to
    transmit new segments. At line 11, A receives the first Full ACK and
    there is no out-standing data in this moment. Hence, new cwnd is set to 1 SMSS
    and only one new segment is sent (line 12)
    </t>
    </section>
    </section>
<section title="Discussion">
<t>
Some TCP implementations such as Linux, NS-2 Network simulator do not have this issue.
This is because these implementations always transmit more than 1 MSS right after fast recovery.
In these implementations, when TCP exits Fast Recovery (when the first FULL ACK is received)
it also calls "open cwnd" function at the same time and performs Slow Start or Congestion 
Avoidance algorithm.
Hence, even though cwnd is set to 1 MSS after Fast Recovery as described in Section 3,
the cwnd will be increased by 1 MSS by Slow Start.  
(Since ssthresh should be bigger than 1 MSS at this moment, Slow Start is always used 
to increase cwnd) 
</t>

<t>
However, this behavior can be controversial because it enters Slow-Start after Fast Recovery
without receiving any packets. Although this point is unclear in RFC3782, we believe that 
this is rather aggressive behavior and TCP should not open cwnd after Fast Recovery 
without receiving another ACKs. In fact, several implementation do not perform Slow Start 
right after Fast Recovery. With these implementations, severe performance degradations 
can be observed over lossy networks.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Proposed Fix">
<t>
   To solve the problem mentioned above, we propose a simple fix to the fifth step
   in NewReno. 
          <figure> <preamble>
The proposed solution is modifying the current cwnd adjustment:
</preamble>
	    <artwork>
           (1) min (ssthresh, FlightSize + SMSS)
   to
           (1) min (ssthresh, max(FlightSize, SMSS) + SMSS)
	    </artwork>
	    <postamble></postamble>
	  </figure>
   This fix ensures that cwnd is always larger than 1 SMSS. Hence, sender TCP
   can always transmit at least two segments right after the first Full ACK reception.
   This can avoid the delay of ACK transmissions caused by delayed ACK algorithm.
   The new algorithm increases 1 SMSS only when FlightSize becomes zero and behaves
   completely the same as the previous algorithm does in other situations.
   The new algorithm might add slight burstness since it requires additional
   increase of cwnd.
   However, we believe this burstness can be almost negligible.

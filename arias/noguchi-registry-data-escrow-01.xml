        <section title="Introduction">
            
            <t>
                Registration Data Escrow is the process by which an Internet Registration 
                Organization (e.g., a registry, registrar, etc.) periodically submits data 
                deposits to a contracted third party called an Escrow Agent.  These deposits 
                comprise all the data needed to resume operations if the registration 
                organization could not function as a result of a catastrophe or a financial 
                situation.  For a domain name registry or registrar the data to be deposited
                includes all the objects related to registered domain names, e.g.,
                contacts, name servers, etc.
            </t>      
            <t>          
                The purpose of data escrow is to permit quick resumption of registration 
                service by another registration organization after a catastrophe.  The 
                goal is higher resiliency of registration services, for the benefit of 
                Internet users.  The beneficiaries of a registration organization are not 
                just those registering information there, but all relying parties that need 
                to identify the owners of objects.                     
            </t>        
            <t>        
                In the context of domain name registries, registration data escrow is 
                a requirement for the current generic top-level domains and it is 
                expected to be for new registries.  Some country code top-level 
                domain managers are also currently escrowing data. 
                There is also a similar requirement for ICANN's generic top-level 
                domain accredited registrars.                 
            </t>

            <t>
                DEPOSIT.
                Deposits can be of three kinds: Full, Differential or Incremental. For all kinds of Deposits, the 
                Universe of Registry objects to be considered for data escrow are those objects necessary in order to 
                offer the Registry Services.
            </t>
            <t>
                DIFFERENTIAL DEPOSIT. Contains data that reflects all transactions involving the database 
                that were not reflected in the last previous Full, Incremental or Differential Deposit, as the case may 
                be. Differential deposit files will contain information from all database objects that were added, 
                modified or deleted since the previous Deposit was completed as of its defined Timeline Watermark.
            </t>
            <t>
                ESCROW AGENT. The organization contracted by the Registry or the Third-Party Beneficiary to receive and 
                guard Data Escrow Deposits from the Registry.
            </t>
            <t>
                FULL DEPOSIT. Contains the Registry Data that reflects the current and complete Registry 
                Database and will consist of data that reflects the state of the registry as of a defined
                Timeline Watermark for the deposit.
            </t>     
            <t>
                INCREMENTAL DEPOSIT. Contains data that reflects all transactions involving the database that were not 
                reflected in the last previous Full Deposit. Incremental Deposit files will contain information from 
                all database objects that were added, modified or deleted since the previous Full Deposit was completed 
                as of its defined Timeline Watermark.
                If the Timeline Watermark of an Incremental Deposit were to cover the Watermark of another (Incremental
                or Differential) Deposit since the last Full Deposit, the former Deposit MUST contain the transactions 
                of the later Deposit.
            </t>
            <t>
                REGISTRY. The organization providing Registry Services for a RCDN.
            </t>
            <t>
                REGISTRY-CLASS DOMAIN NAME (RCDN): Refers to a top-level domain (TLD) or any other domain name at any 
                level in the DNS tree for which a Registry (either directly or through and affiliate company) provides 
                Registry services to other organizations or individuals. For example: .COM, .ORG, .BIZ, .CO.JP, .ORG.MX.
            </t>
            <t>
                REGISTRY SERVICES. Services offered by the Registry critical to the following tasks: the receipt of 
                data from registrars concerning registrations of domain names and name servers; provision to registrars 
                of status information relating to the DNS servers for the RCDN; dissemination of RCDN zone files; 
                operation of the Registry DNS servers; and dissemination of contact and other information concerning 
                DNS registrations in the RCDN. Any other products or services that only a Registry is capable of 
                providing, by reason of its designation as the Registry. Typical examples of Registry Services are: 
                DNS resolution for the RCDN, WHOIS and EPP.
            </t>
            <t>
                THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY. Is the organization that, under extraordinary circumstances, would receive the 
                escrow Deposits the Registry transferred to the Escrow Agent. This organization could be a backup 
                Registry, Registry regulator, contracting party of the Registry, etc.
            </t>
            <t>
                TIMELINE WATERMARK. Point in time on which to base the collecting of database objects for a Deposit. 
                Deposits are expected to be consistent to that point in time.
            </t>

        <section title="Problem Scope">
            
            <t>
                Since a few years ago, the issue of Registry continuity has been carefully considered in the gTLD and 
                ccTLD space. Various organizations have made risk analysis and developed Business Continuity Plans to 
                deal with those risks, should they materialize.
            </t>
            <t>
                One of the solutions considered and used, especially in the gTLD space, is Registry Data Escrow as a 
                way to ensure the Continuity of Registry Services in the extreme case of Registry failure.
            </t>
            <t>
                So far, almost every Registry that uses Registry Data Escrow has its own specification. It is also 
                anticipated that more Registries will be implementing Escrow especially with the advent of the new 
                gTLD program.
            </t>
            <t>
                Now, it would seem beneficial to have a standardized specification for Registry Data Escrow that can be 
                used by any Registry to submit its Deposits and, in case, to use those deposits to operate Registry 
                Services for a RCDN that has to be transitioned of Registry operator.
            </t>
            <t>
                A solution to the problem at hand SHALL clearly identify the format and contents of the Deposits a 
                Registry has to make, such that another different Registry would be able to rebuild the Registry 
                Services of the former, without its help, in a timely manner, with minimum harm to the Registrants, 
                Registrars and Internet users.
            </t>
            <t>
                Since the list and details of Registry Services vary from Registry to Registry, the solution SHALL 
                provide mechanisms that allow its extensibility to accommodate variations and extensions of the 
                Registry Services.
            </t>
            <t>
                Given the confidentiality and importance of some of the information that is handled in order to offer 
                the Registry Services, the solution SHALL define confidentiality and integrity mechanisms when handling 
                the Registry data.
            </t>
            <t>
                The solution SHALL NOT include in the specification those objects of such delicate confidentiality that 
                it is best to leave them out of the Deposits, e.g., DNSSEC KSK/ZSK private keys.
            </t>
            <t>
                Details that are a matter of policy SHOULD be identified as such for the benefit of the implementers.
            </t>
            <t>
                Legal issues around Data Escrow and the overall question of the use Registry Data Escrow are 
                outside of scope of this document.

                    In the case of Incremental or Differential deposits, the objects indicate whether 
                    the object was added or modified after the base previous deposit. In order to distinguish between
                    one and the other, it will be sufficient to check existence of the referenced object in the base 
                    previous deposit.

                    When applying Incremental or Differential deposits, i.e., when rebuilding the registry from data escrow
                    deposits, the order of the &lt;deletes&gt; and &lt;contents&gt; elements is important. First, all the 
                    deletes MUST be applied and then the adds and updates, i.e., first apply what is in &lt;deletes&gt; and 
                    later what is in &lt;contents&gt;.

                    The RDE registrar object is based on the EPP contact name mapping previously described. 
                    There are two elements used in this format related to registrars: the registrar object per se, 
                    used inside the &lt;contents&gt; element and the delRegistrar object used inside the 
                    &lt;deletes&gt; element.
                </t>

                    <t>
                        The &lt;registrar&gt; element contains the following child elements:
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        <list style="symbols">
                            <t>
                                An &lt;id&gt; element that contains the Registry-unique identifier of the 
                                registrar object. This &lt;id&gt; has a superordinate relationship to a subordinate
                                &lt;clID&gt;, &lt;crID&gt; or &lt;upID&gt; of domain, contact and host objects.

                                localized forms; a "type" attribute is used to identify the two
                                forms.  If an internationalized form (type="int") is provided,
                                element content MUST be represented in a subset of UTF-8 that can
                                be represented in the 7-bit US-ASCII character set.  If a
                                localized form (type="loc") is provided, element content MAY be
                                represented in unrestricted UTF-8.  The &lt;postalInfo&gt;
                                element contains the following child elements:

            <t>
                Data Escrow deposits are represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding information 
                using the Unicode character set and its more compact representations including UTF-8. Conformant XML 
                processors recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16. Though XML includes provisions to identify and use other 
                character encodings through use of an "encoding" attribute in an &lt;?xml?&gt; declaration, use of UTF-8 
                is RECOMMENDED.

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                This specification does not define the security mechanisms to be used in the transmission of the data escrow 
                deposits, since it only specifies the minimum necessary to enable the rebuilding of a Registry from 
                deposits without intervention from the original Registry.
            </t>
            <t>
                Depending on local policies, some elements or most likely, the whole deposit will be considered confidential. As
                such the Registry transmitting the data to the Escrow Agent SHOULD take all the necessary precautions
                like encrypting the data itself and/or the transport channel to avoid inadvertent disclosure of private data.
            </t>
            <t>
                It is also of the utmost importance the authentication of the parties passing data escrow deposit files. The 
                Escrow Agent SHOULD properly authenticate the identity of the Registry before accepting data escrow
                deposits. In a similar manner, the Registry SHOULD authenticate the identity of the Escrow Agent
                before submitting any data.
            </t>
            <t>
                Additionally, the Registry and the Escrow Agent SHOULD use integrity checking mechanisms to ensure the
                data transmitted is what the source intended. Validation of the contents by the Escrow Agent is RECOMMENDED
                to ensure not only the file was transmitted correctly from the Registry, but also the contents are also
                &quot;meaningful&quot;.

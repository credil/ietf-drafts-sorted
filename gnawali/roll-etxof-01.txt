                   The ETX Objective Function for RPL
                      draft-gnawali-roll-etxof-01

Abstract

   The ETX metric of a wireless link is the expected number of
   transmissions required to successfully transmit and acknowledge a
   packet on the link.  The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy
   Networks (RPL) allows the use of objective functions to construct
   routes that optimize or constrain a routing metric on the paths.
   This specification describes ETXOF, an objective function that
   minimizes ETX.  The RPL path computation using ETXOF results in
   minimum-ETX paths from the nodes to the DAG roots, i.e., paths that
   minimize the number of packet transmissions for packet delivery from
   nodes in the network to the DAG root.

1.  Introduction

   An objective function allows RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] to optimize or
   constrain the routing metric of a path.  RPL achieves this goal by
   selecting the parent among the alternate parents as dictated by that
   objective function.  For example, if an RPL instance uses an
   objective function that minimizes hop-count, RPL will select paths
   with minimum hop count.  Different objective functions optimize or
   constrain different metrics.

   The ETX metric describes the expected number of transmissions
   required to successfully transmit and acknowledge a packet on a
   wireless link.  The ETX metric is commonly used in wireless routing
   to distinguish between paths that require a large number of packet
   transmissions from those that require a smaller number of packet
   transmissions for successful packet delivery and acknowledgement.
   The nodes running RPL might use a number of mechanisms to estimate
   the ETX metric of a link [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics] and make it
   available for route selection.

   This specification describes ETXOF, an ETX Objective function for
   RPL.  ETXOF is an objective function that allows RPL to find a
   minimum-ETX path from the nodes to a root in the DAG instance.  The
   minimum-ETX path between a node and the DAG root is the path (among
   other paths between the source and the destination) that requires the
   least number of packet transmissions per packet delivery to the DAG
   root.  Thus, minimum-ETX paths are generally also the most energy-
   efficient paths in the network.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   This terminology used in this document is consistent with the
   terminologies described in [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology],
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], and [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].

   This document introduces one term:

   Path metric:  Path metric quantifies a property of an end-to-end
         path.  Path metrics can be used by RPL to compare different
         paths.

3.  The ETX Objective Function

   The ETX Objective Function, ETXOF, is designed to find the path that
   can be used to deliver a packet from a node to the root in a DAG
   instance with the least number of transmissions.  It does so by using
   the ETX metric defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics] as the link
   metric, computing a ETX Path metric based on the ETX link metric, and
   choosing paths with the smallest path ETX.

3.1.  Computing the ETX Path metric

   Nodes compute the ETX Path metric for each candidate neighbor
   reachable on all the interfaces.  The ETX Path metric represents the
   ETX cost of the path from a node to the root of the DODAG through the
   neighbor.

   Root nodes (Grounded or Floating) set the variable min_path_etx to
   MIN_ETX_PATH_CONST.

   A non-root node computes the ETX Path metric for a path to the root
   through each candidate neighbor by adding these two components:

   1.  The ETX metric for the link to a candidate neighbor

   2.  The min_path_etx advertised by that neighbor.

   A node SHOULD compute the ETX Path metric for the path through each
   candidate neighbor reachable through all interfaces.  If a node
   cannot compute the ETX path metric for the path through a candidate
   neighbor, the node MUST NOT make that candidate neighbor its
   preferred parent.

   If the ETX metric of the link to a neighbor is not available, the ETX
   Path metric for the path through that neighbor SHOULD be set to
   INFINITY.  This metric value will prevent this path from being
   considered for path selection, hence avoiding potentially high ETX
   paths.

   The ETX Path metric corresponding to a neighbor MUST be re-computed
   each time:

   1.  The ETX metric of the link to the candidate neighbor is updated.

   2.  A node receives a new min_path_etx advertisement from the
       candidate neighbor.

   This computation MAY also be performed periodically.  However, long
   intervals between periodic computation or deferring the computation

   for too long after new min_path_etx advertisements or updates to the
   link metric prevents a node from making parent selection decision
   based on the most up-to-date link and path quality information.

3.2.  Parent Selection

   After computing the ETX Path metric for all the candidate neighbors
   reachable through all the interfaces for the current DODAG iteration,
   a node selects the preferred parent.  This process is called parent
   selection.

   A node MUST select a candidate neighbor as its preferred parent if
   the ETX Path metric corresponding to that neighbor is smaller than
   the ETX Path metric corresponding to the rest of the neighbors,
   except as indicated below:

   1.  If the ETX Path metric of the current preferred parent is greater
       than the smallest ETX Path metric by less than
       PARENT_SWITCH_ETX_THRESHOLD, the node MAY continue to use the
       current preferred parent.

   2.  A node MAY declare itself as a Floating root, and hence no
       preferred parent, depending on the configuration.

   3.  If the ETX metric for a link is greater than MAX_ETX_LINK_CONST,
       the node SHOULD exclude that link from consideration for parent
       selection.

   4.  If min_path_etx is greater than MAX_ETX_PATH_CONST, the node MAY
       declare itself as a Floating root.

   5.  If the configuration disallows a node to be a Floating root and
       no neighbors are discovered, the node does not have a preferred
       parent, and MUST set min_path_etx to INFINITY.

   6.  If the ETX Path metric corresponding to multiple candidate
       neighbors are equal to min_path_etx, a node MAY use a different
       objective function to select the preferred parent among the
       candidates with the ETX Path metric equal to min_path_etx.  If
       the current preferred parent is one of the candidates with the
       ETX Path metric equal to min_path_etx, the node SHOULD continue
       to use the current preferred parent.  Continuing to use the same
       parent prevents potential churn in the network.

3.3.  Advertising the ETX Path metric

   Once the preferred parent is selected, the node sets its min_path_etx
   variable to the ETX Path metric corresponding to the preferred
   parent.  Thus, min_path_etx is the cost of the minimum-ETX path from
   the node to the root.  The value of the min_path_etx is carried in
   the metric container whenever DIO messages are sent.


4.  ETXOF Constants, Variables, and Parameters

   ETXOF uses the following variable:

      min_path_etx: The ETX path metric of the path from a node through
      its preferred parent to the root computed at the last parent
      selection.

   ETXOF uses the following constants:

      MIN_ETX_LINK_CONST: 1.0

      MIN_ETX_PATH_CONST: 1.0

   ETXOF uses the following parameters:

      MAX_ETX_LINK_CONST: Maximum allowed link ETX.

      MAX_ETX_PATH_CONST: Maximum allowed path ETX.

      PARENT_SWITCH_ETX_THRESHOLD: The difference between ETX of the
      path through the preferred parent and the minimum-ETX path to
      trigger new preferred parent selection.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requires an allocated OCP for ETX.  A value of 1
   is requested.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations to be developed in accordance to the output
   of the WG.

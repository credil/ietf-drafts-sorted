Internet-Draft                  RIPE-RWS                       June 20111.  Introduction   This document describes a pilot service for querying and displaying   data in the RIPE database.  The service is implemented using the HTTP   protocol [RFC2616] and conforms to the architectural constraints of   REST [REST].  In this document, we explain our reasons for new   interfaces (and limits of existing ones) as well as high level   functionalities of the API.  We did not include technical details of   our implementation, which can be found as a separate document and is   available at:   http://labs.ripe.net/Members/bfiorell/api-documentation.1.1.  Why REST?   The RIPE Database has a large number of power users: organisations   and individuals that make or maintain software which depends on the   RIPE Database.  The way these specialized clients interact with the   RIPE Database is dictated by historical and technical aspects of RPSL   and the Whois protocol.   RPSL ([RFC2622]) is the routing policy specification language, but   for historical and convenience reasons it actually specifies much   more than routing policies, there are many RFCs related to the RPSL   (see [RFC2622], [RFC2650], [RFC4012]) and in practice the language   describes more than 20 different types of RPSL objects, it is more a   formalisation of the way policy records have been stored and   exchanged in the existing Whois systems since to the late 80's   instead of a high level domain language specification.   The result is that the policy specification language and its   extensions are tightly coupled with the way policies are stored in   the existing Whois systems and vice versa, so any new system that is   implementing the language ends up reproducing a Whois system.   The qualities of RPSL and Whois are well known.  In this section we   highlight their limits by describing the way a client would interact   with the two Whois interfaces of query and update.   First scenario, a client needs to extract sensible information from   one or more Internet Registries like the RIPE Database, the steps   are:      prepare one or more queries and invoke a command line Whois client      program or open a TCP socket connection to one or more Whois      servers,      parse and post-process the RPSL responses, facing many intricacies      like continuation lines, end of line comments, comma separatedFiorelli                Expires December 11, 2011               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  RIPE-RWS                       June 2011   the underlying Registry implementation.   The SPI would sit on top of a Registry Database allowing the   composition of domain specific Services but also making real-time   interoperation between Registries and services on multiple   authoritative Databases possible to achieve.   With these forces and this vision the RIPE Database Group has been   prototyping the RIPE Whois RESTful Query and CRUD API and the related   XML schemas.   The choice of REST has been quite obvious, HTTP is nowadays the most   accessible protocol and it represents a good architectural blueprint   for stateless services, with its different HTTP methods, the resource   locator protocol, the HTTPS, etc.   For the representation schema we have designed a very relaxed   attribute oriented XML Schema.  We only apply a structural validation   via XSD, after some testing we decided to remove any form of   attribute or type validation in order to reuse the same schema on   different RPSL flavors.   The services support representational styles JSON, HTML and plain   text, all derived via XSL transformation, with the latter two to   showcase the transformation powers of XML and also to demo resource   navigation via lookup references on any HTML browser.   Content negotiation can be done using HTTP headers or appending a   file extension to the request URL.   The query services can be used on any RPSL based Whois server or   mirror.   For example in one request it is possible to execute the same Lookup   or Search request on all the Regional Internet Registries and return   all the responses as a unique set of resources.   Similarly can be done for the CRUD interfaces, building adapter   modules for the different update mechanisms provided by different   Registries given that they adopt the same set of resource types.   Actually we implemented an adapter for the Whois Syncupdates   interface in the form of an HTTP proxy.2.  Some features of the Query ServicesFiorelli                Expires December 11, 2011               [Page 5]
Internet-Draft                  RIPE-RWS                       June 2011      Single resource Lookup Service, given a primary key a type and a      registry it always return one and only one object.  It can also be      used to identify resources by URL bookmark.      Resolution of referenced resources.  Given a resource, all the      attribute values that represent references to other resource      contain an xlink anchor that can be followed to navigate and      browse networks of resources.      HATEOAS, the client can navigate through any network of resources      via xlinks without requiring any stateful information to be stored      on the servers, this comes as a benefit of the two previous      features.      Normalisation of comma separated values, when they represent      references to multiple resources.      Normalisation of continuation lines, end of line comments and      other RPSL intricacies.  This is still a work in progress and      still not complete because is difficult to test all the side      effects of this operation.  The only real solution would be to      deprecate continuation lines in RPSL and split them into multiple      attribute value pairs.      All the Query Services are available also on HTTPS.3.  Some sample invocation of the query services   A Lookup Service URL for an organization object:   http://apps.db.ripe.net/whois/lookup/ripe/organisation/ORG-BME1-RIPE   A Lookup Service URL for a route object:   http://apps.db.ripe.net/whois/lookup/ripe/route/193.6.23.0/24/AS2547   A Search Service URL on multiple registries: http://apps.db.ripe.net/   whois/   search.xml?flags=r&source=ripe&source=apnic&source=afrinic&   query-string=AS25474.  Some details on the CRUD Services   The CRUD Services are an attempt to split the single overloaded   generic update interface provided by Mail Updates and Syncupdates   into separate low level interfaces, each defining a simpler contract,   designed for programmatic use rather than for human interaction.Fiorelli                Expires December 11, 2011               [Page 6]
Internet-Draft                  RIPE-RWS                       June 2011   For example the existing update interfaces always require clients to   provide the entire RPSL resource in exactly the same text-format as   it is stored in the Whois database, even if the requested operation   is just a deletion.  A client will have to fetch the RPSL object from   the RIPE Database doing an appropriate query, than extract ony the   text blob that represent the resource to be deleted and finally it   will have to execute a request to the update service providing the   entire text and adding delete attributes and authorisation   credentials.   The new CRUD Services on the other hand provide a Delete interface   that only requires a primary key, a type, a registry identifier and   one or more passwords.  It is the equivalent of a lookup but is   executed with the HTTP Delete method.  It is exposed only on HTTPS.   The client will just have to send a request like: HTTP DELETE: https:   //lab.db.ripe.net/whois/delete/test/person/pp16-test?password=123 :   The server will just respond with an HTTP Status code indicating   success or failure, in case of failure different status codes will   indicate different error conditions.   On top of Create, Update and Delete methods we also prototyped some   attribute modification services that in one only request can   implement complex update workflow.   For example with one only HTTP request will be possible to execute   commands like:      replace all the attributes of a given type with a new set of      attribute,      remove all the attributes that have value matching the given      regular expression,      add a new set of attributes after the Nth attribute of type X.5.

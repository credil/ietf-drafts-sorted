Abstract

   This memo specifies modifications required to DS-Lite so that both
   IPv4/ IPv6 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4/ IPv6 servers.

   The DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand
   element (B4) proxying IGMP and then tunneling IGMP messages to DS-
   Lite Address Family Transition Router element (AFTR).  IPv4 multicast
   data received at AFTR is tunneled to B$ and then delivered to the
   hosts.  IPv6 multicast and MLD can be supported in a similar way.

Internet-Draft        Multicast Support for DS-Lite            June 2011


1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including DS-Lite
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] and 6rd [RFC5969].  DS-Lite
   enables IPv4 hosts to communicate with external hosts using IPv6 only
   network and moves the traditional NAT to the network.  B4 element's
   LAN side is dual stack and WAN side is IPv6 only.  B4 tunnels IPv4
   packets received from the LAN side to AFTR element after
   encapsulating IPv4 packet in an IPv6 packet.  AFTR decapsulates the
   packet, does a NAT operation and then sends the packet out to IPv4
   public internet.

   DS-Lite as defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] is unicast
   only, it does not support multicast.  In this document we specify how
   multicast from home IPv4 users can be supported in DS-Lite.  We also
   show how IPv6 multicast can be supported for home IPv6 users in DS-
   Lite.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], [RFC3810] and [RFC3376].


3.  Requirements

   This section states requirements on DS-Lite multicast support
   protocol.

   DS-Lite B4 MUST support IGMP Proxy as defined in [RFC4605].  DS-Lite
   B4 MAY support MLD Proxy.

   DS-Lite AFTR MUST support IGMP Querrier.  DS-Lite AFTR MAY support
   MLD Querrier.

   Both any source multicast (ASM) and source specific multicast (SSM)
   MUST be supported.


4.  Architecture

   In DS-Lite, there are hosts (possibly IPv4/ IPv6 dual stack) served
   by B4 element.  B4 is dual stack facing the hosts and IPv6 only
   facing the network or WAN side.  At the boundary of the network there
   is AFTR.  AFTR receives IPv4 packets tunneled in IPv6 from B4 and
   decapsulates them and sends them out to IPv4 network.

   In order to support multicast B4 implements IGMP Proxy function
   [RFC4605].  IPv4 hosts send their join requests (IGMP Membership
   Report messages) to B4.  B4 as a proxy sends aggregated Report
   messages upstream towards AFTR.

   AFTR is the default multicast querier for B4.  AFTR implements
   multicast router function or it could be another IGMP proxy.

   All the elements of DS-Lite multicast support system are shown in
   Figure 1.

5.  DS-Lite Multicast Operation

   In this section we specify how the host can subscribe and receive
   IPv4 multicast data from IPv4 content providers based on the
   architecture defined in Section 4.

   The hosts will send their subscription requests for IPv4 multicast
   groups upstream to the default router, i.e.  B4 Element.  After
   subscribing to the group, the host can receive multicast data from
   the B4.  The host implements IGMP protocol's host part.

   B4 Element is IGMP Proxy.  After receiving the first IGMP Report
   message requesting subscription to an IPv4 multicast group, B4
   establishes a tunnel interface with a AFTR.  The tunnel is IPv6 based
   but it will carry IPv4 traffic, IGMP messages back and forth and IPv4
   multicast data messages downstream.  This is similar to [RFC6224] but
   the operation is much simpler.  In DS-Lite environment there is no
   requirement to handle host mobility.  B4 does not have to keep more
   than one tunnel interfaces, a single interface is sufficient.  IGMP
   Proxy at the B4 does not have to have more than one proxy instances,



Sarikaya                Expires December 10, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Support for DS-Lite            June 2011


   a single instance is sufficient.

   B4 is regular IGMP proxy and it keeps IGMP proxy membership database.
   B4 inserts multicast forwarding state on the incoming interface, and
   merges state updates into the IGMP proxy membership database.  B4
   updates or removes elements from the database as required.  B4 will
   then send an aggregated Report via the upstream tunnel to the AFTR
   when the membership database changes.

   B4 answers IGMP queries from AFTR based on the membership database.
   B4's downstream link follows the traditional multipoint channel
   forwarding and does not pose any specific problems.

   B4 receives IPv4 multicast data from the AFTR tunneled over the
   tunnel interface.  B4 decapsulates the packet and then forwards it
   downstream.  Each member host receives the data packet based on Layer
   2 multicast interface.  No packet duplication is necessary.

   AFTR acts as the as the default multicast querier for all B4s that
   have established an IPv6 tunnel with it.  In order to keep a
   consistent multicast state between a B4 and AFTR, once a B4 is
   connected it will stay connected until the state becomes empty.
   After that point, the B4 may continue to use the tunnel for IPv4
   unicast traffic.

   According to aggregated IGMP reports received from a B4, AFTR
   establishes group/source-specific multicast forwarding states at its
   corresponding downstream tunnel interfaces.  After that, AFTR
   maintains or removes the state as required by the aggregated reports
   received from B4.

   At the upstream interface, AFTR procures for aggregated multicast
   membership maintenance.  Based on the multicast-transparent
   operations of the B4s, the AFTR treats its tunnel interfaces as
   multicast enabled downstream links, serving zero to many listening
   nodes.

   Multicast traffic arriving at the AFTR is transparently forwarded
   according to its multicast forwarding information base.  Multicast
   data is first replicated and then forwarded in IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel
   from AFTR to the corresponding B4.

5.1.  Tunnel Interface Considerations

   Legacy IPv4 in IPv6 tunneling is performed as in [RFC2473].
   Considerations specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite]
   apply.  Packets upstream from B4 carry only IGMP signaling messages
   and they are not expected to fragmentation.  However packets

   downstream, i.e. multicast data to B4 may be subject to
   fragmentation.

5.2.  Supporting IPv6 Multicast in DS-Lite

   IPv6 multicast can be supported in a way similar to IPv4 as described
   in Section 5.  B4 Element has MLD Proxy function.  Proxy operation
   for MLD [RFC3810] is described in [RFC4605].

   B4 receives MLD join requests from the hosts and then sends
   aggregated MLD Report messages upstream in an IPv6 in IPv6 tunnel.
   Tunnel addressing is in IPv6 and is as described in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].  Multicast membership database
   is maintained for all active IPv6 multicast groups the hosts
   subscribe.

   AFTR is MLD querier or another MLD Proxy.  It serves all B4s
   downstream and treats its tunnel interfaces as multicast enabled
   downstream links, serving zero to many listening nodes.  Multicast
   membership database is maintained based on the aggregated Reports
   received from downstream tunnel interfaces.

   IPv6 multicast data received from the multicast Single Source
   Multicast or Any Source Multicast sources are replicated according to
   the multicast membership database and the data packets are tunneled
   to the B4s that have one or more members of this multicast group.

   B4s receive multicast data upstream in the B4-AFTR tunnel and
   decapsulate it and then forward the packet downstream.  Each member
   host receives IPv6 multicast data packet from its Layer 2 interface.


6.  Solution Based on Layer 2 Multicast Support

   In this section we assume that Layer 2 multicast is supported in the
   network.  Layer 2 multicast support is done in order to forward
   multicast data downstream to the ports of Layer 2 devices, i.e.
   switches that requested a multicast group instead of flooding the
   data to all the ports.

   In the switches called snooping switches, multicast MAC address based
   filters are setup which link Layer 2 multicast groups to the egress
   ports.  When an IGMP Report message is received, the bridge will
   setup a multicast filter entry that allows (in case of a join
   message) or prevents (in case of a leave message) packets to flow the
   port on which the IGMP Report message was received.  In terms of IP
   multicast addresses the mapping is not unique as 32 IPv4 multicast
   addresses map to a single Ethernet multicast MAC address.

Internet-Draft        Multicast Support for DS-Lite            June 2011


   Snooping switches maintain a list of multicast routers and the ports
   on which they are attached called router ports.  For this purpose
   multicast router discovery protocol described in [RFC4286] is used.
   The switch sends an IGMP Multicast Router Solicitation message and
   the router sends IGMP Multicast Router Advertisement message in
   reply.

   The main functionality of a snooping switch is to forward multicast
   data packets based on the filters that are setup, i.e. to those
   egress ports with multicast groups downstream and also to the router
   ports.

   In a DS-Lite network the snooping switches MUST detect IGMP packets
   in the tunnel between B4 and AFTR.  This requires IPv4 snooping
   switches to be capable of reading IPv6 next header values.  A value
   of 2 indicates that an IGMP packet is encapsulated.  A value of 4
   indicates that an IPv4 data packet is encapsulated.  The switch
   operates its snooping on these types of packets.

   In case multicast is supported in Layer 2, AFTR after receiving a
   multicast data packet does not attempt to replicate the packet.  The
   packet replication is taken care of by the snooping switches.  So
   Layer 2 multicast support avoids packet duplication at AFTR which
   could be costly in some cases.

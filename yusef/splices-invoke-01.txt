          The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INVOKE Method
                     draft-yusef-splices-invoke-01

Abstract

   This document defines the SIP INVOKE method, which describes a
   mechanism by which a UA can invoke a well-defined action on a remote
   UA.  These actions are represented by well-defined URNs that must be
   registered with IANA.  

   This document also defines a new event package 'invoke', and the
   Action and Action-Progress request headers.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


   To simplify discussions of the INVOKE method and its extensions, the
   two terms below are being used throughout the document:

    o  INVOKE-Issuer: the UA issuing the INVOKE request

    o  INVOKE-Recipient: the UA receiving the INVOKE request

2.  Background

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] provides users with
   the ability to initiate, manage and terminate multimedia sessions.
   Many deployments have SIP applications in the SIP signaling path that
   get involved in the setup and management of these multimedia
   sessions.

   A SIP application is a program running on a SIP network element that
   provides some value-added function to a user. Some of these
   applications need mechanisms to monitor or/and control a SIP User
   Agent (UA).


   SIP already provides an extensible framework, SIP-Specific Event
   Notification [RFC3265], by which SIP UAs can monitor remote UAs and
   get indications that certain events have occurred. For example, the
   following are widely used event packages:

    o  Dialog package - call states

    o  Registration package - phone status

    o  Conference package - conference status



   SIP also provides a method for requesting UAs to perform certain
   task, i.e., REFER [RFC3515]. The REFER method has many limitations
   that prevents it from being the ideal method for application level
   interaction:


    o  The REFER method is overloaded with five distinct meanings as
       described in [draft-worley-sip-many-refers-00.txt]

    o  The body of the NOTIFY is always message/sipfrag and any
       application data must be delivered in the body of the sipfrag
       message.

    o  The referral progress indication is inside the body of the NOTIFY
       method, instead of headers in the NOTIFY method.

    o  Progress indications for accessing non-SIP resources are not
       clearly defined and use SIP progress indications.

    o  Implicit subscription is used, but explicit subscription is not
       allowed

    o  There is no way for the REFER-Issuer to ask the REFER-Recipient
       to keep the dialog alive after the referral.



   This document defines the INVOKE method, which describes a mechanism
   by which a UA can invoke a well-defined action on a remote UA.  These
   actions are represented by well-defined URNs that must be registered
   with IANA.  It also provides a mechanism that allows the INVOKE
   issuer to be notified of the outcome of the invoked action.
   Furthermore, It allows the INVOKE issuer to keep the dialog
   established with the INVOKE recipient open, to allow both sides to
   exchange application specific information.

   This document also defines the 'invoke' event package and the Action,
   Subscribe-Type and Action-Progress request headers.

3.  The INVOKE Method

   INVOKE is a SIP method as defined by [RFC3261].  The INVOKE method
   indicates that the INVOKE-Recipient should invoke the action
   specified in the request.

   An INVOKE request MAY be placed inside or outside the scope of a
   dialog created with a SUBSCRIBE request.


3.1.  The Action Header Field

   The Action header is a request header field as defined by [RFC3261].
   It only appears in an INVOKE request or a SUBSCRIBE request.

   The INVOKE method uses the Action header to hold a URN that
   represents the action to be invoked by the INVOKE-Recipient, e.g.
   urn:invoke:call:answer.

   The SUBSCRIBE method uses the Action header to hold a URN that
   represents the action or category of actions to be monitored by the
   INVOKE-Recipient.


3.2.  URN Structure

   The Namespace Identifier (NID) of the URN is intended to be in the
   formal space and assigned by IANA, as per the procedures of
   [RFC3406].  This document defines the 'invoke' namespace.

   The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of the URN includes the action
   name, and may be followed by a semi-colon and additional action-
   specific parameters.

   The action identifier has a hierarchical structure of categories
   separated by colon, and the right-most label is the action name.

   The reason behind the above structure is to avoid the creation of a
   namespace with a very long list of unrelated actions.

INTERNET DRAFT           The SIP INVOKE method             June 10, 2011


3.3.  URN Categories

   This document defines the following categories as part of the NSS of
   the URN:

      o call: to allow access to call actions available on a SIP UA,
        e.g. answer a call, decline a call, ...

      o conference: to allow access to conference actions available on a
        SIP UA, e.g.  add, remove, ...



3.4.  URN Actions

   This document defines the following actions:

    o  Answer call       - urn:invoke:call:answer
    o  Terminate call    - urn:invoke:call:terminate
    o  Decline call      - urn:invoke:call:decline
    o  Ignore call       - urn:invoke:call:ignore
    o  Send call to VM   - urn:invoke:call:sendvm
    o  Hold call         - urn:invoke:call:hold
    o  Unhold call       - urn:invoke:call:unhold
    o  Mute call         - urn:invoke:call:mute
    o  Unmute call       - urn:invoke:call:unmute
    o  Conference        - urn:invoke:conference:add
                         - urn:invoke:conference:remove

   Note that the very important "Make call" CTI primitive does not
   require a action URN since it is accomplished by sending a REFER with
   a URI identifying the resource (e.g., a sip, sips or tel URI).



3.5.  URN Action Parameters

   An action can be followed by a semi-colon and additional action-
   specific parameters. 

   For example:

   urn:invoke:call:answer;media=audio;transducer=speaker|headset

   This action indicates to the UA to answer the call and provide an
   audio answer and use either the speaker or headset for the incoming
   media.

   The following is a list of example action parameters:

    o  media=audio|video|audvid
    o  transducer=speaker|headset
    o  target=<AOR>
    o  direction=recvonly|sendonly|sendrecv
    o  abort


3.6.  Message Body Inclusion

    An INVOKE method MAY contain a body.  This specification assigns no
    meaning to such a body.  A receiving agent may choose to process the
    body according to its Content-Type or based on the action that the
    request invokes.




OPEN ISSUE: Header vs. Body?

   There has been some discussion on the list on the question of header
   field vs message body.  This is not the real issue, as either could
   conceivably be used.  Instead, the main issue is what is being
   invoked:  is it a named feature/action/event, or is it a script.  The
   authors strongly believe that the invocation of a script by the
   method would be a mistake.  This would introduce all kinds of
   security issues and vulnerabilities.  This mechanism is purposely
   defined using URNs - invoking a named feature/action/event.  While
   this might seem to limit the flexibility, it allows a UA to
   understand exactly what operation is being requested, and apply
   appropriate policy.  If a given feature, action, or event can not be
   carried out simply by referencing its name and perhaps a few
   parameters, then this means that it is not suitable for this
   mechanism.  If a true script execution is needed, existing scripting
   approaches such as CPL (Call Processing Language) [RFC3880] should be
   considered.

   Since the invocation is a simple named feature and not a generic
   script, the question of whether a header field of message body is
   appropriate.  Since it is just a name with at most a few parameters,
   the authors feel that a header field is sufficient to carry this, and
   a body is overkill and inefficient.

4.  Event Package

   This specification defines the new event package 'invoke', which
   enables one UA to monitor another UA for the invocation of a specific
   URN.


4.1.  Subscription

   The UA issuing the subscribe request can monitor either a specific
   action or a category of actions as specified in the Action header
   field. For example, a subscription to urn:invoke:call:answer would
   result in NOTIFYs being sent when this specific URN is invoked, while
   a subscription to urn:invoke:call would result in NOTIFYs being sent
   when any URN in this category has been invoked. 


4.2.  Progress Indication

   The Action-Progress header is used to allow the INVOKE-Recipient to
   report on the progress of the invoked action. The Action-Progress
   header MUST be added to the NOTIFY requests sent to the INVOKE-
   Issuer.


OPEN ISSUE: Some of these actions are not SIP actions. Should a new list
of generic response codes be defined for this purpose?


4.3.  Subscription Termination

   Either side can terminate the subscription using the normal [RFC3265]
   procedures. The SUBSCRIBE-Issuer, by sending a SUBSCRIBE request with
   expires 0, when it is no longer interested in receiving notification
   about a specific action or category of actions. The SUBSCRIBE-
   Recipient, by sending a NOTIFY with Subscription-Status: terminated,
   when it no longer wants to allow the SUBSCRIBE-Issuer to monitor a
   specific action or a category of actions.


4.4.  The Body of the NOTIFY

   A NOTIFY method MAY contain a body that is specific to the action
   invoked by the INVOKE request. A receiving agent MAY choose to
   process the body according to its Content-Type or based on the
   invoked action.

5.  User Agent Behavior

5.1.  Forming an INVOKE request

   INVOKE is a SIP request and is constructed as defined in [RFC3261].
   An INVOKE request MUST contain exactly one Action header field value.
   It MAY contain Target-Dialog header [RFC4538] to associate the action
   with an existing dialog.


5.2.  Processing an INVOKE request

   A UA accepting a well-formed INVOKE request MUST invoke the action
   identified by the URN in the Action header field value.

   An agent responding to an INVOKE method MUST return a 400 (Bad
   Request) if the request contained zero or more than one Action header
   field values.


5.3.  Request Authorization

   When a UA receives a request to invoke an action, it needs to
   authorize that request. Some requests can be authorized based on the
   identity of the sender, the request method, local policy, etc.

   The Target-Dialog mechanism [RFC4538] MAY be used when a user agent
   authorization depends on whether the sender of the request is
   currently in a dialog with that user agent, or whether the sender of
   the request is aware of a dialog the user agent has with another
   entity.

   In most cases, the same user will be logged in to the different
   devices using the same credentials provided in the REGISTER requests.
   In this case, all INVOKE requests MUST be challenged using the digest
   authentication mechanism described by [RFC3261]. 

5.4.  Action Progress Indication

   The NOTIFY mechanism defined in [RFC3265] MUST be used to inform the
   INVOKE-Issuer of the status of the action. 

   Each NOTIFY MUST contain an Event header field with a value of
   'invoke'. Each NOTIFY MUST contain an Action-Progress header field.
   The Action-Progress header allows the INVOKE-Recipient to report on
   the progress of the invoked action.

6.  Control Channel

   The INVOKE-Issuer MAY establish a Control Channel with the INVOKE-
   Recipient, using the subscription mechanism defined in [RFC3265], to
   allow both sides to exchange application specific information related
   to the invoked action.

   The INVOKE-Issuer MAY use INVOKE in the context of the Control
   Channel dialog to send application specific updates to the INVOKE-
   Recipient.

   The INVOKE-Recipient MUST use NOTIFY to send application specific
   updates to the INVOKE-Issuer.


7.  Capabilities Indications

   A UA compliant to this specification MUST indicate its support by
   including the option tag 'invoke' in the Supported header of all
   requests it sends.

   A new feature tag is defined to allow a User Agent to indicate which
   categories it supports. The new feature tag is described below:

   Feature tag name: invoke

   Each value of the invoke tag indicates a URN category supported by a
   SIP UA.  The values for this tag equal the URN category names that
   are supported by the UA.

   For example, a UA that supports the 'call' and 'conference'
   categories would look as follows:

   invoke="call,conference"



8.  Security Considerations

   The functionality described in this document allows an authorized
   party to manipulate SIP sessions and dialogs in arbitrary ways.  Any
   user agent that accepts these types of requests needs to be very
   careful in who it authorizes to send these types of requests.  The
   same security considerations as [RFC3515] apply.

10. IANA Considerations

   This specification defines the list of actions in section 3.4 as an
   initial set of URNs, to be registered with IETF, for use with this
   specification.

   In order to add any new action URN to the list above, it must go
   through the "IETF review" process as defined in [RFC5226].

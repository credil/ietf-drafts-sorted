   Abstract 

         Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching 
      (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label 
      Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may be established using signaling 
      techniques described in [RFC4875]. However, [RFC4875] does not 
      address many issues that comes when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in 
      an inter-domain networks. Specifically, one of the issues in 
      inter-domain networks is how to allow computation of a loosely 
      routed P2MP-TE LSP such that it is re-merge free. This document 
      provides a framework and required protocol extensions needed for 
      establishing and controlling P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in 
      inter-domain networks.  
       
         This document borrows inter-domain TE terminology from [RFC 
      4726], e.g., for the purposes of this document, a domain is 
      considered to be any collection of network elements within a 
      common sphere of address management or path computational 
      responsibility. Examples of such domains include Interior Gateway 
      Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASes).

   1. Introduction 

      [RFC4875] describes how to set up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) 
      Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) for use in 
      MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
      networks. 
       
      As with all other RSVP controlled LSPs, P2MP LSP state is managed 
      using RSVP messages. While the use of RSVP messages is mostly 
      similar to their P2P counterpart, P2MP LSP state differs from P2P 
      LSP in a number of ways. In particular, the P2MP LSP must also 
      handle the "re-merge" problem described in [RFC4875] section 18. 
       
      The term "re-merge" refers to the situation when two S2L sub-LSPs 
      branch at some point in the P2MP tree, and then intersect again 
      at a another node further down the tree. This may occur due to 
      discrepancies in the routing algorithms used by different nodes, 
      errors in path calculation or manual configuration, or network 
      topology changes during the establishment of the P2MP LSP. Such 
      re-merges are inefficient due to the unnecessary duplication of 
      data. Consequently one of the requirements for signaling P2MP 
      LSPs is to choose a P2MP path that is re-merge free. In some 
      deployments, it may also be required to signal P2MP LSPs that are 
      both re-merge and crossover free [RFC4875]. 
       
      This requirement becomes more acute to address when P2MP LSP 
      spans multiple domains. For the purposes of this document, a 
      domain is considered to be any collection of network elements

      within a common sphere of address management or path 
      computational responsibility. Examples of such domains include 
      Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems 
      (ASes). This is because in an inter-domain environment, the 
      ingress node may not have topological visibility into other 
      domains to be able to compute and signal a re-merge free P2MP 
      LSP. In that case, the border node for a new domain will be given 
      one or more loose next hops for the P2MP LSP. When processing a 
      path message, it may not have knowledge of all of the 
      destinations of the P2MP LSP, either because S2L sub-LSPs are 
      split between multiple Path messages, or because not all S2L sub-
      LSPs pass through this border node. In that case, existing 
      protocol mechanisms do not provide sufficient information for it 
      to be able to expand the loose hop(s) in such a way that the 
      overall P2MP path is guaranteed to be optimal and re-merge free. 
       
      RFC 4875 specifies two approaches to handle re-merge conditions. 
      In the first method that is based on control plane handling, the 
      re-merge node initiates the removal of the re-merge branch(es) by 
      sending a Path Error message. In the second method that is based 
      on data plane handling, the node detecting the re-merge case, 
      i.e., the re-merge node, allows the re-merge to persist, but data 
      from all but one incoming interface is dropped at the re-merge 
      node. This ensures that duplicate data is not sent on any 
      outgoing interface.  
       
      This document proposes RSVP-TE signaling procedures for P2MP LSP 
      to handle re-merge for both using control plane approach and data 
      plane approach. 
    
      Control plane solution is using crankback signaling in RSVP. 
      [RFC5151] describes mechanisms for applying crankback to inter-
      domain P2P LSPs, but does not cover P2MP LSPs. Also, crankback 
      mechanisms for P2MP LSPs are not addressed by [RFC4875]. This 
      document describes how crankback signaling extensions for MPLS 
      and GMPLS RSVP-TE defined in [RFC4920] can be used for setting up 
      P2MP TE LSPs to resolve re-merges. 
       
      Date plane solution described in [RFC4875] is extended by using a 
      new flag in RRO Attributes Sub-object in RSVP. The proposed 
      solution makes use of RRO Attributes Sub-object as defined in 
      [RFC5420] for this purpose.  This document describes how new RRO 
      Attributes Flag can be used to handle P2MP re-merge conditions 
      efficiently.  
       
      The solutions presented in this document do not guarantee 
      optimization of the overall P2MP tree across all domains. PCE can

      be used, instead, to address optimization of the overall P2MP 
      tree. 
       
       
   2. Framework  

   2.1. Signaling Options 

      The four signaling options defined for P2P inter-domain LSPs in 
      [RFC4726] are also applicable to P2MP LSPs. 

         .  LSP nesting, using hierarchical LSPs [RFC4206]. 

         .  A single contiguous LSP, using the same SESSION and LSP ID 
           along its whole path. 

         .  LSP stitching [RFC5150]. 

         .  A combination of the above. 

      In the case of LSP nesting using hierarchical LSPs, the tunneled 
      LSP MUST use upstream-assigned labels to ensure that the same 
      label is used at every leaf of the H-LSP ([RFC5331], [I-D.ietf-
      mpls-rsvp-upstream]). The H-LSP SHOULD request non-PHP behavior 
      and out-of-band mapping as defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-no-
      php-oob-mapping]. 

   2.2. Path Computation Techniques 

      This document focuses on the case where the ingress node does not 
      have full visibility of the topology of all domains, and is 
      therefore not able to compute the complete P2MP tree. Rather, it 
      has to include loose hops to traverse domains for which it does 
      not have full visibility, and the border node(s) on entry to each 
      domain are responsible for expanding those loose hops. 

       
   3. Control Plane Solution 

      It is RECOMMENDED that boundary re-routing or segment-based re- 
      routing is requested for P2MP LSPs traversing multiple domains.  
      This is because border nodes that are expanding loose hops are 
      typically best placed to correct any re-merge errors that occur 
      within their domain, not the ingress node.

   3.1. Single Border Node  

      The ingress node is RECOMMENDED to select the same border node as 
      an ERO loose hop for all sibling S2L sub-LSPs that transit a 
      given domain. This reduces the chances of the sibling S2L sub-
      LSPs in remerging states, because a single border node has the 
      necessary state to ensure that the path that they take through 
      the domain is re-merge free. 
       
   3.2. Crankback and Path Error Signaling Procedure 

      As mentioned in [RFC4875], in order to avoid duplicate traffic, 
      the re-merge node MAY initiate the removal of the re-merge S2L 
      sub-LSPs by sending a Path Error message to the ingress node of 
      the S2L sub-LSP.  

      Crankback procedures for rerouting around failures for P2P RSVP-
      TE LSPs are defined in [RFC4920]. These techniques can also be 
      applied to P2MP LSPs to handle re-merge conditions, as described 
      in this section. 

      If a node on the path of the P2MP LSP is unable to find a route 
      that can supply the required resources or that is re-merge free, 
      it SHOULD generate a Path Error message for the subset of the S2L 
      sub-LSPs which it is not able to route. For this purpose the node 
      SHOULD try to find a minimum subset of S2L sub-LSPs for which the 
      Path Error needs to be generated. This rule applies equally to 
      the case where multiple S2L sub-LSPs are signaled using one Path 
      message, as to the case where a single S2L sub-LSP is signaled in 
      each Path message. RSVP-TE Notify messages do not include 
      S2L_SUB_LSP objects and cannot be used to send errors for a 
      subset of the S2L sub-LSPs in a Path message.  For that reason, 
      the node SHOULD use a Path Error message rather than a Notify 
      message to communicate the error.  In the case of a re-merge 
      error, the node SHOULD use the error code "Routing Problem" and 
      the error value "ERO resulted in re-merge" as specified in 
      [RFC4875]. 

      A border node receiving a Path Error message for a set of S2L 
      sub-LSPs MAY hold the message and attempt to signal an alternate 
      path that can avoid re-merge through its domain for those S2L 
      sub-LSPs that pass through it. However, in the case of a re-merge 
      error for which some of the re-merging S2L sub-LSPs do not pass 
      through the border node, it SHOULD propagate the Path Error 
      upstream to the ingress node. If the subsequent attempt by the 
      border node is successful, the border node discards the held Path 
      Error and follows the crank back roles of [RFC4920] and

   Internet-Draft  draft-ali-mpls-inter-domain-p2mp-rsvp-te-lsp-06.txt 
       

      [RFC5151]. If all subsequent attempts by the border node are 
      unsuccessful, the border node MUST send the held Path Error 
      upstream to the ingress node. 

      If the ingress node receives a Path Error message with error code 
      "Routing Problem" and error value "ERO resulted in re-merge", 
      then it SHOULD attempt to signal an alternate path through a 
      different domain or through a different border node for the 
      affected S2L sub-LSPs. 

      However, it may be that the ingress node or a border node does 
      not have sufficient topology information to compute an Explicit 
      Route that is guaranteed to avoid the re-merge link or node. In 
      this case, Route Exclusions [RFC4874] may be particularly 
      helpful. To achieve this, [RFC4874] allows the re-merge 
      information to be presented as route exclusions to force 
      avoidance of the re-merge link or node. 

      As discussed in [RFC4090] section 3.3, border node MAY keep the 
      history of Path Errors. In case of P2MP LSPs, ingress node and 
      border nodes may keep re-merge Path Errors in history table until 
      S2L sub-LSPs have been successfully established or until local 
      timer expires. 

   4. Data Plane Solution 

      As mentioned in [RFC4875], node may accept the remerging S2Ls but 
      only send the data from one of these interfaces to its outgoing 
      interfaces. That is, the node MUST drop data from all but one 
      incoming interface. This ensures that duplicate data is not sent 
      on any outgoing interface.  

      It is desirable to avoid the persistent re-merge condition 
      associated with data plane based solution in the network in order 
      to optimize bandwidth resources in the network.  

      RSVP-TE signaling extensions are defined in the following to 
      request P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording and indicate P2MP-TE Re-merge 
      Presence. 

   4.1. P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording Request Flag 

      In order to indicate nodes that P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording is 
      desired, a new flag in the Attribute Flags TLV of the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC5420] is defined as follows:

   Internet-Draft  draft-ali-mpls-inter-domain-p2mp-rsvp-te-lsp-06.txt 
       

            Bit Number (to be assigned by IANA): P2MP-TE Re-merge 
      Recording Request flag 

      The P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording Request flag is meaningful on a 
      Path message and can be inserted by the ingress node or a border 
      node.  

      If the P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording Flag is set to 1, it means that 
      "P2MP-TE Re-merge Presence" defined in the next section should be 
      used to indicate to the ingress and border nodes along the setup 
      of the LSP that a remerge is present but accepted and that 
      incoming traffic is being dropped for the given S2L. 

      The rules of the processing of the Attribute Flags TLV of the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object follow [RFC5420]. 

   4.2. P2MP-TE Re-merge Present Flag 

      The P2MP-TE Re-merge Present Flag is the counter part of the 
      P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording Request flag defined above. 
      Specifically, RSVP signaling extension is defined to indicate to 
      the upstream node of the re-merge condition and that incoming 
      traffic is being dropped for the given S2L. 

      When a node decides to accept remerge and drop traffic from an 
      incoming interface for an S2L due to the re-merge condition, and 
      understands the "P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording Request in the 
      Attribute Flags TLV of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object of the Path 
      message, the node SHOULD set the newly defined "P2MP-TE Re-merge 
      Present" flag in the RRO Attributes sub-object defined in [RFC 
      5420] in RRO.  

      The following new flag for RRO Attributes Sub-object is defined 
      as follows:  

       
            Bit Number (same as bit number assigned for P2MP-TE Re-
      merge Recording Request flag): P2MP-TE Re-merge Present flag  

            The presence of P2MP-TE Re-merge Present flag indicates 
      that the S2L is causing a re-merge. The re-merge has been 
      accepted but the incoming traffic on this S2L is dropped by the 
      reporting node.

   4.3. Signaling Procedure 

      When a node receives an S2L sub-LSP Path message with LSP 
      Attributes sub-object that has "P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording 
      Request" Flag set, and the node does not support data plane based 
      re-merge handling, and the S2L is causing a re-merge, the node 
      SHOULD reject the S2L sub-LSP path message and send the Path 
      Error with the error code "Routing Problem" and the error value 
      "ERO resulted in re-merge" as specified in [RFC4875]. 

      When a path message is received at a transit node and "P2MP-TE 
      Re-merge Recording Request" Flag is set in the LSP Attributes 
      sub-object, the node MAY decide to accept the re-merge S2L sub-
      LSP. In this case, before the Resv message is sent to the 
      upstream node, the node adds the RRO Attributes sub-object to the 
      RRO and sets the "P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording Request" Flag. .   

      When a transit node receives a reservation message for an S2L 
      that is causing a re-merge, the node SHOULD set the "P2MP-TE Re-
      merge Present" flag in the RRO Attributes sub-object in the 
      reservation message if it decides to drop the incoming traffic of 
      this S2L. "P2MP-TE Re-merge Present" flag in RRO Attribute sub-
      object is not set for the S2Ls if the node has selected the 
      incoming interface of the S2Ls to forward the traffic. 

      An ingress node MAY immediately start sending traffic on all S2Ls 
      in up state even when re-merges are present on some S2Ls of the 
      P2MP LSP.  

      Proposed signaling extensions allow an ingress node and a border 
      node to have a complete view of the re-merges on entire S2L path 
      and on all S2Ls of the P2MP tree and can take appropriate actions 
      to resolve re-merges and optimize network bandwidth resources. 
      The proposed signaling extensions are equally applicable to 
      single domain scenarios.  

      A node may need to select a different incoming interface to 
      forward traffic in future. In that case, a reservation change 
      message is sent upstream indicating the change by marking or 
      clearing the "P2MP-TE Re-merge Present" flag appropriately for 
      all effected S2Ls.  

      The re-merge node SHOULD NOT dynamically change incoming 
      interface to forward traffic to avoid unnecessary race 
      conditions.

      A border node due to local policy MAY remove the record route 
      object from the reservation message of the S2L sub-LSP and 
      propagate reservation message towards the ingress node. When such 
      a policy is provisioned, the border node may attempt to correct 
      the re-merge condition in its domain. If the border node is not 
      able to resolve the re-merge condition, the border node SHOULD 
      send the Path Error with the error code "Routing Problem" and the 
      error value "ERO resulted in re-merge" as specified in [RFC4875].  

   5. Security Considerations 

      This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
      above those identified in [RFC3209], [RFC4875], [RFC5151], 
      [RFC4920] and [RFC5920].  

       
   6. IANA Considerations 

      The following new flag is defined for the Attributes Flags TLV in 
      the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object. The numeric values are to be assigned 
      by IANA. 

      o  P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording Request Flag:  

            - Bit Number: To be assigned by IANA. 

            - Attribute flag carried in Path message: Yes 

            - Attribute flag carried in Resv message: No 

       

      The following new flag is defined for the RRO Attributes sub-
      object in the RECORD_ROUTE object. The numeric values are to be 
      assigned by IANA. 

      o  P2MP-TE Re-merge Recording Present Flag:  

            - Bit Number: To be assigned by IANA. 

            - Attribute flag carried in Path message: No 

            - Attribute flag carried in RRO Attributes sub-object in 
            RRO of the Resv message: Yes

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE Ext for MPLS-TP OAM Config       January 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the technology specific extensions of RSVP-TE
   for the configuration of pro-active MPLS Operations, Administration
   and Maintenance (OAM) functions.  In particular it specifies
   extensions to establish MPLS OAM entities monitoring a signaled LSP,
   and defines information elements and procedures to configure pro-
   active MPLS OAM functions.  Initialization and control of on-demand
   MPLS OAM functions are expected to be carried out by directly
   accessing network nodes via a management interface; hence
   configuration and control of on-demand OAM functions are out-of-scope
   of this document.

   Pro-active MPLS OAM is based on the Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (BFD) protocol [BFD].  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (BFD), as described in [BFD], defines a protocol that provides low-
   overhead, short-duration detection of failures in the path between
   two forwarding engines, including the interfaces, data link(s), and
   to the extent possible the forwarding engines themselves.  BFD can be
   used to track the liveliness of MPLS-TP point-to-point and p2mp
   connections and detect data plane failures.

   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes a profile of MPLS that
   enables operational models typical in transport networks, while
   providing additional OAM, survivability and other maintenance
   functions not currently supported by MPLS.  [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ] defines
   the requirements by which the OAM functionality of MPLS-TP should
   abide.

   BFD has been chosen to be the basis of pro-active MPLS-TP OAM
   functions.  MPLS OAM extensions for transport applications, which are
   relevant for this document, are specified in [BFD-CCCV], [MPLS-PM]
   and [MPLS-FMS].

1.3.  Overview of BFD OAM operation

   BFD is a simple hello protocol that in many respects is similar to
   the detection components of well-known routing protocols.  A pair of
   systems transmits BFD packets periodically over each path between the
   two systems, and if a system stops receiving BFD packets for long
   enough, some component in that particular bidirectional path to the
   neighboring system is assumed to have failed.  Systems may also
   negotiate to not send periodic BFD packets in order to reduce
   overhead.

   A path is only declared to be operational when two-way communication
   has been established between systems, though this does not preclude
   the use of unidirectional links to support bidirectional paths (co-
   routed or bidirectional or associated bidirectional).

   Each system estimates how quickly it can send and receive BFD packets
   in order to come to an agreement with its neighbor about how rapidly
   detection of failure will take place.  These estimates can be
   modified in real time in order to adapt to unusual situations.  This
   design also allows for fast systems on a shared medium with a slow
   system to be able to more rapidly detect failures between the fast
   systems while allowing the slow system to participate to the best of
   its ability.

   The ability of each system to control the BFD packet transmission
   rate in both directions provides a mechanism for congestion control,
   particularly when BFD is used across multiple network hops.

   As recommended in [BFD-CCCV], the BFD tool needs to be extended for
   the proactive CV functionality by the addition of an unique
   identifier in order to meet the requirements.  The document in [BFD-
   CCCV] specifies the BFD extension and behavior to meet the
   requirements for MPLS-TP proactive Continuity Check and Connectivity
   Verification functionality and the RDI functionality as defined in
   [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ].


2.  Overview of MPLS OAM for Transport Applications

   [MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK] describes how MPLS OAM mechanisms are operated to
   meet transport requirements outlined in [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ].

   [BFD-CCCV] specifies two BFD operation modes: 1) "CC mode", which
   uses periodic BFD message exchanges with symmetric timer settings,
   supporting Continuity Check, 2) "CV/CC mode" which sends unique
   maintenance entity identifiers in the periodic BFD messages
   supporting Connectivity Verification as well as Continuity Check.

   [MPLS-PM] specifies mechanisms for performance monitoring of LSPs, in
   particular it specifies loss and delay measurement OAM functions.

   [MPLS-FMS] specifies fault management signals with which a server LSP
   can notify client LSPs about various fault conditions to suppress
   alarms or to be used as triggers for actions in the client LSPs.  The
   following signals are defined: Alarm Indication Signal (AIS), Link
   Down Indication (LDI) and Locked Report (LKR).  To indicate client
   faults associated with the attachment circuits Client Signal Failure
   Indication (CSF) can be used.  CSF is described in [MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK].

   [MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK] describes the mapping of fault conditions to
   consequent actions.  Some of these mappings may be configured by the
   operator, depending on the application of the LSP.  The following
   defects are identified: Loss Of Continuity (LOC), Misconnectivity,
   MEP Misconfiguration and Period Misconfiguration.  Out of these
   defect conditions, the following consequent actions may be
   configurable: 1) whether or not the LOC defect should result in
   blocking the outgoing data traffic; 2) whether or not the "Period
   Misconfiguration defect" should result a signal fail condition.


3.  RSVP-TE Extensions

3.1.  MPLS OAM Configuration Operation Overview

   RSVP-TE can be used to simply establish (i.e., bootstrap) a BFD
   session or it can configure, at different level of details, all pro-
   active MPLS OAM functions.  When RSVP-TE is used to configure BFD,
   BFD MUST be run in asynchronous mode and both sides should be in
   active mode.

   In the simplest scenario RSVP-TE signaling is used only to bootstrap
   the BFD session.  In this case in the Path message the OAM Type in
   the "OAM Configuration TLV" is set to "MPLS OAM".  Only the "CC" OAM
   Function flag is set in the "OAM Configuration TLV" and a "BFD
   Configuration sub-TLV" is inserted in the "OAM Configuration TLV",
   carrying a "Local Discriminator sub-TLV" with the discriminator value
   selected locally for the BFD session of the signaled LSP.  The N bit
   MUST be set to enable timer negotiation/re-negotiation via BFD
   Control Messages.  The receiving node MUST use the Local
   Discriminator value received in the Path message to identify the
   remote end of the BFD session, select a local discriminator value and
   MUST start sending BFD Control Messages after it sent the Resv
   message.  The Resv message MUST include the LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object
   reflecting back the contents of the "OAM Configuration TLV", except
   that the "Local Discriminator sub-TLV" MUST carry the discriminator
   value used by the sender of the Resv message.  Timer negotiation is

   left to subsequent BFD control messages.  This operation is similar
   to LSP Ping based bootstrapping described in [BFD-MPLS].

   For detailed MPLS OAM configuration RSVP-TE can be used to configure
   all parameters of pro-active MPLS OAM mechanisms.  If "CC mode" OAM
   is to be established, the OAM Type in the "OAM Configuration TLV" is
   set to MPLS OAM, only the "CC" OAM Function flag is set in the "OAM
   Configuration TLV" and the "BFD Configuration TLV" is inserted in the
   "OAM Configuration TLV".  The "Local Discriminator sub-TLV" is used
   as described above.  Timer negotiation in this case is done via the
   RSVP-TE control plane, hence the N bit MUST be cleared to disable
   timer negotiation/re-negotiation via BFD Control Messages.  The
   "Timer Negotiation Parameters sub-TLV" MUST be present in the "BFD
   configuration TLV" to specify the acceptable interval for the BFD CC
   messages.

   When timer negotiation is done via the RSVP-TE control plane, two
   configuration options are available: symmetric and asymmetric
   configuration.  If symmetric configuration is required, S flag in
   "BFD configuration TLV" MUST be set.  If the flag is cleared, the
   configuration is completed asymmetrically in the two directions.
   Section 3.3.2 includes a detailed explanation of such configuration.

   In the case of the "CV/CC mode" OAM [BFD-CCCV], the "CV" flag MUST be
   set in addition to the CC flag in the "OAM Configuration TLV".  The
   information required to support this functionality is defined in
   [MPLS-TP-IDENTIF] and can be found respectively in the SESSION and
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object with no need of further sub-TLV as described
   in section 3.2.

   Additional OAM functions can be requested by setting the PM/Loss and
   PM/Delay OAM Function flags in the "OAM Configuration TLV".  If these
   flags are set, corresponding sub-TLVs may be included in the "OAM
   Configuration TLV".

   If Fault Management Signals [MPLS-FMS] are required, the Fault
   Management Signals (FMS) OAM Function flag needs to be set in the
   "OAM Configuration TLV".  If this flag is set, an additional "FMS
   sub-TLV" may be included in the OAM Configuration TLV.

3.2.  OAM Configuration TLV

   Below is specified the "OAM Configuration TLV", defined in [OAM-CONF-
   FWK].  It specifies which OAM technology/method should be used for
   the LSP.  The "OAM Configuration TLV" is carried in the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object in Path messages.

   Type: indicates the "OAM Configuration TLV" (2) (IANA to assign).

   OAM Type: one octet that specifies the technology specific OAM Type.
   If the requested OAM Type is not supported, an error must be
   generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported OAM Type".

   This document defines a new OAM Type: "MPLS OAM" (suggested value 2,
   IANA to assign) from the "RSVP-TE OAM Configuration Registry".  The
   "MPLS OAM" type is to be set in the "OAM Configuration TLV" [OAM-
   CONF-FWK] to request the establishment of OAM entities for MPLS LSPs.

   The receiving LER when the MPLS-TP OAM Type is requested should check
   which OAM Function Flags are set in the "Function Flags TLV" and look
   for the corresponding technology specific configuration TLV.

   This document specifies the following sub-TLVs to be carried in the
   "OAM Configuration TLV" for MPLS OAM configuration.

      - "BFD Configuration sub-TLV", which MUST be included if the CC
      OAM Function flag is set.  This sub-TLV MUST carry a "BFD Local
      Discriminator sub-TLV" and a "Timer Negotiation Parameters sub-
      TLV" if the N flag is cleared.

      - "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV", which MAY be included if the PM/Loss
      OAM Function flag is set.  If the "MPLS OAM PM Loss sub-TLV" is
      not included, default configuration values are used.

      - "MPLS OAM PM Delay sub-TLV", which MAY be included if the PM/
      Delay OAM Function flag is set.  If the "MPLS OAM PM Delay sub-
      TLV" is not included, default configuration values are used.

      - "MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV", which MAY be included if the FMS OAM
      Function flag is set.  If the "MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV" is not
      included, default configuration values are used.

   Moreover, if the CV flag is set, the CC flag MUST be set at the same
   time.  The format of an MPLS-TP CV/CC message is shown in [BFD-CCCV]
   and it requires, together with the BFD control packet information,
   the "Unique MEP-ID of source of BFD packet".  [MPLS-TP-IDENTIF]
   defines the composition of such identifier as:

   <"Unique MEP-ID of source of BFD packet"> ::=
   <src_node_id><src_tunnel_num><lsp_num>

   GMPLS signaling [RFC 3473] uses a 5-tuple to uniquely identify an LSP
   within an operator's network.  This tuple is composed of a Tunnel
   Endpoint Address, Tunnel_ID, Extended Tunnel ID, and Tunnel Sender
   Address and (GMPLS) LSP_ID.

   Hence, the following mapping is used without the need of redefining a
   new TLV for MPLS-TP proactive CV purpose.

      - Tunnel ID = src_tunnel_num

      - Tunnel Sender Address = src_node_id

      - LSP ID = LSP_Num

   "Tunnel ID" and "Tunnel Sender Address" are included in the "SESSION"
   object [RFC 3209], which is mandatory in both Path and Resv messages.

   "LSP ID" will be the same on both directions and it is included in
   the "SENDER_TEMPLATE" object [RFC 3209] which is mandatory in Path
   messages.

   [Author's note: the same "Unique MEP-ID of source" will be likely
   required for Performance monitoring purposes.  However for the moment
   in [MPLS-PM] it is stated: "The question of ACH TLV usage and the
   manner of supporting metadata such as authentication keys and node
   identifiers is deliberately omitted.  These issues will be addressed
   in a future version of the document."]

3.3.  BFD Configuration TLV

   The "BFD Configuration TLV" (depicted below) is defined for BFD OAM
   specific configuration parameters.  The "BFD Configuration TLV" is
   carried as a sub-TLV of the "OAM Configuration TLV" in the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object both in Path and Resv messages.

   This new TLV accommodates generic BFD OAM information and carries
   sub-TLVs.

   Type: indicates a new type, the "BFD Configuration TLV" (IANA to
   define).

   Length: indicates the total length including sub-TLVs.

   Version: identifies the BFD protocol version.  If a node does not
   support a specific BFD version an error must be generated: "OAM
   Problem/Unsupported OAM Version &rdquo".

   PHB: Identifies the Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) to be used for periodic
   continuity monitoring messages.

   BFD Negotiation (N): If set timer negotiation/re-negotiation via BFD
   Control Messages is enabled, when cleared it is disabled.

   The "BFD Configuration TLV" MUST include the following sub-TLVs in
   the Path message:

      - "Local Discriminator sub-TLV";

      - "Negotiation Timer Parameters sub-TLV" if N flag is cleared.

   The "BFD Configuration TLV" MUST include the following sub-TLVs in
   the Resv message:

      - "Local Discriminator sub-TLV;"

      - "Negotiation Timer Parameters sub-TLV" if:

         - N flag and S are cleared

         - N flag is cleared and S flag is set and a timing value higher
         than the one received needs to be used

   Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval: in case of S (symmetric)
   flag set in the "BFD Configuration" TLV, it expresses the desired
   time interval (in microseconds) at which the LER initiating the
   signaling intends to both transmit and receive BFD periodic control
   packets.  If the receiving LER can not support such value, it is
   allowed to reply back with an interval greater than the one proposed.

   In case of S (symmetric) flag cleared in the "BFD Configuration TLV",
   this field expresses the desired time interval (in microseconds) at
   which a LER intends to transmit BFD periodic control packets in its
   transmitting direction.

   Acceptable Min. Asynchronous RX interval: in case of S (symmetric)
   flag set in the "BFD Configuration TLV", this field MUST be equal to
   "Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval" and has no additional
   meaning respect to the one described for "Acceptable Min.
   Asynchronous TX interval".

   In case of S (symmetric) flag cleared in the "BFD Configuration TLV",
   it expresses the minimum time interval (in microseconds) at which
   LERs can receive BFD periodic control packets.  In case this value is
   greater than the "Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval" received
   from the other LER, such LER MUST adopt the interval expressed in
   this "Acceptable Min. Asynchronous RX interval".

   Required Echo TX Interval: the minimum interval, in microseconds,
   between received BFD Echo packets that this system is capable of
   supporting, less any jitter applied by the sender as described in
   [BFD] sect. 6.8.9.  This value is also an indication for the
   receiving system of the minimum interval between transmitted BFD Echo
   packets.  If this value is zero, the transmitting system does not
   support the receipt of BFD Echo packets.  If the receiving system can
   not support this value an error MUST be generated "Unsupported BFD TX
   rate interval".

   Detection time multiplier: The negotiated transmit interval,
   multiplied by this value, provides the Detection Time for the
   receiving system in Asynchronous mode.

      - "BFD Configuration" type: 2;

      - "MPLS OAM PM Loss" type: 3;

      - "MPLS OAM PM Delay" type: 4;

      - "MPLS OAM PM FMS" type: 5.

   sub-TLV types to be carried in the "BFD Configuration sub-TLV":

      - "Local Discriminator" sub-TLV type: 1;

      - "Negotiation Timer Parameters" sub-TLV type: 2.


5.  BFD OAM configuration errors

   In addition to error values specified in [OAM-CONF-FWK] and [ETH-OAM]
   this document defines the following values for the "OAM Problem"
   Error Code:

      - "MPLS OAM Unsupported Functionality";

      - "OAM Problem/Unsupported TX rate interval".


6.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank David Allan, Lou Berger, Annamaria
   Fulignoli, Eric Gray, Andras Kern, David Jocha and David Sinicrope
   for their useful comments.


7.  Security Considerations

   The signaling of OAM related parameters and the automatic
   establishment of OAM entities introduces additional security
   considerations to those discussed in [RFC3473].  In particular, a
   network element could be overloaded, if an attacker would request
   liveliness monitoring, with frequent periodic messages, for a high
   number of LSPs, targeting a single network element.

   Security aspects will be covered in more detailed in subsequent
   versions of this document.

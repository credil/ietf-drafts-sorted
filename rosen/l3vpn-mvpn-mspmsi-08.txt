                MVPN: Optimized use of PIM via MS-PMSIs


                  draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-mspmsi-08.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies an optimized method that a service provider
   can use to provide MVPN service when using PIM as the MVPN control
   protocol.  As in prior MVPN methods, PIM control messages are sent
   over multicast tunnels through the provider network.  However, unlike
   older MVPN methods, the tunnels are only created if they are needed
   to carry multicast data traffic; no tunnels are used only for control
   traffic.

1. Specification of requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Introduction

   [MVPN] specifies how to run PIM [PIM] as the multicast routing
   protocol of a particular MVPN, by running it over an MI-PMSI for that
   MVPN.  In this specification, we provide a specification for running
   PIM over an MS-PMSI.  When PIM is run over an MI-PMSI, there may need
   to be P-tunnels that only carry PIM messages, but do not carry
   multicast data.  However, when PIM is run over an MS-PMSI, there is
   never any need to create a P-tunnel just for control messages; the
   only P-tunnels needed are those that carry multicast data.


2.1. Terminology

   In the following, we will sometimes talk of a PE receiving traffic
   from a PMSI and then discarding it.  If PIM is being used as the
   multicast control protocol between PEs, this always implies that the
   discarded traffic will not be seen by PIM on the receiving PE.

   In the following, we will sometimes speak of an S-PMSI A-D route
   being "ignored".  When we say the route is "ignored", we do not mean
   that its normal BGP processing is not done, but that the route is not
   considered when determining which P-tunnel to use when sending
   multicast data, and that the MPLS label values it conveys are not
   used.  We will generally use "ignore" in quotes to indicate this
   meaning.


3. MS-PMSI: Multidirectional Selective PMSI

   [MVPN] defines three kinds of PMSI:

     - "Multidirectional Inclusive" PMSI (MI-PMSI)

       A Multidirectional Inclusive PMSI is one that enables ANY PE
       attaching to a particular MVPN to transmit a message such that it
       will be received by EVERY other PE attaching to that MVPN.







Rosen, et al.                                                   [Page 3]


Internet Draft    draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-mspmsi-08.txt      January 2011


     - "Unidirectional Inclusive" PMSI (UI-PMSI)

       A Unidirectional Inclusive PMSI is one that enables a particular
       PE, attached to a particular MVPN, to transmit a message such
       that it will be received by all the other PEs attaching to that
       MVPN.  There is at most one UI-PMSI per PE per MVPN, though the
       P-tunnel that instantiates a UI-PMSI may in fact carry the data
       of more than one PMSI.

     - "Selective" PMSI (S-PMSI).

       A Selective PMSI is one that provides a mechanism wherein a
       particular PE in an MVPN can multicast messages so that they will
       be received by a subset of the other PEs of that MVPN.  There may
       be an arbitrary number of S-PMSIs per PE per MVPN.

   In this document we add the notion of a "Multidirectional Selective
   PMSI" (MS-PMSI).  An MS-PMSI provides a mechanism that enables a
   subset of PEs in a given MVPN to multicast messages so that they will
   be received by the other PEs that are in the subset.  There may be an
   arbitrary number of MS-PMSIs per PE per MVPN.

   According to the definition of S-PMSI in [MVPN], only a single PE can
   transmit onto a given S-PMSI.  An MS-PMSI may be thought of as a
   collection of S-PMSIs, each of which has the same subset of PEs as
   transmitters or receivers.  Although each individual S-PMSI in the
   set has a single PE as transmitter, the collection of S-PMSIs has all
   members of the subset as transmitters, and all members of the subset
   as receivers.


3.1. A PE's Primary MS-PMSI

   Although a PE may belong to many MS-PMSIs, we allow one MS-PMSI per
   PE to be distinguished as the MS-PMSI that is that PE's "primary MS-
   PMSI".  A PE is considered to be advertising its primary MS-PMSI in a
   BGP S-PMSI A-D route if that route has the following properties:

     - the double wild card selector (C-*,C-*) [MVPN_WILD] is specified

     - the advertised S-PMSI is instantiated using one of the set of
       techniques described in the next section.

Internet Draft    draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-mspmsi-08.txt      January 2011


3.2. Instantiating MS-PMSIs

   There are a number of ways to instantiate MS-PMSIs.  These are
   specified in in the follow sub-sections.  Additional methods of
   instantiation may be added in the future.


3.2.1. Bidirectional P-Tunnels

   An MS-PMSI be instantiated as a bidirectional P-tunnel.  See
   [MVPN_BIDIR] for the details of advertising bidirectional P-tunnels.

   [MVPN_BIDIR] specifies two kinds of bidirectional P-tunnels (P-
   tunnels that are BIDIR-PIM [BIDIR-PIM] multicast trees, or that are
   MP2MP LSPs [MLDP] without PE distinguisher labels) that may only be
   advertised by their "roots" (as defined in that document).  It
   follows that a PE may advertise such a P-tunnel as the instantiation
   of its primary MS-PMSI only if that PE is the root of the P-tunnel.

   If PE1, PE2, ..., PEn are using a MP2MP LSP with PE Distinguisher
   labels to instantiate an MS-PMSI, the MP2MP LSP should be thought of
   as instantiating n MS-PMSIs, each one being the primary MS-PMSI of
   one of the PEs.  A packet traveling on the MP2MP LSP is said to be
   traveling PEi's primary MS-PMSI if it is carrying the PE
   Distinguisher label that the root of the LSP has assigned to PEi.


3.2.2. Unidirectional P-Tunnels

   For best efficiency, MS-PMSIs should be instantiated by bidirectional
   P-tunnels.  However, it is possible to instantiate MS-PMSIs as
   unidirectional P-tunnels, and this can be useful in certain
   circumstances.


3.2.2.1. PPMP LSPs

   An MS-PMSI can be implemented as a Point-to-Point-to-Multipoint
   (PPMP) LSP.  (See, e.g, the "shared P2MP LSP" of [mLDP] section 3.)
   The procedures for advertising a PPMP LSP in an S-PMSI A-D route are
   as follows.

   A new BGP attribute is defined, the "PPMP Label" attribute.  This is
   an optional transitive attribute defined as follows:







Rosen, et al.                                                   [Page 5]


Internet Draft    draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-mspmsi-08.txt      January 2011


                +---------------------------------+
                |  MPLS Label (3 octets)          |
                +---------------------------------+


   This attribute may be carried by a BGP S-PMSI A-D route that is
   advertising a primary MS-PMSI instantiated as a P2MP LSP.  The PPMP
   label is a downstream-assigned MPLS label assigned by the PE that
   originated the route carrying this attribute.

   A PPMP label MUST NOT be added to an S-PMSI A-D route UNLESS the
   route contains a PTA identifying a P2MP LSP, and the route is origi-
   nated by the root of the LSP.

   The rules for transmitting packets on a PPMP LSP are as follows:

     - The root of the LSP transmits normally, without using the PPMP
       label.

     - A PE which is not the root of the LSP transmits a packet on the
       LSP as follows:

         * it pushes the PPMP label onto the packet's label stack, then

         * it unicasts the packet to the PE that is the root of the LSP;
           this requires pushing another label onto the packet's label
           stack.

   When the packet is received (as a unicast) by the PE at root of the
   LSP, the PPMP label will either be at the top of the label stack (if
   penultimate hop popping is in use), or else will rise to the .  The
   PPMP label is then popped from the stack, and that PE processes
   packet's label stack, recognizes the PPMP label, and as a result
   retransmits the packet on the corresponding P2MP LSP.  In addition,
   the PE at the root of the P2MP processes the received packet as a
   multicast packet in the context of the VPN corresponding to the PPMP
   label.  (The relationship between a PPMP label and a VPN is
   established by the RTs carried by the S-PMSI A-D route that
   advertised the PPMP label.)

   Note that when an MS-PMSI is instantiated as a PPMP LSP, the PE that
   transmits a given packet may receive it back.  A PE MUST discard,
   without processing, any packet it receives from the PPMP LSP if it
   transmitted that packet to the PPMP LSP.  As a result, the procedure
   of instantiating an MS-PMSI as a PPMP LSP MUST NOT be used UNLESS
   there is a method by which a PE can identify the packets it
   transmitted.  It is recommended to use this method only for
   transmitting PIM control packets, rather than multicast data packets.

Internet Draft    draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-mspmsi-08.txt      January 2011


3.2.2.2. Sparse Mode ASM Groups

   One way to instantiate an MS-PMSI is to use a set of PIM sparse mode
   ASM groups. A PE advertises its primary MS-PMSI by sending an S-PMSI
   A-D route whose PTA identifies a "PIM-SM Tree".  Every PE would have
   to advertise a PIM-SM tree with a distinct ASM ("Any Source
   Multicast") group address.  To transmit a packet on the primary
   MS-PMSI of a particular PE, the packet would be encapsulated in GRE,
   with the GRE header's IP source address being the IP address of the
   transmitting PE, and the GRE header's IP destination address being
   the group address that was advertised for that MS-PMSI.

   Generally speaking, this is not an efficient method of instantiating
   an MS-PMSI.  However, it can be useful in certain circumstances, such
   as the "hub and spoke" MVPN discussed in [MVPN_EXTRANET].  It can
   also be useful as a transitional method of instantiating MS-PMSIs,
   allowing MS-PMSIs to be used in a network even if that network has
   not (yet) deployed native MPLS multicast techniques.


4. PIM over MS-PMSI

   [MVPN] provides two alternative means of distributing C-multicast
   routing information:  PIM or BGP.  Procedures for running PIM over
   MI-PMSI are specified in that document.  However, a number of
   efficiencies can be obtained by running PIM instead over MS-PMSI.
   The procedures for this are as follows.

   Each PE that attaches to a given MVPN MUST originate an Intra-AS
   I-PMSI A-D route that does NOT contain a PTA.  Each such PE MUST also
   advertise a primary MS-PMSI instantiated by one of the methods
   described in the previous section.

   If PE1 needs to direct a PIM Join/Prune message to PE2, PE1 MUST join
   the PE2's primary MS-PMSI by joining the P-tunnel advertised in PE2's
   corresponding S-PMSI A-D route.  The PIM J/P messages MUST be sent
   over that MS-PMSI.

   If PE1 does not need to direct a PIM Join/Prune message to PE2, then
   PE1 SHOULD NOT join the P-tunnel advertised in PE2's S-PMSI A-D
   route, as PE1 will not be receiving any multicast data on that LSP.
   In the "PIM over MI-PMSI" scheme of [MVPN], if PE1 attaches to a
   given MVPN, the number of P-tunnels that it has to join for that MVPN
   is on the order of the total number of PEs attached to that MVPN.  In
   the "PIM over MS-PMSI" scheme, the number of P-tunnels that PE1 has
   to join is on the order of the total number of PEs attached to those
   sites of the MVPN that contain multicast transmitters.  In many
   deployments, only a small proportion of a VPN's sites contain



Rosen, et al.                                                   [Page 7]


Internet Draft    draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-mspmsi-08.txt      January 2011


   multicast transmitters, in which case the MS-PMSI scheme can result
   in a considerable reduction in the total number of P-tunnels.

   Note that if PE1 and PE3 both need to send PIM Join/Prune messages to
   PE2, then PE1 and PE3 both join PE2's primary MS-PMSI.  As a result,
   PE1 will see the Join/Prune messages that PE3 sends to PE2, and PE3
   will see the one that PE1 sends to PE2.  This allows such PIM
   procedures as "join suppression" and "prune override" to work
   normally, without impacting any PEs that do not send PIM Join/Prune
   messages to PE2.

   At some time after PE1 has joined the P-tunnel instantiating PE2's
   primary MS-PMSI, PE1 may find that it no longer has any need to send
   PIM J/P messages to PE2.  PE1 SHOULD NOT immediately prune itself
   from the P-tunnel, but SHOULD instead remain joined to the P-tunnel
   for a configurable amount of time.  An implementation MUST provide a
   configurable parameter determining how long a PE remains joined to
   the P-tunnel instantiating an MS-PMSI when that PE no longer has any
   need to send PIM J/P messages on that tunnel.

   Any PE that sends a PIM Join/Prune message on a given P-tunnel is
   automatically considered to be a PIM adjacency of every PE that
   receives the message on that P-tunnel.  This implies that any PE
   receiving the LSP MUST accept a PIM Join/Prune message on that
   P-tunnel from any other PE, even if the PE that transmitted the
   Join/Prune messages has not previously transmitted a PIM Hello.  That
   is, the "adjacency relationship" does not depend on the reception of
   PIM Hellos.

   However, there is no harm if Hellos are sent, as the suppression of
   Hellos is only an optimization.  This optimization, allowing a PIM
   Join/Prune message from a given router to be accepted even if no
   Hello from that router has been received, is often deployed in non-
   MVPN scenarios, and would work even when MI-PMSIs are being used.
   Also, PIM Hellos may be useful in certain environments for OAM
   purposes.  Therefore, it MUST be possible to configure a PE to allow
   Hellos to be sent.  Any PIM Hellos that PE1 sends MUST be sent on the
   P-tunnel advertised in PE1's S-PMSI A-D route above.

   Standard PIM procedures are used, except for:

     - The above change in the adjacency maintenance procedures.

     - Changes in the "RPF determination" or "RPF checking" procedures
       as may be defined in [MVPN] or other documents extending or
       enhancing MVPN procedures, such as [MVPN_EXTRANET].

   If an MS-PMSI is instantiated as a bidirectional P-tunnel, then the



Rosen, et al.                                                   [Page 8]


Internet Draft    draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-mspmsi-08.txt      January 2011


   data handling procedures of [MVPN_BIDIR] will prevent PIM from ever
   seeing any packets that come from the wrong transmitter or that are
   in the wrong partition; when such packets are received they are
   discarded, rather than being passed to PIM's state machinery.  As a
   result, such packets do not cause Asserts to be generated.  Other
   standard PIM procedures, such as Join Suppression and Prune Override
   may come into play, however.

   If an MS-PMSI is instantiated as a PPMP tree, a PE that transmits a
   Join/Prune message will receive it back.  Any such message is easily
   identified by its source address, and MUST be discarded.  A PE only
   transmits data packets on its primary MS-PMSI, and hence does not
   receive them back.

   All other MVPN-specific PIM procedures are as specified in [MVPN].


5. IANA Considerations

   This document specifies a new BGP optional transitive attribute,
   "PPMP Label". A value must be assigned from the "BGP Path Attributes
   Registry".


6. Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those of
   [MVPN] and [MVPN-BGP].


7. Acknowledgments

   The "PPMP" mechanism is similar to a mechanism that appeared in
   earlier drafts of [MVPN], known as "unicasting to the root of a
   shared tree"; this mechanism was discussed among the authors of
   [MVPN].

   The possibility of using of sparse mode groups to instantiate MS-
   PMSIs arose from a discussion with Yakov Rekhter.

Internet-Draft           Tracker Peer Selection             October 2010


1.  Introduction

   ALTO provides information to network applications to improve network
   efficiency [2].  There are many ways that a network application can
   utilize ALTO information.  For example, an application may choose to
   utilize only the Network Map, another may use both the Network Map
   and the Cost Map, and yet another may use the Endpoint ranking.  It
   can be either a more centralized entity such as a tracker in a P2P
   application or the P2P clients that utilize ALTO information.  One
   P2P application may choose to use the information at the P2P clients
   during piece selection or rate scheduling, while another P2P
   application may use it during peer selection.  How to effectively
   utilize ALTO information is a challenge that P2P applications
   considering integrating with ALTO need to address.

   In this document, we present example techniques of how to integrate
   ALTO information into the peer selection process at a P2P tracker.
   We first present some key challenges.  We then present some
   techniques used in real trial examples that address the challenges.


2.  Challenges

   A P2P tracker selects a set of peers upon receiving a LISTING request
   of a peer.  Since a tracker may receive a large number of such
   LISTING requests, it is important that the tracker can handle each
   request with high efficiency while achieving effectiveness in
   utilizing available information.  The design of the data structures
   and algorithms at the tracker for peer selection is challenging and
   can have a major impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of peer
   selection.

   Specifically, there are two challenges in integrating ALTO
   information into the peer selection of a P2P tracker.

   o  Scalability: A P2P developer may have a small number of trackers
      to handle a large number of channels (files) each with multiple
      peers.  The peers might be distributed across multiple ISPs that
      provide ALTO information.  Thus, the storage and processing
      overhead caused by using ALTO information must be considered in
      order to scale to the increasingly larger P2P applications.  In
      addition, it may be necessary to scale the tracker of a
      particularly popular channel from a single machine to multiple
      machines.  In practice, many P2P applications may use multiple
      physical P2P trackers for a single channel for fault tolerance
      (e.g., when one tracker crashes) and/or connectivity reasons
      (e.g., poor connectivity between networks).

Internet-Draft           Tracker Peer Selection             October 2010


   o  Application-Network Information Fusion: When selecting peers, a
      tracker should consider not only ALTO information, but also peer
      properties known only to the application (e.g., instantaneous peer
      upload capacity) as well as application requirements.  In
      particular, a key concern of a P2P application is that solely
      considering ALTO information may lead to degraded application
      performance (e.g., slower download rate in a P2P file sharing
      application.)

   One of the simplest ways to implement peer selection is random peer
   selection using a single array storing all current peers.  Upon
   receiving a LISTING request, the tracker picks a random position in
   the array, and returns a set of peers starting from the chosen
   position.  A slightly different random peer selection algorithm is to
   repeatedly pick random numbers in the range of the size of the array
   to pick multiple random peers.

   An advantage of the preceding algorithm is scalability.  But it is
   lacking in network-application information fusion.  It does not
   consider peer properties during peer selection.  On the other hand,
   many P2P trackers already select peers considering peer properties.
   For example, one type of peer property often considered is peer
   upload capabilities.  Another type of peer property is the playpoint
   of a peer, in particular, in an VoD setting.  Also, in addition to
   using ALTO information, some existing P2P trackers already consider
   network location properties such as the ASN, the IP prefix, the geo
   location (e.g., city, country or latitude/longitude), or the set of
   nearest landmarks of a peer.


3.  Peer Classification Data Structures

   When peers are annotated with properties, we might envision that the
   peers are stored at a tracker in a table similar in format to
   Figure 1:

      -----------------------------------------------------------------
     | peer_id | IP | upld_cap | play_point | ASN | country | cty | .. |
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
     |  ...    |... |  ...     |  ...       | ... |  ...    | ... | .. |
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Figure 1: Using a Table to Store Peers

   A problem of a flat table is that it does not support peer
   classification to find peers with given properties.  Just as many
   databases build indices, many P2P trackers build inverted data
   structures such as map/hash in order to index to the pool of peers

Internet-Draft           Tracker Peer Selection             October 2010


   with a given property.

   In an abstract formulation, for each peer A requesting LISTING, the
   peer selection algorithm at the tracker determines a probability that
   any peer B will be returned to A, where the probability depends on
   the relative "match" between the properties of A and B. However, too
   much fine-grained tuning of the probabilities (there are O(N^2) such
   values, where N is number of peers) may not be necessary or feasible.
   Peer classification is a technique to aggregate peers into equivalent
   classes before peer selection to improve scalability.

3.1.  One-Level Key Partitioning

   Multiple examples exist in this category.  In one example, the key is
   a category of the uploading capacity of a peer.  For example, the
   tracker may classify peers as having high upload capacity, medium
   upload capacity, or low upload capacity.  Then according to the
   property of the peer issuing the LISTING request, the tracker selects
   fractions of peers from each category.

   In another example, the key can be the ASN or ISP name.  When the
   tracker receives a LISTING request from a peer, the tracker looks up
   the ASN/ISP of the peer, and indexes to the ASN/ISP to select peers.
   To avoid partition of the P2P topology or when there are not
   sufficient numbers of peers in the ASN/ISP, the tracker may select
   peers from other ASNs/ISPs.

3.2.  Hierarchical Partitioning

   In addition to a single level flat map, some trackers classify peers
   using multiple attributes and/or build multiple levels of indexing,
   utilizing a hierarchical partitioning of peers according to peer
   properties.

   One example is to use the hierarchical geo partitioning of peers
   first into country, then state/province, and then city.

   Utilizing the Network Map of ALTO, the tracker can classify each peer
   into the PID of each ISP providing ALTO Network Map.

   Extending the preceding examples of using one type of peer property,
   the partition keys at different levels can be from different
   categories.  For example, at the first level, the tracker might use
   peer upload capacity, the next level uses ISP as the key, and the
   third level uses PID.

Internet-Draft           Tracker Peer Selection             October 2010


3.3.  Comments

   There are several comments.  First, a tracker may partition peers
   from multiple perspectives.  For example, each ISP providing ALTO
   Network Map provides a classification of peers into its set of PIDs.
   Thus, a single IP address may belong to different PIDs from different
   Network Maps of different ISPs.  The tracker may build a
   classification tree for each ISP.  It is possible that these multiple
   trees can be merged into a single tree with a dummy ROOT.  We use a
   single classification tree as an example.

   Second, the nodes of different non-overlapping branches may overlap
   regarding the sets of peers contained in them.

   Second, it may not be straightforward or necessary to partition peers
   using certain properties.  For example, landmarks may not lead to
   easy partitioning of peers.


4.  Peer Selection Using Peer Classification

4.1.  Overview of Scheme

   We now look at a class of tracker peer selection techniques that
   utilize peer classification.  Each peer is located at a leaf node of
   a classification tree.  We consider the set of algorithms where the
   peer selection depends on the properties of the peer issuing the
   request.

   We introduce a concept called the "home" node of a peer issuing the
   LIST request.  The home node is identified first before peer
   selection.

   The peer selection is specified in the following way.  Associated
   with each "home" leaf node of the classification tree is an ordered
   list, where each element in the list contains two fields: the first
   is a pointer to a node in a peer classification tree, and the second
   indicates how and how much to select peers from the node.  It is
   important to notice that the list is ordered as the tracker picks
   peers in order.  It is straightforward to extend that the nodes may
   come from multiple classification trees.

   Figure 2 is an example.  We refer to the data structure containing
   the selected peers as the bucket.  The example specifies that when a
   peer A with "home" leaf node at n4 (high capacity peers from ISP1)
   issues a LISTING request, first fill 50% of the bucket containing
   peers to be returned to A from n4 (high capacity peers from same ISP)
   or no more peers available from n4, then continue to fill the bucket

   by choosing peers from n5 (low capacity peers from same ISP) until
   the bucket is 80% full or no peers available from n5, then continue
   to fill the bucket by picking peers from n2 (peers from ISP2) so that
   the bucket can be 95% full, and finally fill the remaining of the
   bucket from n3.  Note that the scheme intends that for n4, to pick
   more from the same ISP (80%), then ISP2 (15%), and then ISP3.  It
   also tries to pair high capacity peers more with high capacity peers.

     ...
     leaf n9: ...

4.2.  Extensions and Issues

   The preceding peer selection scheme is simple and flexible.  It can
   be efficiently implemented.  There can be multiple ways to extend the
   scheme.

   There are two remaining issues:

   o  First, how to design the classification tree?

   o  Second, how to create the traversal list of each leaf node?

   In addition to addressing the two preceding issues, this scheme may
   not be a general representation of some existing peer selection
   schemes.  For example, when the network location of a peer is
   represented by its set of close-by landmarks, a straightforward
   partition tree may not exist.  Instead, some other data structures
   and algorithms may be needed to pick the peers that are the closest
   measured by a special metric space measured by "closeness" of
   landmark sets.

5.  Peering Matrix

5.1.  Overview

   The Peering Matrix approach is an instance of the scheme of Peer
   Selection Using Partition Tree.  It has been used in several trials,
   including the Pando/Comcast trial [3].  The scheme has also been
   evaluated in the context of P2P Live Streaming.  Below, we present
   more details on Peering Matrix.  We also briefly summarize a set of
   results applying Peering Matrix to P2P Live streaming on the
   Planetlab.

5.2.  Partition Tree

   Recall that we name the peer issuing the LISTING request as A. There
   is a unique path Path(A) going up from the leaf node containing A to
   ROOT in the partition tree.  We consider the class of tracker peer
   selection algorithms that specify a (upper bound) target fraction of
   peers to be selected at each node n along Path(A).  The peer
   selection algorithm goes up along Path(A).  To be consistent, the
   fraction value at a node n should be no larger than that of the
   parent of n named Parent(n).

   Also, at each node n along Path(A), for each child c of n, the peer
   selection algorithm specifies how peers are distributed among the
   siblings of c.

   Consider an example in Figure 3:

                            ISP1
                          / |   \  \
                        /   |    \   \
                      /     |     \    \
                    /       |      \     \
                  PID1    PID2   PID3 ... PIDn

         Figure 3: Example: Using ALTO Network Map for building a
                           Classification Tree.

   Specifically, Figure 3 is a two level classification tree for an ISP,
   and each second level node represents a PID of the ISP.  Each PID is
   labeled with Fraction = 75%.  The ROOT has a fraction of 100%.  The
   sibling distribution of node PID1 node is 50%, 30%, 20% to PID2,
   PID3, and PID4 respectively.  This means that when a peer A from PID1
   asks for a list of peers, the tracker selects up to 75% peers at
   PID1, and fills the remaining (25%) at PID2 (up to 25% * 50%), PID3
   (25% * 30%), and PID4 (25% * 20%).

   During P4P trials, we used a three level partition tree for each ISP.

                            ROOT
                          / |   \  \
                        /   |    \   \
                      /     |     \    \
                    /       |      \     \
                  intra   ePID1  ePID2 ... ePIDn
               /   |    \
              /    |     \
           iPID1 iPID2 ...iPID

                Figure 4: Three-Level Peer Classification.

   One nice property of using per ISP classification tree is to
   implement a distributed tracker, where a tracker is responsible for
   the peers within a set of ISPs.  A peer may request LISTING from
   multiple trackers (e.g., located at different ISPs) that together are
   responsible for the channel.  The tracker hosting the "home" leaf of
   the peer uses peering matrix, while the other trackers return a small
   number of random peers for robustness.

5.3.  Computing the Peering Matrix: Bandwidth Matching

   To compute the sibling distribution at node intra and ROOT, the
   tracker estimates the aggregated upload capacity (a seed can use full
   upload capacity and a leecher achieves 70%) and demand of each PID
   and then conducts bandwidth matching as specified in [4].

   Specifically, The following diagram shows how the information flow as
   well as how to transform ALTO Network Maps and Cost Maps into peering
   matrix, considering application states.

      GetPeeringWeights: The request optionally includes swarm state
      information as a list of PIDs, and for each PID, the number of
      seeds and leechers and the aggregated download and upload capacity
      of clients within the PID.  The response is a matrix of peering
      weights amongst the PIDs included in the request, as computed from
      the set of Costs currently pulled from the ALTO Server.  If the
      request included swarm information, the returned weight matrix is
      tailored for the current state of the swarm.

5.4.  Computing the Peering Matrix: Generic

   Similar to the preceding, but instead of using estimated capacity and
   demand, it assumes that each PID has one peer.

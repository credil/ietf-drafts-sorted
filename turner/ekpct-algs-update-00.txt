Abstract 

   This document describes the conventions for using several Elliptic 
   Curve cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax 
   (CMS) encrypted key package content type. Specifically, it includes 
   conventions necessary to implement ECDH with EnvelopedData and ECDSA 
   with SignedData.

1. Introduction 

   This document describes the conventions for using Elliptic Curve 
   cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) 
   encrypted key package content type  
   [I-D.turner-encryptedkeypackagecontenttype].  Specifically, it 
   includes conventions necessary to implement the following CMS content 
   types: EnvelopedData [RFC5652] and SignedData [RFC5652].  This 
   document updates [I-D.turner-encryptedkeypackagecontenttype-algs].  
   Familiarity with [I-D.turner-encryptedkeypackagecontenttype-algs] and 
   [RFC5753] is assumed. 

   This document does not define any new algorithms; instead it refers 
   to previously defined algorithms.  

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFC2119]. 

2. EnvelopedData 

   When key agreement is used, ECDH [I-D.mcgrew-fundamental-ecc] MAY be 
   supported. 

3. SignedData 

   If an implementation encapsulates an EncryptedKeyPacakge with a 
   SignedData [RFC5652], then it MAY support the signature scheme ECDSA 
   [I-D.mcgrew-fundamental-ecc].

4. Public Key Sizes 

   The easiest way to implement the SignedData and EnvelopedData is with 
   public key certificates [RFC5280][RFC5480]. If an implementation 
   supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST support keys on P-256. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations from [RFC5280], [RFC5480], [RFC5652], 
   [RFC5753], [I-D.turner-encryptedkeypackagecontenttype-algs], and 
   [I-D.mcgrew-fundamental-ecc] apply. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   None.  Please remove this section prior to publication as an RFC.

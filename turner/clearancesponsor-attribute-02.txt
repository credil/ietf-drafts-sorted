Internet-Draft       Clearance Sponsor Attribute           October 2009 
    

Abstract 

   This document defines the clearance sponsor attribute.  This 
   attribute may be included in locations or protocols that support 
   X.500 attributes. 

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies the clearance sponsor attribute. This 
   attribute may be included in locations or protocols that support 
   X.500 attribute definitions to indicate the entity that sponsored the 
   clearance.  This attribute is only meaningful when the clearance 
   attribute [RFC3281bis] is also included. 

   This attribute may be used in authorization decisions.  For example, 
   a web server deciding whether to allow a user access could check that 
   the clearance sponsor present in the user's certificate is on an 
   "approved" list. The web server could also check that the included 
   clearance sponsor is on an "approved" list to issue the included 
   clearance. 

   NOTE: This document does not provide LDAP equivalent schema 
   specification as this attribute is initially targeted at public key 
   certificates [RFC5280] and attribute certificates [RFC3281bis].  This 
   is left to a future specification. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

1.2. ASN.1 Syntax Notation 

   The attributes are defined using ASN.1 [X.680]. 

2. Clearance Sponsor 

   The clearance sponsor attribute indicates the sponsor of the 
   clearance of the subject with which this attribute is associated.  
   This attribute is only meaningful if the clearance attribute 
   [RFC3281bis] is also present.  The clearance sponsor attribute is a 
   DirectoryString [RFC5280], which MUST use the UTF8String CHOICE, 
   string with a minimum size of 1 characters and a maximum of 32 
   characters.

Internet-Draft       Clearance Sponsor Attribute           October 2009 
    

   The following object identifier identifies the sponsor attribute: 

     id-clearanceSponsor OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {   
       joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
       dod(2) infosec(1) attributes(5) 68 
     } 

   The ASN.1 syntax for the clearance sponsor attribute is as follows: 

     clearanceSponsor ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
       WITH SYNTAX            DirectoryString { ub-clearance-sponsor } 
                              ( WITH CONSTRAINT { utf8String PRESENT} ) 
       EQUALITY-MATCHING RULE caseIgnoreMatch 
       SINGLE VALUE           TRUE 
       ID                     id-clearanceSponsor 
     } 

     ub-clearance-sponsor INTEGER ::= 32 

   There MUST only be one value of clearanceSponsor associated with a 
   particular certificate, as distinct sponsors SHOULD be represented in 
   separate certificates. 

3. Security Considerations 

   If this attribute is used as part of an authorization process, the 
   procedures employed by the entity that assigns each value must ensure 
   that the correct value is applied.  Further, once applied to the 
   object it must be bound to the object; this binding is normally 
   performed by digitally signing over the object and the attribute to 
   ensure data integrity. 

   While values of DirectoryString can include the NUL (U+0000) code 
   point, values used to represent clearance sponsors typically would 
   not.  Implementations of the caseIgnoreMatch rule must, per X.501, 
   consider all of the assertion value and attribute value in matching 
   and hence protect against truncation attacks. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.

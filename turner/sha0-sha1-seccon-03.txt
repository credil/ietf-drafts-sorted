Internet-Draft  SHA-0 and SHA-1 Security Considerations       2011-01-10


   described in the Simplified BSD License.

1.  Introduction

   The Secure Hash Algorithms, SHA-1 and SHA-2 family (SHA), are
   specified in [SHS]. A previous version of [SHS] also specified SHA-0.
    SHA-0, first published in 1993, and SHA-1, first published in 1996,
   are message digest algorithms, sometimes referred to as hash
   functions or hash algorithms, that take as input a message of
   arbitrary length and produce as output a 160-bit "fingerprint" or
   "message digest" of the input.  The published attacks against both
   algorithms show that it is not prudent to use either algorithm when
   collision resistance is required.

   [HASH-Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in Internet protocols and
   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's one-way
   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet
   protocols.  Familiarity with [HASH-Attack] is assumed.

   Some may find the guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in
   [SP800-57] and [SP800-131] useful.

2.  SHA-0 Security Considerations

   What follows are summaries of recent attacks against SHA-0's
   collision, pre-image, and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally,
   attacks against SHA-0 when used as a keyed-hash (e.g., HMAC-SHA-0)
   are discussed.

   The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   withdrew SHA-0 in 1996. That is, NIST no longer considers it
   appropriate to use SHA-0 for any transactions associated with the use
   of cryptography by U.S. Federal government agencies for the
   protection of sensitive, but unclassified information. SHA-0 is
   discussed here only for the sake of completeness.

   Any use of SHA-0 is strongly discouraged. Analysis of SHA-0 continues
   today because many see it as a weaker version of SHA-1.

2.1.  Collision Resistance

   The first attack on SHA-0 was published in 1998 [CHJO1998] and showed
   that collisions can be found in 2^61 operations.  In 2006,
   [NSSYK2006] showed an improved attack that can find collisions in
   2^36 operations.

   In any case, the known research results indicate that SHA-0 is not as
   collision resistant as expected. The collision security strength is

Internet-Draft  SHA-0 and SHA-1 Security Considerations       2011-01-10


   significantly less than an ideal hash function (i.e., 2^36 compared
   to 2^80).

2.2.  Pre-image and Second Pre-image Resistance

   The pre-image and second pre-image attacks published on reduced
   versions of SHA-0 (i.e., less than 80 rounds) indicate that the
   security margin of SHA-0 is resistant to these attacks. [deCARE2008]
   showed a pre-image attack on 49 out of 80 rounds with complexity of
   2^159 and [AOSA2009] showed a pre-image attack on 52 out of 80 rounds
   with a complexity of 2^156.

2.3. HMAC-SHA-0

   The current attack vectors on HMAC can be classified as follows:
   distinguishing attacks, existential forgery attacks, and key recovery
   attacks. Key recovery attacks are by far the most severe.

   Attacks on hash functions can be conducted entirely offline, since
   the attacker can generate unlimited plaintext-ciphertext pairs. 
   Attacks on HMACs must be online because attackers need a large amount
   of HMAC values to deduce the key. The best results for a partial key
   recovery attack on HMAC-SHA0 were published at ASIACRYPT 2006 with
   2^84 queries and 2^60 SHA-0 computations [COYI2006].

3.  SHA-1 Security Considerations

   What follows are recent attacks against SHA-1's collision, pre-image,
   and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally, attacks against SHA-1
   when used as a keyed-hash (i.e., HMAC-SHA-1) are discussed.

   It must be noted that NIST has recommended that SHA-1 not be used for
   generating digital signatures after Dec 31st 2010 and has specified
   that it not be used for generating digital signatures by U.S. Federal
   government agencies "for the protection of sensitive, but
   unclassified information" after December 31st 2013 [SP800-131].

3.1.  Collision Resistance

   The first attack on SHA-1 was published in early 2005 [RIOS2005]. 
   This attack described a theoretical attack on a version of SHA-1
   reduced to 53 rounds.  The very next month [WLY2005] showed
   collisions in the full 80 rounds in 2^69 operations.  Since then,
   many new analysis methods have been developed to improve the attack
   presented in [WLY2005]. However, there are no published results that
   improve upon the results found in [WLY2005]. The IACR ePrint version
   [Man2008/469] of [Man2009] claimed that using the method presented in
   the paper, a collision of full SHA-1 can be found in 2^51 hash

   function calls. However, this claim is absent from the published
   conference paper [Man2009].

   In any case, the known research results indicate that SHA-1 is not as
   collision resistant as expected. The collision security strength is
   significantly less than an ideal hash function (i.e., 2^69 compared
   to 2^80).

3.2.  Pre-image and Second Pre-image Resistance

   There are no known pre-image or second pre-image attacks that are
   specific to the full round SHA-1 algorithm. [KeSch] discovered a
   general result for all narrow pipe Merkle-Damgaard hash functions
   (which includes SHA-1), finding a second pre-image takes less than
   2^n computations. When n = 160 as is the case for SHA-1, it will take
   2^106 computations to find a second pre-image in a 60-byte message.

   In the absence of full round attacks, cryptographers consider
   reduced-round attacks for clues regarding an algorithm's strength. 
   Reduced-round attacks, where the number of reduced rounds is not more
   than a few less than the full rounds, have not been shown to relate
   to full-round attacks. However, the best reduced round attack
   indicates a certain security margin. For example, if the best known
   attack is on 60 out of 80 rounds, then the algorithm has about 20
   rounds to resist improved attacks.  However, the relationship between
   the number of rounds an attack can reach and the number of rounds
   defined in the algorithm is not linear; it does not provide a
   mathematical proof. In other words, reduced round attacks indicate
   how strong the algorithm is with regard to a certain attack, not how
   close it is to being broken. Therefore, the following information
   about reduced-round attacks is included only for completeness.

   The pre-image and second pre-image attacks published on reduced
   versions of SHA-1 (i.e., less than 80 rounds) indicate that SHA-1
   retains a significant security margin against these attacks.
   [AOSA2009] showed a pre-image attack on 48 out of 80 rounds with
   complexity of 2^159.

3.3.  HMAC-SHA-1

   As of today, there is no indication that attacks on SHA-1 can be
   extended to HMAC-SHA-1.

4.  Guidance

   SHA-1 provides less collision resistance than was originally
   expected, and collision resistance has been shown to affect some (but
   not all) applications that use digital signatures. Designers of IETF
 


Polk, et al.               Expires 2011-07-09                   [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  SHA-0 and SHA-1 Security Considerations       2011-01-10


   protocols that use digital signature algorithms should mandate
   support for a hash algorithm with greater collision resistance than
   that provided by SHA-1. Of course, SHA-0 should continue to not be
   used in any IETF protocol.

   [Note: Protocol designers should review the current state of the art
   to ensure that selected hash algorithms provide sufficient security. 
   At the time of publication, SHA-256 is the most commonly specified
   alternative.  The known (reduced round) attacks on the collision
   resistance of SHA-256 indicate a significant security margin, and the
   longer message digest provides increased strength.]

   Nearly all IETF protocols that use signatures assume existing public
   key infrastructures, and SHA-1 is still used in signatures nearly
   everywhere. Therefore, it is unwise to strictly prohibit the use of
   SHA-1 in signature algorithms. Protocols that permit the use of SHA-1
   based digital signatures as an option should reference this
   specification in the security considerations.

   A protocol designer might want to consider the use of SHA-1 with
   randomized hashing such as is specified in [SP800-107]. Note that
   randomized hashing expands the size of signatures and requires
   protocols to carry material that is not needed today. HMAC-SHA-1
   remains secure and is the preferred keyed-hash algorithm for IETF
   protocol design.

Internet-Draft Additional CMS Revocation Information Choices  Sept 2009 
    

Abstract 

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) allows revocation information 
   to be conveyed as part of the SignedData, EnvelopedData, 
   AuthenticatedData, and AuthEnvelopedData content types.  The 
   preferred format for revocation information is the Certificate 
   Revocation List (CRL), but an extension mechanism supports other 
   revocation information choices.  This document defines two additional 
   revocation information formats for Online Certificate Status Protocol 
   (OCSP) responses and Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol 
   (SCVP). 

1. Introduction 

   The RevocationInfoChoices type defined in [CMS] provides a set of 
   revocation status information alternatives, which allows revocation 
   information to be conveyed as part of the SignedData, EnvelopedData, 
   AuthenticatedData, and AuthEnvelopedData content types.  The intent 
   is to provide information sufficient to determine whether the 
   certificates and attribute certificates carried elsewhere in the CMS 
   protecting content are revoked.  However, there MAY be more 
   revocation status information than necessary or there MAY be less 
   revocation status information than necessary. 

   X.509 Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) [PROFILE] are the primary 
   source of revocation status information, but any other revocation 
   information formats can be supported.  This document specifies two 
   other formats: Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses 
   [OCSP] and Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) 
   responses [SCVP]. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [WORDS]. 

2. Revocation Information 

   For simplicity, the ASN.1 definition of the RevocationInfoChoices 
   type from [CMS] is repeated here: 

   RevocationInfoChoices ::= SET OF RevocationInfoChoice 

     RevocationInfoChoice ::= CHOICE { 
     crl        CertificateList, 
     other  [1] IMPLICIT OtherRevocationInfoFormat }

   OtherRevocationInfoFormat ::= SEQUENCE { 
     otherRevInfoFormat  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
     otherRevInfo        ANY DEFINED BY otherRevInfoFormat } 

   The other CHOICE MUST be used to convey OCSP responses and SCVP 
   responses. 

   The revocation information choices are defiend under the following 
   object identifier arc: 

   id-ri OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3) 
     dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) ri(16) } 

3. OCSP Response 

   To carry an OCSP response, the otherRevInfoFormat is set to  
   id-ri-ocsp-response, which has the following ASN.1 definition: 

   id-ri-ocsp-response OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ri 2 } 

   In this case, otherRevInfo MUST carry the OCSP response using the 
   OCSPResponse type defined in [OCSP]. 

4. SCVP Response 

   SCVP supports protected responses and unprotected responses.  This 
   section addresses revocation information formats for each response 
   type. 

4.1. Protected Responses 

   SCVP allows responses to be protected via digital signatures or 
   message authentication codes.  The mechanism to attach either a 
   digital signature or message authentication code involves 
   encapsulating the SCVP response in a SignedData, for digitial 
   signatures, or an AuthenticatedData, for message authentication 
   codes.  This section describes revocation information formats for 
   both. 

4.1.1. Signed SCVP Response 

   To carry a signed SCVP response, the otherRevInfoFormat is set to  
   id-ri-signed-scvp-response, which has the following ASN.1 definition: 

   id-ri-signed-scvp-response OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ri TBD }

Internet-Draft Additional CMS Revocation Information Choices  Sept 2009 
    

   In this case, otherRevInfo MUST carry the signed SCVP response, 
   including the SignedData wrapper.  That is, the SignedData 
   EncapsulatedContentInfo eContentType MUST be  
   id-ct-scvp-certValResponse and eContent MUST contain the CVResponse 
   defined in [SCVP]. 

4.1.2. Authenticated SCVP Response 

   To carry an authenticated SCVP response, the otherRevInfoFormat is 
   set to id-ri-auth-scvp-response, which has the following ASN.1 
   definition: 

   id-ri-auth-scvp-response OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ri TBD } 

   In this case, otherRevInfo MUST carry the authenticated SCVP 
   response, including the AuthenticatedData wrapper.  That is, the 
   AuthenticatedData EncapsulatedContentInfo eContentType MUST be  
   id-ct-scvp-certValResponse and eContent MUST contain the CVResponse 
   defined in [SCVP]. 

4.2. Unprotected SCVP Responses 

   To carry an unprotected SCVP response, the otherRevInfoFormat is set 
   to id-ri-unprotected-scvp-response, which has the following ASN.1 
   definition [SCVP]: 

   id-ri-unprotected-scvp-response OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ri TBD } 

   In this case, otherRevInfo MUST carry the unprotected SCVP response 
   using the CVResponse type defined in [SCVP]. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations of [CMS], [CMS-ASN], [OCSP], [SCVP], and 
   [PROFILE-ASN] apply. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document makes use of object identifiers.  These object 
   identifiers are defined in an arc delegated by IANA to the PKIX 
   Working Group.  No further action by IANA is necessary for this 
   document or any anticipated updates.

Appendix A. ASN.1 Modules 

   Appendix A.1 provides the normative ASN.1 definitions for the 
   structures described in this specification using ASN.1 as defined in 
   [X.680] for compilers that support the 1988 ASN.1. 

   Appendix A.2 provides informative ASN.1 definitions for the 
   structures described in this specification using ASN.1 as defined in 
   [X.680], [X.681], [X.682], and [X.683] for compilers that support the 
   2002 ASN.1. This appendix contains the same information as Appendix 
   A.1 in a more recent (and precise) ASN.1 notation, however Appendix 
   A.1 takes precedence in case of conflict.

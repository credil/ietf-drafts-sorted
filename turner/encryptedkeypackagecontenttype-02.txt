Abstract 

   This document defines the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) 
   encrypted key package content type, which can be used to encrypt a 
   content that includes a key package, such as a symmetric key package 
   or an asymmetric key package.  It is transport independent. CMS can 
   be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or further encrypt 
   this content type.  It is designed to be used with the CMS Content 
   Constraints (CCC) extension, which does not constrain the 
   EncryptedData, EnvelopedData, and AuthEnvelopedData.

1. Introduction 

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) specification [RFC5652] 
   defines mechanisms to digitally sign, digest, authenticate or encrypt 
   arbitrary message content.  Many specifications define content types 
   intended for use with CMS.  [RFCTBD1] and [RFCTBD2] define symmetric 
   key package and asymmetric key package content types that can be 
   signed or encrypted using CMS.  CMS allows composition of complex 
   messages with an arbitrary number of layers.  CMS has been augmented 
   by several specifications ([RFC3274], [RFC4073] and [RFC5083]) that 
   define additional mechanisms to enable creation of messages of 
   arbitrary depth and breadth using a variety of authentication, 
   encryption and compression techniques. 

   The CMS Content Constraints (CCC) certificate extension [CCC] defines 
   an authorization mechanism that allows recipients to determine 
   whether the originator of an authenticated CMS content type is 
   authorized to produce messages of that type.  CCC is used to 
   authorize CMS-protected content.  CCC cannot be used to constrain the 
   following structures that are used to provide layers of protection: 
   SignedData, EnvelopedData, EncryptedData, DigestData, CompressedData, 
   AuthenticatedData, ContentCollection, ContentWithAttributes or 
   AuthEnvelopedData. 

   Using the existing CMS mechanisms, producers of authenticated 
   plaintext key packages can be authorized by including a CCC extension 
   containing the appropriate content type in the producer's 
   certificate.  However, these mechanisms cannot be used to authorize 
   the producers of encrypted key material.  In some key management 
   systems, encrypted key packages are exchanged between entities that 
   cannot decrypt the key package.  The encrypted key package itself may 
   be authenticated and passed to another entity.  In these cases,

Internet-Draft   CMS Encrypted Key Package Content Type        May 2010 
    

   checking the authorization of the producer of the encrypted key 
   package may be desired at the intermediate points. 

   This document defines the encrypted key package content type, which 
   can be used to encrypt a content that includes a key package, such as 
   a symmetric key package [RFCTBD1] or an asymmetric key package 
   [RFCTBD2].  It is transport independent.  The Cryptographic Message 
   Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] can be used to digitally sign, digest, 
   authenticate, or further encrypt this content type. 

   The encrypted key package content type is designed for use with 
   [CCC].  To authorize an originator's public key to originate an 
   encrypted key package, the object identifier associated with the 
   encrypted key package content type is included in the originator's 
   public key certificate CCC certificate extension. For CCC to 
   function, originators encapsulate the encrypted key package in a 
   SignedData, EnvelopedData, or AuthEnvelopedData, and then during 
   certificate path validation the recipient determines whether the 
   originator is authorized to originate the encrypted key package. 

   In [CCC] terminology, the encrypted key package is a leaf node.  
   Additional authorization checks may be required once the key package 
   is decrypted.  For example, the key package shown below consists of a 
   SignedData layer that encapsulates an encrypted key package that 
   encapsulates a SignedData layer containing a symmetric key package.  
   A recipient capable of decrypting the key package would perform the 
   following steps prior to accepting the encapsulated symmetric key 
   material: 

    o Verify the signature on the outer SignedData layer per [RFC5652]. 

    o Build and validate a certification path of the outer signer and 
      confirm the outer signer is authorized to produce the encrypted 
      key package per [RFC5280] and [CCC]. 

    o Decrypt the encrypted key package 

    o Verify the signature on the inner SignedData layer per [RFC5652]. 

    o Build and validate a certification path to the signer of the 
      inner SignedData and confirm the inner signer is authorized to 
      produce the symmetric key package per [RFC5280] and [CCC]. 
      As specified in [CCC], the validator may use the attributes and 
      public keys returned from the second step as inputs for this CMS 
      content constraints processing. 

    o Use the symmetric key material.

   In the example, authorization of the SymmetricKeyPackage originator 
   need not require an intermediate SignedData layer.  For example, if 
   the AuthEnvelopedData option within an EncryptedKeyPackage were used, 
   the second authorization check would be performed beginning with the 
   authEnveloped field. 

   This document also defines an unprotected attribute, Content 
   Decryption Key Identifier, for use with EncryptedData. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

1.2. ASN.1 Syntax Notation 

   The key package is defined using the ASN.1 [X.680], [X.681], [X.682], 
   and [X.683]. 

2. Encrypted Key Package 

   The encrypted key package content type is used to encrypt a content 
   that includes a key package.  This content type is usually used to 
   provide encryption of a key package or a signed key package.  This 
   content type makes use of the CMS EncryptedData content type

Internet-Draft   CMS Encrypted Key Package Content Type        May 2010 
    

   [RFC5652], the CMS EnvelopedData content type [RFC5652], or the CMS 
   AuthEnvelopedData content type [RFC5083] depending on the fields that 
   are needed for key management.  The difference between the encrypted 
   key package content type and these three protecting content types is 
   the object identifier and one tag; otherwise, the encrypted key 
   package content type is the same as the selected protecting content 
   type, which is either EncryptedData, EnvelopedData, or 
   AuthEnvelopedData. 

   The encrypted key package content type has the following syntax: 

     ct-encrypted-key-package CONTENT-TYPE ::= 
       { EncryptedKeyPackage IDENTIFIED BY id-ct-KP-encryptedKeyPkg } 

     id-ct-KP-encryptedKeyPkg OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  
       { joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) 
         gov(101) dod(2) infosec(1) formats(2) 
         key-package-content-types(78) 2 } 

     EncryptedKeyPackage ::= CHOICE { 
       encrypted        EncryptedData, 
       enveloped        [0] EnvelopedData, 
       authEnveloped    [1] AuthEnvelopedData } 

   The EncryptedData structure is used for simple symmetric encryption, 
   where the sender and the receiver already share the necessary 
   encryption key.  The EncryptedData structure carries an encryption 
   algorithm identifier, and an unprotected attribute can be used to 
   carry an encryption key identifier if one is needed (see Section 3).  
   See [RFC5652] for further discussion of the EncryptedData fields. 

   The EnvelopedData structure is used for encryption, where transferred 
   key management information enables decryption by the receiver.  
   Encryption details depend on the key management algorithm used. In 
   addition to the key management information, the EnvelopedData 
   structure carries an encryption algorithm identifier.  See [RFC5652] 
   for further discussion of the EnvelopedData fields. 

   The AuthEnvelopedData structure is used for authenticated encryption, 
   and it includes key management information in a manner similar to 
   EnvelopedData.  Encryption details depend on the key management 
   algorithm used. In addition to the key management information, the 
   AuthEnvelopedData structure carries a message authentication code 
   that covers the content as well as authenticated attributes.  See 
   [RFC5083] for further discussion of the AuthEnvelopedData fields.

   Implementations of this document MUST support the EnvelopedData 
   choice, SHOULD support the EncryptedData choice, and MAY support the 
   AuthEnvelopedData. 

   Implementations that support EnvelopedData and EncryptedData to 
   encapsulate with this content type MUST support an 
   EncryptedKeyPackage that encapsulates either a SignedData [RFC5652] 
   that further encapsulates a SymmetricKeyPackage [RFCTBD1] or a 
   SignedData that further encapsulates an AsymmetricKeyPackage 
   [RFCTBD2]. Implementations that support AuthEnvelopedData to 
   encapsulate with this content type MUST support an 
   EncryptedKeyPackage that encapsulates either a SymmetricKeyPackage 
   [RFCTBD1] or an AsymmetricKeyPackage [RFCTBD2].  It is OPTIONAL for 
   implementations that support AuthEnvelopedData to encapsulate with 
   this content type to support an EncryptedKeyPackage that encapsulates 
   either a SignedData [RFC5652] that further encapsulates a 
   SymmetricKeyPackage [RFCTBD1] or a SignedData that further 
   encapsulates an AsymmetricKeyPackage [RFCTBD2].  Likewise, 
   implementations that process this content type to decrypt the 
   encapsulated data MUST support an EncryptedKeyPackage that 
   encapsulates either a SignedData that further encapsulates a 
   SymmetricKeyPackage or a SignedData that further encapsulates an 
   AsymmetricKeyPackage.  An EncryptedKeyPackage content type MUST 
   contain at least one SymmetricKeyPackage or AsymmetricKeyPackage. 
   Implementations MAY support additional encapsulating layers. 

   Note that interoperability between an originator and a recipient that 
   do not support the same inner-most content (e.g., originator supports 
   AsymmetricKeyPackage while recipient supports SymmetricKeyPackage) is 
   not a concern as originators should be aware of the recipient's 
   capabilities; however, the mechanism for the exchange of the 
   recipient's capabilities is beyond the scope of this document. 

3. Content Decryption Key Identifier 

   The content-decryption-key-identifier attribute can be used to 
   identify the symmetric keying material that is needed for decryption 
   of the EncryptedData content if there is any ambiguity.  The 
   ATTRIBUTE definition is taken from [RFCTBD3]. There MUST be only one 
   instance of the content-decryption-key-identifier attribute and there 
   MUST be only one value for the content-decryption-key-identifier 
   attribute.

Internet-Draft   CMS Encrypted Key Package Content Type        May 2010 
    

   The content-decryption-key-identifier attribute has the following 
   syntax: 

     aa-content-decrypt-key-identifier ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
       TYPE          ContentDecryptKeyID 
       IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-KP-contentDecryptKeyID } 

     id-aa-KP-contentDecryptKeyID OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
       joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
       dod(2) infosec(1) attributes(5) 66 } 

     ContentDecryptKeyID ::= OCTET STRING 

   The content decryption key identifier contains an octet string, and 
   this syntax does not impose any particular structure on the 
   identifier value. 

   Due to multiple layers of encryption, the content-decryption-key-
   identifier attribute can appear in more than one location in the 
   overall key package.  When there are multiple occurrences of the 
   content-decryption-key-identifier attribute, each occurrence is 
   evaluated independently.  Each one is used to identify the needed 
   keying material for that layer of encryption. 

4. Security Considerations 

   Implementers of this protocol are strongly encouraged to consider 
   generally accepted principles of secure key management when 
   integrating this capability within an overall security architecture. 

   The security considerations from [RFC5083], [RFC5652], [RFCTBD1], 
   [RFCTBD2], [RFCTBD3], and [RFCTBD4] apply.  If the CCC extension is 
   used as an authorization mechanism, then the security considerations 
   from [CCC] also apply. 

   The encrypted key package content type might not provide proof of 
   origin if the content encryption algorithm does not support 
   authenticated key exchange.  To provide proof of origin for this 
   content, another security protocol needs to be used.  This is the 
   reason that support for encapsulating the SymmetricKeyPackage and 
   AsymmetricKeypackage with a SignedData content type from [RFC5652] is 
   required for the EnvelopedData and EncryptedData choices. 

   When this content type is used the CMS SignedData [RFC5652] 
   validation rules MUST be used.  The PKCS #7 [RFC2315] validation 
   rules MUST NOT be used.

   content type, a CMS attribute, and the ASN.1 module; all found in 
   Appendix A.  All OIDs are registered in an arc delegated by IANA to 
   the SMIME Working Group.  No further action by IANA is necessary for

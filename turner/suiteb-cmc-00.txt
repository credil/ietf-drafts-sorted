Internet-Draft           Suite B CMC Profile              December 2009 
    

Abstract 

   The United States Government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite 
   B Cryptography", which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for 
   national security applications.  This document specifies a profile of 
   the Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) protocol for managing Suite 
   B X.509 public key certificates.  This profile is a refinement of 
   RFC5272, RFC5273, and RFC5274. 

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies a profile for using the Certificate 
   Management over CMS (CMC) protocol, defined in [RFC5272], [RFC5273], 
   and [RFC5274], to manage X.509 public key certificates compliant with 
   the United States National Security Agency's Suite B Cryptography as 
   defined in the Suite B Certificate and Certificate Revocation List 
   (CRL) Profile [SBCERT].  This document specifically focuses on 
   defining CMC interactions for both initial enrollment and rekey of 
   Suite B public key certificates between a client and a Certification 
   Authority (CA).  One or more Registration Authorities (RAs) may act 
   as intermediaries between the client and the CA.  This profile may be 
   further tailored by specific communities to meet their needs.  
   Specific communities will also define Certificate Policies that 
   implementations must comply with. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

   The terminology in [RFC5272] Section 2.1 applies to this profile. 

3. Requirements and Assumptions 

   All key pairs are on either the curve P-256 or the curve P-384.  FIPS 
   186-3 [FIPS1863] or NIST Special Publication 800-56A [SP80056A] 
   provides useful guidance for elliptic curve key pair generation. 

   This document assumes that the required trust anchors have been 
   securely provisioned to the client and, when applicable, any RAs.   

   All requirements in [RFC5272], [RFC5273], and [RFC5274] apply, except 
   where overridden by this profile. 

   This profile was developed with the scenarios described in Appendix A 
   in mind.  However, use of this profile is not limited to just those 
   scenarios.

Internet-Draft           Suite B CMC Profile              December 2009 
    

   The term "client" in this profile typically refers to an End-Entity 
   (EE).  However, it may instead refer to a third party acting on the 
   End-Entity's behalf.  The client may or may not be the entity that 
   actually generates the key pair, but it does perform the CMC protocol 
   interactions with the RA and/or CA.  For example, the client may be a 
   token management system that communicates with a cryptographic token 
   through an out-of-band secure protocol. 

   This profile may be used to manage RA or CA certificates.  In that 
   case, the RA or CA whose certificate is being managed is considered 
   to be the End-Entity. 

4. Client Requirements: Generating PKI Requests  

   This section specifies the conventions employed when a client 
   requests a certificate from a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). 

   The Full PKI Request MUST be used and it MUST be encapsulated in a 
   SignedData, as per [RFC5008].  The PKIData content type complies with 
   [RFC5272] with the following additional guidance: 

     o controlSequence MUST be present.  It MUST include the following 
       CMC controls: Transaction ID and Sender Nonce.  Other CMC 
       controls MAY be included. 

       o If the request is being authenticated using a shared secret, 
          then the following guidance in this paragraph applies:  
          Identity Proof Version 2 control MUST be included.  hashAlgId 
          MUST be id-sha256 for P-256 certificate requests, and MUST be 
          id-sha384 for P-384 certificate requests, as per [SHA2].  
          macAlgId MUST be HMAC-SHA256 for P-256 certificate requests, 
          and MUST be HMAC-SHA384 for P-384 certificate requests, as per 
          [RFC4231].  If the subject included in the certificate request 
          is NULL or otherwise does not uniquely identify the End-
          Entity, then the POP Link Random control MUST be included to 
          prevent substitution attacks, and the POP Link Witness Version 
          2 control MUST be included in the inner PKCS #10 or CRMF 
          request as described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. 

     o reqSequence MUST be present.  It MUST include at least one tcr 
       (see Section 4.1) or crm (see Section 4.2) TaggedRequest.  
       Support for the orm choice is OPTIONAL. 

   If the Full PKI Request contains a P-256 public key, then the 
   SignedData encapsulating the Full PKI Request MUST be generated using 
   either SHA-256 and ECDSA with P-256, or using SHA-384 and ECDSA with 
   P-384, as per [RFC5008].  If the Full PKI Request contains a P-384 
   public key, then the SignedData MUST be generated using SHA-384 and 
   ECDSA with P-384, as per [RFC5008].

Internet-Draft           Suite B CMC Profile              December 2009 
    

   The Full PKI Request SHOULD be signed using the private key that 
   corresponds to the subject public key of an existing signature 
   certificate.  However, during initial enrollment, an appropriate 
   signature certificate may not yet exist.  If the Full PKI Request 
   includes one or more signature certificate requests, then for initial 
   enrollment authenticated using a shared secret when no appropriate 
   certificate yet exists, the Full PKI Request MAY instead be signed 
   using the private key corresponding to the subject public key of one 
   of the requested signature certificates.  The Full PKI Request MUST 
   NOT ever be signed using a key pair intended for use in a key 
   establishment certificate. 

 4.1. Tagged Certificate Request 

   The reqSequence tcr choice conveys PKCS #10 [RFC2986] syntax.  The 
   CertificateRequest MUST comply with [RFC5272] Section 3.2.1.2.1 with 
   the following additional guidance: 

     o subjectPublicKeyInfo MUST be set as defined in 4.4 of [SBCERT]; 

     o attributes MUST include one ExtensionReq attribute.  The Key 
       Usage extension MUST be included and it MUST be set as per 
       [SBCERT].  For rekey, if the subject is NULL, then the 
       SubjectAltName extension MUST be included and set equal to the 
       SubjectAltName of the certificate being rekeyed.  Other 
       extension requests MAY be included as desired. 

       o For non-rekey requests, if the Full PKI Request encapsulating 
          this Tagged Certificate Request is being signed by a key for 
          which a certificate currently exists, and the Subject in the 
          certificate request is NULL or otherwise does not uniquely 
          identify the End-Entity, then the SigningCertificateV2 
          attribute, as defined in [RFC5035], SHOULD also be included in 
          the attributes field.  Support for the policies field is 
          optional.  The ESSCertIDV2 hashAlgorithm field MUST be set to 
          id-sha256 for P-256 certificate requests and id-sha384 for P-
          384 certificate requests.  Presence of this attribute protects 
          against substitution attacks. 

       o If the request is being authenticated using a shared secret, 
          and the Subject in the certificate request is NULL or 
          otherwise does not uniquely identify the End-Entity, then the 
          POP Link Witness Version 2 control MUST be included in the 
          attributes field.  keyGenAlgorithm MUST be id-sha256 for P-256 
          certificate requests and MUST be id-sha384 for P-384 
          certificate requests.  macAlgorithm MUST be HMAC-SHA256 for P-
          256 certificate requests, and MUST be HMAC-SHA384 for P-384 
          certificate requests.  Presence of this attribute protects 
          against substitution attacks.

     o signatureAlgorithm MUST be ecdsa-with-sha256 for P-256 
       certificate requests, and MUST be ecdsa-with-sha384 for P-384 
       certificate requests; 

     o signature MUST be generated using the private key corresponding 
       to the public key in the CertificationRequestInfo, for both 
       signature and key establishment certificate requests.  The 
       signature provides proof of possession of the private key to the 
       Certification Authority. 

 4.2. Certificate Request Message 

   The reqSequence crm choice conveys Certificate Request Message Format 
   (CRMF) [RFC4211] syntax.  The CertReqMsg MUST comply with [RFC5272] 
   Section 3.2.1.2.2 with the following additional guidance: 

     o popo MUST be included using the signature (POPOSigningKey) Proof 
       of Possession choice and set as defined in [RFC4211] section 4.1 
       for both signature and key establishment certification requests.  
       The POPOSigningKey poposkInput field MUST be omitted.  The 
       POPOSigningKey algorithmIdentifier MUST be ecdsa-with-sha256 for 
       P-256 certificate requests, and MUST be ecdsa-with-sha384 for P-
       384 certificate requests.  The signature MUST be generated using 
       the private key corresponding to the public key in the 
       CertTemplate. 

   The CertTemplate MUST comply with [RFC5272] Section 3.2.1.2.2 with 
   the following additional guidance: 

     o version MAY be included and, if included, it MUST be set to 2 as 
       per paragraph 4.3 of [SBCERT]; 

     o publicKey MUST be set as defined in 4.4 of [SBCERT]; 

     o extensions MUST include at least the Key Usage extension and it 
       MUST be set as per [SBCERT].  For rekey, if the subject is NULL, 
       then the SubjectAltName extension MUST be included and set equal 
       to the SubjectAltName of the certificate being rekeyed.  Other 
       extension requests MAY be included as desired. 

   For non-rekey requests, if the Full PKI Request encapsulating this 
   Certificate Request Message is being signed by a key for which a 
   certificate currently exists, and the Subject in the certificate 
   request is NULL or otherwise does not uniquely identify the End-
   Entity, then the SigningCertificateV2 attribute, as defined in 
   [RFC5035], SHOULD be included in the controls field.  Support for the 
   policies field is optional.  The ESSCertIDV2 hashAlgorithm field MUST 
   be set to id-sha256 for P-256 certificate requests and id-sha384 for

   P-384 certificate requests.  Presence of this attribute protects 
   against substitution attacks. 

   If the request is being authenticated using a shared secret, and the 
   Subject in the certificate request is NULL or otherwise does not 
   uniquely identify the End-Entity, then the POP Link Witness Version 2 
   control MUST be included in the controls field.  keyGenAlgorithm MUST 
   be id-sha256 for P-256 certificate requests and MUST be id-sha384 for 
   P-384 certificate requests.  macAlgorithm MUST be HMAC-SHA256 for P-
   256 certificate requests and MUST be HMAC-SHA384 for P-384 
   certificate requests.  Presence of this attribute protects against 
   substitution attacks. 

5. RA Requirements: Processing PKI Requests (Client to CA) 

   This section addresses the optional case where one or more RAs act as 
   intermediaries between the client and CA as described in Section 7 of 
   [RFC5272].  In this section, the term "client" refers to the entity 
   from which the RA received the PKI Request.  This section is only 
   applicable to RAs. 

 5.1. RA Generated PKI Requests 

   If the RA encapsulates the client-generated PKI Request in a new RA-
   signed PKI Request, it will create a Full PKI Request encapsulated in 
   a SignedData.  If the request contains a certification request for a 
   P-256 public key, then the SignedData MUST be generated using either 
   SHA-256 and ECDSA with P-256 or SHA-384 and ECDSA with P-384, as per 
   [RFC5008].  If the request contains a certification request for a P-
   384 public key, then the SignedData MUST be generated using SHA-384 
   and ECDSA with P-384, as per [RFC5008].  The PKIData content type 
   complies with [RFC5272] with the following additional guidance: 

     o controlSequence MUST be present.  It MUST include the following 
       CMC controls: Transaction ID and Sender Nonce.  Other 
       appropriate CMC controls MAY be included. 

     o cmsSequence MUST be present.  It contains the original, 
       unmodified request received from the client. 

6. CA Requirements 

   This section specifies the requirements for CAs that receive PKI 
   Requests and that generate PKI Responses.

Internet-Draft           Suite B CMC Profile              December 2009 
    

 6.1. CA Processing of PKI Requests 

   CAs MUST ensure that only the permitted signature, hash, and MAC 
   algorithms described throughout this profile are used, and otherwise 
   reject the request. 

   For requests involving an RA, the CA MUST verify the RA's 
   authorization.  Only RAs can include the Modify Certification Request 
   control.  The following certificate fields MUST NOT be modifiable 
   using the Modify Certification Request control: version, publicKey, 
   and the key usage extension.  The request MUST be rejected if an 
   attempt to modify those certificate request fields is present.  

   If the client generated PKI Request includes a SigningCertificateV2 
   attribute either in the CertRequest controls field for a CRMF request 
   or in the tcr attributes field for a PKCS#10 request, then the CA 
   SHOULD ensure that the certificate referenced in the attribute 
   corresponds to the private key used to sign the PKI Request.  If the 
   CA performs this check, and the referenced certificate doesn't 
   correspond to the private key used to sign the PKI Request, then the 
   CA MUST reject the PKI Request. 

 6.2. CA Generated PKI Responses 

   The Full PKI Response MUST be used and it MUST be encapsulated in a 
   SignedData, as per [RFC5008].  The PKIResponse content type complies 
   with [RFC5272] with the following additional guidance: 

     o controlSequence MUST be included.  It MUST include the following 
       CMC controls: Extended CMC Status Info, Transaction ID, Sender 
       Nonce, and Recipient Nonce.  Other appropriate CMC controls MAY 
       be included. 

       o If the SigningCertificateV2 check is performed and does not 
          pass, then the Extended CMC Status Info CMCStatus value MUST 
          be set to failed. 

   If the PKI Response is in response to an RA encapsulated PKI Request, 
   then the above PKI Response is encapsulated in another CA generated 
   PKI Response.  That PKI Response MUST be encapsulated in a 
   SignedData, as per [RFC5008].   The above PKI Response is placed in 
   the encapsulating PKI Response cmsSequence field. The other fields 
   are as above.  The following illustrates a successful CA response to 
   an RA encapsulated PKI Request: 

     SignedData (applied by the CA) 
       PKIData 
         controlSequence (Extended CMC Status Info, Transaction ID, 
                          Sender Nonce, Recipient Nonce)

         cmsSequence 
           SignedData (applied by CA and includes returned 
                       certificates) 
             PKIData 
               controlSequence (Extended CMC Status Info, Transaction 
                                ID, Sender Nonce, Recipient Nonce)  

   The same private key used to sign certificates MUST NOT be used to 
   sign Full PKI Response messages.  Instead, a separate certificate 
   authorized to sign CMC responses MUST be used.  Certificates 
   authorized to sign Full PKI Responses SHOULD include the id-kp-cmcCA 
   following Extended Key Usage (EKU): 

     id-kp-cmcCA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TBSL } 

   The certificate authorized to sign Full PKI Responses MAY also 
   include the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Constraints 
   (CCC) certificate extension [CCC].  CCC SHOULD be included if 
   constraints are to be placed on the content types generated. 

   The signature on the SignedData MUST be generated using either ECDSA 
   P-256 with SHA-256 or ECDSA P-384 with SHA-384.  If the Full PKI 
   Response is a successful response to a P-256 public key certificate 
   request, then the SignedData MUST be generated using either SHA-256 
   and ECDSA with P-256 or SHA-384 and ECDSA with P-384, as per 
   [RFC5008].  If the Full PKI Response is a successful response to a P-
   384 public key certificate request, then the SignedData MUST be 
   generated using SHA-384 and ECDSA with P-384, as per [RFC5008].  If 
   the Full PKI Response is an unsuccessful response to a PKI Request, 
   then the SignedData MUST be signed by either SHA-256 and ECDSA with 
   P-256 or SHA-384 and ECDSA with P-384.  If the Full PKI Response is a 
   successful response to a PKI Request that only contained a Get 
   Certificate or Get CRL control, then the SignedData MUST be signed by 
   either SHA-256 and ECDSA with P-256 or SHA-384 and ECDSA with P-384. 

7. Client Requirements: Processing PKI Responses 

   Clients MUST authenticate all PKI Responses. This includes verifying 
   that the PKI Response is signed by a CA whose certificate validates 
   back to a trust anchor and that the CA's certificate either includes 
   the id-kp-cmcCA EKU, includes an appropriate CMS Content Constraints 
   extension, or is determined to be authorized to sign responses 
   through an implementation specific mechanism.  The PKI Response MAY 
   be signed by an RA if it is an error message, or if the PKI Response 
   contains an inner PKI Response signed by a CA.  In that case, each 
   layer of PKI Response must still contain a valid signature signed by 
   an entity with a valid certificate that verifies back to an 
   acceptable trust anchor.

Internet-Draft           Suite B CMC Profile              December 2009 
    

   When a newly issued certificate is included in the PKI Response, the 
   client MUST verify that the newly issued certificate's public key 
   matches the public key that the client requested.  The client MUST 
   also ensure that the certificate's signature is valid and that the 
   signature validates back to an acceptable trust anchor. 

   PKI Responses that do not pass these tests MUST be rejected. 

8. CMC Controls 

   When the Identity Proof V2 control is used, the shared-secret MUST be 
   randomly generated and securely distributed.  The shared-secret MUST 
   provide at least 128 bits of strength for P-256 certificate requests 
   and at least 192 bits of strength for P-384 certificate requests. 

9. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations in [RFC5272], [RFC5273], and [RFC5274] 
   apply. 

   Compliant with NIST Special Publication 800-57 [SP80057], this 
   profile defines proof-of-possession of a key establishment private 
   key by performing a digital signature.  Except for one-time proof-of-
   possession, a single key pair MUST NOT be used for both signature and 
   key establishment. 

   This specification requires implementations to generate key pairs and 
   other random values.  The use of inadequate pseudo-random number 
   generators (PRNGs) can result in little or no security.  The 
   generation of quality random numbers is difficult.  NIST Special 
   Publication 800-90 [SP80090] or FIPS 186 [FIPS1863] may offer 
   guidance. 

   When RAs are used, the list of authorized RAs must be securely 
   distributed out-of-band to CAs. 

10. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.

Appendix A. Scenarios 

   This section illustrates several potential certificate initial 
   enrollment and rekey scenarios supported by this profile.  This 
   section does not intend to place any limits or restrictions on the 
   use of CMC.

 A.1. Initial Enrollment of Signature or CA Certificates 

   This section describes three scenarios for authenticating initial 
   signature or CA certificate enrollment requests: 

     1. Previously installed signature certificate (e.g., Manufacturer 
       Installed Certificate); 

     2. Shared secret distributed securely out-of-band; 

     3. RA authentication. 

 A.1.1. Previously Installed Signature Certificate 

   In this scenario, the EE has had a signature certificate installed by 
   the cryptographic module manufacturer.  As the EE already has a 
   signature certificate, it can be used to authenticate a request for a 
   new certificate.  The EE signs the Full PKI Request with the private 
   key that corresponds to the subject public key of a previously 
   installed signature certificate.  The CA will recognize the 
   authorization of the previously installed certificate and issue an 
   appropriate certificate to the EE.  The Subject in the previously 
   installed certificate and in the newly issued certificate are not 
   required to match. 

 A.1.2. Shared Secret Distributed Securely Out-of-Band 

   In this scenario, the CA distributes a shared secret out-of-band to 
   the EE that the EE uses to authenticate its certificate request.  The 
   EE signs the Full PKI Request with the private key for which the 
   certification is being requested.  The EE includes the Identity Proof 
   Version 2 control to authenticate the request using the shared 
   secret.  The CA uses either the Identification control or the Subject 
   in the EE's enclosed PKCS #10 or CRMF certification request message 
   to identify the request.  The EE performs either the POP Link Witness 
   Version 2 mechanism as described in [RFC5272] section 6.3.1.1 or the 
   Shared-Subject/Subject DN Linking mechanism as described in [RFC5272] 
   section 6.3.2.  The Subject in the enclosed PKCS #10 or CRMF 
   certificate request does not necessarily match the issued 
   certificate, as it may just be used to help identify the request (and 
   corresponding shared secret) to the CA. 

 A.1.3. RA Authentication 

   In this scenario, the EE does not automatically authenticate its 
   enrollment request to the CA, either because the EE has nothing to 
   authenticate the request with, or because organizational policy 
   requires RA involvement.  The EE creates a Full PKI Request and sends 
   it to an RA.  The RA verifies the authenticity of the request, then,

   if approved, encapsulates and signs the request as described in 
   Section 5.2, forwarding the new request on to the CA.  The Subject in 
   the PKCS #10 or CRMF certification request is not required to match 
   the issued certificate, it may just be used to help identify the 
   request to the RA and/or CA. 

 A.2. Initial Enrollment of Key Establishment Certificates 

   This scenario addresses the initial enrollment of End-Entity Key 
   Establishment Certificates.  This scenario requires that the End-
   Entity holds a private key corresponding to either a previously 
   installed signature certificate (see Section A.1.1) or End-Entity 
   signature certificate.  The private key corresponding to the existing 
   certificate is used to sign the Full PKI Request for the Key 
   Establishment Certificate. 

 A.3. Rekey 

   There are two scenarios to support the rekey of certificates that are 
   already enrolled.  One addresses the rekey of signature certificates 
   and the other addresses the rekey of key establishment certificates.  
   Typically, organizational policy will require certificates to be 
   currently valid to be rekeyed, and may require initial enrollment to 
   be repeated when rekey is not possible. 

 A.3.1. Rekey of Signature Certificates 

   When a signature certificate is rekeyed, the PKCS #10 or CRMF 
   certification request message enclosed in the Full PKI Request will 
   include the same Subject as the current signature certificate.  The 
   Full PKI Request will be signed by the current private key 
   corresponding to the current signature certificate.  

 A.3.2. Rekey of Key Establishment Certificates 

   Rekey of a key establishment certificate is handled equivalently to 
   its initial enrollment as described in Section A.2.

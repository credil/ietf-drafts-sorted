Internet-Draft   Elliptic Curve Private Key Structure     February 2009

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies a syntax and semantics for Elliptic Curve 
   (EC) private key information.  EC private key information includes a 
   private key and parameters.  Additionally, it may include the 
   corresponding public key.  The syntax and semantics defined herein 
   are based on a similar syntax and semantics defined in Standards for 
   Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG) [SECG1]. 

   Most Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) mandate local key generation; 
   however, there are some PKIs that also support centralized key 
   generation (e.g., the public-private key pair is generated by a CA).  
   The structure defined in this document allows the entity that 
   generates the private and public keys to distribute the key pair and 
   the associated domain parameters. 

   A scenario in which this syntax is useful distributes EC private keys 
   using PrivateKeyInfo, as defined in PKCS #8 [RFC5208]. Distributing 
   an EC private key with PKCS#8 [RFC5208] involves including: 
   a) id-ecPublicKey, id-ecDH, or id-ecMQV (from [RFC5480]) with the 
   namedCurve as the parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm field 
   b) ECPrivateKey in the PrivateKey field, which is an OCTET STRING. 
   When a public key is included, the publicKey field in ECPrivateKey is 
   used. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Elliptic Curve Private Key Format 

   This section gives the syntax for an EC private key.  Computationally 
   an EC private key is an unsigned integer, but for representation, EC 
   private key information SHALL have ASN.1 type ECPrivateKey: 

   ECPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE { 
     version        INTEGER { ecPrivkeyVer1(1) } (ecPrivkeyVer1), 
     privateKey     OCTET STRING, 
     parameters [0] ECParameters {{ NamedCurve }} OPTIONAL, 
     publicKey  [1] BIT STRING OPTIONAL 
   }

Internet-Draft   Elliptic Curve Private Key Structure     February 2009 
    

    The fields of type ECPrivateKey have the following meanings:  

    o version specifies the syntax version number of the elliptic curve 
     private key structure. For this version of the document, it SHALL 
     be set to ecPrivkeyVer1, which is of type INTEGER and whose value 
     is one (1). 

    o privateKey is the private key.  It is an octet string of length 
     ceiling (log2(n/8)) (where n is the order of the curve) obtained 
     from the unsigned integer via the Integer-to-Octet-String-
     Primitive (I2OSP) defined in [RFC3447]. 

    o parameters specifies the elliptic curve domain parameters 
     associated to the private key. The type ECParameters are discussed 
     in [RFC5480]. As specified in [RFC5480], only the namedCurve 
     CHOICE is permitted. namedCurve is an object identifier that fully 
     identifies the required values for a particular set of elliptic 
     curve domain parameters. Though the ASN.1 indicates that the 
     parameters field is OPTIONAL, implementations that conform to this 
     document MUST always include the parameters field. 

    o publicKey contains the elliptic curve public key associated with 
     the private key in question. The format of the public key is 
     specified in Section 2.2 of [RFC5480]. Though the ASN.1 indicates 
     publicKey is OPTIONAL, implementations that conform to this 
     document SHOULD always include the publicKey field. The publicKey 
     field can be omitted when the public key has been distributed via 
     another mechanism, which is beyond the scope of this document.  
     Given the private key and the parameters the public key can always 
     be recomputed; this field exists as a convenience to the consumer. 

4. Other Considerations 

   When generating a transfer encoding, generators SHOULD use DER 
   [X.690] and receivers SHOULD be prepared to handle BER [X.690] and 
   DER [X.690]. 

   Section 1 described a format for transporting EC private keys (i.e., 
   converting ECPrivateKey to PrivateKeyInfo [PKCS#8]); however, this 
   format can also be used for local storage. 

   Local storage of an unencrypted ECPrivateKey object is out of scope 
   of this document.  However, one popular format uses the .pem file 
   extension.  It is a PEM encoding, which is the Base64 encoding 
   [RFC4648], of the DER encoded ECPrivateKey object sandwiched between: 

   -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- 
   -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

Internet-Draft   Elliptic Curve Private Key Structure     February 2009 
    

   Another local storage format uses the .der file extension.  In this 
   case, it is a DER [X.690] encoding of the ECPrivateKey object. 

   Local storage of an encrypted ECPrivateKey object is out of scope of 
   this document.  However, ECPrivateKey should be the format for the 
   plaintext key being encrypted.  DER [X.690] encoding ECPrivateKey 
   will promote interoperability if the key is encrypted for transport 
   to another party.  PEM encoding the DER encoded ECPrivateKey is 
   common; "Proc-Type:" and "DEK-INFO:" fields [RFC1421] followed by the 
   DER Encoded ECPrivateKey are sandwiched between: 

   -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- 
   -----END EC PRIVATE KEY----- 

5. Security Considerations 

   This structure does not protect the EC private key information in any 
   way.  This structure should be combined with a security protocol to 
   protect it.  

   Protection of the private-key information is vital to public-key 
   cryptography. The consequences of disclosure depends on the purpose 
   of the private key. If a private key is used for signature, then the 
   disclosure allows unauthorized signing. If a private key is used for 
   key management, then disclosure allows unauthorized parties to access 
   the managed keying material.  The encryption algorithm used in the 
   encryption process must be as 'strong' as the key it is protecting. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.

 Appendix A ASN.1 Module 

   This appendix provides ASN.1 definitions for the structures described 
   in this specification using ASN.1 as defined in [X.680], [X.681], 
   [X.682], and [X.683] for compilers that support the 2002 ASN.1.  

   ECPrivateKey { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)

     id-mod-ecprivateKey(65) }

Appendix B Differences with SECG1 

   This appendix lists the differences between this document and 
   [SECG1]: 

   1. This document uses the I2OSP routine defined in [RFC3447] while 
   SECG1 defines its own routine.  The two routines result in the same 
   output. 

   2. SECG1 constrains its parameters (i.e., the curves) to 
   SECGCurveNames.  This document constrains the parameters to 
   NamedCurve from [RFC5480].

   3. This document requires parameters be present while SECG1 does not. 

   4. This document specifies requirements for encoding rules while 
   SECG1 did not.

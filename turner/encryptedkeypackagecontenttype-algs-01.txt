1. Introduction 

   This document describes the conventions for using several 
   cryptographic algorithms with the encrypted key package content type 
   [RFCTBD].  Specifically, it includes conventions necessary to 
   implement EnvelopedData [RFC5652], EncryptedData [RFC5652], and 
   AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083]. 

   This document does not define any new algorithms; instead it refers 
   to previously defined algorithms.  

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. EnvelopedData 

   EnvelopedData supports a number of key management techniques.  
   Implementations that claim conformance to this document MUST support 
   the key transport mechanisms and SHOULD support the key agreement 
   mechanisms.  Other techniques MAY be supported. 

   When key transport is used, RSA encryption [RFC3370] MUST be 
   supported and RSA-OAEP [RFC3560] SHOULD be supported. 

   When key agreement is used, Diffie-Hellman ephemeral-static [RFC3370] 
   SHOULD be supported. 

   Regardless of the key management technique choice, implementations 
   MUST support AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].  
   Implementations SHOULD support AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding 
   [RFC5649]. 

   When key agreement is used, a key wrap algorithm is also specified to 
   wrap the content encryption key.  If the content encryption algorithm 
   is AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding, then the key wrap algorithm MUST be 
   AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].  If the content encryption

   algorithm is AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding, then the key wrap 
   algorithm MUST be AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649]. 

3. EncryptedData 

   EncryptedData requires that keys be managed by means other than 
   EncryptedData; therefore, the only algorithm specified is the content 
   encryption algorithm. Implementations MUST support AES-128 Key Wrap 
   with Padding [RFC5649].  Implementations SHOULD support AES-256 Key 
   Wrap with Padding [RFC5649]. 

4. AuthEnvelopedData 

   AuthEnvelopedData, like EnvelopedData, supports a number of key 
   management techniques.  The key management requirements for 
   AuthEnvelopedData are the same as EnvelopedData.  The difference is 
   the content encryption algorithm.  Implementations MUST support 128-
   bit AES-GCM [RFC5084] and SHOULD support 256-bit AES-GCM [RFC5084].  
   Implementations MAY also support for AES-CCM [RFC5084]. 

5. Public Key Sizes 

   The easiest way to implement the key transport requirement for 
   EnvelopedData and AuthenticatedData is with public key certificates 
   [RFC5280]. If an implementation supports RSA, RSASSA-PSS, DSA, RSAES-
   OAEP, or DH, then it MUST support key lengths from 1024-bit to 2048-
   bit, inclusive. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations from [RFC3370], [RFC3394], [RFC3560], 
   [RFC5083], [RFC5084], [RFC5649], [RFC5652], and [RFCTBD] apply. 

   The choice of content encryption algorithms for this document was 
   based on [RFC5649]: "In the design of some high assurance 
   cryptographic modules, it is desirable to segregate cryptographic 
   keying material from other data. The use of a specific cryptographic 
   mechanism solely for the protection of cryptographic keying material 
   can assist in this goal." Unfortunately, there is no AES-CCM or AES-
   GCM mode that provides the same properties.  If an AES-CCM and AES-
   GCM mode that provides the same properties is defined, then this 
   document will be updated to adopt that algorithm. 

   [SP800-57] provides comparable bits of security for some algorithms 
   and key sizes. [SP800-57] also provides time frames during which 
   certain numbers of bits of security are appropriate and some 
   environments may find these time frames useful.

Internet-Draft   Elliptic Curve Private Key Structure      October 2009 
    

Abstract 

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics for conveying 
   Elliptic Curve (EC) private key information.  This syntax and 
   semantics defined herein are based on a similar syntax and semantics 
   defined in Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG).  

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies a syntax and semantics for Elliptic Curve 
   (EC) private key information.  EC private key information includes a 
   private key and parameters.  Additionally, it may include the 
   corresponding public key.  The syntax and semantics defined herein 
   are based on a similar syntax and semantics defined in Standards for 
   Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG) [SECG1]. 

   Most Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) mandate local key generation; 
   however, there are some PKIs that also support centralized key 
   generation (e.g., the public-private key pair is generated by a CA).  
   The structure defined in this document allows the entity that 
   generates the private and public keys to distribute the key pair and 
   optionally the associated domain parameters. 

   A scenario in which this syntax is useful distributes EC private keys 
   using PrivateKeyInfo, as defined in PKCS #8 [RFC5208]. Distributing 
   an EC private key with PKCS#8 [RFC5208] involves including a) id-
   ecPublicKey, id-ecDH, or id-ecMQV (from [RFC5480]) with the 
   namedCurve as the parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm field b) 
   ECPrivateKey in the PrivateKey field, which is an OCTET STRING c) 
   optionally including any attributes in the attributes field. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Elliptic Curve Private Key Format 

   This section gives the syntax for an EC private key.  Computationally 
   an EC private key is an unsigned integer, but for representation, EC 
   private key information SHALL have ASN.1 type ECPrivateKey: 

   ECPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE { 
     version        INTEGER { ecPrivkeyVer1(1) } (ecPrivkeyVer1), 
     privateKey     OCTET STRING, 
     parameters [0] ECParameters {{ NamedCurve }} OPTIONAL, 
     publicKey  [1] BIT STRING OPTIONAL 
   }

   The fields of type ECPrivateKey have the following meanings:  

    o version specifies the syntax version number of the elliptic curve 
     private key structure. For this version of the document, it SHALL 
     be set to ecPrivkeyVer1, which is of type INTEGER and whose value 
     is one (1). 

    o privateKey is the private key.  It is a DER encoding of an octet 
     string of length [log2 n/8] (where n is the order of the curve) 
     obtained from the unsigned integer via following encoding:  

     Input: A non-negative integer x together with the desired length 
     mlen of the octet string. It must be the case that: 
     2^(8(mlen)) > x. 
      
     Output: An octet string M of length mlen octets. 
      
     Actions: Convert: 
      
     x = x[mlen-1]*2^(8(mlen-1))+x[mlen-2]*2^(8(mlen-2))+...+ 
     x[1]*2^8+x[0] represented in base 2^8=256 to an octet string  
      
     M=M[0]|M[1]|...|M[mlen-1], where | denotes concatenation, as 
     follows: 
     1. For 0 <= i <= mlen-1 set M[i]=x[mlen-1-i] 
     2. Output M. 

    o parameters, which is OPTIONAL, specifies the elliptic curve domain 
     parameters associated to the private key. The type ECParameters 
     are discussed in [RFC5480]. As specified in [RFC5480], only the 
     namedCurve CHOICE, which is an object identifier that fully 
     identifies the required values for a particular set of elliptic 
     curve domain parameters, is permitted. 

    o publicKey, which is OPTIONAL, contains the elliptic curve public 
     key associated with the private key in question. EC public keys 
     are discussed in Section 2.2 of [RFC5480]. 

4. Security Considerations 

   This structure does not protect the EC private key information in any 
   way.  This structure can be combined with a security protocol to 
   protect it.  

   Protection of the private-key information is vital to public-key 
   cryptography.  Disclosure of the private-key material to another

   entity can lead to masquerades.  The encryption algorithm used in the 
   encryption process must be as 'strong' as the key it is protecting. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.

Internet-Draft  MD5 and HMAC-MD5 Security Considerations      2010-12-29


1.  Introduction

   MD5 [MD5] is a message digest algorithm that takes as input a message
   of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or
   "message digest" of the input.  The published attacks against MD5
   show that it is not prudent to use MD5 when collision resistance is
   required.  This document replaces the security considerations in RFC
   1321 [MD5]. 

   [HMAC] defined a mechanism for message authentication using
   cryptographic hash functions.  Any message digest algorithm can be
   used, but the cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the
   properties of the underlying hash function.  [HMAC-MD5] defined test
   cases for HMAC-MD5.  This document updates the security
   considerations in [HMAC], which [HMAC-MD5] points to for its security
   considerations.

   [HASH-Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in many protocols and
   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's one-way
   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet
   protocols.  Familiarity with [HASH-Attack] is assumed.  One of the
   uses of message digest algorithms in [HASH-Attack] was integrity
   protection.  Where the MD5 checksum is used inline with the protocol
   solely to protect against errors an MD5 checksum is still an
   acceptable use.  Applications and protocols need to clearly state in
   their security considerations what security services, if any, are
   expected from the MD5 checksum.  In fact, any application and
   protocol that employs MD5 needs to clearly state the expected
   security services from their use of MD5. 

2.  Security Considerations

   MD5 was published in 1992 as an Informational RFC.  Since that time,
   MD5 has been studied extensively.  What follows are recent attacks
   against MD5's collision, pre-image, and second pre-image resistance. 
   Additionally, attacks against MD5 used in message authentication with
   a shared secret (i.e., HMAC-MD5) are discussed.

   Some may find the guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in
   [SP800-57] and [SP800-131] useful.

2.1.  Collision Resistance

   Pseudo-collisions for the compress function of MD5 were first
   described in 1993 [denBBO1993].  In 1996, [DOB1995] demonstrated a
   collision pair for the MD5 compression function with a chosen initial
   value.  The first paper that demonstrated two collision pairs for MD5
   was published in 2004 [WFLY2004]. The detailed attack techniques for

Internet-Draft  MD5 and HMAC-MD5 Security Considerations      2010-12-29


   MD5 were published at EUROCRYPT 2005 [WAYU2005]. Since then, a lot of
   research results have been published to improve collision attacks on
   MD5. The attacks presented in [KLIM2006] can find MD5 collision in
   about one minute on a standard notebook PC (Intel Pentium, 1.6GHz). 
   [STEV2007] claims that it takes 10 seconds or less on a 2.6Ghz
   Pentium4 to find collisions.  In
   [STEV2007][SLdeW2007][SSALMOdeW2009][SLdeW2009], the collision
   attacks on MD5 were successfully applied to X.509 certificates. 

   Notice that the collision attack on MD5 can also be applied to
   password based challenge-and-response authentication protocols such
   as the APOP option in the Post Office Protocol (POP) [POP] used in
   post office authentication as presented in [LEUR2007].

   In fact, more delicate attacks on MD5 to improve the speed of finding
   collisions have been published recently. However, the aforementioned
   results have provided sufficient reason to eliminate MD5 usage in
   applications where collision resistance is required such as digital
   signatures.

2.2.  Pre-image and Second Pre-image Resistance

   Even though the best result can find a pre-image attack of MD5 faster
   than exhaustive search as presented in [SAAO2009], the complexity
   2^123.4 is still pretty high.

2.3.  HMAC

   The cryptanalysis of HMAC-MD5 is usually conducted together with NMAC
   (Nested MAC) since they are closely related. NMAC uses two
   independent keys K1 and K2 such that                         
   NMAC(K1, K2, M) = H(K1, H(K2, M), where K1 and K2 are used as secret
   IVs for hash function H(IV, M). If we re-write the HMAC equation
   using two secret IVs such that IV2 = H(K Xor ipad) and            
   IV1 = H(K Xor opad), then HMAC(K, M) = NMAC(IV1, IV2, M).  Here it is
   very important to notice that IV1 and IV2 are not independently
   selected.

   The first analysis was explored on NMAC-MD5 using related keys in
   [COYI2006]. The partial key recovery attack cannot be extended to
   HMAC-MD5, since for HMAC, recovering partial secret IVs can hardly
   lead to recovering (partial) key K. Another paper presented at Crypto
   2007 [FLN2007] extended results of [COYI2006] to a full key recovery
   attack on NMAC-MD5. Since it also uses related key attack, it does
   not seem applicable to HMAC-MD5.

   A EUROCRYPT 2009 paper presented a distinguishing attack on HMAC-MD5
   [WYWZZ2009] without using related keys. It can distinguish an

   instantiation of HMAC with MD5 from an instantiation with a random
   function with 2^97 queries with probability 0.87. This is called
   distinguishing-H. Using the distinguishing attack, it can recover
   some bits of the intermediate status of the second block. However, as
   it is pointed out in [WYWZZ2009], it cannot be used to recover the
   (partial) inner key H(K Xor ipad).  It is not obvious how the attack
   can be used to form a forgery attack either.

   The attacks on HMAC-MD5 do not seem to indicate a practical
   vulnerability when used as a message authentication code. Considering
   that the distinguishing-H attack is different from a distinguishing-R
   attack, which distinguishes an HMAC from a random function, the
   practical impact on HMAC usage as a PRF such as in a key derivation
   function is not well understood.

   Therefore, it may not be urgent to remove HMAC-MD5 from the existing
   protocols.  However, since MD5 must not be used for digital
   signatures, for a new protocol design, a ciphersuite with HMAC-MD5
   should not be included.  Options include HMAC-SHA256 [HMAC][HMAC-
   SHA256] and [AES-CMAC] when AES is more readily available than a hash
   function.

Abstract

   This document describes conventions for using Elliptic Curve
   cryptographic algorithms with SignedData and EnvelopedData to protect
   the AsymmetricKeyPackage content type.  Specifically, it includes
   conventions necessary to implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDH) with EnvelopedData and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) with SignedData.  This document extends RFC 5959.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5959] describes conventions necessary to protect the
   AsymmetricKeyPackage content type [RFC5958] with Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMS) protecting content types: SignedData [RFC5652],
   EnvelopedData [RFC5652], EncryptedData [RFC5652], AuthenticatedData
   [RFC5652], and AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083].  This document amends
   [RFC5959] by extending the algorithms used with SignedData and
   EnvelopedData to include Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
   (ECDSA) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), respectively. 
   Familiarity with [RFC5959] and [RFC5753] is assumed.

   This document does not define any new algorithms; instead, it refers
   to previously defined algorithms.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  AsymmetricKeyPackage

   As noted in Asymmetric Key Packages [RFC5958], CMS can be used to
   protect the AsymmetricKeyPackage.  The following provides guidance
   for SignedData [RFC5652] and EnvelopedData [RFC5652] when used with
   Elliptic Curve algorithms.

2.1.  SignedData

   If an implementation supports SignedData, then it MAY support ECDSA 
   [RFC6090][RFC5753].

2.2.  EnvelopedData

   When key agreement is used, standard (as opposed to co-factor) ECDH
   [RFC6090][RFC5753] MAY be supported.

3.  Public Key Sizes

   The easiest way to implement the SignedData and EnvelopedData is with
   public key certificates [RFC5280][RFC5480]. If an implementation
   supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST support keys on the P-256 curve.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from [RFC5280], [RFC5480], [RFC5652],
   [RFC5753], [RFC5959], and [RFC6090] apply.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.   Please remove this section prior to publication as an RFC.

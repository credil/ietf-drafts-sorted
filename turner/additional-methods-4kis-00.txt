Internet-Draft      Additional Methods For AKI/SKI            June 2010

1. Introduction 

   [PKIX] defines the authority key identifier and subject key 
   identifier certificate extensions to allow one certificate to refer 
   to another certificate via the matching of these corresponding 
   values.  The principle use of this mechanism is to enable a relying 
   party to disambiguate between two CA certificates with the same 
   Subject name, located in the same directory entry.  These identifiers 
   are used during certification path construction as heuristic to 
   reduce relying party workload.  These identifiers are not used during 
   certificate path validation.  These key identifiers also are used by 
   other protocols, such as Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [CMP] 
   and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS], to identify the 
   certificate used to protect the message, session, etc. 

   [ECALGS] describes two mechanisms for generating AKI/SKI values: a 
   160-bit SHA-1 hash of the public key and a four-bit type field with 
   the value 0100 followed by the least significant 60 bits of the SHA-1 
   hash.  Both of these mechanisms were designed to be non-security 
   critical.  That is, the use a hash algorithm was intended to provide 
   a high probability (but not a guarantee) of uniqueness.  [PKIX] 
   allows for additional mechanisms. 

   This document defines four additional mechanisms that use SHA-224, 
   SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 [SHS]. Sample code for SHA-224, SHA-
   256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 can be found in [SHS-CODE]. The motivation 
   for defining these additional means of generating AKI/SKI values is 
   to accommodate use of additional, standard one-way hash functions 
   that are becoming more widely used in PKI contexts. 

   The plethora of options does not impact interoperability because key 
   identifiers are unilaterally generated by Certification Authorities 
   (CAs). Relying parties only compare and copy these values and thus 
   are insulated (for the most part) from the specific mechanisms used 
   to generate them. The additional key identifier generation mechanisms 
   described below maintain the 160-bit value size, to avoid adversely 
   affecting relying party code. With these additional mechanisms CAs 
   can omit code for algorithms that are otherwise unwanted or unused.

Internet-Draft      Additional Methods For AKI/SKI            June 2010 
    

   For example, a CA that issues certificates hashed with SHA-256 and 
   signed with ECDSA on the P-256 curve [ECALGS] might no longer need to 
   implement SHA-1 as part of their CA application. 

   This document updates Section 4.2.1.2 of RFC 5280 [PKIX]. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [WORDS]. 

2. Additional Methods for Generating Key Identifiers 

   As specified in [PKIX], both authority and subject key identifiers 
   SHOULD be derived from the public key.  Four additional mechanisms 
   CAs can use to identify public keys are as follows: 

    1) The keyIdentifier is composed of the least significant 160-bits 
       of the SHA-224 hash of the value of the BIT STRING 
       subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of 
       unused bits).  

    2) The keyIdentifier is composed of the least significant 160-bits 
       of the SHA-256 hash of the value of the BIT STRING 
       subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of 
       unused bits).  

    3) The keyIdentifier is composed of the least significant 160-bits 
       of the SHA-384 hash of the value of the BIT STRING 
       subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of 
       unused bits).  

    4) The keyIdentifier is composed of the least significant 160-bits 
       of the SHA-512 hash of the value of the BIT STRING 
       subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of 
       unused bits).  

3. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations of [PKIX] apply. 

   While hash algorithms provide collision resistance, this property is 
   not needed for key identifiers. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None.

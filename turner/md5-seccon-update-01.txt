1. Introduction 

   MD5 [MD5] is a message digest algorithm that takes as input a message 
   of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or 
   "message digest" of the input.  The published attacks against MD5 
   show and that it is not prudent to use MD5 when collision resistance 
   is required.  This document replaces the security considerations in 
   RFC 1321 [MD5].  

   [HMAC] defined a mechanism for message authentication using 
   cryptographic hash functions.  Any message digest algorithm can be 
   used, but the cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the 
   properties of the underlying hash function.  [HMAC-MD5] defined test 
   cases for HMAC-MD5.  This document updates the security 
   considerations in [HMAC-MD5]. 

   [HASH-Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in many protocols and 
   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's one-way 
   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet 
   protocols. 

2. Security Considerations 

   MD5 was published in 1992 as an Informational RFC.  Since that time, 
   MD5 has been studied extensively.  What follows are recent attacks 
   against MD5's collisions, pre-image, and second pre-image resistance.  
   Additionally, attacks against MD5 used in message authentication with 
   a shared secret (i.e., HMAC-MD5) are discussed. 

   Some may find the guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in 
   [SP800-57] and [SP800-131] useful. 

2.1. Collision Resistance 

   The first paper that demonstrates actual collisions of MD5 was 
   published in 2004 [WFLY2004]. The detailed attack techniques for MD5 
   were published at EUROCRYPT 2005 [WAYU2005]. Since then, a lot of 
   research results have been published to improve collision attacks on

Internet-Draft  MD5 and HMAC-MD5 Security Considerations    August 2010 
    

   MD5. The attacks presented in [KLIM2006] can find MD5 collision in 
   about one minute on a standard notebook PC (Intel Pentium, 1.6 GHz.).  
   In [STEV2007], he claim that it takes 10 seconds or less on a 2.6Ghz 
   Pentium4 to find collisions.  In 
   [STEV2007][SLdeW2007][SSALMOdeW2009][SLdeW2009], the collision 
   attacks on MD5 were successfully applied to X.509 certificates.  

   Notice that the collision attack on MD5 can also be applied to 
   password based challenge-and-response authentication protocols such 
   as APOP protocol used in post office authentication as presented in 
   [LEUR2007]. 

   In fact, more delicate attacks on MD5 to improve the speed of finding 
   collisions have published recently. However, the aforementioned 
   results have provided sufficient reason to eliminate MD5 usage in 
   applications where collision resistance is required such as digital 
   signatures. 

2.2. Pre-image and Second Pre-image Resistance 

   Even though the best result can find a pre-image attack of MD5 faster 
   than exhaustive search as presented in [SAAO2009], the complexity 
   2^123.4 is still pretty high. 

2.3. HMAC 

   The cryptanalysis of HMAC-MD5 usually conducted together with NMAC 
   (Nested MAC) since they are closely related. NMAC uses two 
   independent keys K1 and K2 such that NMAC(K1, K2, M) = H(K1, H(K2, 
   M), where K1 and K2 are used as secret IVs for hash functions 
   H(IV,M). If we re-write HMAC equation using two secret IVs such that 
   IV2 = H(K Xor ipad) and IV1 = H(K Xor opad), then HMAC(K, M) = 
   NMAC(IV1, IV2, M).  Here it is very important to notice that IV1 and 
   IV2 are not independently selected. 

   The first analysis was explored on NMAC-MD5 using related keys in 
   [COYI2006]. The partial key recovery attack cannot be extended to 
   HMAC-MD5, since for HMAC, recovering partial secret IVs can hardly 
   lead to recovering (partial) key K. Another paper presented at Crypto 
   2007 [FLN2007] extended results of [COYI2006] to a full key recovery 
   attack on NMAC-MD5. Since it also uses related key attack, it does 
   not seem applicable to HMAC-MD5. 

   A EUROCRYPT 2009 paper presented a distinguishing attack on HMAC-MD5 
   [WYWZZ2009] without using related keys. It can distinguish an 
   instantiation of HMAC with MD5 from an instantiation with a random 
   function with 2^97 queries with probability 0.87. This is called 
   distinguishing-H. Using the distinguishing attack, it can recover

   some bits of the intermediate status of the second block. However, as 
   it is pointed in [WYWZZ2009], it cannot be used to recover the 
   (partial) inner key H(K Xor ipad).  It is not obvious how the attack 
   can be used to form a forgery attack either. 

   The attacks on HMAC-MD5 do not seem to indicate a practical 
   vulnerability when used as a message authentication code. Considering 
   that the distinguishing-H attack is different from distinguishing-R 
   attack, which distinguishes an HMAC from a random function, the 
   practical impact on HMAC usage as a PRF such as in a key derivation 
   function is not well understood. 

   Therefore, it may not be urgent to remove HMAC-MD5 from the existing 
   protocols.  However, since MD5 must not be used for digital 
   signatures, for a new protocol design, a ciphersuite with HMAC-MD5 
   should not be included.

Abstract 

   This document specifies a media type used to carry PKCS#10 
   certification requests as defined in RFC 2986. It carries over the 
   original specification from RFC 2311, which recently has been moved 
   to Historic state, and properly links it to RFC 2986.

1. Introduction 

   [RFC2311] first defined the application/pkcs10 media type.  When 
   [RFC2633] was published, the application/pkcs10 section was dropped, 
   but for some reason the text was not incorporated into the PKCS#10 
   document [RFC2986].  [RFC2311] was moved to historic status by 
   [RFC5751].  To ensure the IANA media type registration points to a 
   non-historic document, this document updates [RFC2986] with the 
   definition of the application/pkcs10 media type and an IANA 
   registration based on [RFC4288]. 

   The text for Section 2 is adapted from Section 3.7 of [RFC2311]. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. Creating a Certification Request 

   A typical application which allows a user to generate cryptographic 
   information has to submit that information to a certification 
   authority (CA), who transforms it into a certificate.  PKCS #10 
   [RFC2986] describes a syntax for certification requests. The 
   application/pkcs10 media type MUST be used to transfer a PKCS #10 
   certification request. 

   The details of certification requests and the process of obtaining a 
   certificate are beyond the scope of this memo. Instead, only the 
   format of data used in application/pkcs10 is defined.

Internet-Draft      application/pkcs10 Media Type         February 2010 
    

2.1. Format of the application/pkcs10 Body 

   PKCS #10 defines the ASN.1 type CertificationRequest for use in 
   submitting a certification request. For transfer to a CA, this 
   abstract syntax needs to be encoded and identified in a unique 
   manner.  When the media type application/pkcs10 is used, the body 
   MUST be a CertificationRequest, encoded using the Basic Encoding 
   Rules (BER) [X.690]. 

   Although BER is specified, instead of the more restrictive DER 
   [X.690], a typical application will use DER since the 
   CertificationRequest's CertificationRequestInfo has to be DER-encoded 
   in order to be signed. 

   A robust application SHOULD output DER, but allow BER or DER on 
   input. 

   Data produced by BER or DER is 8-bit, but some transports are limited 
   to 7-bit data. In such cases, a suitable 7-bit transfer encoding MUST 
   be applied; in MIME-compatible transports, the base64 encoding 
   [RFC4648] SHOULD be used with application/pkcs10, although any 7-bit 
   transfer encoding may work. 

2.2. Sending and Receiving an application/pkcs10 Body Part 

   For sending a certificate-signing request, the application/pkcs10 
   message format MUST be used to convey a PKCS #10 certificate-signing 
   request. Note that for sending certificates and CRLs without any 
   signed content, the application/pkcs7-mime message format MUST be 
   used to convey a degenerate PKCS #7 signedData "certs-only" message 
   [RFC5751]. 

   To send an application/pkcs10 body, the application generates the 
   cryptographic information for the user. The details of the 
   cryptographic information are beyond the scope of this memo. 

   Step 1. The cryptographic information is placed within a PKCS #10 
   CertificationRequest. 

   Step 2. The CertificationRequest is encoded according to BER or DER 
   (typically, DER). 

   Step 3. As a typical step, the DER-encoded CertificationRequest is 
   also base64 encoded so that it is 7-bit data suitable for transfer in 
   ESMTP. This then becomes the body of an application/pkcs10 body part. 

   The result might look like this:

   A typical application only needs to send a certification request. It 
   is a certification authority that has to receive and process the 
   request. The steps for recovering the CertificationRequest from the 
   message are straightforward but are not presented here. The 
   procedures for processing the certification request are beyond the 
   scope of this document. 

3. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is asked to update the registration for the application/pkcs10 
   media type using the filled-in template from BCP 13 [RFC4288] given 
   below. 

3.1. Registration of media type application/pkcs10 

   The media type for a PKCS#10 certification request is 
   application/pkcs10. 

     To: ietf-types@iana.org 

     Subject: Registration of media type application/pkcs10 

     Type name: application 

     Subtype name: pkcs10 

     Required parameters: None 

     Optional parameters: None 

     Encoding considerations: 

      This media type carries binary content and needs proper encoding 
      for non-8bit clear transports; See Section 2.  

     Security considerations:

      Clients use a certification request to request that a 
      Certification Authority certify a public key.  The certification 
      request is digitally signed. 

     Interoperability considerations: See Section 2. 

     Published specification: RFC 2986 

     Applications which use this media type: 

      The content type is used with MIME-compliant transport to 
      transfer PKCS#10 certification requests [RFC2986].

Abstract

   There are times that an LSP source node needs to know change(s) has
   occurred along the originally established LSP path. This is
   especially true in the Mobile Backhaul environment where microwave
   transport is widely deployed. The bandwidth provided by the microwave
   transport can change with weather. The source LSR, e.g. LTE's eNodeB,
   needs to adjust its admission rate or shift more load to alternative
   paths when the backhaul transport path condition is changed.

   This draft describes a simple mechanism for transit LSRs to notify
   Source LSR of the path condition changes.

Internet-Draft    Path Condition Marking using BFD        January 2010

1. Motivation

   LSP's source node(s) can have multiple paths to the corresponding
   destination node(s).  Those paths can have different performance
   behavior such as delay, delay variation, bandwidth, and so on.  The
   LSP(s)' can carry traffic with various Class of Services (CoS). Some
   of the premium CoS require strict performance objectives to be met at
   all time, so it is desirable to have LSP's source node(s) to be
   notified if there is any condition change along the LSP path. That
   way the source node(s), which is aware of the performance objectives,
   can make the proper decision if an alternative path needs to be
   established, or the admission rate needs to be changed for the
   incoming traffic.

   A common example for the LSP condition change is the bandwidth
   fluctuation in Mobile Backhaul network, where Microwave transport is
   widely deployed. Most Microwave transport nodes adjust its bandwidth
   based on the weather. Even though there is RSVP-TE for individual
   links to advertise its available bandwidth to all the nodes in the
   routing domain, RSVP-TE might not be possible in some Mobile Backhaul
   environment where there might be multiple routing domains from base
   stations to MSO. If Source Nodes, i.e. LTE's eNodeB, are aware of the
   bandwidth change, they can adjust services accepted to the network,
   request other base stations to accept new calls, or trigger (or
   increase the frequency of) Performance Monitoring scheme.

   In other applications, some source LSRs want to get notified when
   there is congestion condition or port changes on the transit nodes,
   so that proper actions can be taken. MPLS-ECN (RFC 5129) specifies a
   mechanism for transit nodes to mark EXP bits when congestion happens.
   However, many deployed MPLS networks already use EXP bits to mark
   priority, making it not possible to use MPLS-ECN (RFC 5129) mechanism
   for the purpose of LSP change notification.

2. Analysis of potential methods

   There is MPLS-ECN (RFC 5129) marking on the MPLS header's EXP field
   when transit nodes encounter congestion. The problem with MPLS-ECN
   (RFC 5129) is that many deployed MPLS networks already use EXP bits
   to represent priority. Another issue with MPLS-ECN (RFC 5129) is that
   the congestion marking doesn't occur until congestion happens. When a
   transit link bandwidth is reduced, such as microwave transport link
   bandwidth reduction due to weather, queues on the transit node can

Internet-Draft    Path Condition Marking using BFD        January 2010


   quickly build up. Even if MPLS-ECN (RFC 5129) scheme is used, the
   queue on the transit node may already been overrun by the time the
   egress node recognizing the congestion and notifies the source node.

   When there is a hard event change on a transit LSR, such as bandwidth
   reduction or port change, an alternative approach is for the transit
   LSR to send a simple notification to the source node indicating the
   change occurred. However, the transit nodes may not know the source
   nodes of the LSPs (e.g. LDP LSPs). Although the transit LSR can get
   the source LSR's IP address from the MPLS-Ping Request message, the
   MPLS-Ping may not be triggered when there is condition change on the
   LSP path.

   Another alternative is to mark on the MPLS header to indicate the
   hard impairment event occurred on the path.  It is the similar
   approach as the MPLS-ECN (RFC5129). However, there are no available
   bits on the MPSL header for such marking.

3. BFD protocol extension for path condition impairment notification

   When periodic BFD is enabled between a pair of LSRs (the Source and
   the destination), the BFD frequency is based on a fixed interval,
   usually in the magnitude of milliseconds. Since MPLS-BFD is intended
   to traverse along the LSP path, a transit node has the information on
   the port to the downstream LSR and is aware of the downstream link
   status, including impairment status, such as bandwidth being reduced,
   port being altered, or congested. Therefore, BFD is a good choice for
   path condition impairment notification when BFD is enabled on the
   LSP.

   This draft suggests adding an optional Impairment section to the BFD
   Control Frame:

        0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | Type          | Length        |ImpairmentValue|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        Optional Routable IPV4 or IPV6 address of source LSR         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   If a source LSR of a LSP cannot do anything when the LSP path is
   impaired, then the source LSR SHOULD NOT include this optional
   section in the BFD control frame. When the Impairment section is not
   present in the BFD control frame, the transit LSR does not need to
   mark the path condition change indication.

Internet-Draft    Path Condition Marking using BFD        January 2010


   If the Source LSR can do something when the normal LSP path is
   impaired or altered, the Source LSR CAN include the optional
   Impairment section in the BFD Control Frame. If the Impairment
   section is attached, the transit LSR CAN do the following when
   experiencing downstream link impairment:

       The transit LSR SHOULD mark on the Impairment field of the
        condition of downstream link, and/or

       The transit LSR SHALL send a Path Condition Impairment
        Notification (PCIN) back to the source LSR if it knows the
        source LSR.

   The Impairment Value field can take one of the following values:

     Value   Meaning
   --------    --------
     1     port towards downstream LSR is congested
     2     Bandwidth of the link towards downstream LSR is reduced
     3     Port towards downstream LSR has been altered

   The optional Routable IP address in the Impairment Section is for
   transit LSR to send the Path Condition Impairment Notification back
   to the source LSR. Since BFD control frames between a pair of LSRs
   are exchanged frequently, it is not necessary for the transit node to
   send the Path Condition Impairment Notification every time there is
   BFD traversed. In order to minimize work required on transit node,
   source node takes the responsibility to indicate if it needs a
   notification from transit node when the transit node experiences
   downstream link impairment. When the Routable IP address is included
   in the Impairment Section of BFD control frame, transit node SHALL
   send back a Path Condition Impairment Notification to the Source LSR
   when impairment is encountered.

   The source LSR CAN perform the following actions upon receiving the
   Path Condition Impairment Notification from transit LSR.

       send more sophisticated inquiry messages to the transit LSR to
        diagnose what happened

       trigger performance monitoring scheme to measure the quality of
        the path

       re-adjust load balancing among the multiple paths from Source
        LSR to the Destination LSR

       Re-signal LSP to alternative path

       activate the secondary/protection path

       reduce admission rate (in the case of LTE eNodeB).

   When a transit node receives a BFD and its downstream link is
   impaired or altered, it CAN perform the following actions:

      1.             If the BFD doesn't have the Impairment section, do nothing.
        Simply forward the BFD to the next hop.

        Otherwise:

      2.             The transit node SHALL set the ImpairmentValue field accordingly
        and then forward the BFD to the next hop.

      3.             If Routable IP address is included in the Impairment section,
        the transit LSR SHALL construct the Path Condition Impairment
        Notification message and send it to the Source LSR.

4. Path Condition Impairment Notification

   Though a new message format can be specified for transit node to send
   the Path Condition Impairment Notification, it is always easier for
   LSR to use an existing message type, like LSP-Ping Echo Reply
   [RFC4379], with some minor modification to do the job.

   This draft suggests a message type similar to the MPLS-Ping Echo
   reply which is specified in Section 3 of RFC 4379 to indicate the
   Path Condition Impairment Notification with the following changes:

   RFC 4379 specifies that the Message Type of the LSP-Ping has one of
   the two values. This draft suggests adding a new value to indicate
   that the message is for Path Condition Impairment Notification in
   responding to BFD:

     Value   Meaning
   --------    --------
     1     MPLS echo request [RFC 4379]
     2     MPLS echo reply [RFC 4379]
     3     Path Condition Impairment Notification in responding to
               BFD

Internet-Draft    Path Condition Marking using BFD        January 2010


   [MPLS-Ping-Enhanced] introduced Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV. This                                                             1       draft suggests adding a new "Downstream Path Condition" sub-TLV to
   reflect the condition of the downstream link. When used alone, path
   condition impairment notification SHALL be activated upon receiving a
   BFD control Frame with the optional Routable IP Address included in
   the Impairment Section.  In this case, the Downstream Path Condition
   sub-TLV SHALL be the only sub-TLV in the Downstream Detailed Map
   [MPLS-Ping-Enhanced].  When the downstream path condition is included
   as a sub-type, the Return Code of the echo response message SHALL be
   set to "See DDM TLV for Return Code and Return SubCode".

   Downstream Path Condition Impairment sub-TLV SHOULD have the
   following field:

       0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |PathCondSubType| Length        |ImpairmentValue|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  BFD control Header field                                     |
      (All the head fields until My Discriminator, Your Discriminator)
     *                                                               *
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The ImpairmentValue is same as the value used in the BFD control
   (section 3 above).

5. Receiving Path Condition Impairment Notification

   It is out of the scope of this draft on what Source LSR will do upon
   receiving the Path Condition Impairment Notification.



6. Manageability Considerations

   This document does not add additional manageability considerations.




   1 The Downstream Path Condition sub-TLV can also be included in the normal LSP-Ping
   response to indicate that the downstream link, even though its connectivity is up,
   is impaired. This will be a separate draft amending the MPLS-Ping-Enhanced scheme.

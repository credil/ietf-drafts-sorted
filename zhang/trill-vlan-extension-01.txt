             To Address the Space Limitation of Inner VLAN
                draft-zhang-trill-vlan-extension-01.txt

Abstract

   TRILL is originally designed for customer networks. When it is used
   as a provider network to interconnect multiple separate users, the
   space of current Inner VLAN becomes insufficient. As an easy way, a
   new VLAN ID field is added to the Inner Ethernet frame. The new VLAN
   ID can be use in conjunction with the previous defined Inner VLAN.
   This mechanism is usually known as stacked VLANs(802.1ad, or QinQ).
   The stacked VLANs mechanism is analyzed in this document. The method
   to introduce a single longer VLAN field to current TRILL header is
   also analyzed in this document.  In addition, a novel MAC address
   rewriting mechanism is also brought forward to break the space
   limitation of the Inner VLAN. The MAC addresses of the native frame
   are not used for forwarding process in transit RBridges. When the
   packet enters the TRILL network, the ingress RBridge (Appointed
   Forwarder) uses a Virtual MAC (VMAC) address to replace the real MAC
   and embedded the native VLAN ID into this virtual MAC address. When a
   packet egresses from the TRILL network, the egress RBridge will use
   the real MAC address to replace the virtual MAC address and deliver
   it to the destination on the local link.

INTERNET-DRAFT               VLAN Extension                June 28, 2011


1. Introduction

   When multiple independent users run their own VLANs on the same TRILL
   network, TRILL has to configure one VLAN for each customer. However,
   the single Inner VLAN tag of TRILL can only identify 4094 VLANs which
   is not enough for multi-tenant scenarios. 

   To address this scalability issue, the first way that comes to our
   mind is to add a new VLAN tag to TRILL header. The newly added VLAN
   tag and the original Inner VLAN tag forms the stacked VLANs (QinQ or
   IEEE 802.1ad) which are widely used in provider bridging networks.
   IEEE 802.1ad requires minimal cooperation between each customer and
   the service provider [802.1ad]. As a mature Ethernet networking
   standard, QinQ is to be easily accepted as the way of VLAN extension
   for TRILL. The second way to extend the VLAN space limitation is to
   include a new field with more bits than current Inner VLAN. The MAC
   rewriting technique analyzed in this draft is the third way for TRILL
   to break the above limitation. It does not add extra bits to the
   frame, therefore the possibility of fragmentation and reassemble is
   lower than the other two methods.

   Traditional switches use the destination MAC address to look up the
   outgoing interface to the next hop. RBridges work in a different way.
   The MAC addresses are not used when transit RBridges are forwarding
   the frames across the TRILL network. In the MAC address rewriting
   method, a ingress RBridge writes the original VLAN tag into the MAC
   address field of the original frame; the egress RBridge write the MAC
   address back and deliver the packet to its destination host. The
   formerly Inner VLAN defined by TRILL will be used as the second VLAN
   tag in the stacked VLAN tags. This method does not change the header
   of TRILL and the transit RBridges need not be upgraded to support a
   provider network for multiple tenants environment. 

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Figure 2.1: An example of stacked VLANs used for multiple tenants scenario

   Take Figure 2.1 as an example, traffic from two different users is to
   be carried on the same TRILL network. Both of them choose the same
   customer VLAN 10. In order to segregate their traffic, the edge
   RBridge can assign a single, unique SVLAN ID for each user. User1
   gets SVLAN 50 and user2 gets SVLAN 51.

INTERNET-DRAFT               VLAN Extension                June 28, 2011


   However, the stacked VLANs mechanism (also known as QinQ) defined in
   [802.1ad] is currently not supported by TRILL. The native Inner
   Ethernet frame format is limited to 802.1q [TRILLbase]. When the
   limitation is relaxed to include the frame format of 802.1ad, the
   tagging function (to push or pop the S-tag) is required to be added
   to edge RBridges. 

   On the data plane, the ingress RBridge is required to be able to use
   S-tag and C-tag together to determine the egress RBridge for a known
   unicast frame. A hypothetical example of a MAC table is given in
   Figure 2.2 where RB1 may look up the destination MAC and the stacked
   VLAN IDs to determine the egress RBridge or local egress port. The
   first entry is for the end node from user1 network attacked to RB3
   while the second entry is for the end node from user2 attached to
   RB1. When the known unicast frame arrives at the egress RBridge, it
   will be delivered to its destination which belongs to the VLAN
   identified by S-tag and C-tag. The MAC addresses will not be
   processed by transit RBridges which overcomes the drawback of QinQ
   which bears a scalability issue within the core of the carrier
   network, where every core switch needs to learn and maintain
   forwarding entries for every customer MAC address [HVALN].

                  | RB1 |  50 |  10 |  0, 1   |
                  +-----+-----+-----+---------+
                  | RB1 |  51 |  10 |  0, 1   |
                  +-----+-----+-----+---------+

            Figure 2.3: The distribution tree table of RB2 

   Transit RBridges for known unicast frames are VLAN unaware unless
   VLAN mapping is intentionally performed. For multicast frames, even
   the transit RBridges need to examine the value of S-tag and C-tag
   since the pruning of the distribution tree is VLAN-based. Figure 2.3
   shows the distribution tree table of the transit RBridge RB2. The
   SVLAN and CVLAN IDs are read from the Inner Ethernet frame. The root
   (Distribution Tree IDentifier, DT-ID) of the distribution tree is
   identified by the egress nickname of the multicast native frame.
   Here, we suppose the distribution tree is RB1-RB2-RB3 and RB1 is the
   root.

   On the control plane, all the operations that are single VLAN tag
   based before should be changed into stacked VLANs based now. These
   operations include the multicast pruning, the end station address
   learning, the forwarder appointment, the VLAN mapping and so on. If
   QinQ is adopted, the TRILL header is retained. The native Inner

   Ethernet frame has more bits than before. This increases the
   possibility of generating oversize frames in TRILL which may cause
   fragmentation of the PDUs and loss of TRILL data frames.

3. Single Longer VLAN Field

         Figure 3.1: The TRILL VLAN identifier (TVLAN ID, TVID)

   The most immediate way to extend the VLAN space is to open up a
   longer field for VLAN identification. No matter what the user is, how
   many VLANs each user has, just assign a unique TVLAN ID (TVID) to
   each of these VLANs. As shown in Figure 3.1, a flat VLAN space is
   created instead of a hierarchical space in VLAN stacking. Different
   to the Q-tag, priority does not appear in this field. With TVLAN,
   TRILL needs to segregate all services (VLANs) from all the customers
   together. When two different tenants use the same VLAN ID, the edge
   RBridges ought to map them to two different TVIDs. For the scenario
   in Figure 2.1, VLAN 10 for User1 is mapped to TVID 50 while VLAN 10
   for User2 is mapped to TVID 60. By this way, the overlapped VLAN IDs
   are separated. 

   Core RBridges forward frames based on the TRILL header only while the
   VLAN ID from the customers will be concealed to the core network. The
   main benefit is that the core TVLAN tagging can be manipulated
   independently, therefore customer Ethernet native frames are carried
   transparently and securely by the core RBridge network.

   Similar to the VLAN stacking solution, in order to extend the
   numbering space of VLAN, the solution introduced here increases a bit
   overhead to the frame efficiency. With VLAN stacking, each customer
   controls its own VLAN numbering space which is independent of the
   space of other customers and that of the provider network. Although
   the hierarchical numbering space is the same as that of the flat
   numbering method, the practical numbering spaces are quite different.
   VLAN stacking can support 4094 users but most of the users have less
   than 4094 VLANs. Unused VLAN number for one user can not be used by
   another, which greatly reduces the numbering space compared to the
   flat numbering method.

4. MAC Rewriting

   The inner MAC address of the Ethernet native frame is not used by
   transit RBbridges, which creates the opportunity to revise the MAC
   field to deliver the VLAN tag. When a native frame enters the core

   RBridge network, its source MAC addresses will be rewritten by the
   edge RBridges to include a VLAN ID. The rewritten MAC is named as
   VMAC (Virtual MAC). When the TRILL frame with source VMAC egresses
   from the core RBridge network and arrives at the destination. The
   destination end station will learn this source VMAC and use it for
   data forwarding destined to the sender. An IP address to MAC address
   resolution will be replaced with an IP address to VMAC address
   resolution in the MAC rewriting mechanism. When the frame destined to
   the VMAC egresses from the core RBridge network, the VMAC will be
   mapped back to its real MAC by the edge RBridge who will take into
   charge of forwarding the frame to its destination on the local link.
   This mechanism avoid the revision of TRILL header and introduction of
   new Inner Ethernet native frame format. The ASICs of RBridges does
   not need to change much. Edge RBridges need to be configured to
   realize the MAC<->VMAC mapping. 


   There are two possible ways to realize the mapping between MAC and
   VMAC:
   A. sequentially numbering the hosts according to its bootstrapping
   time, set up a mapping database;
   B. a hash of the hosts' original MAC address, e.g., directly use the
   lower 3 bytes to fill in the lower 3 bytes of VMAC

   The bootstrapping becomes different:
   Previously: Bootstrapping means the storage of a host's MAC;
   Now: Bootstrapping means two steps: 1. Assign a VMAC to the real MAC
   of the host. 2. Store the attached host's VMAC

4.1. Protocol Extension

   A 24-bit Raw VLAN ID field is used to break the VLAN space limitation
   in TRILL networks. This field is named as Native VLAN ID field. The
   Inner VLAN ID originally defined by TRILL will be used us the second
   VLAN ID in the stacked VLANs mechanism.

   It is recommended that 3 bytes are used for native VLAN IDs and 3
   bytes are used for host identification. This partition can be tuned
   if necessary.

   Suppose the source MAC address of a is MAC_a. Host a looks up the ARP
   cache and find that MAC address of the destination is VMAC_b. The
   frame will be send to RB1 which is a's ingress RBridge. RB1 will
   replace the Inner.MacSA with VMAC_a according to its local mapping
   system. This Inner.MacSA will finally be learned by RB2 which is the
   egress RBridge. When RB2 receives the frame with VMACs, the VMAC_b
   will be replace with MAC_b which is the real MAC address of host b.
   Of course, the above egress RBridge has already announced the VMAC to
   the above ingress RBridge before hand. Therefore the ingress RBridge
   will directly use the announced VMAC to forwarding the frame. In
   fact, the ingress RBridge does not know the real MAC or the
   destination host, since ARP will translate IP to VMAC instead the
   real MAC. By default, for unicast packets, the VLAN ID in the source
   VAMC and the Destination VMAC should be the same.

    Figure 3.3: A broadcast packet forwarding from Host a to Host b

   Sometimes, a host need to send out broadcast frames, such as ARP
   query messages and ARP miss frames. The Inner.MacDA of broadcast
   frames are FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF. In Figure 2.2, the broadcast process is
   depicted. This Inner.MacDA will be replaced with 20001:FF-FF-FF and
   will be multicasted across the TRILL network according to the base
   protocol of TRILL [TRILLbase]. Suppose Inner.MacSA is EE-EE-EE-EE-EE-
   01. It will be replaced with 20001:EE-EE-01 at the ingress RBridge.
   Host b will learn host a's VMAC (20001:EE-EE-01) when it receives
   this broadcast frame and insert it into its ARP cache.

   For unknown unicast frame, the forwarding process is the same as
   known unicast only that RB1 has to multicast the unknown frame on to
   the TRILL network. Suppose host b is bootstrapped to RBx. RBx will
   finally egress the unknown unicast frame.

               Figure 3.3: Host a moves from RB1 to RB2. 

   When a host is moved to another port of RBridge or moved to a port of
   another RBridge, the VMAC used for layer2 data forwarding is changed
   since the new home RBridge may assign a different VMAC for this host.
   The black-hole issue is now replaced with an ARP outdated issue.

   There are several ways to solve this problem:

   1. The host immediately sends out gratuitous ARP to bootstrap to the
   new home RBridge and update the ARP cache of the remote host Hx; New
   home RBridge notify other RBridges the the new VMAC and other
   RBridges will send the frame to the new home RBridge;
   2. The old home RB1 need query all other RBridges through multicast
   using the manufacturer-assigned MAC address of Host a to check
   whether any had seen this before. The one (RB2) that has seen Host a
   will reply to the old home RB1. Before handover completes, old home
   RB1 take in charge of forwarding to RB2 and RB2 forward the packet to
   the host. After the handover finishes, the RB1 will send withdraw to
   null the address in RBx. 
   3.If the host has moved to another position, the home RBridge will
   send out the received packets to this host as unknown unicast packets
   with the VMAC be replaced with broadcast VMAC. This action continues
   until this home switch received the new location of the moved host.
   This mapping will be send out when the moved host finished the
   bootstrapping after movement. This can be achieved through gratuitous
   ARP. Gratuitous ARP is restricted in the local link. The new home
   switch will send out this mapping to outdate the old home switch. It
   can spread this bootstrapping information using TRILL ESADI
   mechanism.

4.4. Comparison

   The edge RBridges need to do mapping between original MAC and VMAC.
   The transit RBridges do not need to process the VMAC field. Only the

   RBridges need to read the MAC field to get the VLAN ID. Can work
   together with the VLAN stacking solution or the Single Longer VLAN
   Field solution. 

   MAC rewriting does not increase the possibility of fragmentation and
   reassembling since no additional field is introduced into TRILL
   header nor the Inner Native frame, which increases the frame
   encapsulation efficiency compared to the above two methods.

    Abstract 

       Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in RFC 5213 [1], is a network-
       based mobility management protocol. It uses a Mobile Access Gateway 
       (MAG) and a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to allow hosts to move around 
       within a domain while keeping their address or address prefix stable. 
       Although the issues of mobile multicast in the PMIPv6 network are 
       being discussed in the Multimob WG, how to provide the service 
       connectivity when the multicast source is moving is still a problem 
       for the PMIPv6. This document proposes and analyzes the potential 
       solutions of the multicast source mobility in PMIPv6.

      1. Introduction 

       Different from Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [2], PMIPv6 was proposed to 
       support the network-based mobility management. The entities in the 
       PMIPv6 have the responsibilities to track the Mobile Node (MN), 
       update the location of the MN and redirect the packets to and from 
       the MN. However, the basic PMIPv6 protocol only solves the mobility 
       management for the MN which is involved in the unicast communication. 
       In order to deploy the multicast service in the PMIPv6 network, many 
       schemes have been proposed [3-6]. However, all of these schemes aim 
       to support the multicast service for the mobile receiver. How to 
       support the multicast source mobility in the PMIPv6 network is a 
       newly planned work in the Multimob WG. Without doubt, the multicast 
       source mobility is also a very important issue for the deployment of 
       the multicast service. For example, there is an advanced concept 
       based on the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) service. In this 
       concept, all the vehicles on the same route are identified by using a 
       GPS or a car-navigation system. The vehicles multicast real-time 
       video information about the transportation through the communication 
       infrastructure like 3G, WiFi to the other vehicles interested in it. 
       This advance information is called as 'future vision' [7]. The 
       multicast source mobility is one of the core supporting schemes to 
       realize the above functions. 

       In this document, the potential solutions of the multicast source 
       mobility in PMIPv6 are proposed and analyzed.  

      2. Multicast Source mobility in PMIPv6 

       In PMIPv6 base solution, the LMA and the MAG are two most important 
       functional entities. According to different packet transmission paths 
       supporting multicast source mobility, two basic schemes are proposed 
       in this document. In the first case, all the multicast packets sent 
       out from the MN are directed to the LMA firstly and then transmitted 
       to the receivers according to the basic multicast routing protocols, 
       such as Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM). While in 
       the second case, the packets sent out from the MN can be directly 
       transmitted from the MAG to the receivers. For convenience, these two 
       schemes are denoted as the LMA-based scheme and the MAG-based scheme, 
       respectively. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the multicast source 
       mobility in PMIPv6 using this two schemes. 

       As shown in Figure 1, the paths among the MAGs and the LMA 
       represented by lines ("||") indicate the tunnels in base PMIPv6, 
       while the path depicted with stars ("*") denotes the multicast tree 
       of the LMA-based scheme and the path pictured with circles ("o") 
       shows the multicast tree of the MAG-based scheme.

        Figure 1: Architecture of the multicast source mobility in PMIPv6 
        
       In Section 2, the above two basic schemes of multicast source 
       mobility will be discussed in the scenarios of Any Source Multicast 
       (ASM) and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), respectively. Also some 
       suggestions about the choice of multicast source mobility solutions 
       are given. 

    2.1. Any Source Multicast  

       These two schemes can be differently deployed in this scenario. 

    2.1.1. LMA-based scheme  

       In the PMIPv6 network, the LMA is just the topological anchor point 
       of the source's Home Address (HoA). In this way, the join message 
       (HoA,G) is delivered to the LMA firstly and the LMA-based multicast 
       tree can be established. 

       In this case, the LMA allows a mobile source to continuously send 
       data to the group through the LMA-MAG tunnel firstly. And then the 
       packets are transmitted from the LMA to the receivers according to 
       the multicast routing protocols. When the MN hands over from one MAG 
       to another, only the PMIPv6 tunnel is updated and the movement of 
       source is transparent to the receivers.  

     
     
    Zhang et al.           Expires September,2011                 [Page 4] 
        
    Internet-Draft      MSM Support in PMIPv6 Network           March 2011 
     

       When the handover from the Rendezvous Point Tree (RPT) to the 
       Shortest Path Tree (SPT) happens, the join message destined for the 
       HoA is delivered to the LMA firstly. After the encapsulation, the 
       join message is redirected to the MAG through the LMA-MAG tunnel. 
       Then the MAG parses the join message and establishes the related 
       multicast state. However, the path between the LMA and the MN is 
       still used for the multicast packets transmission. Although the SPT 
       handover finishes, the practical path is not the topological shortest 
       path tree due to the existence of PMIPv6 tunnel.   

    2.1.2. MAG-based scheme  

       In the case, the MAG sends the packets originated by the MN to the RP 
       directly but not through the PMIPv6 tunnel. For this, the PMIPv6 
       packet transmission procedure needs to be adjusted in the multicast 
       case. In particular, when the MAG receives the packets destined for a 
       multicast group, it should not encapsulate them in the MAG-LMA tunnel 
       but directly tunnel them to the RP from the outgoing interface.  

       For this, the MAG should ignore and discard all the join messages 
       sent to the HoA. In this way, all the multicast packets originated by 
       the MN can always be sent through the tunnel between the MAG and the 
       RP. 

       For the receivers, the original join message is sent to the RP for 
       the (*,G) multicast service. Then the RP can redirect the multicast 
       packets received from the MAG to the receivers according to the 
       multicast routing protocol. 

       When the handover of the RPT to the SPT happens, the procedure is 
       similar to the statement in section 2.2.2. 

    2.2. Source-Specific Multicast  

       The SSM is denoted by the multicast source address and the multicast 
       group address (S,G). Receivers can receive the multicast data by 
       subscribing to the channel (S,G). These two schemes can also be 
       differently deployed in this scenario as the same as in the ASM 
       scenario. 

    2.2.1. LMA-based scheme  

       In SSM, the multicast receivers actively send the (S,G) subscribe 
       message to establish the SPT from the specific source to the 
       receivers. Accordingly, the SSM scenario with the LMA-based scheme is 
       similar to the SPT handover in the ASM scenario with the LMA-based 
       scheme. 
     
     
    Zhang et al.           Expires September,2011                 [Page 5] 
        
    Internet-Draft      MSM Support in PMIPv6 Network           March 2011 
     

       In this case, the subscribe message destined for the HoA is delivered 
       to the LMA firstly. After the encapsulation, the subscribe message is 
       redirected to the MAG through the LMA-MAG tunnel. Then the MAG parses 
       the subscribe message and establishes the related multicast state. 
       However, the current SPT path is not the topological shortest path 
       tree due to the existence of PMIPv6 tunnel.   

    2.2.2. MAG-based scheme  

       When the MAG-based scheme is adopted in the SSM, there are more 
       complex issues. All the multicast listeners are forced to know the 
       address of the MAG corresponding to the multicast service related HoA. 
       For this, the following three important issues should be solved. 

       1) How can the MAG/LMA know all the receivers' addresses? 

       2) How can the MAG/LMA notify all the receivers about the current MAG 
          the MN attached when the handover happens? 

       3) How can the MAG/LMA maintain the freshest list of all the 
          receivers or DRs (Designated Routers)? 

       Then, two possible approaches are listed as follows: 

       Passive approach: When a receiver wants to subscribe a multicast 
       group identified by (HoA,G), the related report message is sent to 
       its attached DR. The DR then constructs a subscribe message destined 
       for the HoA and sends this message to its upstream router. As the 
       anchor point of this HoA, the LMA receives the subscribe message. The 
       first subscribe message is transmitted to the MN through the LMA-MAG 
       tunnel. However, the MAG when receiving the subscribe message must 
       notify the receiver that the (HoA,G) identified multicast channel is 
       the same channel identified by (MAG,HoA,G). Then the DR resubscribes 
       the multicast group as the new subscribe message is sent to the MAG. 
       Afterwards, the new SPT is established between the receiver and the 
       MAG. When the MN hands over to a new MAG, all the receivers have to 
       be notified with the new (MAG,HoA,G) and the SPT should be refreshed.  

       Optionally, the notification procedure of the address of current MAG 
       can also be executed by the LMA.  

       Active approach: When a receiver wants to subscribe a multicast group 
       identified by (HoA,G), it should query for the topological location 
       of the (HoA,G) related multicast source firstly. When the querying 
       message is received by the LMA, the LMA notifies the receiver about 
       the MAG's address. Then the DR resubscribes the multicast group as 
       the new subscribe message (MAG,HoA,G) is sent to the MAG. Afterwards,

    Internet-Draft      MSM Support in PMIPv6 Network           March 2011 
     

       the new SPT is established between the receiver and the MAG. When the 
       MN hands over to a new MAG, all the receivers have to be notified 
       with the new (MAG,HoA,G) and the SPT should be refreshed. 

    2.3. LMA-based vs. MAG-based 

       In general, the LMA-based scheme is easy to implement and has very 
       low handover overhead and delay due to movement of the multicast 
       source, however, the packets transmission in this scheme incurs 
       packets transmission overhead and latency due to the sub-optimized 
       routing and tunneling overhead. Although the packet transmission 
       efficiency can be improved in the MAG-based scheme, it needs a high 
       handover overhead and delay and it is difficult to implement for the 
       essential extensions of the PMIPv6 protocol and the multicast routing 
       protocol. Even if the multicast tree has been established 
       successfully, it needs to be reconstructed even the MN moves between 
       two nearby MAGs, which may lead to frequent disruption and low 
       efficiency of the multicast service. The detailed comparison of the 
       two schemes in the different scenarios is described in Table 1.

       As shown in Table 1, the paths of the MAG-based SPT both in ASM and 
       SSM scenarios are the most optimal, but the establishment of the MAG-
       based SPT is difficult and also incurs high handover delay and 
       handover overhead. And the MAG-based SPT scheme in ASM and SSM needs 
       to extend multicast routing protocols, which may be outside of the 
       Multimob WG's scope and then difficult to implement. Thus, it is 
       suggested that the MAG-based SPT scheme should not be considered. 
       While the LMA-based schemes, not only in the ASM case but also in the 
       SSM case, are simpler for implementation than other schemes, because 
       extra extensions of the PMIPv6 protocol and the multicast routing 
       protocol are unnecessary. Besides, it can be seen from the Table 1 
       that the path of the MAG-based RPT is better than the LMA-based RPT 
       in ASM and is also a good choice for mobile multicast service. This 
       is because that the packets can be transmitted from the MAG to the RP 
       directly rather than the MAG-LMA tunnel. However, it is required the 
       MAG should be extended accordingly. In real applications, the LMA-
       based scheme and the MAG-based scheme in the ASM RPT scenario can be 
       selected according to network conditions and mobility characteristics 
       of the MN. Here we suggest introducing a negotiation capability 
       between the MAG and the LMA by some simple extensions of the PMIPv6 
       protocol specified in Section 3. The basic principle of the 
       negotiation is that the LMA with more global network information than 
       the MAG has the right to decide which schemes should be adopted. But 
       the specific negotiation approach is out of this document. 

    3. Extensions of PMIPv6 

       The signaling messages and the related processing of basic PMIPv6 
       should be extended in order to notify the multicast source-related 
       information from the MAG to the LMA. Besides, the extensions are used 
       for the negotiation between the MAG-based scheme and the LMA-based 
       scheme for a particular multicast source.  

    3.1. MAG 

       In order to provide the multicast service during the MN's movement, 
       the MAG must recognize that the attached MN is a multicast source and 
       the corresponding multicast address must also be learned. These 
       information can be learned by the MAG during the authentication phase 
       for example. The particular procedure is out of this document. 

       When the MAG finds that the attached MN is a multicast source, it 
       should send the extended Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the 
       LMA. In the extended PBU message, a one bit "S" flag is added and set 
       to "1". The multicast address is contained in the Multicast address 
       option when the "S" is set to "1". Besides, a one bit "J" flag is 
       added to indicate whether the MAG has the ability to adopt the MAG-

       based scheme. When the MAG finds that the "J" flag is set to "1" in 
       the extended Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) message from the LMA, 
       the MAG-based scheme can be used for the MN. Otherwise, the LMA-based 
       scheme is adopted for multicast service.  

    3.2. LMA 

       When receiving the extended PBU message, the LMA establishes a tunnel 
       to the MAG as specified in PMIPv6. And if the "J" flag is set with 
       "1" in the extended PBU message, the LMA will judge whether the MAG 
       should adopt the MAG-based scheme and indicate the MAG with the "J" 
       flag in the extended PBA message. If the "J" flag is set with "0" in 
       the extended PBU message, the LMA will also set the "J" flag with "0" 
       in the extended PBA message.

       S flag and Multicast address option   

       1-bit "Multicast source identification" flag is used to identify 
       whether this MN is a mobile multicast source. The flag is set to "1" 
       only if the corresponding PBU had the S flag set to "1". And when 
       this flag is set to "1", the related multicast address is attached in 
       the Multicast address option. 

       J flag 

       1-bit "MAG join" flag is used to identify whether the MAG should 
       establish the MAG-based multicast tree. When the J in the PBA is set 
       to "1" as the same value in the PBU message, the MAG will establish 
       the MAG-based multicast tree. However, when the J in the PBA is set 
       to "0" but its value in PBU is "1", the MAG-based scheme is not 
       allowed by the LMA. The reason of the allowance of the MAG-based 
       multicast tree establishment at the LMA is that the LMA has more 
       information than the MAG to make this decision.

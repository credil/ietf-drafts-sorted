Abstract

   Since NAT function on CGN box will make the IPv4 address re-used by
   more than one user, the packets sent outside CGN are not able to be
   identifid where they are from or which user they belong to according
   to the source address within the packets.  However, under some
   certain circumstances, knowing the original source IP address and the
   identity of the user who sends the packet out is necessary.  This
   document states the requirement of source address tracing briefly,
   and discusses the possible solution models for this issue.

Internet-Draft        Source Tracing Model for CGN         February 2011


1.  Introduction

   At this time of the document written, IPv4 addresses for IANA have
   been depleted.  The network is going to experience a long migration
   stage to IPv6.  Some transition solutions have been proposed, such as
   NAT444, DS-Lite, NAT64 and 6rd.  In these solutions, translation is
   an important technology.  The translator which executes the
   translation function in service provider network means Carrier Grade
   NAT (CGN) [I-D. draft-ietf-behave-lsn-requirements-00].  Here, the
   CGN scope in this document includes NAT44 and NAT64.

   NAT function on CGN box may make the IPv4 address in its address pool
   re-used by more than one user probably.  Thus the packet seen from
   the outside of CGN cannot be identified based on the source address
   in the packet, which means it is difficult to know what the original
   source IP address is before translation and which user sends the
   packet.  As the service providers consider their deployment solution
   of IPv6 transition, the source address tracing issue has been
   emphasized explicitly.  Under some certain circumstances it is
   required tracking the source of the packet.  Therefore, it is helpful
   for service provides to give a clear introduction on how to achieve
   the tracing of source address.  This document states the requirement
   for source address tracing and discusses the possible solution models
   for this issue.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirement Statement

   The requirement of tracing the source address is forced by mainly
   three reasons.  All the requirements below can happen not only in
   Fixed BroadBand (FBB) network, but also in Mobile BroadBand (MBB)
   network.  And [I-D. draft-ietf-v6ops-v6-in-mobile-networks-03]
   indicates the same issue as well, espectially for mobile network.

3.1.  Legal Requirement

   CGN box produces log records in which contains the session
   information used for packet translation.  Because of the huge number
   of NAT log, the log records will be exported to a external log
   server.  In order to monitor Internet, for some carriers, they are
   demanded conserving the NAT logs for a few months.  Once an illegal
   behavior is present on Internet, legal department will request the
   carrier find out the subscriber who did it.  Depending on the

   conserved logs, the carrier is capable of fulfilling the task.

   This type of requirement can be regards as non-realtime requirement.
   Generally, the source address tracing may happen later than the NAT
   binding state has been deleted on NAT box.

3.2.  Application Requirement

   Carriers may provide some applications to the users.  The application
   usually is a kind of application or service operated by the carrier
   itself.  The application or service will provide the users who have
   subscribed it.  For instance, a carrier supplies the subscribers with
   video, game, email and even broadband sevice management (maybe
   portal) by a unified web server.  As a result, the subscriber
   identification may be needed.  When a user visits the special
   application, the application server will identify the user by the
   source address.  However, because of the deployed CGN, the IP address
   got from the source address field in the packet may be shared by more
   than one user.  Thus, the application server must authenticate the
   subscriber by obtaining the original unique IP address assigned by
   the carrier, either an IPv4 private address or an IPv6 address.  As a
   matter of fact, this requirement is a real-time trait, which is
   unlike the former one.

   The figure depicts the NAT444 case.  The service provider allocates
   non-duplicated IPv4 address to different user's CPE.  When the
   application server receives a packet translated by CGN, it will be
   confused which user the packet belongs to.  Therefore, the
   authentication of application server could be incorrect.

3.3.  Existing Device Constriction

   Service providers also offer value-added services by advanced
   technologies, such as DPI, P2P cache and so on.  Here DPI is token as
   an example.  It seems that most of the DPI products deployed in the
   network currently cannot support IPv6.  It needs time for DPI vendors
   to develop IPv6 features.  As depletion of IPv4 address, if a carrier
   intends to deploy IPv6-only network and use NAT64 to help users
   access IPv4 Internet, the placement of CGN should be considered
   carefully.  This is a sort of real-time requirement as well.

                                     | CGN |    $
                                      -----     $


   The picture shows an example of possible network topology.  For
   different service providers, there may be a variation.  Since the
   existing DPI device does not support IPv6, the CGN with NAT64
   function should be located lower, leaving the DPI in IPv4 realm.  The
   carrier provides a value-added service, which depends on DIP to deal
   with billing and accounting.  Because not all the users will
   subscribe the value-added service, and the source IPv4 addresses have
   been shared, DPI is not able to attach the traffic to the exact user.
   As a result source address tracing is inevitable in this case.

4.  Solution models for Source Address Tracing

   In order to meet the foregoing requirements, service providers have
   to take the solution of source address tracing into account.  In this
   section, the possible tracing models are discussed for reference.

4.1.  Non-realtime Tracing Model

   The non-realtime tracing of source address is always suitable for
   legal requirement.



Zhang                    Expires August 20, 2011                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Source Tracing Model for CGN         February 2011


   The aim of tracing is to find out the user information.  The lookup
   action happening on AAA server is indispensable.  Hence, the AAA
   server should be provided with necessary lookup means, such as web,
   telnet and so on.  As AAA server only has the binding between the
   user information and its IP address assigned originally, the log
   server is requested working together with AAA server.  AAA server
   will obtain the translation binding according to the public IP
   address and using time from the log server.  The public address and
   using time may be given by legal department.  In this process, a
   special interface on log server should be implemented for responding
   the AAA's query message.

   The process could be demonstrated by the following figure.  The
   operating node would be any PC or terminal by which the carrier
   launches the source address tracing.

         |  web login or telnet  |                        |
         |---------------------->|                        |
         |                       |                        |
         |  user info lookup     |                        |
         |---------------------->|                        |
         |                       |                        |
         |                       |translation record query|
         |                       |----------------------->|
         |                       |                        |
         |                       |session record response |
         |                       |<-----------------------|
         |                       |                        |
         |  user info response   |                        |
         |<----------------------|                        |
         |                       |                        |

4.2.  Realtime Tracing Model

   The realtime tracing satisfies the need of user identity
   authentication of certain services or subscriber management, e.g.
   policy and billing.  The tracing takes place when the user is online
   and initializing the service accessing.  On account of this, the
   translation binding state is still preserved on CGN.  Therefore, the
   NAT binding of session will be acquired from CGN, but not log server,
   in realtime tracing model.  (If getting the binding state by log
   server with the same way as the non-realtime model, it could be
   unreliable.  It is because that some CGN implementations may not send
   out the log message to log server before the session is expired or
   the session state is deleted.)  So, CGN is demanded a interface for
   querying the NAT binding of session.

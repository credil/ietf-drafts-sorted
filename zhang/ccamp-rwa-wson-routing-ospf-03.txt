1. Introduction 

   [WSON-Frame] provides a framework for applying GMPLS [RFC3945] and 
   the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture [RFC4655] to the 
   control of WSONs to address the RWA problem. [WSON-Info] describes an 
   information model that specifies the information needed at various 
   points in a WSON in order to compute paths and establish Label 
   Switched Paths (LSPs). Based on the information model of [WSON-Info], 
   [GEN-Encode] and [RWA-Encode] provide efficient protocol-independent 
   encodings of the information needed by the RWA process in a WSON. 
   Such encodings can be used to extend GMPLS signaling and routing 
   protocols.    

   This document provides RWA OSPF extensions based on [GEN-Encode] 
   which provides encodings of the information needed by the routing and 
   label assignment process in technologies such as WSON but that are

Internet-Draft        OSPF Extensions for WSON              March 2010 
    

   potentially applicable to a wider range of technologies. Additional 
   RWA OSPF extensions based on [RWA-Encode] which provides encodings of 
   the information specific to WSON technologies such as signal 
   compatibility and wavelength resource encodings are addressed in the 
   other document [WSON-COM-OSPF].  

   This document defines extensions to the OSPF routing protocol to 
   enhance the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of GMPLS TE which are 
   defined in [RFC3630], [RFC4202], and [RFC4203]. The enhancements to 
   the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of GMPLS TE links can be 
   announced in OSPF TE LSAs. The TE LSA, which is an opaque LSA with 
   area flooding scope [RFC3630], has only one top-level 
   Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplet and has one or more nested sub-TLVs 
   for extensibility. The top-level TLV can take one of three values (1) 
   Router Address [RFC3630], (2) Link [RFC3630], (3) Node Attribute 
   [OSPF-Node].  In this document, we enhance the sub-TLVs for the Link 
   TLV and Node Attribute TLV in support of RWA in WSON under the 
   control of GMPLS.  

   The detail encoding of OSPF extensions is not redefined in this 
   document. [GEN-Encode] provides encoding detail.  

   No consideration of optical impairment routing related information is 
   included in this document. 

2. Node Information 

   According to [WSON-Info] and [GEN-Encode], the node information about 
   WSON nodes includes Node ID, connectivity matrix. Except for the Node 
   ID which should comply with Routing Address described in [RFC3630], 
   the other pieces of information are defined in this document. 

   [OSPF-Node] defines a new top TLV named the Node Attribute TLV which 
   carries attributes related to a router/node. This Node Attribute TLV 
   contains one or more sub-TLVs.  

   Per [GEN-Encode], we have identified the following new Sub-TLVs to 
   the Node Attribute TLV. Detail description for each newly defined 
   Sub-TLV is provided in subsequent sections:  

      Sub-TLV Type    Length       Name 

         TBD          variable    Connectivity Matrix 

   In WSON networks, generally the sub-TLVs above is optional, which 
   depends on the control plane implementations. Usually, Connectivity 
   Matrix sub-TLV may appear in the LSAs because WSON switches are

Internet-Draft        OSPF Extensions for WSON              March 2010 
    

   asymmetric at present. It is assumed that the switches are symmetric 
   switching, if there is no Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV in the LSAs.  

2.1. Connectivity Matrix 

   It is necessary to identify which ingress ports and wavelengths can 
   be connected to (the same wavelength on) a specific egress port, 
   because the switching devices in a WSON are highly asymmetric. 

   The Connectivity Matrix is used to identify these restrictions, which 
   can represent either the potential connectivity matrix for asymmetric 
   switches (e.g. ROADMs and such) or fixed connectivity for an 
   asymmetric device such as a multiplexer as defined in [WSON-Info]. 

   The Connectivity Matrix is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of the 
   Node Attribute TLV. The length is the length of value field in octets. 
   The meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in Section 5.3 of 
   [GEN-Encode]. One sub-TLV contains one matrix. The Connectivity 
   Matrix sub-TLV may occur more than once to contain multi-matrices 
   within the Node Attribute TLV.  

3. Link Information 

   The most common link sub-TLVs nested to link top-level TLV are 
   already defined in [RFC3630], [RFC4203]. For example, Link ID, 
   Administrative Group, Interface Switching Capability Descriptor 
   (ISCD), Link Protection Type, Shared Risk Link Group Information 
   (SRLG), and Traffic Engineering Metric are among the typical link 
   sub-TLVs.  

   For WSONs, per [WSON-Info] and [GEN-Encode], we add the following 
   additional link sub-TLVs to the link-TLV in this document.     

      Sub-TLV Type    Length       Name 

         TBD          variable    Port Label Restrictions 

         TBD          variable    Available Labels 

         TBD          variable    Shared Backup Labels 

   In WSON networks, generally all the sub-TLVs above are optional, 
   which depends on the control plane implementations. It is default no 
   restrictions on wavelength, so Port Label Restrictions sub-TLV may 
   not appear in the LSAs. In order to be able to compute RWA, Available

   Labels sub-TLV may appear in the LSAs. Without available wavelength 
   information, path computation need guess what lambdas may be 
   available (high blocking probability or distributed wavelength 
   assignment may be used). Shared Backup Labels sub-TLV SHOULD not 
   appear in the LSAs, if there is no wavelength backup functionality in 
   the WSON networks. 

3.1. Port Label Restrictions 

   Port Label Restrictions describes the wavelength restrictions that 
   the link and various optical devices such as OXCs, ROADMs, and 
   waveband multiplexers may impose on a port in WSON. These 
   restrictions represent what wavelength may or may not be used on a 
   link and are relatively static. The detailed information about Port 
   label restrictions is described in [WSON-Info]. 

   The Port Label Restrictions is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of 
   the Link TLV. The length is the length of value field in octets. The 
   meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in Section 5.4 of 
   [GEN-Encode]. The Port Label Restrictions sub-TLV may occur more than 
   once to specify a complex port constraint within the link TLV. 

3.2. Available Labels 

   Available Labels indicates the wavelengths available for use on a 
   link as described in [GEN-Encode] in WSON. The Available Labels is a 
   sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of the Link TLV. The length is the 
   length of value field in octets. The meaning and format of this sub-
   TLV are defined in Section 5.1 of [GEN-Encode]. The Available Labels 
   sub-TLV may occur at most once within the link TLV. 

   Note that there are five approaches for Wavelength (Label) Set which 
   is used to represent the Available Labels described in [GEN-Encode]. 
   Considering that the continuity of the available or unavailable 
   wavelength set can be scattered for the dynamic wavelength 
   availability, so it may burden the routing to reorganize the 
   wavelength set information when the Inclusive (/Exclusive) List 
   (/Range) approaches are used to represent Available Wavelengths 
   information. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that only the Bitmap Set be 
   used for representation Available Wavelengths information.  

   The "Base Label" and "Last Label" in label set defined in [GEN-Encode] 
   corresponds to base wavelength label and last wavelength label in 
   WSON, the format of which is described as follows:

   The detailed information related to wavelength label can be referred 
   to [Lambda-Labels] 

3.3. Shared Backup Labels 

   Shared Backup Labels indicates the wavelengths available for shared 
   backup use on a link as described in [GEN-Encode] in WSON. 

   The Shared Backup Labels is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of 
   the Link TLV. The length is the length of value field in octets. The 
   meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in Section 5.2 of 
   [GEN-Encode]. The Shared Backup Labels sub-TLV may occur at most once 
   within the link TLV. 

4. Routing Procedures  

   All the sub-TLVs are nested to top-level TLV(s) and contained in 
   Opaque LSAs. The flooding of Opaque LSAs must follow the rules 
   specified in [RFC2328], [RFC2370], [RFC3630], [RFC4203] and [OSPF-
   Node]. 

   In the WSON networks, the node information and link information can 
   be classified as two kinds: one is relatively static information such 
   as Node ID, Connectivity Matrix information; the other is dynamic 
   information such as Available Wavelengths information. [GEN-Encode] 
   give recommendations of typical usage of previously defined sub-TLVs 
   which contain relatively static information and dynamic information. 
   An implementation SHOULD take measures to avoid frequent updates of 
   relatively static information when the relatively static information 
   is not changed. A mechanism MAY be applied such that static 
   information and dynamic information are contained in separate Opaque 
   LSAs to avoid unnecessary updates of static information when dynamic 
   information is changed. 

   Note that as with other TE information, an implementation SHOULD take 
   measures to avoid rapid and frequent updates of routing information 
   that could cause the routing network to become swamped. A threshold 
   mechanism MAY be applied such that updates are only flooded when a 
   number of changes have been made to the wavelength availability

   information within a specific time. Such mechanisms MUST be 
   configurable if they are implemented. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other   
   than those discussed in [RFC 3630], [RFC 4203]. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   [RFC3630] says that the top level Types in a TE LSA and Types for 
   sub-TLVs for each top level Types must be assigned by Expert Review, 
   and must be registered with IANA. 

   IANA is requested to allocate new Types for the sub-TLVs as defined 
   in Sections 2.1, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 as follows: 

6.1. Node Information 

   This document introduces the following sub-TLVs of Node Attribute TLV 
   (Value TBD, see [OSPF-Node]) 

   Type   sub-TLV 

   TBD    Connectivity Matrix 

6.2. Link Information 

   This document introduces the following sub-TLVs of TE Link TLV (Value 
   2) 

   Type   sub-TLV 

   TBD    Port Label Restrictions 

   TBD    Available Labels 

   TBD    Shared Backup Labels

Intellectual Property     

   The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of   
   any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be   
   claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology   
   described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license   
   under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it   
   represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any   
   such rights. 

   Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF   
   Secretariat and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or   
   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or   
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or   
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR   
   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr 

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any   
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary   
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement   
   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please   
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org.

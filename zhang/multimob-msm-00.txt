     Abstract 

        The NetLMM WG has specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) for network-
        based localized mobility management, taking basic support for 
        registration, de-registration and handover of Mobile Node (MN) into 
        account in the RFC 5213 [1]. Although the mobile multicast provision 
        in the PMIPv6 network is being discussed in the multimob WG, how to 
        provide the service connectivity during the movement of MN which is a 
        multicast source, is a problem still up in the air for the PMIPv6. 
        This document discusses the extension of the PMIPv6 to support the 
        multicast source mobility.

      1. Introduction 

        Be different with the MIPv6[2], the PMIPv6 [1] was proposed to 
        support the network-based mobility management. The entities in the 
        PMIPv6 have the responsibility to track the MN, update the location 
        of the MN and redirect the packets to and from the MN. However, the 
        basic PMIPv6 protocol only solves the mobility management for the 
        single MN, which is only focus on the unicast transmission. In order 
        to deploy the multicast service in the PMIPv6 network, many schemes 
        are proposed [3-6]. However, all of these schemes focus on how to 
        support the multicast service for the mobile receivers. While how to 
        support the multicast source mobility in the PMIPv6 network is not 
        discussed yet. So in this document, a multicast source mobility 
        supporting scheme is proposed. In this scheme, the basic PMIPv6 
        signaling is extended and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) which acts 
        as the RP (Rendezvous Point), responses to the join message sent to 
        the source (MN). Then the multicast packets are sent from MN to the 
        LMA as the basic PMIPv6 specified, however, the packets are 
        transmitted through the multicast tree established between LMA and 
        the receivers using the traditional multicast routing protocols.  

      2. Problem statement 

        When the MN is the multicast source, all the multicast packets will 
        be transmitted through the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) from the source 
        to the receiver. In this way, the stability of the multicast tree 
        decreases with the increased handover rates of the MN. That is because 
        the multicast tree must be refreshed when the root of the multicast 
        tree changes its location. However, according to the basic PMIPv6 
        specification, all the packets to and from the MN must be transmitted 
        to the LMA through the LMA-MAG tunnel firstly. That means the LMA is 
        a fixed point on the way to and from the MN. So we can set the LMA to 
        be the RP and the proxy source of the multicast. And the following 
        packet transmission method is proposed in this document. 

        The multicast packets sent by the MN is firstly sent to the LMA as 
        traditional PMIPv6 specified and then the packets are transmitted 
        according to the multicast routing protocols from the LMA to the 
        receivers.  

        However, the packets transmission proposed above incurs serious 
        packets transmission overhead and latency due to the sub-optimized 
      
      
     Zhang et al.            Expires December,2010                  [Page 3] 
         
     Internet-Draft       MSM Support in PMIPv6 Network            June 2010 
      

        routing and tunneling overhead. So the MN should decide how to 
        establish the multicast tree: when the MN hands over between MAGs in 
        a low rate, the multicast join should be processed by the MN itself 
        and the SPT should be established between the MN and the receivers, 
        while when the MN hands over between MAGs in a high rate, the method 
        proposed above should be used. 

      3. Extension of PMIPv6 

        In order to support the mobility of the multicast source, the LMA is 
        selected to be the RP of the mobile multicast service. Besides, the 
        join message is processed by the LMA or the MN, which is decided by 
        the MN and indicated to the LMA. Then the signaling message and the
	 related processing should be extended.  

     3.1. MN 

        In order to provide the multicast service even during its movement, 
        the MN should indicate this information to the attached MAG through 
        the interface between MAG and MN. For example, the MAG may get this 
        information during the authentication phase. In this document, we do 
        not specify how to get this information, but the MAG must get the 
        multicast address corresponding to the multicast service provided by 
        the MN and the indication of whether the MN wants to process the join 
        message itself. 

     3.2. MAG 

        When the MAG finds that the attached MN is a multicast source, it 
        should send the extended Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the 
        LMA. In the extended PBU message, a one bit "S" flag is added and set 
        to "1", which means the MN is a multicast source. The multicast 
        address is contained in the PBU message as a Multicast Address
        option when the "S" is set to "1". Besides, a one bit "J" flag is 
        added to indicate whether the LMA should receive and process the join 
        message sent to the MN. When the MAG finds that the "J" flag is set 
        to "1", it should not encapsulate the multicast packets into the bi-
        directional tunnel but transmit them according to the traditional 
        multicast routing protocol. In this case, the MAG has to set up the 
        multicast routing table according to the traditional multicast 
        routing protocol.

     3.3. LMA 

        When receiving the extended PBU message, the normal PMIPv6 tunnel is 
        established between LMA and MAG. Besides, the LMA recognizes that it 
        should act as the RP for the multicast specified by the Multicast 
        Address option. Besides, when the "J" flag is set to "1", the LMA 
        who receives the join message sent to the MN will response to it and 
        establish the SPT between LMA and the receiver. In order to find the 
        RP for the receiver, the corresponding information of "Multicast 
        address<->address of RP" has to be learned by the receiver. And this 
        is out of the scope of the document. 

      4. Multicast source mobility procedure 

        According to the indication from the MN, different multicast tree 
        establishment methods are adopted.

                  Figure 1 msm in the first case 

        1) As illustrated in the figure, the "S" bit ,the multicast address 
           and the "J" flag can be contained in the Router Solicitation(RS) 
           message sent from the MN to the MAG; 

        2) When the attachment of MN is detected by the MAG1, an extended 
           PBU message is sent to the LMA. And then the bi-directional 
           tunnel is established between MAG1 and LMA. Because the LMA finds 
           the extended information contained in the PBU message, the LMA 
           acts as the RP of the multicast service corresponding to the 
           multicast address and responses to the join message sent to the 
           MN; 

        3) The multicast packets are sent from the MN to the LMA as the 
           basic PMIPv6 specified. Since the SPT will be established between 
           LMA and the receiver, the packets are transmitted according to 
           the multicast routing protocol between LMA and the receiver; 

        4) When the MN moves to the MAG2, the multicast related information 
           is transmitted to the new MAG; 

        5) Then the LMA-MAG bi-directional is refreshed, however, the SPT 
           between LMA and the receiver is not affected; 

        6) So the multicast packets transmission is continued after the 
           handover and the mobility of the source is transparent to the 
           receiver.

                  Figure 2 msm in the second case 

        1) As illustrated in the figure, the "S" bit ,the multicast address 
           and the "J" flag can be contained in the RS message sent from MN 
           to the MAG; 

        2) When the attachment of MN is detected by the MAG1, an extended 
           PBU message is sent to the LMA. And then the bi-directional 
           tunnel is established between MAG1 and LMA. Because the LMA finds 
           the extended information contained in the PBU message, the LMA 
           acts as the RP of the multicast service corresponding to the 
           multicast address but it will not response to the join message 
           sent to the MN; 

        3) The multicast packets are sent from the MN to the LMA as the 
           basic PMIPv6 specified firstly. But when the LMA redirects the 
           join message to the MN, the SPT is established between MN and the 
           receiver and the following packets are transmitted through the 
           optimized path; 

        4) When the MN moves to the MAG2, the multicast related information 
           is transmitted to the new MAG; 

        5) Then the LMA-MAG bi-directional is refreshed; 

        6) However, the SPT must be refreshed because the root of the 
           multicast tree moves to a different location.

      5. Security Considerations 

        The MAG should be responsible for the multicast service management 
        for the mobile source because the packets may be not transmitted to 
        the LMA.

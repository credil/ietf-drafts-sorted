 Extending the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for Graceful Restart
                         draft-zhang-vrrp-gr-00

Abstract

   Many existing routers enable their data planes to keep forwarding
   data packets during the restart of their control plains.  This
   functionality is called "graceful restart" or "non-stop forwarding".
   A router supporting graceful restart is able to provide more reliable
   packet forwarding service during system maintaining procedures and
   software-error recoveries.  This informational document analyzes the
   issues with enhancing VRRP to support graceful restart and introduces
   several candidate solutions.

Internet-Draft        VRRP extension supporting GR         December 2010


1.  Introduction

   VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) [RFC3768] is an election
   protocol which organizes a group of routers on a same LAN as a
   virtual router providing high available services for users.  VRRP can
   dynamically assign the responsibility in processing the traffic for
   the virtual router to one of the VRRP routers in the group, which is
   called a master router and others are referred to as backup routers.
   Backup routers monitor the states of the master router by monitoring
   the periodical advertisement packets sent by the master router.  If
   backup routers cannot receive the advertisements for a pre-specified
   period, backup routers then believe that the master router cannot
   work properly and carry out an election.  The router with the highest
   priority will be assigned as the new master router.  Note that if the
   pre-master router has a higher priority than the newly elected one,
   it will try to seize its privilege back after solving its problem.
   In practice, the frequent switch of the master responsibility may
   introduce considerable overheads to the involved VRRP routers.  On
   some occasions, routers may be busy with processing state
   transformation and fail to send signaling packets on time, which in
   the worst case can seriously disrupt the operations of VRRP routers.
   An intuitive solution to mitigate such issues is to implement the
   VRRP protocol at the data plain so that VRRP state will not be
   affected when the control plain cannot work appropriately.  However,
   this approach breaks the boundary between the data plain and the
   control plain of the router architecture, and may introduce
   additional complexity in the design and implementation.  This issue
   can be mitigated by extending VRRP to support Graceful restart (GR),
   which is a popular technology integrated in large amounts of routers.
   A router supporting GR is able to forward data packets while its
   control plain is being restarted.  When a master gracefully restarts,
   it is still able to process the packets of the virtual router, and
   thus its responsibility does not have to be taken over by others.
   This informational draft analyzes the issues with enhancing VRRP to
   support GR so as to mitigate the issues discussed above.
   Additionally, candidate solutions are introduced.  Normally, the
   proposed solutions need the cooperation of GR supporting IGPs.

3.1.  Implicit Solutions

   In order to prevent backup routers to raise a new election before the
   master router finishes its GR, the master router can simply extend
   the interval between its hello packets during the restart period.
   The master can achieve this by multicasting a hello packet with an
   extended interval (noted by T-GR) to its router before the restart.
   T-GR should be long enough for the master router to finish the
   restart.  After receiving the hello packet, backup routers notice the
   change of the interval and then update their MasterDown timers with
   it.  If the master achieves the restart in time, it will send hello
   packets with the normal interval.  Again, backup routers will notice
   the change of the interval and reset their MasterDown timers with the
   new interval.  However, if backup routers do not receive any new
   hello packets from the master router after waiting for T-GR, they
   will perform a new election process.  A good thing of this solution
   is that it does not introduce any additional signaling packets.
   Routers only needs modify their internal operations.

3.2.  Explicit Solutions

   The implicit solution introduced in section 4.1 is simple and
   effective in supporting graceful restart.  However, in many typical
   scenarios, it is desired to explicitly clarify the start and the end
   of a GR.  For instance, assuming two routers supporting GR are
   redundantly deployed to provide a highly available BRAS (Broadband
   Remote Access Router) service for users.  A GR supporting extension
   of VRRP is executed to decide the role that each router acts as.
   Additionally, user information for access control is synchronized
   between the master router and the backup router.  Therefore, when the
   master router cannot work properly, the backup router can take over
   it without breaking the access of the online users to the Internet.
   When the master router is gracefully restarted, it is still able to
   forward data packets for the users which have been already
   registered.  So, the backup router can just wait for the finish of
   the restart rather than taking place of the master router to serve
   the users.  However, the user information maintained in the control
   plain of the master router may be lost during the restart.  The
   backup router then needs to help the master router re-create the
   states after the accomplishment of the GR.  Therefore, after the GR,
   the master router needs to explicitly inform the backup router that
   it has finished the GR and been ready for synchronizing the user
   information.


4.  Issues

   Several issues are listed as follows:

   1.  In practice, a newly restarted control plain can be busy in a
   certain period so that it may not always be able to send signaling
   packets according to the required interval.  This issue may result in
   repeatedly triggering election procedures and seriously disturb the
   operations of VRRP routers.  This issue should be considered during
   the design of the GR supporting extension of VRRP.

   2.  As mentioned above, during a GR, the control plain of the router
   cannot work properly.  Therefore, a VRRP backup group executing
   certain services (e.g., BRAS) cannot accept any register queries from
   users during a GR.  This may negatively influence the experiences of
   users.

   3.  Because during a GR, backup routers may have to wait for a
   relatively long period.  During this period, any newly occurred
   issues (e.g., the failure of the data plain of the restarted router)
   may be difficult to be detected in time.  To address this issue,
   additional failure detecting approach needs to be adopted.  TBD.

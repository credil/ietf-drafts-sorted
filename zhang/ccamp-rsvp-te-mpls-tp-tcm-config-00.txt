1. Introduction 

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is being developed by ITU-T and 
   IETF. The MPLS-TP data plane framework and requirements are described 
   in [TP-FRWK] and [RFC5654], and the [TP-CP-FRWK] provides the 
   framework to support dynamic provisioning of MPLS-TP transport paths 
   via control plane. 

   The MPLS-TP Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM), which 
   is defined in [TP-OAM], is one of the most important and fundamental 
   functionalities in MPLS-TP. The OAM functionality is not only applied 
   on a transport path granularity, but also applied on arbitrary parts 
   of the transport path, defined as Tandem Connections. For the latter 
   case, a Tandem Connection Monitoring (TCM) is implemented by creating 
   a path segment tunnel that has a 1:1 association with the path 
   segment of the transport path that is to be uniquely monitored. 
   Therefore, the LSP is nested into the TCM path segment tunnel. 

   In case of TCM configuration using GMPLS control plane, the TCM path 
   segment tunnel needs to be created on an in-service LSP, which is not 
   supported in the current GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling.

3. Requirements of TCM Configuration 

3.1. Introduction of TCM Path Segment Tunnel 

   This sub-section is informational which introduces the TCM and LSP 
   Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring in the MPLS-TP data plane. 

   As described in [TP-OAM], TCM is implemented by LSP Path Segment 
   Tunnel Monitoring which can be deployed to monitor the behavior of a 
   part of an LSP.

               Figure 1 - Example of Path Segment Monitoring 

   Figure 1 shows an example of TCM. Assume that there is an LSP passing 
   through node A, B, C, D and E. A path segment tunnel between node B 
   and D will be created when the operator wants to configure a TCM to

   monitor this path segment. The path segment tunnel has a 1:1 
   association with the LSP which is nested into this tunnel. In other 
   words, the label stacking is performed between B and D, where the 
   inner layer label is corresponded with the LSP and the outer layer 
   label is corresponded with the tunnel. 

   Since the data packets of the LSP and the OAM packets for path 
   segment monitoring are using the same outer layer labels (i.e., the 
   tunnel labels), the LSP and the OAM session can be associated. 

3.2. Requirements of TCM Configuration Using RSVP-TE 

   In most cases, the path segment tunnel for TCM is created when the 
   LSP is in service. When the network operator wants to monitor a 
   certain part of the LSP, a path segment tunnel needs to be set up by 
   RSVP-TE if the GMPLS control plane is in use. 

   Figure 2 and 3 show the label forwarding tables on each node that the 
   LSP pass through before and after the creation of the tunnel. In the 
   example shown in Figure 3, in order to create the TCM tunnel, the TCM 
   source node B needs to create a new label forwarding entry with two 
   labels, in which the in-label at the TCM destination node D of the 
   LSP (i.e., the label "L3") is treated as the inner layer out-label. 
   The current RSVP-TE can not support creation of such label forwarding 
   entry and creation of TCM tunnel on an existing LSP, so RSVP-TE needs 
   to be extended.

   The basic requirements of setting up path segment tunnel on an LSP 
   for TCM by GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling include: 

      -  No Disruption of User Traffic on the LSP. 

      -  The path segment tunnel MUST pass through exactly the same 
         route as the LSP segment to be monitored. 

      -  No extra bandwidth required. Since the tunnel and the LSP 
         segment have a 1:1 relationship, the bandwidth of the tunnel is 
         exactly the same as the LSP. Therefore, when setting up such 
         tunnel, no extra bandwidth is required to be reserved. 

    

4. Procedure of TCM Configuration 

   When there is a need to monitor a part of an existing LSP between two 
   nodes (i.e., the TCM source node and the TCM destination node), the

   network operator can instruct the TCM source node to perform the TCM 
   configuration. The GMPLS signaling is used to set up an RSVP-TE 
   session for the TCM tunnel between TCM source node and destination 
   node.  

    

4.1. Path Segment Tunnel Creation 

   If the OAM MEP function can be supported, the TCM source node sends a 
   PATH message node by node along the LSP until the TCM destination 
   node. The ERO, which indicates the same route as the LSP segment to 
   be monitored, is necessary to be carried in this PATH message. The 
   tunnel sender address and the tunnel end point address in the PATH 
   message indicate the TCM source node and the TCM destination node. 

   Additionally, in order to perform bandwidth sharing between the TCM 
   tunnel and the LSP segment to be monitored, the PATH message for the 
   TCM tunnel should indicate using Share Explicit (SE) reservation 
   style and indicate which LSP to be monitored. Therefore, the 
   information of source and destination node IDs and the LSP ID of the 
   LSP to be monitored is needed to be carried in the PATH message. 

   A new TCM_CONFIGURATION object, as described in Session 5, is 
   introduced into the PATH message to carry this information. 

   If the OAM MEP function can be supported, the TCM destination node 
   responds a RESV message along the LSP until to the TCM source node. 
   Each node on the TCM tunnel performs a normal label distribution 
   procedure for the TCM tunnel and uses the SE style to share bandwidth 
   resources with the LSP.  

   Additionally, the TCM source node needs to use the in-label of the 
   LSP at the TCM destination node (i.e., L3 in figure 2 and 3) to 
   create the label forwarding entry for the TCM tunnel. But the TCM 
   source node may not have this label information because the Label 
   recording may not be performed in the LSP (i.e., the Label_Recording 
   flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object of the LSP is not set). 
   Therefore, the TCM destination node needs to include this in-label  
   in the RESV message. This label will be forwarded to the TCM source 
   node by the RESV messages sent by the intermediate nodes. This label 
   can be also carried in the TCM CONFIGUARION object. See Session 5 for 
   the detailed format of this object. 

   In Figure 3, for the TCM source node B, three labels are obtained: 

   -  L3 from the downstream RESV message; 
 
 
Zhang                   Expires January 2011                   [Page 6] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-rsvp-te-mpls-tp-tcm-config-00.txt           July 2010 


   -  The label of the TCM tunnel allocate by the downstream node (i.e., 
      L5 in figure 2 and 3) from the downstream RESV message; 

   -  The in-label of the LSP on the TCM source node (i.e., L1 in figure 
      2 and 3) from the forwarding entry related to the LSP on itself. 

   Then the TCM source node can creates a new label forwarding entry 
   which indicates that for the received data packet with a label of L1, 
   the label is replaced to two layer label, where the inner layer label 
   is L3 and the outer label is L5. 

   At last, the TCM source node enables this new created label 
   forwarding entry and disables the old one for the LSP, so that the 
   TCM tunnel is created and is ready for use. 

    

4.2. LSP Rerouting in control plane 

   After setting up the TCM tunnel, the TCM tunnel is treated to be one 
   hop in the viewpoint of the original LSP. In other words, the route 
   of the LSP is changed so that a rerouting procedure is necessary to 
   be performed in the control plane. A Notify message is sent from the 
   TCM source node to the source node of the LSP to inform the change of 
   the route, so that the source node of the LSP can refresh the LSP 
   along the new route in the next refreshing periods. 

    

4.3. OAM Configuration 

   After setting up the TCM tunnel, the OAM function can be initiated. 
   [OAM-CFG] describes the procedure of OAM configuration using GMPLS 
   control plane. 

    

5. RSVP-TE Extension 

   A new TCM_CONFIGURATION object is introduced to carry the TCM related 
   information. The object class is TBD.

 Internet-Draft Management Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol October 2009 
     

    In this document, we propose a simplified VRRP protocol called the 
    Slave Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (SVRRP).The design 
    objective of SVRRP is to specify an election protocol that 
    dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of 
    the SVRRP routers on a LAN, which is exactly as same as that of VRRP. 
    However, SVRRP executions do not exchange signaling packets and need 
    the assistance of VRRP to perform their functionality appropriately. 
    This approach can be used to improve the efficiency of VRRP routers 
    in certain scenarios.

 1. Introduction 

    In many typical scenarios (e.g., a VRRP router supporting multiple 
    VLANs), a VRRP router needs to backup multiple virtual routes (VRs) 
    simultaneously. In order to maintain the state of a VRRP instance 
    (execution) for the election of a VR, the router needs to exchange 
    VRRP signaling packets with other routers involved in the same 
    selection. The bandwidth consumed by the router in transporting VRRP 
    signaling packets is proportional to the number of the VRs which it 
    supports. In order to improve the efficiency of the VRRP routers in 
    such scenarios, a simplified VRRP, called Slave VRRP (SVRRP) is 
    proposed. SVRRP need not exchange signaling messages. Actually, the 
    state of a SVRRP instance is determined by another VRRP instance 
    (which is referred to as a MVRRP instance in this case). Therefore, 
    a VRRP router executing SVRRP needs in addition to execute MVRRP. 
    This solution is based on the fact that the states of a set of VRRP 
    instances located on a VRRP router are always identical and

 3. Motivating Scenario 

    Figure 1 illustrates a motivating scenario where multiple hosts 
    belonging to different VLANs connect to two VRRP routers (Router1 
    and Router2) through a switch. The packets from the hosts are routed 
    to a same physical interface (e.g., Interface1) of the master VRRP 
    router (e.g., Router1). Moreover, the physical interface is divided 
    into multiple sub-interfaces; each is used to deal with the packets 
    in a VLAN.

    Because in principle a VR acts as a default router for hosts on a 
    shared LAN, each of the routers should generate a VRRP instance for 
    every VLAN respectively. As mentioned previously, a VRRP instance 
    needs to maintain a state machine and periodically exchange 
    signaling packets with others in the same VRRP back group. When the 
    number of VRRP instances supported by a VRRP router is large, the 
    resource ( e.g, bandwidth, CPU, memory )occupied in transporting and 
    processing signaling packets may influence the performance of the 
    router negatively.

                       Figure 1. Motivating Scenario 

    In this scenario, all the VRs share the same physical interface; the 
    states of the VRRP instances located on a same VRRP router are 
    always identical and change in a concurrent way. Therefore, it can 
    be effective to select a VRRP BG as the MVRRP BG while the instances 
    in other VRRP BGs are implemented with SVRRP. The state of a MVRRP 
    instance is shared by the SVRRP instances on the same VRRP router, 
    and any change in the state of the MVRRP instance can trigger 
    identical changes in the states of the corresponding SVRRP instances. 
    Therefore, Router1 and Router2 only need to exchange VRRP signaling 
    packets for the MVRRP BG, irrespective of how may VRs they are 
    supporting.

    4.2.  State Descriptions 

    In the state descriptions below, the state names are identified by 
    {state-name}, and the packets are identified by all upper case 
    characters.  

    There are two key events in the SVRRP state machine, the Startup 
    event and the Shutdown event. A Startup event arises when the 
    associated interface is available and the associate MVRRP instance 
    is in the {Backup} or the {Master} state. A Shutdown event arises 
    when the interface is unavailable or the associated MVRRP instance 
    is in the {Initialize} state. 

    4.2.1.  Initialize 

    A SVRRP instance in this state just waits for a Startup event. If a 
    Startup event is received, then: 

       -  If State of MVRRP is {Master} 

         -  If broadcast_timer is inactive, then: 

             o set broadcast_timer to broadcast_interval.   

             endif 

          o  Broadcast a gratuitous ARP request containing the virtual 

             router MAC address for each IP address associated with the 

             virtual router.

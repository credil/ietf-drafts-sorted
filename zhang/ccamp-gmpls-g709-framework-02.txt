1. Introduction 

   OTN has become a mainstream layer 1 technology for the transport 
   network. Operators want to introduce control plane capabilities based 
   on Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) to OTN networks, 
   to realize the benefits associated with a high-function control plane 
   (e.g., improved network resiliency, resource usage efficiency, etc.). 

   GMPLS extends MPLS to encompass time division multiplexing (TDM) 
   networks (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and G.709 sub-lambda), lambda 
   switching optical networks, and spatial switching (e.g., incoming 
   port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber). The GMPLS architecture is 
   provided in [RFC3945], signaling function and Resource ReserVation 
   Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions are described in

   [RFC3471] and [RFC3473], routing and OSPF extensions are described in 
   [RFC4202] and [RFC4203], and the Link Management Protocol (LMP) is 
   described in [RFC4204].  

   The GMPLS protocol suite including provision [RFC4328] provides the 
   mechanisms for basic GMPLS control of OTN networks based on the 2003 
   revision of the G.709 specification [G709-V1]. Later revisions of the 
   G.709 specification [G709-V3] have included some new features; for 
   example, various multiplexing structures, two types of Tributary 
   Slots (i.e., 1.25Gbps and 2.5Gbps), and extension of the Optical Data 
   Unit (ODU) ODUj definition to include the ODUflex function. 

   This document reviews relevant aspects of OTN technology evolution 
   that affect the GMPLS control plane protocols and examines why and 
   how to update the mechanisms described in [RFC4328]. This document 
   additionally provides a framework for the GMPLS control of OTN 
   networks and includes a discussion of the implication for the use of 
   the Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655]. 

   For the purposes of the control plane the OTN can be considered as 
   being comprised of sub-wavelength (ODU) and wavelength (OCh) layers. 
   This document focuses on the control of the sub-wavelength layer, 
   with control of the wavelength layer considered out of the scope. 
   Please refer to [WSON-Frame] for further information about the 
   wavelength layer.

   ODUflex: Flexible ODU. A flexible ODUk can have any bit rate and a 
   bit rate tolerance up to 100 ppm. 

3. G.709 Optical Transport Network (OTN) 

   This section provides an informative overview of those aspects of the 
   OTN impacting control plane protocols.  This overview is based on the 
   ITU-T Recommendations that contain the normative definition of the 
   OTN. Technical details regarding OTN architecture and interfaces are 
   provided in the relevant ITU-T Recommendations. 

   Specifically, [ITU-T-G.872] describes the functional architecture of 
   optical transport networks providing optical signal transmission, 
   multiplexing, routing, supervision, performance assessment, and 
   network survivability.  [G709-V1] defines the interfaces of the 
   optical transport network to be used within and between subnetworks 
   of the optical network.  With the evolution and deployment of OTN 
   technology many new features have been specified in ITU-T 
   recommendations, including for example, new ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 and 
   ODUflex containers as described in [G709-V3]. 

    
3.1. OTN Layer Network 

   The simplified signal hierarchy of OTN is shown in Figure 1, which 
   illustrates the layers that are of interest to the control plane. 
   Other layers below OCh (e.g. Optical Transmission Section - OTS) are 
   not included in this Figure. The full signal hierarchy is provided in 
   [G709-V3].

   Client signals are mapped into ODUj containers. These ODUj containers 
   are multiplexed onto the OTU/OCh. The individual OTU/OCh signals are 
   combined in the Optical Multiplex Section (OMS) using WDM 
   multiplexing, and this aggregated signal provides the link between 
   the nodes. 

   3.1.1 Client signal mapping 
    
   The client signals are mapped into a Low Order (LO) ODUj. Appendix A 
   gives more information about LO ODU. 

   The current values of j defined in [G709-V3] are: 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 4, 
   Flex. The approximate bit rates of these signals are defined in 
   [G709-V3] and are reproduced in Tables 1 and 2.

                      Table 2 ODU types and tolerance 
    
   One of two options are for mapping client signals into ODUflex 
   depending on the client signal type:  
   -  Circuit clients are proportionally wrapped. Thus the bit rate and         
       tolerance are defined by the client signal. 

   -  Packet clients are mapped using the Generic Framing Procedure 
   (GFP). [G709-V3] recommends that the bit rate should be set to an 
   integer multiplier of the High Order (HO) Optical Channel Physical 
   Unit (OPU) OPUk Tributary Slot (TS) rate, the tolerance should be +/- 
   20ppm, and the bit rate should be determined by the node that 
   performs the mapping. 

   3.1.1.1 ODUj types and parameters 
    
   When ODUj connections are setup, two types of information should be 
   conveyed in a connection request:  

   (a)End to end: 
   Client payload type (e.g. STM64; Ethernet etc.) 

   Bit rate and tolerance:  Note for j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 4 this 
   information may be carried as an enumerated type.  For the ODUflex 
   the actual bit rate and tolerance must be provided.

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-02.txt             February 2010 
    

   (b)Hop by hop: 
   TS assignment and port number carried by the Multiplex Structure 
   Identifier (MSI) bytes as described in section 3.1.2. 

   3.1.2 Multiplexing ODUj onto Links 
    
   The links between the switching nodes are provided by one or more 
   wavelengths.  Each wavelength carries one OCh, which carries one OTU, 
   which carries one OPU.  Since all of these signals have a 1:1:1 
   relationship, we only refer to the OTU for clarity.  The ODUjs are 
   mapped into the Tributary Slots (TS) of the OTUk.  Note that in the 
   case where j=k the ODUj is mapped into the OTU/OCh without 
   multiplexing.   

   The initial versions of G.709 [G709-V1] only provided a single TS 
   granularity, nominally 2.5Gb/s.  Amendment 3 [G709-V3], approved in 
   2009, added an additional TS granularity, nominally 1.25Gb/s. The 
   number and type of TSs provided by each of the currently identified 
   OTUk is provided below: 

       2.5Gb/s  1.25Gb/s  Nominal Bit rate  
   OTU1    1      2         2.5Gb/s 
   OTU2    4      8          10Gb/s 
   OTU3   16     32          40Gb/s 
   OTU4   --     80         100Gb/s 
    
   To maintain backwards compatibility while providing the ability to 
   interconnect nodes that support 1.25Gb/s TS at one end of a link and 
   2.5Gb/s TS at the other, the 'new' equipment will fall back to the 
   use of a 2.5Gb/s TS if connected to legacy equipment.  This 
   information is carried in band by the payload type. 

   The actual bit rate of the TS in an OTUk depends on the value of k.  
   Thus the number of TS occupied by an ODUj may vary depending on the 
   values of j and k.  For example an ODU2e uses 9 TS in an OTU3 but 
   only 8 in an OTU4. Examples of the number of TS used for various 
   cases are provided below: 

   -  ODU0 into ODU1, ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4 multiplexing with 1,25Gbps TS 
       granularity  
      o ODU0 occupies 1 of the 2, 8, 32 or 80 TS for ODU1, ODU2, ODU3 or 
        ODU4

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-02.txt             February 2010 
    

   -  ODU1 into ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4 multiplexing with 1,25Gbps TS 
       granularity  
      o ODU1 occupies 2 of the 8, 32 or 80 TS for ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4  
    
   -  ODU1 into ODU2, ODU3 multiplexing with 2.5Gbps TS granularity  
      o ODU1 occupies 1 of the 4 or 16 TS for ODU2 or ODU3  
    
   -  ODU2 into ODU3 or ODU4 multiplexing with 1.25Gbps TS granularity  
      o ODU2 occupies 8 of the 32 or 80 TS for ODU3 or ODU4 
    
   -  ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing with 2.5Gbps TS granularity  
      o ODU2 occupies 4 of the 16 TS for ODU3  
    
   -  ODU3 into ODU4 multiplexing with 1.25Gbps TS granularity  
      o ODU3 occupies 31 of the 80 TS for ODU4  
    
   -  ODUflex into ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4 multiplexing with 1.25Gbps TS 
       granularity  
      o ODUflex occupies n of the 8, 32 or 80 TS for ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4 
        (n <= Total TS numbers of ODUk)  
    
   -  ODU2e into ODU3 or ODU4 multiplexing with 1.25Gbps TS granularity  
      o ODU2e occupies 9 of the 32 TS for ODU3 or 8 of the 80 TS for 
        ODU4 
    
   In general the mapping of an ODUj (including ODUflex) into the OTUk 
   TSs is determined locally, and it can also be explicitly controlled 
   by a specific entity (e.g., head end, NMS) through Explicit Label 
   Control [RFC3473]. 

   3.1.2.1 Link Parameters 

   Per [RFC4201], each OTU can be treated as a component link of a link 
   bundle. The available capacity between nodes is the sum of the 
   available capacity on the OTUs that interconnect the nodes. This 
   total capacity is represented as the capacity of a link bundle.  

   Note that there will typically be more than one OTU between a pair of 
   nodes so that the available capacity will typically be distributed 
   across multiple OTUs. Thus, in order to be able to determine the 
   maximum payload that can be carried on a bundled link, the link state 
   advertisement must also provide the largest number of TSes available 
   on any one component OTU.

   In order to compute the lowest cost path for a ODUj connection 
   request the critical parameters that need to be provided (for the 
   purposes of routing) are: 

   -  Number of TS 

   -  Maximum number of TS available for a LSP (i.e., Maximum LSP 
   Bandwidth) 

   -  Bit rate of the TS. (Note: This may be efficiently encoded as a 
   two integers representing the value of k and the granularity.) 

   3.1.2.2 Tributary Port Number Assignment 

   When multiplexing an ODUj into a HO ODUk (k>j), G.709 specifies the 
   information that has to be transported in-band in order to allow for 
   correct demultiplexing. This information, known as Multiplex 
   Structure Information (MSI), is transported in the OPUk overhead and 
   is organized as a set of entries, with one entry for each HO ODUj 
   tributary slot.  The information carried by each entry is: 

   Payload Type:  the type of the transported payload  

   Tributary Port Number (TPN):  the port number of the ODUj transported 
   by the HO ODUk. The TPN is the same for all the tributary slots 
   assigned to the transport of the same ODUj instance. 

   For example, an ODU2 carried by a HO ODU3 is described by 4 entries 
   in the OPU3 overhead when the Tributary Slot (TS) size is 2.5 Gbit/s, 
   and by 8 entries when the TS size is 1.25 Gbit/s.    

   The MSI information inserted in OPU3 overhead by the source of the HO 
   ODUk trail is checked by the sink of the HO ODUk trail.  G.709 
   default behavior requires that the multiplexing structure of the HO 
   ODUk be provided by means of pre-provisioned MSI information, termed 
   expectedMSI.  The sink of the HO ODU trail checks the complete 
   content of the MSI information (including the TPN) that was received 
   in-band, termed acceptedMSI, against the expectedMSI.  If the 
   acceptedMSI  is different from the expectedMSI, then the traffic is 
   dropped and a payload mismatch alarm is generated.  

   Note that the values of the TPN MUST be either agreed between the 
   source and the sink of the HO ODU trail  either via control plane 
   signaling or provisioning by the management plane.

4. Connection management in OTN  

   As [ITU-T-G.872] described, OTN-based transport network equipment is 
   concerned with control of connectivity of ODU paths and optical 
   channels and not with control of connectivity of the client layer. 
   This document focuses on the connection management of ODU paths.  The 
   management of OCh paths is described in [WSON-FRAME]. 

   Current [ITU-T-G.872] considers the ODU as a set of layers in the 
   same way as SDH has been modeled.  However, recent progress within 
   the ITU-T on OTN architecture includes an agreement to update this 
   Recommendation to model the ODU  as a single layer network with the 
   bit rate as a parameter of links and connections. This will allow the 
   links and nodes to be viewed in a single topology as a common set of 
   resources that are available to provide ODUj connections independent 
   of the value of j. Note that when the bit rate of ODUj is less than 
   the server bit rate, ODUj connections are supported by HO-ODU (which 
   has a one-to-one relationship with the OTU).  

   From an ITU-T perspective, the service layer is represented by the LO 
   ODU and the connection topology is represented by that of the server 
   layer; i.e., the OTU [corresponding to HO-ODU in case of multiplexing 
   or to LO-ODU in case of direct mapping] which has the same topology 
   as that of the OCh layer. The server layer topology is based on that 
   of the OTU, and could be provided by a point-to-point optical 
   connection, flexible optical connection that is fully in the optical 
   domain, flexible optical connection involving hybrid sub-
   lambda/lambda nodes involving 3R, etc.   

   The HO-ODU/OTU and OCh layers should be visible in a single 
   topological representation of the network, and from a logical 
   perspective, the HO ODU/OTU and OCh may be considered as the same 
   logical, switchable entity.   

   The remainder of this document assumes that the revision of G.872 
   will be made. The document will be updated to keep it in line with 
   the new revision of G.872 when it is consented for publication. 

4.1. Connection management of the ODU 

   LO ODUj can be either mapped into the OTUk signal (j = k), or 
   multiplexed with other LO ODUjs into an OTUk (j < k), and the OTUk is 
   mapped into an OCh. See Appendix A for more information. 

   From the perspective of control plane, there are two kinds of network 
   topology to be considered.

   (1) ODU layer  

   In this case, the ODU links are presented between adjacent OTN nodes, 
   which is illustrated in Figure 2. In this layer there are ODU links 
   with a variety of TSes available, and nodes that are ODXCs. Lo ODU 
   connections can be setup based on the network topology.

   If an ODUj connection is requested between Node C and Node E 
   routing/path computation must select a path that has the required 
   number of TS available and that offers the lowest cost.  Signaling is 
   then invoked to set up the path and to provide the information (e.g., 
   selected TS) required by each transit node to allow the configuration 
   of the ODUj to OTUk mapping (j = k) or multiplexing (j < k),  and 
   demapping (j = k) or demultiplexing (j < k).     

   (2)ODU layer with OCh switching capability 

   In this case, the OTN nodes interconnect with wavelength switched 
   node (e.g., ROADM,OXC) that are capable of OCh switching, which is 
   illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure 4. There are ODU layer and OCh 
   layer, so it is simply a MLN. OCh connections may be created on 
   demand, which is described in section 5.1. 

   In this case, an operator may choose to allow the underlined OCh 
   layer to be visible to the ODU routing/path computation process in 
   which case the topology would be as shown in Figure 4. In Figure 3 
   below, instead, a cloud representing OCH capable switching nodes is 
   represented. In Figure 3, the operator choice is to hide the real RWA 
   network topology.

   In Figure 4, the cloud of previous figure is substitute by the real 
   topology. The nodes f,g,h are nodes with OCH switching capability. 

   In the examples (i.e., Figure 3 and Figure 4), we have considered the 
   case in which LO-ODUj connections are supported by OCh connection, 
   and the case in which the supporting underlying connection can be 
   also made by a combination of HO-ODU/OCh connections.  

   In this case, the ODU routing/path selection process will request an 
   HO-ODU/OCh connection between node C to node E from the RWA domain. 
   The connection will appear at ODU level as a Forwarding Adjacency, 
   which will be used to create the ODU connection.

5. GMPLS/PCE Implications 

   The purpose of this section is to provide a framework for extensions 
   of the current GMPLS protocol suite and the PCE applications and 
   protocols to encompass OTN enhancements and connection management. 

5.1. Implications for LSP Hierarchy with GMPLS TE 

   The path computation for LO ODU connection request is based on the 
   topology of ODU layer, including OCh layer visibility.  

   The OTN path computation can be divided into two layers. One layer is 
   OCh/OTUk, the other is LO ODUj. [RFC4206] defines the mechanisms to 
   accomplish creating the hierarchy of LSPs. The LSP management of 
   multiple layers in OTN can follow the procedures defined in [RFC4206] 
   and related MLN drafts. 

   As discussed in section 4, the route path computation for OCh is in 
   the scope of WSON [WSON-Frame]. Therefore, this document only 
   considers ODU layer for LO ODU connection request. 

5.2. Implications for GMPLS Signaling 

   The signaling function and Resource reSerVation Protocol-Traffic 
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions are described in [RFC3471] and [RFC 
   3473]. For OTN-specific control, [RFC4328] defines signaling 
   extensions to support G.709 Optical Transport Networks Control as 
   defined in [G709-V1].  

   As described in Section 2, [G709-V3] introduced some new features 
   that include the ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 and ODUflex containers. The 
   mechanisms defined in [RFC4328] do not support such new OTN features, 
   and protocol extensions will be necessary to allow them to be 
   controlled by a GMPLS control plane. 

   5.2.1. Identifying OTN signals 

   [RFC4328] defines the LSP Encoding Type, the Switching Type and the 
   Generalized Protocol Identifier (Generalized-PID) constituting the 
   common part of the Generalized Label Request. The G.709 Traffic 
   Parameters are also defined in [RFC4328].  The following new signal 
   types have been added since [RFC4328] was published: 

   (1)New signal types of sub-lambda layer 

      Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUj):

           ODU0 

           ODU2e 

           ODU4 

           ODUflex 

   (2)A new Tributary Slot (TS) granularity (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) 

   (3)Signal type with variable bandwidth: 

      ODUflex has a variable bandwidth/bit rate BR and a bit rate 
      tolerance T. As described above the (node local) mapping process 
      must be aware of the bit rate and tolerance of the ODUj being 
      multiplexed in order to select the correct number of TS and the 
      fixed/variable stuffing bytes. Therefore, bit rate and bit rate 
      tolerance should be carried in the Traffic Parameter in the 
      signaling of connection setup request. 

   (4)Extended multiplexing hierarchy (For example, ODU0 into OTU2 
        multiplexing (with 1,25Gbps TS granularity).) 

   So the encoding provided in [RFC4328] needs to be extended to support 
   all the signal types and related mapping and multiplexing with all 
   kinds of tributary slots. Moreover, the extensions should consider 
   the extensibility to match future evolvement of OTN.  

   For item (1) and (3), new traffic parameters may need to be extended 
   in signaling message; 

   For item (2) and (4), new label should be defined to carry the exact 
   TS allocation information related to the extended multiplexing 
   hierarchy. 

   5.2.2. Tributary Port Number 

   The tributary port number may be assigned locally by the node at the 
   (traffic) ingress end of the link and in this case as described above 
   must be conveyed to the far end of the link as a "transparent" 
   parameter i.e. the control plane does not need to understand this 
   information. The TPN may also be assigned by the control plane as a 
   part of path computation.

5.3. Implications for GMPLS Routing 

   The path computation process should select a suitable route for a 
   ODUj connection request. In order to compute the lowest cost path it 
   must evaluate the number (and availability) of tributary slots on 
   each candidate link.  The routing protocol should be extended to 
   convey some information to represent ODU TE topology.  As described 
   above the number of tributary slots (on a link bundle), the bandwidth 
   of the TS and the maximum number that are available to convey a 
   single ODUj must be provided. 

   GMPLS Routing [RFC4202] defines Interface Switching Capability 
   Descriptor of TDM which can be used for ODU. However, some other 
   issues should also be considered which are discussed below. 

5.3.1. Requirement for conveying Interface Switching Capability specific 
   information 

   Interface Switching Capability Descriptors present a new constraint   
   for LSP path computation. [RFC4203] defines the switching capability 
   and related Maximum LSP Bandwidth and the Switching Capability 
   specific information. When the Switching Capability field is TDM the 
   Switching Capability specific information field includes Minimum LSP 
   Bandwidth, an indication whether the interface supports Standard or 
   Arbitrary SONET/SDH, and padding. So routing protocol should be 
   extended when TDM is ODU type to support representation of ODU 
   switching information. 

   As discussed in section 3.1.2, many different types of ODUj can be 
   multiplexed into the same OTUk. For example, both ODU0 and ODU1 may 
   be multiplexed into ODU2. An OTU link may support one or more types 
   of ODUj signals. The routing protocol should be extended to carry 
   this multiplexing capability. Furthermore, one type of ODUj can be 
   multiplexed to an OTUk using different tributary slot granularity. 
   For example, ODU1 can be multiplexed into ODU2 with either 2.5Gbps TS 
   granularity or 1.25G TS granularity. The routing protocol should be 
   extended to carry which TS granularity supported by the ODU interface. 

   Moreover, the bit rate (i.e., bandwidth) of TS can be determined by 
   the TS granularity and link type of the TE link. For example, the 
   bandwidth of a 1.25G TS without NJO (Negative Justification 
   Opportunity) in an OTU2 is about 1.249409620 Gbps, while the 
   bandwidth of a 1.25G TS without NJO in an OTU3 is about 1.254703729 
   Gbps. So The routing protocol should be extended to carry the TE link 
   type (OTUk/HO ODUk).

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g709-framework-02.txt             February 2010 
    

   In OTN networks, it is simpler to use the number of Tributary Slots 
   for the bandwidth accounting. For example, Total bandwidth of the TE 
   link, Unreserved Bandwidth of the TE link and the Maximum LSP 
   Bandwidth can be accounted through the number of Tributary Slots 
   (e.g., the total number of the Tributary Slots of the TE link, the 
   unreserved Tributary Slots of the TE link, Maximum Tributary Slots 
   for an LSP). Thus, the routing protocol should be extended to carry 
   the Tributary Slots information related to bandwidth of the TE link. 

5.4. Implications for Link Management Protocol (LMP) 

   As discussed in section 5.3, Path computation needs to know the 
   interface switching capability of links. The switching capability of 
   two ends of the link may be different, so the link capability of two 
   ends should be correlated.  

   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] provides a control plane   
   protocol for exchanging and correlating link capabilities. 

   It is not necessary to use LMP to correlate link-end capabilities if 
   the information is available from another source such as management 
   configuration or automatic discovery/negotiation within the data 
   plane. 

   Note that LO ODU type information can be, in principle, discovered by 
   routing. Since in certain case, routing is not present (e.g. UNI case) 
   we need to extend link management protocol capabilities to cover this 
   aspect. In case of routing presence, the discovering procedure by LMP 
   could also be optional.  

   5.4.1. Correlating the Granularity of the TS 

   As discussed in section 3.1.2, the two ends of a link may support 
   different TS granularity. In order to allow interconnection the node 
   with 1.25Gb/s granularity must fall back to 2.5Gb/s granularity. 

   Therefore, it is necessary for the two ends of a link to correlate 
   the granularity of the TS.  This ensures that both ends of the link 
   advertise consistent capabilities (for routing) and ensures that 
   viable connections are established. 

   5.4.2.  Correlating the Supported LO ODU Signal Types 

   Many new ODU signal types have been introduced [G709-V3], such as 
   ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex. It is possible that equipment does not 
   support all the LO ODU signal types introduced by those new standards 
   or drafts. If one end of a link can not support a certain LO ODU

   signal type, the link cannot be selected to carry such type of LO ODU 
   connection. 

   Therefore, it is necessary for the two ends of an HO ODU link to 
   correlate which types of LO ODU can be supported by the link. After 
   correlating, the capability information can be flooded by IGP, so 
   that the correct path for an ODU connection can be calculated. 

5.5. Implications for Path Computation Elements 

   [PCE-APS] describes the requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in 
   order to establish GMPLS LSP. PCE needs to consider the GMPLS TE 
   attributes appropriately once a PCC or another PCE requests a path 
   computation. The TE attributes which can be contained in the path 
   calculation request message from the PCC or the PCE defined in 
   [RFC5440] includes switching capability, encoding type, signal type, 
   etc. 

   As described in section 5.2.1, new signal types and new signals with 
   variable bandwidth information need to be carried in the extended 
   signaling message of path setup. For the same consideration, PCECP 
   also has a desire to be extended to carry the new signal type and 
   related variable bandwidth information when a PCC requests a path 
   computation.  

6. Security Considerations 

   The use of control plane protocols for signaling, routing, and path 
   computation opens an OTN to security threats through attacks on those 
   protocols. The data plane technology for an OTN does not introduce 
   any specific vulnerabilities, and so the control plane may be secured 
   using the mechanisms defined for the protocols discussed. 

   For further details of the specific security measures refer to the 
   documents that define the protocols ([RFC3473], [RFC4203], [RFC4205], 
   [RFC4204], and [RFC5440]). [GMPLS-SEC] provides an overview of 
   security vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for the GMPLS 
   control plane. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document makes not requests for IANA action.

   comments.

   APPENDIX A: Description of LO ODU terminology and ODU connection 
   examples. 

   This appendix provides a description of LO ODU terminology and ODU 
   connection examples. This section is not normative which is just a 
   reference in order to facilitate quicker understanding of text. 

   In order to transmit client signal, the LO ODU connection must be 
   created first. From the perspective of [G709-V3], there are two types 
   of LO ODU:   

   (1) A LO ODUj mapped into an OTUk. In this case, the server layer of 
   this LO ODU is an OTUk. For example, if a STM-16 signal is 
   encapsulated into ODU1, and then ODU1 is mapped into OTU1, the ODU1   
   is a LO ODU.  

   (2) A LO ODUj multiplexed into a HO ODUk (j < k)  occupying several 
   TSs. In this case, the server layer of this LO ODU is a HO ODUk. For 
   example, if ODU1 is multiplexed into ODU2, and ODU2 is mapped into 
   OTU2, the ODU1 is LO ODU and ODU2 is HO ODU.  

   The LO ODUj represents the container transporting a client of the OTN 
   that is either directly mapped into an OTUk (k = j) or multiplexed 
   into a server HO ODUk (k > j)container. Consequently, the HO ODUk 
   represents the entity transporting a multiplex of LO ODUj tributary 
   signals in its OPUk area. 

   In the case of LO ODUj mapped into an OTUk (k = j) directly, Figure 5 
   give an example of this kind of LO ODU connection. 

   In Figure 5, The LO ODUj is switched at the intermediate ODXC node. 
   OCh and OTUk are associated with each other. From the viewpoint of 
   connection management, the management of OTUk is similar with OCh. LO 
   ODUj and OCh/OTUk have client/server relationships.  

   For example, one LO ODU1 connection can be setup between Node A and 
   Node C. This LO ODU1 connection is to be supported by OCh/OTU1 
   connections, which are to be set up between Node A and Node B and 
   between Node B and Node C. LO ODU1 can be mapped into OTU1 at Node A,

   demapped from it in Node B, switched at Node B, and then mapped into 
   the next OTU1 and demapped from this OTU1 at Node C.

                   Figure 5 Connection of LO ODUj (1) 

   In the case of LO ODUj multiplexing into HO ODUk, Figure 6 gives an 
   example of this kind of LO ODU connection. 

   In Figure 6, OCh, OTUk, HO ODUk are associated with each other. The 
   LO ODUj is multiplexed/de-multiplexed into/from the HO ODU at each 
   ODXC node and switched at each ODXC node (i.e. trib port to line port, 
   line card to line port, line port to trib port). From the viewpoint 
   of connection management, the management of these HO ODUk and OTUk 
   are similar to OCh. LO ODUj and OCh/OTUk/HO ODUk have client/server 
   relationships. when a LO ODU connection is setup, it will be using 
   the existing HO ODUk (/OTUk/OCh) connections which have been set up. 
   Those HO ODUk connections provide LO ODU links, of which the LO ODU 
   connection manager requests a link connection to support the LO ODU 
   connection.  

   For example, one HO ODU2 (/OTU2/OCh) connection can be setup between 
   Node A and Node B, another HO ODU3 (/OTU3/OCh) connection can be 
   setup between Node B and Node C. LO ODU1 can be generated at Node A, 
   switched to one of the 10G line ports and multiplexed into a HO ODU2 
   at Node A, demultiplexed from the HO ODU2 at Node B, switched at Node 
   B to one of the 40G line ports and multiplexed into HO ODU3 at Node B, 
   demultiplexed from HO ODU3 at Node C and switched to its LO ODU1 
   terminating port at Node C.

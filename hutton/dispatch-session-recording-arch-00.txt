    An Architecture for Media Recording using the Session Initiation
                                Protocol
            draft-hutton-dispatch-session-recording-arch-00

Abstract

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document describes architectures for
   deploying session recording solutions in an environment which is
   based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This is an initial
   draft which explores possible architectural solutions and has many
   open issues.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant mechanisms.


2.  Definitions

   Recording Server (RS):  A Recording Server (RS) is a SIP User Agent
   (UA) that is a specialized media server or collector that acts as the
   sink of the recorded media.  An Recording Server is typically
   implemented as a multi-port device that is capable of receiving media
   from several sources simultaneously.  An Recording Server is
   typically also the sink of the Media Recording Metadata.

   Recording Client (RC):  A Recording Client (RC) is a SIP User Agent
   (UA) that acts as the source of the recorded media, sending it to the
   Recording Server.  An Recording Client is a logical function.  Its
   capabilities may be implemented across one or more physical devices.
   In practice, an Recording Client could be a personal device (such as
   a SIP phone), a SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border Controller
   (SBC) or an Application Server.  The Recording Client is also the
   source of the recorded session metadata

   Communication Session:  A SIP session created between two or more
   UA's for the purpose of communication which may be recorded (I.e.
   Not the Recording Session).

   Recording Session:  The session created between an Recording Client
   and Recording Server for the purpose of recording a Communication
   Session.

   Recording aware UA:  A SIP User Agent that can at a minimum
   understand notifications indicating that a Communication Session in
   which it is involved is being recorded.  It may also be able to
   express preferences relating to whether a Communication session can
   or should be recorded.

   Media Recording Metadata:  The metadata describing the communication
   session that is required by the Recording Server.  This will include
   for example the identity of users that participate in the
   Communication Session and dialog state.  Typically this metadata is
   archived with the replicated media at the recording server.  The
   media recording metadata is delivered in real-time to the Recording
   Server.

Internet-Draft      Architecture for Media Recording       February 2010


   Replicated Media:  A copy of the media associated with the
   Communication Session created by the Recording Client and sent to the
   Recording Server.  It may contain all the media associated with the
   communication session (E.g.  Audio and Video) or just a subset (E.g.
   Audio).


3.  Introduction

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document describes architectures for
   deploying session recording solutions in an environment which is
   based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) the requirements for
   which are described in [I-D.rehor-dispatch-session-recording-req].
   This is an initial draft which explores possible architectural
   solutions and has many open issues.

   This document focuses on how sessions are established between a
   Recording Client (RC) and the Recording Server for the purpose of
   conveying the Replicated Media and Media Recording Metadata (e.g.
   Identity of parties involves) relating to the Communication Session.

   Once the Replicated Media and Media Recording Metadata have been
   received by the Recording Server they will typically be archived for
   retrieval at a later time.  The procedures relating to the archiving
   and retrieval of this information in outside the scope of this
   document.

   This document only considers active recording, where the Recording
   Client purposefully streams media to a Recording Server.  Passive
   recording, where a recording device detects media directly from the
   network (E.g. using port mirroring techniques), is outside the scope
   of this document.  In addition, lawful intercept are outside the
   scope of this document which takes account of the IETF policy on
   wiretapping [RFC2804].

   The Recording Session that is established between the Recording
   Client and the Recording Server uses the normal procedures for
   establishing INVITE initiated dialogs as specified in [RFC3261] and
   uses SDP for describing the media to be used during the session as
   specified in [RFC4566].  However it is intended that some extensions
   to SIP (E.g.  Headers, Option Tags, Etc.) will be defined to support
   the requirements for media recording.  The Replicated Media is
   required to be sent in real-time to the Recording Server and is not



Hutton, et al.           Expires August 30, 2010                [Page 5]

   buffered by the Recording Client to allow for real-time analysis of
   the media by the Recording Server.

   This is an initial draft which explores some possible architectural
   solutions for media recording using SIP and it is intended as a basis
   for discussion.  A future version of this document will focus on a
   specific architectural solution and protocol extensions.


4.  Session Recording Architectures

4.1.  Location of the Recording Client

   This section contains some example session recording architectures
   showing how the Recording Client is a logical function that can be
   located in or split between various physical components.

4.1.1.  B2BUA acts as a Recording Client

   A SIP B2BUA which has access to the media that is to be recorded may
   act as a Recording Client.  The B2BUA may already be aware that a
   session needs to be recorded before the initial establishment of the
   communication session or the decision to record the session may occur
   after the session has been established.

   If the B2BUA/RC makes the decision to initiate the Recording Session
   then it will initiate the establishment of a SIP Session by sending
   an INVITE to the Recording Server.

   If the Recording Server makes the decision to initiate the recording
   session then it will initiate the establishment of a SIP Session by
   sending an INVITE to the B2BUA/Recording Client.

   OPEN ISSUE:  What would the Recording Server use as the Request-URI
   and how does it indicate that it wishes to record the session (i.e.
   recvonly the media).  The Recording server will probably need to use
   an offerless INVITE to allow the RC to provide the offer.  We also
   want to make sure the Recording Session actually terminates at a
   Recording Server and is not accidently retargeted so probably need to
   include a require header indicating that recording is required.

   The B2BUA/RC is responsible for notifying the UA's involved in the
   communication session that the session is being recorded.

   The B2BUA/RC is responsible for honouring any indication from
   recording aware UA's that the communication session must not be
   recorded.

   The Recording Server if it requires Media Recording Metadata relating
   to the communications session will request this information from the
   Recording Client.

   OPEN ISSUE:  Does the Recording Server have to request metadata from
   the Recording Client our does the Recording Client provide it anyway?

4.1.2.  Endpoint acts as Recording Client

   A SIP Endpoint / User Agent may act as a Recording Client in which
   case the endpoint sends the Replicated Media to the Recording Server

   If the endpoint makes the decision to initiate the Recording Session
   then it will initiate the establishment of a SIP Session by sending
   an INVITE to the Recording Server.

   If the Recording Server makes the decision to initiate the Recording
   Session then it will initiate the establishment of a SIP Session by

4.2.  Establishing the Recording Session

   The Recording Client or the Recording Server may initiate the
   Recording Session.

   It should be noted that the Recording Session is a completely
   independent from the Communication Session that is being recorded at
   both the SIP dialog level and at the session level.  For example if
   media encryption is used for the Communication Session the Recording
   Client must decrypt any media received on the Communication Session
   and, if required, re-encrypt the media using a separate SRTP key for
   the Recording Session before sending the media to the Recording
   Server.

4.2.1.  Recording Client Initiated Recording

   When the Recording Client initiates the Recording Session for the
   purpose of conveying media to the Recording Server it performs the
   following actions.

   o  Initiates the dialog by sending an INVITE request to the Recording
      Server.  The dialog is established according to the normal
      procedures for establishing an INVITE initiated dialog as
      specified in [RFC3261].

   o  Include in the INVITE an indication that the session is
      established for the purpose of recording the associated media.
      Possible mechanisms for this include using the Require header
      and/or a new media feature tag similar to the use of "isfocus" as
      defined in [RFC3840]

   o  Indicate support for the recording metadata event package.  Still
      to be decided what this is

   o  If the Replicated Media is to be started immediately then the
      Recording Client will include an SDP attribute of "a=sendonly" for
      each media line or "a=inactive" if it is not ready to transmit the
      media.

   o  The Recording Session may replicate all media associated with the
      Communication Session or only a subset.

   o  Replicate the media streams that are to be recorded and transmit
      the media to the Recording Server.

4.2.2.  Recording Server Initiated Recording

   When the Recording Server initiates the media recording session with
   the Recording Client it performs the following actions.

   o  Send an INVITE request to the Recording Client

   o  Include in the INVITE an indication that the session is
      established for the purpose of recording the associated media.
      Possible mechanisms for this include using the Require header or a
      media feature tag similar to the use of "isfocus" as defined in
      [RFC3840]

   o  Identify the session that is to be recorded - Possibly using the
      Join header [RFC3911]

Internet-Draft      Architecture for Media Recording       February 2010


   o  If the Recording Session is to be started immediately then the
      Recording Client will include an SDP attribute of "a=recvonly" for
      each media line or "a=inactive" if it is not ready to receive the
      media

   OPEN ISSUE:  How does the Recording Server discover what media
   streams are available to be recorded does it use an offerless INVITE
   and leave this decision to the Recording Client.

   OPEN ISSUE:  If the Recording Server wants to invoke persistent
   recording (I.e. all calls) and establish the recording session before
   the recorded session is established what are the procedures for this
   ?

4.2.3.  Pause/Resume Recording Session

   The Recording Server or the Recording Client may pause the recording
   by changing the SDP direction attribute to "inactive" and resume the
   recording by changing the direction back to "sendonly" or "recvonly"

4.2.4.  Media Stream Mixing

   In a basic session involving only audio there are typically two
   audio/RTP streams between the two UA's involved transporting media in
   each direction.  When recording this media the two streams may be
   mixed at the Recording Client before being transmitted to the
   Recording Server or it may be a requirement of the recoding server
   that the media streams are not mixed and are sent to the Recording
   Server as two separate streams.  The case when media is mixed at the
   Recording Client is simple as only a single media stream is required
   to be sent to the Recording Server.  However in the case when the
   media streams are not mixed then the SDP offer sent to the Recording
   Server must describe two separate media streams.  OPEN ISSUE:  HOW TO
   DO THIS COULD BE TWO SEPERATE INVITE DIALOGS OR SOME SDP ENHANCEMENTS
   ?

4.3.  Media Recording Metadata

4.3.1.  Contents of recording metadata

   The content of the recording metadata will be defined in a separate
   specification and therefore the following list is just a guide to the
   type of information that may be conveyed by the Recording Client to
   the Recording Server in the recording metadata.  OPEN ISSUE:  Need
   some discussion on this.

   o  Dialog identifiers for the Communication Session

   o  Identities of users taking part in the Communication Session

   o  Dialog state of the Communication Session

   o  Session state relating to the Communication Session(i.e. sendonly,
      inactive, sendrecv).

   o  Etc.

4.3.2.  Mechanisms for delivery of metadata to Recording Server

   OPEN ISSUE:  How should the metadata be transported possible
   mechanisms include an INFO package [I-D.ietf-sipcore-info-events]or
   an event package (possibly the dialog event package).

4.4.  Notifications to the Recorded User Agents

   Typically a user that is involved in a session that is to be recorded
   is notified by an announcement at the beginning of the session or may
   receive some warning tones within the media.  However the
   standardization of media recording protocols when using SIP enable an
   indication that the call is being recorded to be included in the
   signaling associated with that communication session

   It is the Recording Client that must provide a notification to all
   users for which it is replicated received media for the purpose of
   recording including the local user if the Recording Client is a SIP
   endpoint.

   If the Recording Client is aware that the remote UA is a recording
   aware UA then it MUST notify the UA using a SIP based mechanism.
   OPEN ISSUE:  TO BE DEFINED.  If the Recording Client is not aware
   that the peer UA is a recording aware UA then it MUST use an in-band
   tone or announcement to notify the remote UA.

4.5.  Preventing the recording of a SIP session

   A Recording Aware UA may include one of the following indications in
   an INVITE request.

   o  No Recording Allowed

   o  Recording Required

   OPEN ISSUES:  How are these conveyed one possibility is to use the
   require header so that if they are not understood the dialog will be

   terminated.


5.  IANA considerations

   None.


6.  Security considerations

   The Recording Session is fundamentally a standard SIP dialog and
   media session and therefore make use of existing SIP security
   mechanisms for securing the Recording Session and Media Recording
   Metadata.  SRTP is used for securing the Replicated Media.

   The intended use of this architecture is only for the case where the
   users are aware of that they are being recorded and the architecture
   provides the means for the Recording Client to notify users that they
   are being recorded.

   This architectural solution is not intended to support lawful
   intercept which in contrast requires that users are not informed.

   The Recording Client act that the Recording Client decrypts and re-
   encrypts media, means the Recording Client must take precautions to
   prevent disclosure of media in the clear.  Also the Recording Client
   has to be trusted not to manipulate or suppress media.

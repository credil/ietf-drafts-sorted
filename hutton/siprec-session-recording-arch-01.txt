    An Architecture for Media Recording using the Session Initiation
                                Protocol
             draft-hutton-siprec-session-recording-arch-01

Abstract

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document describes architectures for
   deploying session recording solutions in an environment which is
   based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant mechanisms.


2.  Definitions

   Session Recording Server (SRS):  A Session Recording Server (SRS) is
   a SIP User Agent (UA) that acts as the sink of the recorded media.
   An SRS is a logical function that typically archives media for
   extended durations of time and provides interfaces for search and
   retrieval of the archived media.  An SRS is typically implemented as
   a multi-port device that is capable of receiving media from several
   sources simultaneously.  An SRS is typically also the sink of the
   recorded session metadata.  Note that the term "Server" does not
   imply the SRS is the server side of a signaling protocol - the SRS
   may be the initiator of recording requests, for example.

   Session Recording Client (SRC):  A Session Recording Client (SRC) is
   a SIP User Agent (UA) that acts as the source of the recorded media,
   sending it to the Session Recording Server.  A Session Recording
   Client is a logical function.  Its capabilities may be implemented
   across one or more physical devices.  In practice, a Session
   Recording Client could be a personal device (such as a SIP phone), a
   SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border Controller (SBC), Media
   Server, or an Application Server.  The Session Recording Client is
   also the source of the recorded session metadata.

   Communication Session (CS):  A SIP session created between two or
   more UA's for the purpose of communication which may be recorded.

   Recording Session (RS):  The session created between an Session
   Recording Client and Session Recording Server for the purpose of
   recording a Communication Session.

   Recording aware UA:  A SIP User Agent that can at a minimum
   understand notifications indicating that a Communication Session in
   which it is involved is being recorded.  It may also be able to
   express preferences relating to whether a Communication session can
   or should be recorded.

   Media Recording Metadata (MRM):  The metadata describing the
   communication session that is required by the Session Recording
   Server.  This will include for example the identity of users that
   participate in the Communication Session and dialog state.  Typically

   this metadata is archived with the replicated media at the Session
   Recording Server.  The media recording metadata is delivered in real-
   time to the Session Recording Server.

   Replicated Media:  A copy of the media associated with the
   Communication Session created by the Session Recording Client and
   sent to the Session Recording Server.  It may contain all the media
   associated with the communication session (E.g.  Audio and Video) or
   just a subset (E.g.  Audio).


3.  Introduction

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document describes architectures for
   deploying session recording solutions in an environment which is
   based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) the requirements for
   which are described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-req].

   This document focuses on how sessions are established between a
   Session Recording Client (SRC) and the Session Recording Server (SRS)
   for the purpose of conveying the Replicated Media and Media Recording
   Metadata (e.g.  Identity of parties involved) relating to the
   Communication Session.

   Once the Replicated Media and Media Recording Metadata have been
   received by the Session Recording Server they will typically be
   archived for retrieval at a later time.  The procedures relating to
   the archiving and retrieval of this information in outside the scope
   of this document.

   This document only considers active recording, where the Session
   Recording Client purposefully streams media to a Session Recording
   Server.  Passive recording, where a recording device detects media
   directly from the network (E.g. using port mirroring techniques), is
   outside the scope of this document.  In addition, lawful intercept is
   outside the scope of this document which takes account of the IETF
   policy on wiretapping [RFC2804].

   The Recording Session that is established between the Session
   Recording Client and the Session Recording Server uses the normal
   procedures for establishing INVITE initiated dialogs as specified in
   [RFC3261] and uses SDP for describing the media to be used during the
   session as specified in [RFC4566].  However it is intended that some

   extensions to SIP (E.g.  Headers, Option Tags, Etc.) will be defined
   to support the requirements for media recording.  The Replicated
   Media is required to be sent in real-time to the Session Recording
   Server and is not buffered by the Session Recording Client to allow
   for real-time analysis of the media by the Session Recording Server.


4.  Session Recording Architecture

4.1.  Location of the Session Recording Client

   This section contains some example session recording architectures
   showing how the Session Recording Client is a logical function that
   can be located in or split between various physical components.

4.1.1.  B2BUA acts as a Session Recording Client

   A SIP B2BUA which has access to the media that is to be recorded may
   act as a Session Recording Client.  The B2BUA may already be aware
   that a session needs to be recorded before the initial establishment
   of the communication session or the decision to record the session
   may occur after the session has been established.

   If the B2BUA/SRC makes the decision to initiate the Recording Session
   (RS) then it will initiate the establishment of a SIP Session by
   sending an INVITE to the Session Recording Server.

   If the Session Recording Server makes the decision to initiate the
   recording session then it will initiate the establishment of a SIP
   Session by sending an INVITE to the B2BUA/Session Recording Client.

   The RS INVITE will need to contain information which identifies the
   session as being established for the purposes of recording and
   prevents the session from being accidently rerouted to a UA which is
   not a SRS.

   The B2BUA/SRC is responsible for notifying the UA's involved in the
   communication session that the session is being recorded.

   The B2BUA/SRC is responsible for honoring any indication from
   recording aware UA's or through some configured policies that the
   communication session must not be recorded.

   The Session Recording Server if it requires Media Recording Metadata
   relating to the communications session will request this information
   from the Session Recording Client.

   OPEN ISSUE:  Does the Session Recording Server have to request

   metadata from the SRC or does the SRC provide it anyway?

          Figure 1: B2BUA Acts as the Session Recording Client.


4.1.2.  Endpoint acts as Session Recording Client

   A SIP Endpoint / User Agent may act as a Session Recording Client in
   which case the endpoint sends the Replicated Media to the Session
   Recording Server

   If the endpoint makes the decision to initiate the Recording Session
   then it will initiate the establishment of a SIP Session by sending
   an INVITE to the Session Recording Server.

   If the Session Recording Server makes the decision to initiate the
   Recording Session then it will initiate the establishment of a SIP
   Session by sending an INVITE to the endpoint.

   OPEN ISSUE - Need to state how the SRC and SRS address each other -
   Use of GRUU etc.

4.1.3.  Interaction with MEDIACTRL

   The mediactrl architecture [RFC5567] describes an architecure in
   which an application server (AS) controls a Media Server (MS) which
   may be used for purposes such as conferencing and recording media
   streams.  In this architecure the AS typically uses SIP Third Party
   Call Control (3PCC) to instruct the SIP UA's to direct the media to
   the Media Server.

   The Session Recording Client and Session Recording Server described
   in this document may act as an application server as described in
   [RFC5567] and therefore may when further decomposed be made up of an
   application server which uses a mediactrl interface to control a
   media server for the purpose of recording the media streams however
   this interface is considered outside the scope of this document.

4.1.4.  Interaction with Conference Focus

   In the case of a centralised conference the conference focus
   [RFC4353] may also act as a SRC and therefore provide the SRS with a
   copy of the conferenced media or as a Recording Aware Client in the
   case when recording is initiated by one of the conference
   participants.

   The SRC when co-located with a conference focus may provide the SRS
   with information of all the conference participants within the
   recording metadata and be able to correlate the media streams, in the
   case of providing the SRS with separate streams for each participant,
   by providing information in the metadata which identifies the media
   stream for a given participant (E.g.  SSRC).

4.2.  Establishing the Recording Session

   The Session Recording Client or the Session Recording Server may
   initiate the Recording Session.

   It should be noted that the Recording Session is a completely
   independent from the Communication Session that is being recorded at

Internet-Draft      Architecture for Media Recording           June 2010


   both the SIP dialog level and at the session level.  For example if
   media encryption is used for the Communication Session the Session
   Recording Client must decrypt any media received on the Communication
   Session and, if required, re-encrypt the media using a separate SRTP
   key for the Recording Session before sending the media to the Session
   Recording Server.

4.2.1.  Session Recording Client Initiated Recording

   When the Session Recording Client initiates the Recording Session for
   the purpose of conveying media to the Session Recording Server it
   performs the following actions.

   o  Initiates the dialog by sending an INVITE request to the Session
      Recording Server.  The dialog is established according to the
      normal procedures for establishing an INVITE initiated dialog as
      specified in [RFC3261].

   o  Include in the INVITE an indication that the session is
      established for the purpose of recording the associated media.
      Possible mechanisms for this include using the Require header
      and/or a new media feature tag similar to the use of "isfocus" as
      defined in [RFC3840]

   o  Indicate support for the recording metadata event package.

   o  If the Replicated Media is to be started immediately then the
      Session Recording Client will include an SDP attribute of
      "a=sendonly" for each media line or "a=inactive" if it is not
      ready to transmit the media.

   o  The Recording Session may replicate all media associated with the
      Communication Session or only a subset.

   o  Replicate the media streams that are to be recorded and transmit
      the media to the Session Recording Server.

4.2.2.  Session Recording Server Initiated Recording

   When the Session Recording Server initiates the media recording
   session with the Session Recording Client it performs the following
   actions.

   o  Send an INVITE request to the Session Recording Client

   o  Include in the INVITE an indication that the session is
      established for the purpose of recording the associated media.
      Possible mechanisms for this include using the Require header or a

      media feature tag similar to the use of "isfocus" as defined in
      [RFC3840]

   o  Identify the session that is to be recorded - Possibly using the
      Join header [RFC3911]

   o  If the Recording Session is to be started immediately then the
      Session Recording Client will include an SDP attribute of
      "a=recvonly" for each media line or "a=inactive" if it is not
      ready to receive the media

   If the Session Recording Server does not have prior knowledge of what
   media streams are available to be recorded it can make use of an
   offerless INVITE which allows the Session Recording Client to make
   the initial SDP offer.

   OPEN ISSUE:  If the Session Recording Server wants to invoke
   persistent recording (I.e. all calls) and establish the recording
   session before the recorded session is established what are the
   procedures for this ?

4.2.3.  Pause/Resume Recording Session

   The Session Recording Server or the Session Recording Client may
   pause the recording by changing the SDP direction attribute to
   "inactive" and resume the recording by changing the direction back to
   "sendonly" or "recvonly"

4.2.4.  Media Stream Mixing

   In a basic session involving only audio there are typically two
   audio/RTP streams between the two UA's involved transporting media in
   each direction.  When recording this media the two streams may be
   mixed at the Session Recording Client before being transmitted to the
   Session Recording Server or it may be a requirement of the recoding
   server that the media streams are not mixed and are sent to the
   Session Recording Server as two separate streams.  The case when
   media is mixed at the Session Recording Client is simple as only a
   single media stream is required to be sent to the Session Recording
   Server.  However in the case when the media streams are not mixed
   then the SDP offer sent to the Session Recording Server must describe
   two separate media streams.

4.2.5.  Media Transcoding

   The communication session (CS) and the recording session (RS) are
   negotiated separately using a standard SDP offer/answer exchange
   which may result in the SRC having to perform media transcoding

   between the two sessions.  If the SRC is not capable of performing
   media transcoding it may be limit the media formats in the offer to
   the SRS depending on what media is negotiated on the CS or may limit
   what it includes in the offer on the CS if it has prior knowledge of
   the media formats supported by the SRS.  However typically the SRS
   will be the more capable device which can provide a wide range of
   media format options to the SRC and may also be able to make use of a
   media transcoder as detailed in [RFC5369].

4.3.  Media Recording Metadata

4.3.1.  Contents of recording metadata

   The content of the recording metadata will be defined in a separate
   specification and therefore the following list is just a guide to the
   type of information that may be conveyed by the Session Recording
   Client to the Session Recording Server in the recording metadata.

   o  Dialog identifiers for the Communication Session

   o  Identities of SIP UA's taking part in the Communication Session

   o  Dialog state of the Communication Session

   o  Session state relating to the Communication Session(i.e. sendonly,
      inactive, sendrecv).

   o  Etc.

4.3.2.  Mechanisms for delivery of metadata to Session Recording Server

   The recording metadata definition will be described through an XML
   schema.  There are several potential mechanisms for transporting
   metadata from SRC to SRS.  They have their pros and cons.  These
   mechanisms include the following:

   o  Event Package:  The metadata event XML documents may be conveyed
      from SRC to SRS by defining an event-package and using it with the
      SIP events notification mechanism [RFC3265].  This allows the
      metadata to be communicated within its own SUBSCRIBE initiated
      dialog as opposed to be in-band to the SIP INVITE RS dialog.  This
      allows for sending metadata where the CS and RS lifecycles are
      different.

   o  INFO Package:  The metadata event XML documents may be conveyed
      from SRC to SRS by defining an INFO package
      [draft-ietf-sipcore-info-events] and using it inside the SIP
      method [RFC 2976].  Since INFO is a mid-dialog request, this

      mechanism requires the metadata to be communicated within the SIP
      INVITE RS dialog.

   o  Using Non-SIP Mechanism:  The recording metadata may be conveyed
      using some other non-SIP means (e.g.  HTTP, WS-*), while still
      adhering to the recording metadata XML.

4.4.  Notifications to the Recorded User Agents

   Typically a user that is involved in a session that is to be recorded
   is notified by an announcement at the beginning of the session or may
   receive some warning tones within the media.  However the
   standardization of media recording protocols when using SIP enable an
   indication that the call is being recorded to be included in the
   signaling associated with that communication session

   It is the Session Recording Client that must provide a notification
   to all users for which it is replicated received media for the
   purpose of recording including the local user if the Session
   Recording Client is a SIP endpoint.

   If the Session Recording Client is aware that the remote UA is a
   recording aware UA then it MUST notify the UA using a SIP based
   mechanism.  If the Session Recording Client is not aware that the
   peer UA is a recording aware UA then it MUST use an in-band tone or
   announcement to notify the remote UA.

4.5.  Preventing the recording of a SIP session

   A Recording Aware UA may include one of the following indications in
   an INVITE request.

   o  No Recording Allowed

   o  Recording Required

   OPEN ISSUES:  How are these conveyed one possibility is to use the
   require header so that if they are not understood the dialog will be
   terminated.


5.  IANA considerations

   None.

6.  Security considerations

   The Recording Session is fundamentally a standard SIP dialog and
   media session and therefore make use of existing SIP security
   mechanisms for securing the Recording Session and Media Recording
   Metadata.  SRTP is used for securing the Replicated Media.

   The intended use of this architecture is only for the case where the
   users are aware of that they are being recorded and the architecture
   provides the means for the Session Recording Client to notify users
   that they are being recorded.

   This architectural solution is not intended to support lawful
   intercept which in contrast requires that users are not informed.

   The Session Recording Client fact that the Recording Client decrypts
   and re-encrypts media, means the Session Recording Client must take
   precautions to prevent disclosure of media in the clear.  Also the
   Session Recording Client has to be trusted not to manipulate or
   suppress media.

   It is the responsibility of the Session Recording Server to protect
   the Replicated Media and Media Recording Metadata once it has been
   received and archived.

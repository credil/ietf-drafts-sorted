     A mechanism for conveying alternate addresses using ICE syntax
                  draft-hutton-mmusic-icemicrolite-01

Abstract

   This document proposes a mechanism for conveying multiple IP
   addresses, of different address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) for a
   given medium, in the same Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer.
   This proposed mechanism solves the backward compatibility which
   exists with ANAT, due to its syntax, and provides a migration path
   towards support for ICE.  The proposed mechanism is significantly
   less complex then ICE or ICE-Lite but uses ICE syntax.  The mechanism
   described in this document has been named ICE-microLite.

Internet-Draft                ICE-microLite                   March 2010


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant mechanisms.


2.  Introduction

   This document proposes a mechanism which allows the carriage of
   multiple IP addresses, of different address families (e.g., IPv4,
   IPv6) for a given medium, in the same Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [RFC4566] offer [RFC3264].  The proposed attribute solves the
   backward compatibility problem which exists with the earlier ANAT
   [RFC4091] mechanism, due to its syntax, and provides a migration path
   towards support for ICE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice].  The proposed
   mechanism is significantly less complex then ICE or ICE-Lite but uses
   ICE syntax.  The mechanism described in this document has been named
   ICE-microLite.  This mechanism should be considered as an alternative
   mechanism to that described in [I-D.boucadair-mmusic-altc].

2.1.  Purpose

   The purpose of this proposal is to provide a mechanism for conveying
   multiple media connection addresses for a given medium in an SDP
   offer in a way that is backwards compatible with existing SDP
   implementations.  The proposed mechanism allows the receiver of the
   offer, if it understands the syntax, to select the media connection
   address which it prefers.  If the receiver of the offer does not
   understand the proposed mechanism then it will use the SDP connection
   data ("c=") and therefore fall back to the default address family as
   preferred by the offerer, which for reasons of backwards
   compatibility will normally be an IPv4 address.

   Currently the IETF intended mechanism for providing an IPv4 to IPv6
   transition mechanism for conveying multiple media addresses in SDP is
   ICE acting as replacemant for ANAT.  However support for ICE or ICE-
   Lite, which is a subset of ICE, is over complex for scenarios in
   which a transition mechanism is needed without the need to use ICE
   for NAT traversal and connectivity checking.

   The mechanism proposed in this document does however make use of ICE
   syntax, so providing the possibility for an implementation to be
   enhanced to support ICE or ICE-Lite without having to use a
   completely different syntax.

   The proposed solution provides the following benefits:

Internet-Draft                ICE-microLite                   March 2010


   o  allows a UA to signal more than one IP address (type) for the same
      medium in an SDP offer/answer;

   o  is backwards compatible with non-ICE implementations because it
      uses the same backwards compatibility mechanism as ICE;

   o  it is a lightweight mechanism that uses ICE syntax but does not
      require any of the complexities of ICE (E.g.  Connectivity
      checking etc.);

   o  by using ICE Syntax it provides a migration path towards support
      for ICE-Lite or full ICE.

2.2.  Scope

   This document proposes a simplified ICE-like syntax to carry several
   IP address types for the same medium in an SDP offer/answer while
   preserving backward compatibility.

   The scope of this proposal is the same as [I-D.boucadair-mmusic-altc]
   and likewise does not include addressing at the SIP layer.

2.3.  Use Cases

   The use cases for this proposal are the same as the use cases
   detailed in [I-D.boucadair-mmusic-altc].


3.  Overview of ICE-microLite

   ICE-microLite is a migration step towards introduction of ICE-Lite.
   Compared to ICE-Lite, the functionality of an ICE-microLite
   implementation is further reduced such that:

   o  an ICE-microLite implementation does not require a STUN server as
      no connectivity checking is performed.

   o  an an ICE-microLite implementation only provides candidates for a
      single foundation (I.e.  RTP Component and RTCP Component) in an
      SDP answer.

   o  it is a lightweight mechanism which uses ICE syntax but does not
      require any of the complexities of ICE (E.g.  Connectivity
      checking etc.)

   o  an ICE-microLite implementation uses dummy values for the STUN-
      related ICE attributes since STUN is not used.  The attributes are
      still included to maintain compatibility with ICE.

Internet-Draft                ICE-microLite                   March 2010


   o  an ICE-microLite implementation sets the ice-options attribute to
      "a=ice-options microlite".

   An extension to the ICE a=candidate attribute provides the required
   functionality.  For example:

  a=candidate:1 1 UDP 2130706431 192.0.2.1 0 typ host microliteport 3478

   This extension does not use the port field of the regular a=candidate
   attribute, but rather provides the port in an extension called
   microliteport.  An ICE-microLite implementation will set the value of
   the regular port field to "0".  Consequently, implementations which
   support ICE according to [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice], but are not ICE-
   microLite aware will not find a default candidate matching port and
   IP address in the SDP's m/c-line, will detect an ICE mismatch and
   will fall-back to default SDP processing.

   An example of an SDP offer using this mechanism is as follows when
   IPv6 is preferred but IPv4 is the fall back option.


  v=0
  o=test 2890844342 2890842164 IN IP4 192.0.2.2
  c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
  t=0 0
  a=ice-lite
  a=ice-options microlite
  a=ice-pwd:microlitemicrolitemicrolite
  a=ice-ufrag:microlite
  m=audio 3480 RTP/AVP 0
  b=RS:0
  b=RR:0
  a=candidate:1 1 UDP 2130706431 2001:::1 0 typ host microliteport 3478
  a=candidate:2 1 UDP 2130706430 192.0.2.2 0 typ host microliteport 3480



4.  Procedures

4.1.  Sending the initial Offer

   The procedures for sending the initial offer are the same as
   specified for a an ICE-lite implementation in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice]
   except for the following:

   o  An ICE-microLite implementation is not required to use random
      values for the a=ice-ufrag and the a=ice-pwd attributes.  An ICE-
      microLite implementation MUST use the following default values of

Internet-Draft                ICE-microLite                   March 2010


      "a=ice-pwd:microlitemicrolitemicrolite" and "a=ice-
      ufrag:microlite".  These attributes are not actually required by
      ICE-microLite but are maintained for compatability with ICE
      implementations.

   o  An ICE-microLite implementation MUST set the port field in ICE
      a=candidate attribute to "0" and MUST include the local port of
      the candidate in the microliteport field of the candidate.

4.2.  Receiving an SDP Offer

   An ICE-microLite SIP UA MUST ignore any candidate-types that are not
   of type host.

   If the a=candidate attributes for the host candidates in the received
   SDP offer do not contain the microliteport field in the ICE
   a=candidate attribute, the ICE-microLite SIP UA MUST ignore all other
   ICE attributes and process the SDP based on normal [RFC3264]
   procedures.  Consequently, the SDP answer of the ICE-microLite SIP UA
   MUST NOT contain any ICE attribute in this case.  This means that
   when the offer was generated by a UA which is not ICE-microLite aware
   the result will be a fall-back to the default candidates and normal
   SDP procedures.

   If the a=candidate attributes for the host candidates in the received
   SDP offer contains the microliteport field, the ICE-microLite SIP UA
   MUST use that value as port number instead of using the value in the
   port field..  An ICE-microLite SIP UA MUST ignore any port value
   received in the regular port field of the a=candidate attribute.

4.3.  Sending an SDP Answer

   An ICE-microLite implementation is not required to send the SDP
   answer in a 18x provisional response or send the response reliably as
   recommended by [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice].  This is because no
   connectivity checking takes place.

   An ICE-microLite implementation is not required to use random values
   for the a=ice-ufrag and the a=ice-pwd attributes as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice].  An ICE-microLite implementation MUST use the
   following default values of "a=ice-pwd:microlitemicrolitemicrolite"
   and "a=ice-ufrag:microlite".  These attributes are not actually
   required by ICE-microLite but are maintained for compatability with
   ICE implementations.

   An ICE-microLite SIP UA generating an SDP Answer MUST set the port
   field in the a=candidate attribute to "0" and MUST include the local
   port of the candidate in the microliteport field.

Internet-Draft                ICE-microLite                   March 2010


   An ICE-microLite SIP UA MUST select its preferred candidate (E.g.
   based on IP address family) by listing only the selected candidate
   foundation in its SDP answer.

4.4.  Receiving an SDP Answer

   An ICE-microLite SIP UA will receive an SDP answer with only a single
   candidate pair per component from an ICE-microLite aware SIP UA
   compliant to this specification.

   An SDP answer received from a SIP UA that is not ICE, ICE-lite or
   ICE-microLite will not contain ICE attributes other than
   "a=icemismatch".


5.  Compatibility with ICE and ICE-Lite

   An ICE or ICE-Lite implementation that is not ICE-microLite aware
   will detect an ice mismatch when receiving an ICE-microLite SDP offer
   and fallback to normal SDP processing.

   An ICE or ICE-Lite implementation that is ICE-microLite aware will be
   aware that a received SDP offer is a ICE-microLite offer and respond
   according to the procedures in this document.

   An ICE-microLite implementation that receives an SDP offer from a
   full ICE implementation will fallback to normal SDP processing.

   An ICE-microLite implementatin that receives an SDP offer from an
   ICE-Lite implementation may respond with an ICE-Lite compatible
   answer.  This is safe because the ICE-lite client will never initiate
   conectivity checking.

   An ICE or ICE-Lite implementation that also supports ICE-microLite
   can include in the offer the microliteport extension which would
   allow an ICE-microLite implementation receiving the offer to generate
   an SDP answer also containing the microliteport extension.

6.  Extension to ICE candidate attribute

   The ICE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] a=candidate attribute is extended as
   follows:


    candidate-attribute = "candidate" ":" foundation SP component-id SP
    transport SP
    priority SP
    connection-address SP     ;from RFC 4566
    port                      ;port from RFC 4566
    SP cand-type
    [SP rel-addr]
    [SP rel-port]
    [SP microliteport]
    *(SP extension-att-name SP
    extension-att-value)

    microliteport = "microliteport" SP port



7.  IANA considerations

   If this document moves forward, it requests a new extension attribute
   "microliteport", to be defined for the ICE candidate-attribute and a
   new ice-options attribute "microlite" to be reserved.


8.  Security considerations

   As with any SDP offer or answer, an attacker modifying the SDP can
   mount a variety of attacks.  To counter this, SDP should be integrity
   protected by some means.  Also an attacker eavesdropping on the SDP
   can discover addresses and ports on which to mount attacks (e.g.,
   denial of service).  To counter this, SDP should be confidentiality
   protected by some means.  Such means will depend on the protocol used
   to convey SDP.  For example, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [RFC3261] can be transported over TLS or can protect SDP bodies using
   S/MIME.

			<t>This document describes a Web-service interface standard for an authentication-data validation service that supports risk-based, multi-factor authentication.This standard enables enterprises to
				deploy best-of-breed solutions combining components from different vendors into the
				same infrastructure. </t>
		</abstract>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>The Authentication-Data Validation Service Interface definition (VALID) describes a Web-service interface for a validation server.  The specification reuses data definitions from <xref target="SAML"/>, <xref target="WS-Security"/> and <xref target="WS-Trust"/> and operates over version 1.2 of <xref target="SOAP"/>.  Upon successful validation, the validation server returns a SAML assertion containing verified attributes of the authenticated end-user or a hardware or software device under the end-user's control.  Communications between the end-user and the application are not required to follow the Web-services programming model.</t>
				
				<section title="Key Words">
					<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
						NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
						described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
				</section>				
				
				<section title="Notation">
					<t>This specification uses the following syntax to define outlines for messages:</t>
					<t>
					<list style="hanging">
					<t>The syntax appears as an XML instance.</t>
					<t>Characters are appended to elements and attributes to indicate cardinality:</t>
					<t>"?" (0 or 1)</t>
					<t>"*" (0 or more)</t>
					<t>"+" (1 or more)</t>
					<t>The character "|" is used to indicate a choice between alternatives.</t>
					<t>The characters "(" and ")" are used to indicate that contained items are to be treated as a group with respect to cardinality or choice.</t>
					<t>The characters "[" and "]" are used to call out references and property names.</t>
					<t>Additional child elements and/or attributes MAY be added at the indicated extension points (see <xref target="Extensibility"/>) but MUST NOT contradict the semantics of the parent and/or owner, respectively. By default, if a receiver does not recognize an extension, the receiver SHOULD ignore the extension; exceptions to this processing rule, if any, are clearly indicated below.</t>
					<t>XML namespace prefixes (see Table 1) are used to indicate the namespace of the element being defined.</t>
					<t>Elements and Attributes defined by this specification are referred to in the text of this document using XPath 1.0 expressions. Extensibility points are referred to using an extended version of this syntax:</t>
					<t>
					<list style="hanging">
					<t>An element extensibility point is referred to using {any} in place of the element name. This indicates that any element name can be used, from any namespace other than the namespace of this specification.</t>
					<t>An attribute extensibility point is referred to using @{any} in place of the attribute name. This indicates that any attribute name can be used, from any namespace other than the namespace of this specification</t>
						</list>
						</t>
					</list>
					</t>
				</section>				
			
		<section title="Namespaces">
			<t>The following XML namespace prefixes are used in the specification.</t>

		<section title="Authentication-Data Validation Service Interface overview">
			<t>The Authentication-Data Validation Service Interface allows communication of the following data elements in several different communication patterns as described in <xref target="communicationPatterns"/>. The interface is based mainly on <xref target="WS-Trust"/>. The following sections apply terminologies and concepts defined in <xref target="WS-Trust"/>.</t>

		<section title="Authentication data communication">
			<t>The specific requirements for authentication data communication depend upon the specific authentication mechanism.</t>
			<t>In-band authentication data SHALL be passed in the body of &lt;wst:RequestSecurityToken&gt; and &lt;wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse&gt; elements.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Verified attributes">
		<t>Upon successful validation of the authentication data, the validation server SHALL issue a SAML assertion containing verified end-user or token attributes, depending if the server is validating user identities (user centric authentication) or device/token (pseudonomous - token centric authentication) . The client MAY provide a &lt;wsp:Policy&gt; element indicating which attributes it requires.  Required attributes SHALL be referenced using the &lt;saml:Attribute&gt; element, with the &lt;saml:AttributeValue&gt; child element omitted.
		</t>
		<t> The validation server MAY include the sub-set of the requested attributes whose verified values are known to it.  Otherwise, the validation server SHALL include all verified attributes whose values are known to it.  These attributes MUST be included in the SAML assertion.  They MUST also be included in a separate &lt;wst:Claims&gt; element.  In this way, the application may treat the assertion as opaque data, extracting any attributes it requires from the &lt;wst:Claims&gt; element.</t>
		<t>Attributes SHALL be expressed as &lt;saml:Attribute&gt; elements in accordance with the SAML V2.0 X.500/LDAP Attribute Profile.
		</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Challenge/response">
		<t>Multi-step authentication mechanisms are supported as shown here.</t>

			<t>The "In-band 2 way challenge/response" pattern is shown in <xref target="inband2wcr_figure"/>.  This pattern is based on the In-band Challenge/Response pattern but authenticates both the server and the client. The application receives an in-band client challenge (1). The application invokes the validation server (2).  The validation server returns the response to the client challenge and a server challenge (3).  The application passes the server response and server challenge to the end-user (4).  The end-user may or may not transform the server challenge and after verifying the server response sends the result to the validation server in-band (5).  The application supplies the authentication data to the validation server and receives an assertion in return (6).

	<section title="User centric and device centric (pseudonymous) authentication models">
	<t>There are two authentication models supported by this specification:</t>
	<section title="User Centric authentication model">
		<t>In this model the mapping between a specific user and the devices that belong to the specific user is known and managed by the validation server. This means that the authentication request will contain explicit user information in form of a UserId</t>
	</section>
	<section title="Device Centric authentication model">
		<t>In this model the validation server does not have any knowledge to whom a specific device belongs. The user-device mapping will be at the appllication or service provider. This means that the authentication request MUST NOT contain uer information and that it MUST contain information to uniquely identify the device by using the &lt;DeviceInfo&gt; element as defined in <xref target="PSKC"/>.
		</t>
	</section>	
	</section>

	<section title="Authentication moving factor resync">
	<t>Some authentication schemes gradually lose synchronization between client and server.  In order to compensate for this, the server must accept authentication data values within a range, or window of the moving factor (e.g. the event counter used in event based one time password algorithms, see <xref target="HOTP"/>).  When an authentication moving factor drifts to the edge of, or beyond, the server's window for a particular end-user, the server has to adjust its window.  This process is known as resyncing.
	</t>
	<t>Resyncing erodes assurance in the authentication event.  So, following a resync event, the validation server commonly requests a second authentication data value, which effectively restores the level of assurance provided by the authentication.
	</t>
	<t>The following two approaches to resyncing exist:</t>
	<section title="Automatic re-sync based on authentication data">
		<t>In this approach, the resynchronisation is based only on the authentication data. In this apporach the server searches through an extended window of the moving factor(s) to see if it can match the presented authentication data. In this apporach two OTPs MUST be transmitted so that the server MUST try to match the first OTP with the extended window and also MUST match the second OTP with a normal window.
		</t>
	</section>
	<section title="Manual re-sync based on presenting moving factor values">
		<t>In this approach to resynchronisation, the server is given the exact value of the moving factor (e.g. the event counter value in <xref target="HOTP"/>) together with the OTP. The server MUST only set the moving factor(s) to the received value if the OTP matches successfully (given the new moving factor values).
		</t>
	</section>	
	</section>

	<section title="Policy models">
		<t>Authentication policy defines the requirements for accessing a resource in terms of mechanisms and their strengths, expressible in disjunctive normal form (that is a disjunction ("OR") of conjunctions ("AND"s)).  This approach supports risk-based multi-factor authentication.</t>
		<t>Two policy models are supported.  In the first model (see figuer below), the application is responsible for invoking the right combination of validation servers in order to satisfy the authentication policy.

		<section title="Use Cases">

			<t>This section describes a comprehensive list of use cases that inspired the
				development of this specification. These requirements were used to derive the
				primary requirement that drove the design. These requirements are covered in the
				next section.</t>
			<t>These use cases also help in understanding the applicability of this specification to
				real world situations.</t>
			<section title="Validation">

				<section title="OTP Validation">
					<t>An application needs to validate an OTP obtained from an end-user, before providing the end-user with access to the requested resource(s).
The validation request may pass through several SOAP intermediaries. If this is the case, the application message needs to specify the ultimate validation server endpoint via SOAP addressing means, e.g., by using SOAP actors, to avoid the OTP being evaluated several times.
The response may include additional instructions to the token, for example that it needs to be resynchronized. This information must be defined inside a SOAP message.
</t>
<t>Valid credentials that can be passed in the valildation request:
<list style="symbols">
	<t>Username, PIN + OTP</t>
	<t>Username, OTP</t>
	<t>TokenId + OTP</t>
	<t>Array of TokenId + OTP</t>
</list>
</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Challenge/Response Validation – Server generated challenge">
					<t>An application needs to be able to use a token implementing the OCRA challenge/response algorithm for identifying the end user. 

The application requests from the validation server the challenge to be presented to the token (with the end-user keying the challenge into the token by means of a PINPad) or the challenge presented to the API of the connected token 

The application then uses the protocol to verify the response from the token
</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Challenge/Response Validation – User generated challenge">
					<t>An application needs to be able to use a token implementing the OCRA challenge/response algorithm for identifying the end user. 

The application generates the challenge to be presented to the token (with the end-user keying the challenge into the token by means of a PINPad) or the challenge presented to the API of the connected token 

The application then uses the protocol to verify the challenge and the response from the token.
</t>
				</section>

				<section title="2-way mutual Challenge/Response Validation">
					<t>An application needs to be able to use a token implementing the OCRA 2 way challenge/response algorithm for identifying the end user and the user will identify the validation server. 

A connected token generates a client challenge and trasnmits it to the appllication, the application will accept the challenge and send it to the validation server, which will then return a server-response to the client challenge and a server challenge. The connected token will verify the server response and after successfully validating the server response sends uses the server-challenge to generate a client-response which is sent to the appliaction. 

The application then uses the protocol to verify the the response from the connected client.
</t>
				</section>
				<section title="OTP Validation + Server managed PIN">
					<t>An application needs to be able to use a token implementing the TOTP algorithm as one factor and a server managed PIN as a second factor, for indetifying the end user.

The verification of both factors should occur within one message request/response pair of the protocol. 
 </t>

				</section>
				<section title="MatrixCardValidation – Server generated challenge">
					<t>An application needs to be able to use MatrixCard challenge/response algorithm for identifying the end user. 

The application will request from the validation server the challenge to be presented to the user via the user interface and the user response entered into a webform

The application will then use the protocol to verify the response from the token
</t>

				</section>				
			</section>

			<section title="Synchronisation Use Cases">
				<t>This section describes the use cases relating to synchronisation of the token and the server.</t>

				<section title="OTP Token Resync with the Next OTPs">
					<t>An application needs to validate an OTP but the OTP could not be validated because the OTP moving factor is out-of-sync between the token and the server. The validation server detects that the given OTP corresponds to a future moving factor that falls in an acceptable re-sync window. The application decides that a re-sync is necessary. It asks the next generated OTP from the token to re-sync the token. The validation server adjusts its record of the token's moving factor to the one that corresponds to the given OTP upon successful validation. Two consecutive OTPs could also be directly used for a validation server to re-sync a token, where the server tries to match the first OTP with an extended synchronization window and then match the second OTP with a normal authentication window.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="OTP Token Resync with Moving Factor">
				<t>An application needs to validate an OTP but the OTP could not be validated because the OTP moving factor is out-of-sync between the token and the server. The validation server detects that the given OTP corresponds to a future moving factor that falls in an acceptable re-sync window. The application decides that a re-sync is necessary. It uses values that can be read by the user of the token (e.g. event counter value, time interval counter value) to re-sync the token together with the next generated OTP of the token.</t>
				</section> 
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Requirements">
			<t>This section outlines the most relevant requirements that are the basis of this work.
				Several of the requirements were derived from use cases described above. <list
					style="format R%d:">
					<t>The protocol must support authentication of request originator.</t>
					<t>The protocol must support  management data flows (e.g., related to token synchronization)</t>
					<t>The protocol needs to support the following algorithms <list style="symbols">
							<t>HOTP</t>
							<t>OCRA</t>
							<t>TOTP</t>
							<t>Proprietary OTP</t>
							<t>Proprietary Challenge/Response</t>
							<t>Matrix cards</t>
							<t>SMS OTP</t>
							<t>PKI based challenge/response</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>The protocol must be XML/Web Services based.</t>
					<t>The protocol must support SOAP intermediaries.</t>

Abstract

   Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) become more and more widespread in
   modern desktop and laptop computers and provide secure storage and
   cryptographic functions.  As one nice feature of TPMs is that they
   can be identified uniquely, they provide a good base for device
   authentication in protocols like TLS.  This document specifies a TLS
   extension that allows to use TPM certified keys with TLS in order to
   allow for a secure and comfortable device authentication in TLS.

1.  Introduction

   This document aims at specifying a new TLS extension that allows to
   use TPM certified keys directly with TLS [RFC5246].  TPM is short for
   Trusted Platform Module and describes a trusted module that provides
   secure storage and some cryptographic function and has been specified
   in [TPMMainP1].  The TPM comes with the possibility to create so
   called Attestation Identity Keys (AIKs) that prove that a platform
   equipped with a TPM is a given platform.  Although those AIKs cannot
   be used in protocols like TLS without further changes to the
   protocol, [TPMMainP3] introduces so called certified keys.  Certified
   keys are RSA keys that are certified by other keys, for instance by
   an AIK.  Keys that are certified by an AIK are non migratable which
   means they remain in the same TPM forever.  In order to use those
   keys with TLS, one has to create a self-signed certificate including
   the SKAE extension [SKAE], which will be used during the TLS
   handshake.  In order to be able to verify that the key is stored
   inside a given TPM, the AIK will be send in the supplemental data
   handshake message.


2.  Terms and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Furthermore, the document uses the following terms and abbreviations:

   AIK - Attestation Identity Key

   CA - Certificate Authority

   Entity - One of the communication end points, be it either client or
   server.

   PCA - Privacy CA

   TLS - Transport Layer Security

   TPM - Trusted Platform Module


3.  Certification Process

   This section describes the process of creating and requesting all the
   certificates necessary to be used with the TLS TPM extension
   specified in the next sections.



Latze, et al.             Expires May 31, 2010                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                tls-tpm-extn                 November 2009


   First of all an TPM equipped entity has to request its AIK as
   specified in [TPMMainP1].  Afterwards, a new non-migratable key has
   to be created and certified using the AIK.  The details about the
   certification process can be found in [TPMMainP3].  Some details will
   be repeated here for convenience.

   The certificate is done using either TPM_CertifyKey or
   TPM_CertifyKey2 (for details about when to use which function, have a
   look at [TPMMainP3]).  Depending on the key properties, those
   functions result in either TCPA_CERTIFY_INFO or TCPA_CERTIFY_INFO2
   structure, whereas the first is compatible to the TPM 1.1 standard
   [TCGMainSpec].

   Now that the entity has an AIK and a certified key structure, a self-
   signed certificate around the certified key has to be created.  As
   the TCPA_CERTIFY_INFO (or TCPA_CERTIFY_INFO2) structure is needed to
   verify the binding between AIK and the certified key, that self-
   signed certificate has to include the Subject Key Attestation
   Evidence (SKAE) extension defined in [SKAE].  The SKAE extension is
   an X.509 extension that has been defined to carry the certify info
   structure returned by TPM_CertifyKey (or TPM_CertifyKey2).

   The self-signed certificate will be sent during the TLS handshake in
   the Certificate message whereas the AIK MUST be announced with the
   TLS TPM extension type and sent in the supplemental data handshake
   message.


4.  TLS TPM Extension Type

   The general TLS extension format has been defined in [RFC5246] and
   will be repeated here for convenience:
   struct {
       ExtensionType extension_type;
       opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
   }

   The new extension types for TPM enabled entities are called
   client_aik and server_aik:
   enum {
      client_aik(TBD), server_aik(TBD), (65535)
   } ExtensionType

   This extensions MAY be used in full handshakes as well as in session
   resumption handshakes.  Although the latter does not require a
   certificate exchange it might happen that the server refuses to
   accept a resumed session and runs a full handshake instead.  In order
   to be able to do that without interruption, the extensions SHOULD be

Internet-Draft                tls-tpm-extn                 November 2009


   included also in the session resumption handshake.

   The extension includes the certify info type the client is able to
   create and verify:
   enum {
      tpm_certify_info(0), tpm_certify_info2(1), (255)
   } CertifyInfoType

   The client includes client_aik in order to indicate that he wants to
   use a self-signed certified key during the handshake and send the AIK
   in the supplemental data handshake message.  If the server receives
   client_aik, he MUST respond with same client_aik - possibly removing
   unsupported certify info types or omit the extension in case it is
   not supported by the server.

   In case the client wants to authenticate the server also using TPM
   certified keys, he MUST include server_aik in its extended hello
   message.The server_aik contains all the certify info types the client
   is able to verify.  If the server receives server_aik and accepts it,
   he MUST respond with the same server_aik - possibly removing certify
   info types he cannot create.  Otherwise the server omits server_aik.


5.  TLS TPM Supplemental Data Handshake Message

   The TLS supplemental data handshake message as defined in [RFC4680]
   allows to send additional application data during the TLS handshake
   if it has been announced in a TLS extension.

   This document defines a new supplemental data type:
   enum {
      aik_data(TBD), (65535)
   }

   with
   struct {
       SupplementalDataType supplemental_data_type;
       select(SupplementalDataType) {
          case aik_data: AikData;
       }
   } SupplementalData

   and
   opaque ASN.1Cert<2^24-1>;

   struct {
      ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
   } AikData;

Internet-Draft                tls-tpm-extn                 November 2009


   AikData carries the entity's AIK chain.


6.  TLS Handshake Using The TPM Extensions

   Figure Figure 1 shows the full TLS handshake with a TPM equipped
   client:

   Finally, figure Figure 3 shows the TLS handshakes if both sides make
   use of certified keys:

   * indicates optional or situation dependant messages

     Figure 3: Full TLS Handshake With TPM Equipped Client and Server

   The authentication of either client or server is done by verifying
   the self-signed certificate as well as by verifying the binding

   between the AIK and the certified key in order to ensure that the key
   used is really protected by a given TPM.  In order to verify the
   binding, the SKAE extension of the self-signed certificate has to be
   evaluated using the AIK.

   There is no need for additional TLS alerts since all the existing
   certificate related alerts cover possible problems during the entity
   verification.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes the following IANA requests:

   1.  A new registry for certify info types needs to be maintained by
       IANA.  The first two types include tpm_certify_info(0) and
       tpm_certify_info2(1).  Certify info types with values in the
       inclusive range of 0 to 63 (decimal) are assigned using RFC 5226
       [RFC5226] Standards Action, whereas values from the inclusive
       range of 64 to 223 (decimal) are using RFC 2434 Specification
       Required.  Values in the inclusive range of 224 to 255 (decimal)
       are reserved for RFC 2434 Private Use.

   2.  The values client_aik(TBD) and server_aik(TBD) are assigned from
       TLS Extension Type Registry [RFC5246].

   3.  The value aik_data(TBD) is assigned from TLS Supplemental Data
       Type registry [RFC4680].


8.  Security Considerations

   If an entity certified several keys with the same AIK, somebody who
   has the AIK and all of the certified keys is able to track that
   identity.  Therefore, the AIK might be seen as sensitive information
   forcing an implementation to use the double handshake technique.  The
   first handshake requires one or both entities to accept the self-
   signed certificate since the binding can only be verified during the
   second protected handhake.


9.  Acknowledgements

   The basic idea to use the supplemental data handshake message to
   supply the AIK was supplied by Sam Hartmann.

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for context transfer between
   Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) in a large Proxy MIPv6 domain to
   provide the IP ongoing session continuity of mobile nodes. In order
   to enhance the performance of the LMA handover, a bi-directional
   tunnel between a previous LMA and a new target LMA is established.

Internet-Draft      LMA Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6     October 2009


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

 
2.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] domain refers to the network
   where the mobility management of a Mobile Node (MN) is handled using
   the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol. The Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain includes
   Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) and Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs).
   This document describes a mechanism to provide the ongoing session
   continuity to a MN during the handover from one LMA to another LMA
   in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

   This specification addresses the following problems: 

   o  Who and when to trigger the LMA handover.
   o  Who and how to select a new target LMA.
   o  How to transfer the context information between LMAs.
   o  Table updates of network entities.
   o  Other considerations.

   When a previous MAG and a new MAG share the same LMA, the previous
   MAG transfers the context information of a MN to the new MAG via the
   bi-directional tunnel between them by using a MAG handover mechanism,
   such as the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PFMIPv6) [PFMIPv6]
   protocol. This document provides a mechanism for transferring the
   context information of a MN from a Previous LMA (PLMA) to a new LMA
   (NLMA) by establishing a bi-directional tunnel.


3.  Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology from [RFC5213] and [RFC3775].
   The following terms and abbreviations are additionally used in this 
   document.
   
   Boundary Mobile Access Gateway (bMAG):
      The MAG that has connections from more than one LMA. The bMAG
      decides when it triggers the LMA handover and requests a previous
      LMA to initiate the LMA handover.
        
   Previous Local Mobility Anchor (PLMA):
      It is the topological anchor point that manages the MN's binding
      state before the LMA handover. The PLMA initiates to hand over the

      IP mobility session and forwards the context information of the 
      MN to the new target LMA. 
        
   New Local Mobility Anchor (NLMA):
      The LMA that receives the context information of the MN from the
      PLMA and maintains the MN's binding state after the LMA handover. 


4.  LMA Handovers for PMIPv6 Overview

   To deliver the context information of the MN from the PLMA to the
   NLMA efficiently, a LMA Handover Request (LMA_HO_Req) and a LMA
   Handover Response (LMA_HO_Resp) messages are exchanged between the
   bMAG and the PLMA. In the messages, MN'Identifier (MN ID), MN
   Link-layer Identifier (MN-LL-ID) and MN's Home Network Prefix
   (MN-HNP) are included.
   
   The reference network is illustrated in Figure 1.

4.1. Extended Policy Profile

   A MN's policy profile is stored in a local or a remote policy store.
   The mandatory fields of the policy profile are the MN ID and the LMA
   Address (LMAA). In this document, the LMAA field includes the address
   (NLMAA) of the LMA currently serving the MN. The optional fields of
   the policy profile is extended with the PLMAA field to include the
   address of the PLMA.
 

4.2.  Protocol Operation

   The sequence of events illustrating the LMA handover is shown in 
   Figure 2.
   
   The detailed description is as follows:

   (a)  The MN detects a new link and reports the identifications of 
        itself (MN ID) and the access point (New AP ID) to which the MN 
        is most likely to move. The detection mechanism of a new subnet
        link of a MN is specific to the access link between the MN and
        the MAG and it is out of the scope of this document.
 
   (b)  The bMAG sends a LMA_HO_Req message to the PLMA to initiate the
        LMA handover.

   (c)  The PLMA selects the NLMA and sends a LMA_HO_Init message with
        the context information of the MN to the NLMA. The PLMA is
        assumed to maintain the information on the other LMAs in the
        same PMIPv6 domain, such as the message exchanges between LMAs,
        the external information input and the reception of the
        information from the AAA/Policy store. However, this is out of
        the scope of this document.
    
   (d)  The NLMA received the LMA_HO_Init message creates a bind cache
        entry (BCE) of the corresponding MN and, then, a bi-directional
        tunnel is set up between the PLMA and the NLMA by sending
        a LMA_HAck message to the PLMA.
    
   (e)  The PLMA notifies bMAG of the completion of the context transfer
        regarding the MN from the PLMA to the NLMA by sending a 
        LMA_HO_Resp message to the bMAG.
     
   (f)  The bMAG initiates the tunnel setup between the bMAG and the
        NLMA by sending a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the
        NLMA.

   (g)  The NLMA sends an Update message to the remote policy store to

Internet-Draft      LMA Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6     October 2009

    
   (i)  The bi-directional tunnel between the bMAG and the NLMA is
        completely established by the NLMA's sending a Proxy Binding
        Acknowledgement (PBA) message to the bMAG.
     
   (j)  The data downloaded from the correspondent node (CN) arrives at
        the PLMA which is the topological anchor point of the MN, and 
        the PLMA forwards the downloaded data to the NLMA through the 
        tunnel between them. Then, the NLMA sends the data to the MN via 
        the bMAG. For the efficiency of the data delivery, it is
        possible to consider the route optimization additionally.

   (k)  The data uploaded from the MN to the CN are delivered to the CN
        via the bMAG and the NLMA in that order.


5.  Other Considerations

   Security issues for this document follow those for PMIPv6 [RFC5213]. 
   In PMIPv6, the MAG and LMA are assumed to share security
   associations. This document also assumes that the LMAs that
   participate in handover have adequate prior agreement and trust
   relationship between each other.

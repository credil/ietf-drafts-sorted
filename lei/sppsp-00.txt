   1. Introduction

   Peer-to-Peer streaming becomes popular in recent years because on the
   one hand it doesn't rely on the deployment of IP-multicast protocol,
   and on the other hand the data transmission among peers significantly
   reduce the bandwidth cost of the server, high scalability could then
   be achieved. Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) [1] is proposed
   to standardize this effort.

   Just as the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [1] provides
   security and protection for RTP and RTCP traffic, the Secure Peer-to-
   Peer Streaming Protocol (SPPSP), an extension of the Peer-to-Peer
   Streaming Protocol (PPSP), provides confidentiality, message
   authentication, and content protection to the PPSP traffic.

   SPPSP provides a framework for encryption and message authentication
   of PPSP streams. SPPSP defines a set of default group key
   cryptographic protocols (Sections 4), and it allows new cryptographic
   protocols to be introduced in the future.  With appropriate key

   management, SPPSP is secure (Section 9) for P2P real time streaming
   and P2P video on demand applications. SPPSP can achieve high
   throughput and low packet expansion. SPPSP provides suitable
   protection for heterogeneous environments in Layered P2P streaming
   [15](for example, with mobile phones, STB, and PC on the wired and
   wireless networks).

   A challenge for secure P2P streaming lies in the fact that streaming
   data comes from many different peers of dynamic nature and server
   (tracker server) who responds to a peer request for streaming content
   with only a list of peers. It does not guarantee either the security
   or the performance of the peers. Hence, secure P2P streaming has two
   important parts: 1) the communication between peer and tracker
   server; 2) the communication among the peers.

   The secure communication between peer and tracker server follows
   standard secure client server communication framework (e.g. reference
   framework RFC 2401 - Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol
   [8], and RFCs describing the Authentication Header (AH) [10] and
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)[11] protocols.

   Key management for the tracker/peer communication may use existing
   standards, for example, RFCs on "The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"
   [12], "Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol
   (ISAKMP)" [13], and "The OAKLEY Key Determination Protocol" [14].

   In addition to the secure client server communication, SPPSP adds the
   important secure group communications among the peers. For
   simplicity, we assume that each peer uses the same private key for
   peer communication, as well as communication with tracker server.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

   Group Key: a cryptographic key that is shared between a group of
   users. Typically, group keys are distributed by sending them to
   individual users, either physically, or encrypted individually for
   each user using either that user's pre-distributed private key;

   Group Mask: mask out the intended recipients among a group that a
   peer tries to send messages to;

   Symmetric Key Algorithm (SKA): use a single secret key shared by
   sender and receiver for both encryption and decryption. The sender
   and receiver must securely share a key in advance;

   Asymmetric Key Algorithm (AKA): does not require a secure initial
   exchange of secret keys to both sender and receiver. AKA creates a
   cryptographically related key pair: a secret private key and a
   published public key. Use of these keys allows protection of the
   authenticity of a message by creating a digital signature of a
   message using the private key, which can be verified using the public
   key. It also allows protection of the confidentiality and integrity
   of a message, by public key encryption, encrypting the message using
   the public key, which can only be decrypted using the private key;

   Group Asymmetric Key Cryptographic (GAKC): Asymmetric Key
   Cryptographic algorithm for a group of users to exchange messages
   securely and confidentially.



   3. Goals and Features

   The security goals for SPPSP are to ensure: 1) the confidentiality of
   the PPSP payloads, and 2) authentication of the peer users. These
   security services are optional and independent from each other. Some
   may be more important than others. For example, SPPSP authentication
   and integrity protection may be mandatory for communications between
   tracker server and peers (as malicious or erroneous alteration of
   tracker messages could otherwise disrupt the whole P2P system).

  Other functional goals for the protocol include:

     - A framework that permits upgrading with new cryptographic
     algorithms
     - Low bandwidth cost, i.e., a framework preserving PPSP header
     compression efficiency
     - Low computational cost (for standardized part)

Internet-Draft      Secure P2P Streaming Protocol           April 2010


     - Small footprint (i.e., small code size and data memory)
     - Limited packet expansion to support the bandwidth efficiency
     - Independence from the underlying transport, network, and physical
     layers used by PPSP, in particular high tolerance to packet loss,
     delay, and re-ordering

     These properties follow closely to those specified in RFC 3711
     Secure Real Time Transport Protocol [5] to ensure that SPPSP is a
     suitable protection scheme for P2P streaming under heterogeneous
     environment [15].


3.1. Features

      In addition to those goals introduced in SRTP, by nature of P2P
   communication, SPPSP will need to address Group Asymmetric Key
   Cryptographic, i.e., the secure communications among a peer group who
   are exchanging control messages and content data. They include:

     - A single "private key" can be used for confidentiality and
     integrity protection, both for tracker-peer and peer-peer
     communications.  This is achieved with a key derivation function,
     providing "session keys" for the respective payload of the
     communication session, securely derived from Group Asymmetric Key
     Cryptographic (GAKC) using cryptographic primitives including
     public key, group mask and GAKC parameters.

     - In addition, the key derivation can be configured to periodically
     refresh the session keys, which limits the amount of ciphertext
     produced by a fixed key, available for an adversary to cryptanalyze.

     - On the fly revoking or suspending access rights of one or any
     number of peers by updating the GAKC parameters at the tracker
     server, for example, update Group Mask (GM) so that certain peers
     can be mask in or mask out on the fly.

   4. SPPSP Framework

   A common use of group keys is to allow a group of users to decrypt a
   broadcast message that is intended for that entire group of users,
   and no-one else.

   In many applications, group keys are commonly used in conditional
   access systems, where the key is the common key used to decrypt the
   broadcast signal, and the group in question is the group of all
   paying subscribers. In this case, the group key is typically
   distributed to the subscribers' receivers using a combination of a
   physically-distributed secure cryptoprocessor in the form of a
   smartcard and encrypted over-the-air messages.

   This document does not cover the key distribution mechanism, which
   assumes that such key infrastructure has been established before the
   actual P2P streaming session. For example, in a commercial deployment,
   a dedicated private Key (pi) can be assigned to each STB at the
   factory floor. At the time the paid service is activated, such
   private Key can be enabled by the service provider. Similarly, for PC
   users and mobile phone users, they are uniquely assigned via secure
   key-exchange infrastructure. The specific methods are beyond the
   scope of the SPPSP protocol.

   We assume that a cryptographic pairing of public Key (PK) and a list
   of private Keys (pi) where i=1,...,N for some large natural number N.
   A Group Mask (S) with dimension N indicating a membership of (pi)s
   with i-th index having value 1 for members and 0 for non-members. It
   is clear that GM S can easily mask-in or mark-out one or any number
   of members by changing its values at the corresponding index
   positions.

   A Group Asymmetric Key Cryptographic (GAKC) transform can encrypt a
   "session key" using PK, pi, S and GAKC parameters into a "ciphertext"
   such that only peers who are members in S can decrypt the "session
   key" from the received "ciphertext". Non-members cannot decrypt the
   "session key" even if they receive the same data.

   "Session key" will be used to encrypt the message "payload", which
   will be sent to peers together with "ciphertext" using the standard
   PPSP data format.

   SPPSP can be defined as an extension of PPSP. Except where explicitly
   noted, all aspects of PPSP apply, with the addition of the SPPSP
   security features. Conceptually, we can consider SPPSP to be a "bump
   in the stack" implementation which resides between the PPSP
   application and the transport layer. SPPSP intercepts PPSP packets
   and then forwards an equivalent SPPSP packet on the sending side, and
   intercepts SPPSP packets and passes an equivalent PPSP packet up the
   stack on the receiving side.



   Secure P2P architecture is extended from the P2P streaming (PPSP)[3]
   with modification of adding public key PK, private keys {pi}, Group
   Mask S, and GAKC parameters to meet the secure P2P streaming
   requirement.

   For communications between tracker server and peer, each content with
   its unique Swarm ID will have corresponding public key PK_ID, {pi}
   list, and GAKC parameters, which have been pre-computed via a GAKC
   transformation. If tracker communicates with peer_i directly, Group
   Mask S by default can be S_i which is 1 at i-th index and 0 for other
   index places. Peers joining content with Swarm ID can use its
   corresponding PK_ID and GAKC parameters for encrypt/decrypt the
   "session key". Such session keys are used to encrypt the actual
   content (in this case, returned peer list or any other messages
   exchanged between tracker and peers) using any existing symmetric
   cryptographic key algorithm, e.g. AES [6];

   Similarly, for communications between peers, all peers on the content
   Swarm ID will use the corresponding public key PK_ID and the
   corresponding GAKC parameters, which have been pre-computed via a
   GAKC transformation and distributed properly beforehand. Peers will

   use this PK_ID, group mask S for intended peers, and GAKC parameters
   for encrypt/decrypt the "session key". Such session keys are used to
   encrypt the actual content (in this case, the data payload, buffer
   map and/or any other messages exchanged among the peers) using any
   existing symmetric cryptographic key algorithm, e.g. AES [6];

      The "Encrypted Payload" of an SPPSP packet consists of the
   encryption of the PPSP payload of the equivalent PPSP packet. The
   Encrypted Session Key portion may not be present in every SPPSP
   packet. For example, session key contained in previous packets can be
   reused. This will save the cost. For a session update (or re-keying)

   for example serve disabling certain peers by update the mask,
   Encrypted Session Key portion will have to be sent.




4.2. SPPSP Cryptographic Contexts

   Each SPPSP stream session requires all the participating parties
   (including tracker and all peers) to maintain the cryptographic state
   information corresponding to the content Swarm ID. This information
   is called the "cryptographic context". For example, the PK_ID, all
   potential peers' private key {pi} list, group mask S, and GAKC
   parameters.

   SPPSP uses two types of keys: session keys and private keys. By a
   "session key", we mean a key which is used directly in a
   cryptographic transform (e.g., encryption of data payload or
   messages). It can be changed on the fly.

   The "private key" for a peer is fixed via GAKC pre-computation and
   stored for the given peer. Tracker server or other peers use
   asymmetric cryptographic transformation to encrypt the "session key".
   Whether or not a certain peer has the capability to decrypt the
   ciphertext to get the "session key" is dictated by the Group Mask S.
   For example, if peer i subscribes to a certain content (be a paid
   customer), index i will have value 1 in S, hence peer i can obtain
   the session key using its private key and the GAKC parameters.

   This is very important because peers have no way of knowing if other
   peers have the rights to view the content or not, only server has
   such knowledge. With SPPSP, peers need not care about who has rights
   to view what content, because all the accessibility information is
   built into each SPPSP packet.



4.3. SPPSP Packet Processing

   The sender peer SHALL do the following to construct an SPPSP packet:

   - Determine which cryptographic context to use.

Internet-Draft      Secure P2P Streaming Protocol           April 2010


   - Construct PPSP packet as specified in PPSP protocol, and determine
   the payload data.

   - Determine the PK_ID

   - Determine the session key to be used.

   - Encrypt the PPSP payload to produce the Encrypted Portion of the
   packet using AES (or any symmetric key algorithm).

   - Determine the group mask S

   - Encrypt the session key to generate the ciphertext portion of the
   packet.


     To decrypt an SPPSP packet, the receiver peer SHALL do the reverse
   of the above steps.


   5. Pre-Defined Cryptographic Transforms



5.1. Encryption

   The default cipher is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)[6].



5.2. Null Cipher

   The NULL cipher means no confidentiality is needed. The SPPSP packet
   becomes the same as PPSP packet with no encryption for the payload.
   For example, this can be the case for free content with access to all
   the peers.



5.3. Message Authentication and Integrity

   Authentication is needed when receiving peer needs to make sure the
   packets are from the right source (right peers or tracker server).
   And it shall be supported by the GAKC mechanism.

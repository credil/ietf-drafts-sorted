1.  Introduction

   Smart meters that form a constrained wireless network need an
   application protocol that allows the efficient transmission of
   metering data.  The meters used to build such networks are usually
   equipped with low-cost and low-power hardware.  This leads to
   constraints in computational capacities, available memory and
   networking resources.

   The devices are often battery powered and are expected to run for a
   long time without having the possibility to re-charge themselves.  In
   order to save energy, smart meters often power off their wireless
   network device.  Hence, they don't have a steady network connection,
   but are only part of the wireless network as needed when there is
   data to transmit.  A push protocol like Compressed IPFIX, where data
   is transmitted from the meters to one or more collectors, is suitable
   for reporting metering data in such networks.

   Compressed IPFIX is derived from IPFIX [RFC5101] and therefore
   inherits most of its properties.  One of them is the separation of
   data and its data description by encoding the former in Data Sets and
   the latter in Template Sets.

   Transforming Compressed IPFIX to IPFIX as per [RFC5101] is very
   simple and can be done on the border between the constrained network
   and the more general network.  The transformation between one form of
   IPFIX data into another is known as IPFIX Mediation [IPFIX-MD-PS].
   Hence, smart metering networks that are based on Compressed IPFIX can
   be easily integrated into an existing IPFIX measurement
   infrastructure.

1.1.  Document structure

   Section 2 introduces the used terminology in this draft.  Afterwards,
   hardware and software constraints in constrained networks, which will
   motivate our modifications to the IPFIX protocol, are discussed in
   Section 3.  Section 4 describes the application scenarios and
   Section 5 describes the architecture for Compressed IPFIX.  Section 6
   defines the Compressed IPFIX protocol itself and discusses the
   differences between Compressed IPFIX and IPFIX.  The Mediation
   Process from Compressed IPFIX to IPFIX is described in Section 7.
   Section 8 defines the process of Template Management on the Exporter
   and the Collector.  Section 9 and Section 10 discuss the security and
   IANA considerations for Compressed IPFIX.  Section 11 lists the open
   issues that need to be addressed in further versions of this draft.

2.  Terminology

   The term smart meter is used to refer to constrained devices like
   wireless senor nodes, motes or any other kind of small constraint
   device that can be part of a network that is based on IEEE802.15.4
   and 6LoWPAN [RFC4944].

   Most of the terms used in this draft are defined in [RFC5101].  All
   these terms are written with their first letter being capitalized.
   Most of the terms that are defined for IPFIX can be used to describe
   Compressed IPFIX.  The term "Compressed" is used in front of the
   IPFIX term to distinguish between the IPFIX version and the
   Compressed IPFIX version.  This draft uses the term IPFIX to refer to
   IPFIX as per RFC 5101 and the term Compressed IPFIX for the IPFIX
   version defined in this draft.

   The terms IPFIX Message, IPFIX Device, Set, Data Set, Template Set,
   Data Record, Template Record, Collecting Process, Collector,
   Exporting Process and Exporter are defined as in [RFC5101].  The term
   IPFIX Mediator is defined in [IPFIX-MD-PS].  The terms Intermediate
   Process, IPFIX Proxy, IPFIX Concentrator are defined in
   [IPFIX-MD-FW].

   All these terms above have been adapted from the IPFIX definitions.
   As they keep a similar notion but in a different context of
   constrained networks, the term "Compressed" now complements the
   defined terms.

   Compressed Exporting Process

      The Compressed Exporting Process is a process that exports
      Compressed Records.

   Compressed Exporter

      A Compressed Exporter is a device that contains at least one
      Compressed Exporting Process.

   Compressed Collecting Process

      The Compressed Collecting Process is a process inside an Sensor
      that is able to collect Compressed Records.

   Compressed IPFIX Collector

      A Compressed Collector is a device that contains at least one
      Compressed Collecting Process.

   Compressed IPFIX Device

      A Compressed IPFIX Device is a device that contains one or more
      Compressed Collector or one or more Compressed Exporter.

   Compressed IPFIX Sensor

      Is smart meter that contains the functionality of an Compressed
      IPFIX Device.  A Compressed IPFIX Sensor is usually equipped with
      one or more sensors that meter a physical quantity, like
      temperature.  Every Compressed IPFIX Sensor MUST at least contain
      an Compressed Exporting Process.  It MAY contain a Compressed
      Collecting Process in order to work as a Compressed IPFIX Proxy or
      Concentrator.

   Compressed IPFIX Message

      The Compressed IPFIX Message is a message originated by an
      Compressed IPFIX Exporter.  It is composed of a Compressed Message
      Header and one or more Compressed Sets.  The Compressed IPFIX
      Message Format is defined in Section 6.

   Compressed Data Record

      A Compressed Data Record equals a Data Record in [RFC5101].  The
      term is used to distinguish between IPFIX and Compressed IPFIX
      throughout the document.

   Compressed Template Record

      A Compressed Template Record is similar to a Template Record.  The
      Template Record Header is substituted with a Compressed Template
      Record Header and is otherwise equal to a Template Record.
      Section 6.3.

   Compressed Set

      The Compressed Set is a group of Compressed Data Records or
      Compressed Template Records with a Compressed Set Header.  Its
      format is defined in Section 6.2.

   Compressed Data Set

      The Compressed Data Set is a Compressed Set that contains
      Compressed Data Records. in Section 6.2.

Internet-Draft              Compressed IPFIX                  March 2010


   Compressed Template Set

      A Compressed Template Set is a Compressed Set that contains
      Compressed Template Records.

   Compressed Intermediate Process

      A Compressed Intermediate Process is an Intermediate Process that
      can handle Compressed IPFIX Messages.

   Compressed IPFIX Proxy

      A Compressed IPFIX Proxy is an IPFIX Proxy that can handle
      Compressed IPFIX Messages.

   Compressed IPFIX Concentrator

      A Compressed IPFIX Concentrator is an IPFIX Concentrator that can
      handle Compressed IPFIX Messages.


   A Compressed IPFIX Transport Session is defined by the communication
   between a Compressed Exporter (identified by an 6LowPAN-Address, the
   Transport Protocol, and the Transport Port) and a Compressed
   Collector (identified by the same properties).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Hard- and Software constraints

3.1.  Hardware constraints

   The target devices for Compressed IPFIX are usually equipped with
   low-cost hardware and therefore face several constraints concerning
   CPU and memory [Schmitt09].  For example, the IRIS mote from Crossbow
   Technologies Inc. has a size of 58 x 32 x 7 mm (without a battery
   pack) [Crossbow].  Thus, there is little space for micro controller,
   flash memory (128 kb) and radio frequency transceiver, which are
   located on the board.

   Network protocols used on such hardware need to respect these
   constraints.  They must be simple to implement using little code and
   little run time memory and should produce little overhead when
   encoding the application payload.

Internet-Draft              Compressed IPFIX                  March 2010


3.2.  Energy constraints

   Smart meters that are battery powered have hard energy constraints.
   [Schmitt09].  If they run out of power, their battery has to be
   changed, which means physical manipulation to the device is
   necessary.  Using as little energy as possible for network
   communication is therefore desired.

   A smart metering device can save a lot of energy, if it powers down
   its radio frequency transceiver.  Such devices do not have permanent
   network connectivity but are only part of the network as needed.  A
   push protocol, where only one side is sending data, is suitable for
   transmitting application data under such circumstances.  As the
   communication is unidirectional, a meter can completely power down
   its radio frequency transceivers as long as it does not have any data
   to sent.  If the metering device is able to keep a few measurements
   in memory, and if real time metering is not a requirement, the
   Compressed Data Records can be pushed less frequently.  Therefore,
   saving some more energy on the radio frequency transceivers.

3.3.  Packet size constraints

   Compressed IPFIX is supposed to be used in 6LoWPAN networks, which
   are based on IEEE 802.15.4 [RFC4944].  IEEE 802.15.4 defines a
   maximum frame size of 127 octets, which usually leaves 102 octets for
   user data.  IPv6 defines a minimum MTU of 1280 octets.  Fragmentation
   has to be implemented in order to transmit such large packets.  While
   fragmentation allows the transmission of large messages, its use is
   problematic in networks with high packet loss because the complete
   message has to be discarded if only a single fragment gets lost.

   Compressed IPFIX enhances IPFIX by a header compression scheme, which
   allows to reduce the overhead from header sizes significantly.
   Additionally, the overall Compressed IPFIX Message size is reduced,
   which reduces the need for fragmentation.

3.4.  Transport protocol constraints

   The IPFIX standard [RFC5101] defines several transport protocol
   bindings for the transmission of IPFIX Messages.  SCTP support is
   REQUIRED for any IPFIX Device to achieve standard conformance
   [RFC5101].  However, sending IPFIX over UDP and TCP may also be
   implemented.  SCTP is the recommended protocol for IPFIX.

   This transport protocol recommendation is not suitable for Compressed
   IPFIX.  A header compression scheme that allows to compress an IPv6
   header from 40 octets down to 2 octets is defined in 6LoWPAN.  There
   is a similar compression scheme for UDP, but there is no such



Braun, et al.               Compressed IPFIX                    [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              Compressed IPFIX                  March 2010


   compression for TCP or SCTP headers.  If header compression can be
   employed, more space for application payload is available.

   Using UDP on the transport layer for transmitting IPFIX Messages is
   therefore highly recommended.  Furthermore, TCP or SCTP are currently
   not supported on some platforms, like on TinyOS [Harvan08].  Hence,
   UDP may be the only option.

   Every Compressed IPFIX Exporter and Collector MUST implement UDP
   transport layer support.  It MAY also offer TCP or SCTP support.
   However, using these protocols is NOT RECOMMENDED as their use will
   consume more power and reduces the available size of application
   payload compared to the use of UDP.  If Compressed IPFIX is
   transmitted over a non-constrained network, using SCTP as a transport
   layer protocol is RECOMMENDED.


4.  Application scenarios for Compressed IPFIX

   Compressed IPFIX is derived from IPFIX [RFC5101] and is therefore a
   push protocol.  This means all communication that employs Compressed
   IPFIX is unidirectional.  Hence, Compressed IPFIX only fits for
   application scenarios where meters transmit data to one or more
   Collectors.

   If Compressed IPFIX is used over UDP, as recommended, packet loss can
   occur.  Furthermore, if an initial Template Message gets lost, and is
   therefore unknown to the Collector, all Data Sets that reference this
   Template cannot be decoded.  Hence, all these Messages are lost if
   they are not cached by the Collector.  It should be clear to an
   application developer, that Compressed IPFIX can only be used over
   UDP if these Compressed IPFIX Message losses are not a problem.

   Compressed IPFIX over UDP is especially not a suitable protocol for
   applications where sensor data trigger policy decisions or
   configuration updates for which packet loss is not tolerable.

   Applications that use smart sensors for accounting purposes for long
   time measurements can benefit from the use of Compressed IPFIX.  One
   application for IPFIX can be long term monitoring of large physical
   volumes.  In [Tolle05], Tolle et al. built a system for monitoring a
   "70-meter tall redwood tree, at a density interval of 5 minutes in
   time and 2 meters in space".  The sensor node infrastructure was
   deployed to measure the air temperature, relative humidity and
   photosynthetically active solar radiation over a long time period.

   Deploying Compressed IPFIX in such scenarios seems to be a good fit.
   The sensors of the IPFIX Sensors can be queried over several 5 minute



Braun, et al.               Compressed IPFIX                    [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              Compressed IPFIX                  March 2010


   time intervals and the query results can be aggregated into a single
   Compressed IPFIX Message.  As soon as enough query results are stored
   in the Compressed IPFIX Message, e.g. if the Compressed IPFIX Message
   size fills the available payload in a single IEEE 802.15.4 packet,
   the wireless transceiver can be activated and the Compressed IPFIX
   Message can be exported to a Compressed IPFIX Collector.

   Similar sensor networks have been built to monitor the habitat of
   animals, e.g. in the "Great Duck Island Project" [GreatDuck],
   [SMPC04].  The purpose of the sensor network was to monitor the birds
   by deploying sensors in and around their burrows.  The measured
   sensor data was collected and stored in a database for offline
   analysis and visualization.  Again, the sensors can perform their
   measurements periodically, aggregate the sensor data and export them
   to a Compressed IPFIX Collector.

   Other application scenarios for Compressed IPFIX could be
   applications where sensor networks are used for long term structural
   health monitoring in order to investigate long term weather
   conditions on the structure of a building.  For example, a smart
   metering network has been built to monitor the structural health of
   the Golden Gate Bridge [Kim07].  If a sensor network is deployed to
   perform a long term measurement of the structural integrity,
   Compressed IPFIX can be used to collect the sensor measurement data.

   If an application developer wants to decide whether to use Compressed
   IPFIX for transmitting data from smart meters, he must take the
   following considerations into account:

   1.  The application must require a push protocol.  It is not possible
       to request data from a smart meter.  The IPFIX Sensor decides for
       itself when to send its metering data.
   2.  The property above allows a IPFIX Sensor to turn off its wireless
       device in order to save energy, as it does not have to receive
       any data.
   3.  If real-time is not required, the application might benefit from
       accumulated several measurements into a single Compressed IPFIX
       Message.  Compressed IPFIX easily allows the aggregation of
       several into a single Compressed IPFIX Message (or a single
       packet).  This aggregation can happen on the IPFIX Sensor that
       aggregates several of its own measurements.  Or it can happen
       within a multi-hop wireless network where one IPFIX Proxy
       aggregates several Compressed IPFIX Messages into a single
       Compressed IPFIX Message before forwarding them.
   4.  The application must accept potential packet loss.  Compressed
       IPFIX only fits for applications where metering data is stored
       for accounting purposes and not for applications where the sensor
       data triggers configuration changes or policy decisions (except:

       if Message loss is acceptable for some reason).


5.  Architecture for Compressed IPFIX

   The Compressed IPFIX architecture is similar to the IPFIX
   architecture which is described in [RFC5470].  The most common
   deployment of IPFIX Sensors is shown in Figure 1.

      Figure 1: Direct transmission between sensors and applications

   An IPFIX Sensor queries its internal sensors to retrieve the sensor
   data.  It then encodes the results into a Compressed IPFIX Message
   and exports this Compressed IPFIX Message to one or more Compressed
   IPFIX Collectors.  The Compressed IPFIX Collector runs one or more
   applications that process the collected sensor data.  The Compressed
   IPFIX Collector can be deployed on non-constrained devices at the
   constrained network border.

   A second way to deploy IPFIX Sensors can employ aggregation on
   Compressed IPFIX Messages during their journey through the
   constrained network as shown in Figure 2.  This aggregation can be
   performed by special IPFIX Sensors that act as Compressed IPFIX

   the aggregation.

                 Figure 2: Aggregation on Compressed IPFIX

   IPFIX Sensors send their data to Compressed IPFIX Concentrator which
   needs to have enough storage space to store the incoming data.  It
   may also aggregate the incoming data with its own measurement data.
   The aggregated data can then be re-exported again to one or more
   Collectors.

   The last deployment, shown in Figure 3, employs another Compressed
   IPFIX Mediation process.

   Compressed IPFIX to IPFIX is described in Section 7.


6.  Compressed IPFIX Message Format

   A Compressed IFPIX Message starts with a Compressed Message Header,
   followed by one or more Compressed Sets.  The Compressed Sets can be
   any of the possible two types: Compressed Template Set and Compressed
   Data Set. An Compressed IPFIX Message MUST only contain one type of
   Compressed Set. The format of the Compressed IPFIX Message is shown
   in Figure 4

6.1.  Compressed IPFIX Message Header

   The Compressed IPFIX Message Header is derived from the IPFIX Message
   Header, with some optimization using field compression.  The IPFIX
   Message Header from [RFC5101] is shown in Figure 5.

                      Figure 5: IPFIX Message Header

   The length of the IPFIX Message Header is 16 octets and every IPFIX
   Message has to be started with it.  The Compressed IPFIX Message
   Header needs to be smaller due to the packet size constraints
   discussed in Section 3.3.  Compressed IPFIX introduces a Compressed
   IPFIX Message Header that has a smaller size.  The Compressed header
   consists of a fixed part of two octets and a variable length
   "Remaining Header" as shown in Figure 6.

                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


          Figure 6: Format of the Compressed IPFIX Message header

   The first part has a fixed length of two octets and consists of the
   "Version Field" (4 bit), the "Export Time Compression" (ETC) field (2
   bit), the "Sequence Number Compression" (SNC) field (2 bit) and the
   "Length" field (8 bit).  The second part (the "Remaining Header") has
   a variable length.  Its length is defined by the ETC and SNC fields
   in the fixed header.

   The fixed header has a length of two octets which equals the length
   of the version field of the IPFIX Message Header.  Hence, Compressed
   IPFIX Messages can be read and identified by an IPFIX Collector.
   This is important for building an IPFIX Mediator by extending an
   IPFIX Collector (Section 7).

   The fixed header fields are defined as follows:

   Version number

      The Compressed IPFIX version field MUST have the most significant
      bit set to one and the other bits set to zero.  The remaining bits
      of the version field are reserved for future versions of
      Compressed IPFIX.  Note that IPFIX has the version 0x000a, hence
      an IPFIX Collector can distinguish between IPFIX and Compressed
      IPFIX by checking the first bit of the version field.

Internet-Draft              Compressed IPFIX                  March 2010


   ETC

      The ETC field defines the compression level of the "Export Time"
      field of the IPFIX Messages Header.  Its value defines the length
      as follows.  A bit sequence of "00" denotes that the "Export Time"
      field is omitted.  A sequence of "01" denotes that the "Export
      Time" field has a size of one octet.  A sequence of "10" denotes
      that the "Export Time" field has a size of two octets.  Finally, a
      sequence of "11" denotes that the "Export Time" field has the
      original length of four octets.

   SNC

      The SNC field defines the compression level of the "Sequence
      Number" field of the IPFIX Messages Header.  Its value defines the
      length as follows.  A bit sequence of "00" denotes that the
      "Sequence Number" field is omitted.  A sequence of "01" denotes
      that the "Sequence Number" field has a size of one octet.  A
      sequence of "10" denotes that the "Sequence Number" field has a
      size of two octets.  Finally, a sequence of "11" denotes that the
      "Sequence Number" field has the original length of four octets.

   Length

      The length field has a fixed length of one octet.  Compressed
      IPFIX Messages therefore have a maximum length of 255 octets.

   An application SHOULD never send a Compressed IPFIX that is bigger
   than 102 octets to avoid fragmentation.  If the "Export Time" field
   is not omitted, it is placed directly behind the length field.  If
   the Export Time field has a size of four octets, it MUST contain the
   time in seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1, 1970, at which the Compressed
   IPFIX Message Header leaves the Exporter.  This complies with the
   "Export Time" field in IPFIX.

   Afterwards, the "Sequence Number" field is attached (if not omitted).
   If the field has a length of four bytes, it must contain the number
   of records sent since the start of the Exporter module 2^32 at the
   end of this Compressed IPFIX Message.  If the field is Compressed to
   one or two bytes, it must contain the number of IPFIX messages sent
   by the Exporter since its start modulo 2^8 or 2^16.

6.2.  Compressed Set

   A Compressed Set is a set of Compressed Template or Compressed Data
   Records.  Depending on the Compressed Record type, the Compressed Set
   can either be a Compressed Template Set or a Compressed Data Set.
   Every Compressed Set is started with an Compressed Set Header and is

Internet-Draft              Compressed IPFIX                  March 2010


   followed by one or more Compressed Records.

   The IPFIX Set Header consists of an two octet "Set ID" field and a
   two octet "Length" field.  These two fields are compressed to one
   octet each for the Compressed Set Header.  The format of the
   Compressed Set Header is shown in Figure 7.


   0                   1
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Comp. Set ID  |    Length     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                      Figure 7: Compressed Set Header

   The two fields are defined as follows:

   Compressed Set ID

      The "Compressed Set ID" (Comp.  Set ID) identifies the type of
      data that is transported in the Compressed Set. A Compressed
      Template Set is identified by Compressed Set ID 2.  This
      corresponds to the Set IDs that are used by Sets in IPFIX.
      Compressed Set ID number 3 MUST NOT be used.  All values from 4 to
      127 are reserved for future use.  Values above 127 are used for
      Compressed Data Sets.

   Length

      The "Length" Field contains the total length of the Compressed
      Set, including the Compressed Set Header.

6.3.  Compressed Template Record Format

   The format of the Compressed Template Records is shown in Figure 8.
   The Compressed Template Record starts with an Compressed Template
   Record Header and is followed by one or more Field Specifiers.  The
   Field Specifier format is defined as in Section 6.4 and is identical
   to the Field Specifier definition in [RFC5101].

   Compressed Template ID

      Each Compressed Template Record must have a unique Compressed
      Template ID (Comp.  Temp ID) between 128 and 255.  The Compressed
      Template ID must be unique for the given Compressed Transport
      Session.

   Field Count

      The number of fields placed in the Compressed Template Record.

6.4.  Field Specifier Format

   The type and length of the transmitted data is encoded in Field
   Specifiers within Compressed Template Records.  The Field Specifier
   is shown in Figure 10 and is identical with the Field Specifier that
   was defined for IPFIX [RFC5101].  The following text has been copied
   from [RFC5101] for completeness.

      Enterprise bit.  This is the first bit of the Field Specifier.  If
      this bit is zero, the Information Element Identifier identifies an
      IETF-specified Information Element, and the four-octet Enterprise
      Number field MUST NOT be present.  If this bit is one, the
      Information Element Identifier identifies an enterprise-specific
      Information Element, and the Enterprise Number field MUST be
      present.

   Information Element Identifier

      A numeric value that represents the type of Information Element.

   Field Length

      The length of the corresponding encoded Information Element, in
      octets.  Refer to [RFC5102].  The value 65535 is illegal as there
      are no variable size encoded elements as they are defined in
      IPFIX.

   Enterprise Number

      IANA [IANA] enterprise number of the authority defining the
      Information Element identifier in this Template Record.

   Vendors can easily define their own data model by registering a
   Enterprise ID with IANA.  Using their own Enterprise ID, they can use
   any ID in the way they want them to use.

6.5.  Compressed Data Record Format

   The Data Records are sent in Compressed Data Sets.  The format of the
   Data Records is shown in Figure 11 and matches the Data Record format
   from IPFIX.

7.  Compressed IPFIX Mediation

   There are two types of Compressed IPFIX Intermediate Processes.  The
   first one can occur on the transition between a constraint 6LoWPAN
   and the non-constrained network.  This mediation changes the network
   and transport protocol from 6LowPAN/UDP to IP/(SCTP|TCP|UDP) and is
   shown in Figure 12.

     Figure 12: Translation from Compressed IPFIX over 6LowPAN/UDP to
                  Compressed IPFIX over IP/(SCTP|TCP|UDP)

   The mediator removes the Compressed IPFIX Messages from the 6LowPAN/
   UDP packets and wraps them into the new network and transport
   protocols.  Templates MUST be managed the same way as in the
   constraint environment after the translation to IP/(SCTP|UDP|TCP)
   (see Section 8).

   The second type of mediation transforms Compressed IPFIX into IPFIX.

   This process MUST be combined with the transport protocol mediation

   This mediation can also be performed by an IPFIX Collector before
   parsing the IPFIX message as shown in Figure 14.  There is no need
   for a Compressed IPFIX parser if such a mediation process can be
   employed in front of an already existing IPFIX collector.

         Figure 14: Transformation from Compressed IPFIX to IPFIX

   The Compressed Mediation Process has to translate the Compressed
   IPFIX Message Header, the Compressed Set Headers and the Compressed
   Template Record Header into their counterparts in IPFIX Afterwards,
   the new IPFIX Message Length needs to be calculated and inserted into
   the IPFIX Message header.

7.1.  Expanding the Message header

   The fields of the IPFIX Message Header that are shown in Figure 5 can
   be determined as follows:

   Version

      This is always 0x000a.

   Length

      The IPFIX Message Length can only be calculated after the complete
      Compressed IPFIX Message has been translated.  The new length can
      be calculated by adding the length of the IPFIX Message Header,
      which is 16 octets, and the length of all Sets that are contained
      in the IPFIX Message.

   Export Time

      If the "Export Time" in the Compressed IPFIX Message Header has a
      length of 4 octets, the value from the Compressed Message Header
      MUST be used for the IPFIX Message Header.  If it was omitted, the
      "Export Time" MUST be generated by the Mediator.  If the IPFIX
      Message is exported again, the "Export Time" field MUST contain
      the time in seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1, 1970, at which the IPFIX
      Message leaves the Exporter.  If the Message is passed to an IPFIX
      Collector for decoding directly, the "Export Time" field is the
      time in seconds since 0000 UTC Jan 1 1970 at which the Compressed
      IPFIX Message has been received by the Compressed IPFIX Exporter.

   Sequence Number

      If the Compressed Sequence Number has a length of 4 octets, the
      original value MUST be used for the IPFIX Message.  If the
      Compressed Sequence Number has a size of one or two octets, the
      Compressed IPFIX Mediator MUST expand the Compressed Sequence
      Number into a four octet field.  If the Compressed Sequence Number
      was omitted, the Mediator needs to calculate the Sequence Number
      as per RFC 5101 [RFC5101].

   Observation Domain ID

      This is always 0 indicating to the IPFIX Collector, that the
      Observation Domain ID is not relevant.

Internet-Draft              Compressed IPFIX                  March 2010


7.2.  Translating the Set Headers

   Both fields in the Compressed Set Header have a size of one octet and
   need to be expanded:

   Set ID

      The field needs to be expanded from one octet to two octets.  If
      the Set ID is below 128, no recalculation needs to be performed.
      This is because all IDs below 128 are reserved for special
      messages and match the IDs used in IPFIX.  The Compressed Set IDs
      starting with 128 identify Data Sets.  Therefore, every Compressed
      Set ID above 127 needs to be incremented by 128 because IPFIX Data
      Set IDs are located above 255.

   Set Length

      The field needs to be expanded from one octet to two octets.  It
      needs to be recalculated by adding a value of 2 octet to match the
      additional size of the Set Header.  For each Compressed Template
      Record that is contained in the Compressed Set, 2 more octets need
      to be added to the length.

7.3.  Expanding the Template Record Header

   Both fields in the Compressed Template Record Header have a length of
   one octet and therefore need translation:

   Template ID

      The field needs to be expanded from one octet to two octets.  The
      Template ID needs to be increased by a value of 128.

   Field Count

      The field needs to be expanded from one octet to two octets.


8.  Template Management

   The way Compressed Templates have to be managed depends on the usd
   transport protocol.  If TCP or SCTP is used, it can be ensured that
   Compressed Templates are delivered reliably.  Template loss can occur
   on UDP on the other hand.  If a Template is lost on its way to the
   Collector, all following Compressed Data Records that refer to this
   Compressed Template cannot be decoded.





Braun, et al.               Compressed IPFIX                   [Page 22]

Internet-Draft              Compressed IPFIX                  March 2010


8.1.  TCP / SCTP

   If TCP or SCTP is an option and can be used for the transmission of
   Compressed IPFIX, Template Management MUST be performed as defined in
   [RFC5101] for IPFIX.

8.2.  UDP

   All specifications for Template management from [RFC5101] apply
   unless specified otherwise in this document.

   Compressed Templates MUST be sent by an Compressed Exporter before
   any Compressed Data Set that refers to the Compressed Template is
   transmitted.  Compressed Templates are not expected to change over
   time in Compressed IPFIX.  Hence, a Compressed Template that has been
   sent once MAY NOT be withdrawn and MUST NOT expire.  If an IPFIX
   Sensor wants to use another Compressed Template it MUST use a new
   Compressed Template ID for the Compressed Template.

   As UDP is used, reliable transport of Compressed Templates cannot be
   guaranteed and Compressed Templates can be lost.  A Compressed
   Exporter MUST expect Compressed Template loss.  It MUST therefore re-
   send its Compressed Templates periodically.  A Compressed Template
   MUST be re-send after a fixed number of N Compressed IPFIX Messages
   that contained Compressed Data Sets that referred to this Compressed
   Template.  The number N MUST be configured by the application
   developer.


9.  Security considerations

   The same security considerations as for the IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101]
   apply.


10.  IANA Considerations

   The same IANA considerations as for the IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101]
   apply.


11.  Open Issues

   1.  Export Time field value if the field is compressed to one or two
       bytes is unclear.
   2.  It is unclear how reserved IPFIX Set IDs above 127 can be
       handled, if they are standardized some day

Internet-Draft              Compressed IPFIX                  March 2010


   3.  Translating the one or two byte long Sequence Number from
       Compressed IPFIX to IPFIX has some pitfalls when packet loss
       occurs.
   4.  Option Templates need to be defined (they are forbidden right
       now)
   5.  Section on the Collector side (as in RFC 5101) is needed.

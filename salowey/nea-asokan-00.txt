1. Introduction

   The Network Endpoint Assessment protocols are subject to a subtle
   forwarding attack that has become known as the NEA Asokan Attack.
   This document describes the attack and countermeasures that may be
   mounted.

   This document is not intended to formally define a protocol but
   rather to explore the options for countering the Asokan attack. The
   NEA WG is expected to consider these options, decide which to
   select, and incorporate specific text defining that option into a
   Standards Track document. Then this document will be allowed to
   expire.

2. NEA Asokan Attack Explained

   The NEA Asokan Attack is a variation on an attack described in a
   2002 paper written by Asokan, Niemi, and Nyberg [1]. Figure 1
   depicts one version of the original Asokan attack. This attack

   involves tricking an authorized user into authenticating to a decoy
   AAA server, which forwards the authentication protocol from one
   tunnel to another, tricking a AAA server into believing these
   messages came from the attacker and granting access to him.

         Figure 1: One Example of Original Asokan Attack

   As described in the NEA Overview [2], the NEA Reference Model is
   composed of several nested protocols. The PA protocol is nested in
   the PB protocol, which is nested in the PT protocol. When used
   together successfully, these protocols allow a NEA Server to assess
   the security posture of an endpoint. The NEA Server may use this
   information to decide whether network access should be granted or
   for other purposes.

   Figure 2 illustrates a NEA Asokan Attack. The attacker wants to
   trick GoodServer into believing that DirtyEndpoint has good security
   posture. This might allow the attacker to bring an infected machine
   onto a network and infect others, for example. To accomplish this
   goal, the attacker forwards PA messages from CleanEndpoint through
   BadServer to DirtyEndpoint, which sends them on to GoodServer.
   GoodServer is tricked into thinking that the PA messages came from
   DirtyEndpoint and therefore considers DirtyEndpoint to be clean.

                            +-------------+ ========== +----------+
                            |DirtyEndpoint|-----PA-----|GoodServer|

   Countermeasures against a NEA Asokan Attack are described in section
   4.

3. Lying Endpoints

   Some may argue that there are other attacks against NEA systems that
   are simpler than the Asokan attack, such as lying endpoint attacks.
   That is true. It's easy for an endpoint to simply lie about its
   posture. But there are defenses against lying endpoint attacks, such
   as using an external measurement agent (EMA).

   An EMA is hardware, software, or firmware designed to accurately
   report on endpoint configuration but be especially secure and hard
   to compromise. The EMA observes and reports on critical aspects of
   endpoint posture such as which security-relevant firmware and
   software has been loaded.

   When an EMA is used for NEA, the PA messages that reliably and
   securely establish endpoint posture are exchanged between the EMA
   itself and a Posture Validator on the NEA Server. The Posture
   Collector on the endpoint and any other intermediaries between the
   EMA and the Posture Validator on the NEA Server are not trusted.
   They just pass messages along as untrusted intermediaries.

   To ensure that the EMA's messages are accurately conveyed to the
   Posture Validator even if the Posture Collector or other
   intermediaries have been compromised, these PA messages must provide
   integrity protection, replay protection, and source authentication
   between the EMA and the Posture Validator. Confidentiality
   protection is not needed, at least with respect to the software on
   the endpoint. But integrity protection should include protection
   against message deletion and session truncation. Organizations that
   have developed EMAs have typically developed remote attestation
   protocols that provide these properties. While the development of
   lying endpoint detection technologies is out of scope for NEA, these
   technologies must be supported by the NEA protocols.

4. Countermeasures Against The NEA Asokan Attack

4.1. Identity Binding

   One way to mitigate the Asokan attack is to bind the identities used
   in tunnel establishment into a cryptographic exchange at the PA
   layer.  While this can go a long way to preventing the attack it
   does not bind the exchange to a specific TLS exchange, which is
   desirable.  In addition, there is no standard way to extract an

Internet-Draft        NEA Asokan Attack Analysis           October 2010


   identity from a TLS session, which could make implementation
   difficult.

4.2. Cryptographic Binding

   One way to thwart the NEA Asokan Attack is for the PA exchange to be
   cryptographically bound to the PT exchange and to any keying
   material or privileges granted as a result of these two exchanges.
   This allows the NEA Server to ensure that the PA messages pertain to
   the same endpoint as the party terminating the PT exchange and that
   no other party gains any access or advantage from this exchange.

4.2.1. Binding Options

   This section discusses binding protocol solution options and
   provides analysis.   Since the proposals for both L2 and L3 PT
   involve TLS the document focuses on TLS based solutions that can
   work with either transport.

4.2.1.1. Information from the TLS Tunnel

   The TLS handshake establishes cryptographic state between the TLS
   client and TLS server.  There are several mechanisms that can be
   used to export information derived from this state.  The client and
   server independently include this information in calculations to
   bind the instance of the tunnel into the PA protocol.

   Keying Material Export - RFC 5705 [5] defines Keying Material
   Exporters for TLS that allow additional secret key material to be
   extracted from the TLS master secret.

   tls-unique Channel Binding Data - RFC 5929 [6] defines several
   quantities that can be extracted from the TLS session to bind the
   TLS session to other protocols.  The tls-unique binding consists of
   data extracted from the TLS handshake finished message.

4.2.1.2. TLS Cipher Suites

   In order to eliminate the possibility of a man-in-the-middle and
   thwart the Asokan attack it is important that neither TLS endpoint
   be in sole control of the TLS pre-master secret.   Cipher suites
   based on key transport such as RSA cipher suites do not meet this
   requirement, instead Diffie-Hellman Cipher Suites, such as RSA-DHE,
   are required when this mechanism is employed.

Internet-Draft        NEA Asokan Attack Analysis           October 2010


4.2.1.3. Using Additional Key Material from TLS

   In some cases key material is extracted from the TLS tunnel and used
   to derive ciphering keys used in another protocol.  For example,
   EAP-TLS [7] uses key material extracted from TLS in lower layer
   ciphering.  In this case the extracted keys must not be under the
   control of a single party so the considerations in the previous
   section are important.

4.2.1.4.  EMA assumptions

   The EMA needs to obtain the binding data from the TLS exchange and
   prove knowledge of the binding data in an exchange that has
   integrity protection, source authentication and replay protection.

5. Conclusions

   The recommendations for addressing the Asokan attack are as follows:

   1. Make use of cryptographic binding, however binding identities of
     the tunnel endpoints in the EMA may be useful.
   2. The same mechanism be used in L2 and L3 PT transports that make
     use of TLS.
   3. Neither TLS endpoint can be in sole control of the TLS pre-master
     secret.
   4. The preferred approach is to use secret key material exported from
     the TLS handshake using the mechanism defined in RFC 5705.  The
     key material is exported using a standardized label and made
     available to the EMA that will use it.



6. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

7. Security Considerations

   This document is primarily concerned with analyzing and proposing
   countermeasures for the NEA Asokan Attack. That does not mean that
   it covers all the possible attacks against the NEA protocols or
   against the NEA Reference Model. For a broader security analysis,
   see the Security Considerations section of the NEA Overview [2], PA-
   TNC [3], and PB-TNC [4].

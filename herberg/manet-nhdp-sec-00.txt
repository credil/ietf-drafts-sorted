Internet-Draft     Cryptographical Signatures in NHDP      November 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document describes how to use cryptographic signatures for
   countering a selection of the security threats analyzed in
   [NHDP-sec-threats].  It specifies the use of such signatures for
   validating the identity of the originator of a HELLO message, the
   validity of the content (i.e. links being advertised) of a HELLO
   message, and the message integrity.  The protection so offered
   against the threats in [NHDP-sec-threats] is evaluated.

   This document specifies TLVs for carrying cryptographic signatures in
   HELLO messages using [RFC5444], and specifies extensions (as enabled
   by [NHDP]) to the HELLO message processing in [NHDP].


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology of [RFC5444], [packetbb-sec],
   [NHDP] and [NHDP-sec-threats].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability Statement

   o  [NHDP] enables extensions to recognize additional reasons for
      rejecting a message as malformed, and mentions security as an
      explicit example.

   o  This document, therefore, elaborates on how this in details can be
      done, providing a framework for signing and validating messages in
      NHDP.

   o  Note that there is no "no one-size-fits-all", therefore this
      document uses the containers for carrying signatures and
      registries for cryptographic code-points as specified in
      [packetbb-sec].  The specification should therefore be generally
      be applicable where cryptographic signatures are thought an
      appropriate security solution.  Note that the the choice of the
      cryptographic algorithm are to be made for each given deployment
      and that the choice of such is out of scope for this document.

   o  This document does not specify how to distribute cryptographic
      keys, shared secrets, parameters for signature algorithms, etc.

Internet-Draft     Cryptographical Signatures in NHDP      November 2009


   o  Note also that this document assumes that a router which is able
      to sign messages correctly (e.g. having a valid cryptographic
      key), is considered trusted.  This document does not handle
      compromised routers with a valid key (e.g. a router that is
      compromised by a computer virus).

   Therefore:

   o  This document is generally applicable when [NHDP] is used, and
      uses the [RFC5444] extension specified in [packetbb-sec].


4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   The framework presented in this document provides two
   functionalities:

   o  Signing a HELLO message

   o  Checking whether a signed incoming HELLO message is valid

   When NHDP is about to transmit a HELLO message on an interface, this
   extension:

   o  specifies to calculate a digital signature of the message, and

   o  specifies how to add that signature to a message for transmission,
      by way of a SIGNATURE TLV/

   The framework allows to add several signatures with different hash
   and cryptographic functions.

   [NHDP] allows to reject incoming HELLO messages prior to processing
   by NHDP for reasons such as invalid signatures.  This extension
   specifies that for each SIGNATURE TLV in the Message TLV Block of
   that incoming message, the value of that TLV (i.e. the contained
   signature) is verified.


5.  Transmitting a message in NHDP

   HELLO messages are generated as specified in [NHDP].  In addition,
   each HELLO message MUST set the <msg-orig-addr> as well as the <msg-
   seq-num> field as specified in [RFC5444].  Before transmission of a
   message, it is signed as described in Section 6.

Internet-Draft     Cryptographical Signatures in NHDP      November 2009


6.  Signing a Message

   This section specifies how to sign a message.  Note that a message
   may be signed several times using different signature algorithms.
   The following constraints MUST be respected when signing a message:

   o  The originator address of the message MUST be included.

   o  The sequence number of the message MUST be included.

   Optionally:

   o  A TIMESTAMP TLV (as defined in [packetbb-sec]) MAY be added to the
      message if no such TLV is already included in the message TLV
      block of that message.  The value of the TIMESTAMP TLV is the
      current POSIX timestamp (32-bit) of the router, and the type
      extension is 1 (one).

   For each signature algorithm that is used to sign the message:

   1.  All TLVs of type SIGNATURE are temporarily removed from the
       message and stored in temporary variables.  The message size is
       recalculated accordingly, i.e. to the size of the message without
       the SIGNATURE TLVs.

   2.  The signature value is calculated over the whole message (as
       resulting after step 1) according to the chosen signature
       algorithm.

   3.  A TLV of type SIGNATURE is added in the message TLV block.  The
       TLV value is set to the signature calculated in step 2 as well as
       the chosen hash and cryptographic algorithms.

   4.  All other SIGNATURE TLVs that have been temporary removed, are
       restored.

   5.  The message size is recalculated.


7.  Processing a Message in NHDP

   NHDP specifies that

      "On receiving a HELLO message, a router MUST first check if the
      message is invalid for processing by this router"

   and gives a number of conditions that will lead to a rejection of the
   HELLO message if any of these conditions is true.  The extension

Internet-Draft     Cryptographical Signatures in NHDP      November 2009


   specified in this document adds the following conditions for
   rejecting a message:

   o  The message does not include the <msg-orig-addr> or the <msg-seq-
      num> field.

   o  The message contains more than one TIMESTAMP TLV.

   o  Any signature of the message is invalid as specified in Section 9.

   o  The timestamp of the message is invalid as specified in Section 8.


8.  Validating a Timestamp

   This section specifies how to validate a message timestamp.

   1.  If the message includes a TIMESTAMP Message TLV, and the value of
       the TIMESTAMP TLV differs from the current POSIX time of more
       than MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF, the message MUST be discarded.


9.  Validating a Signature

   This section specifies how to validate a message signature.

   1.  For all SIGNATURE Message TLVs:

       A.  If the hash function and the cryptographic function defined
           in that are known to the router: goto step 2.

       B.  Otherwise goto step 1

   2.  If no signature algorithm has been recognized in step 1, the
       message MUST be discarded.

   3.  All SIGNATURE TLVs are removed from the message, and the message
       size is recalculated.

   4.  The signature is recalculated using the same hash function and
       cryptographic function as indicated in the TLV, and compared with
       the signature from the SIGNATURE TLV that has been removed in
       step 3.

   5.  If the verification fails, the message MUST be discarded.

   6.  Otherwise:

Internet-Draft     Cryptographical Signatures in NHDP      November 2009


       A.  Restore all SIGNATURE TLVs.

       B.  Restore the message size.

   7.  The message can now be processed according to [NHDP].


10.  Parameters and Constants

   This document specifies the following parameters and constants:

   o  MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF - The maximum age a message that is to be
      validated may have.  If the current POSIX time of the router
      validating the message minus the timestamp indicated in the
      TIMESTAMP TLV of the message is greater than MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF,
      the message will be discarded.

   The following constraints apply to these parameters:

   o  MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF > 0


11.  Preconditions

   Before a router is able to sign or validate messages, it must
   initially parameterize some security settings.  In particular, it
   MUST acquire the cryptographic key(s) and any parameters of the
   cryptographic algorithm from all other routers that are to
   participate in the network.  This document does not specify how a
   router acquires the cryptographic keys and parameters used in the
   MANET.


12.  Summary of NHDP Interaction

   When the security mechanisms as specified in this document is used,
   the following MUST be observed:

   o  NHDP must generate HELLO messages as usual.

   o  NHDP MUST allow this security mechanism access to the HELLO
      message after its generation and prior to transmission, in order
      that a SIGNATURE TLV can be generated and inserted, as allowed by
      Section 16 in [NHDP].

   o  Any other NHDP extension which adds information to a HELLO message
      and which wishes this added information to be included when
      calculating the cryptographic signature MUST do so prior to the

Internet-Draft     Cryptographical Signatures in NHDP      November 2009


      HELLO message being handed off for signature generation.

   o  An incoming HELLO message MUST be processed according to this
      specification prior to processing by [NHDP] as allowed in Section
      16 in [NHDP].

   o  Any other NHDP extension, which has added information to a HELLO
      message and which wishes that the HELLO message is rejected if a
      cryptographic signature is not valid, MUST likewise process the
      HELLO message only after its processing according to this
      specification.


13.  Security Threats Alleviation Analysis

   This section analyzes which of the security threats that are detailed
   in [NHDP-sec-threats] are alleviated by the framework presented in
   this document.

13.1.  Jamming

   Since jamming is a physical layer issue, it cannot be alleviated by
   protocols on the routing layer.  This framework does not counteract
   jamming attacks, therefore.

13.2.  Identity Spoofing

   As only routers possessing a valid cryptographic keys are able to
   sign correctly HELLO messages, identity spoofing is counteracted.  If
   a router does not have access to a valid key or does not sign
   messages at all, it is not able to create HELLOs that are processed
   by neighbor routers.  Such wrongly signed or unsigned messages are
   rejected by receiving routers as described in Section 9.

13.3.  Link Spoofing

   Link spoofing is counteracted by the framework specified in this
   draft, with the same argument as in Section 13.2.  A router without
   access to a valid cryptographic key cannot sign the message
   correctly, and therefore the message will be rejected by any
   receiving routers.  Hence, all links postulated by an attacker are
   ignored.

13.4.  Replay Attack

   Replay attacks are only counteracted if TIMESTAMP TLVs are included
   in HELLO messages.  This is optional, and depends on synchronized
   clocks of all routers in the MANET.  An attacker which records



Herberg & Clausen         Expires May 16, 2010                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     Cryptographical Signatures in NHDP      November 2009


   messages to replay them later can only do so in the time interval
   between the timestamp that is contained in the TIMESTAMP TLV and
   MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF seconds later.  As an attacker cannot modify the
   content if the TIMESTAMP TLV (since it does not possess the valid
   cryptographic key), it cannot replay messages after this time
   interval.  Within this time interval, however, it is still possible
   to replay attacks.


14.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


15.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a protocol extension to NHDP which allows to
   alleviate some of the security threats of NHDP analyzed in
   [NHDP-sec-threats].

   If no synchronized clocks are available in the MANET, replay attacks
   cannot be counteracted by this framework.

   This framework does not avoid or detect security attacks by routers
   possessing the cryptographic key that is used to sign messages.

   This specification depends on the quality of the used signature
   algorithm and provides as such the same security considerations as
   the hash function and the cipher algorithm.

   This specification relies on an out-of-band protocol to distribute
   keys and parameters.  The security considerations of that protocol
   apply.

   This specification does not provide a key revocation mechanism.

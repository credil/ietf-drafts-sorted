                     RFC 4389 Should be a Standard
                   draft-wbeebee-6man-nd-proxy-std-00

Abstract

   Increasingly the need for IPv6 ND Proxy [RFC4389]) to be a Standards
   Track document is growing.  During the specification of the IPv6 CE
   Router in the IETF v6ops Working Group, the IPv6 CE Router has use
   for ND Proxy to bridge disparate MAC layers LAN ports.  There is also
   the use of ND Proxy in cable broadband NBMA network for DAD and ND
   address resolution on a cable access concentrator.  Another case
   where ND Proxy is required is when one does not have enough IPv6
   address space to route.  This short note recommends that the ND Proxy
   RFC be changed to a Standards Track document.

Internet-Draft                ND Proxy STD                 November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The reason IPV6 ND Proxy RFC as specified in [RFC4389] still exists
   in Experimental form is because when the RFC was completed the RFC
   still required work for SEND [RFC3971] extensions.  SEND came into
   being before the ND Proxy document, so it became a requirement for
   the new work in ND Proxy to support security extensions for SEND.
   The IETF CSI Working Group, amongst other things, was chartered to
   complete the SEND extensions for ND Proxy.  However, the work has
   still not be undertaken whereas ND Proxy is to be used in
   environments where SEND is not used


2.  Move ND Proxy to Standards Track

   The IPv6 CE Router document in
   draft-wbeebee-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router-bis
   [I-D.wbeebee-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router-bis] has recommended support for
   ND Proxy on the IPv6 CE Router.  A typical IPv6 CE Router is expected
   to support LAN hardware ports with disparate MAC layers and ND Proxy
   is recommended for communicating between the ports.  However, a v6ops
   document prefers not to recommend technology that is in Experimental
   form.  Further, the cable broadband IPv6 standards also recommend use
   of ND Proxy on the cable NBMA access concentrator and the same
   standards do not specify use of SEND.  As of 2007 at least two cable
   access concentrator vendors support ND Proxy.  In light of such
   facts, this document recommends that IETF move [RFC4389] from
   Experimental to Standards Track status.


3.  Security Considerations

   If a deployment chooses to use IPv6 ND Proxy without the use of SEND,
   then a deployment should be allowed to do so with security at their
   own risks.  A cable access concentrator is under the control of the
   Service Provider and if such a router supports ND Proxy, the security
   risk is limited due to an RF segment between the Service Provider and
   the cable modem and also the link is covered through the use of
   Baseline Privacy Interface security in cable standards.


4.  IANA Considerations

   None.

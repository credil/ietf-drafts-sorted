Abstract

   This document describes the use of the Camellia block cipher
   algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for
   providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
   traffic and for the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport
   Control Protocol (RTCP).

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the Camellia [RFC3713] block
   cipher algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
   [RFC3711] for providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] traffic and for the control traffic for RTP,
   the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550].

1.1.  Camellia

   Camellia is a symmetric cipher with a Feistel structure.  Camellia
   was developed jointly by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in
   2000.  It was designed to withstand all known cryptanalytic attacks,
   and it has been scrutinized by worldwide cryptographic experts.
   Camellia is suitable for implementation in software and hardware,
   offering encryption speed in software and hardware implementations
   that is comparable to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   [FIPS.197.2001].

   Camellia supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key
   lengths, i.e., the same interface specifications as the AES.
   Therefore, it is easy to implement Camellia based algorithms by
   replacing the AES block of AES based algorithms with a Camellia
   block.

   Camellia already has been adopted by the IETF and other international
   standardization organizations; in particular, the IETF has published
   specifications for the use of Camellia with IPsec [RFC4312], TLS
   [RFC4132], S/MIME [RFC3657] and XML Security [RFC4051].  Camellia is
   one of the three ISO/IEC international standard [ISO/IEC 18033-3]
   128-bit block ciphers (Camellia, AES, and SEED).  Camellia was
   selected as a recommended cryptographic primitive by the EU NESSIE
   (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and Encryption)
   project [NESSIE] and was included in the list of cryptographic
   techniques for Japanese e-Government systems that was selected by the
   Japanese CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees)
   [CRYPTREC].

   Since optimized source code is provided under several open source
   licenses [open source license], Camellia is also adopted by several
   open source projects (OpenSSL, GnuTLS, FreeBSD, and Linux).  Camellia
   is also adopted by Mozilla and Camellia is ready for use with Firefox
   3.0 released in June 2008.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [RFC3713].

   The Camellia web site [Camellia web site] contains a wealth of
   information about Camellia, including detailed specification,
   security analysis, performance figures, reference implementation,
   optimized implementation, test vectors(TV), and intellectual property
   information.

1.2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" that
   appear in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Camellia Algorithm Suites for SRTP

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics
   and valuables, including mode, key size, weak keys, and block size.
   Camellia algorithm is specified as well as AES, those relations are
   following:

        - Camellia-CTR complies with [RFC3711]


3.  Default and mandatory-to-implement Transforms

   The default transforms also are mandatory-to-implement transforms in
   SRTP.  Of course, "mandatory-to-implement" does not imply "mandatory-
   to-use".  Table 1 summarizes the pre-defined transforms.  The default
   values below are valid for the pre-defined transforms.

4.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia (see
   [NESSIE], [CRYPTREC], and [LNCS]).

   The security considerations in RFC 5289 [RFC3711] apply to this
   document as well.


5.  IANA Considerations

   RFC 4568 [RFC4568] defines SRTP "crypto suites"; In order to allow
   SDP to signal the use of the algorithms defined in this document,
   IANA will register the following crypto suites into the subregistry
   for SRTP crypto suites under the SRTP transport of the SDP Security
   Descriptions:

         srtp-crypto-suite-ext = "CAMELLIA_CTR_128_HMAC_SHA1_80" /
                                 "CAMELLIA_CTR_128_HMAC_SHA1_32" /
                                 srtp-crypto-suite-ext

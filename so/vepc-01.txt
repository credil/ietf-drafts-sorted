Abstract

   This contribution addresses the service providers requirements to
   support Cloud services interworking with the existing MPLS-based L2
   and L3 VPN services. Maintenance of virtual separation of the
   traffic, data, and queries must be supported for the VPN customers
   that are conscious of end-to-end security features and functions that
   VPN technologies provide today.

1  Introduction

   Data center, WAN/MAN, and the end user are three of the components
   that make up the Cloud in the vision of Cloud Computing. However, the
   existing technologies often treat each component as black boxes,
   detached from each other. This fact limits the overall cohesiveness
   of an end-to-end service. For example, the network often views the
   data center as a black box, meaning the network has no control or
   visibility (from a standards point-of-view) into the data center. As
   a network provider, a Cloud-service product may be offered across
   multiple data centers globally, some of which may be owned by a
   network provider while others may be owned by a partner/vendor. In
   addition, multiple Cloud-Service products can be offered in the same
   data centers. A list of the problems that this situation is causing
   the network provider/operator, especially for the existing VPN
   customers, is presented below. These must be addressed immediately,
   in order for service providers to persuade the existing VPN customers
   to leverage the deployed Cloud-based services.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2 Cloud Customer End to End Separation


2.1. VPN Traffic Segregation Requirements

   The success of VPN services in the enterprise and the government
   world is largely due to its ability to virtually segregate the
   customer traffic at layer 2 and layer 3. The lower the layer that
   segregation can be maintained, the safer it is for the customers from
   security and privacy perspectives. Today, networks within a data
   center are administrated by separate entities than the networks which
   interconnect data centers to end users. 

   Prior to Cloud services age, all applications running on data
   center's servers and data stored in data center's storage devices are
   managed by data center owners. The network segregation within data
   center, usually in Layer 2 VLAN format, is mainly to control
   broadcast domain and optimize network performance. 

   With the introduction of cloud services, applications running on
   servers or virtual servers within data center can be owned and
   administrated by individual users or clients.  For clients who
   already have VPN from service providers to interconnect multiple

   sites, they need their cloud service to be integrated within the same
   VPN.

   Therefore, it is very crucial for service providers to extend their
   existing VPNs into data centers. Network service providers view the
   VPN extension into data center, allowing traffic segregation per VPN,
   an essential necessity to the success of Cloud-Services in the
   enterprises and government markets. Cloud-Applications (or the
   virtualization function) SHOULD have the ability to get access to VPN
   (including Layer 2/3 VPN) services, to segregate different Cloud-
   Services traffic trough the network.

2.2. Potential Solution

2.2.1. VPN Gateway Managed Connection Segregation

   One possible way to achieve this is to have each Cloud-Application
   setup connections with the VPN gateways, while the gateways attach
   each connection to corresponding VPN. This can be accomplished using
   a simple VRF from a provider edge router, each client can be assigned
   to one VRF. 

   If Provider Edge Router (for provider VPN) is not co-located with the
   data center gateway, then it is necessary for Data Center gateway to
   build tunnels to VPN provider edge router. 

   Or requiring each host running within the data center to have an
   IPSec VPN client, which can establish its own VPN tunnel to the
   provider edge router. 

2.2.2 Solution using Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) and Shortest Path
   Bridging (SPB)

   Ethernet and VLANS are the standard L2 connectivity model throughout
   the data center environment. As such the IEEE has been working on
   numerous projects to simplify and extend traditional Ethernet models
   for scale and flexibility. Additionally the IEEE has projects looking
   at new attachments models for Virtual Machines (VMs) to become more
   autonomic and secure for environments that include wholly owned and
   multi-tenant. The I-SID extensions that are defined in the SPB
   standard SHOULD also be used to connect a configured I-SID to an
   existing VRF on the provider edge router when SBPB is used for L2
   discovery in the data center.

   Although VLAN and PPPoE are different types of connections, the two
   methods described above are fundamentally the same. Consequently, it
   is possible to generalize the descriptions above to cover both the
   cases.

2.2.3 VPN Gateway Controlled Traffic Flow

   When virtual switch function is supported by servers which support
   VMs, L2/L3 VPN features can be added to the Virtual Switch on the
   server. One way to do that is to have the VPN gateway manage the
   traffic flow instead of other way around.  In that case, the VPN
   gateway has the VRF table and the destination server connection
   address.  Once the server receives the traffic, it determines intra-
   data center destination based on the application.  So the control
   sequence is VPN first, and then application.  The control sequence
   for the first two methods described above is application first, and
   then VPN.

2.2.4 Inter-VPN Interworking

   L2/L3 VPN based MPLS network can also be deployed in the data center
   to manage the intra-data center traffic flow.  The data center VPN
   structure can be set up in such a way that each external VPN can be
   mapped to a unique internal VPN.

2.3. Cloud Services Virtualization

2.3.1. Cloud Virtualization Requirements

   Today data center virtualization is totally handled by data center
   servers and hypervisors.  The entire process is invisible to the
   underlying networks.  The virtualization function including
   application server and virtual machine (VM) allocation and
   assignment, disk space allocation, traffic loading and balancing, QoS
   assignments, and so on.  There shall be a way that the network can
   influence some virtualization functions that are important to the
   concept and spirit of the VPN.  

   - The Private Cloud provisioning and management system SHALL have the
   ability to dedicate a specific block of disk space per services per
   VPN.

   - Each VPN SHALL have the exclusive access to the dedicated block of
   disk space.

   - Each VPN SHALL have the ability to indicate the mechanism used to
   prevent the unwanted data retrieval for the block of disk space after
   it is no longer used by the VPN, before it can be re-used by other
   parties.

   - Each VPN SHALL have the ability to request a dedicated VM with
   certainly CPU capability, amount of memory and disk space.

INTERNET DRAFT            draft-so-vepc-01.txt         February 13, 2011


   - The VPN SHALL have the ability to request dedicated L2/3 network
   resources within the data center such as bandwidth, priorities, and
   so on.

   - The VPN SHALL have the ability to hold the requested resources
   without sharing with any other parties.

2.4. Cloud Services Restoration 

   Today, data center restoration and diversity designs are not
   necessarily linked to the network restoration and diversity design.
   This results in over-redundant design, wasting money and resources,
   and may cause traffic oscillation and service and performance
   degradation.  This problem is particularly important to the VPN
   traffic, which is usually highly performance sensitive.  The VPN
   extension SHOULD be able to indicate how the restoration is handled
   across layers, so that a unified end-to-end design and optimization
   can be achieved.   

   Furthermore the restoration capability awareness needs to be
   scalable, meaning problems occur in one area of the Cloud SHALL NOT
   affect all other areas of the Cloud involved.  This way each
   component of the Cloud can scale independently without causing
   systemic failures and/or allowing a single failure to cascade across
   the Cloud.

2.5 Other Non-VPN Specific Areas

   There are a number of known technology gaps preventing the data
   centers, networks, and the end users from interworking together in
   providing optimized and seamless end-to-end services. Although those
   areas are beyond VPN, they impact the VPN-based cloud services
   significantly. Those areas are listed below, but they are beyond the
   scope of this draft.

2.5.1. Cloud Traffic Load-Balancing and Congestion Avoidance

   Todays Cloud traffic balancing and congestion avoidance is purely
   data center based. The network condition is not taken into
   consideration. The VPN extension SHOULD support the network condition
   to be used for the traffic balancing and congestion avoidance
   decision-making.

2.5.2. QoS Synchronization

   It is required that the virtualization functions QoS requirement
   SHOULD be synchronized with VPN service.

INTERNET DRAFT            draft-so-vepc-01.txt         February 13, 2011


2.5.3 Cross Layer Optimization

   The VPN resource requested by the server CAN be optimized by
   statistical multiplexing of the resource. For example, for each VPN
   resource, it is possible to configure committed BW for each QoS
   resources and peak BW for best effort traffic, and the peak BW
   resources CAN be shared by different VPN service.

2.5.4 Automation end to end Configuration

   The automatic end-to-end network configuration will reduce the
   operational cost and also the probability of occurrence of
   misconfiguration. The VPN Extension SHALL support the automatic end-
   to-end network configuration.

2.6. End-to-End Quality of Experience (ETE-QoE)

   Quality of experience (QoE) management refers to maintaining a set of
   application /service layer parameters within certain threshold with
   an objective to retain the user experience for a specific service.
   Very often when new underlying technologies and/or mechanisms are
   introduced for implementing the same services (voice, data, video,
   messaging, etc.), opportunities exist to improve the user
   experiences. Conversely the user experience may suffer unless the
   appropriate transport level parameters that significantly impact the
   QoE are monitored and managed.

2.7. OAM Considerations

   The VPN Extension solution MUST have sufficient OAM mechanisms in
   place to allow consistent end-to-end management of the solution in
   existing deployed networks. The solution SHOULD use existing
   protocols (802.3ag, Y.1731, BFD) wherever possible to help with
   interoperability of existing OAM deployments.

2.8. Work Item Considerations in IETF Clouds

   In VPN extension to private Clouds, various application level
   parameters, protocol level parameter, and service monitoring
   parameters may need to be defined, and the results of monitoring may
   need to be exchanged periodically. In private cloud environment,
   since the resources exist in one or co-operative administrative
   domain, it is easier to monitor and manage the application and
   transport level parameters for the underlying resources. In some
   cases, proactive mechanisms can be readily implemented before user
   experiences degrade to the level of annoyance. In public and hybrid
   (a smart combination of private and public) clouds it is required to
   derive a list of mutually agreed upon monitoring and management

   parameters. Active monitoring using virtual agents and resources is
   also possible. However, allocation of resources and placement of the
   virtual agent including the amount of traffic generated for QoE
   management, and the exchange of the desired information back and
   forth need to be achieved.

3  Security Considerations

   The VPN extension SHOULD support variety of security measures in
   securing tenancy of virtual resources such as resource locking,
   containment, authentication, access control, encryption, integrity
   measure, and etc. The VPN extension SHOULD allow the security to be
   configure end-to-end on a per VPN per-user bases. For example, the
   Virtual Systems MUST resource lock resources such as memory, but must
   also provide a cleaning function to insure confidentiality, before
   being reallocated. 

   VPN extension for private Clouds SHOULD specify an authentication
   mechanism based on an authentication algorithms (MD5, HMAC-SHA-1)for
   both header and payload. Encryption MAY also be use to provide
   confidentiality.

   Security boundaries MAY also be create to maintain domains of
   TRUSTED, UNTRUSTED, and Hybrid. Within each domain access control
   techniques MAY be uses to secure resource and administrative domains.

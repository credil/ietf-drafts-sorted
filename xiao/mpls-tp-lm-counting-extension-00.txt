Abstract

   Packet loss measurement for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
   PseudoWires, Label Switched Paths, and Sections, is an important
   Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) function of the
   MPLS-TP.  When this OAM function is performed, counting the
   transmitted and received packets at both the source MEP and the sink
   MEP needs to be activated at first.  This document specifies OAM
   packets and protocol mechanism to facilitate the counting activation
   and deactivation at the sink MEP, and leave out the unnecessary
   management configuration at the sink MEP when the MPLS-TP connection
   is bidirectional or there exists an out-of-band return path.

Internet-Draft    Extension to Packet Loss Measurement         July 2010


1.  Introduction

   As defined in MPLS-TP OAM requirements [RFC5860], "the MPLS-TP OAM
   toolset MUST provide a function to enable the quantification of
   packet loss ratio over a PW, LSP, or Section, this function MAY
   either be performed proactively or on-demand, this function SHOULD be
   performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs, and Sections and it SHOULD
   be possible to rely on user traffic to perform this functionality".

   To fulfill the above MPLS-TP OAM requirements with respect to packet
   loss measurement, the coherent general OAM procedures including
   configuration considerations, and specific function implementation
   including OAM packets format are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework] and [I-D.frost-mpls-tp-loss-delay]
   respectively.  From the two documents it can be inferred that when
   packet loss measurement is performed, counting the transmitted and
   received packets at both the source MEP and the sink MEP needs to be
   activated at first, and furthermore the counting should rely on user
   traffic packets with specific configured PHB.  Also note that in this
   context the source MEP specifies the MEP which will transmit Loss
   Measurement Query message and the sink MEP specifies the MEP which
   will reply Loss Measurement Response message.

   This document specifies OAM packets and protocol mechanism to
   facilitate the counting activation and deactivation at the sink MEP,
   and leave out the unnecessary management configuration at the sink
   MEP when the MPLS-TP connection is bidirectional or there exists an
   out-of-band return path.

2.  Counting Activation/Deactivation Packet Format

   Just like other MPLS-TP OAM packets, the counting activation/
   deactivation packets will flow over the Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) [RFC5586] of an MPLS-TP connection.  The counting activation/
   deactivation packets are used to perform signaling between the source
   MEP and the sink MEP of packet loss measurement.

   The format of a counting activation/deactivation packet is shown
   below.

3.  Counting Activation Operations

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework], before packet loss
   measurement is initiated, whether the operational mode is proactive
   monitoring or on-demand monitoring, the measurement parameters need
   to be provisioned at the source MEP.  The provisioned measurement
   parameters for proactive monitoring include measurement interval and
   PHB value which identifies the per-hop behavior of packets with loss
   information, and further include measurement times for on-demand
   monitoring.  Also note that after these packet loss measurement
   parameters are provisioned and this function is enabled at the source
   MEP, counting the transmitted and received packets with the
   provisioned PHB at the source MEP will be activated automatically.

3.1.  Transmitting a Counting Activation Request

   After initiating a packet loss measurement operation, whether the
   operational mode is proactive monitoring or on-demand monitoring, the
   source MEP (i.e. the initiator MEP) will at first transmit a Counting
   Activation Request to the sink MEP (i.e. the peer MEP).  This message
   is intended to trigger the sink MEP to start counting the transmitted
   and received packets with the specified PHB.

3.2.  Receiving a Counting Activation Request

   Upon the reception of a Counting Activation Request, the sink MEP
   must inspect this message at first, and if no unexpected field or
   value is found then the sink MEP should start counting the
   transmitted and received packets with the received PHB, otherwise
   specific error should be returned at the sink MEP.

Internet-Draft    Extension to Packet Loss Measurement         July 2010


3.3.  Transmitting a Counting Activation Reply

   When a Counting Activation Request is received, the sink MEP must
   transmit a Counting Activation Reply to the source MEP.  The Control
   Code in Counting Activation Reply Message should be set to 0x0 to
   reflect the successful operation (i.e. activate counting
   successfully) at the sink MEP, or on the contrary set to 0x1 to
   reflect the failed operation (i.e. activate counting unsuccessfully)
   at the sink MEP.  The received PHB value should be copied to the same
   PHB field in the Counting Activation Reply message.

3.4.  Receiving a Counting Activation Reply

   Upon the reception of a Counting Activation Reply, the source MEP
   must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field or value
   is found and the received Control Code indicates successful operation
   at the sink MEP, then the source MEP should start transmitting Loss
   Measurement Query to commence the procedures defined in
   [I-D.frost-mpls-tp-loss-delay], otherwise specific error should be
   returned at the source MEP.  If there is no any Counting Activation
   Reply received after a while (such as 1 second), then specific error
   should be returned at the source MEP.


4.  Counting Deactivation Operations

   As indicated above, before packet loss measurement is initiated, the
   measurement parameters need to be provisioned at the source MEP, and
   after this function is enabled, counting the transmitted and received
   packets with the provisioned PHB at the source MEP will be activated
   automatically.  Similarly with that after the packet loss measurement
   function is disabled at the source MEP, counting the transmitted and
   received packets with the provisioned PHB at the source MEP will be
   deactivated automatically.

4.1.  Transmitting a Counting Deactivation Request

   After stopping a packet loss measurement operation, the source MEP
   (i.e. the initiator MEP) will stop transmitting Loss Measurement
   Query, and then transmit a Counting Deactivation Request to the sink
   MEP (i.e. the peer MEP).  This message is intended to trigger the
   sink MEP to stop counting the transmitted and received packets with
   the specified PHB.

4.2.  Receiving a Counting Deactivation Request

   Upon the reception of a Counting Deactivation Request, the sink MEP
   must inspect this message at first, and if no unexpected field or

   value is found then the sink MEP should stop counting the transmitted
   and received packets with the received PHB, otherwise specific error
   should be returned at the sink MEP.

4.3.  Transmitting a Counting Deactivation Reply

   When a Counting Deactivation Request is received, the sink MEP must
   transmit a Counting Deactivation Reply to the source MEP.  The
   Control Code in Counting Deactivation Reply Message should be set to
   0x0 to reflect the successful operation (i.e. deactivate counting
   successfully) at the sink MEP, or on the contrary set to 0x1 to
   reflect the failed operation (i.e. deactivate counting
   unsuccessfully) at the sink MEP.  The received PHB value should be
   copied to the same PHB field in the Counting Deactivation Reply
   message.

4.4.  Receiving a Counting Deactivation Reply

   Upon the reception of a Counting Deactivation Reply, the source MEP
   must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field or value
   is found and the received Control Code indicates successful operation
   at the sink MEP, then there is no action at the source MEP, otherwise
   specific error should be returned at the source MEP.  If there is no
   any Counting Deactivation Reply received after a while (such as 1
   second), then specific error should be returned at the source MEP.


5.  Considerations for Control Plane

   When the packet loss measurement is employed in operational mode of
   proactive monitoring, the configured measurement parameters can be
   transferred from the source MEP to the sink MEP through the control
   plane by extending RSVP-TE [RFC3209], as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-mpls-tp-oam-ext].  But in that draft, the
   sink MEP of one LM session is configured as a source MEP of another
   LM session, with all the same parameters such as measurement interval
   and PHB value.  Actually there is another option which will
   distinguish the sink MEP function from the source MEP function when
   configuring proactive packet loss measurement at an MEP, which means
   that at the sink MEP only the function of counting the transmitted
   and received packets with specified PHB will be activated, in other
   words the sink MEP won't act as a source MEP of another LM session
   and won't transmit LM message initiatively.  The option dictated
   above help to increase operation flexibility when performing
   proactive packet loss measurement, and decrease the bandwidth taken
   up by OAM messages due to that in this case only one LM session is
   needed.  If this option is adopted when configuring parameters of
   proactive packet loss measurement by control plane, then the "MPLS

   OAM PM Loss TLV" defined in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-mpls-tp-oam-ext]
   can be simplified and the MEP which receives this TLV can trigger
   only the sink MEP function.

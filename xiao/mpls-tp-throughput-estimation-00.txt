Abstract

   An important Operation, Administration and Maintenance requirement of
   the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to estimate the
   throughput (i.e. bandwidth) for an MPLS-TP connection which could be
   an MPLS-TP PW, LSP or Section.  This document specifies OAM packets
   (include test packets) and protocol mechanisms to facilitate the
   efficient and precise measurement of throughput.

1.  Introduction

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements], the MPLS-TP OAM
   toolset MUST provide a function to enable conducting diagnostic tests
   on a PW, LSP or Section, this function SHOULD be performed on-demand
   and one example of such diagnostic test consists in estimating the
   bandwidth of e.g., an LSP.

   To make this requirement more clear and provide more details, this
   sub-function of diagnostic tests is specified as "throughput
   estimation" in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework], throughput
   estimation is an on-demand out-of-service function, that allows
   verifying the bandwidth/throughput of an MPLS-TP transport path (LSP
   or PW) before it is put in-service.  Throughput estimation is
   performed between MEPs and can be performed in one-way or two-way
   mode.

   This document specifies the OAM packet format (include test packet
   format) and the procedures for both one-way and two-way throughput
   estimation/measurement.

2.  Overview

   In [RFC1242], the throughput is specified as a performance metric for
   network interconnection device, and it's defined by "the maximum rate
   at which none of the offered frames are dropped by the device".  In
   MPLS-TP context the concept of throughput is not just for a
   particular device, but extended to apply to an MPLS-TP connection
   which could be a PW, LSP or Section.

   In [RFC2544], corresponding to [RFC1242], the throughput measurement
   procedures are specified as "send a specific number of frames at a
   specific rate through the DUT and then count the frames that are
   transmitted by the DUT.  If the count of offered frames is equal to
   the count of received frames, the fewer frames are received than were
   transmitted, the rate of the offered stream is reduced and the test
   is rerun.  The throughput is the fastest rate at which the count of
   test frames transmitted by the DUT is equal to the number of test
   frames sent to it by the test equipment".  But in current practical
   throughput measurement scenario, usually the throughput is measured
   by test equipment using the more efficient binary search algorithm.

   It should also be noted that for different test packet size, or test
   packet pattern, or test packet PHB, or expected measurement
   resolution, or even sending duration of test traffic, different
   result of throughput measurement may be obtained, so all these
   parameters need to be configurable for throughput measurement.

2.1.  Two-way Throughput Measurement

   For a bidirectional MPLS-TP connection, two-way throughput
   measurement needs to be supported.  Two-way throughput should include
   the throughput for the forward direction of the connection and the
   throughput for the reverse direction of the connection.  In order to
   simplify the implementation and facilitate the results collection,
   all computational overhead and procedures control will be taken by
   the initiator MEP of throughput measurement, and the peer MEP will
   act just as a responder.  Also note that both the initiator MEP and

Internet-Draft        Thput Estimation for MPLS-TP            April 2010


   the peer MEP need to send test traffic for two-way throughput
   measurement.

2.2.  One-way Throughput Measurement

   For a bidirectional MPLS-TP connection, one-way throughput
   measurement also needs to be supported.  One-way throughput only
   indicates the throughput for the forward direction of the connection.
   Similar to two-way throughput measurement, the initiator MEP controls
   the whole process of throughput measurement and the peer MEP will act
   just as a responder.  Also note that only the initiator MEP needs to
   send test traffic for one-way throughput measurement.

2.3.  Unidirectional Connections

   For a unidirectional MPLS-TP connection without return path, such as
   a unidirectional LSP, only one-way throughput measurement needs to be
   supported.  In this case, the procedures of throughput measurement
   are some different with that for bidirectional connection.  The
   procedures are not as automatic as that for bidirectional connection,
   and manual provision of test parameters is needed for every run of
   sending test traffic.  Also the peer MEP instead of the initiator MEP
   will act as calculator for packet loss after every run.


3.  Packet Format

   For throughput measurement the OAM packets can be divided into
   indication packets and test packets, and both of them flow over the
   Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) [RFC5586] of an MPLS-TP
   connection.  The indication packets perform signaling between the
   initiator MEP and the peer MEP of throughput measurement, while the
   test packets compose the test traffic which is sent by the initiator
   MEP (for one-way measurement) or both the initiator MEP and the peer
   MEP (for two-way measurement).

   tests which is specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework].


4.  Throughput Measurement Procedures

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework], before throughput
   measurement is initiated, the diagnosed MEG should be put into a Lock
   status, and an MEG can be put into a Lock status either via NMS
   action or using the Lock Instruct OAM tool.  In addition, the test
   parameters for sending test traffic need to be provisioned before
   initiating a throughput measurement at the initiator MEP, and they
   include initial sending rate, sending duration, test packet size,
   test packet Pattern and test packet PHB.  Also note that the expected
   measurement resolution needs to be specified before throughput
   measurement procedures start.

4.1.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Start Request

   After initiating a throughput measurement operation, the initiator
   MEP will at first transmit a throughput measurement Start Request to
   the peer MEP.  Also note that for every rerun of sending test
   traffic, the initiator MEP must transmit this message as beginning.

   For one-way throughput measurement, this message is intended to
   inform the peer MEP about the start of test traffic sending at the
   initiator MEP and trigger the peer MEP to start test packets
   counting.  For two-way throughput measurement, except for the same
   intention as one-way throughput measurement, this message is also
   intended to convey necessary test parameters to the peer MEP and
   trigger the test traffic sending at the peer MEP, and for rerun only
   Run Count and Sending Rate in the message need to be changed while
   other parameters retain initial values.  Furthermore, for both one-
   way and two-way measurement, the initiator MEP should start test
   packet counting as soon as it transmit this message.

   Specifically if the connection is unidirectional, then the Control
   Code in the message must not be set to 0x0 (in-band reply requested),
   moreover if no return path exists the Control Code in the message
   must be set to 0x2 (no reply requested).

4.2.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Start Request

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Start Request, the
   peer MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field
   or value is found then the peer MEP should start test packet
   counting.  In addition, if the received One-way/Two-way flag
   indicates that this is a two-way throughput measurement, then the
   peer MEP also need to prepare for sending test traffic using the

Internet-Draft        Thput Estimation for MPLS-TP            April 2010


   received test parameters.

   Specifically if the received One-way/Two-way flag indicates that this
   is a one-way throughput measurement, and the received Control Code is
   set to 0x2 (no reply requested) which means the connection is
   unidirectional without return path, then the peer MEP won't transmit
   Start Reply.

4.3.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Start Reply

   When the Control Code in a received Start Request is set to 0x0 (in-
   band reply requested) or 0x1 (out-of-band reply requested), the peer
   MEP must transmit a throughput measurement Start Reply to the
   initiator MEP.  The Control Code in Start Reply Message should be set
   to 0x0 to reflect the successful operation at the peer MEP, or on the
   contrary set to 0x1 to reflect the failed operation at the peer MEP.
   Except the Request/Reply flag and Control Code field, other fields of
   Start Reply Message will be copied from the received Start Request
   Message.

4.4.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Start Reply

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Start Reply, the
   initiator MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected
   field or value is found, and the received Control Code indicates
   successful operation at the peer MEP, then the initiator MEP should
   start sending test traffic.

4.5.  Sending and Receiving Test Traffic

   For a bidirectional MPLS-TP connection or a unidirectional MPLS-TP
   connection with return path, the initiator MEP must send test traffic
   after receiving the Start Reply in which Control Code indicates
   success.  For a unidirectional MPLS-TP connection without return
   path, the initiator MEP must send test traffic after transmitting the
   Start Request in which Control code is set to 0x2 (no reply
   requested).

   For one-way throughput measurement, only the initiator MEP must send
   test traffic.  For two-way throughput measurement, both the initiator
   MEP and the peer MEP must send test traffic, and the peer MEP must
   send test traffic after transmitting the Start Reply in which Control
   Code is set to 0x0 (success).

   For two-way throughput measurement it's possible that a pair of MEPs
   sends test traffic asynchronously, and in this case the peer MEP will
   send test traffic some earlier than the initiator MEP, but the
   asynchronism has no effect on the measurement result.

Internet-Draft        Thput Estimation for MPLS-TP            April 2010


   When the initiator MEP sends test traffic the test parameters are all
   derived from the provisioned test parameters for the first run, and
   for rerun only the sending rate is changed and derived from the local
   calculation.  When the peer MEP sends test traffic the test
   parameters are all derived from the received Start Request Message
   and no provision is needed at the peer MEP.

4.6.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Stop Request

   For every run, after the initiator MEP finished sending test traffic,
   it will transmit a throughput measurement Stop Request to the peer
   MEP.  This message is intended to inform the peer MEP about the stop
   of test traffic sending at the initiator MEP, and trigger the peer
   MEP to stop test packet counting and feed back the counters.

   Specifically if the connection is unidirectional, then the Control
   Code in the message must not be set to 0x0 (in-band reply requested),
   moreover if no return path exists the Control Code in the message
   must be set to 0x2 (no reply requested).

4.7.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Stop Request

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Stop Request, the peer
   MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field or
   value is found then the peer MEP should stop test packet counting.

   Specifically if the received One-way/Two-way flag indicates that this
   is a one-way throughput measurement, and the received Control Code is
   set to 0x2 (no reply requested) which means the connection is
   unidirectional without return path, then the peer MEP won't transmit
   Stop Reply and it will use the received Tx Counter to calculate test
   packet loss directly.

4.8.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Stop Reply

   When the Control Code in a received Stop Request is set to 0x0 (in-
   band reply requested) or 0x1 (out-of-band reply requested), the peer
   MEP must transmit a throughput measurement Stop Reply to the
   initiator MEP.  The Control Code in Stop Reply Message should be set
   to 0x0 to reflect the successful operation at the peer MEP, or on the
   contrary set to 0x1 to reflect the failed operation at the peer MEP.
   The Tx Counter and Rx Counter are set to the test packet counting
   values at the peer MEP.

4.9.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Stop Reply

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Stop Reply, the
   initiator MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected

   field or value is found, and the received Control Code indicates
   successful operation at the peer MEP, then the initiator MEP should
   start calculating the test packet loss.  Suppose the Tx Counter and
   Rx Counter for the initiator MEP are TxP1 and RxP1, and for the peer
   MEP are TxP2 and RxP2.

   For two-way throughput measurement, the calculation formulas are as
   follow:

   Packet Loss (forward) = TxP1 - RxP2

   Packet Loss (reverse) = TxP2 - RxP1

   For one-way throughput measurement, the calculation formula is as
   follow:

   Packet Loss (one-way) = TxP1 - RxP2

4.10.  Consequent Actions and Searching Algorithm

   Procedures for one run of test traffic sending and test packet loss
   calculation have been described above in details, but usually
   iterative reruns of the procedures are needed for a throughput
   measurement.  Whether the rerun is needed or not is based on the
   calculated results of test packet loss and the expected measurement
   resolution.  For one-way throughput measurement, if calculated Packet
   Loss (one-way) is equal to zero and the expected measurement
   resolution is met, then rerun is not needed and the current sending
   rate is the measured one-way throughput, otherwise the one-way
   throughput measurement proceeds.  For two-way throughput measurement,
   if calculated Packet Loss (forward) and Packet Loss (reverse) are
   both equal to zero and the expected measurement resolution for both
   forward and reverse directions is met, then rerun is not needed and
   the current sending rate for forward/reverse direction is the
   measured forward/reverse throughput, otherwise the two-way throughput
   measurement proceeds, and in this case the sending rates for rerun
   should be calculated for forward direction and reverse direction
   respectively.

   The simple and efficient binary search algorithm is RECOMMENDED to
   calculate the sending rate for the next run, which is the only
   changed test parameter compared with this run.  How the binary search
   works, if packet loss is found for this run, it searches downwards
   for a lower rate which is halfway rate between the rate of this run
   and the known highest rate at which no packet loss is found; if no
   packet loss is found but the expected measurement resolution is not
   met for this run, it searches upwards for a higher rate which is
   halfway rate between the rate of this run and the known lowest rate



Xiao, et al.            Expires October 14, 2010               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        Thput Estimation for MPLS-TP            April 2010


   at which packet loss is found; the measurement searches among higher
   and lower rates on the analogy of this, until it finds the rate at
   which no test packet is lost and expected measurement resolution is
   met, and this rate is the measured throughput.  How to judge whether
   the expected measurement resolution is met or not, if the rate
   difference between the two consecutive runs (i.e. this run and the
   previous run), expressed as a percentage, is smaller than or equal to
   the specified measurement resolution, it's known as that the expected
   measurement resolution is met, otherwise it's not met.

   For example, suppose to measure the throughput of a connection whose
   actual throughput is 70Mbps, the provisioned initial sending rate is
   100Mbps and the specified measurement resolution is 0.1.  Note that
   the initial sending rate should be higher than the actual throughput,
   otherwise the binary search is not applicable, and so it's often set
   to the maximum theoretical throughput of the measured connection.
   For the first run, packet loss is found, so for the second run, the
   sending rate will be calculated as (100+0)/2 = 50Mbps, no packet loss
   is found, then the resolution will be calculated as (100-50)/50 = 1,
   which is bigger than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is not
   met, so for the third run, the sending rate will be calculated as
   (100+50)/2 = 75Mbps, packet loss is found, so for the fourth run, the
   sending rate will be calculated as (50+75)/2 = 62.5Mbps, no packet
   loss is found, then the resolution will be calculated as (75-62.5)/
   62.5 = 0.2, which is bigger than 0.1, the expected measurement
   resolution is not met, so for the fifth run, the sending rate will be
   calculated as (75+62.5)/2 = 68.75Mbps, no packet loss is found, then
   the resolution will be calculated as (68.75-62.5)/68.75 = 0.09, which
   is smaller than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is met, so
   the measurement finished and the rate 68.75Mbps is the measured
   throughput.

   Other algorithms than the binary search algorithm could also be used
   to search throughput in practice, e.g. increasing or decreasing the
   sending rate in a fixed step from a specified initial sending rate
   until the test packet loss appears or disappears.


5.  Throughput Measurement Time

   The throughput measurement time is about the product of sending
   duration for one run and number of all run times.  The sending
   duration for one run is provisioned before the throughput measurement
   starts, and the number of all run times is related to several
   factors, which include the provisioned initial sending rate, the
   applied searching algorithm and the specified expected measurement
   resolution.  It's obvious that longer sending duration is
   provisioned, then longer throughput measurement time is needed, but



Xiao, et al.            Expires October 14, 2010               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        Thput Estimation for MPLS-TP            April 2010


   it should be noted that longer sending duration can result in more
   precise measured throughput, so there should be a balance between
   them.  Also obviously the expectations for shorter throughput
   measurement time and higher throughput measurement resolution are
   mutually exclusive, so the balance between them is needed too.

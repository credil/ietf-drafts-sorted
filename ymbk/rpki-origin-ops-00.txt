Internet-Draft   RPKI-Based Origin Validation Operations   November 2010


1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based origin validation relies on widespread propagation of the
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch].  How
   the RPKI is distributed and maintained globally is a serious concern
   from many aspects.

   The global RPKI has yet to be deployed, only a testbed exists, and
   some beta testing is being done by the IANA and some RIRs.  It is
   expected to be deployed incrementally over a number of years.  It is
   thought that origin validation based on the RPKI will deploy over the
   next year to five years.

   Origin validation only need be done by an AS's border routers and is
   designed so that it can be used to protect announcements which are
   originated by large providers, upstreams and downstreams, and by
   small stub/entetprise/edge routers.

   Origin validation has been designed to be deployed on current routers
   without hardware upgrade.  It should be used by everyone from large
   backbones to small stub/entetprise/edge routers.

   RPKI-based origin validation has been designed so that, with prudent
   local routing policies, there is no liability that normal Internet
   routing is threatened by unprudent deployment of the global RPKI, see
   Section 5.


2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], the RPKI,
   see [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch], the RPKI Repository Structure, see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct], ROAs, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format],
   the RPKI to Router Protocol, see [I-D.ymbk-rpki-rtr-protocol], and
   RPKI-based Prefix Validation, see [I-D.pmohapat-sidr-pfx-validate].


3.  RPKI Distribution and Maintenance

   The RPKI is a distributed database containing certificates, CRLs,
   manifests, ROAs, and Ghostbuster Records as described in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct].  Policies and considerations for RPKI
   object generation and maintenance are discussed elsewhere.

   A local valid cache containing all RPKI data may be gathered from the
   global distributed database using the rsync protocol and a validation
   tool such as rcynic.

   Validated caches may also be created and maintained from other
   validated caches.  An operator should take maximum advantage of this
   feature to minimize load on the global distributed RPKI database.

   As RPKI-based origin validation relies on the availability of RPKI
   data, operators will likely want border routers to have one or more
   nearby caches.

   For redundancy, a router may peer with more than one cache at the
   same time.  Peering with two or more, one local and others remote, is
   recommended.

   If an operator or site trusts upstreams to carry their traffic, they
   might as well trust the RPKI data those upstreams cache and feed off
   of those caches.  Note that this places an obligation on those
   upstreams to maintain fresh and reliable caches.

   A transit provider or a network with peers will want to validate
   origins in announcements made by downstreams and peers.  They still
   may choose to trust the caches provided by their upstreams.


4.  Within a Network

   Origin validation need only be done by edge routers in a network,
   those which border other networks/ASs.

   A validating router will use the result of origin validation to
   influence local policy within its network, see Section 5.  In
   deployment this policy should fit into the AS's existing policy,
   preferences, etc.  This allows a network to incrementally deploy
   validation capable border routers.

   eBGP speakers which face more critical peers or up/downstreams would
   be candidates for the earliest deployment.  Validating more critical
   received announcements should be considered in partial deployment.


5.  Routing Policy

   Origin validation based on the RPKI merely marks a received
   announcement as having an origin which is Validated, Unknown, or
   Invalid.  How this is used in routing is up to the router operator's
   local policy.  See [I-D.pmohapat-sidr-pfx-validate].

   Reasonable application of local policy should be designed eliminate
   the threat of unroutability of prefixes due to ill-advised or
   incorrect certification policies.

   As origin validation will be rolled out over years coverage will be
   spotty for a long time.  Hence a normal operator's policy should not
   be overly strict, perhaps preferring valid announcements and giving
   very low preference, but still using, invalid announcements.

   Some may choose to use the large Local-Preference hammer.  Others
   might choose to let AS-Path rule and set their internal metric, which
   comes after AS-Path in the BGP decision process.

   Certainly, routing on unknown validity state will be prevalent for a
   long time.

   Until the community feels comfortable relying on RPKI data, routing
   on invalid origin validity, though at a low preference, may be
   prevalent for a long time.

   Announcements with valid origins SHOULD be preferred over those with
   unknown or invalid origins.

   Announcements with unvalidatable origins SHOULD be preferred over
   those with invalid origins.

   Announcements with invalid origins MAY be used, but SHOULD be less
   preferred than those with valid or unknown.


6.  Notes

   Like the DNS, the global RPKI presents only a loosely consistent
   view, depending on timing, updating, fetching, etc.  Thus, one cache
   or router may have different data about a particular prefix than
   another cache or router.  There is no 'fix' for this, it is the
   nature of distributed data with distributed caches.

   There is some uncertainty about the origin AS of aggregates and what,
   if any, ROA can be used.  The long range solution to this is the
   deprecation of AS-SETs, see [I-D.wkumari-deprecate-as-sets].


7.  Security Considerations

   As the BGP origin is not signed, origin validation is open to
   malicious spoofing.  It is only designed to deal with inadvertent
   mis-advertisement.

   Origin validation does nothing about AS-Path validation and therefore
   is open to monkey in the middle path attacks.

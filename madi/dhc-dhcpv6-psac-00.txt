   Extended DHCPv6 for Piggybacking Security Association Configuration
                     draft-madi-dhc-dhcpv6-psac-00

Abstract

   IPSec [RFC2401]is pervasive in many scenarios to build the channel of
   security mechanism to protect the communication between the host and
   the local servers, such as DNS recursive name server [RFC1304].  In
   the public wireless access environment, an extra trust relationship
   configuration between the roaming host and the local server, manually
   or by IKE [RFC2409], is indispensible.

   DHCP is typically the first protocol executed by a mobile host when
   it enters a new network, so this document present an extension to
   DHCPv6 to piggyback the parameters needed for IPSec, avoiding the
   delay invited by manual configuration of security association or IKE
   interaction for IPSec.

1.  Introduction

   There are an increasing number of mobile hosts who, roaming across
   different access domains, want to resort to the shared key based
   method to gain secrecy and integrity of the data exchange with the
   local server of the access network, the communication between the DNS
   stub resolver and the local DNS recursive name sever as an example.
   IPSec, for instance, is pervasive in many scenarios to build the
   channel of security mechanism.  And IPSec architecture has a security
   policy database that specifies which traffic is protected and how,
   which could be established with a manual configuration of security
   associations or with IKE [RFC5996].  As for the mobile host, its
   security association with the local server is usually established by
   IKE, which leads to an extra interaction delay.  Even the delay MAY
   not be taken into consideration, IKE is not necessarily not be
   supported everywhere.

   DHCP allows a computer to be configured automatically, eliminating
   the need for intervention by a network administrator.  For IPv4,
   DHCPv4 is typically the first protocol executed by a mobile host when
   it enters a new network.  Even in the era of IPv6, according to the
   point of view of Ralph, DHCP service is typically provided by a
   centralized service composed of fewer managed components [21], so
   DHCP server misconfiguration is less likely than delivery of
   misconfigured Route Advertisements.  Since DHCP also takes the
   responsibility in configuring the IP address of the local server, the
   security association information between the host and the specific
   local server, such as SIP server and DNS recursive name server, could
   be piggybacked via DHCP messages, avoiding the delay invited by
   manual configuration of security association or IKE interaction for
   IPSec.

   This document describes the extension to DHCP to integrate security
   association construction course into the DHCP interaction to build
   the trust relationship between the roaming host and the specific
   local server of the access network.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   DHCPv6 terminology is defined in [RFC3315].  Terminology specific to
   the extension of DHCPv6 can be found below:

   Throughout this document, "DHCP" refers to DHCP for IPv6.  DHCP
   terminology is defined in [RFC3315] and IPSec terminology is defined

   in [RFC2401].  Terminology specific to the extension of DHCP can be
   found below:

   SA - SA is short for Security Association and defined in IPSec
   specification [RFC2401].

   SPI - SPI is short for Security Parameter Index and defined in IPSec
   specification [RFC2401].

   target server - A local server of the access network, DNS recursive
   name server for instance, which is to be configured the security
   association with a specific host, by DHCP.  The target server works
   as a DHCP client listening for DHCP messages on UDP port 546.

   requestor - A host that wants to establish security association with
   a specific local server.  The requestor works as a DHCP client
   requesting the configuration parameters for security association.

   SA binding - SA binding is employed by DHCP server to manage the SA
   information which is indexed by the tuple [requestor's DUID, target
   server's DUID, SPI].

3.  Requirements and Considerations

   Although DHCP is being challenged by the SLAAC [RFC4862], yet this
   document is intended to take the position that DHCP is indispensible
   and necessary to the network administrative need.

   DHCP server and the target server are usually deployed within one
   same organization and public key schemes are not necessary, trust
   relationship based on preshared secret could be established between
   them by administrator's manual configuration to gain secrecy and
   integrity.  Accordingly, the extension in this document takes the
   position that DHCP service is indispensible and there is secured
   channel between DHCP server and the target server.

   To realize the very function of the extended DHCP, the host in
   question MUST have the ability to generate asymmetric key pair, the
   public key of which is used to encrypt the symmetric key to be shared
   with the target server.

   The extension of DHCPv6 SHOULD go with stateful service DHCPv6
   provides.

4.  Design Overview

   The focus of this document is to extend DHCP to piggyback SA
   information for the entities that want to employ IPSec, providing a

   quick configuration for security parameters.  It is especially
   appropriate for processes and devices that already interpret DHCP
   messages.

   With the extended DHCP, the host especially the roaming host is able
   to build trust relationship with the target server, the service from
   which is desired to be provided in a security channel.  Accordingly,
   the host called requestor in this document is on the initiative in
   the course of the SA establishment in SOLICIT message.  The DHCP
   server configured to take the responsibility responds.  The requestor
   SHOULD also present its public key to DHCP server for encrypting the
   symmetric key as an element of SA, and the DHCP server MUST provide
   the symmetric key in cipher text together with other parameters of
   the very SA.

   If selected by REQUEST message, the DHCP server will determine which
   target server will be configured with SA parameters according to the
   SA establishment request indicated by the requestor in a new defined
   option.  Then the DHCP server sends message to convey the SA to the
   selected target server and waiting REPLY message to make sure whether
   the SA parameters have been configured successfully or not.  To
   guarantee the confidentiality of the symmetric key, the access key
   SHOULD be encrypted by pre-shared key.

   Once the DHCP server gets the confirmation of SA configuration from
   the intended target server, it responds to requestor in REPLY message
   that includes SA parameter shared between the requestor and the
   target server whose service is wanted to be secured by the requestor.

   If needed, the DHCP serve MAY choose to update a current SA by
   sending RECONFIG-INIT message to the requestor.

5.  Extended DHCPv6 Operation

5.1.  Message and Option Definitions

5.1.1.  Messages

   Extended DHCP for Security Association Configuration specified in
   this document uses the Client/Server message formats described in
   [RFC3315], Section 6.  Two new message codes are defined:

   SACONFIGURATION (TDB by IANA)) - A DHCP server sends a
   SACONFIGURATION message to a target server to configure the SA
   parameters that are indicated in an option called OPTION_SA.

   SACONFIGURATION-REPLY (TDB by IANA) - A target server sends a
   REGISTRATION-REPLY message to a DHCP server the SA from which has

   Some status codes defined in [RFC5007] are redefined in the messages
   newly defined in this document, together with the new status codes,
   they are defined:

   NotConfigured (9) - The status code is originally defined in
   [RFC5007] and redefined with the massage defined in this document.
   The intended SACONFIGURATION-receiver is not configured to provide
   secured service based on IPSec.

   NotAllowed (10) - The status code is originally defined in [RFC5007]
   and redefined with the massage defined in this document.  The sender
   of SACONFIGURATION is not the authorized DHCP server to configure SA
   for IPSec.  The authentication of the DHCP server MAY be based on
   Authentication of DHCP Messages specified in Section 2.3.1 of
   [RFC3315].

   InappropriateAddress (TBD) - The requestor's IP address in the

   Requestor's Parameters Option is not a authorised one for the
   requestor or the target server's IP addressis in the SA Option is not
   one of the valid IP address of the target server.

   UnsupportedAlgorithm (TBD) - The algorithm specified in the
   Requestor's Parameters Option is not supported by the target server
   whose service is wanted to be secured.

   MalformedSACONFIGURATION (TBD) - The SACONFIGURATION is not valid;
   for example, the required symmetric key field is missing from the SA
   Option.  This status code is used only in SACONFIGURATION-REPLY
   message.

   FailedSACONFIGURATION (TBD) - The SACONFIGURATION interaction between
   the DHCP server and the target server is failed for some reasons.
   This status code is used only in REPLY message from DHCP server to
   the requestor.

5.1.4.  Transmission and Retransmission Parameters

     This section presents a table of values used to describe the
     message transmission behavior for IP address registration.
     Parameter         Default        Description
     ------------      ---------      -----------------------------------
     SAC_TIMEOUT       1 sec          Initial SACONFIGURATION timeout
     SAC_MAX_RT        10 secs        Max SACONFIGURATION timeout value
     SAC_MAX_RC        5              Max SACONFIGURATION retry attempts

5.2.  Message Validation

   The Message Validation specified in this document follow the basic
   message validation principles in [RFC3315], Section 15.  Requestors,
   target servers and DHCP servers SHOULD discard any messages that
   contain options that are not allowed to appear in the received
   message.

5.2.1.  SOLICIT

   Extended DHCP for Security Association Configuration with the Local
   Server in the Access Network mandates the confidentiality of the
   shared symmetric key.  The requestor MUST include Client Public key
   Option for encrypting the shared symmetric key.  DHCP Servers MUST
   discard any received SOLICIT messages that meet any of the following
   conditions:

   o the message does not include an OPTION_SERVERID option.

5.2.2.  SACONFIGURATION

   The target server MUST discard any received SACONFIGURATION messages
   that meet any of the following conditions:

   o the message does not include an OPTION_SERVERID option.

   o the message includes an OPTION_CLIENTID option but the contents of
   the OPTION CLIENTID option does not match the target server's
   identifier.

   o the message does not include a SA Option.

   DHCP servers, relay agents and the non-requestor DHCP clients MUST
   discard any received SACONFIGURATION messages.

5.2.3.  SACONFIGURATION-REPLY

   The target server MUST discard any received SACONFIGURATION-REPLY
   messages that meet any of the following conditions:

   o the message does not include an OPTION_CLIENTID option.

   o the message includes an OPTION_SERVERID option but the contents of
   the OPTION_SERVERID option does not match the server's identifier.

   o the message does not include a SA Option.

   o the "transaction-id" field in the message does not match the value
   used in the original message.

   Target servers (on the DHCP server port, 546 [RFC3315]), relay agents
   and DHCP clients MUST discard any received SACONFIGURATION-REPLY
   messages.

5.3.  DHCP Server Solicitation

   This section describes how the SA configuration with the target
   server in the access network will affect DHCP Server Solicitation
   specified in [RFC3315], Section 17.

   Once a host especially a mobile one intends to establish a SA with a
   local server in the access network to secure one certain service such
   as DNS recursive resolution service, it will include a SA Request
   Option together with the Client Public Key Option in its SOLICIT
   message.

   Once informed by SA Request Option included in the SOLICIT message,

Internet-Draft        draft-madi-dhc-dhcpv6-psac-00         October 2010


   the DHCP server will decide whether to provide the service for SA
   establishment according to its policies configured by the
   administrator of the access network.  If a DHCP server takes the
   responsibility in managing SA establishment for the requestor and the
   target server, it responds, via the ADVERTISE message, to the
   requestor it is able to find a proper IP address for IPSec as the
   requestor's agent.

   On receiving the ADVERTISE messages from several DHCP servers, the
   requestor selects one according to its local policies and then
   multicast the REQUEST message including the SA Request Option.  Once
   the selected DHCP server gets the REQUEST message, it decides which
   IP address will be involved in the intended SA establishment
   according to the requested-service-code of the Requestor's Parameters
   Option in the SA Request Option.

   Then DHCP server initiates SACONFIGURATION exchange with the target
   server.  Once the SACONFIGURATION has been confirmed from the
   intended target server, DHCP server sends Reply message to the
   requestor.

   The DHCP server use the SA binding to manage the SA parameters shared
   between the requestor and the target server.  The SA binding is
   indexed by the tuple [requestor's DUID, target server's DUID, SPI].

   The SACONFIGURATION mechanism is not compatible with Rapid-commit
   mode specified in [RFC3315], Section 17.1.1.

5.4.  SACONFIGURATION Behavior of DHCP Server

   Once receiving a REQUEST message with SA Request Option, the DHCP
   server then initiates the SACONFIGURATION exchange with the target
   server.

   This section describes how DHCP Server initiates exchange with a
   specific target server in SACONFIGURATION.

5.4.1.  Creation of SACONFIGURATION

   The DHCP server sets the "msg-type" field to SACONFIGURATION.  The
   DHCP server generates a transaction ID and inserts this value in the
   "transaction-id" field.  The DHCP server MUST include an OPTION_
   SERVERID option to identify itself to the target server which works
   as a DHCP client.  The DHCP server MUST include a SA Option specified
   in Section 5.1.2.4.

Internet-Draft        draft-madi-dhc-dhcpv6-psac-00         October 2010


5.4.2.  Transmission of SACONFIGURATION

   According to the requested-service-code of the Requestor's Parameters
   Option in the SA Request Option included in the REQUEST message and
   the address list of one certain local service, the DHCP server is
   able to choose an IP address of a proper target server for the
   requestor to establish SA.

   The DHCP server transmits SACONFIGURATION messages according to
   Section 14 of [RFC3315], using the following parameters:

   IRT SAC_TIMEOUT

   MRT SAC_MAX_RT

   MRC SAC_MAX_RC

   MRD 0

   If the message exchange fails, the DHCP server takes an action based
   on the local policy of the access network.  Examples of actions the
   DHCP server might take include:

   o Inform the client of the failure with denying offering service.

   o Inform the client of the failure while assigning IP address as
   usual.

5.4.3.  Receipt of SACONFIGURATION-REPLY

   A successful SACONFIGURATION-REPLY is one without an
   OPTION_STATUS_CODE option (or an OPTION_STATUS_CODE option with a
   success code).  Then the DHCP server responds to the requestor in the
   REPLY message with SA List Option to indicate the SA to be
   established between the requestor and one certain target server.

   An unsuccessful SACONFIGURATION-REPLY is one that has an
   OPTION_STATUS_CODE with an error code.  Depending on the status code,
   the DHCP server may try a different target server (such as for
   NotAllowed, and NotConfigured), try a different or corrected
   SACONFIGURATION request (such as for MalformedSACONFIGURATION and
   FailedRegistraion), or terminate the SACONFIGURATION request.

5.5.  Target Server Behavior

   A Target Server sends SACONFIGURATION-REPLY messages in response to
   valid SACONFIGURATION messages it receives to inform the DHCP server
   that the information conveyed by the SA Option has been configured.

5.5.1.  Receipt of SACONFIGURATION Messages

   Upon receipt of a valid SACONFIGURATION message, the target server
   updates the SA database it maintains and returns a SACONFIGURATION-
   REPLY.

   No matter whether the SA establishment has been successfully built,
   the target server configures itself the SA.  Once the lifetime of the
   SA index by SPI expires, the target server removes this SA.

   With SPI field of the SA Option, SAVP decides how to deal with the
   binding request described in SACONFIGURATION message:

   o If the SPI is new to the target server, the target server records
   the SA parameters included in the SACONFIGURATION message.

   o If the SPI has been maintained by the target server, the target
   server overwrites the SA parameters index by the SPI as an update.

   The target server constructs a SACONFIGURATION-REPLY message by
   setting the "msgtype" field to SACONFIGURATION-REPLY, and copying the
   transaction ID from the SACONFIGURATION message into the
   transaction-id field.  If the SA intended to be configured is not a
   proper one, the target server adds the error status code according to
   Section 5.1.3 and sends the SACONFIGURATION-REPLY to the DHCP server.

   If the target server fails to configure SA for some unknown reasons,
   the target server MAY discard the SACONFIGURATION message or MAY add
   an OPTION_STATUS_CODE option with the FailedSACONFIGURATION status
   code and send the SACONFIGURATION-REPLY to the DHCP server.

5.5.2.  Transmission of SACONFIGURATION-REPLY Messages

   The target server sends the SACONFIGURATION-REPLY message as
   described in the "Transmission of Reply Messages" section of
   [RFC3315].

5.6.  The extension brings to the DHCP exchange

   As in Section 5.1.2, some new defined options MUST be supported for
   the DHCP server solicitation.  And on the receipt of REQUEST message
   containing the SA Request Option from the requestor, the DHCP server
   initiates the SA establishment exchange with the intended target
   server before it assigns IP address and other network parameters for
   the requestor.

   The IP address registration exchange happens every time the DHCP
   server updates the lease on IP address assigned, which means once the

   DHCP server is ready to reply to the RENEW or REBIND message, the IP
   address registration exchange takes places before sending the these
   very messages for DHCP client.

6.  Security Considerations

   The original intention of the extension to DHCP for piggybacked SA
   configuration makes security consideration a necessity.  As mentioned
   before, the symmetric key to be used for IPSec should be in a
   confidential form.  By the virtue of the Client Public Key Option,
   the DHCP server is able to use client's public key to encrypt the
   symmetric key and included it in SA Option.  As for the very
   symmetric key transmission between the DHCP server and the target
   server, administrator MAY choose to make a key pre-shared between the
   DHCP server and the target server, or MAY employ the public key
   scheme for the encryption of the symmetric key shared between the
   DHCP server and the target server.

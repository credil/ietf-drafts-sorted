1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defined in [RFC3748] is
   an authentication framework that supports different types of
   authentication methods which are defined in EAP methods.  Originally
   designed for dial up connections, EAP is now commonly used for
   authentications in wireless access networks.  To allow faster re-
   authentications of previously authenticated peers, the EAP Re-
   authentication Protocol (ERP) was defined in [RFC5296].  ERP supports
   two forms of bootstrapping, i.e., "implicit bootstrapping" and
   "explicit bootstrapping".  Both forms of bootstrapping are used to
   derive EAP-based root keys for re-authentication and transport them
   to the local server that requested a root key for protecting re-
   authentication services to a peer.  Thus, ERP can be directly
   performed between a peer and the local server this peer is attached
   to without the need to communicate with the peer's home server in the
   home domain.

   [I-D.ietf-hokey-preauth-ps] defines EAP early authentication as the
   use of EAP by a mobile peer to establish authenticated keying
   material on a target attachment point prior to its arrival.  Here, a
   full EAP execution occurs before the handover of the peer takes
   place.  Hence, the goal of EAP early authentication is to complete
   all EAP-related communications in preparation for the handover
   including AAA signaling before the mobile device moves.

   Both of these method-independent optimized authentication protocols
   enable fast inter-authenticator handovers.  However, currently it is
   unclear how the necessary handover infrastructure is deployed and can
   be integrated into existing EAP infrastructures.  In particular, it
   still needs to be defined how EAP re-authentication (ER) servers
   should be integrated into local as well as home domain networks to
   allow optmized signalling overhead during handovers as well as better
   scalability.  This document focuses on different deployment scenarios
   of HOKEY architectures and HOKEY architecture design in the wireless
   environment.  The design objectives for HOKEY architecture and main
   components of HOKEY architecture will be discussed, and examples of
   how ERP and early authentication can be integrated into HOKEY
   architecture will be taken into account.

   Early Authentication Service

      Use of EAP by a mobile peer to establish authenticated keying
      material on a target attachment point prior to its arrival.

   Re-authentication Service

      Use of ERP by a mobile peer to make already existing keying
      material available to the target attachment point and use it for
      re-authentication during the handover.

   ER Server

      A logical entity that performs the server portion of ERP and may
      not necessarily be co-located with, or physically part of, a full
      EAP server, see [RFC5296].

   HOKEY Service

      Re-authentication service provided by the ER server to the peer or
      early authentication service provided by the EAP server/ER server
      to the peer.

   HkSh Home HOKEY Service

      Re-authentication service or Early authentication service provided
      by the home server with ERP support in the home domain to the
      peer.

   HkSv Visited HOKEY Service

      Re-authentication service or Early authentication service provided
      by the local server with ERP support in the visited domain of the
      peer.


3.  Design Goals

   This section investigates design goals for HOKEY architectures that
   help lowering the signalling overhead of re-authentications.

3.1.  Minimized Communications with Home Servers

   ERP requires only one rountrip, however, this rountrip may contain
   communications between a peer and its home ER and/or home AAA server
   even if the peer is currently attached to a visited (local) network.
   As a result, even this one rountrip may introduce long delays because
   home ER and home AAA servers may be far removed.  In order to lower

Internet-Draft          HOKEY Architecture Design           October 2009


   the signalling overhead, any communication with home ER and home AAA
   server should be minimized.  Ideally, a peer should only need to
   communicates with local servers and other local entities.

3.2.  Integrated Local Domain Name (LDN) Discovery

   Ideally, whenever a peer performs a handover, ERP is executed between
   the peer and a local ER server, thus, reducing handover latency by
   avoiding a full EAP authentication with the peer's home EAP server.
   In order for this to work, ERP bootstrapping must occur before
   (implicit) or during (explicit) a handover to tranport the necessary
   re-authentication root keys to the respective local ER server.
   Implicit bootstrapping is preferable because it does not require the
   communication with the home ER server during the handover (see
   previous section), but it requires the peer to know the domain name
   of the ER server in order to derive the necessary re-authentication
   keying material.  [RFC5296] does not specify such a domain name
   discovery mechanism and suggests that the peer may learn the domain
   name through the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message or via lower
   layer announcements.  To allow more efficient handovers, a HOKEY
   architecture should support an efficient way for a domain name
   discovery mechanism and allow its integration with ERP implicit
   bootstrapping.  Even in the case of explicit bootstrapping, local
   domain name discovery should be optimized such that it does not
   require contacting the home AAA server, as it is currentlty the case.

                      Figure 1 System Overview



   The HOKEY architecture is structured as three main EAP-based
   components, i.e., EAP-based handover key management, HOKEY
   authentication using handover key and optionally HOKEY authorization.

   The EAP-based handover key management consists of EAP method
   independent key derivation and distribution and comprises the
   following functional elements:

   o  Handover key derivation

   o  Handover key distribution

   The derivation and distribution of handover keys are defined in
   [RFC5295] and [I-D.ietf-hokey-key-mgm], respectively.

   The HOKEY authentication is focused on the inter-authenticator
   handover or inter-technology handover and comprises the following
   functional elements:

Internet-Draft          HOKEY Architecture Design           October 2009


   o  Full ERP authentication

   o  Local ERP authentication

   o  Early EAP Authentication

   ERP is defined in [RFC5296] and the early EAP authentication problem
   is described in [I-D.ietf-hokey-preauth-ps].

   HOKEY authorization is optional and can be used to verify whether a
   local ER server is authorized to advertize the domain name known to
   the peer.  This mechanism is currently implemented using an optional
   TLV payload in the EAP-Finished/Re-auth packet defined in [RFC5296].

4.2.  Local Domain Name (LDN) Discovery

   A LDN discovery mechanism is currently not defined for ERP even
   though it is necessary for implicit bootstrapping.  [RFC5295]
   suggests learning local domain names via the lower layer (e.g., L2 or
   L3 announcements) or from the EAP-Initiate/ Re-auth-Start message.
   An efficient mechanism needs to be defined and supported by the HOKEY
   architecture.


5.  Deployment Scenarios

5.1.  Scenario 1: Peer attached to home network, ER server in home
      network

   This scenario concentrates on the non-roaming case.  In this
   scenario, the HOKEY peer is attached to its home network which
   supports HOKEY service, as show in Figure 2.  In the home network,
   the ER server can be collocated with the EAP Server or separated from
   the EAP Server.  The NAS is on the path between the HOKEY peer and
   EAP/ER server.  When the NAS is on the path between the HOKEY peer
   and DHCP Server, it acts as DHCP relay.

5.2.  Scenario 2: Peer attached to visted network, ER server in visited
      network

   In this scenario, the HOKEY peer is located in the visited network
   and moves between NASs while the HOKEY services are provided by the
   local ER server in the visited network.  We refer to this as HkSv as
   shown in Figure 3.  The home EAP server located in the home network
   exports EAP-based root keys for handovers through full EAP exchanges
   and distributes them to local ER servers in the visited network.  The
   DHCP Server locating in the visited network may provide local domain
   name discovery to the local ER server and to the HOKEY peer.

5.3.  Scenario 3: Peer attached to visited network, ER server in home
      and visited network

   In this scenario, the HOKEY Peer is attached to a visited network and
   moves from previous NAS to the new NAS.  All HOKEY services are
   provided by both the home network and the visited network, as shown
   in Figure 4.  Therefore it is referred as hybrid case.  The Home ER
   Server can be collocated with Home EAP Server or separated from the
   home EAP Server in the home network.  The local ER Server can be
   collocated with EAP proxy or separated from EAP proxy in the visited
   network.

   1.  Implicit bootstrapping occurs in the initial full EAP execution
       when a peer first attaches to one domain or enters into a new
       domain.  The bootstrapping is used to transport local root keys
       (e.g., DSRK) to the local ER server.

   2.  Suppose the serving NAS is aware of the local domain name of the
       target NAS, then local ERP can be used between the peer and the
       serving NAS to request this local domain name for the peer.  In
       this case, it is out of the scope of this document how the
       serving NAS knows the local domain names.

   3.  When the peer moves to the target NAS, the peer uses the local
       domain name received from the serving NAS to perform ERP with the
       local ER server without involvement of the home EAP server.

   1.  Explicit ERP bootstrapping occurs in the initial full
       authentication with the home ER server when the peer first
       attaches to one domain or enters into a new domain.  It is used
       to re-authenticate the peer in the home domain and transports the
       local root key to the local ER server.  Also it is used to
       request the local domain name for the peer.

   2.  When the peer associates with the target authenticator, ERP in
       the local domain is used to re-authenticate the peer in the local
       domain.

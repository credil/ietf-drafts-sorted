Abstract

   This document specifies the conventions for using MAC-authenticated
   encryption with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) authenticated-
   enveloped-data content type.  This mirrors the use of a MAC combined
   with an encryption algorithm that's already employed in IPsec, SSL/
   TLS, and SSH, which is widely supported in existing crypto libraries
   and hardware, and has been extensively analysed by the crypto
   community.

2.  Background

   Integrity-protected encryption is a standard feature of session-
   oriented security protocols like [IPsec], [SSH], and [TLS], but until
   recently wasn't available for message-based security protocols like
   CMS, although [OpenPGP] added a form of integrity protection by
   encrypting a SHA-1 hash of the message alongside the message contents
   to provide authenticate-and-encrypt protection.  Usability studies
   have shown that users expect encryption to provide integrity
   protection [Garfinkel], creating cognitive dissonance problems when
   the security mechanisms don't in fact provide this assurance.

   This document applies the same encrypt-and-authenticate mechanism
   already employed in IPsec, SSH, and SSL/TLS, to CMS (technically some
   of these actually use authenticate-and-encrypt rather than encrypt-
   and-authenticate, since what's authenticated is the plaintext and not
   the ciphertext).  This mechanism is widely supported in existing
   crypto libraries and hardware, and has been extensively analysed by
   the crypto community [EncryptThenAuth].

3.  CMS Encrypt-and-Authenticate Overview

   Conventional CMS encryption uses a content encryption key (CEK) to
   encrypt a message payload.  Authenticated encryption requires two
   keys, one for encryption and a second one for authentication.  Like
   other mechanisms that use authenticated encryption, this document
   employs a pseudorandom function (PRF) to convert a single block of
   keying material into the two keys required for encryption and
   authentication.  This converts the standard CMS encryption operation:

       KEK( CEK ) || CEK( data )

   into:

       KEK( master_secret ) || MAC( CEK( data ) )

   where the MAC and encryption keys are derived from the master_secret
   via:

       MAC-K := PRF( master_secret, "authentication" );
       CEK-K := PRF( master_secret, "encryption" );

3.1.  Rationale

   There are several possible means of deriving the two keys required
   for the encrypt-and-authenticate process from the single key normally
   provided by the key exchange or key transport mechanisms.  Several of
   these however have security or practical issues.  For example any
   mechanism that uses the single exchanged key in its entirety for
   encryption (using, perhaps, PRF( key ) as the MAC key) can be
   converted back to unauthenticated data by removing the outer MAC
   layer and rewriting the CMS envelope back to plain EnvelopedData or
   EncryptedData.  By applying the PRF intermediate step, any attempt at
   a rollback attack will result in a decryption failure.

   The option chosen here, the use of a PRF to derive the necessary sets
   of keying material from a master secret, is well-established through
   its use in IPsec, SSH, and SSL/TLS, and is widely supported in both
   crypto libraries and in encryption hardware.

   The PRF used is PBKDF2 because its existing use in CMS makes it the
   most obvious candidate for such a function.  If in the future a
   universal PRF, for example [HKDF], is adopted then this can be
   substituted for PBKDF2 by specifying it in the prfAlgorithm field
   covered in Section 4.

   The resulting processing operations consist of a combination of the
   operations used for the existing CMS content types EncryptedData and

4.  CMS Encrypt-and-Authenticate

   The encrypt-and-authenticate mechanism is implemented within the
   existing CMS RecipientInfo framework by defining a new pseudo-
   algorithm type authEnc which is used in place of a monolithic encrypt
   and hash algorithm.  The RecipientInfo is used as a key container for
   the master secret used by the pseudo-algorithm from which the
   encryption and authentication keys for existing single-purpose
   encrypt-only and MAC-only algorithms are derived.  Thus instead of
   using the RecipientInfo to communicate (for example) an AES or HMAC-
   SHA1 key, it communicates an authEnc keying value from which the
   required AES encryption and HMAC-SHA1 authentication keys are
   derived.

   The authEnc pseudo-algorithm comes in two forms, one conveying 128
   bits of keying material and one conveying 256 bits:

       id-smime OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
                   us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 16 }

       id-alg  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-smime 3 }

       id-alg-authEnc-128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-alg 15 }
       id-alg-authEnc-256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-alg 16 }

   The algorithm parameters are:

       AuthEncParams ::= SEQUENCE {
           prfAlgorithm   [0] AlgorithmIdentifier DEFAULT PBKDF2,
           encAlgorithm       AlgorithmIdentifier,
           macAlgorithm       AlgorithmIdentifier
           }

      prfAlgorithm is the PRF algorithm used to convert the authEnc
      value into the encryption and MAC keys.  The default PRF is
      [PBKDF2] (which in turn has a default PRF algorithm of HMAC-SHA1).
      encAlgorithm is the encryption algorithm and associated parameters
      to be used to encrypt the content.
      macAlgorithm is the MAC algorithm and associated parameters to be
      used to authenticate/integrity-protect the content.

   When the PRF AlgorithmIdentifier is used to specify a PRF other than
   the default PBKDF2-with-HMAC-SHA1 one, the salt parameter MUST be an
   empty (zero- length) string and the iterationCount MUST be one, since
   these values aren't used in the PRF process.  In their encoded form,
   these two parameters have the value 08 00 02 01 01.

4.1.  Encrypt-and-Authenticate Message Processing

   The randomly-generated authEnc key to be communicated via the
   RecipientInfo(s) is converted to separate encryption and
   authentication keys and applied to the encrypt-and-authenticate
   process as follows.  The notation "PRF( key, salt, iterations )" is
   used to denote an application of the PRF to the given keying value
   and salt, for the given number of iterations:

   1.  The MAC algorithm key is derived from the authEnc key via:

           MAC-K ::= PRF( authEnc_key, "authentication", 1 );

   2.  The encryption algorithm key is derived from the authEnc key via:

           Enc-K ::= PRF( authEnc_key, "encryption", 1 );

   3.  The data is processed as described in [AuthEnv], and specifically
       since the mechanisms used are a union of EncryptedData and
       AuthenticatedData, as per [CMS].  The one exception to this is
       that the
       EncryptedContentInfo.ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier data is
       MACed before the encrypted content is MAced.  The EncryptedData
       processing is applied to the data first and then the
       AuthenticatedData processing is applied to the result, so that
       the nesting is:

           MAC( contentEncrAlgoID || encrypt( content ) );

   4.  If authenticated attributes are present then they are encoded as
       described in [AuthEnv] and MACed after the encrypted content, so
       that the processing is:

           MAC( contentEncrAlgoID || encrypt( content ) || authAttr );

4.2.  Rationale

   When choosing between encrypt-and-authenticate and authenticate-and-
   encrypt the more secure option is encrypt-and-authenticate.  There
   has been extensive analysis of this in the literature, the best
   coverage is probably [EncryptThenAuth].

   The EncryptedContentInfo.ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier is the
   SEQUENCE containing the id-alg-authEnc-128/id-alg-authEnc-256 OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER and its associated AuthEncParams.  This data is MACed
   exactly as encoded, without any attempt to re-code it into a
   canonical form like DER.

   The EncryptedContentInfo.ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier must be
   protected alongside the encrypted content otherwise an attacker could
   manipulate the encrypted data indirectly by manipulating the
   encryption algorithm parameters, which wouldn't be detected through
   MACing the encrypted content alone.  For example by changing the
   encryption IV it's possible to modify the results of the decryption
   after the encrypted data has been verified via a MAC check.

   The authEnc pseudo-algorithm has two "key sizes" rather than the one-
   size-fits-all that the PRF impedance-matching would provide.  This is
   done to address real-world experience in the use of AES keys where
   users demanded AES-256 alongside AES-128 because of some perception
   that the former was "twice as good" as the latter.  Providing an
   option for keys that go to 11 avoids potential user acceptance
   problems when someone notices that the authEnc pseudo-key has "only"
   128 bits when they expect their AES keys to be 256 bits long.

   Using a fixed-length key rather than making it a user-selectable
   parameter is done for the same reason as AES' quantised key lengths:
   there's no benefit to allowing, say, 137-bit keys over basic 128- and
   256-bit lengths, it adds unnecessary complexity, and if the lengths
   are user-defined then there'll always be someone who wants keys that
   go up to 12.  Providing a choice of two commonly-used lengths gives
   users the option of choosing a "better" key size should they feel the
   need, while not overloading the system with unneeded flexibility.

   The use of the PRF AlgorithmIdentifier presents some problems because
   it's usually not specified in a manner that allows it to be easily
   used as a straight KDF.  For example PBKDF2 has parameters:

       PBKDF2-params ::= SEQUENCE {
           salt OCTET STRING,
           iterationCount INTEGER (1..MAX),
           prf AlgorithmIdentifier {{PBKDF2-PRFs}}
                                   DEFAULT algid-hmacWithSHA1
           }

   of which only the prf AlgorithmIdentifier is used here.  In order to
   avoid having to define new AlgorithmIdentifiers for each possible
   PRF, this specification sets any parameters not required for KDF
   functionality to no-op values.  In the case of PBKDF2 this means that
   the salt has length zero and the iteration count is set to one, with
   only the prf AlgorithmIdentifier playing a part in the processing.
   Although it's not possible to know what form other PRFs-as-KDFs will
   take, a general note for their application within this specification
   is that any non-PRF parameters should similarly be set to no-op
   values.

   Specifying a MAC key size gets a bit tricky, most MAC algorithms have
   some de facto standard key size and for HMAC algorithms this is
   usually the same as the hash output size.  For example for HMAC-MD5
   it's 128 bits, for HMAC-SHA1 it's 160 bits, and for HMAC-SHA256 it's
   256 bits.  Other MAC algorithms also have de facto standard key
   sizes, for example for AES-based MACs it's the AES key size, 128 bits
   for AES-128 and 256 bits for AES-256.  This situation makes it
   difficult to specify the key size in a normative fashion since it's
   dependent on the algorithm type that's being used.  If there is any
   ambiguity over which key size should be used then it's recommended
   that the size be specified explicitly in the macAlgorithm
   AlgorithmIdentifier.

   As with other uses of PRFs for cryto impedance matching in protocols
   like IPsec, SSL/TLS and SSH, the amount of input to the PRF generally
   doesn't match the amount of output.  The general philosophical
   implications of this are covered in various analyses of the
   properties and uses of PRFs.  If you're worried about this then you
   can try and approximately match the authEnc "key size" to the key
   size of the encryption algorithm being used, although even there a
   perfect match for algorithms like Blowfish (448 bits) or RC5 (832
   bits) is going to be difficult.

   Apart from the extra step added to key management, all of the
   processing is already specified as part of the definition of the
   standard CMS content-types Encrypted/EnvelopedData and
   AuthenticatedData.  This significantly simplifies both the
   specification and the implementation task, as no new content-
   processing mechanisms are introduced.

4.3.  Test Vectors

   The following test vectors may be used to verify an implementation of
   MAC-authenticated encryption.  This represents a text string
   encrypted and authenticated using the password "Password" via CMS
   PasswordRecipientInfo.  The encryption algorithm used is triple DES,
   whose short block size (compared to AES) makes it easier to corrupt
   arbitrary bytes for testing purposes within the self-healing CBC mode
   which will result in correct decryption but a failed MAC check.

   The test data has the following characteristics:

      version is set to 0.
      originatorInfo isn't needed and is omitted.
      recipientInfos uses passwordRecipientInfo to allow easy testing
      with a fixed text string.

5.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute

   An S/MIME client SHOULD announce the set of cryptographic functions
   that it supports by using the S/MIME capabilities attribute [SMIME].
   If the client wishes to indicate support for MAC-authenticated
   encryption, the capabilities attribute MUST contain the authEnc128
   and/or authEnc256 OID specified above with algorithm parameters
   ABSENT.  The other algorithms used in the authEnc algorithm such as
   the MAC and encryption algorithm are selected based on the presence
   of these algorithms in the SMIMECapabilities or by mutual agreement.

6.  Security Considerations

   Unlike other CMS authenticated-data mechanisms like SignedData and
   AuthenticatedData, AuthEnv's primary transformation isn't
   authentication but encryption, so that AuthEnvData may decrypt
   successfully (in other words the primary data transformation present
   in the mechanism will succeed) but the secondary function of
   authentication using the MAC value that follows the encrypted data
   could still fail.  This can lead to a situation in which an
   implementation might output decrypted data before it reaches and
   verifies the MAC value.  In other words decryption is performed
   inline and the result is available immediately, while the
   authentication result isn't available until all of the content has
   been processed.  If the implementation prematurely provides data to
   the user and later comes back to inform them that the earlier data
   was, in retrospect, tainted, this may cause users to act prematurely
   on the tainted data.

   This situation could occur in a streaming implementation where data
   has to be made available as soon as possible (so that the initial
   plaintext is emitted before the final ciphertext and MAC value are
   read), or one where the quantity of data involved rules out buffering
   the recovered plaintext until the MAC value can be read and verified.
   In addition an implementation that tries to be overly helpful may
   treat missing non-payload trailing data as non-fatal, allowing an
   attacker to truncate the data somewhere before the MAC value and
   thereby defeat the data authentication.  This is complicated even
   further by the fact that an implementation may not be able to
   determine, when it encounters truncated data, whether the remainder
   (including the MAC value) will arrive presently (a non-failure) or
   whether it's been truncated by an attacker and should therefore be
   treated as a MAC failure.  (Note that this same issue affects other
   types of data authentication like signed and MACd data as well, since
   an over-optimistic implementation may return data to the user before
   checking for a verification failure is possible).

   The exact solution to these issues is somewhat implementation-
   specific, with some suggested mitigations being as follows:
   Implementations should buffer the entire message if possible and
   verify the MAC before performing any decryption.  If this isn't
   possible due to streaming or message-size constraints then
   implementations should consider breaking long messages into a
   sequence of smaller ones, each of which can be processed atomically
   as above.  If even this isn't possible then implementations should
   make obvious to the caller or user that an authentication failure has
   occurred and that the previously-returned or output data shouldn't be
   used.  Finally, any data-formatting problem such as obviously
   truncated data or missing trailing data should be treated as a MAC

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains two algorithm identifiers defined by the SMIME
   Working Group Registrar in an arc delegated by RSA to the SMIME
   Working Group: iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
   pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0).  No action by IANA is necessary for
   this document or any anticipated updates.

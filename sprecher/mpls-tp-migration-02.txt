Migration Considerations and Techniques to Multiprotocol Label Switching
             Transport  Profile based Networks and Services
                draft-sprecher-mpls-tp-migration-02.txt

Abstract

   MPLS-TP defines a packet-based network architecture and a
   comprehensive set of tools that allow service providers to reliably
   deliver next generation services and applications, in a simple,
   scalable, and cost-effective way.  Such services are BW-hungry based
   and require strict guaranteed SLA.  Delivering next generation
   services over MPLS-TP based network in an economic way, enables
   service providers to increase their revenue while remaining
   competitive.

   This document presents the motivations for migrating from different
   transport networks and services to MPLS-TP, and discusses the
   considerations and strategies for the migration.

   The document also proposes specific activities and techniques needed
   to ensure smooth migration path from the different transport networks
   and services to MPLS-TP

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview of MPLS-TP

   The Transport Profile for MPLS (MPLS-TP) is being specified in the
   IETF as part of a joint effort with the ITU-T to develop a definition
   of the MPLS network that will fulfill the strict requirements for
   transport networks that are accepted by the ITU-T.  This profile will
   be based on the definitions of the MPLS, MPLS Traffic Engineering,
   and Multi-Segment Pseudo-Wire architectures defined in [RFC3031],
   [RFC3985], and [RFC5659].

   The requirements for MPLS-TP are detailed in [RFC5654].  These
   requirements were developed in full cooperation between the IETF and
   ITU-T, and reflect the needs to adhere to the architecture of MPLS
   while including the enhanced level of service transparency, and
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functionality
   required for stable transport networks.  The requirements for the OAM
   functionality are further developed and defined in [MPLS-TP-OAM],
   providing the list of OAM procedures to be supported by MPLS-TP.

   The architecture for MPLS-TP is defined in [RFC5921] and builds on
   the experience of the MPLS architecture.  The architecture is defined
   to allow MPLS-TP networks to operate whether the configuration was
   implemented by use of control-plane signaling or through use of a
   management application.  In addition, the MPLS-TP architecture is
   designed to support networks that may not be using IP forwarding and
   addressing.  The framework defines the different service structures
   supported by MPLS-TP and the interworking between these service
   structures and existing MPLS services.  Also defined are the
   characteristics of the profile that defines MPLS-TP.  This synergy of
   architectures guarantees the service provider the ability to provide
   services with guaranteed and strict Service Level Agreements in a
   highly scalable robust network while reducing operational costs.

   A main focus of MPLS-TP is the definition of OAM functionality for
   MPLS data paths that support the transport services.  MPLS-TP

   provides a comprehensive set of OAM tools for fault management and
   performance monitoring, supporting the network and the services at
   different nested levels (i.e. at the end-to-end level, a segment of a
   path, and link level).  The OAM tools may be used to monitor the
   network infrastructure, to enhance the general behavior, and
   performance level of the network.  The tools may also be used to
   monitor the service level offered to the end customer, allowing
   verification of the SLA parameters, and enabling rapid response in
   the event of a failure or service degradation.  The OAM tools help
   reduce OPEX, minimizing the overhead of trouble shooting, and
   enhancing customer satisfaction which, in turn, helps to enable the
   delivery of high-margin premium services.

   The architectural constructs and the methodology of the OAM
   functionality is defined by [MPLS-TP-OAM-Fwk].  This includes the
   definition of the transport entities that are monitored by the OAM
   procedures and detailed description of how the OAM procedures are
   applied to these transport entities.  A central issue in MPLS-TP OAM
   is the independence of the OAM from the existence of an operational
   control plane in the network.  This feature is supported by the
   creation of an in-band control channel that is used to transmit the
   OAM procedures across the transport paths.  A cornerstone of the
   definition of the OAM procedures is to use existing IETF OAM tools as
   the basis of the MPLS-TP OAM procedures wherever possible, this
   principle is used as the underlying foundation for the definition of
   the OAM tools defined for MPLS-TP.

   Protection mechanisms for the MPLS-TP transport paths are described
   in [MPLS-TP-Surviv] and are conformant with different topological
   configurations of the network.

1.2.  Motivations for Upgrading Networks

   The growth of packet traffic has significantly increased, driven by
   the high demand and penetration of new packet-based services and
   multimedia applications, across the access, aggregation and core
   networks and is being expected to continue to increase.  With the
   movement towards packet-based services, the transport network has to
   evolve to encompass the provision of packet-aware capabilities while
   enabling carriers to leverage their installed, as well as planned,
   transport infrastructure investments.

   Carriers are in need of technologies capable of efficiently
   supporting packet-based services and applications on their transport
   networks with guaranteed Service Level Agreements (SLAs).  The need
   to increase their revenue while remaining competitive forces
   operators to look for the lowest network Total Cost of Ownership
   (TCO), and as such requires investment in equipment and facilities

   (Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) be
   minimized.

   There are a number of technology options for carriers to meet the
   challenge of increased service sophistication and transport
   efficiency, with increasing usage of hybrid packet-transport and
   circuit-transport technology solutions.  To address this challenge,
   it is essential that packet-transport technology be available that
   can provide reliability, operational simplicity - preserving the look
   and feel to which service providers have accustomed, multi-layer
   operations, resiliency, control, and multi-technology management.

   Transport carriers require control and deterministic usage of network
   resources.  They need end-to-end control to engineer network paths
   and to efficiently utilize network resources.  They require
   capabilities to support static (management-plane-based) or dynamic
   (control-plane-based) provisioning of deterministic, protected, and
   secured services and their associated resources.  For transport
   carriers, it is also important to ensure smooth interworking of the
   packet transport network with other existing/legacy packet networks,
   and provide mappings to enable packet transport carriage over a
   variety of transport network infrastructures.

   MPLS is a maturing packet technology and it is already playing an
   important role in transport networks and services.  The development
   of MPLS-TP has proposed a set of compatible technology enhancements
   to existing MPLS standards to extent the definition of MPLS towards
   supporting traditional transport operational models.  These
   enhancements inherit all the supporting QoS, recovery, control and
   data plane mechanisms already defined within standards.  MPLS-TP will
   enable the deployment of packet-based transport networks that will
   efficiently scale to support packet services in a simple and cost-
   effective way.

3.  General Migration Strategies

   Smooth migration paths are required when migrating from various
   transport networks and services towards the MPLS-TP-based packet-
   centric architecture, and it should be done in a cost- efficient and
   scalabel way.  Smooth migration is required to enable service
   providers to maintain their existing investments in the installed
   base for as long as economically justifiable.

   For service providers, smooth migration path and seamless
   interworking between the installed networks and the MPLS-TP based
   network, also eliminate the risks associated with fork-lifting
   upgrade on the whole network on one day with a new technology or
   implementation.  This approach allows service providers to ensure
   that the new implementations work as expected in live networks and
   that the customers' quality of experience is maintained and not
   affected.

   The seamless interworking between the installed network and te
   MPLS-TP network networks should consider aspects of data-plane, OAM
   and recovery mechanisms, control plane and management-plane

   The migration process must obviously be performed without a service
   break.  Existing connections must not be disrupted and service
   performance, availability, and subscriber experience must remain
   unaffected.

   When the upgrade process is completed, new connections can ne setup
   using MPLS-TP.

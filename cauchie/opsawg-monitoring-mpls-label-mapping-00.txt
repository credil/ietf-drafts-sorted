                A method to monitor MPLS label mappings
         draft-cauchie-opsawg-monitoring-mpls-label-mapping-00

Abstract

   Because one MPLS label only identifies one single flow on a link
   between two MPLS routers, information related to one MPLS label is
   exchanged only between (physically and logically) neighbour routers.
   In other words, MPLS label have a link-local significance on which
   two neighbour routers have previously agreed on.  It is therefore not
   a trivial task for a network operator to know where a flow is going
   as it implies to retreive the MPLS labels mappings on each hops in
   order to get a complete view of end-to-end LSP paths.  This taks is
   even harder when it comes to get the MPLS label mappings over time in
   a purpose of monitoring and/or troubleshooting network services.

   This document thus defines a new method to monitor MPLS label
   mappings that collects and stores MPLS labels mapping information so
   as to offer to one IP/MPLS network operator a reliable and clear view
   of its network LSPs end-to-end establishment over time while
   minimising the impact on network convergence and router CPU.

Internet-Draft       Monitoring MPLS Label Mappings         October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Since many years now, MPLS tunnels (defined in [RFC3031]) are more
   and more used in IP networks to carry many services (native IP,
   VPNs,etc.) and offer them isolation, Fast Reroute potential and/or
   differentiated quality of service.  To ease MPLS tunnels (ie MPLS
   LSPs) establishment and rerouting, protocols to dynamically
   distribute MPLS labels mapping (like LDP [RFC5036] and RSVP-TE
   [RFC3209]) have been developped and improved over the years.  These
   protocols succeded in this task so that today network operators are
   managing hundreds, thousands or more LSPs in their network.

   While the establishment of MPLS LSPs became so easy for operators,
   monitoring and furthermore troubleshooting MPLS LSPs events didn't
   quite follow the same path.  Because of its local significant labels
   and its "link-local scope" information exchange, MPLS LSPs monitoring
   and troubleshooting can only be fairly accomplished if an operator
   has a complete view of events occuring on each MPLS routers.

   In the last few years, many mechanisms have been designed to give
   operators a better real-time view of their MPLS LSPs.  It is now
   possible to quickly and accurately localize the routers causing the
   MPLS LSP down event and start working on resolving the issue.  But
   things gets complicated, not to say unfeasible, when one customer
   complaigns for a problem that occured the day before for instance.

   Having a MPLS labels mappings monitoring system that can offer the
   knowledge of all the label mappings in use over time and that keeps
   from loading the routers in the busy CPU periods will help one MPLS
   network operator to gain important information to monitor and
   troubleshoot its MPLS network while minimizing the impact on the
   routers which can advertise the new mappings after making sure
   rerouting is done.  Furthermore, by knowing the location and duration
   of labels mapping disruption, one operator can easily report the
   potential damages and take a look to the guilty routers to find the
   disruption cause, increasing its troubleshooting performance.

   The rest of the docuemnt is structured as follows: Section 2 sets the
   global architecture where all MPLS routers participate in sending the
   proper label mapping information to one or more servers, Section 3
   defines the procedures and message encoding in order to achieve
   interoperability between the servers and the routers.


2.  Architecture

Internet-Draft       Monitoring MPLS Label Mappings         October 2010


2.1.  Principles

   As per the MPLS Architecture [RFC3031] definition, one packet or
   frame entering the MPLS world is first bound to a label.  This
   binding is placed in the FTN (FEC-to-NHLFE) table of one LER (Label
   Edge Router).  Then, this labeled packet is switched on a hop-by-hop
   basis as specified in the ILM (Incoming Label Map) table of each LSR
   routers along the path until the last hop.  Monitoring one MPLS LSP
   thus requires to have the FTN and ILM knowledge at each LSP hop.

   This MPLS label monitoring method then consists in gathering the FTN
   and ILM information (called from now on in this document as "label
   mappings information") of each MPLS routers in an IP/MPLS network.
   These label mappings information are then sent by all MPLS routers in
   the network to one or more servers (for potential redundancy or load
   sharing) for storage in order to obtain the complete view of the way
   unlabeled and labeled packets are managed in the network MPLS
   environment.  Information is also required to be timestamped by the
   routers and updated over time to reflect the changes and the moment
   of these changes in the network (for troubleshooting or other network
   studies).

   Information is encoded in XML format [W3C.REC-xml].  Advantages of
   XML are its flexibility for easy evolutions, its self-documented
   scheme and the set of tools already alvailable on the server side to
   compute the set of received information.  Disadvantage of XML is its
   bulk size, that's why information shall be compressed before it is
   sent by the router over the wire (as approached in
   [I-D.cheng-grow-bgp-xml]).

   Compressed XML information is transported over TCP in order to ensure
   correct and complete exchanges.

   One requirement of this method is to have no impact on the network
   convergence performance.  As one incentive for this method is to
   perform MPLS LSP monitoring, one may find this requirement in
   contradiction with the incentive.  Monitoring is indeed important to
   trigger human reaction.  But since we have routing protocols to
   dynamically reroute the traffic in an order of magnitude far better
   than human reactions, it is essential for Service providers to
   prioritize routing convergence before sending the monitoring
   information about label mappings.  That is why label mappings
   information must be sent in moments when the router is having a low
   CPU usage.  Timestamping the label mappings information with the time
   when route convergence occured is again important as the time when
   the information is sent over to the server may always be done later
   than the time when changes have occured in the network.

Internet-Draft       Monitoring MPLS Label Mappings         October 2010


   Another requirement of this method is to be independant from the
   protocol used to distribute the mappings.  As a consequence,
   description of label mappings do not presuppose that either LDP
   [RFC5036] or RSVP-TE [RFC3209]) protocols were used.  This
   indifference works also for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint
   LSPs, SPF-computed routed LSPs and explicitely routed LSPs, etc.

   What the server receiveing the label mappings information does of
   these information is beyond the scope of this document.

2.2.  Interests

   In the last few years, new OAM mechanisms (such as VCCV) have been
   designed to give operators a better real-time view of their MPLS
   LSPs.  These tools are really satisfying for investigations when a
   problem is occuring but can not be used to understand where a failure
   had happened in the past.  Interest of the monitoring solution
   defined in this document is not only to have a representation of the
   MPLS LSPs in place in the network but also to gain an history of
   active label mappings in order to be able to get back in time and see
   what mappings were used at a specific time to get a better
   understanding of the environment and localize where (and for how
   long) the problem occured and how many times it has occured (for
   service availability calculation).

   Already known and deployed protocols could also be used to get the
   label mappings, like SNMP [RFC1157] for instance.  However, SNMP
   presents some disadvantages compared to this solution.  On one hand,
   when using 'SNMP gets', one network operator has to poll all routers
   at regular intervals.  These intervals must then be as short as as
   possible in order not to miss any changes, implying a huge
   sollicitation of all routers sending their complete mappings.  And as
   the experience shows that mappings are pretty stable over time, it is
   at the end a big waste of consumed bandwidth and CPU ressources in
   comparison to the fact of only sending changes when they occur.
   Furthermore, shortening the intervals is not stricly sufficient to
   ensure a knwoledge of the precise changes time.  And finally, queries
   can reach routers at rerouting times, thus adding load to the router
   and impact the network convergence.  On the other hand, when using
   SNMP traps, one network operator loses the reliability offered by
   TCP, for instance when micro routing loops are appearing in the
   network and packets are lost on the way.

   At the end, this solution is gathering all the pros of existing
   solutions by giving a complete view of the MPLS LSPs like with 'SNMP
   gets', react to changes like 'SNMP traps', provide precise timing
   information like syslog messages, and transmit the information in a
   reliable and standardized/common way that is independent of one's

   implementation specificities and protocol usage.  Furthermore, the
   exchanged data is not penalizing the network convergence performance
   and the use of XML provides an easy mechanism for evolutions without
   requiring changes in the specification.


3.  Procedures and format

3.1.  connection establishment

   For security reason, the router is responsible of the connection
   initiation.  Hence, one router MUST NOT accept TCP SYN messages on
   TCP ports one implementor may assign to label mappings monitoring.

   It is RECOMMENDED for the connection to remain constantly open.
   Having a permanently open connection allows to easily and quickly
   detect router failure as a server receiving a TCP SYN will
   automatically know that some restart happened on the router, but on
   the other side, a server has to maintain many connections in parallel
   over which generally no messages are sent or received.  Having a
   connection open on demand has the advantage of unloading the server
   with hundreds of parallel connections.  However, mechanisms must be
   defined to differentiate a router restart from a classical change
   advertisement and to take the according actions.

   Once TCP connection is established, the router MUST send all its
   label mappings to the server.  The timestamp used SHALL be set to the
   time when the TCP connection opens.

3.2.  Messages for label mapping description

3.2.1.  Messages format

   To perform an MPLS label mapping monitoring, one router must send its
   MPLS forwarding entries to the server.  As previously said, [RFC3031]
   defines that MPLS forwarding entries are fed by the entries from the
   FTN and the ILM tables.  Some implementations today are mixing
   information from the two tables into one single table usually called
   "label bindings" table.  But at the end, the mandatory information
   needed to perform the label mappings monitoring, that MUST be
   advertised by routers to the server, are:

   o  router ID

   o  FEC

   o  ingress label value

Internet-Draft       Monitoring MPLS Label Mappings         October 2010


   o  forwarding operation

   o  timestamp

   Router ID is either the unique IPv4 or IPv6 address identifying the
   router in the network.

   The FEC identifies the flow to be mapped into the LSP tunnel.  It can
   thus be either IP prefixes for legacy IP over MPLS LSPs, a so-called
   VRF-id for a L3VPN [RFC4364] service or a so-called VSI-id/AC-id
   respectively for a VPLS/VPWS [RFC4664] service.  A VRF-id is a tupple
   containing both the loopback address of the PE router and the Route-
   Distinguisher (RD) in order to identify the targeted VRF inside a
   VPN.  A VSI-id (or AC-id) is a tupple containing both the loopback
   address of the PE router and the Pseudo-Wire ID (PWid) in order to
   identify the targeted VSI (or AC) inside a VPN.  FEC information can
   be to unknown for cases like LSR where an LSP is explicitely routed
   LSP or manually configured.

   The ingress label value is the label value of incoming labelled
   packets the router is ready to forward.  A "-1" value of the ingress
   label indicates a FTN entry for untagged packets or frame entering
   the MPLS environment.  The ingress label value field can contain
   multiple values if, for instance, a label space per interface is in
   use.  This is why a label value MUST be associated with an origin
   value.  The origin value can be:

   o  'untagged' value for packets or frame entering the MPLS
      environment,

   o  'service' value for packets or frame that just received the inner
      label corresponding to the destinated VRF, VSI or AC

   o  'platform' value if the label value was received on a session with
      a per platform label space use,

   o  the upstream router Router_ID if the label value was received on a
      session with a per interface label space use

   The forwarding operation is a tupple of 3 different information.
   First is the "label operation", which is the set of push, pop or swap
   actions the router will perform for ingress packets that fall into
   the FEC conditions or for ingress labelled packets whose label value
   is equal to the ingress label value.  Other possible values of the
   "label operation field" is "none" so as to indicate that the router
   entry for the ingress label value is no more in use, and "replicate"
   in the case of P2MP LSPs with multiple branches.  Second is the
   "egress label value", which is the label value resulting from the

Internet-Draft       Monitoring MPLS Label Mappings         October 2010


   label operation action.  The egress label value "-1" is to be used
   when the ingress label value entry is no more in use or when the
   label operation is "pop".  Third is the "next-hop information", which
   can be:

   o  the next-hop IP address to where the label is to be forwarded,

   o  'FEC', indicating that the packet/frame is to be delivered outside
      the MPLS environment,

   o  'recursive', indicating that the label at the top of the label
      stack will be check by the router for forwarding

   Timestamp is the time when the label mapping decribe by the previous
   items became active.  This timestamp SHALL be encoded in a unix
   format with the addition of microseconds information.

   Examples of messages in different MPLS context are given in the next
   section.

   Then optional information can be added to the label mapping
   information set.  For instance, SNMP indexes, neighbour identity
   and/or LSP encoding types can be added to the set of mandatory
   information.  Use of options is left to implementors.

3.2.2.  Message examples

   This section illutrates the message format describe in the previous
   section in three different context.

3.2.2.1.  L3VPN context with Penultimate-hop popping (PHP)

   The network configuration for this context is described in Figure 1.
   The label mapping information describe the LSP used in order for
   VRF_1 to reach the VRF_2 as a whole (ie one prefix per VRF
   configuration is used) and the LSP used as a transport between
   routers R1 and R3 (ie the outter label).  This context does not
   assume any other LSPs used as transport, uses only per platfrom label
   space, and makes router R2 use Penultimate-hop Popping.

   The label mapping information describe the LSP used in order for AC_1
   to reach the AC_2 (identified with the inner label) and the LSP used
   as a transport between routers R1 and R3 (identified with the outter
   label).  This context does not assume any other LSPs used as

5.  Security Considerations

   This method is not supposed to introduce new security concerns on the
   routers for two reasons.  Firstly, because the router must not accept
   incoming connection from any parties for this topic, and secondly
   because even if a third-party is performing a Man-in-the-middle
   attack, the router must not accept incoming packets except TCP ACK
   packets.

   Other concerns may impact the server, receiving the TCP connection
   establishment from the routers and storing the label mappings
   information.  But this is out the scope of the document.

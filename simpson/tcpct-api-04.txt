Abstract

   TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) [RFC6013] deter spoofing of           |
   connections and prevent resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder
   (server) state during the initial handshake.  The Initiator (client)
   has sole responsibility for ensuring required delays between
   connections.  The cookie exchange may carry data, limited to inhibit
   amplification and reflection denial of service attacks.

   This document provides a sockets Application Program Interface (API)
   to support "basic" and "advanced" TCPCT applications.  TCP/IP
   applications written using the sockets API have enjoyed a high degree
   of portability.

1.  Introduction

   This specification is based upon prior work product by the author for
   a Linux implementation, and previous internal documents Copyright (C)
   William Allen Simpson (2009-2011).


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "OPTIONAL", "RECOMMENDED",
   "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  sysctl

   tcp_cookie_size - INTEGER
      Default: 16.  Maximum: 16.  System default size of TCP Cookie
      Transactions (TCPCT) option, that may be overridden by the TCPCT
      socket option.  Values greater than the maximum (16) are
      interpreted as the maximum.  Values greater than zero and less
      than the minimum (8) are interpreted as the minimum.  Odd values
      are interpreted as the next even value.

   When tcp_cookie_size is 0, the TCP stack will not send the Cookie
   Option, and any incoming Cookie Option will be silently discarded.

   When tcp_cookie_size is greater than 0, the TCP stack will always
   send the Cookie Option, and any incoming Cookie Option will be
   processed.  This is most useful for single purpose systems, such as
   DNS or HTTP servers.

   Either case may be modified for each socket or connection.

   tcp_syn_data_limit - INTEGER
      Default: 496.  Maximum: 496.  System maximum amount of data
      transmitted with the <SYN>.

   tcp_syn_ack_data_limit - INTEGER
      Default: 80.  Maximum: 1220.  System maximum amount of data
      transmitted with the <SYN,ACK(SYN)>.  As a matter of security
      policy, keep the initial setting small for most systems to avoid   |
      their use in amplification denial of service attacks.

   Note that usage of <SYN>-data requires the socket option.

   As a matter of policy, these limits MAY be considerably smaller.

3.  Socket Option

     #define TCP_COOKIE_TRANSACTIONS

   When this symbol is defined, the TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT)      |
   socket option is available.


3.1.  struct tcp_cookie_transactions

     /* for TCP_COOKIE_TRANSACTIONS (TCPCT) socket option */
     #define TCP_COOKIE_MIN           8              /*  64-bits */

     #define TCP_COOKIE_PAIR_SIZE    (2*TCP_COOKIE_MAX)

     /* Flags for both getsockopt and setsockopt */
     #define TCPCT_IN_ALWAYS         (1 << 0)

     #define TCPCT_IN_DATA           (1 << 2)
     #define TCPCT_OUT_DATA          (1 << 3)

     /* Extended Option flags for both getsockopt and setsockopt */
     #define TCPCT_EXTEND_SIZE       (0x7)           /* mask */
     #define TCPCT_EXTEND_TS32       (0x1)           /* default */
     #define TCPCT_EXTEND_TS64       (0x2)
     #define TCPCT_EXTEND_TS128      (0x4)

     /* TCP_COOKIE_TRANSACTIONS socket option header */
     struct tcp_cookie_transactions {
             uint16_t        tcpct_flags;
             uint8_t         tcpct_extended;
             uint8_t         tcpct_cookie_desired;
             uint16_t        tcpct_s_data_desired;
             uint16_t        tcpct_used;
     };

   The structure is 64 bits.

   tcpct_flags

      TCPCT_IN_ALWAYS
         Default: 0 (off).  Silently discard any incoming <SYN> or
         <SYN,ACK(SYN)> that is missing the Cookie option.

      TCPCT_OUT_NEVER
         Default: 0 (off).  Refuse to send (override) the Cookie option.
         This supercedes any other settings to the contrary.

      TCPCT_IN_DATA

         getsockopt()
            Indicates <SYN> or <SYN,ACK(SYN)> data has been received.

         setsockopt()
            Ignored.


      TCPCT_OUT_DATA

         getsockopt()
            Indicates <SYN> or <SYN,ACK(SYN)> data has been sent on the
            connection.

            When tcpct_s_data_desired is zero, constant data was sent.

         setsockopt()
            Indicates <SYN> or <SYN,ACK(SYN)> constant data MAY be sent;
            tcpct_used contains the total number of bytes.

            Do not wait for additional data before sending;
            tcpct_s_data_desired MUST be zero.

            Setting the data value only has utility for a Responder.     +
            Initiators MUST use tcpct_s_data_desired instead.


      TCPCT_EXTEND
         Indicates tcpct_extended field contains a non-default value.

      TCPCT_RETAIN                                                       +
         When this symbol is defined, the optional TCPCT Rapid Restart   +
         [TCPCTRR] feature is available.                                 +

         Default: 0 (off).  Indicates TCPCT TCB SHOULD be retained for   +
         rapid restart.

      Unused bits MUST be zero.

   tcpct_extended

      TCPCT_EXTEND_SIZE
         Mask for Size field in Extended Option.  If Size is set to an

         unrecognized value (or zero), the TCP Timestamps Extended
         Option MUST NOT be sent, and MUST be ignored upon receipt.

      TCPCT_EXTEND_TS32
         Use 32-bit timestamps extension (default).

      TCPCT_EXTEND_TS64
         Use 64-bit timestamps extension.

      TCPCT_EXTEND_TS128
         Use 128-bit timestamps extension.

      If the TCPCT_EXTEND flag is not set (default), this field MUST be
      ignored, but SHOULD be set to either the default value or zero.

   tcpct_cookie_desired
      Values: 0 (default), 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.  Send the Cookie option
      with the <SYN> or <SYN,ACK(SYN)>.

      Whenever this field is zero, use tcp_cookie_size instead.

   tcpct_s_data_desired
      Default: 0.  The maximum amount of data transmitted with the <SYN>
      (up to tcp_syn_data_limit) or the <SYN,ACK(SYN)> (up to
      tcp_syn_ack_data_limit).

      Whenever this field is non-zero, wait for data before sending.
      Unlike tcpct_cookie_desired, this field MUST be set explicitly;
      there is no system value.

   tcpct_used
      Default: 0.  Number of bytes used in the variable length data
      value.

   This header is optionally followed by variable length data.

3.2.  struct tcpct_full and struct tcpct_half

     /* TCP_COOKIE_TRANSACTIONS cookie values */
     struct tcpct_full {
             struct tcp_cookie_transactions soh;
             uint8_t         tcpct_value[TCP_COOKIE_PAIR_SIZE];
     };


     struct tcpct_half {
             struct tcp_cookie_transactions soh;
             uint8_t         tcpct_value[TCP_COOKIE_MAX];
     };

   The structures are a multiple of 64 bits.  These are provided for
   convenience, such as stack allocation.

   tcpct_value

      getsockopt()
         The current cookie or cookie pair value; tcpct_used contains
         the total number of bytes.  Use tcpct_full.

         For an established connection, tcpct_cookie_desired will
         contain the cookie size.

      setsockopt()
         The constant cookie or cookie pair value; tcpct_used contains
         the total number of bytes.  Use tcpct_full or tcpct_half as
         appropriate.

         TCPCT_OUT_DATA is not set (MUST be zero).  Any previously       |
         specified constant data is discarded.

         To distinguish a maximal cookie from a minimal cookie pair,
         tcpct_cookie_desired MUST equal tcpct_used or half of
         tcpct_used.

         Setting the cookie value only has utility for an Initiator, as
         receipt of an Initiator cookie and calculation of the response
         will replace the cookie pair in the Responder socket.

      Unused bytes MUST be zero.

Acknowledgments

   Andre Broido informally described utilizing cookies for Transport     |
   Layer Security (TLS) session identifiers, in place of the [RFC5077]
   ticket.  Rapid TLS session resumption would improve both latency and
   privacy, but is beyond the scope of this specification.


IANA Considerations

   This specification registers two new TCP options.  These (previously
   unpublished) options were specifically selected to avoid conflicts,
   and IANA was advised in advance.

   TCP Cookie Option
   Kind: 31
   Length: variable.

   TCP Timestamps Extended Option
   Kind: 32
   Length: 4.

   Notes: Kind 31 is a prime number, particularly appropriate for a
   security enhancement.  Kind 32 is a multiple of TCP Timestamps Option
   (Kind 8); Kind 16 was already registered.


Security Considerations

   First and foremost, the cookie exchange improves operational security
   for vulnerable servers against flooding attacks.  All other semantics
   are subordinate.

   TCPCT provides a number of new security mechanisms that need to be
   accessible to applications.

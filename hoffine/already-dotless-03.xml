<abstract>

<t>Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board and ICANN's Security and Stability
Advisory Committee have discussed the problems that the DNS is likely to experience with top-level
domains that have address records in them (so-called "dotless domains"). However, these statements
spoke of the problem mostly as theoretical, when in fact there are such TLDs today.
This document lists the current dotless TLDs, and gives a script for finding them. This document
lists data about dotless TLDs, but does not address the policy and technology issues
other than to point to the statements of others.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>In the past few years, well-respected groups have issued documents about top-level domains in the
DNS that have address records in them (so-called "dotless domains"). The Security and Stability
Advisory Committee (SSAC) of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) issued
a report called "Report on Dotless Domains" in February, 2012 <xref target="SAC053"/>. The Internet
Architecture Board (IAB) issued a statement called "Dotless Domains Considered Harmful" <xref
target="IAB-DOTLESS"/> in July, 2013.
The New gTLD Program Committee of the ICANN Board of Directors (NGPC) approved a resolution
on dotless domains <xref target="NGPC-DOTLESS"/> in August, 2013.
(The authors of this document note that they are on none of
the SSAC, the IAB, nor the ICANN Board.)
</t>

<t>Both of these documents consider the effects of dotless domains without describing the extent
of their current deployment.
In order to help researchers determine the extent
of the problems with dotless domains, this document lists the known dotless domains at the time of
publication, and shows how researchers can find them in the future. This document is meant to provide
current data to the Internet community, but does not give advice.</t>

<t>Many people have expressed a belief that ICANN prohibits all TLDs
from being dotless. That belief is not true; ICANN's policies apply only to their
contracted TLDs.</t>

</section>

<section title="Current Dotless Domains">

<t>The following shows the data found on September XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, 2013.
The authors note that the data was fairly constant for many months, with very few
additions or deletions or records.</t>

<t>
We checked every TLD in the root zone to see which ones had A, AAAA,
or MX records.  We found that about 5% of the TLDs did, and all of the
TLDs that do are two letter TLDs (which are also known as ccTLDs).
</t>

<section title="TLDs with A Records">

<t>At the time this document is published, the following TLDs have A records.</t>

<figure><artwork>
AC has address 193.223.78.210
AI has address 209.59.119.34

<section title="TLDs with AAAA Records">

<t>At the time this document is published, the following TLD has an AAAA record.</t>

<figure><artwork>
DK has IPv6 address 2a01:630::40:b1a:b1a:2011:1

</section>

<section title="TLDs with MX Records">

<t>At the time this document is published, the following TLDs have MX records. The SSAC report
implies, but does not explicitly say,
that MX records would cause a TLD to be considered dotless; the IAB
report does not mention MX records at all.</t>

<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>The script in Appendix A relies on IANA continuing to publish a copy of the TLDs in the root zone
at http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>This document lists the known dotless domains; it does not express an opinion
whether or not there are security considerations with the existence of dotless
domains. The referenced IAB and SSAC reports discuss the opinions of the respective
bodies on the security and stability considerations of dotless domains.</t>

<section anchor="Script" title="Script for Finding Dotless Domains">

<t>The following Bourne shell script was used for finding the data in this document. The authors
believe that this script will work correctly on a wide variety of operating
systems, and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. As is customary
in the current legal environment,
the authors make no assurance that the script is correct or that the script will
not cause damage on a system where it is run.</t>

<t>The script checks each nameserver for each TLD instead of just doing a simple query because the
nameservers for some of the TLDs have inconsistent data in them with respect to the records shown
here.</t>

1. Introduction

   [PBB-VPLS Model] describes how PBB can be integrated with VPLS to
   allow for useful PBB capabilities while continuing to avoid the use
   of MSTP in the backbone. The combined solution referred as PBB-VPLS
   results in better scalability in terms of number of service
   instances, PWs and C-MACs that need to be handled in the VPLS PEs.

   This document describes optional extensions to LDP Signaling
   procedures described in [RFC4762] required to add desirable
   capabilities to PBB-VPLS solution.

   Section 2 gives a quick terminology reference. Section 3 covers the
   problem space. Section 4 describes the solution and required TLV
   extensions.

2. General terminology

   Some general terminology is defined here; most of the terminology
   used is from [IEEE802.1ah], [RFC4762] and [RFC4026]. Terminology
   specific to this memo is introduced as needed in later sections.

   802.1ah: IEEE specification for "MAC tunneling" encapsulation and
   bridging of frames across a provider backbone bridged network.

   PBB: Provider Backbone Bridge

   BEB: A backbone edge bridge positioned at the edge of a provider
   backbone bridged network. It can contain an I-component, B-component
   or both I and B components.

   BCB: A backbone core bridge positioned at the core of a provider
   backbone bridged network. It contains only B-component.

   B-TAG:  field defined in the 802.1ah provider MAC encapsulation
   header that conveys the backbone VLAN identifier information. The
   format of the B-TAG field is the same as that of an 802.1ad S-TAG
   field.

   B-MAC: The backbone source or destination MAC address fields defined
   in the 802.1ah provider MAC encapsulation header.

   B-component, referred here also as B-VPLS: A bridging component
   contained in BEBs and BCBs that bridges in the provider backbone
   space based on B-MAC and B-TAG information

   I-TAG: A field defined in the 802.1ah provider MAC encapsulation
   header that conveys the service instance information (I-SID)
   associated with the frame.

   I-SID: The 24-bit service instance field carried inside the I-TAG. I-
   SID defines the service instance that the frame should be "mapped
   to".

   S-TAG: A field defined in the 802.1ad QinQ encapsulation header that
   conveys the service VLAN identifier information (S-VLAN).

   S-VLAN: The specific service VLAN identifier carried inside an S-TAG

   I-component: A bridging component contained in a backbone edge bridge

   and S-TAG information

2.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.



3. PBB Blackholing issue

   In PBB-VPLS solution a B-component VPLS (B-VPLS) may be used as
   infrastructure for one or more I-component instances. B-VPLS control
   plane (LDP Signaling) replaces I-component control plane throughout
   the MPLS core. This is raising an additional challenge related to
   blackhole avoidance in the I-component domain as described in this
   section. Figure 1 describes the case of a CE device (node A) dual-
   homed to two I-component instances located on two PBB-VPLS PEs (PE1
   and PE2).

                          +--------------+
         Figure 1: PBB Blackholing Issue - CE Dual-Homing use case


   The link between PE1 and CE A is active (marked with A) while the
   link between CE A and PE2 is in Standby/Blocked status. In the
   network diagram CMAC X is one of the MAC addresses located behind CE
   A in the customer domain, CMAC Y is behind CE B and the BVPLS
   instances on PE1 are associated with backbone MAC (BMAC) B1 and PE2
   with BMAC B2.

Internet-Draft  Extensions to LDP MAC Withdraw for PBB-VPLS  March 2010


   As the packets flow from CMAC X to CMAC Y through PE1 of BMAC B1, the
   remote PEs participating in the IVPLS (for example, PE3) will learn
   the CMAC X associated with BMAC B1 on PE1. Under failure of the link
   between CE A and PE1 and activation of link to PE2, the remote PEs
   (for example, PE3) will black-hole the traffic destined for customer
   MAC X to BMAC B1 until the aging timer expires or a packet flows from
   X to Y through the PE B2. This may take a long time (default aging
   timer is 5 minutes) and may affect a large number of flows across
   multiple I-components.

   A possible solution to this issue is to use the existing LDP MAC
   Flush as specified in [RFC4762] to flush in the BVPLS domain the BMAC
   associated with the PE where the failure occurred. This will
   automatically flush the CMAC to BMAC association in the remote PEs.
   This solution though has the disadvantage of producing a lot of
   unnecessary MAC flush in the B-VPLS domain as there was no failure or
   topology change affecting the Backbone domain.

   A better solution is required to propagate the I-component events
   through the backbone infrastructure (B-VPLS) in order to flush only
   the customer MAC to BMAC entries in the remote PBB-VPLS PEs. As there
   are no IVPLS control plane exchanges across the PBB backbone,
   extensions to B-VPLS control plane are required to propagate the I-
   component MAC Flush events across the B-VPLS.



4. Required Extensions to LDP MAC Withdraw

   The use of Address Withdraw message with MAC List TLV is proposed in
   [RFC4762] as a way to expedite removal of MAC addresses as the result
   of a topology change (e.g. failure of a primary link of a VPLS PE and
   implicitly the activation of an alternate link in a dual-homing use
   case). These existing procedures apply individually to B-VPLS and I-
   component domains.

   When it comes to reflecting topology changes in access networks
   connected to I-component across the B-VPLS domain certain additions
   should be considered as described below.

   MAC Switching in PBB is based on the mapping of Customer MACs (CMACs)
   to Backbone MAC(s) (BMACs). A topology change in the access (I-
   domain) should just invoke the flushing of CMAC entries in PBB PEs'
   FIB(s) associated with the I-component(s) impacted by the failure.
   There is a need to indicate the PBB PE (BMAC source) that originated
   the MAC Flush message.

Internet-Draft  Extensions to LDP MAC Withdraw for PBB-VPLS  March 2010


   These goals can be achieved by adding a new MAC Flush Parameters TLV
   in the LDP Address Withdraw message to indicate the particular
   domain(s) requiring MAC flush. At the other end, the receiving PEs
   may use the information from the new TLV to flush only the related
   FIB entry/entries in the I-component instance(s).

   A suggested structure for MAC Flush Parameters TLV is depicted below:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |1|1| MAC Flush Params TLV(TBD) |           Length              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Flags     | Sub-TLV Type  |         Sub-TLV Length        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                Sub-TLV Variable Length Value                  |
   |                             "                                 |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The UF bits are set to forward unknown so that potential intermediate
   VPLS PEs unaware of the new TLV can just propagate it transparently.
   The MAC Flush Parameters TLV type value is to be assigned by IANA.
   The Length field is used to define the length of the TLV including
   the type and the length itself. The TLV value field contains an one
   byte Flag field used as described below. A number of sub-TLVs may be
   also defined inside the TLV value field. Any sub-TLV definition to
   the above TLV MUST address the actions in combination with other
   existing sub-TLVs.

   The detailed format for the Flags bit vector is described below:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   |C|N|    MBZ    | (MBZ = MUST Be Zero)

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   1 Byte Flag field is mandatory. The following flags are defined:

     C flag, used to indicate whether the MAC Flush is required in the
     FIB associated with the VPLS context in which LDP MAC Flush was
     received. For PBB-VPLS this is called Backbone VPLS. C flag MUST be
     ZERO (C=0) when a MAC Flush for the Backbone VPLS (B-component
     VPLS) is required. C flag MUST be set (C=1) when the MAC Flush for
     Customer VPLS (I-component VPLS) is required.

Internet-Draft  Extensions to LDP MAC Withdraw for PBB-VPLS  March 2010


     N flag, used to indicate whether a positive (N=0, Flush-all-but-
     mine) or negative (N=1 Flush-all-from-me) MAC Flush is required.
     The source (mine/me) is defined either as the PW associated with
     the LDP session on which the LDP MAC Withdraw was received or with
     the BMAC(s) listed in the BMAC Sub-TLV.

     MBZ flags, the rest of the flags should be set to zero on
     transmission and ignored on reception.

   The following sub-TLVs MUST be included in the MAC Flush Parameters
   TLV if the C-flag is set:

   - PBB BMAC List sub-TLV:

   Type: 0x01

   Length: value length in octets. At least one BMAC address must be
   present in the list.

   Value: one or a list of 48 bits BMAC addresses. These are the source
   BMAC addresses associated with the B-VPLS instance that originated
   the MAC Withdraw message. It will be used to identify the CMAC(s)
   mapped to the BMAC(s) listed in the sub-TLV.

   - PBB ISID List sub-TLV:

   Type: 0x02,

   Length: value length in octets. Zero indicates an empty ISID list. An
   empty ISID list means that the flush applies to all the ISIDs mapped
   to the B-VPLS indicated by the FEC TLV.

   Value: one or a list of 24 bits ISIDs that represent the I-component
   FIB(s) where the MAC Flush needs to take place.

   The following steps describe the details of the processing for the
   related LDP Address Withdraw message:

   . The LDP MAC Withdraw Message, including the MAC Flush Parameters
     TLV is initiated by the PBB PE(s) experiencing a Topology Change
     event in one or multiple customer I-component(s).

          o The flags are set accordingly to indicate the type of MAC
             Flush required for this event: N=0 (Flush-all-but-mine),
             C=1 (Flush only CMAC FIBs).

          o The PBB Sub-TLVs (BMAC and ISID Lists) are included


Balus, et al.         Expires September 8, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Extensions to LDP MAC Withdraw for PBB-VPLS  March 2010


   . On reception of the LDP message, the B-VPLS instances related to
     the FEC TLV from the LDP Address Withdraw message must interpret
     the content of MAC Flush Parameters TLV. If the C-bit is set the
     BCBs should not flush their BMAC FIBs. The B-VPLS control plane
     may propagate the MAC Flush indication following the split-horizon
     grouping and the established BVPLS topology.

   . The receiving BEBs use the sub-TLVs from the MAC Flush Parameters
     TLV as follows:

          o  The PBB ISID List is used to determine the particular ISID
             FIBs that need to be flushed. If the ISID List is empty all
             the ISID FIBs associated with the receiving B-VPLS are
             flushed.

          o  The PBB BMAC List is used to identify from the ISID FIBs
             selected in the previous step just the entries that map
             CMACs to the BMACs that are not listed in the sub-TLV.

   .  Next, depending on the N flag value the following actions apply:

          o  N=0, all the CMACs in the selected ISID FIBs should be
             flushed with the exception of the resulted CMAC list
             ("Flush all but the CMACs associated with the BMAC(s) in
             the BMAC List Sub-TLV from the FIBs associated with the
             ISID list").

          o  N=1, the resulted CMAC list should be flushed ("Flush all
             the CMACs associated with the BMAC(s) in the BMAC List Sub-
             TLV from the FIBs associated with the ISID list")



5. Security Considerations

   No new security issues are introduced beyond those that are described
   in [RFC4762].



6. IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to assign MAC Flush Parameters TLV type values.

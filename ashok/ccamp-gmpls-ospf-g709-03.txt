Abstract

   As OTN network capabilities continue to evolve, there is an increased
   need to support GMPLS control for the same. [RFC4328] introduced
   GMPLS signaling extensions for supporting the early version of G.709
   [G.709-v1]. The basic routing considerations from signaling
   perspective is also specified in [RFC4328].

   The recent revision of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] and
   [GSUP.43] have introduced new ODU containers (both fixed and
   flexible) and additional ODU multiplexing capabilities, enabling
   support for optimal service aggregation.  

   This document describes OSPF protocol extensions to support
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) control for routing services over the
   standardized OTU/ODU containers in support of ODU based TDM
   switching. Routing support for Optical Channel Layer switching
   (Lambda switching) is not covered in this document.

1. Introduction

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends
   MPLS from supporting Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and
   switching to include support of four new classes of interfaces and
   switching: Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex (TDM),
   Lambda Switch (LSC), and Fiber-Switch (FSC) Capable.  A functional
   description of the extensions to MPLS signaling that are needed to
   support these new classes of interfaces and switching is provided in
   [RFC3471]. OSPF extensions for supporting GMPLS are defined in
   [RFC4203].

   ITU-T Recommendations G.709 and G.872 provide specifications for OTN
   interface and network architecture respectively. As OTN network
   capabilities continue to evolve; there is an increased need to  
   support GMPLS control for the same. 

   GMPLS signaling extensions to support G.709 OTN interfaces are   
   specified in [RFC4328]. The basic routing considerations from   
   signaling perspective is specified. G.709 specifications evolved  
   rapidly over the last few years. Following are the features added   
   in OTN since the first version [G.709-v1]. 

      (a) OTU Containers:  
          Pre-existing Containers: OTU1, OTU2 and OTU3
          New Containers introduced in [G.709-v3]: OTU2e and OTU4
          New Containers introduced in [GSUP.43]: OTU1e, OTU3e1 and OTU3e2           

      (b) Fixed ODU Containers:      
          Pre-existing Containers: ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 
          New Containers introduced in [G.709-v3]: ODU0, ODU2e and ODU4
          New Containers introduced in [GSUP.43]: ODU1e, ODU3e1 and ODU3e2

      (c) Flexible ODU Containers:
          ODUflex for CBR and GFP-F mapped services. ODUflex uses 'n' 
          number of OPU Tributary Slots where 'n' is different from the 
          number of OPU Tributary Slots used by the Fixed ODU Containers. 

      (d) Tributary Slot Granularity:
          OPU2 and OPU3 support two Tributary Slot Granularities: 
          (i) 1.25Gbps and (ii) 2.5Gbps. 

      (e) Multi-stage ODU Multiplexing:
          Multi-stage multiplexing of LO-ODUs into HO-ODU is supported. 
          Also, multiplexing could be heterogeneous (meaning LO-ODUs of
          different rates can be multiplexed into a HO-ODU).

      OTN networks support switching at two layers: (i) ODU Layer - TDM
 


Rajan Rao, et al.      Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  draft-ashok-ccamp-gmpls-ospf-g709-03.txt  March 14, 2011


      Switching and (ii) OCH Layer - Lambda (LSC) Switching. The nodes on 
      the network may support one or both the switching types. When 
      multiple switching types are supported MRN/MLN based routing
      [RFC5212] and [RFC6001] is assumed. 

      This document covers OSPF extensions to support routing over the 
      standardized OTU/ODU containers in support of ODU Layer based TDM 
      switching as outlined in the framework document [G.709-FRAME]. 
      The Interface Switch Capability Descriptor extensions for ODU Layer 
      switching and bandwidth representation for ODU containers are 
      defined in this document. 

      Routing support for Optical Channel Layer switching (LSC) is beyond 
      the scope of this document. Refer to [WSON-FRAME] for further 
      details. 


2. Conventions used in this document

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
      document is to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

      In addition, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the
      terminology used in ITU-T [G.709-v3], [G.872] and [GSUP.43], as 
      well as [RFC4201] and [RFC4203].  Abbreviations used in this 
      document is detailed in Appendix A.


3. OTU/ODU Link Representation 

      G.709 OTU/ODU Links are represented as TE-Links in GMPLS Traffic 
      Engineering Topology for supporting ODU layer switching. These 
      TE-Links can be modeled in multiple ways. Some of the prominent 
      representations are captured below. 

3.1. OTUk TE-Link

      OTUk Link can be modeled as a TE-Link. Switching at ODUk layer
      and ODUj layer (including multi-stage multiplexing) can be managed on 
      OTUk TE-Link. Figure-1 below provides an illustration of this link 
      type. 

      When a LO-ODU layer being switched on an OTUk interface involves 
      multi-stage multiplexing, all the HO-ODU layer(s) should 
      necessarily terminate between the same pair of nodes as the OTUk 
      layer in this case.  For example, if ODU1 layer switching is 
      configured on a OTU3 link via multiplexing hierarchy

      ODU3<-ODU2<-ODU1, HO-ODUs (namely ODU3 & ODU2) should terminate 
      between the same pair of nodes as OTU3 layer. 

        +-------+               +-------+               +-------+
        |  OTN  |               |  OTN  |               |  OTN  |
        |Switch |<- OTUk Link ->|Switch |<- OTUk Link ->|Switch |
        |   A   |               |   B   |               |   C   |
        +-------+               +-------+               +-------+

                |<-- TE-Link -->|       |<-- TE-Link -->|

                          Figure-1: OTUk TE-Link

3.2. ODUk TE-Link

      When ODUk layer does not terminate on the same pair of nodes 
      as OTUk layer, ODUk link should be modeled as a TE-Link. As 
      bandwidth is directly managed on the ODUk link, associated OTUk 
      links are not significant in this case. Switching at ODUj layer 
      (including multi-stage multiplexing) can be managed on ODUk TE-Link.
      Figure-2 below provides an illustration of this link type. 

      When a LO-ODU layer being switched on the ODUk interface involves 
      multi-stage multiplexing, all the HO-ODU layer(s) should necessarily 
      terminate between the same pair of nodes as ODUk in this case. For 
      example, if ODU1 layer switching is configured on an ODU3 link via   
      multiplexing hierarchy ODU3<-ODU2<-ODU1, HO-ODU (namely ODU2)
      should terminate between the same pair of nodes as ODU3. 

        +-------+               +-------+               +-------+
        |  OTN  |               |  OTN  |               |  OTN  |
        |Switch |<- OTUk Link ->|Switch |<- OTUk Link ->|Switch |
        |   A   |               |   B   |               |   C   |
        +-------+               +-------+               +-------+
                              ODUk Switched

                |<------------- ODUk Link ------------->|
                |<-------------- TE-Link--------------->|

                         Figure-2: ODUk TE-Link

3.3. ODUj TE-Link

      When a LO-ODUj within a HO-ODUk does not terminate on the same
      pair of nodes as HO-ODUk layer, Separate TE-Links needs to be 
      modeled for ODUk link and ODUj link. Also, ODUk link shall 
      no longer manage the bandwidth associated with the ODUj link. 
      Switching at sub-ODUj layer (including multi-stage multiplexing)

      can be supported on this ODUj TE-Link. Figure-3 below provides
      an illustration of this link type. 

      When a LO-ODU layer being switched on an ODUj interface involves 
      multi-stage multiplexing, all the HO-ODU layer(s) should necessarily 
      terminate between the same pair of nodes as ODUj in this case. For 
      example, if ODU0 layer switching is configured on an ODU2 link via   
      multiplexing hierarchy ODU2<-ODU1<-ODU0, HO-ODU (namely ODU1)
      should terminate between the same pair of nodes as ODU2. 

       +-----+             +-----+             +-----+             +-----+

                                 |<--------- ODUk Link ---------->|
                                 |<--------- TE-Link #1 --------->|

             |<-------------------- ODUj Link ------------------->|
             |<-------------------- TE-Link #2 ------------------>|

                         Figure-3: ODUj TE-Link


3.4. Bundled TE-Link 

      Any mix of OTU and ODU links of dissimilar rates that terminates on
      same pair of nodes and meets the entire bundling criterion specified in
      TE-Link Bundling specification [RFC4201] can be pulled together to 
      form a Bundle TE-Link. This is required for better scalability.


3.5. OTU/ODU Link Property Agreement

      The OTN interfaces (associated with peer nodes) participating in a 
      TE-Link may not be fully compatible in terms of OTN interface 
      properties.  The lowest common denominator between the two links 
      endpoints need to be used for forming the TE link. Some of OTN 
      specific link properties that need to be agreed upon between 
      the two link endpoints (on peer nodes) are:

      (a) OPU Tributary Slot Granularity for OPU2 and OPU3. 

      (b) Multiplexing hierarchies supported - both number of stages and
          specific LO-ODUs supported in each stage. This includes both
          Fixed and Flexible ODU containers.

Internet-Draft  draft-ashok-ccamp-gmpls-ospf-g709-03.txt  March 14, 2011


      These link properties either can be configured or discovered through
      Link discovery mechanism. The details of such mechanism is beyond the
      scope of this document.

4. OTU/ODU Link Bandwidth Model

      Bandwidth allocation/management on OTU/ODU links is done in terms 
      of discrete units called OPU Tributary Slots. OPU Tributary Slots 
      occurs in two granularities (1.25Gbps and 2.5Gbps) and the actual
      bit-rate of the OPU Tributary Slot slightly varies for different 
      ODU container types (i.e., ODU1, ODU2, ODU3 and ODU4). As a result 
      of this disparity, number of Tributary Slots required to map a 
      LO-ODU on different HO-ODU container types could vary. For example, 
      ODU2e requires 9 OPU TSs on ODU3 and 8 OPU TSs on ODU4. 

      The basic objectives of OTN interface bandwidth model are as 
      follows:

      (a) Support ODU multi-stage multiplexing hierarchy and yet not 
          require advertisement of complete hierarchy tree.

      (b) Account for bandwidth fragmentation that can result due to 
          the restricted multiplexing hierarchy supported on an OTN 
          interface. For example, assume that an ODU3 interface 
          supports direct multiplexing of ODU2 only. Here, mapping 
          of ODU1 and ODU0 is possible only through second stage 
          multiplexing underneath ODU2. If two ODU1 are created under 
          two different ODU2, only two ODU2 can be created further on
          the interface although 28 Tributary Slots (1.25Gbps) are 
          available on the interface (ODU hierarchy).

      (c) Hide the complexities in Tributary Slot Granularities (1.25Gbps 
          and 2.5Gbps) from bandwidth model and thereby simplify the 
          end-to-end path computation. As explained in the previous 
          section, this needs to be negotiated as a part of link 
          discovery or pre-configured locally on the either ends. 

      (d) Hide the complexities in Tributary Slot Size disparities (among
          ODU containers) and number of Tributary Slots required to map 
          a LO-ODU. This can be achieved by advertising the number of 
          LO-ODU containers that can be mapped on an OTN interface rather 
          than number of Tributary Slots or absolute bandwidth in 
          bytes/sec.

      (e) For ODU-Flex service, Absolute bandwidth required (for CBR 
          or GFP mapped service) needs to be mapped to 'n' Tributary 
          Slots of certain bit rate. This needs Tributary Slot bit-rate 
          and number of Tributary slots to be advertised.

5. OSPF TE-LSA Extension

      This section describes the OSPF TE-LSA Extensions to support 
      bandwidth encoding for OTU/ODU TE-Links. 

5.1. Maximum Bandwidth

      The format and interpretation of this attribute must be consistent
      with OSPF-TE Extension [RFC3630] and TE-Link Bundling Support 
      [RFC4201] specifications. The  OPUk payload nominal rate (in bytes 
      per sec) as specified in [G.709-v3] shall be encoded in this 
      attribute. 

5.2. Maximum Reservable Bandwidth 

      The format and interpretation of this attribute must be consistent
      with OSPF-TE Extension [RFC3630] and TE-Link Bundling Support 
      [RFC4201] specifications.   

5.3. Unreserved Bandwidth

      The format and interpretation of this attribute must be consistent
      with OSPF-TE Extension [RFC3630] and TE-Link Bundling Support 
      [RFC4201] specifications. 

      Unreserved Bandwidth in bytes per second is not of much value for
      OTU/ODU interfaces. Unreserved Bandwidth per ODU rate is more 
      appropriate and useful in this case. Implementations may choose to 
      ignore this attribute and consider per ODU-rate Unreserved Bandwidth 
      defined in Interface Switch Capability Descriptor for "G.709 ODUk" 
      encoding type. See section 5.4.1 for details.

5.4. Interface Switch Capability Descriptor

      The Interface Switching Capability Descriptor describes switching
      capability of an interface [RFC 4202]. This document defines a new
      Switching Capability value for OTN [G.709-v3] as follows:

   	Value       Type
      	-----       ----
   	250	    OTN-TDM capable (OTN-TDM)


      Nodes advertising ODUk switching BW for for its links must use  
      Switching Type and Encoding values as follows:

      	Switching Type = OTN-TDM
      	Encoding Type = G.709 ODUk (Digital Path) [as defined in RFC4328]

      Both fixed ODUk (where k=0,1,2,3,4,1e,2e) and flexible ODUs (ODUflex) 
      use same switching type and encoding values.

      When Swithcing Type and Encoding fields are set to values as stated
      above, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor should be 
      interpreted as follows:

         0                   1                   2                   3

      Maximum LSP Bandwidth

      This field should be encoded with Nominal Rate of the ODUj (j<= k) for
      which Bandwidth is advertised. The bandwidth unit is in bytes per second &
      the encoding is in IEEE floating point format [RFC 3471]. The discrete values
      for varous ODUj(s) is shown in the table below.

      For an unbundled link, the Maximum LSP Bandwidth at priority 'p' is set to
      Nominal rate of the ODUj for which bandwidth is advertised in Switch 
      Capability Specific Information (SCSI).

      For bundled link too, the Maximum LSP Bandwidth at priority 'p' is set to
      Nominal rate of the ODUj for which bandwidth is advertised in Switch 
      Capability Specific Information (SCSI).

       ODUflex        Any

       The Maximum LSP bandwidth field is used to identify the ODUj type.

5.4.1 ODU Switching

      When Switching Capability is set to OTN-TDM, it means the node is capable of

         - terminating OTUk layer
         - Switching of HO-ODU (ODUk)
         - switching of LO-ODU (ODUj) if HO-ODU supports mux/demux 
           (termination of HO-ODU is required for mux/demux operation)

      Multiple ISCDs would be advertised if an interface supports more than one
      type of ODUk switching. There would be one ISCD advertisement per ODUj
      independent of the OTN multiplexing branch it belongs to.

      For e.g. If an OTU3 interface supports ODU0, ODU1 and ODU2 switching, there
      would be three ISCDs one for each ODU type.

      Refer to examples in section 7.0.


5.4.2. ODUk Switch Capability Specific Information

   This SCSI field contains bandwidth information for fixed 
   ODUj(j=0,1,2,3,4,2e,1e) or ODUflex. 

   The type of ODUj/ODuflex is identified by Maximum LSP bandwidth field and
      BW sub TLV Type field as follows.

      If bandwidth advertisement is for fixed size ODUj, then
   	- set BW sub TLV Type = 1
   	- Encode nominal rate of the ODUj in Max LSP BW field
   	- Encode avaialble number of ODUj(s) as shown below

      If bandwidth advertisment is for ODUflex, then
   	- set BW sub TLV Type = 2
   	- Encode available BW in Max LSP BW field

      Available BW (in bytes/sec) is represented in IEEE float-point 
      format similar to Max-Lsp-Bandwidth in ISCD.

      The "Available BW" of  a bundled link at priority p is defined 
      to be the sum of "Available BW" at priority p of all of its 
      component links. 

   This information may be used to route LSPs over links which 
   have most bandwidth available.


5.5. Interface Multiplexing Capability Descriptor

   The OTN multiplexing hierarchy involves one or more ODU layers. The 
   server ODU layer is called the higher order ODU(HO-ODU) and the layer 
   multiplexed into a server ODU layer is called lower order ODU (LO-ODU).

Internet-Draft  draft-ashok-ccamp-gmpls-ospf-g709-03.txt  March 14, 2011


   A HO-ODU can carry (mux/demux) one or more LO-ODUs as specified in G.709. 
   Termination of HO-ODU is necessary to mux/demux LO-ODUs.  For e.g.

   a) on a OTU2 interface with OTU2-ODU2-ODU0 muxing stack, 
   it is necessary to terminate ODU2(H) in order to mux/demux 
   contained ODU0s.

   b) on a OTU2 interface with OTU2-ODU2-ODU1-ODU0 muxing stack,
     it is necessary to terminate ODU2 and ODU1 layers to mux/demux 
   contained ODU0s. 

   An OTN interface supporting multi-stage multiplexing requires termination 
   of more than one HO-ODU to access one or more LO-ODUs for switching purposes. 
   For e.g. on an interface with OTU3-ODU3-ODU2-ODU0 multiplexing stack/hierarchy,  
   ODU3 and ODU2 layers should be terminated to access ODU0s for switching purposes.

5.5.1 Multiplex Layers and Hierarchical LSP

   It is possible to construct H-LSP(s) using different HO-ODU muxing layer(s). 
   While creation of H-LSP is optional, it becomes necessary in network 
   scenarios where switching restrictions exist for LO-ODUs.

   Example #1:

    - Nodes A, B, D & E are ODU0 and ODU2 switching capable;  
    - Nodes C is ODU2 switching capable only.

    An ODU2-FA between nodes B & D is necessary to support E2E ODU0-LSP(s) 

   	 A-----B---------C--------D-----E

               <-----ODU2-FA------>
         <------------ODU0-LSP -------->

   Example #2: ODU0-LSP over G.709-v1 capable node (legacy node)

    - Nodes A, B, D & E are ODU0 & ODU1 switch capable nodes; 
    - Node C is ODU1 switching capable

    An ODU1-FA between nodes B & D is necessary to support E2E ODU0-LSPs


           A-----B---------C--------D-----E

                 <-----ODU1-FA------>
            <------------ODU0-LSP --------> 

   In order to support identification of potential FA boundary points, it is

   necessary to flood mux/demux information. This includes information about:

    - the HO-ODU layer which can be terminated
    - the LO-ODUs available upon HO-ODU termination (muxing hierarchy)

   The multiplexing hierarchy  provides information about
   specific branch(es) of the OTN muxing hierarchy. This includes

       - one or more HO-ODU(s) which needs to be terminated and
       - a LO-ODU layer which can be accessed after termination

   The HO-ODUs which are terminate-able are potential FA end points. 
   FA becomes necessary when switching bandwidth is not available at all 
   nodes along the path for an LSP (specifically for LSPs at LO-ODU layers).

   This draft proposes the use of IMCD (Interface Multiplexing Capability 
   Descriptor) to distribute OTN mux/demux information of Te-end points.

5.5.2 IMCD format

   The Interface Multiplexing Capability Descriptor (IMCD) describes 
   "Multiplexing" capability of an interface. It is a sub-TLV of the 
   Link TLV (Type TBD). The format of value field is as shown below:

5.5.2.1 G-PID

   The G-PID field is a 16 bit field as defined in [RFC3471].
   New G-PID values are defined in addition to those defined in [RFC3471]. 
   Within OTN context, the new G-PID values identify multiplexing stack 
   supported by the Te-end point.

   The table below shows newly defined values for G-PID:

5.5.2.2 Available Bandwidth

   The available bandwidth advertised in "Available HO-ODUj" field
   indicates the number of "Terminations" possible at HO-ODUj layer.
   The HO-ODUj layer (Parent ODU) is identified by G-PID field.

   This field (32 bits) indicates maximum number of Containers 
   of a given HO-ODUj at priority 'p' available on the TE-Link;  
   where {j=1,2,3,4}.

   The "Available HO-ODUj(s)" of  a bundled link at priority 'p' is
   defined to be the sum of "Available HO-ODUj(s)" at priority 'p' of all
   of its component links for that specific G-PID.

   Example#1: Unbundled link with ODU2-ODU0 muxing hierarchy support 


        A ---------- B

   IMCD advertised would be as follows:
      o G-PID= ODU2-ODU0
      o Available HO-ODUj count = 1 ( refers to ODU2 layer)

   The ODU2 termination implies ability to mux/demux 8xODU0s.

   Example#2: Bundled Te-link with ODU2-ODU0 muxing hierarchy support (3 links)

        A ========== B

   IMCD advertised would be as follows:
      o G-PID= ODU2-ODU0
      o Available HO-ODUj count = 3 (refers to ODU2 layer)

   The ODU2 termination implies ability to mux/demux 24xODU0s in total.

5.5.3 Controlling IMCD advertisement

   The IMCD advertisement is not mandatory and it is required only
   when FA support is needed.

Internet-Draft  draft-ashok-ccamp-gmpls-ospf-g709-03.txt  March 14, 2011


   The network operators can selectively enable IMCD advertisement 
   for specific HO-ODU mux layer(s). This can be done on a
   link by link basis, node basis or network basis. The mechanism
   to achieve this is outside the scope of this document.


5.5.4 How to use IMCDs for FA creation

   When computing path for an FA (induced or otherwise), the path 
   computing node should look for matching G-PIDs at the FA boundary nodes.
   For example, to create ODU1-FA for ODU0 service, the path computation 
   should look for matching G-PID = ODU1-ODU0 at nodes B & D 

   The need for FA is due to Node-C's ability to switch ODU1 only.


           A-----B---------C--------D-----E

                 <-----ODU1-FA------>
            <------------ODU0-LSP --------> 


5.5.5 IMCD and non OTN services

In certain deployments it may be beneficial to advertise ODU 
termination bandwidth without the LO-ODU information. The intent is to
allow signaling to decide non-OTN signal to adapt at the time 
of path establishment.

The G-PID values 96, 97, 98, 99 defined in section 5.5.2.1 are meant for 
this purpose. 

The path computation can also be preformed for specific clients over 
an ODUj using G-PID values 100, 101 & 102 (e.g. 10GBE mapping to 
ODU2 using GFP).

a) The ISCD advertisement by nodes A, B, C & D would be as follows

          ISCD1:

                    The IMCDs advertised for B-C would include the following:
                    IMCD1:
                      G-PID = ODU2-ODU1
                      Available HO-ODUj count at Pi = 2 (ODU2)

                    IMCD2:
                      G-PID = ODU1-ODU0
                      Available HO-ODUj count at Pi = 5 (ODU1)

                    IMCD3:
                      G-PID = ODU2-ODU1-ODU0
                      Available HO-ODUj count at Pi = 1 (ODU2)

In this example, we need two FAs to originate from the same point (at node-B).
It is necessary to advertise IMCD3 as we can not conclude full mux 
relation from IMCD1 & IMCD2.

7. Backward Compatibility 

If backwards compatibility is required with G.709-v1, then [RFC4328] 
based ISCDs should be a advertised in addition to ISCDs/IMCDs specified
in this document. 

8. Security Considerations

There are no additional security implications to OSPF routing
protocol due to the extensions captured in this document.

9. IANA Considerations

The memo introduces two new sub-TLVs of the Interface Switch Capability 
Descriptor Sub-TLV of TE-LSA. [RFC3630] says that the sub-TLVs of the
TE Link TLV in the range 10-32767 must be assigned by Expert Review,
and must be registered with IANA.

A.2 Terminology

      1. ODUk and ODUj

      ODUk refers to the ODU container that is directly mapped to an
      OTU container. ODUj refers to the lower order ODU container that 
      is mapped to an higher order ODU container via multiplexing. 

      2. LO-ODU and HO-ODU

      LO-ODU refers to the ODU client layer of lower rate that is mapped
      to an ODU server layer of higher rate via multiplexing. HO-ODU 
      refers to the ODU server layer of higher rate that supports 
      mapping of one or more ODU client layers of lower rate. 

      In multi-stage multiplexing case, a given ODU layer can be a
      client for one stage (interpreted as LO-ODU) and at the same

      time server for another stage (interpreted as HO-ODU). In this 
      case, the notion of LO-ODU and HO-ODU needs to be interpreted in a 
      recursive manner.

Appendix B : Optimization Techniques

   Optimization techniques can be used to reduce TE-LSA size. The following 
   sub sections describe available options.

B.1 Multiple ISCDs Vs. Single ISCD

   It is possible to encode ISCDs corresponding to different ODU layers
   into SCSI field of a single ISCD.  This options was shown in previous 
   version of this draft (draft-ashok-ccamp-gmpls-ospf-g709-02).

   Doing so will reduce the LSA size by a factor of:
      10 words x (#ODUjs - 1)

   It is possible to reduce LSA size further by reducing the size of BW field 
   to half word. Doing so will reduce LSA size by a factor of:
     4 words x (#ODUjs)

B.1 Multiple IMCDs Vs. Single IMCD

   This optimization doesn't save much.  The shrinking of BW field to 1/2 word 
   helps reduce LSA size to some extent. The size reduction depends on the number of ODUs supported.

      4 words x (#ODUjs)

B.1 Eight priorities Vs. restricted number of priorities

   It is possible to further optimize by advertising BW only for supported
   priorities. This can be easily achieved by having a bit vector as described 
   in previous version of this draft.

Appendix C: Relation with MLN & MRN

   The ISCD and IMCDs defined in this draft  doesn't repalce IACDs. 
   All three (ISCD, IMCD & IACD) can co-exist in a network and 
   serve different purposes.

Appendix D : AMP, BMP & GMP Mapping

   The G.709 defines various mapping schemes for LO-ODUs into HO-ODUs. 
   From G.709 descriptions, the AMP & GMP mapping appears to be fixed for 
   a given LO-ODU to HO-ODU based on the time slot granularity.  
   Since the mapping is fixed we do not see value in advertising this
   information in TE-LSAs.

Abstract

   As OTN network capabilities continue to evolve, there is an increased
   need to support GMPLS control for the same. [RFC4328] introduced
   GMPLS signaling extensions for supporting the early version of G.709
   [G.709-v1]. The basic routing considerations from signaling
   perspective is also specified in [RFC4328].

   The recent revision of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] and
   [GSUP.43] have introduced new ODU containers (both fixed and
   flexible) and additional ODU multiplexing capabilities, enabling
   support for optimal service aggregation.  

   This document describes OSPF protocol extensions to support
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) control for routing services over the
   standardized OTU/ODU containers in support of ODU based TDM
   switching. Routing support for Optical Channel Layer switching
   (Lambda switching) is not covered in this document.

1. Introduction

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends
   MPLS from supporting Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and
   switching to include support of four new classes of interfaces and
   switching: Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex (TDM),
   Lambda Switch (LSC), and Fiber-Switch (FSC) Capable.  A functional
   description of the extensions to MPLS signaling that are needed to
   support these new classes of interfaces and switching is provided in
   [RFC3471]. OSPF extensions for supporting GMPLS are defined in
   [RFC4203].

   ITU-T Recommendations G.709 and G.872 provide specifications for OTN
   interface and network architecture respectively. As OTN network
   capabilities continue to evolve; there is an increased need to  
   support GMPLS control for the same. 

   GMPLS signaling extensions to support G.709 OTN interfaces are   
   specified in [RFC4328]. The basic routing considerations from   
   signaling perspective is specified. G.709 specifications evolved  
   rapidly over the last few years. Following are the features added   
   in OTN since the first version [G.709-v1]. 

      (a) OTU Containers:  
          Pre-existing Containers: OTU1, OTU2 and OTU3
          New Containers introduced in [G.709-v3]: OTU2e and OTU4
          New Containers introduced in [GSUP.43]: OTU1e, OTU3e1 and OTU3e2           

      (b) Fixed ODU Containers:  

          Pre-existing Containers: ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 
          New Containers introduced in [G.709-v3]: ODU0, ODU2e and ODU4
          New Containers introduced in [GSUP.43]: ODU1e, ODU3e1 and ODU3e2

      (c) Flexible ODU Containers:
          ODUflex for CBR and GFP-F mapped services. ODUflex uses 'n' 
          number of OPU Tributary Slots where 'n' is different from the 
          number of OPU Tributary Slots used by the Fixed ODU Containers. 

      (d) Tributary Slot Granularity:
          OPU2 and OPU3 support two Tributary Slot Granularities: 
          (i) 1.25Gbps and (ii) 2.5Gbps. 

      (e) Multi-stage ODU Multiplexing:
          Multi-stage multiplexing of LO-ODUs into HO-ODU is supported. 
          Also, multiplexing could be heterogeneous (meaning LO-ODUs of
          different rates can be multiplexed into a HO-ODU).

      OTN networks support switching at two layers: (i) ODU Layer - TDM
      Switching and (ii) OCH Layer - Lambda (LSC) Switching. The nodes on 
      the network may support one or both the switching types. When 
      multiple switching types are supported MLN based routing [RFC5339] 
      is assumed. 

      This document covers OSPF extensions to support routing over the 
      standardized OTU/ODU containers in support of ODU Layer based TDM 
      switching as outlined in the framework document [G.709-FRAME]. 
      The Interface Switch Capability Descriptor extensions for ODU Layer 
      switching and bandwidth representation for ODU containers are defined 
      in this document. 

      Routing support for Optical Channel Layer switching (LSC) is beyond 
      the scope of this document. Refer to [WSON-FRAME] for further 
      details. 


2. Conventions used in this document

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
      document is to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

      In addition, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the
      terminology used in ITU-T [G.709-v3], [G.872] and [GSUP.43], as 
      well as [RFC4201] and [RFC4203].  Abbreviations used in this 
      document is detailed in Appendix A.


3. OTU/ODU Link Representation 

      G.709 OTU/ODU Links are represented as TE-Links in GMPLS Traffic 
      Engineering Topology for supporting ODU layer switching. These 
      TE-Links can be modeled in multiple ways. Some of the prominent 
      representations are captured below. 

3.1. OTUk TE-Link
      OTUk Link can be modeled as a TE-Link. Switching at ODUk layer
      and ODUj layer (including multi-stage multiplexing) can be managed on 
      OTUk TE-Link. Figure-1 below provides an illustration of this link 
      type. 

      When a LO-ODU layer being switched on an OTUk interface involves 
      multi-stage multiplexing, all the HO-ODU layer(s) should 
      necessarily terminate between the same pair of nodes as the OTUk 
      layer in this case.  For example, if ODU1 layer switching is 
      configured on a OTU3 link via multiplexing hierarchy

      ODU3<-ODU2<-ODU1, HO-ODUs (namely ODU3 & ODU2) should terminate 
      between the same pair of nodes as OTU3 layer. 

        +-------+               +-------+               +-------+
        |  OTN  |               |  OTN  |               |  OTN  |
        |Switch |<- OTUk Link ->|Switch |<- OTUk Link ->|Switch |
        |   A   |               |   B   |               |   C   |
        +-------+               +-------+               +-------+

                |<-- TE-Link -->|       |<-- TE-Link -->|

                          Figure-1: OTUk TE-Link

3.2. ODUk TE-Link
      When ODUk layer does not terminate on the same pair of nodes 
      as OTUk layer, ODUk link should be modeled as a TE-Link. As 
      bandwidth is directly managed on the ODUk link, associated OTUk 
      links are not significant in this case. Switching at ODUj layer 
      (including multi-stage multiplexing) can be managed on ODUk TE-Link.
      Figure-2 below provides an illustration of this link type. 

      When a LO-ODU layer being switched on the ODUk interface involves 
      multi-stage multiplexing, all the HO-ODU layer(s) should necessarily 
      terminate between the same pair of nodes as ODUk in this case. For 
      example, if ODU1 layer switching is configured on an ODU3 link via   
      multiplexing hierarchy ODU3<-ODU2<-ODU1, HO-ODU (namely ODU2)
      should terminate between the same pair of nodes as ODU3. 

        +-------+               +-------+               +-------+
        |  OTN  |               |  OTN  |               |  OTN  |
        |Switch |<- OTUk Link ->|Switch |<- OTUk Link ->|Switch |
        |   A   |               |   B   |               |   C   |
        +-------+               +-------+               +-------+
                              ODUk Switched

                |<------------- ODUk Link ------------->|
                |<-------------- TE-Link--------------->|

                         Figure-2: ODUk TE-Link

3.3. ODUj TE-Link
      When a LO-ODUj within a HO-ODUk does not terminate on the same
      pair of nodes as HO-ODUk layer, Separate TE-Links needs to be 
      modeled for ODUk link and ODUj link. Also, ODUk link shall 
      no longer manage the bandwidth associated with the ODUj link. 
      Switching at sub-ODUj layer (including multi-stage multiplexing) 
      can be supported on this ODUj TE-Link. Figure-3 below provides
      an illustration of this link type.

      When a LO-ODU layer being switched on an ODUj interface involves 
      multi-stage multiplexing, all the HO-ODU layer(s) should necessarily 
      terminate between the same pair of nodes as ODUj in this case. For 
      example, if ODU0 layer switching is configured on an ODU2 link via   
      multiplexing hierarchy ODU2<-ODU1<-ODU0, HO-ODU (namely ODU1)
      should terminate between the same pair of nodes as ODU2.

                                 |<--------- ODUk Link ---------->|
                                 |<--------- TE-Link #1 --------->|

             |<-------------------- ODUj Link ------------------->|
             |<-------------------- TE-Link #2 ------------------>|

                         Figure-3: ODUj TE-Link


3.4. Bundled TE-Link  
      Any mix of OTU and ODU links of dissimilar rates that terminates on
      same pair of nodes and meets the entire bundling criterion specified in
      TE-Link Bundling specification [RFC4201] can be pulled together to 
      form a Bundle TE-Link. This is required for better scalability.

3.5. OTU/ODU Link Property Agreement

      The OTN interfaces (associated with peer nodes) participating in a 
      TE-Link may not be fully compatible in terms of OTN interface 
      properties.  The lowest common denominator between the two links 
      endpoints need to be used for forming the TE link. Some of OTN 
      specific link properties that need to be agreed upon between 
      the two link endpoints (on peer nodes) are:

      (a) OPU Tributary Slot Granularity for OPU2 and OPU3. 

      (b) Multiplexing hierarchies supported - both number of stages and
          specific LO-ODUs supported in each stage. This includes both
          Fixed and Flexible ODU containers. 

      These link properties either can be configured or discovered through
      Link discovery mechanism. The details of such mechanism is beyond the
      scope of this document.

4. OTU/ODU Link Bandwidth Model

      Bandwidth allocation/management on OTU/ODU links is done in terms 
      of discrete units called OPU Tributary Slots. OPU Tributary Slots 
      occurs in two granularities (1.25Gbps and 2.5Gbps) and the actual
      bit-rate of the OPU Tributary Slot slightly varies for different 
      ODU container types (i.e., ODU1, ODU2, ODU3 and ODU4). As a result 
      of this disparity, number of Tributary Slots required to map a 
      LO-ODU on different HO-ODU container types could vary. For example, 
      ODU2e requires 9 OPU TSs on ODU3 and 8 OPU TSs on ODU4. 

      The basic objectives of OTN interface bandwidth model are as 
      follows:

      (a) Support ODU multi-stage multiplexing hierarchy and yet not 
          require advertisement of complete hierarchy tree.

      (b) Account for bandwidth fragmentation that can result due to 
          the restricted multiplexing hierarchy supported on an OTN 
          interface. For example, assume that an ODU3 interface 
          supports direct multiplexing of ODU2 only. Here, mapping 
          of ODU1 and ODU0 is possible only through second stage 
          multiplexing underneath ODU2. If two ODU1 are created under 
          two different ODU2, only two ODU2 can be created further on
          the interface although 28 Tributary Slots (1.25Gbps) are 
          available on the interface (ODU hierarchy).

      (c) Hide the complexities in Tributary Slot Granularities (1.25Gbps 
          and 2.5Gbps) from bandwidth model and thereby simplify the 
          end-to-end path computation. As explained in the previous 
          section, this needs to be negotiated as a part of link 
          discovery or pre-configured locally on the either ends. 

      (d) Hide the complexities in Tributary Slot Size disparities (among
          ODU containers) and number of Tributary Slots required to map 
          a LO-ODU. This can be achieved by advertising the number of 
          LO-ODU containers that can be mapped on an OTN interface rather 
          than number of Tributary Slots or absolute bandwidth in 
          bytes/sec.

      (e) For ODU-Flex service, Absolute bandwidth required (for CBR 
          or GFP mapped service) needs to be mapped to 'n' Tributary 
          Slots of certain bit rate. This needs Tributary Slot bit-rate 
          and number of Tributary slots to be advertised.

      bandwidth encoding for OTU/ODU TE-Links. 

5.1. Maximum Bandwidth

      The format and interpretation of this attribute must be consistent
      with OSPF-TE Extension [RFC3630] and TE-Link Bundling Support 
      [RFC4201] specifications. The  OPUk payload nominal rate (in bytes 
      per sec) as specified in [G.709-v3] shall be encoded in this 
      attribute. 

5.2. Maximum Reservable Bandwidth 

      The format and interpretation of this attribute must be consistent
      with OSPF-TE Extension [RFC3630] and TE-Link Bundling Support 
      [RFC4201] specifications.   

5.3. Unreserved Bandwidth

      The format and interpretation of this attribute must be consistent
      with OSPF-TE Extension [RFC3630] and TE-Link Bundling Support 
      [RFC4201] specifications. 

      Unreserved Bandwidth in bytes per second is not of much value for
      OTU/ODU interfaces. Unreserved Bandwidth per ODU rate is more 
      appropriate and useful in this case. Implementations may choose to 
      ignore this attribute and consider per ODU-rate Unreserved Bandwidth 
      defined in Interface Switch Capability Descriptor for "G.709 ODUk" 
      encoding type. See section 5.4.2.

5.4. Interface Switch Capability Descriptor

      As specified in GMPLS Signaling Extensions for OTN [RFC4238], 
      following are the Switching and Encoding Types that needs to be 
      used for OTU/ODU interface supporting ODU switching. 

      Switching Type = TDM  [defined in RFC3471]
      Encoding Type = G.709 ODUk (Digital Path) [defined in RFC4328]

      Interface Switching Capability Descriptor for TDM is defined in 
      [RFC4203]. The current definition needs to be extended to cover the 
      bandwidth specification for ODU layer(s). When Encoding Type is 
      "G.709 ODUk", Interface switching Capability Descriptor should be 
      interpreted as follows:

      Max LSP Bandwidth

      Format and interpretation of this attribute must be consistent with
      specification in GMPLS Routing Extension [RFC4202] and TE-Link 
      Bundling Support [RFC4201].  

      For ODU Encoding type, this should be coded with maximum bandwidth 
      (in bytes per second) available on a single ODU container for 
      ODUflex service. If OTU/ODU interface is composed of multiple ODU 
      containers (through multi-stage multiplexing), the ODU container with
      highest capacity available for ODUflex shall be chosen for encoding 
      this attribute. If the interface does not support ODU-flex service, 
      this value should be coded as zero. 

      Encoding of Max LSP Bandwidth is as follows:

      Max LSP Bandwidth = Unreserved-TS-Count x TS-Nominal-Rate

      where,
      Unreserved-TS-Count: Number OPU Tributary Slots available on the

      TS-Nominal-Rate: Nominal rate of an OPU Trib Slot on the ODU 
                       Container in Bytes per second.

      When link bundling is involved, the interpretation of this attribute
      must be consistent with TE-Link Bundling Support [RFC4201]. 

5.4.1. TDM - Switch Capability Specific Information

      The format and interpretation of TDM - Switch Capability Specific 
      Information must be as per OSPF GMPLS Extension [RFC4203].

      Minimum LSP Bandwidth

      This attribute needs to be used in conjunction with Max LSP 
      Bandwidth.  Nominal rate of OPU Tributary Slot in bytes per second 
      should be coded in this attribute such that following relationship 
      holds good.

      Indication

      This attribute is not applicable for this encoding type. 

      It is important to note that Padding bytes defined in [RFC4203] 
      should be interpreted as "Reserved". That means - TLV length of 
      Interface Switch Capability Descriptor includes these bytes as well. 

5.4.2. ODUk Switch Capability Specific Information

      This is the new sub-TLV added for supporting ODUk switching. This 
      must be included when encoding type is "G.709 ODUk". TLV type of 
      ODUk-SCSI-TLV shall be coded as 1. This Sub-TLV should contain one 
      or more PER-SIGNALTYPE-BW-TLV sub-TLV(s).

      Optimization Note:
      It is possible to optimize this bandwidth information by including
      the available bandwidth for the supported priority levels only. A 
      bitmap (8 bits) can be added in place of  reserved bytes to 
      indicate the priority values(8) for which available bandwidth is 
      advertised.  

5.4.2.1. Signal Type

      This field (8 bits) must be coded as specified in OTN Signaling
      Extension [RFC4238]. The values defined in [RFC4238] pertains to
      [G.709-v1]. This needs to be extended to support additional ODU

      containers defined in more recent G.709 specifications [G.709-v3].

        13      ODU3e1 (40Gbps Ethernet [GSUP.43])

        42      ODU2_ANY (ODU2, ODU1e, ODU2e and future 10Gbps ODU variants)
        43      ODU3_ANY (ODU3, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and future 40Gbps ODU variants)
        44      ODU4_ANY (ODU4 and future 100Gbps ODU variants)
        45-255  Reserved (for future)

       Signal Types 40 to 44 can be used for further optimizing the bandwidth
       encoding by advertising a single bandwidth entry for all the ODU types
       (of almost same rate) switchable on a given interface.  For instance, 
       assume an OTU interface that can be configured as OTU2 or OTU2e or 
       OTU1e. Though the interface can potentially switch ODU2 or ODU2e or 
       ODU1e, it is wasteful to advertise separate PER-SIGNALTYPE-BW-TLV for 
       each ODU2 variants namely ODU1e, ODU2e and ODU2. In such cases, ODU2_ANY 
       can be used. It is important to note that when ODUj_ANY bandwidth entry 
       is included, no separate bandwidth entry for individual ODUj variants 
       must be present. The route computation engine should treat ODUj_ANY as 
       a wildcard entry for all the ODUj variants of the same rate. 

5.4.2.2. Bandwidth Type

      This field (4 bits) indicates the bandwidth (BW) type pertaining to 
      "Available ODUs" field. The values supported are as follows:

      Value     Type
      -----     ----
        0       Max LSP Bandwidth
        1       Unreserved Bandwidth 
        2-15    Reserved (for future)

5.4.2.3. Flags

      This field (4 bits) should be interpreted as a bitmap. The bits are
      reserved for future use. This should be coded as 0x0. The receiving
      node should discard this field.

5.4.2.4. Available ODUs   

      This field (16 bits) indicates the maximum number of ODU Containers
      of a given Signal-Type available on this TE-Link.

      When Bw-Type (=0) is "Max-Lsp-Bandwidth", The "Available ODUs" of a 
      bundled link at priority p is defined to be the maximum of the 
      "Available ODUs" at priority p of all of its component links. 

      When Bw-Type (=1) is "Unreserved-Bandwidth", The "Available ODUs" of a 
      bundled link at priority p is defined to be the sum of the 
      "Available ODUs" at priority p of all of its component links. 

      Bw-Type of 1 (Unreserved Bandwidth) is not applicable when there is 
      no link bundling.

6. Use Cases   
       This sections presents some use-cases for bandwidth encoding
       and usage. 
6.1. Links supporting line rate service only   

       Assume OTU2 interface that supports ODU2 switching only. Interface
       Switching Capability Descriptor should be coded as follows:

       Max Lsp Bw = 0                  // ODUflex is not supported. 
       Min Lsp Bw = (1,249,409 / 8)    // Nominal rate of OPU2 TS in bytes
                                       // per second.

       +---------------+----------------+---------------------------+
6.2. Multi-stage multiplexing

       Assume OTU3 interface that supports switching at line rate ODU3 
       and lower rates - ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e & ODUflex via 
       multiplexing.

       Max Lsp Bw = (32 * Min Lsp Bw)     // BW for ODUflex (on ODU3)
       Min Lsp Bw = (1,254,703 / 8)       // Nominal rate of OPU3 TS in 
                                          // bytes per second.

       Note that ODUflex bandwidth is encoded in ISCD itself, so it is 
       not advertised in "ODUk Switching Capability Specific 
       Information".

6.3. Link bundle with dissimilar OTU/ODU interfaces

       Assume a link bundle involving OTU3, OTU2 and OTU2e interfaces 
       that support switching at all standard LO-ODUs. 

       Max Lsp Bw = (32 * Min Lsp Bw)     // BW for ODUflex (on ODU3)
       Min Lsp Bw = (1,254,703 / 8)       // OPU3 TS Size in bytes per

       Note that ODUflex bandwidth is encoded in ISCD itself, so it is 
       not advertised in "ODUk Switching Capability Specific 
       Information". 



7. Security Considerations

      There are no additional security implications to OSPF routing
      protocol due to the extensions captured in this document.



8. IANA Considerations
      The memo introduces two new sub-TLVs of the Interface Switch 
      Capability Descriptor Sub-TLV of TE-LSA. [RFC3630] says that the 
      sub-TLVs of the TE Link TLV in the range 10-32767 must be assigned 
      by Expert Review, and must be registered with IANA.

      The memo has two suggested values for the two sub-TLVs of the 
      Interface Switch Capability Descriptor Sub-TLV; it is strongly 
      recommended that the suggested values be granted, as there are 
      interoperable implementations using these values.

   B. Terminology

      1. ODUk and ODUj

      ODUk refers to the ODU container that is directly mapped to an
      OTU container. ODUj refers to the lower order ODU container that 
      is mapped to an higher order ODU container via multiplexing. 

      2. LO-ODU and HO-ODU

      LO-ODU refers to the ODU client layer of lower rate that is mapped
      to an ODU server layer of higher rate via multiplexing. HO-ODU 
      refers to the ODU server layer of higher rate that supports 
      mapping of one or more ODU client layers of lower rate. 

      In multi-stage multiplexing case, a given ODU layer can be a
      client for one stage (interpreted as LO-ODU) and at the same 
      time server for another stage (interpreted as HO-ODU). In this 
      case, the notion of LO-ODU and HO-ODU needs to be interpreted in a 
      recursive manner.

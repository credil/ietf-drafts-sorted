   This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for
   SONET/SDH that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD
   sub-TLV and has been designed to be consistent with the work on
   Technology Agnostic OSPF Traffic Engineering Extensions for 
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [BA-TLV].

1.  Introduction

   The ITU-T defines the architecture of the Automatically Switched
   Optical Network (ASON) in [G.8080].

   [RFC4258] details the routing requirements for the GMPLS suite of
   routing protocols to support the capabilities and functionality of
   ASON control planes identified in [G.7715] and in [G.7715.1].

   [RFC4652] evaluates the IETF Link State Routing Protocols against the
   requirements identified in [RFC4258]. Section 7.1 of [RFC4652]
   summarizes the capabilities to be provided by OSPFv2 [RFC2328] in
   support of ASON routing. [RFC5787] is an Experimental RFC that
   defines extensions to OSPFv2 to support these requirements.  It
   notes that the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor may 
   be included for each layer of a multi-layer link [RFC4202] to meet
   ASON needs.  However, for some types SONET/SDH links there can be
   several data plane layers supported by a single link, and as a 
   result a need to carry several copies of the ISCD.

   This draft defines the application of the Bandwidth Accounting 
   sub-TLV defined in [BA-TLV] for SONET/SDH,
   to address the issues identified above.


2.  Optimization of bandwidth advertisement for SONET/SDH

2.1 Requirements for Multi-layer SONET/SDH Links

   [RFC4652] notes that in the ASON context, bandwidth accounting 
   representations are possible, taking the form of a set of tuples 
   <signal_type; number of unallocated timeslots>, and that this    
   representation may also require definition of additional signal 
   types (from those defined in [RFC4606]) to represent support of
   contiguously concatenated signals,
   i.e., STS-(3xN)c SPE / VC-4-Nc, N = 4, 16, 64, 256.

   It notes that the ISCD defined in [RFC4202] can be used to
   support ASON without requiring any bandwidth accounting 
   change from an LSR perspective.  However, the ISCD defined
   in [RFC4202} must be advertised once per signal type 
   (identified by the Minimum Reservable Bandwidth value) in
   order to provide an accurate advertisement of bandwidth
   for each signal.  For SONET/SDH links, it is common to support
   4-5 signal types (e.g., STS-1, 3c, 12c, 48c and 192c) at once,

   and advertisement of 4-5 ISCD sub-TLVs would consume about
   200 bytes as compared to 20-30 bytes for a tuple format.

   Most of the ISCD bytes are required to advertise 8 levels of 
   priority.  We believe this overhead can be reduced as (a) ASON
   specifications do not identify priority as an ASON service; and
   (b) TDM networks generally to not support preemption priority 
   and do not require 8 levels of priority.


2.2.  Bandwidth Accounting Sub-TLV for SONET/SDH

   [BA-TLV] defines a Bandwidth
   Accounting Sub-TLV that can be used to carry SONET/SDH bandwidth 
   availability at multiple link component signal
   types as supplementary information to the ISCD sub-TLV.   

   When multiple SONET/SDH signal types are advertised, a single ISCD
   is given for the smallest bandwidth signal type and the BA sub-TLV 
   is also advertised to provide compact bandwidth availability 
   advertisement for all signal types.  

   The type used for the sub-TLV is TBD.

   [BA-TLV] defines this format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   For SONET/SDH networks, the Switching Capability field and the
   Encoding field MUST take the following values: Switching
   Capability (8 bits)=100 (TDM).  Encoding (8 bits)=5 (Sonet/SDH).  

   If no priority is supported, just the 0 priority MUST be advertised.

   Service Type (8 bits) takes values as below for 
   SONET/SDH Signal Type:

   Value  Type (Elementary Signal)
   -----  ------------------------
    TBD   STS-1 SPE / VC-3 
    TBD   STS-3c SPE / VC-4 
    TBD   STS-12c SPE/VC-4-4c 
    TBD   STS-48c SPE/VC-4-16c 
    TBD   STS-192c SPE/VC-4-64c 

   Bandwidth (32 bits) is used to specify the number of identical 
   unallocated timeslots per Service
   Type and per TE Link.  As such, the initial value(s) of this TLV
   indicates the total capacity in terms of number of timeslots per TE
   link.  The service type included in the BW sub-TLV is specific to
   the layer link being reported and is not derived from some other
   signal type (e.g.  STS-48c is not announced as 16 x STS-3c).

   For instance on an OC-192/STM-64 interface the bandwidth for
   service type STS-3c SPE/VC-4 may be initially equal to 64, and
   the bandwidth for service type STS-48c SPE/VC-4-16c may be equal to
   4 depending on the interface capabilities.  Once one timeslot is
   occupied by being allocated for a connection at the same or a larger
   service type or being blocked due to the allocation of part of
   the timeslot for a connection at a smaller service type, the 
   bandwidth is decreased by the number of timeslots
   this connection implies.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will allocate codepoints for the Service Type of the
   Bandwidth Availability sub-TLV for SONET/SDH from the
   standard range.  Five Service Type values are requested.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an optimization for SONET/SDH link bandwidth
   advertisement consistent with the requirements in [RFC4258] and 
   [RFC4652].  No additional security issues are identified.

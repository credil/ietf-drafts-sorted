               RADIUS attributes for IPv6 Access Networks
               draft-lourdelet-radext-ipv6-access-02.txt

Abstract

   IPv6 nodes can have configuration information provided to them using
   DHCPv6 and/or Router Advertisements.  This document specifies RADIUS
   attributes that complement RFC3162 for use with DHCPv6 and/or Router
   Advertisements (SLAAC) for use in network access scenarios.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access              December 2009


1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   This document specifies new IPv6 RADIUS attributes used to support
   IPv6 network access.  As IPv6 specifies two configuration mechanisms
   (DHCP and SLAAC) the attributes defined in this document may apply to
   DHCPv6, SLAAC or both with the new attributes are targeted at both
   protocols when it makes sense.  The RADIUS attributes defined in
   [RFC3162]and [RFC4818] do not define methods for assignment of IPv6
   addresses to hosts (via DHCPv6) or IPv6 recursive DNS servers (via
   DHCPv6 or [[RFC5006]), nor the passing of route prefix info (via
   [RFC4191].  The Radius options to do so are the subject of this
   draft.


3.  Deployment Scenarios

3.1.  IPv6 Address Assignment

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign one or more or non-
   temporary IPv6 addresses to nodes.  In IPv6, both SLAAC and DHCPv6
   can be used for address assignment.  While SLAAC provides a host with
   a /64 IPv6 prefix from which to construct its address, the host is
   free to construct a 64-bit Interface ID that when concatenated with
   the /64 prefix provides a unique address.  By providing a host only a
   /64 network operators are unaware of the exact IP addresses in use by
   a device.  To contrast SLAAC, DHCPv6 requires a host explicitly
   request non-temporary addresses from a DHCPv6 server permitting an
   operator control over address assignment.  This document specifies a
   new RADIUS attribute for the assignment of non-temporary IPv6
   addresses to a host via DHCPv6.  Other DHCPv6 parameters such as
   preferred and valid address lifetimes are provided for by the NAS and
   not through RADIUS attributes.  As a DHCPv6 client may request an
   address at any time, a RADIUS server may be required to service
   additional RADIUS Access-Requests for a single network access
   session.

3.2.  Recursive DNS Servers

   DHCPv6 provides an option for recursive DNS servers to hosts, as does
   a Router Advertisement supporting the experimental [RFC5006].
   Existing DHCPv4 options only convey DNS as 32-bit IPv4 addresses and



Lourdelet, et al.         Expires June 20, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access              December 2009


   cannot support a 128-bit IPv6 address.  In the current RADIUS
   specifications there are no IETF/IANA defined attributes for
   recursive DNS and many NAS implement vendor specific attributes
   (e.g.: Ascend-Primary-DNS).  In some operator environments a network
   access session may be configured with a specific set of one or more
   recursive DNS.  This document specifies a new RADIUS attribute to
   convey a list of IPv6 addresses that can be used for a host for
   domain name service.  Best current practice is to configure hosts
   with more than one recursive domain name server, this is achieved in
   the RADIUS environment by returning multiple IPv6-DNS-Server-Address
   options within an Access-Accept.  The NAS shall use the addresses
   returned in the RADIUS IPv6-DNS-Server-Address attribute for the
   DHCPv6 DNS-Servers option [RFC3646], the Router Advertisement
   Recursive DNS Server Option [RFC5006], or both.

3.3.  IPv6 Route Information

   In scenarios where Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   [RFC4862] is used for address assignment, a Router Advertisement is
   multicast with one or more Prefix Information Options with the
   autonomous-bit set to true.  A Prefix Information Option, when used
   for SLAAC, is a /64 prefix to which a host appends its locally-
   generated Interface Id to create a unique 128-bit IPv6 address.
   [RFC3162] currently defines a Framed-IPv6-Prefix which can be used by
   a NAS to advertise on-link prefixes in a Router Advertisement Prefix
   Information Option [RFC4861].  The IPv6 Route Information attribute
   is almost the inverse; it is intended to be used to instruct a host
   connected to the NAS that a specific route is reachable via the NAS/
   router.  [RFC4191] defines an ICMPv6 Route Information Option for
   this purpose, ie to convey route information from a router to a host.
   The Route Information Option is used in environments where multiple
   advertising routers are present.  It directs a host to which router
   each specific route should be the next-hop to.  For each IPv6-Prefix-
   Information attribute, the NAS may advertise a unique [RFC4191] Route
   Information Option.


4.  Attributes

   The fields shown in the diagrams below are transmitted from left to
   right.

4.1.  Framed-IPv6-Address

   This Attribute indicates an IPv6 Address that is assigned to the
   uplink NAS-facing interface of the user equipment.  It MAY be used in
   Access-Accept packets, and can appear multiple times.  It MAY be used
   in an Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access              December 2009


   it would prefer these IPv6 address(es), but the server is not
   required to honor the hint.  Since it is assumed that the NAS, when
   necessary, will add a route corresponding to the address it is not
   necessary for the server to also send a host Framed-IPv6-Route
   attribute for the same address.

   This Attribute can be used by DHCPv6 to offer a unique IPv6 address
   or can be used for a-posteriori validation or announcment of an
   autoconfigured address.

   A summary of the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute format is shown below.

   Advertisement as specified in [RFC5006] or mapped to the matching
   DHCPv6 option.

5.  Diameter Considerations

   Since the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from the
   standard RADIUS type space (see Section 7), no special handling is
   required by Diameter entities.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the use of RADIUS for the purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting in IPv6-enabled
   networks.  In such networks, the RADIUS protocol may run either over
   IPv4 or over IPv6.  Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS
   protocol apply to the attributes defined in this document.  Since
   IPSEC is natively defined for IPv6, it is expected that running
   RADIUS implementations supporting IPv6 may want to run over IPSEC.
   Where RADIUS is run over IPSEC and where certificates are used for
   authentication, it may be desirable to avoid management of RADIUS
   shared secrets, so as to leverage the improved scalability of public
   key infrastructure.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the assignment of three new RADIUS Attribute
   Types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following
   attributes:

   o  Framed-IPv6-Address

   o  IPv6-DNS-Server-Address

   o  IPv6-Prefix-Information

   IANA should allocate these numbers from the standard RADIUS
   Attributes space using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].

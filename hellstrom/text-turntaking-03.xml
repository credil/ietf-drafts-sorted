      <t>This memo defines a new Media Feature Tag "real-time-text" for use in
      SIP registration and session establishment. This is used to indicate if
      a device capable of text communication has full real-time text
      capabilities or limitations in its capabilities requiring the users to
      apply some turn-taking habits.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>Media feature tags for use in SIP headers are introduced in RFC 3840
      <xref target="RFC3840"></xref>. They are used with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).</t>

      <t>When negotiating a text communication medium in a session, a user may
      find it very desirable to achieve a text communication path with
      real-time text capabilities. In order to support routing of negotiating
      to support this preference, an indication in a SIP media-feature tag can
      be used. That media-feature tag is defined in this specification. One
      value is given to the parameter for indication of full simultaneous two
      way capabilities of the text communication.</t>

      <t>When interworking with legacy telecommunication devices through a
      gateway, an IP based text phone using SIP may be required to limit its
      capabilities to match those devices. For example, V.21 based textphones
      are full duplex in transport, but have varying handling of the
      presentation. Some types merge the two sources in one window. Some have
      a kind of irc-like display with labels in front of the text from
      different participants. And yet some do a split in two windows of
      real-time text from each direction.</t>

      <t>In order for a SIP-based text capable device to display an
      appropriate user interface when interacting with one of these legacy
      devices, it is necessary to convey a parameter indicating the limited
      capability of the legacy device. It is also of interest to route calls
      to the most capable device.</t>

      <t>When it is interacting with a legacy device, an IP text capable device may
      receive an offer that contains the 'real-time-text' tag indicating some
      restriction. That tag then acts as a cue to configure the user interface
      appropriately, although there is nothing in the generated answer to
      indicate that this has been done. Similiarly, if an answer is received
      that contains a 'real-time-text' tag with a value indicating restrictions,
      that indicates that the remote
      device has limited capabilities regarding simulaneity, and the user-interface should present
      some indication of this to the user.</t>

      <t>More information on handling of real-time text is found in
      <xref target="RFC5194">RFC 5194. Framework for real-time text over IP
      using the Session Initiation Protocol</xref>. This memo defines such a
      parameter.</t>

      <t>This specification defines a Media Feature tag 'real-time-text'. Its
      formatting in SIP headers is described in the following:</t>

      <!--<list style="empty">-->

      <t>Media Feature Tag name: sip.real-time-text</t>

      <t>ASN.1 Identifier: y.y.</t>

      <t>Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag: The
      sip.real-time-text media feature tag indicates whether a communications
      device can simultaneously handle the real-time text medium and audio in
      its user interface or towards attached devices, or if limitations must
      be applied by users who communicate with the device.</t>

      <t>Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: Token with an
      equality relationship.</t>

      <t>Defined values are: <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="full:">The device can handle real-time text
          simultaneously in both directions and if it supports audio, audio
          and text can also be handled simultaneously. (default)</t>

          <t hangText="restricted:">The device requires some
          ordered turn-taking to take place. It is not specified how strict
          this turntaking must be, and it is left to the users to figure out
          what level of turntaking signaling is needed.</t>


        </list></t>

      <!--<list style="empty">-->

      <t>The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
      applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: This
      feature tag is most useful in a communications application for
      describing the capabilities of a SIP multimedia communication device,
      SIP application servers implementing services including real-time text,
      or a PSTN textphone gateway, connecting SIP devices with legacy
      textphones, with the intention both to support routing of the call and
      indication to the SIP device user if turntaking must be applied.</t>

      <t>Examples of typical use: Choosing to communicate with a native,
      real-time text capable device rather than a legacy textphone behind a
      gateway, when a selection is possible. Instruct the user of the SIP
      device about the need to apply turntaking habits as used with legacy
      textphones when the call is made through a gateway with that kind of
      device.</t>

      <t>Related standards or documents: RFC XXXX.</t>

      <t>Security Considerations: Security considerations for this media
      feature tag are discussed in Section 11.1 of RFC 3840.</t>

IKEv2 Redirect based Authentication Offload and Proxy Session Resumption
          draft-padmakumar-ikev2-redirect-and-auth-offload-02

Abstract

   IKEv2 supports multiple authentication mechanisms like public key
   signatures, shared secrets and EAP.  EAP based authentication
   requires server to maintain information about the client until EAP
   completes.  Public key based authentication mechanisms are highly
   computational intensive and demands server CPU resources.

   Redirect Mechanism for IKEv2 proposes a mechanism for IKEv2 that
   enables a VPN gateway to redirect the VPN client to another VPN
   gateway, for example, based on the load condition.

   IKEv2 Session Resumption proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a
   client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient
   manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA.

   Redirect mechanism can also be used to redirect a client to another
   router (trust anchor) to do mutual authentication and an optional
   proxy session negotiation on behalf of the server.  This redirection
   happens during the IKE_SA_INIT and server does not maintain any
   information about the redirected client.  After mutual authentication
   and optional proxy session negotiation trust anchor redirects the
   client back to the server with an Access Token which can be used as a
   dynamic pre-shared key between the server and client for password
   based IKE_AUTH exchange.  Mechanism described here allows servers to
   compute the same pre-shared key dynamically, without contacting trust
   anchors, based on the information provided by the client during
   IKE_AUTH exchange.  Access Token based authentication permits IDr of
   the responder to be different from that specified in Ticket and
   permits client to reuse the proxy session (negotiated between client
   and trust anchor) between client and server.

   Such a mechanism is useful especially for low power devices like
   handsets.  For example, a mobile node can redirect a correspondent
   node to its home agent.  Home agent can form a proxy session with
   correspondent node and then redirect it back to mobile node.

Internet-Draft  IKEv2 Redirect and Authentication Offload  December 2009


1.  Introduction

   IKEv2 [RFC4306] supports multiple authentication mechanisms like
   public key signatures, shared secrets and EAP.  EAP based
   authentication requires server to maintain information about the
   client until EAP completes.  Public key based authentication
   mechanisms are highly computational intensive and demands server CPU
   resources.

   Redirect Mechanism for IKEv2 [IKEv2REDIRECT]proposes a mechanism for
   IKEv2 that enables a VPN gateway to redirect the VPN client to
   another VPN gateway, for example, based on the load condition.
   Redirect can be done during the IKE_SA_INIT, IKE_AUTH exchange or in
   the middle of a session.

   IKEv2 Session Resumption [IKEv2RESUMPTION] proposes an extension to
   IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway
   in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE
   SA.

   Redirect mechanism can be used to redirect a client to another router
   (trust anchor) to do mutual authentication and an optional proxy
   session negotiation on behalf of the server.  This redirection
   happens during the IKE_SA_INIT and server does not maintain any
   information about the redirected client.  After mutual authentication
   and optional proxy session negotiation trust anchor redirects the
   client back to the server with an Access Token which can be used as a
   dynamic pre-shared key between the server and client for password
   based IKE_AUTH exchange.  Mechanism described here allows servers to
   compute the same pre-shared key dynamically, without contacting trust
   anchors, based on the information provided by the client during
   IKE_AUTH exchange.

   IKEv2 Session Resumption assumes that the client always resumes into
   the same gateway that generated the ticket.  IKE_AUTH exchange that
   follows the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange does not use any
   authentication mechanisms like pre-shared key or certificates.  That
   means the ID values sent in the IKE_AUTH exchange can not be re-
   authenticated and MUST be identical to the values included in the
   ticket.  But Authentication Offload mechanism explained in this memo
   allows servers to compute a pre-shared key dynamically based on the
   information provided by the client during IKE_AUTH exchange.  Clients
   learn the same pre-shared key from the trust anchors during IKE_AUTH
   exchange.  That means the IKE_AUTH exchange that follows the
   IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange can independently verify the identities
   of both parties based on a common pre-shared key computed
   dynamically.  This method is utilized in this memo and proxy session
   resumption is made possible with an IDr which is different from the

   one mentioned in the ticket.  Access tokens computed are linked to
   IDi values and MUST not be changed.

   Trust anchor MUST choose the same cryptographic suit from client's
   offer which the server would have chosen if the client had contacted
   server directly.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   o  Trust Anchor : A router (or set of dedicated routers) that can act
      as a proxy for a server to do mutual authentication and proxy
      session negotiation on behalf of the server.
   o  GP_SECRET : Gate Pass Secret (GP_SECRET) is a random number
      generated by server.  Server shares GP_SECRET with all trust
      anchors in a secure way.
   o  GP_SECRET_INDEX : Server maintains a history of GP_SECRET and each
      GP_SECRET is uniquely identified by the GP_SECRET_INDEX
   o  GP_KEY : Gate Pass Key (GP_KEY) is a set of secret keys, updated
      periodically and identified by an Index.  GP_KEY is used to
      generate and verify GATE_PASS.
   o  GATE_PASS : Identifies the transitive trust channel (server to
      trust anchor).
   o  ACCESS_TOKEN : Passwords generated by trust anchors to be used
      between server and clients.  Servers and anchor routers compute
      tokens independently but based on a common information known only
      to them.
   o  PROXY_TICKET : An IKEv2 ticket [IKEv2RESUMPTION] is a data
      structure that contains all the necessary information that allows
      an IKEv2 responder to re-establish an IKEv2 security association.
      PROXY_TICKET is an IKEv2 ticket negotiated between client and
      trust anchor.  IKEv2 Auth offload mechanism explained in this memo
      allows proxy session resumption with an IDr which is different
      from the one mentioned in the IKEv2 ticket.


3.  GP_SECRET

   Gate Pass Secret (GP_SECRET) is a random number generated by server.
   Server shares GP_SECRET with trust anchor in a secure way
   (distribution mechanism is explained in Section 9 ).  Length of
   GP_SECRET is decided by the encryption algorithm negotiated between
   server and trust anchor in the context of IKE_SA.

4.  GP_SECRET_INDEX

   Gate Pass Secret index(GP_SECRET_INDEX) identifies the GP_SECRET.
   Server maintains a history of GP_SECRET and each GP_SECRET is
   uniquely identified by the GP_SECRET_INDEX


5.  GP_KEY

   GP_KEY is a set of authentication and encryption keys, updated
   periodically and identified by an Index.  GP_KEY has the following
   structure.

   GP_KEY = {

   GP_KEY.ek

   GP_KEY.ak

   GP_KEY.index

   }

   This specification does not define the size of these fields and is
   left up to the server to choose based on the algorithms it use.

   GP_KEY.index is carried in a GATE_PASS(Section 6).

   GP_KEY.ek key is used to encrypt the {trust anchor, server specific
   informations } fields of the GATE_PASS.

   GP_KEY.ak key is used to sign the encrypted part in the GATE_PASS.

   When server receives an AUTH message authenticated by IKEv2 trust
   anchor method, server verifies the Signature on the GATE_PASS using
   the GP_KEY.ak.  If this check fails, server MUST drop the AUTH
   message and MAY send AUTHENTICATION_FAILED message.


6.  GATE_PASS

   An IKEv2 GATE_PASS is a data structure generated by the server and
   contains all the necessary information that allows server to
   recompute ACCESS_TOKEN based on the client's IDi.  Server encrypt and
   integrity protect GATE_PASS using GP_KEY and distributes to trust
   anchors using N(GATE_PASS) notify payload.  Clients receive the same
   GATE_PASS from the trust anchors and include it in IKE_SA_INIT or
   KE_SESSION_RESUME exchange when it restarts its IKE exchange with the

   server.  Server computes GATE_PASS using following mechanism.

   GATE_PASS = Signature | GP_KEY.Index | Secret

   Length of each field is not defined by this specification and can be
   defined by the server depending on the algorithms it uses for
   computing these.  Secret and Signature can be computed using
   following mechanism.

   Secret = encrypt(GP_KEY.ek, {Trust Anchor IP | Trust Anchor ID |
   GP_SECRET_INDEX | server specific informations })

   Signature = prf(GP_KEY.ak | GP_KEY.Index | Secret)

   Where encrypt() and prf() are the encryption and pseudo random number
   generator algorithms that the server wants to use.

   Trust anchor sends GATE_PASS to client using N(GATE_PASS) notify
   payload along with the N(REDIRECT) [IKEv2REDIRECT],
   N(ACCESS_TOKEN)(Section 7) and optional N(TICKET_OPAQUE)
   [IKEv2RESUMPTION] payloads.


7.  ACCESS_TOKEN

   Client MUST use ACCESS_TOKEN as the pre-shared key for password based
   authentication between server and client if client includes
   N(GATE_PASS) in the IKE_AUTH exchange.  AUTH is computed using the
   same mechanism specified in Section 2.15 of IKEv2 RFC [RFC4306] using
   pre-shared keys.  Server computes the same ACCESS_TOKEN using
   client's identity, GATE_PASS and GP_SECRET.

   ACCESS_TOKEN = prf(encrypt(GP_SECRET, GATE_PASS | Client's Identity))

   Where prf() and encrypt() are the pseudo random number generator
   algorithm and encryption algorithm negotiated between server and
   trust anchor during IKE_SA.  It MUST be picked from the same IKE
   channel through which the server has distributed GP_SECRET and
   GATE_PASS to Trust Anchor.

   Client's Identity is the identity specified by IDi payload during
   IKE_AUTH exchange.

   Trust anchor sends ACCESS_TOKEN to client using N(ACCESS_TOKEN)
   payload along with N(GATE_PASS) and N(REDIRECT) payloads to redirect
   it back to the server.

   N(REDIRECT) is defined in [IKEv2REDIRECT].

Internet-Draft  IKEv2 Redirect and Authentication Offload  December 2009


   N(ACCESS_TOKEN) payloads can be included only after successful
   verification of client's identity.


8.  PROXY_TICKET

   PROXY_TICKET is an IKEv2 ticket [IKEv2RESUMPTION] negotiated between
   client and trust anchor.  IKEv2 Auth offload mechanism explained in
   this memo allows proxy session resumption with an IDr which is
   different from the one mentioned in the IKEv2 ticket.  Clients can
   include N(PROXY_TICKET_SUPPORTED) along with N(REDIRECT_SUPPORTED)
   and N(GATE_PASS_SUPPORTED) in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange to inform
   proxy support for IKEv2 Session Resumption [IKEv2RESUMPTION]
   capability to the servers or trust anchors.  Server redirects clients
   to trust anchors for authentication and proxy session negotiations.
   Trust anchor redirects clients back to server after successful
   authentication and proxy session negotiations.  Trust anchors MUST
   not use Ticket by reference [IKEv2RESUMPTION] for passing Tickets to
   clients, instead, it MUST use Ticket by value [IKEv2RESUMPTION]
   method.  If proxy session resumption is supported trust anchor MUST
   encrypt and integrity protect the Ticket using the GP_SECRET
   associated with the GATE_PASS.  Client MUST include N(GATE_PASS)
   along with N(TICKET_OPAQUE) [IKEv2RESUMPTION] payload in the
   IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange [IKEv2RESUMPTION] to indicate that the
   resumed session is a proxy session and the identities (old IDi of
   client and new IDr of server) are authenticated separately using
   GATE_PASS in the IKE_AUTH exchange.  Server MUST not accept the
   Tickets with different IDr if N(GATE_PASS) is not included.  If
   N(GATE_PASS) is included in the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange then the
   IDr contained in the Ticket MUST be the same as Trust Anchor ID
   contained in the GATE_PASS, otherwise this MUST be considered as
   normal IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange and IDr MUST be the same as that
   of the responder (server).


9.  GP_SECRET and GATE_PASS Distribution to Trust Anchor

   Server MAY periodically update GP_KEY and GP_SECRET and each time it
   updates it MUST recompute and redistributes the associated GATE_PASS
   and GP_SECRET to all trust anchors (if they support this feature,
   indicated by N(GATE_PASS_SUPPORTED) in the INIT exchange).  This way
   servers can restrict the life time of tokens issued to clients.
   Server MAY maintain a history of GP_KEYs and GP_SECRETs for a
   duration decided by server's policy to support clients who bring old
   GATE_PASS but still valid based on GP_KEY history.

   Server uses an INFORMATIONAL exchange to distribute GATE_PASS and
   GP_SECRET.  Server and trust anchor need not retain the IKE SAs but

   in such cases they MUST remember the prf and encryption algorithms
   negotiated.

   Additionally, trust anchor MAY include N(GATE_PASS), N(ACCESS_TOKEN)
   and N(TICKET_OPAQUE) payloads along with N(REDIRECT, Initial_IP_R)in
   the IKE_AUTH if client specified these capabilities in the INIT
   exchange.  In such cases trust anchor MUST use the same IP of
   Initial_IP_R received from N(REDIRECTED_FROM, Initial_IP_R) to
   redirect it back to the same server.

   N(ACCESS_TOKEN) payloads MUST be included only after verifying
   client's identity.

   If trust anchor decides to include N(TICKET_OPAQUE) along with
   N(REDIRECT, Initial_IP_R) in the IKE_AUTH exchange it MUST also
   include N(GATE_PASS)and N(ACCESS_TOKEN) in the exchange.

   If trust anchor had redirected the client with N(TICKET_OPAQUE)
   payload, client MUST use IKEv2 Session Resumption Exchange
   (Section 12) to resume the proxy session (established between client
   and trust anchor) with the server, otherwise client MUST proceed with
   IKE_SA_INIT exchange (Section 13) and SHOULD include N(GATE_PASS)
   payload in the exchange to prevent it from getting redirected again.

     N(GATE_PASS)

   Client can resume a proxy session with server if it holds a valid
   PROXY_TICKET, GATE_PASS and ACCESS_TOKEN and in such cases client
   MUST include N(GATE_PASS) in the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange to
   indicate that the resumed session is a proxy session and the
   identities (old IDi of client and new IDr of server) are
   authenticated separately using GATE_PASS in the IKE_AUTH exchange.
   Client and Server MUST use GATE_PASS based IKE_AUTH exchange
   (Section 14) to resume the proxy session.  Server MUST not accept the
   Tickets with different IDr if N(GATE_PASS) is not included.  Server
   MUST not accept the N(GATE_PASS) if Trust_Anchor_IP contained in
   N(REDIRECTED_FROM,Trust_Anchor_IP)is different from Trust Anchor IP
   contained in N(GATE_PASS).  If N(GATE_PASS) is included in the
   IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange then the IDr contained in the Ticket MUST
   be the same as Trust Anchor ID contained in the GATE_PASS otherwise
   this MUST be considered as normal IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange and IDr
   MUST be the same as that of the responder (server) and both parties
   MUST use the IKE_AUTH Exchange mentioned in section 4.3.3 of IKEv2
   Session Resumption [IKEv2RESUMPTION].

   algorithm and encryption algorithm negotiated between server and
   trust anchor during IKE_SA.  It MUST be picked from the same IKE

   GATE_PASS to Trust Anchor.

   If server prefers to provide AUTH based on GATE_PASS it MUST include
   the same GATE_PASS received in the reply.

17.  IANA Considerations

   Section 15 defines five new IKEv2 notifications whose Message Type
   values are to be allocated from the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types -
   Status Types" registry.

   o GATE_PASS_SUPPORTED

   o PROXY_TICKET_SUPPORTED

   o GATE_PASS

   o ACCESS_TOKEN

   o GP_SECRET


18.  Security Considerations

   Servers MUST periodically update GATE_PASS.  This is required to
   prevent clients from reusing the tokens.  It is a good idea to force
   clients to reauthenticate when the GATE_PASS expires using
   N(AUTH_LIFETIME).  [RFC4478]

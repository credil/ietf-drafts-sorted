  Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Names
                                (CNAMEs)
                     draft-begen-avt-rtp-cnames-02

Abstract

   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a
   persistent transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the
   Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may
   change if a collision is detected, or when the RTP application is
   restarted, the CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP
   endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP
   media streams.  For proper functionality, CNAMEs should be unique
   within the participants of an RTP session.  However, the existing
   guidelines for choosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP standard
   are insufficient to achieve this uniqueness.  This memo updates these
   guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique CNAMEs.

Internet-Draft             Choosing RTCP CNAME                  May 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Section 6.5.1 of [RFC3550], there are a number of recommendations
   for choosing a unique RTCP CNAME for an RTP endpoint.  However, in
   practice, some of these methods are not guaranteed to produce a
   unique CNAME.  This memo proposes updated guidelines for choosing
   CNAMEs, superceding those presented in Section 6.5.1 of [RFC3550].


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Deficiencies with Earlier RTCP CNAME Guidelines

   The recommendation in [RFC3550] is to generate the CNAME of the form
   "user@host" for multiuser systems, or "host" if the username is not
   available.  The "host" part is specified to be the fully qualified
   domain name (FQDN) of the host from which the real-time data
   originates.  However, FQDNs are not necessarily unique, and can
   sometimes be common across several endpoints in large service
   provider networks.  Thus, the use of FQDN as the CNAME is strongly
   discouraged.

   For hosts that do not have a unique domain name, the "host" part of
   the RTCP CNAME could be the numeric representation of the IP address
   of the interface from which the RTP data originates.  However, as
   noted in [RFC3550], the use of private network address space
   [RFC1918] can result in hosts having network addresses that are not
   globally unique.  This can also occur with public IP addresses, if
   multiple hosts are assigned the same public IP address and connected
   to a Network Address Translation (NAT) device [RFC3022].  When
   multiple hosts share the same IP address, whether private or public,
   using the IP address as the CNAME leads to CNAMEs that are not
   necessarily unique.

   [RFC3550] also notes that if hosts with private addresses and no
   direct IP connectivity to the public Internet have their RTP packets
   forwarded to the public Internet through an RTP-level translator,
   they may end up having non-unique CNAMEs.  [RFC3550] suggests that
   such applications provide a configuration option to allow the user to
   choose a unique CNAME, and puts the burden on the translator to
   translate CNAMEs from private addresses to public addresses if
   necessary to keep private addresses from being exposed.  Experience
   has shown that this does not work well in practice.

4.  Choosing an RTCP CNAME

   It is difficult, and in some cases impossible, for a host to
   determine if there is a NAT between itself and its RTP peer.
   Furthermore, even some public IPv4 addresses can be shared by
   multiple hosts in the Internet.  Thus, using the numeric
   representation of the IPv4 address as the "host" part of the RTCP
   CNAME is NOT RECOMMENDED.

4.1.  Persistent vs. Per-Session CNAMEs

   The RTCP CNAME can either be persistent across different RTP sessions
   for an RTP endpoint; or it can be unique per session, meaning that an
   RTP endpoint chooses a different CNAME for each RTP session.

   Persistent CNAMEs:  To provide a binding across multiple media tools
   used by one participant in a set of related RTP sessions, the CNAME
   SHOULD be fixed for that participant.  A persistent CNAME is also
   useful to facilitate third-party monitoring, allowing network
   management tools to correlate the ongoing quality of service across
   multiple RTP sessions for fault diagnosis and to understand long-term
   network performance statistics.

   Per-Session CNAMEs:  The advantage of this approach is that the CNAME
   is unique for each RTP session.  This prevents the CNAME from being
   used for traffic analysis.  In other words, the RTP endpoints cannot
   be identified based on their CNAMEs.  This provides privacy, but
   inhibits the use of RTCP as a tool for long-term network management
   and monitoring.

4.2.  Guidelines

   RTP endpoints SHOULD practice one of the following guidelines in
   choosing RTCP CNAME:

   o  Given that IPv6 addresses are naturally unique, an endpoint MAY
      use its IPv6 address as the "host" part of its CNAME regardless of
      whether that IPv6 interface is being used for RTP communication or
      not.  If the RTP endpoint is associated with an IPv6 privacy
      address [RFC4941] or a unique local IPv6 unicast address
      [RFC4193], that address MAY be used as well.  Using IPv6 addresses
      as the "host" part of a CNAME was originally suggested in
      [RFC3550].

   o  An endpoint that does not know its fully qualified domain name,
      and is configured with a private IP address on the interface it is
      using for RTP communication, MAY use the numeric representation of
      the layer-2 (MAC) address of that interface as the "host" part of

      its CNAME.  For IEEE 802 MAC addresses, such as Ethernet, the
      standard colon-separated hexadecimal format is to be used, e.g.,
      "00:23:32:af:9b:aa".

   o  An endpoint MAY use its Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID)
      [RFC4122] to generate the "host" part of its CNAME.  The string
      representation described in Section 3 of [RFC4122] should be used,
      which results in a 288-bit string representation.

   o  To generate a unique CNAME for each RTP session, an endpoint MAY
      perform SHA1-HMAC [RFC2104] on the concatenated values of the RTP
      endpoint's initial SSRC, the source and destination IP addresses
      and ports, and a randomly-generated value [RFC4086], and then
      truncate the 160-bit output to 96 bits and finally convert the 96
      bits to ASCII using Base64 encoding [RFC4648].  This results in a
      128-bit printable CNAME.  Note that the CNAME MUST NOT change if
      an SSRC collision occurs, hence only the initial SSRC value chosen
      by the endpoint is used.

   Each of the techniques is equally effective in generating unique
   CNAMEs, and an RTP application MAY choose any of these techniques to
   use.


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3550] apply to this document as
   well.

   In some environments, notably telephony, a fixed CNAME value allows
   separate RTP sessions to be correlated and eliminates the obfuscation
   provided by IPv6 privacy addresses [RFC4941] or IPv4 NAPT [RFC3022].
   Secure RTP (SRTP) [RFC3711] can help prevent such correlation by
   encrypting Secure RTCP (SRTCP) but it should be noted that SRTP only
   mandates SRTCP integrity protection (not encryption).  Thus, RTP
   applications used in such environments should consider encrypting
   their SRTCP or generate a new CNAME value for each RTP session as
   described in Section 4.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.

Internet-Draft      Rapid Acquisition of RTP Sessions      February 2010


1.  Introduction

   In (any-source or source-specific) multicast RTP applications,
   destination ports, i.e., the ports on which the multicast receivers
   receive the RTP and RTCP packets, are defined declaratively.  In
   other words, the receivers cannot choose their receive ports and the
   sender(s) use the pre-defined ports.

   In unicast RTP applications, the receiving end often needs to choose
   its receive ports for RTP and RTCP.  It may convey its request to the
   sending end through different ways, one of which is the Offer/Answer
   Model [RFC3264] for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].
   However, the Offer/Answer Model requires offer/answer exchange(s)
   between the endpoints, and the resulting delay may not be acceptable
   in delay-sensitive real-time applications.

   RTP sessions are defined based on the destination addresses
   [RFC3550].  While the declaration and selection of the ports are well
   defined and work well for multicast and unicast RTP applications,
   respectively, the usage of the ports introduces complications when a
   receiving end mixes unicast and multicast RTP sessions within the
   same RTP application.

   An example scenario is where the RTP packets are distributed through
   source-specific multicast (SSM) and a receiver sends unicast RTCP
   feedback to a local repair server (also functioning as a feedback
   target) [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm] asking for a retransmission of the
   packets it is missing, and the local repair server sends the
   retransmissions over a unicast RTP session [RFC4588].

   Another scenario is where a receiver wants to rapidly acquire a new
   primary multicast RTP session and receives one or more RTP
   retransmissions over a unicast session before joining the SSM session
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp].  Similar scenarios exist in
   applications where some part of the content is distributed through
   multicast while the receivers get additional and/or auxiliary content
   through one or more unicast connections, as sketched in Figure 1.

   In this document, we discuss this problem and introduce alternative
   solutions that we refer to as Port Mapping.  These solutions allow
   receivers to choose their desired RTP and RTCP receive ports for
   every unicast session when they are running RTP applications using
   both unicast and multicast services.

   In the remainder of this document, we refer to the RTP endpoints that
   serve other RTP endpoints over a unicast session as the Servers.  The
   receiving RTP endpoints are referred to as Clients.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Design Guidelines

   We have the following design guidelines in developing a port mapping
   solution:

   o  Design a scalable and distributable system.  This drives the
      design towards a system in which all of the actions associated
      with a given set of flows at a given instant in time are distinct
      from actions on other flows.  This allows the system to be
      dynamically segmented as dictated by dynamic conditions in the
      network.

   o  Use atomic, client-driven transactions in order to limit the
      amount of state information maintained by the server.

   o  Use idempotent transactions in order to limit the impact to the
      overall system when messages are lost.  The state of the system
      thus only depends on the last successfully received message.

   o  Do not try to correlate information from messages that do not
      fate-share.  In other words, if an information is logically
      coupled to other information, send all of the data in a single
      transaction to the extent that this is practical.

   o  Do not introduce new vectors for attacks.

   o  Do not carry transport addresses explicitly at the application
      layer, which is a layer violation.

   o  Do not have any IPv4/IPv6 dependencies.  To the extent that
      addressing information is required to persist across transactions,
      handle the addresses in a manner that allows the server to give
      opaque address information (called Cookie) to the client.  The
      client then presents the opaque addressing information back to the
      server in subsequent transactions.  This allows the system to
      maintain connectivity information without unduly burdening the
      server(s) with state information.

      Note that the cookies are not meant to be understood by the
      clients or other application-layer gateway devices.  Thus, a
      server may use any method of its choice to make the cookie data
      opaque.

   o  Be NAT-tolerant [RFC5389] [RFC4787].


4.  Port Mapping

   We present the details of the proposed solutions in the context of an
   example application.

   Consider an SSM distribution network where a distribution source
   multicasts RTP packets to a large number of clients, and one or more
   retransmission servers function as feedback targets to collect
   unicast RTCP feedback from these clients [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].
   When a client detects a missing packet in the primary multicast
   session, it requests a retransmission from one of the retransmission
   servers.  The client may or may not be behind a NAT device.  We first
   consider the simpler scenario where there are no NAT devices between
   the server and client.  We then discuss the implications of NAT

       Figure 3: SDP describing an SSM distribution with support for
                    retransmissions from a local server

   In this SDP, the source stream is multicast from a distribution
   source (with a source IP address of 198.51.100.1) to the multicast
   destination address of 233.252.0.2 and port 41000.  A retransmission
   server including feedback target functionality (with an address of
   192.0.2.1 and port of 41001) is specified with the 'rtcp' attribute.
   The RTCP port for the unicast session (41003) is also specified with
   the 'rtcp' attribute.

   Based on this SDP, we define the following parameters:

   o  DS=198.51.100.1 - Address of the distribution source

   o  G=233.252.0.2 - Destination address where the primary multicast
      stream is sent to

   o  P1=41000 - Destination RTP port where the primary multicast stream
      is sent to

   o  P2=41001 - Destination RTCP port on the retransmission server and
      clients for the primary multicast session

   o  S=192.0.2.1 - Address of the retransmission server

Internet-Draft      Rapid Acquisition of RTP Sessions      February 2010


   o  P3=41002 - Source RTP port on the retransmission server for the
      unicast session

   o  P4=41003 - RTCP port on the retransmission server for the unicast
      session

   We denote the client address by C. *c1 denotes the port on the client
   used to send the unicast feedback in the primary multicast session.
   *c2 and *c3 denote the RTP and RTCP ports on the client used in the
   unicast session, respectively.  The '*' before the port numbers means
   that these port numbers are chosen by the client, and not assigned/
   imposed by another entity.  Note that if the client implements RTP/
   RTCP port muxing [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-and-rtcp-mux] in the unicast
   session, c2 will equal c3.

   During the lifetime of a unicast session, the server needs to
   remember the IP address and ports c2 and c3 of the client.

4.2.  Server-Generated Cookie Approach

4.2.1.  Steps

   This approach follows the steps outlined below:

   1.  The client ascertains server address and port number(s) from the
       SDP description (S, P3 and P4).

   2.  The client determines its port numbers (*c2 and *c3).

   3.  The client sends a message to the server via a new RTCP message,
       called PortMappingRequest.  Separate messages are sourced from
       ports c2 and c3 on the client.  Note that normally the message
       sent from port c2 should be addressed to port P3 on the server,
       and the message sent from port c3 should be addressed to port P4
       on the server.  However, since the former RTCP message is sent to
       an RTP port (P3), the server is required to implement RTP/RTCP
       port muxing on this port [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-and-rtcp-mux].  Thus,
       the server MUST support RTP/RTCP port muxing, and both
       PortMappingRequest messages sourced from ports c2 and c3 MUST be
       sent to port P3 on the server.

   4.  The server derives client address (C) and its RTP and RTCP ports
       (c2 and c3) from the received messages.

   5.  For each PortMappingRequest message, the server generates an
       opaque encapsulation (called Cookie) that conveys the addressing
       information using a reversible transform only known to the
       server.

Internet-Draft      Rapid Acquisition of RTP Sessions      February 2010


   6.  The server sends each cookie back to the client using a new RTCP
       message, called PortMappingResponse.

       Editor's note:  Normally, each PortMappingResponse message needs
       to be sent back to the port where the request came from.
       However, this requires the client to implement RTP/RTCP port
       muxing on port c2.  If the client supports port muxing, then
       there is no need to select a port c3 and the client needs one
       cookie.  However, if the client does not support port muxing,
       both PortMappingResponse messages MUST be sent to port c3 on the
       client.  In that case, each PortMappingResponse message MUST
       indicate whether the cookie is for the RTP or RTCP port on the
       client side.

       Editor's note:  What type of a flag/field should we add to the
       PortMappingRequest and PortMappingResponse messages?

       For the server to be able to send the PortMappingResponse for
       port c2 to port c3, we need to include the cookie for port c3
       when requesting the cookie for port c2.  This introduces delay
       and dependency, which may be a drawback in certain applications
       (See Figure 4).

   7.  The client includes the cookie(s) when necessary in the
       subsequent messages sent to the server.

   8.  Normal flows ensue, with the server using the addressing
       encapsulated in the opaque cookie(s).

4.2.2.  Implications of NATs

   If there are no NAT devices between the server and client, the client
   MUST acquire a cookie for each distinct 2-tuple of (S, c2) and (S,
   c3).  In other words, as long as the client uses the same local ports
   and the same server, it can use the same cookies when communicating
   with any feedback target running on this server.  The advantage here
   is that the client can acquire the necessary cookies at the very
   beginning for every port pair (if it is not port-muxing) it is
   planning to use, and thus, can avoid the delays incurred to acquire
   the cookies later when it wants to use a new unicast service.

   If there is a NAT device between the server and client, the client
   may still acquire the cookies at the beginning, provided that it is
   behind a NAT that assigns the same public IP address and port for the
   messages sent from the same internal IP address and port even when
   ithe client is talking to different destinations.  However, if this
   is not true, i.e., the public address(es) and/or port(s) of the
   client changes when the client communicates with a different feedback

   target on the same server, the client MUST fall back to acquiring a
   cookie for each distinct 3-tuple of (S, P3, c2) and (S, P3, c3).

   Figure 4 shows the message flows, where each message is appended with
   the (Source Address, Source Port, Destination Address, Destination
   Port) information.  In this section, we assume that the client does
   not mux the RTP and RTCP ports.

          Figure 4: Message flows for server-side cookie approach

   Editor's note:  When sending the sender reports in the unicast
   session, how does the server know which port the client is expecting
   to receive them on?  Does this imply that the server needs to
   remember the specific RTCP port for each client?  Update:  Yes, this
   is part of the session state information.

   In the example above, the compound RTCP packet carrying the NACK
   message also carries the Cookie(c2) since the server must know which
   port the client is expecting to receive the RTP retransmission
   packet(s) on.  Some other feedback messages such as the RAMS-R
   message defined in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] will
   result in both RTP and RTCP packets to be sent by the server to the
   client.  The compound RTCP packet carrying such a feedback message
   MUST carry both Cookie(c2) and Cookie(c3).  If an RTCP message from
   the client will not trigger any transmission from the server (e.g.,
   RTCP receiver and extended reports), it does not have to include any
   cookies.

4.3.  Receiver-Generated Cookie Approach

4.3.1.  Steps

   This approach follows the steps outlined below:

   1.  The client ascertains server address and port number from the SDP
       description (S and P3).

   2.  The client determines its port numbers (*c2 and *c3).

   3.  The client generates a random cookie.

   4.  The client sends separate RTCP packets from its ports c2 and c3
       to the server port P3 to setup the NAT.  Each RTCP packet
       indicates through a bit/field whether it source port will be used
       for RTP or RTCP traffic by the client.  The client repeats this
       step as deemed necessary to keep the NAT bindings alive.

   5.  The client sends unicast feedback from its port c1 to server port
       P2 where the RTCP feedback message also carries the cookie from
       Step 3.

   6.  The server correlates these three RTCP packets based on the
       cookie value, and remembers the public IP address(es) and port(s)
       of the client when sending packets back to the client.

       If the client supports RTP/RTCP port muxing, the server needs to

Internet-Draft      Rapid Acquisition of RTP Sessions      February 2010


       remember only one public IP address and port.  The state
       information the server has to keep is reduced but not totally
       eliminated.

       If the server is about to send an RTP and/or RTCP packet to the
       client but does not know the port mappings since it has not
       received one or both of the RTCP packets sent in Step 4, it
       cannot start transmission.  Eventually, the client times out and
       resends the RTCP packets carrying the cookie from its ports c2
       and c3.  Note that if the client supports port muxing, the
       failure probability is substantially reduced.  Once the server
       figures out the port mappings, it keeps that state information
       until the unicast session is ended.

       After the server has established a port mapping for the 2-tuple
       of cookie and public IP address of the client, it discards RTCP
       packets carrying the same cookie coming from the same public IP
       address but from a different public port.  The reason is that
       such packets are likely to be sent by an attacker since there is
       no good reason for a client to change its port during a short-
       lived session.  Thus, if two different clients sharing the same
       public IP address accidentally generate the same random cookie
       and send it to the same port on the server, only the first port
       mapping will be valid.  If neither client is not port-muxing, the
       (total 4) RTCP packets can cross each other resulting in a
       failure.

       To minimize the chances for a failure in the receiver-generated
       cookie approach, the client should support port muxing and the
       generated cookies should be truely random.

4.3.2.  Implications of NATs

   If there are no NAT devices between the server and client, there is
   no risk of a cookie collision.  Thus, it is safe to use this
   approach.

   When there is a NAT device between the server and client, there is a
   risk of a cookie collision, although it is unlikely if the random
   cookies are generated properly.


5.  Message Formats

   The PortMappingRequest message has the following format:

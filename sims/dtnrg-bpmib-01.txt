Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                  May 2011


1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing information about a Bundle Node [RFC5050] - or
   simply a 'Node' within the scope of this document.  More
   specifically, the manageable objects for such a Node include: Node-
   Specific information, registered Endpoint-Specific information, and
   generic CLA-Specific (Convergence Layer Adapter) information.


3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


4.  Overview

   The Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] was designed as part of the
   solution to issues encountered in Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN)
   environments [RFC4838], which are otherwise unresolvable by the
   connection-oriented scheme used in today's Internet.  This memo
   contains the definitions for a Bundle Protocol MIB as well as
   rationale for certain implementation decisions.  Also contained in
   this memo is a section dedicated to considerations for future
   designers of DTN-related MIBs.  The MIB module defined in this memo
   contains object definitions for a single Node, for each Endpoints of
   which that Node is a member, and for the CLAs which that Node has
   access to use.

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                  May 2011


4.1.  Structure of the MIB

   Objects within the BP-MIB have been derived from RFC 5050 [RFC5050]
   or were designed to be used in the management of a BP Node, but are
   not explicitly derived from RFC 5050 [RFC5050].  These objects are
   broken down into three main groups:

   o  Node-Specific Definitions

   o  Endpoint-Specific Definitions

   o  CLA-Specific Definitions

4.1.1.  Node-Specific Definitions

   Within this document, objects that are referred to as 'Node-Specific'
   are those objects which relate only to the Node being managed.  In
   other words, these objects do not relate to a Node's relationship
   with any other entity (i.e.  Endpoints and CLAs).  Node-Specific
   objects include:

   o  A unique name given to the Node Instance (bpNodeID)

   o  The Bundle Protocol version being used by the managed Node
      (bpBundleVersion

   o  The amount of storage available to the managed Node
      (bpAvailStorage)

   o  The last time a Node was restarted (bpLastUpTime)

   o  The number of locally generated Bundles for each priority type
      (bpBulkPriorGenBndls, bpNormPriorGenBndls, and bpExpPriorGenBndls)

   o  The number of locally generated Bytes for each priority type
      (bpBulkPriorGenBytes, bpNormPriorGenBytes, and bpExpPriorGenBytes)

   o  The number of locally queued Bundles for each priority type
      (bpBulkPriorQueuedBndls, bpNormPriorQueuedBndls, and
      bpExpPriorQueuedBndls)

   o  The number of locally queued Bytes for each priority type
      (bpBulkPriorQueuedBytes, bpNormPriorQueuedBytes, and
      bpExpPriorQueuedBytes)

   o  The number of locally queued Bundles for each type of retention
      constraint (bpReassemblyPendingBndls, bpDispatchPendingBndls,
      bpForwardPendingBndls, and bpCustodyAcceptedBndls)

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                  May 2011


   o  The number of locally queued Bytes for each type of retention
      constraint (bpReassemblyPendingBytes, bpDispatchPendingBytes,
      bpForwardPendingBytes, and bpCustodyAcceptedBytes)

   o  The number of reports received by this Node for each of the report
      types (bpBundleReceptions, bpBundleAcceptance, bpBundleForwarding,
      bpCustodySuccess, and bpBundleDelivery)

   o  The number of times this Node took a specific action on (or failed
      to take action on) Bundles.  Specifically, these actions involve:
      custody acceptance, forwarding, abandoning, discarding, deletion
      (for each or the reasons specified in RFC 5050 [RFC5050]), and
      fragmenting (bpCustodyFailureBndls, bpForwardFailureBndls,
      bpAbandonedDeliveryBndls, bpDiscardedBndls, bpFragmentedLocally,
      bpDelExpired, bpDelTransCancelled, bpDelDepStorage,
      bpDelDestUnintel, bpDelNoRoute, bpDelUntimelyContact,
      bpDelBlockUnintel, and bpDelNoAdditionalInfo)

   o  The number of Bytes affected by this Node taking a specific action
      on (or failing to take action on) Bundles.  Specifically, these
      actions involve: custody acceptance, forwarding, abandoning,
      discarding, and deletion (bpCustodyFailureBytes,
      bpForwardFailureBytes, bpAbandonedDeliveryBytes, and
      bpDiscardedBytes)

   o  The number of fragments created by the managed Node
      (bpFragmentsCreated) and

   o  Denotation of available BP Extension Blocks (bpExtBlockType and
      bpExtBlockDisplayName)

   Each of these objects are detailed more precisely in the MIB's
   description fields.

4.1.2.  Endpoint-Specific Definitions

   Within this document, objects that are referred to as 'Endpoint-
   Specific' are those objects which relate to a specific Endpoint in
   respect to the managed Node.  In other words, the information managed
   by these objects are subject only to the Node's view of the Endpoint
   (e.g. the current state of the Endpoint is "active" according to this
   Node OR the number of Bundles this Node has received through this
   Endpoint is 42).  Endpoint-Specific objects are maintained within a
   conceptual table (with the exception of bpRegCount).  The following
   objects fall under this category:

   o  The number of currently registered Endpoints (bpRegCount)

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                  May 2011


   o  The ID/address of the Endpoint Entry (bpEndpointID)

   o  Denotation of the BP's current state for this Endpoint
      (bpCurState)

   o  Denotation of whether the Endpoint is a Singleton (bpIsSingleton)

   o  Denotation of the Delivery Failure Action for this Endpoint
      (bpDeliveryFailureAction)

   o  The number of times this Endpoint has experienced the following
      Bundle activities: received (for each priority type), delivered,
      sent, and forwarded (bpBulkPriorRecvdBndls, bpNormPriorRecvdBndls,
      bpExpPriorRecvdBndls, bpBundlesDeliveredBndls, bpBundlesSentBndls,
      and bpBundlesForwardedBndls)

   o  The number of Bytes affected due to this Endpoint experiencing the
      following Bundle activities: received (for each priority type),
      delivered, sent, and forwarded (bpBulkPriorRecvdBytes,
      bpNormPriorRecvdBytes, bpExpPriorRecvdBytes,
      bpBundlesDeliveredBytes, bpBundlesSentBytes, and
      bpBundlesForwardedBytes) and

   o  The number of Bundle Deletion Reports received on this Endpoint
      for each of the reasons specified in RFC 5050 [RFC5050]
      (bpDelExpiredReports, bpDelTransCancelledReports,
      bpDelDepStorageReports, bpDelDestUnintelReports,
      bpDelNoRouteReports, bpDelUntimelyContactReports,
      bpDelBlockUnintelReports, and bpDelNoAdditionalInfoReports)

   Each of these objects are detailed more precisely in the MIB's
   description fields.

4.1.3.  CLA-Specific Definitions

   Within this document, objects that are referred to as 'CLA-Specific'
   are those objects which relate to a specific CLA in respect to the
   managed Node.  CLA-Specific objects are maintained within a
   conceptual table (with the exception of bpClaCount).  The following
   objects fall under this category:

   o  Denotation of the CL type (e.g.  UDP, TCP, LTP, etc) used by the
      CLA (bpClType)

   o  A human-readable name for the CLA assigned by the management agent
      (bpClaDisplayName)

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                  May 2011


   o  A unique identifier for a specific CLA's MIB instance (bpClID)

   o  The number of Bundles passed up/down the protocol stack from this
      CLA, to/from this BPA (bpClInBndls and bpClOutBndls)

   o  The number of Bytes passed up/down the protocol stack from this
      CLA, to/from this BPA (bpClInBytes and bpClOutBytes) and

   o  Denotation of the CLA's transmission direction (bpClaDirection)

   Each of these objects are detailed more precisely in the MIB's
   description fields.

4.2.  Design Decisions

   This section contains information regarding certain design choices
   made during the creation of the BP-MIB module.  Each decision was
   made keeping in mind certain assumptions regarding the circumstances
   under which a DTN might commonly operate.  These assumptions include:

   o  Low-powered equipment is likely to be used

   o  Limitations on long-term and (possibly) short-term storage are
      likely to exist and

   o  Delayed communication might require dissimilar management
      techniques from those used in timely environments

4.2.1.  Node and Endpoint Representation

   The first design decision involved the overall representation of
   Nodes and their respective attributes.  According to section 3.1 of
   RFC 5050 [RFC5050], Nodes have a M:N relationship with Endpoints.
   That is to say, a Node can be a member of multiple Endpoints and (as
   long as it is not a Singleton Endpoint) an Endpoint can have multiple
   Nodes register it.  Since SMIv2 [RFC2578] does not allow for the
   creation of three-dimensional conceptual tables, a normalized view of
   this relationship would require a mediating table or a method of
   simulating a three-dimensional conceptual table.  The method used
   here, as exhibited in section 5 of this document, was to simulate a
   three-dimensional conceptual table by having each instance of the BP-
   MIB contain managed information for a single Node - with each
   instance having a conceptual table that contains managed information
   for each Endpoint of which the Node is a member.

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                  May 2011


4.2.2.  Extension Blocks

   Bundle Protocol Extension Blocks are mentioned in RFC 5050 [RFC5050],
   but are not defined there.  The BP-MIB contains a set of Node-
   Specific objects that act as the list of Extensions Blocks that are
   available to the managed Node.  These objects are arranged as a
   conceptual table that is indexed by the IANA defined Extension Block
   number (represented by bpExtBlockType).  Also contained within the
   table is an OCTET STRING that acts as a human readable description of
   the table entry.

4.2.3.  Convergence Layer Adapters

   With the Node/Endpoint decision made, the next decision involved the
   representation of CLAs.  Since multiple Nodes can share the use of
   CLAs, and since the characteristics of a CLA are implementation
   dependent, few objects were placed within the bpClaTable.  Since it
   is likely that a CLA's managed objects (those stored in a MIB
   designed specifically for the management of the given CLA type) will
   maintain more specific information than that contained in the
   bpClaTable, two objects were created as a way to reference a CLA's
   MIB instance.  These two objects are:

   o  bpClType - Identifies the type of Convergence Layer (CL) being
      used by the CLA (e.g.  UDP, TCP, LTP, or otherwise)

   o  bpClID - Uniquely identifies the instance of managed information
      for the underlying CL whose type is defined by bpClType

   The bpClType and bpClID objects are also used as a solution to a
   specific design goal.  This goal involves the ability to trace
   managed information down the protocol stack and is discussed in more
   detail in section 4.2.3 of this document.

4.2.4.  Managing the Protocol Stack

   One of this MIB's primary goals is to enable managed information to
   be traceable throughout the protocol stack.  Ultimately, this goal is
   achieved by creating either a direct or indirect reference to an
   entry in the ifTable [RFC2863].  To make this possible, the BP-MIB
   MUST have identifier(s) that can be used to reference the MIB
   instance of the layer beneath itself.  The BP-MIB is designed in such
   a way that both direct and indirect references to an ifTable entry
   can be achieved.  This was done by placing two objects within the
   bpClaTable: one that uniquely identifies the CL type (bpClType) and
   one that uniquely identifies an instance of managed information for
   the given type (bpClID).  Direct references to an ifTable entry are
   achieved by setting bpClType = 1 (which means it is referring to an

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                  May 2011


   interface).  Indirect references are achieved when referencing a CLA
   MIB which, in turn, references the layer beneath itself.

   bpClType SHOULD be a standardized numeric value that identifies the
   type of Convergence Layer being used by the Convergence Layer
   Adapter.  This object is discussed more in section 4.2.4 of this
   document; giving rationale to the need for number standardization.

   bpClID, alternatively, is an arbitrary value chosen by the agent that
   uniquely identifies an instance of the MIB whose type is given by
   bpClType.  The NMS responsible for the managed information can use
   this value to determine the OID of the desired CLA.

   Currently, the MIB module defines the bpClType object to be an
   integer.  This design decision needs reconsideration however.  For
   readability and ease of use, a textual-convention would likely be a
   better choice for the object syntax.

   There are two objects in the bpClaTable that represent the number of
   Bundles passed into the BPA and out through the underlying CL
   (bpClInBndls and bpClOutBndls).  Likewise, two additional objects
   exist to represent the amount of data passed between layers
   (bpClInBytes and bpClOutBytes).  Though these values are not used for
   stack traversal, they are maintained as a way of offering a view of
   Bundle activity to/from the BP layer for each CLA.

4.2.5.  bpClType Number Standardization

   In sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 of this document, the use of bpClType was
   discussed.  Using such an object, however, could result in
   inconsistencies across implementations of BP software.  To avoid
   this, the BP-MIB uses a pre-defined set of numeric values, each
   uniquely representing a CL type.

4.2.6.  Reason for bpClaDirection

   The value in knowing the direction of data flow can be found in the
   use of certain equipment types.  Satellites, for instance, are prone
   to utilizing an up-link that is different from the down-link.
   Scenarios similar to this are likely to result in the creation of two
   separate CLA MIB instances - one for each link.  In these cases, a
   manager might desire knowing whether the underlying CL is capable of
   transmitting unidirectional traffic or bidirectional traffic.  To
   represent this, the bpClaTable has been given the bpClaDirection
   object.  The possible settings are inBound, outBound or
   biDirectional.

4.2.7.  Notifications

   In an attempt to keep things modular, TRAP and INFORM objects have
   been left out of the BP-MIB.  These objects SHOULD be designed in a
   separate MIB module which, if used, MUST be implemented in
   conjunction with the BP-MIB.  Since the requirements of network
   management within a DTN are distinct from those in a timely
   environment, use of notifications might vary between DTN environments
   and timely environments.  With this in mind, careful consideration
   SHOULD be made when designing such objects.  This is discussed in
   more detail in section 4.3.3 of this document.

4.2.8.  Statistical and Trended Data

   Certain MIBs, such as those that manage high performance equipment,
   might contain mechanisms to store local data trends and simple
   statistical analysis.  Though DTNs aren't typically found in
   environments that require high-performance equipment, the need for
   such mechanisms might exist due to delay-related restraints.
   However, in an attempt to keep things modular, statistic-based
   objects and trending objects have been considered beyond the scope of
   the BP-MIB.  These objects, if any such objects are designed, SHOULD
   be put in a separate MIB module which MAY be implemented in
   conjunction with the BP-MIB, but can function independent of the BP-
   MIB.  Design considerations for local trending and statistical
   analysis are addressed in section 4.3.1 of this document.

4.3.  Considerations for Future Designers

   This section is dedicated to describing certain considerations that
   future designers of DTN-related MIBs SHOULD observe in the design
   process.  Section 4.3.1 gives a generic overview of DTN-related
   network management concepts and how they might apply to the design of
   DTN-related MIBs.  Sections 4.3.2 through 4.3.4 observe particular
   MIB types and describe how they can and SHOULD inter-relate with the
   BP-MIB.

   Though it's beyond the scope of this document to discuss DTN network
   management requirements, certain DTN network management issues SHOULD
   be considered in the design of DTN-related MIBs.  For this reason,
   this section contains a brief discussions that might introduce
   potential road-blocks to future designers.

4.3.1.  Delay/Disruption Entity Management

   DTN-related MIB designers SHOULD consider the environment(s) under
   which the MIB might be deployed.  Environment, as used here, refers
   to elements like: the storage capacity and processing power of the

   equipment being used; the frequency at which values might change in
   relation to the frequency at which they can be transmitted to an NMS;
   existing network management protocol capabilities and; whether best
   practices in timely networks apply or if distinctions ought to be
   made.  Additionally, designers SHOULD consider the level of diversity
   that potential environments might have from one another.  Not doing
   so limits scalability and increases complexity for future designers.

   In Delay / Disruption prone environments, high latency and periodic
   disconnection are likely to occur.  With this in mind, designers
   SHOULD use object types that reflect an object's nature - in regard
   to how frequently that object might change (e.g. how often a counter
   might roll back to 0).  Designers SHOULD also consider that certain
   desirable statistics or trends might be impossible to calculate in
   the same way they could be in a timely environment.  This might
   result in the need to calculate and store vsuch values on the managed
   entity.  Careful consideration SHOULD be given before using a MIB-
   based solution to this issue.  Not doing so limits scalability and
   increases complexity for future designers.

4.3.2.  CLA MIB Design

   As described in sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3, Convergence Layer Adapter
   MIBs will be needed for the management of information beyond what is
   offered by bpClaTable.  This section addresses the design of those
   MIBs and offers suggestions to the designers.

   Within the BP-MIB, the bpClaTable contains objects for each CLA the
   Node currently has access to.  Within this table, two objects were
   defined as a reference to the underlying CLA's managed objects.
   These objects (bpClType and bpClID) were described in detail in
   sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3.  This document RECOMMENDS that the design
   of CLA MIBs follow a similar pattern in order to preserve the goal of
   managing the protocol stack.  To achieve this, two things MUST be
   done on the part of the designer.  First, an object whose value can
   be referenced by bpClID needs to be placed somewhere within the CLA's
   MIB.  This object MUST be assigned an arbitrary, but unique, value
   for each instance of the object - however, the maintenance of
   uniqueness might be subject to software implementation rather than in
   the design of the MIB.  Second, object(s) that can be used to
   reference the layer beneath the CLA need to be created.  The exact
   method of doing this is beyond the scope of this document.

4.3.3.  Notification MIB Design

   Design of DTN-related TRAP and INFORM objects SHOULD take into
   account the environment(s) under which they might be deployed.  The
   level of variance one environment's conditions have to others' can be

   arbitrarily small or large.  For instance, delay, in one environment,
   could refer to a relatively short time span, such as 5 minutes,
   whereas other environments might consider delay as referring to days
   at a time.  TRAP and INFORM objects SHOULD NOT be designed as a
   solution to a single environment if they could reasonably be designed
   to encompass multiple environments.

   Because of the introduction of delay into the management process,
   designers SHOULD consider what is valuable to a management station
   relative to when that station will receive a notification.  Since DTN
   elements can be managed both locally and remotely, designers of
   notifications SHOULD consider whether the notification can be used in
   a timely or delayed environment.  To this same end, a designer SHOULD
   consider the ways (if any) a notifications can be made to serve both
   purposes.

4.3.4.  Extension Block MIB Design

   Extension blocks created for use with the Bundle Protocol are likely
   to contain characteristics not managed by the BP-MIB.  However, the
   management of information regarding these characteristics SHOULD
   reference the Node by which the extension block was processed.  There
   are two ways in which this MAY be done.  First, a designer could
   reference the Node by its bpNodeID value.  Second, since each Node is
   a member of at least one Singleton Endpoint, the Endpoint ID (EID)
   belonging to a Singleton of which the desired Node is a member can be
   used.  This document however, RECOMMENDS use of bpNodeID.  Use of a
   Singleton's EID could fail in cases where a Node is a member of
   multiple Singleton Endpoints.  As long as one other Singleton exists
   for the Node, it can unregister a Singleton Endpoint.  If the EID
   used to reference the Node belonged to the unregistered Singleton, a
   management stations would no longer be able to know which Node is
   related to the extension block information.

       DESCRIPTION
           "This MIB module was designed for the management of Bundle
           Protocol (BP) Nodes, for the Endpoints they are members of,
           and for Node <===> CLA relationships. This MIB is structured
           in a way that Node-Specific objects are arranged separately
           from Endpoint and CLA -Specific objects. Objects which are
           Endpoint or CLA -Specific are arranged in Conceptual Rows
           within their own, respective, Conceptual Tables. Further,
           each instance of this module's objects represents a single
           managed Node. This means that a separate instantiation of
           the BP-MIB's objects will be forged for each Node being
           managed by the system. The layout of the MIB is arranged in
           the following order:

           * Node-Specific Definitions
           * Endpoint-Specific Definitions
           * CLA-Specific Definitions
           * Conformance Requirements for the BP-MIB"

           interface between the Bundle Protocol Agent and an
           inter-network protocol suite. Each bpClaEntry contains a
           reference to the layer beneath the BPA or, worded
           differently, to its CL (Convergence Layer). It's the job of
           the bpClType object in each row to denote what type of
           protocol the CL is. If the underlying layer is not an
           inter-networking protocol, the bpClType is set to 1 (which
           signifies that it's an interface).

6.  Acknowledgements

   Extensive thanks is given to Hans Kruse, Dovel Myers, Gilbert Clark,
   Josh Schendel, and the family of Ohio University's Internetworking
   Research Group Laboratory for their contributions on the MIB's design
   and how it might inter-relate with other DTN-related MIBs.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This section has work to be done.  IANA considerations do include:
   the standardization of numbers to uniquely identify Convergence Layer
   types; creation of a Textual-Convention for bpClType; and creation of
   a Textual-Convention for bpExtBlockType.

8.  Security Considerations

   Though SNMPv3 is the current de facto standard of network management
   protocols, there is no guarantee that this will hold true in the DTN
   architecture.  With this in mind, any protocols used SHOULD consider,
   to the fullest feasible extent, the security measures used in SNMPv3.
   Those protocols SHOULD also consider those security considerations
   specifically listed in the following paragraphs.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

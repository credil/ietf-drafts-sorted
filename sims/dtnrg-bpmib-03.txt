1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                 July 2013


   This memo is submitted for consideration in, and possible adoption
   by, the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG).  It defines
   a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with
   network management protocols.  In particular it defines objects for
   managing information about a Bundle Node [RFC5050] - or simply a
   'Node' within the scope of this document.  More specifically, the
   manageable objects for such a Node include: Node- Specific
   information, registered Endpoint-Specific information, and generic
   CLA-Specific (Convergence Layer Adapter) information.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] was designed as part of the
   solution to issues encountered in Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN)
   environments [RFC4838], which are otherwise unsatisfied by the
   connection-oriented scheme used in today's Internet.  This memo
   contains the definitions for a Bundle Protocol MIB as well as
   rationale for certain implementation decisions.  Also contained in
   this memo is a section dedicated to considerations for future
   designers of DTN-related MIBs.  The MIB module defined in this memo
   contains object definitions for a single Node, for each Endpoint of
   which that Node is a member, and for the CLAs which that Node has
   access to use.

4.1.  Structure of the MIB Module

   Objects within the BP-MIB have been derived from definitions found in
   RFC 5050 [RFC5050].  The version of the MIB in this document was
   further informed by lessons learned during the implementation of
   network management instrumentation in the NASA ION implementation of
   DTN.  These objects are broken down into three main groups:

   o  Node-Specific Definitions

   o  Endpoint-Specific Definitions

   o  CLA-Specific Definitions

4.1.1.  Node-Specific Definitions

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                 July 2013


   Within this document, objects that are referred to as 'Node-Specific'
   are those objects which relate only to the Node being managed.  In
   other words, these objects do not relate to a Node's relationship
   with any other entity (i.e.  Endpoints and CLAs).  Each of the
   objects are detailed in the MIB definition's description fields.

   One item in this category requires further discussion: the object
   "bpNodeID" is defined as a string that uniquely identifies the node
   to the network management application.  RFC 5050 does not define such
   a unique node identifier.  At this time, each implementation will
   need to find a way to create a node id.  This draft recommends that
   any node that needs to be managed continuously over time adhere to
   the following:

   o  The node SHOULD register in a singleton endpoint created for the
      purpose of managing the node, with the endpoint id of this network
      management endpoint serving as the node id.

   o  The implementation SHOULD take steps to prevent the node from un-
      registering from the network management endpoint.

   o  The implementation SHOULD ensure that the id of the network
      management endpoint does not change across node re-initialization
      or restarts.

   o  The implementation SHOULD ensure that the node registers into the
      network management endpoint as part of the node initialization or
      restart.

4.1.2.  Endpoint-Specific Definitions

   Within this document, objects that are referred to as 'Endpoint-
   Specific' are those objects which relate to a specific Endpoint in
   respect to the managed Node.  In other words, the information managed
   by these objects are subject only to the Node's view of the Endpoint
   (e.g. the current state of the Endpoint is "active" according to this
   Node OR the number of Bundles this Node has received for this
   Endpoint is 42).  Endpoint-Specific objects are maintained within a
   conceptual table (with the exception of bpRegCount).

   Each of the objects are detailed in the MIB definition's description
   fields.

4.1.3.  CLA-Specific Definitions

   Within this document, objects that are referred to as 'CLA-Specific'
   are those objects which relate to a specific CLA in respect to the
   managed Node.  CLA-Specific objects are maintained within a
   conceptual table (with the exception of bpClaCount).

   Each of the objects are detailed in the MIB definition's description
   fields.  Two items need to be expanded on:

   o  bpClType: denotes of the CL type (e.g.  UDP, TCP, LTP, etc).  This
      document suggests an initial set of (integer) values for currently
      used CL types.  However, some for of registry will be required in
      the future.

   o  bpClID: a unique identifier (an octet string) for a specific CLA's
      MIB instance.  The creation of this string is implementation
      specific.  A network management implementation MUST treat this
      string as opaque and use it only in "is equal to" operations.

4.2.  Design Decisions

   This section contains information regarding certain design choices
   made during the creation of the BP-MIB module.  Each decision was
   made keeping in mind certain assumptions regarding the circumstances
   under which a DTN might commonly operate.  These assumptions include:

   o  Low-powered equipment is likely to be used

   o  Limitations on long-term and (possibly) short-term storage are
      likely to exist and

   o  Delayed communication might require dissimilar management
      techniques from those used in timely environments

4.2.1.  Node and Endpoint Representation

   The first design decision involved the overall representation of
   Nodes and their respective attributes.  According to section 3.1 of
   RFC 5050 [RFC5050], Nodes have a M:N relationship with Endpoints.
   That is to say, a Node can be a member of multiple Endpoints and (as
   long as it is not a Singleton Endpoint) an Endpoint can have multiple
   Nodes register it.  Since SMIv2 [RFC2578] does not allow for the
   creation of three-dimensional conceptual tables, a normalized view of
   this relationship would be required; leading to the use of mediating
   tables.  The method used here, as exhibited in the formal MIB of this
   document, was to emulate a three-dimensional conceptual table by
   having each instance of the BP-MIB contain managed information for a

   single Node - with each instance having a conceptual table containing
   managed information for each Endpoint of which it is a member.

4.2.2.  Extension Blocks

   Bundle Protocol Extension Blocks are mentioned in RFC 5050 [RFC5050],
   but are not defined there.  The BP-MIB contains a set of Node-
   Specific objects that act as the list of Extensions Blocks that are
   available to the managed Node.  These objects are arranged as a
   conceptual table that is indexed by the IANA defined Extension Block
   number (represented by bpExtBlockType).  Also contained within the
   table is an OCTET STRING that acts as a human readable description of
   the table entry.

4.2.3.  Convergence Layer Adapters

   With the Node/Endpoint decision made, the next decision involved the
   representation of CLAs.  Since multiple Nodes can share the use of
   CLAs, and since the characteristics of a CLA are implementation
   dependent, few objects were placed within the bpClaTable.  Since it
   is likely that a CLA's managed objects (those stored in a MIB
   designed specifically for the management of the given CLA type) will
   maintain more specific information than that contained in the
   bpClaTable, two objects were created as a way to reference a CLA's
   MIB instance.  These two objects are:

   o  bpClType - Identifies the type of Convergence Layer (CL) being
      used by the CLA (e.g.  UDP, TCP, LTP, or otherwise)

   o  bpClID - Uniquely identifies the instance of managed information
      for the underlying CL whose type is defined by bpClType

   The bpClType and bpClID objects are also used as a solution to a
   specific design goal.  This goal involves the ability to trace
   managed information down the protocol stack and is discussed in more
   detail in another section of this document.

4.2.4.  Conformance Groups

   We recognize that the network management needs of different DTN
   implementations will vary widely.  The design of a MIB must balance
   between capturing all relevant, and potentially useful data, while
   also being mindful of the processing, memory, and storage
   requirements created by the need to collect, store, and report values
   for the objects defined in the MIB.  For DTN, no one such balanced
   approach will cover all needs.

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                 July 2013


   The MIB defined here uses the concept of Conformance Groups to allow
   different implementation to select the collection of objects to
   instrument for, in a standardized way.  Two groups are mandatory:

   o  bpNodeInfoGroup: this group contains basic information identifying
      the node and its current state (such as available storage, and
      counts of queued bundles).

   o  bpNodeActivityGroup: this group contains counters that allow
      tracking of the number of bundles processed by the node.

   All objects not in the two groups above are optional.  These
   remaining objects are, however, grouped in (marked as optional)
   conformance groups to give network management applications more
   predictability as to the data that is available in a node
   implementation.

4.2.5.  Managing the Protocol Stack

   One of this MIB's primary goals is to enable managed information to
   be traceable throughout the protocol stack.  Ultimately, this goal is
   achieved by creating either a direct or indirect reference to an
   entry in the ifTable [RFC2863].  To make this possible, the BP-MIB
   MUST have identifier(s) that can be used to reference the MIB
   instance of the layer beneath itself.  The BP-MIB is designed in such
   a way that both direct and indirect references to an ifTable entry
   can be achieved.  This was done by placing two objects within the
   bpClaTable: one that uniquely identifies the CL type (bpClType) and
   one that uniquely identifies an instance of managed information for
   the given type (bpClID).  Direct references to an ifTable entry are
   achieved by setting bpClType = 1 (which means it is referring to an
   interface).  Indirect references are achieved when referencing a CLA
   MIB which, in turn, references the layer beneath itself.

   bpClType SHOULD be a standardized numeric value that identifies the
   type of Convergence Layer being used by the Convergence Layer
   Adapter.

   bpClID, alternatively, is an arbitrary value chosen by the agent that
   uniquely identifies an instance of the MIB whose type is given by
   bpClType.  The NMS responsible for the managed information can use
   this value to determine the OID of the desired CLA.

   There are two objects in the bpClaTable that represent the number of
   Bundles passed into the BPA and out through the underlying CL
   (bpClInBndls and bpClOutBndls).  Likewise, two additional objects
   exist to represent the amount of data passed between layers
   (bpClInBytes and bpClOutBytes).  Though these values are not used for

   stack traversal, they are maintained as a way of offering a view of
   Bundle activity to/from each CLA from the perspective of a node.

4.2.6.  Reason for bpClaDirection

   The value in knowing the direction of data flow can be found in the
   use of certain equipment types.  Spacecraft, for instance, are prone
   to utilizing an up-link that is different from the down-link.
   Scenarios similar to this are likely to result in the creation of two
   separate CLA MIB instances - one for each link.  In these cases, a
   manager might desire knowing whether the underlying CL is capable of
   transmitting unidirectional traffic or bidirectional traffic.  To
   represent this, the bpClaTable has been given the bpClaDirection
   object.  The possible settings are inBound, outBound or
   biDirectional.

4.2.7.  Notifications

   In an attempt to keep things modular, TRAP and INFORM objects have
   been left out of the BP-MIB.  These objects SHOULD be designed in a
   separate MIB module which, if used, MUST be implemented in
   conjunction with the BP-MIB.  Since the requirements of network
   management within a DTN are distinct from those in a timely
   environment, use of notifications may vary between DTN environments
   and timely environments.

4.2.8.  Statistical and Trended Data

   Certain MIBs, such as those that manage high performance equipment,
   might contain mechanisms to store local data trends, simple
   statistical analysis, and bulk data counters (to avoid losing data
   when a counter resets to 0).  The need for such mechanisms is likely
   to arise in certain DTN environments as well - but for different
   reasons.  MIBs for high-performance equipment are likely to
   experience incredibly high counter iteration (essentially causing the
   counters to rollover before an NMS can retrieve the stored values)
   whereas a DTN is likely to accrue large amounts of data between NMS
   requests due to the constraints imposed by delay and disruption.
   However, in an attempt to keep things modular, statistic-based
   objects and trending objects have been considered beyond the scope of
   the BP-MIB.  These objects, if any such objects are designed, SHOULD
   be put in a separate MIB module which MAY be implemented in
   conjunction with the BP-MIB, but can function independent of the BP-
   MIB.

           "This MIB module was designed for the management of Bundle
           Protocol (BP) Nodes, for the Endpoints they are members of,
           and for Node <===> CLA relationships. This MIB is structured
           in a way that Node-Specific objects are arranged separately
           from Endpoint and CLA -Specific objects. Objects which are
           Endpoint or CLA -Specific are arranged in Conceptual Rows
           within their own, respective, Conceptual Tables. Further,
           each instance of this module's objects represents a single
           managed Node. This means that a separate instantiation of
           the BP-MIB's objects will be forged for each Node being
           managed by the system. The layout of the MIB is arranged in
           the following order:

6.  Acknowledgments

   Extensive thanks is given to Dovel Myers, Gilbert Clark, Josh
   Schendel, and the family of Ohio University's Internetworking
   Research Group Laboratory for their contributions on the MIB's design
   and how it might inter-relate with other DTN-related MIBs.  Many of
   the more recent design changes in the MIB are based on input from
   Scott Burleigh at JPL and Ed Birraine at APL.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section has work to be done.  IANA considerations do include:
   the standardization of numbers to uniquely identify Convergence Layer
   types; creation of a Textual-Convention for bpClType; and creation of
   a Textual-Convention for bpExtBlockType.

8.  Security Considerations

   Though SNMPv3 is the current de facto standard of network management
   protocols, there is no guarantee that this will hold true in the DTN
   architecture.  With this in mind, any protocols used SHOULD consider,
   to the fullest feasible extent, the security measures used in SNMPv3.
   Design of such protocols SHOULD consider the lessons learned in the
   terrestrial Internet.  The following paragraphs address issues
   specific to SNMP, but may still hold relevance for DTN network
   management mechanisms.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

Internet-Draft             Bundle Protocol MIB                 July 2013


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

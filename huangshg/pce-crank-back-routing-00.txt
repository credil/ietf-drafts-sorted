Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol(PCEP)
                         for Crank-back Routing
                draft-huangshg-pce-crank-back-routing-00

Abstract

   Path computation in large multi-layer and multi-region networks is
   complex and may require special computational components and
   cooperation between different network domains, whereby a failure
   affect to establish a path or a failure of an existing path may be
   corrected by a new path computation and fresh signaling.  This
   document specifies the crank-back routing mechanism based on re-
   routing in crank back Path Computation Element (PCE).  When a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) requests a PCE for a route, it may be useful
   for the PCC to specify Crank-back routing to the path computation,
   abstract nodes, resources, and domains that are to be explicitly
   excluded from the computed route.  Such mechanism is termed Crank-
   back routing.  The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a
   communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs.  To support this
   mechanism, function of PCE and procedure of PCEP signaling
   performance are extended.

Internet-Draft   PCEP Extensions for Crank-back Routing     October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Crank-back routing is a mechanism whereby a failure affect to
   establish a path or a failure of an existing path may be corrected by
   a new path computation and fresh signaling.  Crank-back routing
   relies on the distribution of Crank-back information along with the
   failure notification so that the new computation can be performed
   avoiding the failure or blockage point.  In the context of Path
   Computation Element (PCE), Crank-back information may be passed back
   to the head-end where the process of computation and signaling can be
   repeated using the failed resource as an exclusion in the computation
   process.  But Crank-back may be used to attempt to correct the
   problem at intermediate points along the path.  Such Crank-back re-
   computation nodes are most likely to be domain boundaries where the
   Path Computation Client (PCC) had already invoked a PCE.  Thus, a
   failure within a domain is reported to the ingress domain boundary,
   which will attempt to compute an alternate path across the domain.
   Finishing this, the problem may be reported to the previous domain
   and communicated to the ingress boundary for that domain, which may
   attempt to select a more successful path either by choosing a
   different entry point into the next domain, or by selecting a route
   through a different set of domains.

4.   Motivation for a Crank-back Routing

   Several motivations for a Crank-back Routing are listed below.It
   should be highlighted that the aim of this section is to provide some
   application examples for which a Crank-back Routing may be suitable:
   this also clearly states that such a model does not aim to replace
   existing path computation models but would apply to specific existing
   or future situations.As can be seen from these examples, Crank-back
   does not replace the existing Internet model where intelligence is
   distributed within the network.  Instead, it builds on this model and
   makes use of distributed centers of information or computational
   ability.


5.  Protocol Procedures and Extensions

   This section describes the procedures adopted by a PCE handling a
   request for Crank-back routing computation with resources or domain
   exclusions received from a PCC, and defines how those exclusions are
   encoded.There are three types of resources or domain exclusion
   described in. 1.  Exclusion of certain abstract nodes or resources
   from the specific domain. 2.  Exclusion of certain domain from the
   whole path.3.  Include of the original LSP.When a specific Label
   Switched Paths across several domains and the resource in a specific
   domain collapse, the first step is that the failure notification will
   send to the head PCE and this PCE calculation a another LSP path
   avoiding the failure resource across the domain.  If the PCE can!_t
   find the suitable LSP in the failure domain, the Crank-back routing
   request will dispatch to the previous domain and the PCE in the
   previous domain is responsible for path calculation.This document
   defines protocol extensions to allow a PCC to specify both types of
   resources or domain exclusions and original LSP inclusions to a PCE
   on a path computation request and allow a PCE to specify domain
   exclusions and original LSP inclusions to another PCE on a path
   computation request.  A new PCEP object, the Exclude Domain Object
   (XDO), is defined to convey the Exclude Domain List.  Include LSP
   Object (ILO) is defined to convey the original LSP.  The existing
   Include Route Object (IRO) in PCEP [RFC5440] and Exclude Route Object
   (XRO) in PCEP [RFC5521] is modified by introducing a new IRO sub-
   object and a new XRO sub-object to convey Explicit Domain Exclusions
   and the original LSP.

5.1.  Exclude Domain Object (XDO) and Include LSP Object (ILO)

   Crank-back routing is based on the retrace point-based mechanism.
   Turn point do not send a path error message to upstream PCE, but
   reverting directly to the destination node for the residential, so
   that the connection re-routing, and establish the connection.

Internet-Draft   PCEP Extensions for Crank-back Routing     October 2010


   If a label switching path fail because of link or node failure, a new
   request will again request to PCE to repair label switched path,
   because the PCC did not know the TED has been updated, the new path
   request is request to carry these messages.  If you want to use the
   resources of the original LSP as a new request will have an
   advantage.  Therefore, path computation request message must be
   permitted to identify the requested LSP path is restored, must also
   support the inclusion of the original LSP and already failed element.

   A network failure may affect a lot of LSPs, in this case, there will
   be a lot of PCCs would like to request PCE at the same time.
   Different levels of LSP will retrace the route using different
   methods, so that the high-priority LSP would be rapidly recovered.
   In order to achieve this approach, you must set he appropriate level
   for each LSP in the PCE and configure the appropriate strategy to
   accomplish this task.

   Crank-back routing route can also be used to realize the TE LSP re-
   optimization, in the new route request contains the original routing
   path information that will help PCE to avoid double counting to
   reduce bandwidth congestion issue.

   The XDO and ILO are carried within Path Computation Request (PCReq)
   and Path Computation Reply (PCRep) messages.  When present in a PCReq
   message, the XRO provides a list of network domains that the PCE is
   requested to exclude from the path that it compute, the ILO provides
   the original LSP that the PCE use to compute a new path containing
   most of the normal running equipment in the original LSP.  Flags
   associated with each list member instruct the PCE as to whether the
   domain must be excluded from the computed path and whether the
   partial LSP must be included in the computed path.  The XDO MAY be
   used on a CRep message that carries the NO-PATH object (i.e., one
   that reports a path computation failure) to indicate the set of
   elements of the original XDO that prevented the PCE from finding a
   path.  The XDO MAY also be used on a PCRep message for a successful
   path computation when the PCE wishes to provide a set of exclusions
   to be signaled during LSP setup using the extensions to Resource
   Reservation Protocol (RSVP)-TE [RFC4874].  XDO Body Format is in
   accordance with the Exclude Route Object (XRO) in PCEP [RFC5521].

   Include LSP Object (ILO) defines network elements that must not or
   should not be used on the path between two PCE.  This information is
   encoded by defining a new sub-object for the ILO.  The new ILO sub-
   object has type 33.  The ILO contains one or more sub-objects in its
   own right.  An ILO must not be sent without sub-objects, and if
   received with no sub-objects, must be ignored.The format of the ILO
   is as follows:

   receipt.  The ILO sub-object may carry any of the sub-objects defined
   for inclusion in the ILO by this document or by future documents.
   The meanings of the fields of the ILO sub-object are unchanged when
   the sub-object are included in an ILO.

5.2.  Relationship to Signaling

   The inter-domain TE LSP is limited by the signaling methods supported
   on the intermediate nodes.  It is usually the domain border nodes
   where this restriction applies since other transit nodes are
   oblivious to the crank-back mechanism in use.  The ingress of the LSP
   may further restrict the choice by setting parameters in the Path
   message when it is signaled.  Determine the signaling method to be
   used to cross the domain.  If the ingress node of the inter-domain TE
   LSP has specified crank-back restrictions on the methods to be used,
   these must be adhered to.  Within the freedom allowed by the ingress
   node, the domain border node may choose any method according to local
   configuration and policies.


6.   Practical application

6.1.  Single PCE path computation Environment

   In "single PCE path computation", a single PCE is used to compute a
   given path in a domain.  All LSPs are computed by the single PCE and
   this PCE make it best effort to find another appropriate LSP when it
   receive crank-back request which include the XRO and ILO objects, if
   this PCE can not find the needed LSP, a crank-back request include
   the XDO and ILO objects is send to the previous domain.

Internet-Draft   PCEP Extensions for Crank-back Routing     October 2010


6.2.  Multiple PCE path computation Environment

   In "multiple PCE path computation", multiple PCEs are used to compute
   a given path in a domain.  In this case, when a PCE send Path
   Computation Request(PCReq) messages to another PCE and this PCE
   compute the needed partial path for Previous PCE.  After the network
   run for a period of time, there is a node or link failure in the path
   which is computed by current PCE, the failure notification is send to
   the current PCE and the current PCE will make the greatest efforts to
   compute another path.  If the current PCE can!_t find the appropriate
   path, the Path Computation Request (PCReq) messages including the XRO
   and ILO objects send to previous PCE, this process continue to
   execute until the PCE can find the appropriate path to the
   destination.  If all the PCE in this domain can!_t find the
   appropriate path, the Path Computation Request (PCReq) messages
   including the XDO and ILO objects send to a PCE which exist in
   previous domain.  The PCE in the previous domain will choose another
   gateway node or choose another domain to establish the LSP.

6.3.  Centralized computation model Environment

   "Centralized computation model" refers to a model whereby all paths
   in a domain are computed by a single, centralized PCE.  There may be
   multiple PCEs in a domain, but only one PCE per domain is involved in
   any single path computation.  Because there is only one PCE
   participate in the LSP compute, the Crank-back routing request will
   be send to the arbitrary PCE and the Path Computation Request (PCReq)
   messages include the XRO and ILO objects.

6.4.  Distributed computation model Environment

   "Distributed computation model" refers to the computation of paths in
   a domain being shared among multiple PCEs.  Paths that span multiple
   domains may be computed using the distributed model with one or more
   PCEs responsible for each domain, or the centralized model by
   defining a domain that encompasses all the other domains.  From these
   definitions, a centralized computation model inherently uses single
   PCE path computation.  However, a distributed computation model could
   use either single PCE path computation or multiple PCE path
   computations.  There would be no such thing as a centralized model
   that uses multiple PCEs.


7.  Security Considerations

   Crank-back Routing may raise new security issues when PCE-PCE
   communication is done between different region networks for inter-
   region path computation.  Security issues may also exist when a

   single PCE is granted full visibility of TE information that applies
   to multiple areas.

   It is expected that solutions for inter-region protocol extensions
   will address these issues in detail using security techniques such as
   authentication.

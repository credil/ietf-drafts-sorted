Internet-Draft            RFC 1142 to historic                  May 2011


1.  Introduction

   IS-IS is the "OSI Intermediate system to Intermediate system intra-
   domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction
   with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode Network
   Service (ISO 8473)", otherwise known as ISO/IEC 10589.  It has been
   extended for use with IP by RFC 1195[RFC1195] and subsequently
   enhanced by many other RFCs.

   RFC 1142[RFC1142] was a republication of ISO DP 10589 originally
   provided as a service to the Internet community.  However, ISO DP
   10589 was an ISO "Draft Proposal" which differed in a considerable
   number of significant respects from the final standardised version
   published as ISO/IEC 10589[ISO10589-First-Edition], and subsequently
   revised as ISO/IEC 10589 second edition[ISO10589-Second-Edition].  It
   has been an ongoing source of confusion when RFC 1142 has been
   unwittingly quoted or referenced in place of ISO/IEC 10589 itself.

   All references to IS-IS should be to ISO/IEC 10589:2002, Second
   Edition and RFC 1142 is only of historic interest.


2.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


3.  Security Considerations

   Reclassifying RFC 1142 has no security considerations.

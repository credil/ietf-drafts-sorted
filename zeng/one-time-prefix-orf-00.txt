Abstract  

   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for 
   BGP, termed "One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", which 
   would allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh 
   request with a set of address-prefix-based filters to make the peer 
   re-advertise only the specific routes matching the filters to the 
   speaker. This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to recover some 
   specific "problematic" routes without requiring its peer to re-
   advertise the whole Adj-RIB-Out of specific address family, which 
   makes the trouble shooting operation (such as packets tracking) more 
   efficient and reduces the impact on network stability. This filter 
   does not change the outbound route filters on BGP peers and should 
   only be used for one-time filtering.

   1. Introduction 

   The Outbound Route Filtering Capability defined in [RFC5291] 
   provides a mechanism for a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a set 
   of Outbound Route Filters (ORFs) that can be used by its peer to 
   filter its outbound routing updates to the speaker.  

   During some network maintenance, BGP speaker only needs to retrieve 
   some specific "problematic" routes from its peer if the routes are 
   possibly lost or contain some problematic attributes for some reason, 
   but send ROUTE-REFRESH will lead to the peer re-advertising its 
   whole Adj-RIB-Out. Such large numbers of updates include a lot of 
   unnecessary routes which would make trouble shooting operation (such

   as packets tracking) more difficult, and is a waste of processing 
   resources and bandwidth. Even configured with ORF mechanism as 
   defined in [RFC5291], on receipt of a ROUTE-REFRESH message, the 
   peer will re-advertise all the routes matching current outbound 
   route filters, i.e., the whole Adj-Rib-Out for this BGP speaker. 
   Since in this case the BGP speaker does not want to change the 
   outbound route filters on its peer, this problem cannot be solved by 
   current ORF mechanism.  

   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for 
   BGP, termed "One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", which 
   would allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh 
   request with a set of address-prefix-based filters to make the peer 
   re-advertise only the specific routes matching the filters to the 
   speaker. This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to recover some 
   specific "problematic" routes without requiring its peer to re-
   advertise the whole Adj-RIB-Out of specific address family, which 
   makes the trouble shooting operation (such as packets tracking) more 
   efficient and reduces the impact on network stability. This filter 
   does not change the outbound route filters on BGP peers and should 
   only be used for one-time filtering. 

   2. One-time Address Prefix ORF-Type 

   This document defines a new ORF type: One-time Address Prefix ORF. 

   As specified in the [RFC5291], an ORF entry is a tuple of the form 
   <AFI/SAFI, ORF-Type, Action, Match, ORF-value> an ORF consists of 
   one or more ORF entries that have a common AFI/SAFI and ORF-Type. An 
   ORF is identified by <AFI/SAFI, ORF-Type>. 

   The format of One-time Address Prefix ORF-Type entry is the same as 
   the encoding of Address Prefix ORF in [RFC5292], the specific fields 
   are defined as follows: 

   Since the semantics of this new ORF-Type is always "one-time 
   filtering" and has no impact on existing ORFs, so the Action field 
   MUST be ignored. 

   The matching rules of the One-time Address Prefix ORF are the same 
   as defined in Address-Prefix-Based ORF [RFC-5292]. 

   The ORF entries of this type are used as one-time filters that MUST 
   not change any previously installed ORF entry on the remote peer.

   3. Operation 

   The capability negotiation of <AFI/SAFI, One-time Address Prefix 
   ORF> MUST NOT delay the advertisement of routes with this AFI/SAFI. 

   The received One-time Address Prefix ORF entries SHOULD only be used 
   for one-time route filtering and MUST NOT be saved locally. The 
   received One-time Address Prefix ORF entries MUST NOT modify the 
   outbound route filters on the receiver (either locally configured or 
   received from peer through ORF). 

   On receipt of ROUTE-REFRESH message with One-time Address Prefix ORF 
   entries, the receiver SHOULD re-advertise to the peer the routes 
   from the Adj-RIB-Out associated with the peer which pass the entries 
   carried in the One-time Address Prefix ORF and taking into account 
   the locally saved ORFs (if any) received from the peer. 

   4. Security Considerations 

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues 
   in [RFC4271]. 

   5. IANA Considerations 

   This document specifies a new Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) type, 
   One-time Address-Prefix ORF. The value of the ORF-type needs to be 
   assigned by the IANA.

     Combined Use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
           Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (CUSAX)
                        draft-ivov-xmpp-cusax-02

Abstract

   This document describes current practices for combined use of the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and
   Presence Protocol (XMPP).  Such practices aim to provide a single
   fully featured real-time communication service by using complementary
   subsets of features from each of the protocols.  Typically such
   subsets would include telephony capabilities from SIP and instant
   messaging and presence capabilities from XMPP.  This specification
   does not define any new protocols or syntax for either SIP or XMPP.
   However, implementing it may require modifying or at least
   reconfiguring existing client and server-side software.  Also, it is
   not the purpose of this document to make recommendations as to
   whether or not such combined use should be preferred to the
   mechanisms provided natively by each protocol like for example SIP's
   SIMPLE or XMPP's Jingle.  It merely aims to provide guidance to those
   who are interested in such a combined use.

Internet-Draft        Combined Use of SIP and XMPP          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Historically SIP [RFC3261] and XMPP [RFC6120] have often been
   implemented and deployed with different purposes: from its very start
   SIP's primary goal has been to provide a means of conducting
   "Internet telephone calls".  XMPP on the other hand, has, from its
   Jabber days, been mostly used for instant messaging and presence
   [RFC6121], as well as related services such as groupchat rooms
   [XEP-0045].

   For various reasons, these trends have continued through the years
   even after each of the protocols had been equipped to provide the
   features it was initially lacking:

   o  Today, in the context of the SIMPLE working group, the IETF has
      defined a number of protocols and protocol extensions that not
      only allow for SIP to be used for regular instant messaging and
      presence but that also provide mechanisms for elaborated features
      such as multi-user chats, server-stored contact lists, file
      transfer and others.
   o  Similarly, the XMPP community and the XMPP Standards Foundation
      have worked on defining a number of XMPP Extension Protocols
      (XEPs) that provide XMPP implementations with the means of
      establishing end-to-end sessions.  These extensions are often
      jointly referred to as Jingle and their arguably most popular use
      case are audio and video calls.

   Despite these advances, SIP remains the protocol of choice for
   telephony-like services, especially in enterprises where users are
   accustomed to features such as voice mail, call park, call queues,
   conference bridges and many others that are rarely (if at all)
   available in Jingle-based software.  XMPP implementations, on the
   other hand, greatly outnumber and outperform those available for
   instant messaging and presence extensions developed in the SIMPLE WG,
   such as MSRP [RFC4975] and XCAP [RFC4825].

   For these reasons, in a number of cases adopters have found
   themselves needing a set of features that are not offered by any
   single-protocol solution but that separately exist in SIP and XMPP
   products.  The idea of seamlessly using both protocols together would
   hence often appeal to service providers.

   Most often the combined use of SIP and XMPP ("CUSAX") would employ
   SIP exclusively for audio, video, and telephony services and rely on
   XMPP for anything else varying from chat, contact list management,
   and presence to whiteboarding and exchanging files.

   This document explains how such hybrid offerings can be achieved with

   a minimum of modifications to existing software while providing an
   optimal user experience.  It tries to cover points such as server
   discovery, determining a SIP AOR while using XMPP and determining an
   XMPP Jabber Identifier ("JID") from incoming SIP requests.  Most of
   the text here pertains to client behavior but it also recommends
   certain server-side configurations.

   Note that this document is focused on coexistence of SIP and XMPP
   functionality in end-user-oriented clients.  By intent it does not
   define methods for protocol-level mapping between SIP and XMPP, as
   might be used within a server-side gateway between a SIP network and
   an XMPP network.  A separate series of documents has been produced
   that defines such mappings.


2.  Client Bootstrap

   One of the main problems of using two distinct protocols when
   providing one service is the effect on usability.  E-mail services,
   for example, have long been affected by the mixed use of SMTP for
   outgoing mail and POP3 or IMAP for incoming mail, making it rather
   complicated for inexperienced users to configure a mail client and
   start using it with a new service.  As a result, Internet service
   providers often need to provide configuration instructions for
   various mail clients.  Client developers and communication device
   manufacturers on the other hand often ship with a number of wizards
   that enable users to easily set up a new account for a number of
   popular e-mail services.  While this may improve the situation to
   some extent, the user experience is still clearly sub-optimal.

   While it should be possible for CUSAX users to manually configure
   their separate SIP and XMPP accounts, dual-stack SIP/XMPP clients
   ought to provide means of online provisioning.  While the specifics
   of such mechanisms are outside the scope of this specification, they
   should make it possible for a service provider to remotely configure
   the clients based on minimal user input (e.g., only a user ID and
   password).

   Because many of the features that a CUSAX client would privilege in
   one protocol would also be available in the other, clients should
   make it possible for such features to be disabled for a specific
   account.  In particular, it is suggested that clients allow for
   audio/video calling features to be disabled for XMPP accounts.
   Additionally, instant messaging and presence features should also be
   made optional for SIP accounts.

   The main advantage of the above would be that clients would be able
   to continue to function properly and use the complete feature set of

Internet-Draft        Combined Use of SIP and XMPP          October 2012


   stand-alone SIP and XMPP accounts.

   Once client bootstrap has completed, clients need to log in
   independently to the SIP and XMPP accounts that make up the CUSAX
   "service" and then maintain both these connections.  In order to
   improve user experience, when reporting connection status clients may
   also wish to present the CUSAX XMPP connection as an "instant
   messaging" or a "chat" account.  Similarly they could also depict the
   SIP CUSAX connection as a "Voice and Video" or a "Telephony"
   connection.  The exact naming is of course entirely up to
   implementers.  The point is that, in cases where SIP and XMPP are
   components of a service offered by a single provider, such
   presentation could help users better understand why they are being
   shown two different connections for what they perceive as a single
   service.  It could alleviate especially situations where one of these
   connections is disrupted while the other one is successfully
   maintained.


3.  Operation

   Once a CUSAX client has been provisioned/configured to connect to the
   corresponding SIP and XMPP services it would proceed by retrieving
   its XMPP roster.  In order for CUSAX to function properly, XMPP
   service administrators should make sure that at least one of the
   vCard [RFC6350] "tel" fields for each contact is properly populated
   with a SIP URI or a phone number when an XMPP protocol for vCard
   storage (e.g., [XEP-0054] or [XEP-0292]) is used.  There are no
   limitations as to the form of that number (e.g. it does not need to
   respect any equivalence with the XMPP JID).  However, it ought to be
   reachable through the SIP aspect of this CUSAX service.

   To ensure that the foregoing approach is always respected, service
   providers might consider (1) preventing clients (and hence users)
   from modifying the vCard "tel" fields or (2) applying some form of
   validation before recording changes.  Of course such validation would
   be feasible mostly in cases where one single provider controls both
   the XMPP and the SIP service since such providers would "know" (e.g.,
   based on use of a common user database for both services) what SIP
   AOR corresponds to a given XMPP user.

   When rendering the XMPP roster CUSAX clients should make sure that
   users are presented with a "Call" option for each roster entry that
   has a properly set "tel" field even if calling has been disabled for
   that particular XMPP account.  The usefulness of such a feature is
   not limited to CUSAX.  After all, numbers are entered in vCards in
   order to be dialed and called.  Hence, as long as an XMPP client is
   equipped with accounts that have calling features it may wish to

Internet-Draft        Combined Use of SIP and XMPP          October 2012


   present the user with the option of using these accounts to reach
   numbers from an XMPP vCard.  In order to improve usability, in cases
   where clients are provisioned with only a single telephony-capable
   account they ought to do so immediately upon user request without
   asking for confirmation.  This way CUSAX users whose only account
   with calling capabilities would often be the SIP part of their
   service, would have a better user experience.  If on the other hand,
   the CUSAX client is aware of multiple telephony-capable accounts, it
   ought to present the user with the choice of reaching the phone
   number through any of them (including the source XMPP account where
   the vCard was obtained) in order to guarantee proper operation for
   XMPP accounts that are not part of a CUSAX deployment.

   In addition to discovering phone numbers from vCards, clients may
   also check presence broadcasts and the appropriate Personal Eventing
   Protocol nodes as described in XEP-0152: Reachability Addresses
   [XEP-0152].

   The client should use XMPP for all other forms of communication with
   the contacts from its roster, which will occur naturally because they
   were retrieved through XMPP and only voice/video features were
   disabled in the XMPP stack.

   When receiving SIP calls, clients may wish to determine the identity
   of the caller and bind it to a roster entry so that users could
   revert to chatting or other forms of communication that require XMPP.
   To do so clients could search their roster for an entry whose vCard
   has a "tel" field matching the originator of the call.

   An alternate mechanism would be for CUSAX clients to add to their SIP
   invite requests a Contact header containing the XMPP URI
   corresponding to their JID as per [RFC5122].


4.  Federation

   An alternate mechanism would be for CUSAX clients to add to


5.  Security Considerations

   Use of the same user agent with two different accounts providing
   complementary features introduces the possibility of mismatches
   between the security profiles of those accounts or features.  For
   example, the SIP aspect and XMPP aspect of the CUSAX service might
   offer different authentication options (e.g., digest authentication
   for SIP as specified in [RFC3261] and SCRAM authentication [RFC5802]
   for XMPP as specified in [RFC6120]).  Similarly, a CUSAX client might

   successfully negotiate Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] when
   connecting to the XMPP aspect of the service but not when connecting
   to the SIP aspect.  Such mismatches could introduce the possibility
   of downgrade attacks.  User agent developers and service providers
   ought to ensure that such mismatches are avoided as much as possible.

   Refer to the specifications for the relevant SIP and XMPP features
   for detailed security considerations applying to each "stack" in a
   CUSAX client.

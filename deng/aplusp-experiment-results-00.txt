    1. Introduction 

       A+P [draft-ymbk-aplusp-09] is a technique to share IPv4 addresses 
       during the IPv6 transition period without requiring a NAT function in 
       the provider's network. The main idea of A+P is treating some bits 
       from the port number in the TCP/UDP header as additional end point 
       identifiers to extend the address field, thereby leaving a range of 
       ports available to applications. This feature facilitates migration 
       of networks to IPv6-only while offering the IPv4 connectivity ervices 
       to customers, because the IPv4 address and the significant bits from 
       the port range can be encoded in an IPv6 address and therefore 
       transporting IPv4 traffic over IPv6 network by stateless IPv6 
       routing.  

       We have implemented A+P in a residential ADSL access network, where 
       IPv6-only access network is provided over PPPoE. In this document, we 
       describe the implementation environment including A+P IPv6 prefix 
       format and network elements configurations, and results of 
       application tests as well. The document focuses on the implementation 
       of the SMAP function specified in [draft-ymbk-aplusp-09]: 

       o Implement DHCPv6 options to retrieve an IPv4-embedded IPv6 address 
          and a port range. 

       o Support of those DHCPv6 options in both the DHCPv6 server side and 
          the DHCPv6 client side. 

       o Support of those DHCPv6 options in both the DHCPv6 server side and 
          the DHCPv6 client side. 

       For extensive application tests results in A+P environment, please 
       refer to [draft-boucadair-behave-bittorrent-portrange-02] and [draft-
       boucadair-port-range-01].

       We had developed both A+P home gate way function and Port Range 
       Router (PRR) function on Linux platform and ported the home gate way 
       function to a Linksys wrt 54G CPE, on which an openwrt 2.6.32 (based 
       on Linux kernel) is running. 

       Figure 2 shows the Parameters of A+P CPE. IPv6 is provisioning over 
       PPPoE to CPE while DHCPv6 server offers IPv6 prefix and A+P 
       parameters by extended options defined in [draft-boucadair-dhcpv6-
       shared-address-option].

    3.2. Implementation and Configuration  

       Aplusp CPE, using Netfilter framework, the IPv4 port restricted NAT 
       operation performed by CPE has been implemented by simply rules 
       through iptables tool on Linux. After the port restriceted NAT 
       operation, the IPv4 packets are sent to a TUN interface which is 
       described as a virtual network interface in Linux. Using the IPv4-
       Embedded IPv6 address format defined in section 3.2.1, an IPv4-in-
       IPv6 encapsulation/decapsulation is performed by the TUN interface 
       handler.  

       PRR, located in the interconnection point of the IPv6 network and 
       IPv4 network, has been implemented with two main functions: 1) IPv4-
       in-IPv6 encapsulation/decapsulation; Like CPE, TUN driver is also 
       used in PRR to achieve function IPv4-in-IPv6 
       encapsulation/decapsulation. 2) destination port based routing 
       function, which is responsible for routing the IPv4 traffic 
       originated from the IPv4 Internet to the Port Range restricted A+P 
       CPE. Destination port based routing is implemented by generating IPv6 
       destination address, pre-assigned from IPv4 address and port range to 
       each CPE, according to IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address format defined in 
       section 3.2.1.

       To facilitate test and experiment on AplusP solution, recently, we 
       are considering release this AplusP implementation under open source 
       license. For more implementation details, please refer to 
       [Implementing A+P] 

    3.2.2. DHCPv6 Configurations 

           

       DHCPv6 options defined in [draft-boucadair-dhcpv6-shared-address-
       option] have been implemented. These options allow to configure a 
       shared address together with a port range using DHCPv6. 

    3.2.3. Avoiding Fragmentation 

     

       Normally the TCP protocol stack will employ Maximum Segment Size 
       (MSS) negotiation and/or Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery 
       (PMTUD) to determine 

       the maximum packet size, and then try to send as large as possible 
       datagram to achieve better throughput. However the IPv4-in-IPv6 
       encapsulation and the PPPoE header is very likly to cause a larger 
       packet that exceeds the maximum MTU of the wire, and result in 
       undesired fragmentation processing and decrease transmission 
       efficiency. 

       A simple solution is to enable iptables on A+P CPE to modify the MSS 
       value of TCP session, using the command like "iptables -t mangle -A 
       FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --set-mss 
       DESIRED_MSS_VALUE". Here the DESIRED_MSS_VALUE is taken into account

       of common size of IPv4 header without options, common size of TCP 
       header and size of basic IPv6 header and PPPoE header as well.  

    4. Application Tests and Experiments in A+P Environment 

           

       A set of well-known applications have been tested in this IPv6 flavor 
       of A+P environment to access A+P impacts on them. The test results 
       show that IPv6 flavor of A+P has the same impacts on applications as 
       IPv4 flavor A+P does [draft-boucadair-port-range-01]. Web browsing 
       (IE and Firefox), Email (Outlook),Instant message(MSN),Skype, Google 
       Earth work normally with A+P. For more details, please refer to 
       [draft-boucadair-port-range-01].

       For P2P (Peer-to-Peer) applications, when some of them listening on 
       specific port to expect inbounding connection, it is likely to fail 
       due to the listening port is out of A+P port range. Some UPnP 
       extensions may be required to make P2P applications work properly 
       with A+P. Other minor effects of A+P are discussed in section 4.4. 

    4.2. UPnP extension experiment  

           

       To make P2P application work properly with port restricted NAT , we 
       have designed extensions including new variables, new errorcodes as 
       well as new actions to UPnP 1.0, and have them implemented with

       In figure 5, a new error code is proposed for the existing 
       "AddPortMapping" action to explicitly indicate the situation that the 
       requested external port is out of range.

       range. The definitions of these state variables are shown in figure

    4.3. Port Usage of Applications 

           

       Port consumptions of applications not only impact the deployment 
       factor (i.e., port range size) for AplusP solution but also play an 
       important role in determining the port limitation of per customer on 
       AFTR for Dual-Stack Lite. 

       Therefore we have also developed and deployed a Service Probe in our 
       IPv6 network, which use IPv6 TCP socket to ask AplusP CPE for NAT 
       session usage, and store AplusP NAT statistics in a Mysql database 
       for further analysis of application behaviors in terms of port and 
       session consumptions. 

       In figure 8, the maximum port usage of each application is the peak 
       number of port consumption per second during the whole communication 
       process. The duration time represents the total time from the first 
       NAT binding entry being established to the last one being destroyed.

    4.4. BitTorrent Behaviour in A+P 

           

       [draft-boucadair-behave-bittorrent-portrange] provides an exhaustive 
       testing report about the behaviour of BiTtorrent in an A+P 
       architecture. [draft-boucadair-behave-bittorrent-portrange] describes 
       the main behavior of BitTorrent service in an IP shared address 
       environment.  Particularly, the tests have been carried out on a 
       testbed implementing [ID.boucadair-port-range] solution.  The results 
       are, however, valid for all IP shared address based solutions. 

     
     
    Deng, et al.            Expires September 8, 2011              [Page 11] 
        
    Internet-Draft                  Implementing A+P            March 2011 
        

       Two limitations were experienced.  The first limitation occurs when 
       two clients sharing the same IP address want to simultaneously 
       retrieve the SAME file located in a SINGLE remote peer.  This 
       limitation is due to the default BitTorrent configuration on the 
       remote peer which does not permit sending the same file to multiple 
       ports of the same IP address.  This limitation is mitigated by the 
       fact that clients sharing the same IP address can exchange portions 
       with each other, provided the clients can find each other through a 
       common tracker, DHT, or Peer Exchange.  Even if they can not, we 
       observed that the remote peer would begin serving portions of the 
       file automatically as soon as the other client (sharing the same IP 
       address) finished downloading.  This limitation is eliminated if the 
       remote peer is configured with bt.allow_same_ip == TRUE.  

       The second limitation occurs when a client tries to download a file 
       located on several seeders, when those seeders share the same IP 
       address.  This is because the clients are enforcing bt.allow_same_ip 
       parameter to FALSE.  The client will only be able to connect to one 
       sender, among those having the same IP address, to download the file 
       (note that the client can retrieve the file from other seeders having 
       distinct IP addresses).  This limitation is eliminated if the local 
       client is configured with bt.allow_same_ip == TRUE, which is somewhat 
       likely as those clients will directly experience better throughput by 
       changing their own configuration. 

       Mutual file sharing between hosts having the same IP address has been 
       checked.  Indeed, machines having the same IP address can share  
       files with no alteration compared to current IP architectures. 

    5. Security Considerations 

       TBD 

    6. IANA Considerations 

       This document includes no request to IANA. 

    7. Conclusion 

       Despite A+P introduces some impacts on existence applications, issues 
       of P2P applications due to the port restricted NAT have been resolved 
       by UPnP extension experiment in our test bed, and other issues are 
       shared by other IP address sharing solutions. Therefore, from our 
       work, it has been proved that deploying A+P in the Service Provider's 
       IPv6 network during IPv6 transition period is feasible.

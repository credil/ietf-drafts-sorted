             Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Translation
              draft-venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework-03.txt

Abstract

   This draft describes how IPv4/IPv6 multicast translation may be used
   in various scenarios and attempts to be a framework for possible
   solutions.  This can be seen as a companion document to the document
   "Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation" by Baker et al.  When
   considering scenarios and solutions for unicast translation, one
   should also see how they may be extended to provide multicast
   translation.

Internet-Draft  IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Translation Framework      June 2011


1.  Introduction

   There will be a long period of time where IPv4 and IPv6 systems and
   networks need to coexist.  There are various solutions for how this
   can be done for unicast, some of which are based on translation.  The
   document [RFC6144] discusses the needs and provides a framework for
   unicast translation for various scenarios.  Here we discuss the need
   for multicast translation for those scenarios.

   For unicast the problem is basically how two hosts can communicate
   when they are not able to use the same IP protocol.  For multicast we
   can restrict ourselves to looking at how a single source can
   efficiently send to multiple receivers.  When using a single IP
   protocol one builds a multicast distribution tree from the source to
   the receivers, and independent of the number of receivers, one sends
   each data packet only once on each link.  We wish to maintain the
   same characteristics when there are different IP protocols used.
   That is, when the nodes of the tree (source, receivers and routers)
   cannot all use the same IP protocol.  In general there may be
   multiple sources sending to a multicast group, but that can be
   thought of as separate trees, one per source.  We will focus on the
   case where the source and the receivers cannot all use the same IP
   protocol.  If the issue is the network in between, encapsulation may
   be a better alternative.  Note that if the source supports both IPv4
   and IPv6, then one alternative could be for the source to send two
   streams.  This need not be the same host.  There could be two
   different hosts, and in different locations/networks, sending the
   same content.

2.  Translation scenarios

   We will consider six different translation scenarios.  For each of
   the scenarios we will look at how host in one network can receive
   multicast from a source in another network.  For unicast one might
   consider the following six scenarios as described in [RFC6144]:

   Scenario 1: An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet

   Scenario 2: The IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network

   Scenario 3: The IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network

   Scenario 4: An IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet

   Scneario 5: An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network

   Scenario 6: An IPv4 network to an IPv6 network

   We have intentionally left out how one might connect the entire IPv4
   Internet with the entire IPv6 Internet.  In these scenarios one would
   look at how a host in one network initiates a uni- or bi-directional
   flow to another network.  The initiator needs to somehow know which
   address to send the initial packet to, and the initial packet gets
   translated before reaching its destination.

   For unicast translation it is quite natural to talk about networks
   and the Internet.  For multicast this is not so clear, since there is
   limited use of multicast on the Internet.  Certain parts of the
   Internet, e.g. academic and research networks and the links
   connecting them do carry multicast though.  Also, the challenges and
   ideas described here regarding the Internet, also applies in other
   cases where there are multiple connected networks exchanging
   multicast.

   For multicast one generally need a receiver to signal the group (and
   sometimes also the source) it wants to receive from.  The signalling
   generally goes hop-by-hop towards the source to build multicast
   forwarding state that later is used to forward multicast in the
   reverse direction.  This means that for the receiving host to receive
   multicast, it must first somehow know which group (and possibly
   source) it should signal that it wants to receive.  These signals
   would then probably go hop-by-hop to a translator, and then the
   translated signalling would go hop-by-hop from the translator to the
   source.  Note that this description is correct for SSM (source-
   specific multicast), but is in reality more complex for ASM (any-
   source multicast).  An anology to unicast might perhaps be TCP
   streaming where a SYN is sent from the host that wants to receive the



Venaas, et al.          Expires December 23, 2011               [Page 4]

   stream to the source of the stream.  Then the application data flows
   in the reverse direction of the initial signal.  Hence we argue that
   the above unicast scenarios correspond to the following multicast
   scenarios, respectively:

   Scenario 1: An IPv6 network receiving multicast from the IPv4
   Internet

   Scenario 2: The IPv4 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv6
   network

   Scneario 3: The IPv6 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv4
   network

   Scenario 4: An IPv4 network receiving multicast from the IPv6
   Internet

   Scenario 5: An IPv6 network receiving multicast from an IPv4 network

   Scenario 6: An IPv4 network receiving multicast from an IPv6 network

2.1.  Scenario 1: An IPv6 network receiving multicast from the IPv4
      Internet

   Here we have a network, say ISP or enterprise, that for some reason
   is IPv6-only, but the hosts in the IPv6-only network should be able
   to receive multicast from sources in the IPv4 internet.  The unicast
   equivalent is "IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet".

   This is simple because the global IPv4 address space can be embedded
   into IPv6 [RFC6052].  Unicast addresses according to the unicast
   translation in use.  For multicast one may embed all IPv4 multicast
   addresses inside a single IPv6 multicast prefix.  Or one may have
   multiple embeddings to allow for appropriate mapping of scopes and
   ASM versus SSM.  Using this embedding, the IPv6 host (or an
   application running on the host) can send IPv6 MLD reports for IPv6
   groups (and if SSM, also sources) that specify which IPv4 source and
   groups that it wants to receive.  The usual IPv6 state (including MLD
   and possibly PIM) needs to be created.  If PIM is involved we need to
   use RPF to set up the tree and accept data, so the source addresses
   must be routed towards some translation device.  This is likely to be
   the same device that would do the unicast translation.  The
   translation device can in this case be completely stateless.  There
   is some multicast state, but that is similar to the state in a
   multicast router when translation is not performed.  Basically if the
   translator receives MLD or PIM messages asking for a specific group
   (or source and group), it uses these mappings to find out which IPv4
   group (or source and group) it needs to send IGMP or PIM messages



Venaas, et al.          Expires December 23, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Translation Framework      June 2011


   for.  This is no different than multicast in general, except for the
   translation.  Whenever the translator receives data from the IPv4
   source, it checks if it has anyone interested in the respective IPv6
   group (or source and group), and if so, translates and forwards the
   data packets.

   IPv6 applications need to somehow learn which IPv6 group (or source
   and group) to join.  This is further discussed in Section 3.4.

2.2.  Scenario 2: The IPv4 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv6
      network

   Here we will consider an IPv6 network connected to the IPv4 internet,
   and how any IPv4 host may receive multicast from a source in the IPv6
   network.  The unicast equivalent is "the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6
   network".

   This is difficult since the IPv6 multicast address space cannot be
   embedded into IPv4.  Indeed this case has many similarities with how
   IPv4 networks can receive from the IPv6 Internet.  See scenario (4),
   Section 2.4.  However, in this case, all IPv4 hosts on the Internet
   should use the same mapping, and it might make sense to have
   additional requirements on the IPv6 network, rather than to add
   requirements for the IPv4 Internet.

   One solution here might be for the IPv6 source application to somehow
   register with the translator to set up a mapping and receive an IPv4
   address.  The application could then possibly send SDP that includes
   both its IPv6 source and group, and the IPv4 source and group it got
   from the translator.  Of course the signalling could also be done by
   manually adding a static mapping to the translator and specifying
   that address to the application.  If instead we were to do signalling
   on the IPv4 side, then an IPv4 receiver would probably need a
   mechanism for finding an IPv4 address of the translator for a given
   IPv6 group.  The IPv4 address could perhaps be embedded in the IPv6
   group address?  Or with say SDP there could be a way of specifying
   the IPv4 translator address.  The IPv4 host could then communicate
   with the translator to establish a mapping (unless one exists) and
   learn which IPv4 group to join.

   The best alternative might be to restrict the IPv6 multicast groups
   that should be accessible on the IPv4 internet to a certain IPv6
   prefix.  This may allow stateless translation.  This could also be
   used in the reverse direction, for an IPv6 host to receive from an
   IPv4 source.  Or in other words, the same mapping can be used in both
   directions.  This has similarities with IVI [I-D.xli-behave-ivi],
   [RFC6145], [RFC6052] and also [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46].  By using
   IVI source addresses (IPv4-translatable addresses) and a similar



Venaas, et al.          Expires December 23, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Translation Framework      June 2011


   technique for multicast addresses, the correct IPv4 source and group
   addresses can be derived from those.  This method has many benefits,
   the main issue is that it cannot work for arbitrary IPv6 multicast
   addresses.

2.3.  Scenario 3: The IPv6 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv4
      network

   We here consider the case where the Internet is IPv6, but there is
   some network of perhaps legacy IPv4 hosts that is IPv4-only.  We want
   any IPv6 host on the Internet to be able to receive multicast from an
   IPv4 source.  The unicast equivalent is "the IPv6 Internet to an IPv4
   network".

   This scenario can be solved using the same techniques as in Scenario
   1, Section 2.1.  There may however be differences regarding exactly
   which mappings are used and how applications may become aware of
   them.  To obtain full benefit of multicast, all IPv6 hosts need to
   use the same mappings.

2.4.  Scenario 4: An IPv4 network receiving multicast from the IPv6
      Internet

   Here we consider how an IPv4-only host in an IPv4 network may receive
   from an IPv6 multicast sender on the Internet.  The unicast
   equivalent is "an IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet".

   For dual-stack hosts in an IPv4 network one should consider
   tunneling.  This is difficult since we cannot embed the entire IPv6
   space into IPv4.  One might consider some of the techniques from
   scenario (2), Section 2.2.  That scenario is however much easier
   since one may restrict which IPv6 groups are used and there is a
   limited number of sources.

   For unicast one might use a DNS-ALG for this, where the ALG would
   instantiate translator mappings as needed.  This is the technique
   used in NAT-PT [RFC2766], which was deprecated by [RFC4966].

   However, for multicast one generally does not use DNS.  One could
   consider doing the same with an ALG for some other protocol.  E.g.
   translate addresses in SDP files when they pass the translator, or in
   any other protocol that might transfer multicast addresses.  This
   would be very complicated and not recommended.

   Rather than using an ALG that translates addresses in application
   protocol payload, one could consider new signalling mechanisms for
   more explicit signalling.  The additional signalling could be either
   on the IPv6 or the IPv4 side.  It may however not be a good idea to



Venaas, et al.          Expires December 23, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Translation Framework      June 2011


   require additional behavior by host and applications on the IPv6
   Internet to accomodate legacy IPv4 networks.  Also, since one may not
   be able to provide unique IPv4 multicast addresses for all the IPv6
   multicast groups that are in use, it makes more sense that the
   mappings are done locally in each of the IPv4 networks, where IPv4
   multicast addresses might be assigned on-demand.  An IPv4 receiver
   might somehow request an IPv4 mapping for an IPv6 group (and possibly
   source).  This creates a mapping in the translator so that when the
   IPv4 receiver joins the IPv4 group, the translator knows which IPv6
   group (and possibly source) to translate it into.  Of course the
   signalling could also be done manually by adding a static mapping to
   the translator and somehow specifying the right IPv4 address to the
   application.

2.5.  Scenario 5: An IPv6 network receiving multicast from an IPv4
      network

   In this scenario we consider IPv4 and IPv6 networks belonging to the
   same organization.  The unicast equivalent is "an IPv6 network to an
   IPv4 network".

   We would like any IPv6 host to receive from any IPv4 sources.  Here
   one can use the same techniques as for an IPv6 network receiving from
   the IPv4 internet.  It is really a special case of scenario (1),
   Section 2.1.

   The fact that the number of hosts are limited and that there is
   common management might simplify things.  Due to the limited scale,
   one could perhaps just manually configure all the static mappings
   needed in the translator and manually create the necessary
   announcements or in some cases have the applications create the
   necessary announcements.  But it might be better to use a stateless
   approach where IPv4 unicast and multicast addresses are embedded into
   IPv6.  Like IVI [I-D.xli-behave-ivi], or [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46].

2.6.  Scenario 6: An IPv4 network receiving multicast from an IPv6
      network

   In this scenario we consider IPv4 and IPv6 networks belonging to the
   same organization.  The unicast equialent is "an IPv4 network to an
   IPv6 network".

   We would like any IPv4 host to receive from any IPv6 source.  This
   can be seen as special cases of either scenario (2), Section 2.2 or
   scenario (4), Section 2.4, where any of those techniques might apply.
   However, as discussed in scenario (5) Section 2.5 where we looked at
   how to do multicast in the reverse direction; the limited number of
   hosts and common managment might allow us to just use static mappings

   or a stateless approach by restricting which IPv6 addresses are used.
   By using these techniques one may be able to create mappings that can
   be used for multicast in both directions, combining this scenario
   with scenario (5).

3.  Framework

   Having considered some possible scenarios for where and how we may
   use multicast translation, we will now consider some general issues
   and the different components of such solutions.

3.1.  Addressing

   When doing stateless translation, one need to somehow encode IPv4
   addresses inside IPv6 addresses so that there is a well defined way
   for the translator to transform an IPv6 address into IPv4.  This can
   be done with techniques like IVI [I-D.xli-behave-ivi] and
   [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46].

   There are two types of addressing schemes related to the IPv4/IPv6
   multicast translation.  The source addressing and the group
   addressing.

3.1.1.  Source addressing

   Source addressing issues is the same as in the unicast IPv4/IPv6
   translation defined in [RFC6052].  The IPv4-mapped address is used
   for representing IPv4 in IPv6 and the IPv4-translatable address is
   used for representing IPv6 in IPv4 when the stateless translator is
   used.  The multicast RPF relies on the source address to build the
   distribution tree.  Therefore, depending on the operation mode of the
   IPv4/IPv6 translator and receiving directions, the IPv4-mapped or the
   IPv4-translatable addresses will be used.

3.1.2.  Group addressing

   Group addressing issue is unique to the IPv4/IPv6 multicast
   translation.  The entire IPv4 group addresses can be uniquely
   represented by the IPv6 group addresses, while the entire IPv6 group
   addresses cannot be uniquely represented by the IPv6 group addresses.
   Therefore, special group address mapping rule between IPv4 group
   addresses and IPv6 group addresses should be defined for the IPv4/
   IPv6 multicast translation.

3.2.  Routing

   The actual translation of multicast packets may not be very
   complicated, in particular if it can be stateless.  For the multicast
   to actually go through the translator we need to have routes for the
   multicast source addresses involved, so that multicast packets both
   on their way to and from the translator satisfy RPF checks.  These
   routes are also needed for protocols like PIM-SM to establish a
   multicast tree, since RPF is used to determine where to send join



Venaas, et al.          Expires December 23, 2011              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft  IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Translation Framework      June 2011


   messages.  To go into more detail we need to look at different
   scenarios like SSM (Source-Specific Multicast) and ASM (Any-Source
   Multicast), and PIM versus IGMP/MLD.

3.2.1.  Translation with PIM and SSM

   When doing SSM, a receiver specifies both source and group addresses.
   If the receiver is to receive translated packets, it must do an IGMP/
   MLD join for the source and group address that the data packets will
   have after translation.  We will later look at how it may learn those
   addresses.  For the source address it joins, the unicast routing (or
   it may be an alternate topology specific to multicast), must point
   towards the translator.  With this in place, PIM should build a tree
   hop-by-hop from the last-hop router to the translator.  The
   translator then maps the source and group addresses in the PIM join
   to the source and group the data packets have before translation.
   The translator then does a PIM join for that source and group.
   Provided the routing is correct, this will then build a tree all the
   way to the source.  Finally when these joins reach the source, any
   data sent by the source will follow this path to the translator, get
   translated, and then continue to the receiver.

3.2.2.  Translation with PIM and ASM

   Let us first consider PIM Sparse Mode.  In this case a receiver just
   joins a group.  If this group is to be received via the translator we
   need to send joins towards the translator, but initially PIM will
   send joins towards the RP (Rendezvous-Point) for the group.  The most
   efficient solution is probably to make sure that the translator is
   configured as an RP for all groups that one may receive through it.
   That is, for the groups it translates to.  E.g. if IPv4 groups are
   embedded into an IPv6 multicast prefix, then the translator could be
   an RP for that specific prefix.  The translator may then translate
   the group and join towards the group address that is used before
   translation.  Note that if the translator also is an RP for the
   addresses used before translation, it should know which sources exist
   and join each of these.  If it is not an RP, it needs to join towards
   the RP.  If the translator did not know the sources, it may join each
   of the sources as soon as it receives from them (that is, switching
   to Shortest Path Trees).  When the translator receives data, it
   translates it and then sends the translated data.  This then follows
   the joins for the translated groups to the receivers.  When the last-
   hop routers start receiving, they will probably (this is usually the
   default behavior) switch to SPTs (Shortest Path Trees).  These trees
   also need to go to the translator and would probably follow the same
   path as the previously built shared tree.  One might argue here that
   switching to the SPT has no benefit if it is the same path anyway.
   Also with shared trees, RPF is not an issue, so the translated source

   addresses don't need to be routed towards the translator.

   At the end of the previous paragraph we pointed out that there is no
   benefit in switching to shortest path trees if they have to go via
   the translator anyway.  A possibility here could be to use
   Bidirectional PIM where there is no source specific state and data
   always go through the RP.  It is possible to use Bidir just for those
   groups that are translated, and then make the translator the RP.

3.2.3.  Translation with IGMP/MLD

   For translation taking place close to the edge, e.g. a home gateway,
   one may consider just using IGMP and MLD, and no PIM.  In that case
   the translator should for any received MLD reports for IPv6 groups
   that correspond to translated IPv4 groups, map those into IGMP
   reports that it sends out on the IPv4 side.  And vice versa for data
   in the other direction.  Note that a translator implementation could
   also choose to do this in just one direction.  For SSM it would also
   need to translate the source addresses.

3.3.  Translation in operation

   Currently, the proposed solutions for IPv6/IPv4 translation are
   classified into stateless translation and stateful translation.

3.3.1.  Stateless Translation

   For stateless translation, the translation information is carried in
   the address itself, permitting both IPv4->IPv6 and IPv6-<IPv4
   sessions establishment.  The stateless translation supports end-to-
   end address transparency and has better scalability compared with the
   stateful translation.  See [RFC6145] and [I-D.xli-behave-ivi].

   Stateless translation can be used for Scenarios 1, 2, 5 and 6, i.e.
   it supports "An IPv6 network receiving multicast from the IPv4
   Internet", "the IPv4 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv6
   network", "An IPv6 network receiving multicast from an IPv4 network"
   and "An IPv4 network receiving multicast from an IPv6 network".

   In the stateless translation, an IPv6 network uses the IPv4-
   translatable addresses, while the IPv4 Internet or an IPv4 network
   can be represented by IPv4-mapped addresses.

3.3.2.  Stateful Translation

   For stateful translation, the translation state is maintained between
   IPv4 address/port pairs and IPv6 address/port pairs, enabling IPv6
   systems to open sessions with IPv4 systems.  See [RFC6145] and
   [RFC6146].

   Stateful translator can be used for Scenarios 1, 3 and 5, i.e. it
   supports "An IPv6 network receiving multicast from the IPv4
   Internet", "The IPv6 Internet receiving multicast from an IPv4
   network" and "An IPv6 network receiving multicast from an IPv4
   network".

   In the stateful translation, an IPv6 network or the IPv6 Internet use
   any IPv6 addresses, while the IPv4 Internet or an IPv4 network can be
   represented by IPv4-mapped addresses.

3.4.  Application layer issues

   The main application layer issue is perhaps how the applications
   learn what groups (or sources and groups) to join.  For unicast,
   applications may often obtain addresses via DNS and a DNS-ALG.  For
   multicast, DNS is usually not used, and there are a wide range of
   different ways applications learn addresses.  It can be through
   configuration or user input, it can be URLs on a web page, it can be
   SDP files (via SAP or from web page or mail etc), or also via
   protocols like RTSP/SIP.  It is no easy task to handle all of these
   possible methods using ALGs.

   SDP is maybe the most common way for applications to learn which
   multicast addresses (and other parameters) to use in order to receive
   a multicast session.  Inside the SDP files it is common to use
   literal IP addresses, but it is also possible to specify domain
   names.  Applications would then query the DNS for the addresses, and
   a DNS-ALG could perform the necessary translation.  There is however
   a problem with this.

Internet-Draft  IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Translation Framework      June 2011


   Here is a typical SDP taken from RFC 2327:

            v=0
            o=mhandley 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 126.16.64.4
            s=SDP Seminar
            i=A Seminar on the session description protocol
            u=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Handley/sdp.03.ps
            e=mjh@isi.edu (Mark Handley)
            c=IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127
            t=2873397496 2873404696
            a=recvonly
            m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0
            m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31
            m=application 32416 udp wb
            a=orient:portrait

   The line of interest here is "c=IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127".  It is legal
   to use a domain name, this line would then become e.g. "c=IN IP4
   mcast.example.com/127".  The problem here is that the application is
   told to use IPv4.  It will expect the name to resolve to an IPv4
   address, and may ignore any IPv6 replies.  One could argue that it
   would be incorrect to use IPv6, since IPv4 is specified.  For DNS to
   solve our problem, we would need a new IP neutral SDP syntax, and
   applications would need to be updated to support it.

   An alternative to rewriting addresses in the network is to make the
   applications aware of the translation and mappings in use.  One
   approach could be for the source to create say SDP that includes both
   the original and the translated addresses.  This may require use of
   techniques like CCAP [I-D.boucadair-mmusic-ccap] for specifying both
   IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses, allowing the receiver to choose
   which one to use.  The other alternative would be for the receiving
   application to be aware of the translation and the mapping in use.
   This means that the receiving application can receive the original
   SDP, but then apply the mapping to those addresses.

   As we just discussed, it may be useful for applications to perform
   the mappings.  The next question is how they may learn those
   mappings.  The easiest would be if there was a standard way used for
   all mappings, e.g. a well-known IPv6 prefix for embedding IPv4
   addresses.  But that does not work in all scenarios.  There could be
   a way for applications to learn which prefix to use, see
   [I-D.wing-behave-learn-prefix].  But note that there may be different
   multicast prefixes depending on whether we are doing SSM or ASM and
   scope.  In addition we need the unicast prefix for the multicast
   source addresses.  Alternatively one could imagine applications
   requesting mappings for specific addresses on demand from the
   translator.  The translator could have static mappings, or install

Internet-Draft  IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Translation Framework      June 2011


   mappings as requested by applications.

   An alternative to making applications aware of the translation and
   rewriting addresses as needed, could be to do translation in the API
   or stack, so that e.g. an application joins an IPv4 group, the API or
   stack rewrites that into IPv6 and sends the necessary MLD reports.
   When IPv6 packets arrive, the API/stack can rewrite those packets
   back to IPv4.  This could allow legacy IPv4 applications to run on a
   dual-stack node (or IPv6-only with translation in the API) to receive
   IPv4 packets through an IPv6-only network.  But in this case it might
   be better to just use tunneling.

3.5.  Further Work

   There are some special cases and scenarios that should be added to
   this document.  One is addressing.  Are there certain types of IPv6
   multicast addresses that could make translation easier?  What happens
   if there are multiple translators?  And also more details on
   translation in the host, e.g. bump-in-the-stack or bump-in-the-API.

   The document layout of the IPv4/IPv6 multicast translation should be
   presented in this document.

                    CoAP Option Extension : Timeout
              draft-li-core-coap-request-timeout-option-00

Abstract

   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
   networks.  This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP,
   to inform a CoAP server of the maximum time that a CoAP client will
   wait a response to its request.  A CoAP server can use this header to
   ensure that a timely response is generated.

Note

   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
   be sent to core@ietf.org.

Internet-Draft             CoAP-Timeout-Option                  May 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification adds a new option Request-Timeout to CoAP.  The
   main purpose is for the client to indicate the maximum time that a
   CoAP client will wait for a response to its request.

1.1.  Justification

   It is useful for the client to indicate that the response is required
   to be returned within a certain amount of time.  For example, the
   client could require a response within 2 seconds.  This applies to
   both a Piggy-backed Response and a Separate Response.  With this
   indication of the response timeout, the client knows how long it
   should wait for the response, and it needs to keep the state of the
   request only for the indicated time.  After this period, the request
   will be given up.  In this way, the transmission resource can be
   saved to avoid the retransmission of requests.  Also it can avoid
   that the server wastes resources by sending a response which already
   exceeds the set timeout of the client.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   keep the spec open on whether the base is milliseconds or 1024s of a
   second -- the clocks are not going to be that precise anyway, and
   this might help some implementations that count in 1024s
   ("mibiseconds") or in whole seconds.]

2.2.  Using the Request-Timeout Option

   This option is used to indicate the maximum time that a client is
   prepared to wait for a response.

   The client adds the Request-Timeout option to any request for which
   it is prepared to wait for a response.  The client sets the option to
   the maximum time that it is prepared to wait.

   The server interprets this option as the time between receipt of the
   complete request and the time that it generates and begins sending
   the response.  The client will observe a longer time interval between
   request and response, as network transit and processing by proxies
   add delays.  If timing is critical, the client SHOULD consider the
   possible delays and choose the value for the option accordingly.

   The server MAY apply a lower value to the timeout based on local
   policy.  A server MAY choose to take longer to produce a response, at
   the risk that the client is no longer able to use the response.

   In case that the CoAP message is transmitted through a proxy, the
   Proxy MAY reduce the value of a Request-Timeout option based on a
   local policy.  A Proxy MAY add a Request-Timeout option if none is
   present.  The value in the Request-Timeout option MUST NOT be
   increased or removed.

   If the client does not receive a response within the indicated
   response time, the client MAY consider the request as failed.

   If the server can't provide response within the required time, a 5.XX
   (Can't provide the data in time) [TBD] MUST be returned.  Note that
   the client cannot rely on getting the response code, because the
   server might have failed in the meantime.

   This option is not used in a response.

   This option is "elective".  It MUST NOT occur more than once.


3.  Example

   This section gives a short example with a message flow that
   illustrates the use of the Request-Timeout option in a GET request.

   The first example (Figure 1) shows that the client wants to get a
   response within 2048 milliseconds.

4.  Security Considerations

   This presents no security considerations beyond those in section 10
   of the base CoAP specification [I-D.ietf-core-coap].


5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following Option Number entry.

                   +--------+------------------+----------------+
                   | Number | Name             | Reference      |

                   |  20    | Request-Timeout  | Section 2      |
                   +--------+------------------+----------------+

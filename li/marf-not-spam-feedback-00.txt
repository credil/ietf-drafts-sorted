Internet-Draft        Email Feedback Type: not-spam             May 2011


1.  Introduction

   In [RFC5965], an Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) is defined for
   reporting email abuse.  Currently two feedback report types are
   defined that are related to the spam problem, and that can be used to
   report abusive or fraudulent email messages:
   o  abuse: indicates unsolicited email or some other kind of email
      abuse.
   o  fraud: indicates some kind of fraud or phishing activity.

   This specification defines a new feedback report type: "not-spam".
   It can be used to report a message that was mistakenly marked as
   spam.

1.1.  Discussion

   The requirement to indicate a not-spam report type is from the Open
   Mobile Alliance (OMA) Spam Report Requirement Document
   [OMA-SpamRep-RD].

   In some cases, the mail client receives an email message that was
   tagged as spam, either by the mail system or accidentally by the
   user, but the end user finds out that actually it is not spam.  The
   mail client accepts the end user's report instruction and retrieves
   information related to the message, and reports this email as not-
   spam to the mail operator.  When the mail operator receives the
   report, it can take appropriate measures with the mail in the message
   store.  For example, it can remove the spam tag or change the
   category, possibly preventing future similar mail from being marked
   as spam.  The report can be used to adjust the training of an
   automated classifier.  After processing the report, the mail operator
   can send a notification to the mail client about the processing
   result.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   terms take their normative values only when presented in UPPER CASE.


2.  Feedback Report Type: Not-Spam

   This document only defines a new feedback report type, "not-spam",
   extending feedback reports as specified in [RFC5965].

   In the first MIME part of the feedback report message, the end user

   or the mail client MAY add information to indicate why the message is
   not spam -- for example, because the originator or its domain is well
   known.


3.  Example

   In the example, Joe, a pharmaceuticals sales representative, has
   received a message about discount pharmaceuticals.  Because that is a
   frequent subject of spam email, the message has been marked as spam
   -- incorrectly, in this case.  Joe has reported it as "not-spam", and
   this is an example of the report.

4.  Security Considerations

   All of the Security Considerations from [RFC5965] are inherited here.

   Not-spam reports could possibly be used in an attack on a filtering
   system, reporting true spam as "not-spam".  Even in absence of
   malice, some not-spam reports will only apply to the user sending the
   report.  Operators need to be careful in trusting such reports,
   beyond their applicability to the specific user in question.


5.  IANA Considerations

   Registration is requested for the newly defined feedback type name:
   "not-spam", according to the instructions in section 7.3 of the base
   specification [RFC5965].

   Please add the following to the "Feedback Report Type Values"
   registry:
   Feedback Type Name:  not-spam
   Description:  Indicates that a message is not spam.  This may be used
       to correct a message that was incorrectly tagged or categorized
       as spam.

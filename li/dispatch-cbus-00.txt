Internet-Draft       Condition Based URIs Selection           March 2010


1.  Introduction

   Various OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) service enablers need to be able
   to retrieve a list of Addresses (URIs), where the users associated
   with the URIs fulfil certain conditions.  User information is
   evaluated against the conditions, and the matches form a URI list.

   The need for the functionality originates from the OMA PoC (Push to
   talk Over Cellular) service.  However, there is ongoing work in OMA
   to define a common mechanism, called CBUS (Condition Based URIs
   Selection) enabler [OMA-RD-CBUS-V1_0-20090710-C], to provide the
   functionality, so that it can be used for various types of services
   (e.g. messaging, gaming, conferencing and advertisement).

   The CBUS enabler provides the following functions:
      - Support for requestor initiated condition-based URIs selection
      requests.
      - Administration of conditions for URI selection.
      - Interaction with other enablers for retrieval of individual
      user's information (e.g. presence information, location
      information).
      - Evaluation of conditions and selection of matching individual
      users based on the evaluation.
      - Notification of evaluation results to requestor.

   The conditions can be based on user information which changes over
   time (e.g. presence information or geographical location), but they
   can also be based on more static user information (e.g. hobbies or
   personal interests).

   The entity which acts as requestor, and provides the conditions to be
   used for the user information evaluation, is called CBUS client.  The
   CBUS client usually resides on the user equipment, or an application
   server, which supports the CBUS enabler.  The entity which receives
   the selection request, performs the condition evaluation and returns
   the evaluation result to the requestor, is called CBUS Server.  The
   CBUS server usually resides on the application server, which supports
   the CBUS enabler.

   The selection of URIs, based on the provided conditions, may be
   performed by making evaluation of the user information to find out
   whether the conditions are fulfilled or not.

   This specification defines CBUS requirements for the SIP interface
   between the CBUS Client and the CBUS Server, based on the
   requirements defined in "Condition Based URIs Selection Requirements"
   [OMA-RD-CBUS-V1_0-20090710-C].

Internet-Draft       Condition Based URIs Selection           March 2010


   This specification also defines an event package, which can be used
   to return the URI list, and a mechanism for the CBUS client to
   provide the requests to the CBUS server.

   The CBUS client actions triggered by the received URI list, and the
   interactions between the CBUS server and other enablers, are outside
   the scope of this specification.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   Candidate URI: An identifiable entity that is an input URI to the
   CBUS Server for URIs selection.

   Condition: One of a set of expressions that must be matched in order
   for a URI to be selected.

   Evaluation information: The set of user information relevant for the
   evaluation of CBUS Conditions (e.g. presence information, location
   information).

   Reference URI: An identifiable entity that is designated as a
   reference for comparing the corresponding evaluation information with
   all candidate URIs during the evaluation.

   Selected URI: An identifiable entity that matches the conditions and
   is an output URI from the CBUS server.


4.  URI selection examples

4.1.  General

   This chapter shows different types of URI selections supported by
   CBUS.

4.2.  URI selection based on simple conditions

   The provided conditions require evaluation of users based on user
   information from a single information source.

Internet-Draft       Condition Based URIs Selection           March 2010


4.3.  URI selection based on combined conditions

   The provided conditions require evaluation of users based on user
   information from multiple information sources.

4.4.  URI selection using candidate URIs

   The requestor provides, in addition to the conditions, a list of
   candidate URIs.  Evaluation will be done only against the users
   represented by the candidate URIs.

4.5.  URI selection using reference URI

   The requestor provides conditions and a reference URI.  The
   evaluation will be done against the reference URI.


5.  Use-case examples

   Alice has a number of friends.  Each friend has an address
   represented by a URI.  Alice is walking in the city, and figures out
   that there is an interesting exhibition at the city art museum.
   Alice wants to know if any of her friends are also in the city, and
   would like to join her to the museum, and uses the CBUS service to
   retrieve a list of URIs representing friends that may want to join
   her.

   Alice triggers a CBUS subscription.  The subscription contains
   candidate URIs, representing her friends, and two conditions: a
   geographical condition that the friend has to be in the city, and a
   hobby condition that the friend has to be interested in art.

   The CBUS server contacts a location enabler, and an enabler which
   contains hobbies and interests of persons, using the received
   geographical condition as input to location enabler and the received
   hobby condition as input to the enabler containing hobbies.  By
   evaluating the information received from the enablers the CBUS server
   detects a match for Bob: Bob is in the city, and he is interested in
   art.  The CBUS server sends a notification to Alice, which contains
   Bob's URI.  Alice then contacts Bob and asks whether he wants to join
   her to the museum.

Internet-Draft       Condition Based URIs Selection           March 2010


7.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   A SUBSCRIBE request for a cbus-uri-list package SHALL contain a body.
   This body can include conditions to be used by the CBUS server for
   evaluation, and URI candidates to indcate which URIs upon which the
   evaluation is to be performed.

   All subscribers and notifiers MUST support the "application/ cbus-
   condition+xml" data format for the conditions.

7.4.  NOTIFY Bodies

   The body of NOTIFY requests for event cbus-uri-list is discussed in
   Section [8.3].

   In this event package, the body of the notification contains a
   document with listed URIs.  The listed URIs have been selected based
   on the conditions and candidate URIs associated with SUBSCRIBE
   request.

   All subscribers and notifiers MUST support the "application/ cbus-
   uri-list+xml" data format for the URI list.

   The associated SUBSCRIBE request SHALL contain an Accept header
   field, with a value of "application/cbus-uri-list+xml".  Otherwise
   the notification server MUST NOT generate notifications containing
   the data format describe in Section [8.3].

8.  XML Encoding

8.1.  General

   This section defines an XML encoded CBUS Condition data format and
   the CBUS URI List data format for use with CBUS compliant systems.
   The CBUS Condition data payload is expected to be produced by a CBUS
   Client, while a CBUS URI List data payload is expected to be produced
   by a CBUS Server.

   The data formats MUST have the XML declaration and it SHOULD contain
   an encoding declaration in the XML declaration.  If the charset
   parameter of the MIME content type declaration is present and it is
   different from the encoding declaration, the charset parameter takes
   precedence.

Internet-Draft       Condition Based URIs Selection           March 2010


   Every application conformant to this specification MUST accept the
   UTF-8 character encoding to ensure the minimal interoperability.

8.2.  CBUS Condition Data Format

8.2.1.  <condition-set> element

   The <condition-set> element contains the set of conditions that apply
   to the list of candidate URIs.  A request for URI selection based on
   simple conditions (see Section 4.2) MUST contain only one <condition-
   set> element.  A request for URI selection based on combined
   conditions (see Section 4.3) MUST contain more than one <condition-
   set> element.

   The <condition-set> element MAY be omitted when the <candidate-list>
   element is included and only contains a <group> element that
   identifies a group for which conditions have been pre-defined.  In
   all other cases the <condition-set> element MUST be included.  How to
   determine whether there are pre-defined conditions for a group is out
   of scope of this specification.

   The <condition-set> element MUST contain a <condition-list> element
   and an 'information-type' attribute.

8.2.2.  The <candidate-list> element

   The <candidate-list> element contains the list of URIs that
   represents the users to which the conditions apply and among which
   the matching URIs are selected.

   The <candidate-list> element MAY be omitted.  When omitted it means
   that the conditions apply to any user and the selection of URIs is
   performed by search.  The procedure to find the users that fulfill
   the conditions is out of scope of this specification.

   The <candidate-list> element contains one or more <entry> elements.

8.2.3.  The <entry> element

   The <entry> element contains a resource list or a reference to a
   list.

   The <entry> element MUST contain either a <uri>, or <uri-ref>
   element.

Internet-Draft       Condition Based URIs Selection           March 2010


8.2.3.1.  The <uri> element

   The <uri> element is used to specify a single user address.

   The <uri> element is an extension to the <entry> element defined for
   a resource list document as specified in [RFC4826].

8.2.3.2.  The <uri-ref> element

   The <uri-ref> element is used to specify the identity of a referenced
   resource list, e.g. a shared URI-list stored in a shared database.
   How to resolve the identity to a list of URIs that represents the
   users in the list is out of scope of this specification.

   The <uri-ref> element re-uses the <entry-ref> element defined for a
   resource list document as specified in [RFC4826].

8.2.4.  The 'information-type' attribute

   The 'information-type' attribute is used to specify the type of
   evaluation information the conditions are to be evaluated against.
   The value of the 'information-type' attribute is of type "string".
   Following values are pre-defined: "presence", "location", and "user-
   profile".

   The "presence" value indicates that the conditions relates to
   presence information.  The "location" value indicates that the
   conditions relates to location information.  The "user-profile" value
   indicates that the conditions relates to user profile information.

   The <condition-set> element is extendable to contain any type of
   evaluation information.

8.2.5.  The <condition-list> element

   The <condition-list> element is used to specify the conditions that
   require evaluation from one and the same information source, i.e. of
   the same type of evaluation information.

   The <condition-list> element MUST contain one or more <condition>
   elements.

   The <condition-list> element MAY contain one or more <ns-bindings>
   elements.

Internet-Draft       Condition Based URIs Selection           March 2010


8.2.6.  The <condition> element

   The <condition> element is used to specify a condition that applies
   to the list of candidate URIs.

   The <condition> element MUST contain one or more <trigger> elements.
   Multiple appearances of this element denote the "OR" operation.  This
   means that updates to a resource that satisfy any of the <trigger>
   elements criteria constitute that the condition is fulfilled.

   The <condition> element MUST contain an 'id' attribute.  The value of
   the 'id' attribute MUST be unique within the <condition-list>
   element.

8.2.7.  The <ns-bindings> element

   The <ns-bindings> element is used to bind namespaces to local
   prefixes used in expressions that select elements or attributes using
   the syntax in Section 5 in [RFC4661].  Those prefixes apply to the
   <changed> element.

   The <ns-bindings> element contains one or more <ns-binding> elements.
   Each <ns-binding> element has a 'prefix' attribute.  The value of the
   'prefix' attribute is a prefix used to qualify the elements pointed
   to by the expression.  The <ns-binding> element also has a 'urn'
   attribute that identifies the namespace that the prefix represents.

8.2.8.  The <trigger> element

   The <trigger> element is used to specify the information element or
   attribute values by which the condition is fulfilled.

   The <trigger> element MUST contain one of the <equals>, <equals-dec>,
   or <changed> elements.

8.2.8.1.  The 'id' attribute

   The 'id' attribute is used to specify a unique identity of the
   condition within a list of conditions.

8.3.  CBUS URI List Data Format

8.3.1.  The <uri> element

   The <uri> element is used to specify a single user address.

   The <uri> element is an extension to the <entry> element defined for
   a resource list document as specified in [RFC4826].

   The <uri> element MAY contain a 'match' attribute.

Internet-Draft       Condition Based URIs Selection           March 2010


8.3.2.  The 'match' attribute

   The 'match' attribute is used to specify whether the <uri> element
   represents a user that matches the conditions or not.  The attribute
   is only included if explicitly requested by the CBUS client.  The
   attribute can be useful for example when the client does not hold an
   updated list of selected URIs between the notifications.  The value
   of the 'match' attribute is of the type "Boolean".  The default
   value, if omitted, is "true".

8.3.3.  Namespace

   The namespace identifier for elements defined by this section is a
   URN [RFC2141], which uses the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by
   [RFC2648] and extended by [RFC3688].  This urn
   is:urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:cbus-uri-list.

   This namespace declaration indicates the namespace on which the
   conditions and candidates are based.

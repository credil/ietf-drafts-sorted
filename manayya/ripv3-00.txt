1. Introduction

 This draft uses 2 types of metrics to select the route. one is 
 traditional hop count (H) and the other metric uses bandwidth (B).
 
 

2. Implementatin approach


 This draft uses the following topology


    R1--(1Gbps)---R2----(1Gbps)----R3---|N
    |                             | 
    |___________(10Mbps)__________|      

 By default RIPv2 selects the routes based upon hop count. In the 
 above diagram R1 learns the network N through both R2 and R3. 
 Metric for the route learnt through R2 is 2 whereas metric for
 the network learnt through R3 is 1. Hence according to RIPv2 the
 next hop for N is R3 through 10Mbps link. Though the faster link 
 is available, Slow link is selected and used to forward the 
 traffic. To overcome this problem, Bandwidth metric (B) parameter 
 is used in RIPv3 packet.

 In RIPv2, metric field uses 4 bytes. But maximum hop count in RIP 
 is 16. Hence 5 bits are sufficient to represent hop count.
 Hence out of 4 bytes, 2 bytes can be used for metric (hop count H) 
 and 2 more bytes can be used for bandwidth metric(B)

3.RIPv3 Message Format

 This format is similar to RIPV2 packet format except Metric field

 The RIPv3 packet format is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  command (1)  |  version (1)  |       must be zero (2)        |
      +---------------+---------------+-------------------------------+
      |                                                               |
      ~                         RIP Entry (20)                        ~
      |                                                               |
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

   There may be between 1 and 25 (inclusive) RIP entries.  A RIP-1 entry
   has the following format:



       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | address family identifier (2) |      must be zero (2)         |
      +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
      |                        IPv4 address (4)                       |
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+
      |                        must be zero (4)                       |
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+
      |                        must be zero (4)                       |
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+
      |           Bandwidth metric (B)|   hop count metric( H)        |
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+

 Bandwidth Metric - Metric calculated based upon bandwidth. The method 
                    of calculating metric is mentioned in section 5
 Hop count metric - This is same as RIPv2 ( RFC 2453)


 bandwidth metric must be based upon IANA values


4. Route selection procedure

 Whenever router receives the update from neigbors, the following steps
  must be taken before inserting the netowrk into routing table.
 
 If the particluar update is received from only one neighbor, then only 
 hop count metric must be considered.

Manayya KB       Expires Aug 31, 2010                        [Page 3]

 If more than one next hops are available for the same network, 
 Check for the hop count metric field(H) of updates. If all the 
 updates have hop count metric value as 16 then mark that route as 
 unreachable, if some of the hop count metric is/are 16, ignore the 
 updates which have hop count metric 16 and compare the value of
 bandwidth metrics (B) of remaining updates, select the lowest bandwidth 
 metric and insert that route into the routing table.

 
 If more than or equal to 2 routes have same bandwidth metric and Hop 
 count metric (less than 16), then insert all those routes into 
 routing table and use ECMP to forward traffic.
 
 If more than or equal to two routes have same bandwidth metric but 
 different hop count metric, then select the route which has less value
 for hop count metric.

 In the above topology, R3 advertises network N to R2 and R1, when R2 
 receives the update, it checks for the bandwidth of interface on 
 which it has received and add the bandwidth metric (4) to that route
 and send it to R1. When R1 receives the updated hop count metric 
 will be 2 and bandwidth metric is (4+4 considering 4 for 1 GIG 
 bandwidth) whereas route received from R3 in R1 has hop count 
 metric as 1 and bandwidth metric is 100. So R1 has 2 updates, one with  
 hop count metric 1 and bandwidth metric 100, second one with hop count 
 metric 2 but bandwidth metric 8. As none of the routes have metric 16, 
 selection will be based upon bandwidth metric i,e bandwidth metric 8 
 is preffered over 100. So next hop is R2. In this way, RIPv3 can 
 overcome the limitation of RIPv2.

5. IANA Considerations

IANA has to assign the following cost in consultation with the IESG.

Bandwidth     Metric

4 Mbit/s      250 
10 Mbit/s     100 
16 Mbit/s      62 
100 Mbit/s     19 
1 Gbit/s        4 
2 Gbit/s        3 
10 Gbit/s       2

6. Security Considerations

The security considerations listed in RIPv2 [2453] are applicable

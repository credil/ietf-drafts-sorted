INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB                  June 17, 2011


1  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects of Tunnels, Identifiers,
   Label Switch Router and Textual conventions for Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) based Transport Profile (TP).

   This MIB module should be used in conjunction with the MPLS traffic
   Engineering MIB [RFC3812] and companion document MPLS Label Switch
   Router MIB [RFC3813] for MPLS based traffic engineering configuration
   and management.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC2119.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC2578, STD 58, RFC2579 and STD58, RFC2580.

4. Motivations

   The existing MPLS TE [RFC3812] and GMPLS MIBs [RFC4802] do not
   support the transport network requirements of NON-IP based management
   and static bidirectional tunnels.

5. Feature List

   The MPLS transport profile MIB module is designed to satisfy the
   following requirements and constraints:

   The MIB module supports point-to-point, co-routed bi-directional 
   associated bi-directional tunnels.

      -  The MPLS tunnels need not be interfaces, but it is possible
         to configure a TP tunnel as an interface.

      -  The mplsTunnelTable [RFC3812] to be also used for MPLS-TP
         tunnels

      -  The mplsTunnelTable is extended to support MPLS-TP specific
         objects.

      -  A node configuration table (mplsNodeConfigTable) is used to
         translate the Global_Node_ID or ICC to the local identifier
         in order to index mplsTunnelTable.

      -  The MIB module supports persistent, as well as non-persistent
         tunnels.


6. Brief description of MIB Objects

   The objects described in this section support the functionality 
   described in documents [RFC5654] and [TPIDS].  The tables support

   both IP compatible and ICC based tunnel configurations.

6.1.  mplsNodeConfigTable

   The mplsNodeConfigTable is used to assign a local identifier for a 
   given ICC or Global_Node_ID combination as defined in [TPIDS].
   An ICC is a string of one to six characters, each character being
   either alphabetic (i.e. A-Z) or numeric (i.e. 0-9) characters. 
   Alphabetic characters in the ICC should be represented 
   with upper case letters. In the IP compatible mode, 
   Global_Node_ID, is used to uniquely identify a node.

   Each ICC or Global_Node_ID contains one unique entry in the 
   table representing a node. Every node is assigned a local identifier 
   within a range of 0 to 16777215. This local identifier is used for 
   indexing into mplsTunnelTable as mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and 
   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId.

   For IP compatible environment, MPLS-TP tunnel is indexed by Tunnel 
   Index, Tunnel Instance, Source Global_ID, Source Node_ID, 
   Destination Global_ID and Destination Node_ID.

   For ICC based environment, MPLS-TP tunnel is indexed by Tunnel 
   Index, Tunnel Instance, Source ICC and Destination ICC.

   As mplsTunnelTable is indexed by mplsTunnelIndex, 
   mplsTunnelInstance, mplsTunnelIngressLSRId, and 
   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId, the MPLS-TP tunnel identifiers cannot be 
   used directly.

   The mplsNodeConfigTable will be used to store an entry for ICC or 
   Global_Node_ID with a local identifier to be used as LSR ID 
   in mplsTunnelTable. As the regular TE tunnels use IP address as LSR 
   ID, the local identifier should be below the first valid IP address, 
   which is 16777216[1.0.0.0].

6.2.  mplsNodeIpMapTable

   The read-only mplsNodeIpMaptable is used to query the local
   identifier assigned and stored in mplsNodeConfigTable for a given 
   Global_Node_ID. In order to query the local identifier, 
   in the IP compatible mode, this table is indexed with Global_Node_ID.
   In the IP compatible mode for a TP tunnel, Global_Node_ID
   is used. 


   A separate query is made to get the local identifier of both
   Ingress and Egress Global_Node_ID identifiers. These local

INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB                  June 17, 2011


   identifiers are used as mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and
   mplsTunnelEgressLSRId, while indexing mplsTunnelTable.


6.3.  mplsNodeIccMapTable

   The read-only mplsNodeIccMapTable is used to query the local
   identifier assigned and stored in the mplsNodeConfigTable
   for a given ICC. 

   A separate query is made to get the local identifier of both
   Ingress and Egress ICC. These local identifiers are used as 
   mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and mplsTunnelEgressLSRId, 
   while indexing mplsTunnelTable.

6.4.mplsTunnelExtTable 

   mplsTunnelExtTable extends the mplsTunnelTable to add MPLS-TP tunnel
   specific additional objects. All the additional attributes specific
   to TP tunnel are contained in this extended table and could be
   accessed with the mplsTunnelTable indices.

7. MIB Module Interdependencies

   This section provides an overview of the relationship between the
   MPLS-TP TE MIB module and other MPLS MIB modules.

   The arrows in the following diagram show a 'depends on'
   relationship. A relationship "MIB module A depends on MIB module B"
   means that MIB module A uses an object, object identifier, or
   textual convention defined in MIB module B, or that MIB module A
   contains a pointer (index or RowPointer) to an object in
   MIB module B.

          |             | 
          +<---- MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB

          |      MPLS-TE-STD-MIB
          |             |

          |             |
          +------MPLS-LSR-EXT-STD-MIB

       Thus:

        -  All the new MPLS extension MIB modules depend on
           MPLS-TC-EXT-STD-MIB.

        -  MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] contains references to objects in
           MPLS-ID-STD-MIB.

        -  MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB contains references to objects in
           MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812].

        -  MPLS-LSR-EXT-STD-MIB contains references to objects in
           MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813].

   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC 3812] is extended by MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB
   mib module for associating the reverse direction tunnel
   information.

   Note that the nature of the 'extends' relationship
   is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the 
   mplsTunnelExtTable has the same index values as the in the
   mplsTunnelTable.

   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC 3813] is extended by MPLS-LSR-EXT-STD-MIB
   mib module for pointing back to the tunnel entry for easy tunnel
   access from XC entry.

   Note that the nature of the 'extends' relationship

INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB                  June 17, 2011


   is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the 
   mplsXCExtTable has the same index values as the in the mplsXCTable.

8. Dependencies between MIB Module Tables

   The tables in MPLS-TE-EXT-STD-MIB are related as shown on the diagram
   below.  The arrows indicate a reference from one table to another.

                   mplsNodeConfigTable         
                            ^              mplsXCExtTable
                            |               |      ^  
                            |     +---------+      |
                            |     |                |
                            |     V                V
                      mplsTunnelTable ---->mplsXCTable
                            ^                     
                            |                     
                            |                      
                      mplsTunnelExtTable    

   An existing mplsTunnelTable uses the new mplsNodeConfigTable table
   to map the Global_Node_ID and/or ICC with the local number in order
   to accommodate in the existing tunnel table's ingress/egress LSR-id.

   New mplsTunnelExtTable table provides the reverse direction LSP
   information for the existing tunnel table in order to achieve
   bidirectional LSPs.

   mplsXCExtTable is extended from mplsLsrXCTable to provide
   backward reference to tunnel entry.

9. Example of MPLS-TP tunnel setup

   In this section, we provide an example of the IP based MPLS-TP
   co-routed bidirectional tunnel setup. This example provides
   the usage of MPLS-TP Tunnel MIB along with the extended new MIB
   modules introduced in this document.

   Do note that a MPLS-TP tunnel could be setup statically as well as 
   signaled via control plane. This example considers configuration 
   on a head-end LSR to setup a static MPLS-TP tunnel. Only relevant
   objects which are applicable for MPLS-TP tunnel are illustrated here.

      In mplsNodeConfigTable:

      {
      -- Non-IP Ingress LSR-Id (Index to the table) 
        mplsNodeConfigLocalId              = 1,

INTERNET DRAFT                MPLS-TP MIB                  June 17, 2011


        mplsNodeConfigGlobalId             = 1234,
        mplsNodeConfigNodeId               = 10,
      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
        mplsNodeConfigRowStatus         = createAndGo (4)

      -- Non-IP Egress LSR-Id (Index to the table)
        mplsNodeConfigLocalId              = 2,
        mplsNodeConfigGlobalId             = 1234,
        mplsNodeConfigNodeId               = 20,
      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
        mplsNodeConfigRowStatus         = createAndGo (4)
      }

      This will create an entry in the mplsNodeConfigTable for a 
      Global_Node_ID. A separate entry is made for both Ingress LSR 
      and Egress LSR.

      The following read-only mplsNodeIpMapTable table is populated 
      automatically upon creating an entry in mplsNodeConfigTable and
      this table is used to retrieve the local identifier for the given
      Global_Node_ID. 

      In mplsNodeIpMapTable:

      {
      -- Global_ID (Index to the table)  
        mplsNodeIpMapGlobalId             = 1234,
      -- Node Identifier (Index to the table)
        mplsNodeIpMapNodeId               = 10,
        mplsNodeIpMapLocalId              = 1

      -- Global_ID (Index to the table)  
        mplsNodeIpMapGlobalId             = 1234,
      -- Node Identifier (Index to the table)
        mplsNodeIpMapNodeId               = 20,
        mplsNodeIpMapLocalId              = 2
      }

      The following denotes the configured tunnel "head" entry:

     In mplsTunnelTable:

      {
        mplsTunnelIndex              = 1,
        mplsTunnelInstance           = 1,
      -- Local map number created in mplsNodeConfigTable for Ingress

      We must next create the appropriate in-segment and out-segment
      entries.  These are done in [RFC3813] using the mplsInSegmentTable
      and mplsOutSegmentTable. 

      For the forward direction.

      In mplsOutSegmentTable:
      {
         mplsOutSegmentIndex          = 0x00000012,
         mplsOutSegmentInterface      = 13, -- outgoing interface

         mplsOutSegmentRowStatus         = createAndGo (4)
      }

     For the reverse direction.

      In mplsInSegmentTable:
      {
         mplsInSegmentIndex           = 0x00000016
         mplsInSegmentLabel           = 21, -- incoming label 
         mplsInSegmentNPop            = 1,

         mplsInSegmentRowStatus          = createAndGo (4)
      }


      Next, two cross-connect entries are created in the mplsXCTable of
      the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813], thereby associating the newly
      created segments together.

      In mplsXCTable:
      {
         mplsXCIndex                = 0x01,
         mplsXCInSegmentIndex       = 0x00000000,

      In mplsXCTable:
      {
         mplsXCIndex                = 0x01,
         mplsXCInSegmentIndex       = 0x00000016,

         mplsXCRowStatus            = createAndGo(4)
      }

      This table entry is extended by entry in the
      mplsXCExtTable.  Note that the nature of the 'extends'
      relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the 
      mplsXCExtTable has the same index values as the entry in
      the mplsXCTable.

      First for the forward direction:

      In mplsXCExtTable
      {
        -- Back pointer from XC table to Tunnel table
        mplsXCExtTunnelPointer         = mplsTunnelName.1.1.1.2
      }

      Next for the reverse direction:

      In mplsXCExtTable
      {
        -- Back pointer from XC table to Tunnel table
        mplsXCExtTunnelPointer         = mplsTunnelName.1.2.1.2

14. Security Consideration

      There is a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      that has a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.. Such objects may be
      considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network
      operations.

      Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects
      with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
      these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
      objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are
      the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
      Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
      even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
      allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
      the objects in this MIB module.

      It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security
      features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],
      section 8), including full supports for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).

      Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
      enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
      responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
      instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give
      access to the objects only to those principles (users) that
      have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
      them.

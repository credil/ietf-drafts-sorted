Abstract

   This document proposes a modification to the 6rd deployment model for
   IPv6.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6
   networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd
   requires support by a device (the 6rd CE) on the customer site, which
   must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model
   described in this document uses tunnels from operator-owned "6rd
   Gateways" collocated with the operator's IPv4 network edge.  The
   tunnels may be provisioned or automatic.  The advantages of this
   approach are that it requires no modification to customer equipment
   and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  It
   also allows the 6rd prefix portion of the prefixes delegated to
   customer devices to be longer than can generally be achieved by basic
   6rd.  The gateway initiated 6rd model reuses the protocol defined in
   RFC 5969.

1.  Introduction

   6rd [RFC5969] provides a transition tool for connecting IPv6 devices
   across an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network, at which point the packets
   can be routed natively.  The network topology is shown in Figure 1.

                     Figure 1: 6rd Deployment Topology

   In Figure 1, the CE is the customer edge router.  It is provisioned
   with a delegated IPv6 prefix, but also with an IPv4 address so that
   it is reachable through the IPv4 network.  As a consequence, the
   routers in the IPv4 network have to carry a route for every customer
   site.  In a large network, this can lead to very large routing
   tables.  Further, the need to provision an IPv4 address for every 6rd
   user will aggravate the pressure due to IPv4 address shortage for
   operators faced with a high rate of growth in the number of broadband
   subscribers to their network.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   6rd prefix  As in [RFC5969], an IPv6 prefix selected by the service
           provider for use by a 6rd domain.

   customer device  Either a single customer-owned router serving as the
           interface between the customer network and the provider
           network, or, in the absence of such a device, an individual
           host in the customer network.

   6rd Gateway  A device functioning as a gateway initiated 6rd tunnel
           endpoint, collocated with the provider IPv4 network edge.  A
           typical 6rd Gateway has virtual or point-to-point links to
           many customer devices, an interface to the provider IPv4
           network, and a virtual 6rd interface.

   gateway initiated 6rd delegated prefix  The prefix calculated by the
           network for delegation to a customer device, obtained by
           combining the 6rd prefix, a 6rd Gateway Identifier used for
           routing from the 6rd Border Relay to the serving 6rd Gateway,
           and a Gateway-scoped customer device identifier.  Like the
           6rd delegated prefix in [RFC5969], this prefix can be
           considered logically equivalent to a DHCPv6 IPv6 delegated
           prefix [RFC3633].

   6rd domain  As in [RFC5969], with the substitution of the 6rd Gateway
           for the 6rd CE as a component of the domain.

   6rd Border Relay (BR)  As in [RFC5969].

   6rd virtual interface  As in [RFC5969], with the substitution of the
           6rd Gateway for the 6rd CE.

   6rd Gateway IPv4 address  The IPv4 address configured on the 6rd
           Gateway as part of the provider network.  This address may be
           global or private [RFC1918] within the 6rd domain.  If IPv6-
           in-IPv4 tunnels are used, this address is used in compressed
           form as the Gateway Identifier portion of the gateway
           initiated 6rd delegated prefix.


2.  Problem Statement

   Consider a fixed broadband operator facing a high subscriber growth
   rate.  As a result of this growth rate, the operator faces pressure
   on its stock of available public IPv4 addresses.  For this reason,
   the operator is motivated to offer IPv6 access as quickly as
   possible.

   The backbone network will be the first part of the operator's network
   to support IPv6.  The metro network is not so easily upgraded to
   support IPv6 since many devices need to be modified and there may be
   some impact to existing services.  Thus any means of providing IPv6
   access has to minimize the changes required to devices in the metro
   network.

   In contrast to the situation described for basic 6rd [RFC5569], the
   operator is assumed to be unable to manage IP devices on the customer
   premises.  As a result, the operator cannot assume that any of these
   devices are capable of supporting 6rd.

   If the customer equipment is dual-stack, it will be natural for that
   equipment to request IPv4 addresses, and pretty well impossible for
   the operator to avoid assigning them.  However, the operator has an

   opportunity to avoid assigning IPv4 addresses to customer devices
   running IPv6 only, if some other means is available for routing IPv6
   traffic through the IPv4 network to and from that site.


3.  Proposed Solution

   For basic 6rd, the 6rd-CE described in [RFC5969] initiates a 6-in-4
   tunnel to the Border Relay to carry its IPv6 traffic.  To avoid the
   requirement for customer premises equipment to fulfill this role, it
   is necessary to move the tunneling function to a network device.
   This document identifies a functional element termed the 6rd Gateway
   to perform this task.  The functions of the 6rd Gateway are:

   o  to generate and allocate gateway initiated 6rd delegated prefixes
      for IPv6-capable customer devices;

   o  to forward outgoing IPv6 packets through a tunnel to a Border
      Relay, which extracts and forwards them to an IPv6 network as for
      6rd;

   o  to extract incoming IPv6 packets tunneled from the 6rd Border
      Relay and forward them to the correct user device.

   In the proposed solution, there is only one tunnel between each 6rd
   Gateway and the Border Relay, which greatly reduces the number of
   tunnels the Border Relay has to handle.  The deployment scenario
   consistent with the problem statement in Section 2 collocates the
   Gateway with the IP edge of the access network.  This is shown in
   Figure 2, and is the typical placement of the Broadband Network
   Gateway (BNG) in a fixed broadband network.  By assumption, the metro
   network beyond the BNG is IPv4.  Transport between the customer site
   and the 6rd Gateway uses layer 2.

   o  IPv6 packets are tunneled between the 6rd Gateway and the 6rd
      Border Relay.  The tunnel may be provisioned or may be an
      automatic IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel as in basic 6rd, depending on the
      operator's requirements.  Provisioned tunnels may cost less in
      smaller-scale deployments, while automatic tunneling becomes
      preferable as the number of customer devices and hence 6rd
      Gateways in a 6rd domain becomes large.

   o  The IPv6 prefix delegated to the customer device contains a
      Gateway identifier which the 6rd Border Relay can map to a tunnel
      connecting to the serving 6rd Gateway.  In the case of IPv6-in-
      IPv4 tunnels, this identifier is the compressed 6rd Gateway IPv4
      address, and the Border Relay uses the expanded address as the
      IPv4 destination address for the encapsulated packets.

   o  The IPv6 prefix delegated to the customer device also contains an
      index that is unique to that customer device.  As a result, the
      6rd Gateway can map the IPv6 destination address uniquely to the
      Layer 2 address of the customer device, either on the basis of the
      complete routing prefix or by extracting the the customer device
      index portion of that prefix.

   Incidentally to this, the 6rd Gateway serves as an IPv4 aggregation
   point for all of the customer sites it serves.

3.1.  6rd Prefix Delegation

   Referring back to Figure 2, prefix delegation to the customer
   equipment occurs in the normal fashion through the Gateway/IP edge,
   using SLAAC or DHCPv6.  Each delegated prefix MUST contain a 6rd
   prefix valid for the 6rd domain, the Gateway Identifier for the 6rd
   Gateway, and an index that identifies the specific customer device.
   Figure 3 shows the structure of a complete IPv6 address based on the
   gateway initiated 6rd delegated prefix, in a form analogous to Figure
   1 of [RFC5969].

   prefix.  The 6rd prefix portion is a preconfigured value (see
   Section 3.4).  The 6rd Gateway MUST append to this its configured
   Gateway Identifier.  In the case of IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling, this
   identifier will be the low-order bits of its IPv4 address on the
   virtual link between itself and the Border Relay, where the number of
   bits is based on the length of the IPv4 address mask for 6rd Gateway
   addresses within the 6rd domain.  Finally, the 6rd Gateway MUST
   append an index value which is unique for each customer device to
   which the 6rd Gateway delegates a prefix.  The length of the index
   value is configured on the 6rd Gateway (see Section 3.4).  The index
   value MAY be assigned permanently or MAY be assigned only for the
   period during which the customer device is connected to the network.

   With the present proposal, there is no concern about IPv4 address
   lifetimes, as there is with basic 6rd.  The Gateway/IP edge will be
   assigned a permanent value for its Gateway identifier (e.g., IPv4
   address), using the operator's normal network provisioning processes.
   However, since the customer device is never assigned an IPv4 address,
   AAA has to be modified to use the delegated IPv6 prefix to track the
   customer.

3.2.  Troubleshooting and Traceability

   The operator can apply the normal tools for troubleshooting for the
   portion of the path between the 6rd Gateway and the 6rd Border Relay,
   depending on the tunneling technology that has been deployed.  Since
   no IPv4 address is assigned to individual customer devices, however,
   IPv4-based tools cannot be used to identify debug problems extending
   beyond the 6rd Gateway to the customer device.  If the customer
   device supports IPv6 anycast, it is possible to test end-to-end
   connectivity from the 6rd BR using IPv6 Echo requests and responses.
   If the device does not support IPv6 anycast, end-to-end testing
   requires knowledge of a specific IPv6 address that the customer
   device has assigned to its interface with the network.

   For the purpose of such testing, the 6rd Border Relay needs an IPv6
   address that it can identify as its own either in an ICMPv6 echo
   request that it receives or in an echo response from the customer
   device.  The 6rd Gateway must be able to select the tunnel to the
   correct 6rd BR based on this address.  For IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling,
   these requirements can be met in the same way as in [RFC5969] if the
   6rd Gateways and Border Relays in a 6rd domain share the same IPv4
   address space and a common mask.  For other tunneling technologies,
   IPv6 prefixes for the BRs can be generated using the same principles
   as for the prefixes assigned to customer devices provided that the
   BRs are assigned identifiers within the Gateway Identifier numbering
   space.  The 6rd Gateways need to be able to map from Gateway
   Identifiers to the corresponding BR tunnels.

3.3.  Address Selection

   No change from [RFC5969].

3.4.  Gateway Initiated 6rd Configuration

3.4.1.  Configuration For IPv6-in-IPv4 Tunneling

   For IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling, Section 7 of [RFC5969] applies, except
   that the 6rd Gateway rather than the 6rd CE is configured with the
   IPv4MaskLen, 6rdPrefix, 6rdPrefixLen, and 6rdBRIPv4Address.  In
   addition to these values, each 6rd Gateway MUST be configured with
   CustDevIndexLen, the number of bits used to represent the customer
   device index portion of the gateway initiated 6rd delegated prefix.

   The IPv4MaskLen is redefined to be the number of high-order bits that
   are identical across all IPv4 addresses assigned to 6rd Gateways in
   the 6rd domain.

   No special configuration of customer equipment, in particular,
   customer edge routers, is required.  Hence the 6rd DHCPv4 option is
   inapplicable.

   Border Relay configuration is unchanged from [RFC5969].

   The discussion of Neighbour Unreachability Detection in [RFC5969] is
   inapplicable.

   The considerations on IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in Section 9 of
   [RFC5969] apply with the substitution of the 6rd Gateway for the 6rd
   CE.

3.4.2.  Configuration For Other Tunneling Technologies

   For other tunneling technologies, the following differences apply
   relative to the previous section.

   o  IPv4MaskLen is generalized to GWIDLen, defined as the number of
      bits in the Gateway Identifier portion of the delegated prefix.

   o  Each 6rd Gateway is configured with its own Gateway Identifier
      value.

   o  For troubleshooting purposes (see Section 3.2), each 6rd Border
      Relay is configured either with a complete IPv6 prefix the use of
      which is restricted to the 6rd domain, or with a Gateway
      Identifier value that it can use to construct such a prefix.
      Correspondingly, the 6rd Gateways are configured with mappings

      between the BR prefixes (or their Gateway Identifier portion) and
      the tunnels connecting to them.

3.5.  Transition Considerations

   No change from [RFC5969].  This technique can co-exist with dual-
   stack operation at the customer site, assuming that the 6rd Gateway
   is configured as the default outgoing gateway for IPv6 traffic.

3.6.  IPv6 Address Space Usage

   The discussion of Section 11 of [RFC5969] is modified with the
   following example.  In essence, the restriction of IPv4 addressing to
   the 6rd Gateways rather than individual customer devices allows for a
   greater degree of address compression, even if some of that is taken
   back by the need to allocate bits for a customer device index.

   To give a numerical example, consider a 6rd domain containing ten
   million IPv6-capable customer devices (a rather high number given
   that 6rd is meant for the early stages of IPv6 deployment).  The
   estimated number of 6rd Gateways needed to serve this domain would be
   in the order of 3,300, each serving 30,000 customer devices.
   Assuming best-case compression for the Gateway addresses, the Gateway
   Identifier field has length o = 12 bits.  If IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling
   is being used, this best case is more likely to be achievable than it
   would be if the IPv4 addresses belonged to the customer devices.
   More controllably, the customer device index has length n = 15 bits.
   Overall, these figures suggest that the length p of the 6rd prefix
   can be 29 bits for a /56 delegated prefix, or 21 bits if /48
   delegated prefixes need to be allocated.

Abstract

   Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transition
   scenarios, where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports one
   IP version, but the host and Network B support a different IP
   version.  Suppose that the host wishes to access a multicast group
   which is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document specifies a
   stateful translation mechanism whereby the host can obtain its
   desired access using the native multicast capabilities of Network A.

1.  Introduction

   Transition scenarios have been explored in which an IPv6 host
   attached to an IPv4 network wishes to access content in an IPv6
   network, or conversely, an IPv4 host attached to an IPv6 network
   wishes to access content in an IPv4 network.  A long list of tools
   has been put forward for passing unicast content across the network
   in the middle, based either on tunneling or on translation.

   Some work has also been done on conveying multicast streams between
   IPv4 and IPv6 networks, in either direction.  Of particular interest
   is current work in [ID.venaas-mcast46], which was the original
   inspiration for the content of the present document.  However, the
   present document differs from [ID.venaas-mcast46] both in point of
   view and in the detailed mechanism used for translation.
   [ID.boucadair-64-multicast] presents a different approach, relying
   like [ID.venaas-mcast46] on specially constructed multicast
   addresses.  The present document presents no such restriction.
   Instead it makes use of the fact that for a given network, it is
   unnecessary to map the complete universe of IPv6 addresses into IPv4,
   but only those addresses actually being carried through the network.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Problem Description

   We consider, as described in the previous section, a host supporting
   one IP version, say IPvx, attached to a provider network supporting a
   different version, say IPvy.  Obviously there has to be an adaptation
   function between the host and the network to make this work.  We
   distinguish between the unicast and multicast adaptation functions,
   where multicast adaptation by definition processes both signalling
   and the actual media streams.  This document is not concerned with
   the mechanism (tunneling, translation) used for unicast adaptation,
   but specifies the host-side multicast adaptation mechanism as part of
   the proposed solution.

   On the other side of the provider network, border gateways connect to
   neighbouring networks.  If a particular neighbouring network supports
   a different version of IP -- that is, IPvx, then the border gateway
   must also implement adaptation functions.  This document is
   specifically interested in the border multicast adaptation function.

Internet-Draft        Generic Multicast Translation         January 2011


      Note that when tunneling is used to carry IPvx traffic across the
      provider network, the adaptation functions on the host and border
      gateway sides of the provider network are complementary.  As a
      result, the border gateway has to implement a different adaptation
      function for flows to and from IPvx hosts from what it implements
      for flows to and from IPvy (i.e., native) hosts.

   The basic situation just described is illustrated in Figure 1.  The
   host-side adaptation functions MAY be implemented in the host itself,
   in a separate piece of equipment at the customer site (CPE-based
   approach), or at the provider edge (gateway initiated approach).

     Figure 1: Adaptation Functions For Flows Crossing Two IP Version
                                Boundaries

   The key assumption of this document is that when the host wishes to
   acquire a multicast stream rooted or sourced in the IPvx network, it
   knows only the IPvx address pair <Source, Group> (where the source
   MAY be wild-carded, i.e., for an any-source multicast group).

      It learns that address pair by means outside the scope of this
      specification (e.g., via the web or session signalling).

   As a result, the host-side multicast adaptation function (HMAF) needs
   to obtain a mapping between this IPvx address pair and the
   corresponding IPvy address pair used in the IPvy network to denote
   the same multicast stream.  Similarly, the border multicast
   adaptation function (BMAF) needs this mapping so it can do its job.

3.  Proposed Solution

   The proposed solution consists of three elements:

   o  a stateful mapping function (Mapper, in the rest of this document)
      within the IPvy provider network that provides mappings between
      IPvx <Source, Group> address pairs and corresponding IPvy <Source,
      Group> address pairs denoting the same multicast flows;

   o  address pools of IPvy multicast and unicast addresses provisioned
      at the Mapper;

   o  a protocol that allows the HMAF and BMAF to request mappings from
      the Mapper.  PCP [ID.port-control-protocol] is a candidate for
      this protocol, but that decision needs further consideration.

3.1.  How It Works

   1) Initial discovery and Join request

   The IPvx host discovers the <Source, Group> address pair of a
   multicast stream the user wants to receive.  The IPvx Host sends an
   MLDv2 [RFC3810] (for IPv6) or IGMPv3 [RFC3376] (for IPv4) Join
   request to the HMAF to acquire the stream.

   2) <Source, Group> Address Mapping At the HMAF

   The HMAF checks its cache of mappings to see if it already has a
   mapping between the IPvx <Source, Group> address pair received in the
   host request and a corresponding pair of IPvy addresses.  Failing to
   find a mapping, it sends a request for the required mapping to the
   Mapper.  The Mapper in turn checks whether it has already created the
   mapping.  If not, it assigns unicast and multicast IPvy addresses
   from its pool and records the mapping for further use.  In either
   case it returns the requested mapping to the HMAF, which caches it.
   [Editor's Note: The transaction is carried out over a protocol to be
   specified in a later version of this document.]

   3) Propagation Of the Join Request Into the IPvy Network

   Using the mapping it has received, the HMAF interworks from MLDv2 to
   IGMPv3 or vice versa, depending on whether the host supports IPv6 or
   IPv4.  It forwards the interworked Join request to the Provider IP
   Edge.

      If the HMAF is collocated with the Provider IP Edge, this
      interworking step is an internal operation.




Tsou, et al.             Expires August 1, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Generic Multicast Translation         January 2011


   The Provider IP Edge acts on the received request by interworking it
   to a Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) [RFC4601]
   request and forwarding that request into the IPvy network, indicating
   the IPvy <Source, Group> address pair it was given and ensuring that
   it is on the multicast tree for the stream concerned.

   Assuming that the multicast tree for the requested stream is not
   joined at an earlier point in the provider network, eventually the
   PIM request finds its way to the BMAF.  It has been suggested that
   the border gateway in which the BMAF resides can be made a PIM-SM
   rendezvous point (RP) to ensure that requests for new groups reach
   it.

   4) Remapping the <Source, Group> Address Pair At the BMAF

   The BMAF needs to map from the IPvy <Source, Group> address pair it
   received back to the corresponding IPvx address pair before
   propagating the PIM request into the IPvx network.  It sends a
   request to the Mapper to provide that mapping.  The Mapper already
   has this mapping, as a result of the original HMAF request, and
   returns it to the BMAF.  [Editor's note: protocol again to be
   specified later.  It can probably be the same as the one used by the
   HMAF.  Have to work out the security considerations.]

   5) Propagation Of the PIM Request Into the IPvx Network

   The BMAF propagates translates the PIM request from IPvy to IPvx
   using the mapping it received.  It propagates the request into the
   IPvx network to complete the construction of the path for the
   requested multicast stream.  If path construction fails, the BMAF
   SHOULD notify the Mapper so it can mark the IPvx address pair as bad
   (so it doesn't get remapped) while releasing the assigned IPvy
   addresses.

   6) Transport of Multicast Media and Unicast RTCP Feedback

   If the BMAF receives a multicast packet from the IPvx network, it
   translates the source and group addresses to IPvy using the mapping
   it has retained from Step 4.  It then forwards it to the next hop in
   the multicast tree for that stream.

   When the HMAF receives a multicast packet from the IPvy network, it
   translates the packet to IPvx using the mapping which it has retained
   from Step 2.

   When the IPvx host sends unicast RTCP [RFC3550] feedback toward the
   source, the packets are handled like any other unicast packets.  That
   is, they are processed by the unicast adaptation functions rather

Internet-Draft        Generic Multicast Translation         January 2011


   than the HMAF and BMAF.

   Finally, if the IPvx Host emits multicast packets destined for an
   any-source multicast group, the HMAF and BMAF translate the packets
   from IPvx to IPvy and back again using the mappings they have
   retained.


4.  Mapping Request Protocol

   To come.


5.  Numerical Examples

5.1.  4-6-4 Example

   This is an example for the scenario where an IPv4 host is trying to
   acquire a multicast stream from an IPv4 network across an IPv6
   network.

   Assume that the Mapper has been assigned a pool of any-source
   multicast (ASM) group addresses in the range FF38:38:2001:DB8:7F61:
   1000:98FD::/112.  For specific-source multicast (SSM), it has a pool
   of source addresses in the range 2001:DB8:7F61:2000::/56 with
   corresponding group addresses in the range FF38::98FD:/112.  (In real
   life the pool of source addresses would probably be smaller.)

   Suppose now that the host wishes to receive the SSM multicast flow
   <192.0.2.0, 234.192.0.2>.  As documented in [RFC3376], the
   application performs an IPMulticastListen socket operation to that
   effect, which causes an IGMPv3 State-Change Report to be transmitted
   carrying that information.

   The HMAF intercepts the State-Change Report.  Assuming it does not
   already have a mapping for the SSM multicast flow <192.0.2.0,
   234.192.0.2>, it sends a request to the Mapper.  The Mapper checks
   its set of allocated address pairs for SSM multicast flows, and
   either finds that it has already mapped the requested pair or this is
   a new mapping.  In the first case, it returns the mapped IPv6
   addresses it has already allocated.  In the second case, it selects a
   <Source, Group> address pair from its pool and records the mapping.
   Suppose in the present example it returns the pair: <2001:DB8:7F61:
   2000::7F, FF38::98FD:25>.

      For comparison, the stateless mappings provided by the combination
      of [RFC6052] for the source address and
      [ID.boucadair-64-multicast] for the group identifier would provide



Tsou, et al.             Expires August 1, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Generic Multicast Translation         January 2011


      the mapping: <64:FF9B::192.0.2.0, FFB8:10::234.192.0.2>.

   Continuing with our example, the HMAF interworks the IGMPv3 State-
   Change Report to an MLDv2 [RFC3810] Multicast Listener Report
   updating the set of multicast flows to which hosts served by the HMAF
   instance are listening.  The report includes the new Multicast
   Address Record field with the multicast address FF38::98FD:25 and the
   single multicast source 2001:DB8:7F61:2000::7F. The HMAF forwards
   this message to the Provider IP Edge.

   The Provider IP Edge updates its own multicast state tables, then
   issues a PIM-SM [RFC4601] Join request to update the multicast tree
   for the requested multicast flow.  The PIM-SM Join request makes its
   way through the IPv6 network, eventually reaching the BMAF.  As
   mentioned above, this could be because the border gateway containing
   the BMAF was designated as a rendezvous point, or it could be through
   some other method of routing configuration.

   The BMAF recognizes that the PIM request relates to a mapped
   multicast group.  It first checks its own cache to see if it already
   has the reverse mapping.  If it does not, it sends a query to the
   Mapper.  The Mapper responds with the original address pair:
   <192.0.2.0, 234.192.0.2>.  The BMAF uses the returned reverse mapping
   to update the PIM Join, then forwards it to the IPv4 network.

   PIM-SM has subsequent phases in which it optimizes the distribution
   tree and establishes the source filters, but these need not be
   discussed.  When content begins to flow from the IPv4 network, the
   packets have source address 192.0.2.0 and destination address
   234.192.0.2.  The BMAF replaces these with source address 2001:DB8:
   7F61:2000::7F and destination address FF38::98FD:25 from the mapping
   that it has cached, and forwards the packets to the next hop(s) in
   the multicast distribution tree for that flow.

   When the packets arrive at the HMAF, it locates the corresponding
   address mapping in its cache.  It replaces the source address with
   192.0.2.0 and the destination address with 234.192.0.2 and forwards
   the packets to the host.

5.2.  6-4-6 Example

   In this example, an IPv6 host is trying to access multicast content
   from an IPv6 network across an IPv4 network.  Given that the space of
   multicast addresses permitted for examples is limited to three values
   (derived from the three unicast /24s reserved for examples), we do
   not specify the pools allocated to the Mapper, but assume that the
   operator can provision it with an adequate number in practice.

Internet-Draft        Generic Multicast Translation         January 2011


   From this point, the example proceeds as the 4-6-4 example, but (for
   the example) with the numbers reversed.

   1.  The IPv6 host wishes to access an SSM flow with source 2001:DB8:
       7F61:2000::7F and group identifier FF38::98FD:25.  It sends an
       MLDv2 Multicast Listener Report toward the HMAF indicating this.

   2.  The HMAF intercepts the MLDv2 message.  If it does not already
       have the mapping in its cache, it sends a request to the Mapper
       indicating the IPv6 source and group.  The Mapper allocates the
       source address 192.0.2.0 and the SSM group address 234.192.0.2
       from its pool.  It retains the mapping for further use and
       returns the result to the HMAF.

          In the 6-4-6 case, no general stateless mapping method is
          defined.

   3.  The HMAF interworks the MLDv2 Multicast Listener Report to an
       IGMPv3 State-Change Report and forwards it to the Provider IP
       Edge, including the IPv4 address pair returned by the Mapper.

   4.  The Provider IP Edge updates its own state tables, interworks the
       IGMPv3 State-Change Request to a PIM-SM Join and forwards it.

   5.  Eventually the PIM request reaches the BMAF.  The BMAF retrieves
       the reverse mapping from its cache or from the Mapper.  As a
       result, it replaces the source address with
       2001:DB8:7F61:2000::7F and the group identifier with
       FF38::98FD:25.  It converts the PIM message to IPv6 and forwards
       it into the IPv6 network.

   6.  When packets of content arrive from the IPv6 network, they have
       source address 2001:DB8:7F61:2000::7F and destination address
       FF38::98FD:25.  The BMAF retrieves the reverse mapping from its
       cache and changes the packets to IPv4, with source address
       192.0.2.0 and destination address 234.192.0.2.  It forwards them
       to the next hop(s) in the distribution tree.

   7.  When the packets reach the HMAF it retrieves the applicable
       mapping from its cache and converts the packets backet to IPv6
       with source address 2001:DB8:7F61:2000::7F and destination
       address FF38::98FD:25.  It forwards the packets toward the host.


6.  Operational Considerations

   The proposal presented here incurs the operational expense of

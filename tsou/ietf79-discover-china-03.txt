Internet-Draft      Discover a Real China in IETF 79       November 2010


1.  Some Companies In China's High-Tech Industry

1.1.  Baidu - Chinese Search Provider

   This is a quotation from the Baidu website:

      Many people have asked about the meaning of our name.  "Baidu" was
      inspired by a poem written more than 800 years ago during the Song
      Dynasty.  The poem compares the search for a retreating beauty
      amid chaotic glamour with the search for one's dream while
      confronted by life's many obstacles. "...  Hundreds and thousands
      of times, for her I searched in chaos, suddenly, I turned by
      chance, to where the lights were waning, and there she stood."
      Baidu, whose literal meaning is hundreds of times, represents
      persistent search for the ideal.

      Baidu chose a poetic Chinese name because it wants the world to
      remember its heritage.  As a native speaker of the Chinese
      language and a talented engineer, Baidu focuses on what it knows
      best - Chinese language search.  Applying avant-garde technology
      to the world's most ancient and complex language is as challenging
      as it is exciting.  At least people here at Baidu think so.  As
      having diligently disclosed in the Prospectus of our recent
      Initial Public Offering, we believe there are at least 38 ways of
      saying "I" in Chinese.  It is important that we master all the
      ways of addressing oneself in Chinese because our users depend on
      us to address every one of their daily queries.  And trust us, pin
      pointing queries in the Chinese language is an art rather than a
      science.

      Our mission is to provide the best way for people to find
      information.  To do this we listen carefully to our users' needs
      and wants.  Have we collected all the Chinese web pages they want
      to see?  Are the pages current and up to date?  Are the search
      results closely related to their queries?  Did we return those
      search results instantly?  To improve user experience, we
      constantly make improvements to our products and services.  For
      example, we introduced "phonetic" or "pin-yin" search, which
      allows our users to type in Chinese keywords using English
      alphabets.  This feature is designed to skip the switching from
      English inputting to Chinese inputting and for when the user is
      not sure of the written form of a keyword.  Our users definitely
      notice the many little things that we do differently to ensure a
      simple and reliable search experience every time.

      In addition to serving individual users, we also serve as a media
      platform for online marketing customers.  We not only provide our
      customers easy access to one of the largest online audiences in

      China but also targeted groups with defined interests as indicated
      by queries.  Unlike traditional online advertising services, which
      charge by flat fee, our marketing products and services are
      performance based.  Our Pay for Performance model has taken the
      market by storm because it is cost effective and measurable.

      We know that a lot of interesting things are going on in the
      Internet space, but we don't want to lose focus.  China's Internet
      search industry is only a newly discovered territory.  We see vast
      untapped grounds in our home base and we believe there are still
      plenty of prizes to be claimed by the best players.

   Of course, for IETF engineers, what would be of most interest is
   "what has Baidu done that is surprising".  How does Baidu accommodate
   scale in applications?  How does Baidu build its datacenter network
   infrastructure - off-the-shelf hardware, low end or high end, custom
   very simple hardware with control in software (like Google)?  What
   are its IPv6 plans?  Implementations?  For background - how many
   queries does it deal with per hour?  How many independent users?
   What is the size of datacenter and network?

   Unfortunately the Baidu-owned facilities here have limited space.  At
   the current stage of organization they offer a 20 person group visit
   from 6PM to 8PM on Monday night during IETF-79, with more visits
   possible depending on interest.  Go to the Wiki at
   http://visitbaidu.wikispaces.com/ to sign up.  No guarantee to get
   answers to all those questions (thanks, Ralph), but it should be
   interesting.

1.2.  Alibaba --Chinese E-Commerce Site

   Quotation from its website.

      Alibaba.com (HKSE:1688), a member of the Alibaba Group of
      companies, is one of the world's premier e-commerce brands and the
      number one online marketplace for global and domestic China trade.
      We provide an efficient, trusted platform connecting small and
      medium-sized buyers and suppliers from around the world.  Our
      international marketplace (www.alibaba.com) focuses on global
      importers and exporters and our China marketplace
      (www.alibaba.com.cn) focuses on suppliers and buyers trading
      domestically in China.  Together our marketplaces form a community
      of more than 24 million registered users from over 200 countries
      and regions.

      Our operational headquarters is based in Hangzhou in eastern
      China.  We have field sales and marketing offices in more than 30
      cities in China, Hong Kong, Switzerland and the United States.

      The company had more than 4,400 full-time employees as of June 30,
      2007.

1.3.  China Telecom

   China Telecom's official website is at
   http://en.chinatelecom.com.cn/.
   http://www.chinatelecom-h.com/eng/company/company_overview.htm
   provides more information.  China Telecommunications Corporation is
   an extra-large State-owned telecom operator in China, Global Partner
   of World Expo 2010 Shanghai, and was selected into the Top 500 Global
   Corporations for many consecutive years.  China Telecom provides
   integrated information services including fixed-line telephone,
   mobile, Internet connection and application services.  By the end of
   2009, China Telecom had 194 million fixed-line telephone subscribers,
   62.36 million mobile (CDMA) subscribers, and 61.75 million fixed
   broadband customers.

   China Telecom is caught between the oncoming wave of potential new
   subscribers and the wall of a limited and rapidly shrinking supply of
   IPv4 addresses.  Clearly China Telecom's network and services must
   eventually migrate to IPv6.  Along the way, we have done a lot of
   experimenting for the SHANGHAI EXPO, plan more experiments for the
   ShenZhen World University Games, and have other work in progress in
   our current network.  Out of all this we hope to determine the best
   way for us to make the transition to IPv6.

1.4.  China Mobile

   China Mobile's main web site is at
   http://www.chinamobileltd.com/?lang=en.  IETF particpants will also
   be interested in http://labs.chinamobile.com/.

   China Mobile is a major mobile network operator, with 564 million
   subscribers, currently growing at a rate in the order of 1% per
   month.  To assure continued revenue growth as market penetration
   approaches its limit, China Mobile has been deploying 3GPP
   technology.  Currently about 2.38 percent of the operator's
   subscribers use that technology.  In August alone, China Mobile added
   1,585,000 3GPP subscribers, bringing the current total to 13,419,000.

   China Mobile is looking to mobile data services for future revenue
   gains.  Mobile data services currently include mobile payments, music
   downloads, reading (book downloads), news, mailbox, Fetion (their
   instant messaging brand) and broadcast video.  They also provide
   Internet search services in partnership with content providers such
   as news agencies.  By their nature, these services require
   communication between the mobile subscriber and a third party

   application or content provider.  Given the importance of these
   services to China Mobile's business, their IPv6 transition plans have
   to ensure continuity of service to the third party servers regardless
   of the IP version they run.

   At the subscriber end, mobile handsets are typically replaced within
   two to three years after purchase, apparently putting an upper limit
   on how long it will take to make IPv6 the preferred protocol for the
   majority of subscribers.  One factor that has to be considered is the
   use of mobile data access to provide access for personal computers
   tethered to the mobile terminal.  China Mobile is expecting to
   improve its deployment of this "tethering" service.

   As a further complication for the migration to IPv6, the China Mobile
   is facing a major upgrade of its access networks from the older 3GPP
   technology to LTE ("Long Term Evolution").  LTE flattens out the
   access network by bringing the IP edge closer to the user equipment.
   LTE will provide higher data rates, opening up the possibilities for
   improved services and increased revenue from them.

   China Mobile has convened the first Conference on the Post-LTE Mobile
   Internet Architectural Revolution (MIRACLE) on November 4th-5th 2010
   in Beijing, just ahead of the first IETF meeting in China.  As the
   Mobile Internet is being deployed, the world needs time to sit down
   and reflect on its evolution and architectural design.  Whether and
   how the Mobile Internet will be different from the current Internet
   architecture, what are the major demands for its architectural
   evolution, and what will be the enabling frameworks and technologies
   for its evolution are all key questions that challenge us and
   motivated us to initiate this meeting.

   In this meeting, the industrial and academic world will have the
   opportunity to discuss the requirements on the Mobile Internet
   architecture, the start-of-the-art technologies for its
   implementation, and future developments and trends for these
   frameworks and technologies.  The conference is composed of seven
   sessions:

   o  Worldwide Architecture Research Progress,

   o  IPv6 and Mobility Architecture,

   o  Content/Data Oriented Networking,

   o  Mobile Internet Architecture Evolution,

   o  Global Internet Architecture Evolution,

   natural disaster relief and educational aid programs.  For example,
   during China's Sichuan earthquake in 2008, ZTE quickly set up an
   Earthquake Relief Command Department to carry out communication
   relief work.  It also donated 10 million RMB to establish China's
   largest Special Fund for Children Care aimed at helping children to
   continue their education and undertaking reconstruction work in
   disaster-stricken regions.  In addition, it donated 20 million RMB in
   cash and materials to aid victims of the Pacific tsunami and
   earthquake in South Asia in 2004.

   Moving forward, ZTE will continue its ongoing commitment in the
   telecommunications field, aiming to be a world-class excellent
   enterprise in the near future.

2.  Odds and Ends

2.1.  CRH (China Railway High-speed)

   An excerpt from
   http://blog.hjenglish.com/shinsh/archive/2010/03/02/1542148.html:

   "Beijing's newest train station looks like a modern airport and a
   ride on its bullet train is nearly as fast as taking a plane.
   China's high-speed trains have come a long way from the steam engines
   that once chugged into the capital before economic reforms in the
   1980s transformed long-distance transportation.

      'This is how the majority of people travel across China.  All
      trains like this go as slow as 55 km/h.  When it's crowded, it's
      standing room only.'  And the journey can take days.

   "But that's no longer the only option.  China is now home to the
   world's fastest train, hurtling from Wuhan to Guangzhou at up to 200
   km/h.

      'This train is so fast.  It's threatened airline tickets sales.
      China's southern airlines are struggling to compete on this
      particular route as high speed railways changed the way Chinese
      people travel across this vast country.'

   "China is spinning a web of high-speed railways with faster
   connections than ever before.  The government plans to extend 3,000
   current km of high-speed track to 12,000 by 2012, estimated cost $360
   billion or 60% of the stimulus package China enacted to combat the
   financial crisis."

2.2.  A Bit of Vocabulary

   Here are a few words to help you survive in China:

   o  Hello: "Ni Hao" (pronounced "knee how")

   o  Thank you: "Xie Xie" (pronounced "shieh shieh")

   o  Please: "Qing" (pronounced "ching")

   o  Beer: "Pi jiu"

   o  Tea: "Cha"

2.3.  Chinese Culture

   Quoted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_China:

   The culture of China is one of the world's oldest and most complex.
   The area in which the culture is dominant covers a large geographical
   region in eastern Asia with customs and traditions varying greatly
   between towns, cities and provinces.  It is a global village
   nowadays, so the culture of China is mixing with the global culture.
   The following tables show the difference between "China" and "West"
   cultures, though how much the difference shows depends on the
   personalities involved.

2.4.  Chinese Musical Instruments

   Citation from
   http://www.visitourchina.com/guide/traditional_chinese_music.htm:

   "In China, musical instruments are classified according to the
   material, not according to the generated sound or the construction
   method like in the West.  Traditionally, there exist eight different
   types of instruments.  Already during the late Warring States period,
   but especially during Han Dynasty, the theory of the Five Phases or
   Elements (wuxing) and correlation of beings and appearances was very
   popular.  The correlation also includes music instruments.  Bamboo
   flutes are used when the spring begins, summer is the time of string
   instruments (silk), bronze bells are the instruments of the autumn,
   and in wintertime, drums are sounding."

   The closest Chinese musical instruments shop to the hotel is in the
   Xinjiekou Building.  It is probably 15 minutes from the hotel to
   Xinjiekou in driving distance.

2.5.  Peking Opera

   Quoted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_opera.

   "Beijing opera or Peking opera is a form of traditional Chinese
   theatre which combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance and
   acrobatics.  It arose in the late 18th century and became fully
   developed and recognized by the mid-19th century.  The form was
   extremely popular in the Qing Dynasty court and has come to be
   regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China.  Major
   performance troupes are based in Beijing and Tianjin in the north,
   and Shanghai in the south.  The art form is also enjoyed in Taiwan,
   where it is known as Guoju.  It has also spread to other countries
   such as the United States and Japan."

   Starting from the meeting venue, Shangri-La Hotel, here is the
   information to go and watch Peking Opera and other acrobatics:

2.6.  Chinese Kung-Fu

   The citation is from
   http://www.chinatravel.com/facts/chinese-kung-fu/.

   "Kung-Fu, (also known as wushu or martial arts) is one of the most
   well known examples of traditional Chinese culture.  It is probably
   one of the earliest and longest lasting sports which utilize both
   brawn and brain.  The theory of Kung-Fu is based upon classical
   Chinese philosophy.  Over its long history it has developed as a
   unique combination of exercise, practical self-defense, self-
   discipline and art.  In sports like track and field, ball sports,
   weightlifting, and boxing, an athlete typically has to retire from
   full participation in his 30s.  Injuries sustained during years of
   active sport participation at a young age can affect a person's
   health in later life.  In Chinese Kung-Fu, however, a distinction is
   made between 'external' and 'internal' Kung-Fu.  It is said that: 'In
   external Kung-Fu, you exercise your tendons, bones, and skin; in
   internal Kung-Fu, you train your spirit, your qi, and your mind.'"

   Starting from the meeting venue, Shangri-La Hotel, here is the
   information to go and watch a display of Chinese Kung-Fu.

      Red Theater

      Place: Tiyuguan Road north, in South-east second ring,

      No. 44, Happy Avenue, (west to the second ring east south's Bright
      Bridge),

      Chongwen District

   It will take 40 minutes departing from the meeting venue by car.


3.  Food and Restaurants

   The philosophy of modern Chinese eating is to eat whatever and
   whenever you would like to eat.  There is no fixed sequence like one
   starter, one or two main dishes, one dessert, one coffee.  You could
   have many main dishes in China!

   What strikes one first in a bird's eye view of Beijing proper is a
   vast tract of golden roofs flashing brilliantly in the sun with
   purple walls occasionally emerging amid them and a stretch of
   luxuriant tree leaves flanking on each side.  That is the former

   twenty-four emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties ruled China for
   some 500 years - from 1420 to 1911.  The Ming Emperor Yong Le, who
   usurped the throne from his nephew and made Beijing the capital,
   ordered its construction, on which approximately 10,000 artists and a
   million workmen toiled for 14 years from 1406 to 1420.  At present,
   the Palace is an elaborate museum that presents the largest and most
   complete ensemble of traditional architecture and more than 900,000
   pieces of court treasures from all of China's dynasties.

   world.

   Starting out in the east on the banks of the Yalu River in Liaoning
   Province, the Wall stretches westwards for 12,700 kilometers to
   Jiayuguan in the Gobi desert, and is thus known as the Ten Thousand
   Li Wall in China.  The Wall climbs up and downs, twists and turns
   along the ridges of the Yanshan and Yinshan Mountain Chains through
   five provinces - Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu - and
   two autonomous regions - Ningxia and Inner Mongolia, spanning all of
   the northern China.

   In Beijing, two regular Great Wall scenic sites (Badaling and Mutian
   Valley) are secure, also very famous.

   handicraft, jewelry, antique, calligraphy and painting, Beijing roast
   duck and characteristic snacks, etc.

   The construction of Silk Street began on 6 June 2004, and was
   completed on 6 January 2005.  The market is well served with public
   transport.  The entrance of the subway comes through the inner
   building.  Highways radiate in all directions.  Several decades of
   station wagons can park around the square.  Meanwhile there is ample
   parking space underground.  The operating facilities include a fire
   protection monitoring and control system; a monitoring and control
   system to ensure public security, infrared ray monitoring system,
   broadcasting system, mobile phone beaconage system and digital
   network system.  All these systems can help to guarantee the full and
   safe operation of Silk Street.  The central air conditioning and
   indoor illumination provide the customers with a comfortable shopping
   environment.  Moreover, we have an infirmary, a reception room for
   foreign guests, and 24 hour ATM, bank and post office.

   Silk Street engaged a well-known domestic real property management
   company - Guibinlou Real Property - to manage the whole shopping
   mall.  Silk Street has made great effort to organize the management
   group.  They engaged talents to make sure the management is
   harmonious and viewed as legitimate.  The establishment of the
   Merchant Management Committee has built up a whole system including
   quality, service and communication.  In fact, the committee
   standardized and monitored the operation of the market.

   Silk Street also made great effort to cooperate with many other
   companies, including national and international enterprises, travel
   agencies etc.  We have a nice hope to build a perfect market for all
   the guests.

   Silk Street will join hands with its merchants and the whole society,
   undertaking the new task of fashion-esteem, culture-spread, brand-
   establishment, and building a "Century-Old Shop", achieving a
   century's brilliance in an international shopping mall!

4.2.  Shanghai

   Shanghai is in the east of China.

   World Expositions are galleries of human inspirations and thoughts.
   Since 1851 when the Great Exhibition of Industries of All Nations was
   held in London, the World Expositions have attained increasing
   prominence as grand events for economic, scientific, technological
   and cultural exchanges, serving as an important platform for
   displaying historical experience, exchanging innovative ideas,
   demonstrating esprit de corps and looking to the future.

   With a long civilization, China favors international exchange and
   loves world peace.  China owes its successful bid for the World
   Exposition in 2010 to the international community's support for and
   confidence in its reform and opening-up.  The Exposition will be the
   first registered World Exposition in a developing country, giving
   expression to the expectations that the world's people place on
   China's future development.

   So what will Expo 2010 Shanghai China deliver to the world?  There is
   no doubt the Chinese people will present to the world a successful,
   splendid and unforgettable exposition.

   Expo 2010 Shanghai China will be a great event to explore the full
   potential of urban life in the 21st century and a significant period
   in urban evolution.  Fifty-five percent of the world population is
   expected to live in cities by the year 2010.  The prospect of future
   urban life, a subject of global interest, concerns all nations,
   developed or less developed, and their people.  Being the first World
   Exposition on the theme of city, Exposition 2010 will attract
   governments and people from across the world, focusing on the theme
   "Better City, Better Life."  For its 184 days, participants will
   display urban civilization to the full extent, exchange their
   experiences of urban development, disseminate advanced notions on
   cities and explore new approaches to human habitat, lifestyle and
   working conditions in the new century.  They will learn how to create
   an eco-friendly society and maintain the sustainable development of
   human beings.

   Expo 2010 Shanghai China will centre on innovation and interaction.
   Innovation is the soul, while cultural interaction is an important
   mission of the World Expositions.  In the new era, Expo 2010 Shanghai
   China will contribute to human-centred development, scientific and
   technological innovation, cultural diversity and win-win cooperation

   for a better future, thus composing a melody with the key notes of
   highlighting innovation and interaction in the new century.

   Expo 2010 Shanghai China will also be a grand international
   gathering.  On the one hand, we shall endeavor to attract about 200
   nations and international organizations to take part in the
   exhibition as well as 70 million visitors from home and abroad,
   ensuring the widest possible participation in the history of the
   World Expositions.  On the other hand, we will put Expo 2010 Shanghai
   China in a global perspective and do our best to encourage the
   participation and gain the understanding and support of various
   countries and peoples, in order to turn Expo 2010 Shanghai China into
   a happy reunion of people from all over the world.

   In addition, Expo 2010 Shanghai China will offer a wonderful
   opportunity for cross-culture dialogues.  Before the conclusion of
   the Exposition, a "Shanghai Declaration" will be issued.  This
   declaration, hopefully a milestone in the history of the World
   Expositions, will epitomize the insights to be offered by the
   participants and embody people's ideas for future cooperation and
   development and extensive common aspirations, thereby leaving a rich
   spiritual legacy of urban development to people throughout the world.

4.3.  Hong Kong and Macao

   If you want to experience the mixture eastern and western sightseeing
   and cultures, you can go to Hong Kong and Macao in the south of
   China.

   Hong Kong has something for everyone.  You can join the gastronomes
   at ritzy restaurants or slurp noodles at neighborhood food-stands;
   marvel at the bright lights on a harbor ferry cruise or explore the
   higgledy-piggledy laneways where the locals hang out.

   If you go to Macao, don't forget to go to the Mazu Temple and the
   biggest casino.

4.4.  Xi'an

   Xi'an is in the west of China.

   The Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses are the most significant
   archeological excavations of the 20th century.  Work is ongoing at
   this site, which is around 1.5 kilometers east of Emperor Qin Shi
   Huang's Mausoleum, Lintong County, Shaanxi province.  It is a sight
   not to be missed by any visitor to China.

   The museum covers an area of 16,300 square meters, divided into three

   sections: No. 1 Pit, No. 2 Pit, and No. 3 Pit respectively.  They
   were tagged in the order of their discoveries.  No. 1 Pit is the
   largest, first opened to the public on China's National Day, 1979.
   There are columns of soldiers at the front, followed by war chariots
   at the back.

   No. 2 Pit, found in 1976, is 20 meters northeast of No. 1 Pit. It
   contained over a thousand warriors and 90 chariots of wood.  It was
   unveiled to the public in 1994.Archeologists came upon No. 3 Pit also
   in 1976, 25 meters northwest of No. 1 Pit. It looked like to be the
   command center of the armed forces.  It went on display in 1989, with
   68 warriors, a war chariot and four horses.

   Altogether over 7,000 pottery soldiers, horses, chariots, and even
   weapons have been unearthed from these pits.  Most of them have been
   restored to their former grandeur.  The Terracotta Warriors and
   Horses is a sensational archeological find of all times.  It has put
   Xian on the map for tourists.  It was listed by UNESCO in 1987 as one
   of the world cultural heritages.

4.5.  Guilin

   Guilin is in the south of China.  It is also the birth place of the
   mother of the author.

   The mountain and the water in GL top the world.

   Guilin is a key tourist city of well-known culture and history in
   China.  Its tourism develops rapidly.  Either comprehensive
   recipience, scale of tourist industry, quality of tourist service or
   infrastructure, subsidiary facilities, leading function come to a
   higher level and grade.  From 1980 to 1997, 60 million tourists from
   more than 150 countries and areas and tens of state leaders came to
   Guilin for a visit, deeply impressed and giving sincere praises.
   Guilin has developed into one of the well-known and first chosen
   tourist resorts.

   Be careful with your heart :) I know from TV that an American guy
   decided to marry a girl from Yangshuo, Guilin and live there when he
   came to visit Guilin, due to the beautiful mountain, water and the
   girl.

   Chinese bare-handed and weapons combat forms judged to a set of
   contemporary aesthetic criteria for points.

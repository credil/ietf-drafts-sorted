    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes an alternative 6rd deployment model to that of 
      RFC 5969.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 
      networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd requires
      support by a device (the 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which must also be
      assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model described in this document
      initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an operator-owned gateway collocated with
      the operator's IPv4 network edge, rather than from customer equipment.  The
      advantages of this approach are that it requires no modification to customer
      equipment and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  
      The latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth
      environment.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>   6rd ([RFC5969]) provides a transition tool for connecting IPv6
      devices across an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network, at which point the
      packets can be routed natively.  The network topology is shown in
      <xref target="fig_topol"/>.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="fig_topol"/>, the CE is the customer edge router.  It
      is provisioned with a delegated IPv6 prefix, but also with an IPv4 address
      so that it is reachable through the IPv4 network.  If a public IPv4 address 
      is provisioned to every customer, it will aggravate the pressure due to
      IPv4 address shortage for operators faced with a high rate of growth in 
      the number of broadband subscribers to their network.  The use of private
      addresses with 6rd avoids this particular difficulty, but brings other
      complications. </t>

			<t>Consider an operator facing a high subscriber growth rate.  As a result
      of this growth rate, the operator faces pressure on its stock of available
      public IPv4 addresses.  For this reason, the operator is motivated to offer 
      IPv6 access as quickly as possible.  <xref target="fig_netCtxt"/> shows the
      sort of network situation envisioned in the present document.</t>

        <postamble>Specialized GW and BR functions are described in the next 
        section.</postamble>
      </figure>
     
      <t>The backbone network will be the first part of the operator's network
      to support IPv6.  The metro network is not so easily upgraded to support
      IPv6 since many devices need to be modified and there may be some impact 
      to existing services.  Thus any means of providing IPv6 access has to 
      minimize the changes required to devices in the metro network.</t>

      <t>In contrast to the situation described for basic 6rd 
      <xref target="RFC5569"/>, the operator is assumed to have no control over
      the capabilities of the IP devices on the customer premises.  As a result,
      the operator cannot assume that any of these devices are capable of 
      supporting 6rd. </t>

      <t>If the customer equipment is in bridged mode and IPv6 is deployed to 
      sites via a Service Provider's (SP's) IPv4 network, the IPv6-only host
      needs a IPv6 address to visit the IPv6 service.  In this scenario, 6to4
      or 6rd can be used.  However, each IPv6-only host may need one 
      corresponding IPv4 address when using public IPv4 address in 6to4 or 6rd,
      which puts great address pressure on the operators.</t>
      
      <t>If the CPE in the above figure is acting in bridging mode, each host
      behind it needs to be directly assigned an IPv6 prefix so it can access
      IPv6 services. If the CPE is acting in routing mode, only the CPE needs
      to be assigned an IPv6 prefix, and it delegates prefixes to the hosts
      behind it.</t>

      <t>If the Gateway supports IPv4 only, then an IPv4 address must also 
      be assigned to each host (bridging mode) or to the CPE (routing mode).
      Both cases, but bridging mode in particular, put pressure on the 
      provider's stock of IPv4 addresses.</t>
      
      <t>If the Gateway is dual stack, an arrangement may be possible whereby
      all communication between the Gateway and the customer site uses IPv6 
      and the need to assign IPv4 addresses to customer devices is avoided.
      A possible solution is presented in the next section.</t>

    <section anchor="propSol" title="Proposed Solution">

      <t>For basic 6rd <xref target="RFC5969"/>, the 6rd CE initiates
      the 6-in-4 tunnel to the 6rd Border Relay to carry its IPv6
      traffic.  To avoid the requirement for customer premises equipment 
      to fulfill this role, it is necessary to move the tunneling function
      to a network device. This document identifies a functional element
      termed the 6rd Gateway to perform this task.  In what follows, the 6rd
      Gateway and 6rd Border Relay are referred to simply as the Gateway and
      Border Relay respectively.</t>

      <t>The functions of Gateway are:
     
      <list style="symbols">
     	  <t>to generate and allocate Gateway initiated 6rd delegated prefixes 
     	  for IPv6-capable customer devices, as described in 
     	  <xref target="prefix"/>.</t>
         
        <t>to forward outgoing IPv6 packets through a tunnel to a Border Relay,
        which extracts and forwards them to an IPv6 network as for 6rd;</t>
         
        <t>to extract incoming IPv6 packets tunneled from the Border Relay
        and forward them to the correct user device.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>In the proposed solution, there is only one tunnel initiated from 
      each Gateway to the Border Relay, which greatly reduces the number of
      tunnels the Border Relay has to handle.  The deployment scenario
      consistent with the problem statement in <xref target="probStat"/>
      collocates the Gateway with the IP edge of the access network.  This 
      is shown in <xref target="fig_netCtxt"/> above, and is the typical placement 
      of the Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in a fixed broadband network.  
      By assumption, the metro network beyond the BNG is IPv4. Transport
      between the customer site and the Gateway is over layer 2.</t>

      <t>The elements of the proposed solution are these:

      <list style="symbols">
     	  <t>The IPv6 prefix assigned to the customer site contains the
     	  compressed IPv4 address of the network-facing side of the Gateway,
     	  plus a manually provisioned or Gateway-generated customer site 
     	  identifier.  This is illustrated in <xref target="fig_addrFmt"/>
     	  below.</t>
    
        <t>The Border Relay is able to route incoming IPv6 packets to the
        correct Gateway by extracting the compressed Gateway address from 
        the IPv6 destination address of the incoming packet, expanding it 
        to a full 32-bit IPv4 address, and setting it as the destination 
        address of the encapsulated packet.</t>
    
        <t>The Gateway can route incoming packets to the correct link after
        decapsulation using a mapping from either the full IPv6 prefix or 
        the customer site identifier extracted from that prefix to the 
        appropriate link.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      

      <section anchor="prefix" title="Prefix Delegation">

	      <t>Referring back to <xref target="fig_netCtxt"/>, prefix assignment to 
	      the customer equipment occurs in the normal fashion through the Gateway/IP
	      edge, using either DHCPv6 or SLAAC.  <xref target="fig_addrFmt"/> 
	      illustrates the structure of the assigned prefix, and how the components 
	      are derived, within the context of a complete address.</t>

          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The common prefix, i.e., the first p bits of the GI 6rd delegated 
        prefix, is configured in the Gateway.  This part of the prefix is 
        common across multiple customers and multiple Gateways.  Multiple 
        common prefix values may be used in a network either for service 
        separation or for scalability.</t>

        <t>The Gateway Identifier is equal to the o low-order bits of the Gateway
        IPv4 address on the virtual link to the Border Relay.  The number of bits
        o is equal to 32 - IPv4MaskLen, where the latter is the length of the IPv4
        prefix from which the Gateway IPv4 addresses are derived.  The value of
        IPv4MaskLen is configured in both the Gateways and the Border Relays.</t>

        <t>The Customer Site Index is effectively a sequence number assigned to an
        individual customer site served by the Gateway.  The value of the index for
        a given customer site must be unique across the Gateway. The length n of 
        the Customer Site Index is provisioned in the Gateway, and must be large 
        enough to accommodate the number of customer sites that the Gateway is 
        expected to serve.</t>
        
        <t>To give a numerical example, consider a 6rd domain containing ten million
        IPv6-capable customer devices (a rather high number given that 6rd is meant
        for the early stages of IPv6 deployment).  The estimated number of 6rd 
        Gateways needed to serve this domain would be in the order of 3,300, each
        serving 30,000 customer devices. Assuming best-case compression for the
        Gateway addresses, the Gateway Identifier field has length o = 12 bits.  
        If IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling is being used, this best case is more likely 
        to be achievable than it would be if the IPv4 addresses belonged to the
        customer devices. More controllably, the customer device index has length
        n = 15 bits.</t>
 
        <t>Overall, these figures suggest that the length p of the common prefix 
        can be 29 bits for a /56 delegated prefix, or 21 bits if /48 delegated
        prefixes need to be allocated.</t>

      <section anchor="diffs" title="Relevant Differences From Basic 6rd">

        <t>A number of the points in <xref target="RFC5969"/> apply with the 
        simple substitution of the Gateway for the 6rd CE.  When it comes to
        configuration, the definition of IPv4MaskLen changes, and there are 
        other differences as indicated in the previous section.  Since special
        configuration of customer equipment is not required, the 6rd DHCPv6 
        option is inapplicable.</t>

        <t>Since the link for the customer site to the network now extends only 
        as far as the Gateway, Neighbour Unreachability Detection on the part of
        customer devices is similarly limited in scope.</t>

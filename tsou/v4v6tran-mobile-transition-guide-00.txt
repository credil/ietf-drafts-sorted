Internet-Draft         Mobile Operator Transition         September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The use case for migration of a large mobile network to IPv6 is
   described in [ID_mobile_use_case].  That document provides an
   introduction to the network architecture and looks at possible
   strategies and tools for migration. 3GPP has decided to use Gateway-
   Initiated DS-lite [ID_GI_DS_lite] as the primary tool for subscriber
   migration.  Details as far as they have been thought out are provided
   in [3GPP_TR_23_975].  However, they cover only a small part of the
   total problems.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   This document contains no requirements language.


2.  Steps In the Transition Strategy

   The transition to IPv6 must be carried out over a number of different
   segments within the total network:

   o  the operator's operational support systems, including AAA;

   o  the operator's private IP network;

   o  the portal to the operator's proprietary content and applications;

   o  the user devices;

   o  portals to the partner content and application providers.

   These are listed in what is probably the preferred order for making
   the transition, but in fact the operator will want to carry out a
   number of activities in parallel.

2.1.  Migration Of Operational Support Systems and AAA

   The transition to IPv6 may have a number of consequences for AAA and
   other support systems.  First and most obvious, systems must be set
   up for the provisioning of IPv6 addresses and associated
   configuration data.  AAA may be affected if the subscriber's IPv4
   address has been used as a correlator for accounting records.  Device
   provisioning and configuration within the network to handle IPv6 has
   to be tracked so that the engineering department can monitor the
   progress of the necessary network upgrades and maintenance has the
   information it needs to carry out routine testing and restoration
   procedures.  New maintenance procedures have to be developed.

   Given the time it takes to develop new support systems or modify old
   ones, it is to be hoped that the most critical areas of the effort
   have already been identified and are well on the way to being
   implemented before any of the other activities begin.

2.2.  Transition of the Private Internal Network

   The private internal network includes signalling links between
   network devices, but also the IP layer over which tunnels carry user
   packets.

   Conversion of the private internal network to pure IPv6 operation
   should be an early objective, for at least two reasons.  In the first
   place, it provides the operator with experience that will be helpful
   when making the transition in other segments of the network.  In
   addition, it relieves the operator of one source of demand for IPv4
   addresses, at least some of which must be public to allow
   communication with other operators.

   Unfortunately, the need for IPv4 addresses will not go away
   immediately.  While the transition is in progress, until upgrades are
   completed, a transition mechanism is needed to allow the upgraded
   equipment to interoperate with the equipment that has not yet been
   upgraded.  The most obvious mechanism is to use dual-stack operation
   with the devices being configured to use IPv6 whenever possible.  It
   may be possible to do the upgrades in blocks of devices, where
   relatively few of the devices in a block need to communicate with
   devices outside the block.  These boundary devices will continue to
   need IPv4 addresses until the other blocks with which they
   communicate have been upgraded, but communications in the interior of
   the block can use IPv6 and so interior devices need no IPv4 address.

   Because IPv6 usage in the private network will build up as quickly as
   the operator can upgrade the network equipment, an IPv6 version of
   the internal DNS system will be needed early on.  It seems likely, in
   fact, that the most efficient mode of operation will be a dual-stack
   DNS containing both A and AAAA records.

      A key use of this DNS system is to allow the Serving Gateway to
      locate a PDN Gateway providing access to the core network that the
      subscriber will use.  This may be operator's own core network or
      the subscriber's home network.

2.3.  Migrating the Portal to the Operator's Proprietary Content and
      Applications

   The operator needs to build up the availabilty of IPv6-accessible
   applications and content as quickly as possible, to reduce the IPv4

   traffic on the network and thereby reduce the demand for public IPv4
   addresses.  One way to do this is to make the operator's own content
   and applications IPv6-accessible early on in the transition period.

   As usual, because of the time it will take to transition all users,
   IPv4 access to the content and applications must continue to be
   provided, until the last Windows XP computer ceases to be tethered to
   a mobile device for Internet access.  In the early days, until the
   content can be fully converted, protocol translation may be used to
   allow access to IPv6 users.  Once the content and applications have
   been converted to IPv6, dual stack operation will be possible and the
   protocol converter (NAT64) can be removed.

2.4.  User Devices

   3GPP specifications for mobile devices have required dual stack
   support for at least a year (i.e., as of Release 8.)  The operator
   can help things along by requiring that new devices connecting to the
   operator's network conform to this requirement.  It will still take
   two or three years until the large majority of devices are capable of
   dual stack operation.

   The transition strategies considered in [3GPP_TR_23_975] relate
   specifically to how user traffic is carried.  That document offers
   four different scenarios, or strategies, for achieving transition.
   In the early stages, before a large portion of the content and
   applications accessed by users can be reached by IPv6, the most
   likely strategy will be to interpose Gateway-Initiated DS-lite
   [ID_GI_DS_lite] using a minimal set of private IPv4 addresses at the
   user devices and sharing public IPv4 addresses between multiple users
   using some system of block port allocation as proposed in
   [ID_natx4-log-reduction].

   When the operator converts a given area to Gateway-Initiated DS-lite
   access, a number of public IPv4 addresses are freed because of the
   introduction of address sharing.  This suggests that one strategy may
   be to introduce Gateway-Initiated DS-lite initially in high-growth
   areas, using the addresses thus freed to handle demand in lower-
   growth-rate areas until they can be converted.

   DNS access is an issue with Gateway-Initiated DS-lite.  The original
   DS-lite proposal had a point (the B4) at which all DNS queries could
   be intercepted and sent to an IPv6 DNS.  From here IPv4 queries could
   be forwarded to an IPv4 DNS, or the IPv6 DNS could maintain both AAAA
   and A records.  It is not so obvious that such interception can be
   carried out at the Gateway in Gateway-Initiated DS-lite, since the
   Gateway is essentially performing a layer 2 operation.
   [ID_GI_DS_lite] does not mention the issue.

2.5.  Portals to the Partner Content and  Application Providers

   As mentioned above, content conversion is the key to building up IPv6
   traffic and thereby relieving pressure on the supply of public IPv4
   addresses.  To some extent the operator may be able to solve this at
   a business level, through negotiations to encourage the content
   provider to convert.  However, technical solutions will also be
   necessary.

   One possible solution is to provide IPv6 access to the content
   provider's site by installing protocol translation for traffic
   between that site and IPv6 users.  This would have to be accompanied
   by the installation of AAAA records in DNS giving the address IPv6
   address via which the site is reachable.

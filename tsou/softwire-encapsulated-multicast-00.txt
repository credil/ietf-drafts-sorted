    A Generic Approach to Multicast Encapsulation In Support of IPv6

Abstract

   Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transition
   scenarios, where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports one
   IP version, but the host and Network B support a different IP
   version.  Suppose that the host wishes to access a multicast group
   which is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document specifies an
   approach that combines stateful translation for signalling,
   encapsulation of multicast content moving between Network B and the
   host, and native multicast routing in Network A to provide the host
   with its desired access.

1.  Introduction

   Transition scenarios have been explored in which an IPv6 host
   attached to an IPv4 network wishes to access content in an IPv6
   network, or conversely, an IPv4 host attached to an IPv6 network
   wishes to access content in an IPv4 network.  A long list of tools
   has been put forward for passing unicast content across the network
   in the middle based on tunneling.

   Some work has also been done on conveying multicast streams between
   IPv4 and IPv6 networks, in either direction.  Of particular interest
   is current work in [ID.softwire-dslite-multicast].  However, the
   present document differs from [ID.softwire-dslite-multicast] both in
   its degree of generality and in the detailed mechanism used for
   translation between IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses.  The present
   document does not restrict operation to specially constructed IPv6
   multicast addresses.  Instead it makes use of the fact that for a
   given network, it is unnecessary to map the complete universe of IPv6
   addresses into IPv4, but only those addresses actually being carried
   through the network.

   This document is adapted from [ID.behave-translated-multicast] and
   uses the same basic mechanism.  It requires additional bandwidth
   because of its use of encapsulation for the multicast content, but
   thereby avoids the need to translate the addressing of that content
   between IPv4 and IPv6 at the receiving end of the tunnel.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Problem Description

   We consider, as described in the previous section, a host supporting
   one IP version, say IPvx, attached to a provider network supporting a
   different version, say IPvy.  Obviously there has to be an adaptation
   function between the host and the network to make this work.  This
   document assumes that the adaptation function for unicast packets
   consists of tunneling combined with a suitable choice of destination
   address to steer the packets to the right border gateways.

   On the other side of the provider network, border gateways connect to
   neighbouring networks.  If a particular neighbouring network supports
   a different version of IP -- that is, IPvx, then the border gateway
   must also implement adaptation functions.  In particular, the unicast

Internet-Draft       Generic Multicast Encapsulation        January 2011


   adaptation function at the border gateway is complementary to the
   adaptation function at the host side.

   Multicast streams could simply be tunneled from the border to the
   host.  However, to save bandwidth, it is desirable to use the native
   multicast capabilities of the IPvy network so that paths can be
   shared as much as possible.  This implies three requirements on the
   multicast adaptation function:

   o  it has to enable the use of multicast signalling to build
      distribution trees in the IPvy network;

   o  it has to route multicast content through those distribution trees
      rather than directly across the network;

   o  by specific assumption of this document, it must encapsulate
      incoming IPvx packets before forwarding them to the distribution
      trees, and decapsulate outgoing packets before sending them
      onwards.

   The basic situation just described is illustrated in Figure 1.  The
   host-side adaptation functions MAY be implemented in the host itself,
   in a separate piece of equipment at the customer site (CPE-based
   approach), or at the provider edge (gateway initiated approach).  The
   border adaptation functions MUST be implemented in border gateways.

   The key assumption of this document is that when the host wishes to
   acquire a multicast stream rooted or sourced in the IPvx network, it
   knows only the IPvx address pair <Source, Group> (where the source



Tsou, et al.             Expires August 2, 2011                 [Page 4]

   MAY be wild-carded, i.e., for an any-source multicast group).

      It learns that address pair by means outside the scope of this
      specification (e.g., via the web or session signalling).

   As a result, for purposes of multicast signalling, the host-side
   multicast adaptation function (HMAF) needs to obtain a mapping
   between this IPvx address pair and the corresponding IPvy address
   pair used in the IPvy network to denote the same multicast stream.
   Similarly, the border multicast adaptation function (BMAF) needs this
   mapping both for purposes of multicast signalling and so that it can
   assign the right IPvy source and destination addresses to incoming
   IPvx multicast content.


3.  Proposed Solution

   The proposed solution consists of three elements:

   o  a stateful mapping function within the IPvy provider network that
      provides mappings between IPvx <Source, Group> address pairs and
      corresponding IPvy <Source, Group> address pairs denoting the same
      multicast flows;

   o  address pools of IPvy multicast and unicast addresses provisioned
      at the mapping function;

   o  a protocol that allows the HMAF and BMAF to request mappings from
      the mapping function.  PCP [ID.port-control-protocol] is a
      candidate for this protocol, but that decision needs further
      consideration.

3.1.  How It Works

   1.  Initial discovery and Join request

   The IPvx host discovers the <Source, Group> address pair of a
   multicast stream the user wants to receive.  The IPvx Host sends an
   MLDv2 [RFC3810] (for IPv6) or IGMPv3 [RFC3376] (for IPv4) Join
   request to the HMAF to acquire the stream.

   2. <Source, Group> Address Mapping At the HMAF

   The HMAF checks its cache of mappings to see if it already has a
   mapping between the IPvx <Source, Group> address pair received in the
   host request and a corresponding pair of IPvy addresses.  Failing to
   find a mapping, it sends a request for the required mapping to the
   mapping function.  The mapping function in turn checks whether it has



Tsou, et al.             Expires August 2, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Generic Multicast Encapsulation        January 2011


   already created the mapping.  If not, it assigns unicast and
   multicast IPvy addresses from its pool and records the mapping for
   further use.  In either case it returns the requested mapping to the
   HMAF, which caches it.  [Editor's Note: The transaction is carried
   out over a protocol to be specified in a later version of this
   document.]

   3.  Propagation Of the Join Request Into the IPvy Network

   Using the mapping it has received, the HMAF interworks from MLDv2 to
   IGMPv3 or vice versa, depending on whether the host supports IPv6 or
   IPv4.  It forwards the interworked Join request to the Provider IP
   Edge.

      If the HMAF is collocated with the Provider IP Edge, this
      interworking step is an internal operation.

   The Provider IP Edge acts on the received request by interworking it
   to a Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) [RFC4601]
   request and forwarding that request into the IPvy network, indicating
   the IPvy <Source, Group> address pair it was given and ensuring that
   it is on the multicast tree for the stream concerned.

   Assuming that the multicast tree for the requested stream is not
   joined at an earlier point in the provider network, eventually the
   PIM request finds its way to the BMAF.  It has been suggested that
   the border gateway in which the BMAF resides can be made a PIM-SM
   rendezvous point (RP) to ensure that requests for new groups reach
   it.

   4.  Remapping the <Source, Group> Address Pair At the BMAF

   The BMAF needs to map from the IPvy <Source, Group> address pair it
   received back to the corresponding IPvx address pair before
   propagating the PIM request into the IPvx network.  It sends a
   request to the mapping function to provide that mapping.  The mapping
   function already has this mapping, as a result of the original HMAF
   request, and returns it to the BMAF.  [Editor's note: protocol again
   to be specified later.  It can probably be the same as the one used
   by the HMAF.  Have to work out the security considerations.]

   5.  Propagation Of the PIM Request Into the IPvx Network

   The BMAF propagates translates the PIM request from IPvy to IPvx
   using the mapping it received.  It propagates the request into the
   IPvx network to complete the construction of the path for the
   requested multicast stream.  If path construction fails, the BMAF
   SHOULD notify the mapping function so it can mark the IPvx address

Internet-Draft       Generic Multicast Encapsulation        January 2011


   pair as bad (so it doesn't get remapped) while releasing the assigned
   IPvy addresses.

   6.  Transport of Multicast Media and Unicast RTCP Feedback

   If the BMAF receives a multicast packet from the IPvx network, it
   checks its cache of mappings to locate the IPvy source and group
   addresses corresponding to the incoming IPvx packet header.  It
   encapsulates the packet in an IPvy header containing the mapped IPvy
   source and with the destination set to the mapped IPvy group address.
   It then forwards the packet to the next hop in the multicast tree for
   that source and group.

   When the HMAF receives a multicast packet from the IPvy network, it
   decapsulates it and forwards it to the host.

   When the IPvx host sends unicast RTCP [RFC3550] feedback toward the
   source, the packets are handled like any other unicast packets.  That
   is, they are processed by the unicast adaptation functions rather
   than the HMAF and BMAF.

   Finally, if the IPvx Host emits multicast packets destined for an
   any-source multicast group, the processing of the packet is as just
   described, but with the roles of the HMAF and BMAF reversed.

   This draft started out as draft-tsou-softwire-6rd-multicast-00.
   Thanks to Joel Halpern for suggesting that it be written as a more
   general document, since it did not really depend on 6rd.  Thanks to
   Yiu Lee for further comments, which have been used to improve the

6.  Operational Considerations

   The proposal presented here incurs the operational expense of
   provisioning the multicast and unicast address pools at the mapping
   function.  Proper functioning of the system requires that the
   operator estimate the total number of different IPvx multicast groups
   and, for source-specific multicast, the total number of individual
   IPvx sources it wishes to enable simultaneously.

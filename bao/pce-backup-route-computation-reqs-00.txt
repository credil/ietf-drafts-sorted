  The Requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE) Application for
                              Backup Route

Abstract

   Backup route is another route for a service which will be used when
   working path fails.  Traditionally, this route is configured by
   operator manually and can't be updated when LSA changes.  This
   document improves this traditional usage, and PCE (Path Computation
   Element) is applied for backup route.

2.  Introduction

   Backup route is a very useful approach to achieve service
   restoration.  Traditionally, except primary route, operator also sets
   a group of routes (usually with priority), i.e. backup route set, for
   a service.  When the primary route fails, LSR can select a proper
   restoration route from backup route set.  By this way, faster
   restoration can be achieved.

   Since backup routes are pre-configured by management plane, it can't
   be updated when network state changes dynamically.  In some cases,
   e.g. a fiber on the backup route is cut, if operator can't update
   backup routes in time, the backup routes will become unavailable.
   Otherwise, generally the backup routes will be verified whether it is
   available before it is used to signal a connection.  This is also due
   to the problem that backup routes can't be updated timely.  And this
   will introduce another problem that time delay will affect service
   recovery.

   This document introduces a PCE-based backup route method, which uses
   PCE to update backup route at the policy of network management.  This
   method helps provider to offer better service for customer and avoids
   the unavailablity of backup routes.


3.  Application Model

   Figure 1 is an application model of pce-based backup route
   computation.  A user requests ingress LSR (PCC) for a service with
   backup route.  Then PCC requests PCE to compute a working path and a
   backup path.  PCE returns the results to PCC, and records that a
   backup route service is requested by the PCC.  When PCE receives a
   LSA change from IGP, it'll check if the backup route computed
   previously is affected.  If the backup route is affected, it will re-
   compute a new backup route, and send it to the PCC.

4.  Architecture Analysis and Requirements

4.1.  Architecture Analysis

   [RFC4655] introduced 5 PCE models which can be categorized according
   to whether PCE functionality is integrated into the network element.
   Under this methodology, two groups of PCE model, i.e. composite PCE
   and external PCE, is generated.

   For composite PCE, due to the resource limitation of the card, the
   power of CPU is relatively weak, so the PCE capability is also
   limited.  However, compared to composite PCE, external PCE has more
   resources (i.e. memory and CPU power etc), and it even can be
   presented as a dedicated server.  Therefore, external PCE is more
   powerful than composite PCE.  The application of backup route will
   increase compuataion burden to PCE.  Due to its powerful computation
   capability, external PCE is more adequate than composite PCE.
   However, if there is not much application of backup route, composite
   PCE can also operate well.

   [RFC4655] also describes stateful PCE and stateless PCE.  For
   statefull PCE, there is a strict synchronization between the PCE and
   not only the network states (in term of topology and resource
   information), but also the set of computed paths and reserved
   resources in use in the network.  Since stateful PCE can perceive the
   network state chang, so it can determine which computed path is
   affected.  Therefore, it is easier to applying backup route on
   stateful PCE.

   Furthermore, considering the PCE failure, if an implementation has a
   backup PCE, then the primary and backup PCE MUST keep strict
   synchronization.  And switching to the backup PCE can't affect the
   correctness of path computation

   However, the selection of PCE model, stateful PCE or stateless PCE is
   out of this document.  And the synchronization between primary and
   backup PCE is also out of this document, the operator can make a
   selection according to the network deployment.

4.2.  Requirements to PCC and PCE

   In order to support the backup route, PCC SHOULD be able to let PCE
   know that it needs backup route service.  Thereby, PCE can start
   backup service.  Otherwise, PCC SHOULD also be able to notify PCE
   that backup route service is cancelled, so PCE can stop backup route
   services.

   As for PCE, it SHOULD record backup route information, and maintain
   its state.  When network state changes, PCE SHOULD compute the
   affected backup routes and send a new route to PCC.  However, PCE MAY
   also compute backup routes in idle state to obtain the optimized
   paths.  The policy for PCE to compute backup routes SHOULD be able to
   be configured.

4.3.  Requirements to PCEP

   [RFC4657] gives detailed generic requirements for PCE communication
   protocol.  However, in order to support backup route, specific
   extensions to PCEP is required.  For PCReq, it SHOULD be possible for
   PCC to request backup route.  That is a mechanism is needed to make
   PCE know that PCC want a backup route service.

   When PCE receives a PCReq message with a backup route serivce
   request, it SHOULD perform path computation accroding to the required
   policy, e.g. node disjoint, link disjoint and SRLG disjoint etc.  And
   in the PCRep message, PCE SHOULD able to specify which one is pre-
   exsiting route, if PCC requests both primary route and backup route
   at the same time.  If PCE doesn't support backup route it SHOULD give
   a negative response, and the reason of the computation failure.  When
   network state changes, PCE SHOULD re-compute backup routes according
   the configured policy.  If a better backup route is found, PCE should
   send it to PCC.

   When PCC wants to cancel the backup route service, it can send a
   notify message to PCE.  Since current PCNtf message can't achieve
   this function, some extensions is needed.

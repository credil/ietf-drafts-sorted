      <t>This document describes Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
      formats for carrying each of MPEG-4 Audio and MPEG-4 Visual bitstreams
      without using MPEG-4 Systems. For the purpose of directly mapping MPEG-4
      Audio/Visual bitstreams onto RTP packets, it provides specifications for
      the use of RTP header fields and also specifies fragmentation rules. It
      also provides specifications for Media Type registration and
      the use of Session Description Protocol (SDP).</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>The RTP payload formats described in this document specify how MPEG-4
      Audio <xref target="14496-3" /> and MPEG-4 Visual streams <xref
      target="14496-2" /> <xref target="14496-2/Amd.1" /> are to be fragmented
      and mapped directly onto RTP packets.</t>

      <t>These RTP payload formats enable transport of MPEG-4 Audio/Visual
      streams without using the synchronization and stream management
      functionality of MPEG-4 Systems <xref target="14496-1" />. Such RTP
      payload formats will be used in systems that have intrinsic stream
      management functionality and thus require no such functionality from
      MPEG-4 Systems. H.323 terminals are an example of such systems, where
      MPEG-4 Audio/Visual streams are not managed by MPEG-4 Systems Object
      Descriptors but by H.245. The streams are directly mapped onto RTP
      packets without using the MPEG-4 Systems Sync Layer. Other examples
      are SIP and RTSP where Media Type and SDP are used. Media Type
      and SDP usages of the RTP payload formats described in this
      document are defined to directly
      specify the attribute of Audio/Visual streams (e.g., media type,
      packetization format and codec configuration) without using MPEG-4
      Systems. The obvious benefit is that these MPEG-4 Audio/Visual RTP
      payload formats can be handled in an unified way together with those
      formats defined for non-MPEG-4 codecs. The disadvantage is that
      interoperability with environments using MPEG-4 Systems may be
      difficult, hence, other payload formats may be better suited to those
      applications.</t>

      <t>The semantics of RTP headers in such cases need to be clearly
      defined, including the association with MPEG-4 Audio/Visual data
      elements. In addition, it is beneficial to define the fragmentation
      rules of RTP packets for MPEG-4 Video streams so as to enhance error
      resiliency by utilizing the error resilience tools provided inside the
      MPEG-4 Video stream.</t>

      <section title="MPEG-4 Visual RTP payload format" toc="default">
        <t>MPEG-4 Visual is a visual coding standard with many new features:
        high coding efficiency; high error resiliency; multiple, arbitrary
        shape object-based coding; etc. <xref target="14496-2" />. It covers a
        wide range of bitrate from scores of Kbps to several Mbps. It also
        covers a wide variety of networks, ranging from those guaranteed to be
        almost error-free to mobile networks with high error rates.</t>

        <t>With respect to the fragmentation rules for an MPEG-4 Visual
        bitstream defined in this document, since MPEG-4 Visual is used for a
        wide variety of networks, it is desirable not to apply too much
        restriction on fragmentation, and a fragmentation rule such as "a
        single video packet shall always be mapped on a single RTP packet" may
        be inappropriate. On the other hand, careless, media unaware
        fragmentation may cause degradation in error resiliency and bandwidth
        efficiency. The fragmentation rules described in this document are
        flexible but manage to define the minimum rules for preventing
        meaningless fragmentation while utilizing the error resilience
        functionalities of MPEG-4 Visual.</t>

        <t>The fragmentation rule recommends not to map more than one VOP in
        an RTP packet so that the RTP timestamp uniquely indicates the VOP
        time framing. On the other hand, MPEG-4 video may generate VOPs of
        very small size, in cases with an empty VOP (vop_coded=0) containing
        only VOP header or an arbitrary shaped VOP with a small number of
        coding blocks. To reduce the overhead for such cases, the
        fragmentation rule permits concatenating multiple VOPs in an RTP
        packet. (See fragmentation rule (4) in section 3.2 and marker bit and
        timestamp in section 3.1.)</t>

        <t>While the additional media specific RTP header defined for such
        video coding tools as H.261 or MPEG-1/2 is effective in helping to
        recover picture headers corrupted by packet losses, MPEG-4 Visual has
        already error resilience functionalities for recovering corrupt
        headers, and these can be used on RTP/IP networks as well as on other
        networks (H.223/mobile, MPEG-2/TS, etc.). Therefore, no extra RTP
        header fields are defined in this MPEG-4 Visual RTP payload
        format.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MPEG-4 Audio RTP payload format" toc="default">
        <t>MPEG-4 Audio is an audio standard that integrates many
        different types of audio coding tools. Low-overhead MPEG-4 Audio
        Transport Multiplex (LATM) manages the sequences of audio data with
        relatively small overhead. In audio-only applications, then, it is
        desirable for LATM-based MPEG-4 Audio bitstreams to be directly mapped
        onto RTP packets without using MPEG-4 Systems.</t>

        <t>While LATM has several multiplexing features as follows;
          <list hangIndent="0" style="symbols">
            <t>Carrying configuration information with audio data,</t>
            <t>Concatenation of multiple audio frames in one audio stream,</t>
            <t>Multiplexing multiple objects (programs),</t>
            <t>Multiplexing scalable layers,</t>
          </list>
        in RTP transmission there is no need for the last two
        features. Therefore, these two features MUST NOT be used in
        applications based on RTP packetization specified by this document.
        Since LATM has been developed for only natural audio coding tools,
        i.e., not for synthesis tools, it seems difficult to transmit
        Structured Audio (SA) data and Text to Speech Interface (TTSI) data by
        LATM. Therefore, SA data and TTSI data MUST NOT be transported by the
        RTP packetization in this document.</t>

        <t>For transmission of scalable streams, audio data of each layer
        SHOULD be packetized onto different RTP streams allowing for the
        different layers to be treated differently at the IP level, for
        example via some means of differentiated service. On the other hand,
        all configuration data of the scalable streams are contained in one
        LATM configuration data "StreamMuxConfig" and every scalable layer
        shares the StreamMuxConfig. The mapping between each layer and its
        configuration data is achieved by LATM header information attached to
        the audio data. In order to indicate the dependency information of the
        scalable streams, the signaling mechanism as specified in
        <xref target="RFC5583" /> SHOULD be used (see section 4.2).</t>

        <t>For MPEG-4 Audio coding tools, as is true for other audio coders,
        if the payload is a single audio frame, packet loss will not impair
        the decodability of adjacent packets. Therefore, the additional media
        specific header for recovering errors will not be required for MPEG-4
        Audio. Existing RTP protection mechanisms, such as Generic Forward
        Error Correction (<xref target="RFC5109"> RFC 5109
        </xref>) and Redundant Audio Data (<xref target="RFC2198"> RFC 2198
        </xref>), MAY be applied to improve error resiliency.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Differences to RFC 3016" toc="default">
        <t>The RTP payload format for MPEG-4 Audio as specified in RFC 3016 is used by the
        <xref target="3GPP" >3GPP PSS service</xref>. However,
        there are some misalignments between RFC 3016 and the 3GPP PSS
        specification that are addressed by this update:
        <list hangIndent="0" style="symbols">
          <t>The audio payload format (LATM) referenced in RFC 3016 is binary
          incompatible to the format used in 3GPP.</t>

          <t>The audio signaling format (StreamMuxConfig) referenced in RFC
          3016 is binary incompatible to the format used in 3GPP.</t>

          <t>The audio parameter "SBR-enabled" is not defined within RFC 3016
          but used by 3GPP</t>

          <t>The rate parameter specification is ambiguous in the presence of
          SBR (Spectral Band Replication)</t>

          <t>The number of audio channel parameter specification is ambiguous
          in the presence of PS (Parametric Stereo) </t>
        </list>
        Furthermore some comments have been addressed and signaling
        support for MPEG surround <xref target="23003-1" /> was added. It should
        be noted that the audio payload format described here has some known
        limitations. For new system designs <xref target="RFC3640"> RFC 3640
        </xref> is recommended.</t>

             toc="default">
      <t>This section specifies RTP packetization rules for MPEG-4 Visual
      content. An MPEG-4 Visual bitstream is mapped directly onto RTP packets
      without the addition of extra header fields or any removal of Visual
      syntax elements. The Combined Configuration/Elementary stream mode MUST
      be used so that configuration information will be carried to the same
      RTP port as the elementary stream. (see 6.2.1 "Start codes" of ISO/IEC
      14496-2 <xref target="14496-2" /> <xref target="14496-2/Cor.1" /> <xref
      target="14496-2/Amd.1" />) The configuration information MAY
      additionally be specified by some out-of-band means. If needed for an
      H.323 terminal, H.245 codepoint "decoderConfigurationInformation" MUST
      be used for this purpose. If needed by systems using Media Type parameters
      and SDP parameters, e.g., SIP and RTSP, the optional parameter "config"
      MUST be used to specify the configuration information (see 5.1 and
      5.2).</t>

      <t>When the short video header mode is used, the RTP payload format for
      H.263 SHOULD be used (the format defined in <xref target="RFC4629">
      RFC 4629 </xref> is RECOMMENDED, but the <xref target="RFC4628">
      RFC 4628 </xref> format MAY be used for compatibility with
      older implementations).</t>

        <t>Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this
        packet format is outside the scope of this document, and will not
        be specified here. It is expected that the RTP profile for a
        particular class of applications will assign a payload type for this
        encoding, or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic
        range SHALL be chosen by means of an out-of-band signaling protocol
        (e.g., H.245, SIP, etc).</t>

        <t>Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used.</t>

        <t>Sequence Number: Incremented by one for each RTP data packet sent,
        starting, for security reasons, with a random initial value.</t>

        <t>Marker (M) bit: The marker bit is set to one to indicate the last
        RTP packet (or only RTP packet) of a VOP. When multiple VOPs are
        carried in the same RTP packet, the marker bit is set to one.</t>

        <t>Timestamp: The timestamp indicates the sampling instance of the VOP
        contained in the RTP packet. A constant offset, which is random, is
        added for security reasons.

            the VOPs are derived from the timestamp fields in the VOP header
            (modulo_time_base and vop_time_increment).</t>

            <t>If the RTP packet contains only configuration information

        <t>A fragmented MPEG-4 Visual bitstream is mapped directly onto the
        RTP payload without any addition of extra header fields or any removal
        of Visual syntax elements. The Combined Configuration/Elementary

        <t>In the following, header means one of the following: <list

            video_plane_with_short_header(), MeshObject() or FaceObject())</t>

            <t>The video packet header (video_packet_header() excluding
            next_resync_marker())</t>

            <t>The header of gob_layer()</t>

            <t>See 6.2.1 "Start codes" of ISO/IEC 14496-2 <xref

            target="14496-2/Amd.1" /> for the definition of the configuration
            information and the entry point functions.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>(1) Configuration information and Group_of_VideoObjectPlane()
        fields SHALL be placed at the beginning of the RTP payload (just after
        the RTP header) or just after the header of the syntactically upper
        layer function.</t>

        <t>(2) If one or more headers exist in the RTP payload, the RTP
        payload SHALL begin with the header of the syntactically highest
        function. Note: The visual_object_sequence_end_code is regarded as the
        lowest function.</t>

        <t>(3) A header SHALL NOT be split into a plurality of RTP
        packets.</t>

        <t>(4) Different VOPs SHOULD be fragmented into different RTP packets
        so that one RTP packet consists of the data bytes associated with a
        unique VOP time instance (that is indicated in the timestamp field in
        the RTP packet header), with the exception that multiple consecutive
        VOPs MAY be carried within one RTP packet in the decoding order if the
        size of the VOPs is small.</t>

        <t>Note: When multiple VOPs are carried in one RTP payload, the
        timestamp of the VOPs after the first one may be calculated by the
        decoder. This operation is necessary only for RTP packets in which the
        marker bit equals to one and the beginning of RTP payload corresponds
        to a start code. (See timestamp and marker bit in section 3.1.)</t>

        <t>(5) It is RECOMMENDED that a single video packet is sent as a
        single RTP packet. The size of a video packet SHOULD be adjusted in
        such a way that the resulting RTP packet is not larger than the
        path-MTU. Note: Rule (5) does not apply when the video packet is
        disabled by the coder configuration (by setting resync_marker_disable
        in the VOL header to 1), or in coding tools where the video packet is
        not supported. In this case, a VOP MAY be split at arbitrary
        byte-positions.</t>

        <t>The video packet starts with the VOP header or the video packet
        header, followed by motion_shape_texture(), and ends with
        next_resync_marker() or next_start_code().</t>

      <section title="Examples of packetized MPEG-4 Visual bitstream"
               toc="default">
        <t>Figure 2 shows examples of RTP packets generated based on the
        criteria described in 3.2</t>

        <t>(a) is an example of the first RTP packet or the random access
        point of an MPEG-4 Visual bitstream containing the configuration
        information. According to criterion (1), the Visual Object Sequence
        Header(VS header) is placed at the beginning of the RTP payload,
        preceding the Visual Object Header and the Video Object Layer
        Header(VO header, VOL header). Since the fragmentation rule defined in
        3.2 guarantees that the configuration information, starting with
        visual_object_sequence_start_code, is always placed at the beginning
        of the RTP payload, RTP receivers can detect the random access point
        by checking if the first 32-bit field of the RTP payload is
        visual_object_sequence_start_code.</t>

        <t>(b) is another example of the RTP packet containing the
        configuration information. It differs from example (a) in that the RTP
        packet also contains a video packet in the VOP following the
        configuration information. Since the length of the configuration
        information is relatively short (typically scores of bytes) and an RTP
        packet containing only the configuration information may thus increase
        the overhead, the configuration information and the immediately
        following GOV and/or (a part of) VOP can be packetized into a single
        RTP packet as in this example.</t>

        <t>(c) is an example of an RTP packet that contains
        Group_of_VideoObjectPlane(GOV). Following criterion (1), the GOV is
        placed at the beginning of the RTP payload. It would be a waste of
        RTP/IP header overhead to generate an RTP packet containing only a GOV
        whose length is 7 bytes. Therefore, (a part of) the following VOP can
        be placed in the same RTP packet as shown in (c).</t>

        <t>(d) is an example of the case where one video packet is packetized
        into one RTP packet. When the packet-loss rate of the underlying
        network is high, this kind of packetization is recommended. Even when
        the RTP packet containing the VOP header is discarded by a packet
        loss, the other RTP packets can be decoded by using the HEC(Header
        Extension Code) information in the video packet header. No extra RTP
        header field is necessary.</t>

        <t>(e) is an example of the case where more than one video packet is
        packetized into one RTP packet. This kind of packetization is
        effective to save the overhead of RTP/IP headers when the bit-rate of
        the underlying network is low. However, it will decrease the
        packet-loss resiliency because multiple video packets are discarded by
        a single RTP packet loss. The optimal number of video packets in an
        RTP packet and the length of the RTP packet can be determined
        considering the packet-loss rate and the bit-rate of the underlying
        network.</t>

        <t>(f) is an example of the case when the video packet is disabled by
        setting resync_marker_disable in the VOL header to 1. In this case, a
        VOP may be split into a plurality of RTP packets at arbitrary
        byte-positions. For example, it is possible to split a VOP into
        fixed-length packets. This kind of coder configuration and RTP packet
        fragmentation may be used when the underlying network is guaranteed to
        be error-free. On the other hand, it is not recommended to use it in
        error-prone environment since it provides only poor packet loss
        resiliency.</t>

        <t>Figure 3 shows examples of RTP packets prohibited by the criteria
        of 3.2.</t>

        <t>Fragmentation of a header into multiple RTP packets, as in (a),
        will not only increase the overhead of RTP/IP headers but also
        decrease the error resiliency. Therefore, it is prohibited by the
        criterion (3).</t>

        <t>When concatenating more than one video packets into an RTP packet,
        VOP header or video_packet_header() shall not be placed in the middle
        of the RTP payload. The packetization as in (b) is not allowed by
        criterion (2) due to the aspect of the error resiliency. Comparing
        this example with Figure 2(d), although two video packets are mapped
        onto two RTP packets in both cases, the packet-loss resiliency is not
        identical. Namely, if the second RTP packet is lost, both video
        packets 1 and 2 are lost in the case of Figure 3(b) whereas only video
        packet 2 is lost in the case of Figure 2(d).</t>

        <t>In order to decode the audioMuxElement, the following
        muxConfigPresent information is required to be indicated by
        out-of-band means. When SDP is utilized for this indication, the Media Type
        parameter "cpresent" corresponds to the muxConfigPresent information
        (see section 5.3). The following restrictions apply: <list
            hangIndent="1" style="symbols">
            <t>In the out-of-band configuration case the number of PayloadMux
            elements contained in each audioMuxElement can only be set once.
            If values greater than one PayloadMux Element are used, special
            care is required to ensure that the last RTP packet remains
            decodable.</t>

            <t>In the in-band configuration case the audio frames are in general
            not byte aligned. Hinting RTP payload from MP4 file format <xref
            target="14496-12" /> <xref target="14496-14" /> is therefore not
            possible.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>muxConfigPresent: If this value is set to 1 (in-band mode), the
        audioMuxElement SHALL include an indication bit "useSameStreamMux" and
        MAY include the configuration information for audio compression
        "StreamMuxConfig". The useSameStreamMux bit indicates whether the
        StreamMuxConfig element in the previous frame is applied in the
        current frame. If the useSameStreamMux bit indicates to use the
        StreamMuxConfig from the previous frame, but if the previous frame has
        been lost, the current frame may not be decodable. Therefore, in case
        of in-band mode, the StreamMuxConfig element SHOULD be transmitted

        be specified here. It is expected that the RTP profile for a
        particular class of applications will assign a payload type for this
        encoding, or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic
        range shall be chosen by means of an out-of-band signaling protocol
        (e.g., H.245, SIP, etc). In the dynamic assignment of RTP payload
        types for scalable streams, a different value SHOULD be assigned to
        each layer. The dependency relationships between the enhance layer
        and the base layer SHOULD be signaled as specified in

        <t>In this example, the presence of SBR can not be determined
        by the SDP parameter set. The clock rate represents the core
        codec sampling rate. An SBR enabled decoder SHOULD use the SBR tool to
        upsample the audio data if complexity and resulting output sampling rate permits.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Example: Use of the SBR-enabled parameter" toc="default">
        <t>These two examples are identical to the example above with the
        exception of the SBR-enabled parameter.
        The presence of SBR is not signaled by the SDP parameters object,
        profile-level-id and config, but instead the SBR-enabled parameter
        is present. The rate parameter and the StreamMuxConfig contain the
        core codec sampling rate.</t>

        <t>Example with "SBR-enabled=0", definitive and core codec sampling rate 24kHz:
          <figure>
            <artwork>
  m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
  a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/24000/2

            </artwork>
          </figure>
        </t>

        <t>Example with "SBR-enabled=1", core codec sampling rate 24kHz, definitive and SBR sampling rate 48kHz:
          <figure>
            <artwork>
  m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96

            </artwork>
          </figure>
        </t>

        <t> In this example, the clock rate is still 24000 and
        this information should be used for RTP timestamp calculation. The
        value of 24000 is used to support old AAC decoders. This makes the
        decoder supporting only AAC understand the HE AAC coded data, although only
        plain AAC is supported.
        A HE AAC decoder is able to generate ourput data with the SBR sampling rate.</t>

        <section title="Example: Hierarchical Signaling of SBR" toc="default">

        <t>When the presence of SBR is explicitly signaled by the SDP
        parameters object, profile-level-id or the config string as in the
        example below, the StreamMuxConfig contains both the core codec
        sampling rate and the SBR sampling rate.

            </artwork>
          </figure>
        </t>

        <t>This config string uses the explicit signaling mode 2.A
        (hierarchical signaling; See <xref target="14496-3">ISO/IEC 14496-3
        </xref>). This means that the AOT(Audio Object Type) is SBR(5) and
        SFI(Sampling Frequency Index) is 6(24000 Hz) which refers to the
        underlying core codec sampling frequency. CC(Channel Configuration)
        is stereo(2), and the ESFI(Extension Sampling Frequency Index)=3
        (48000) is referring to the sampling frequency of the extension
        tool(SBR).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Example: HE AAC v2 Signaling" toc="default">
        <t>HE AAC v2 decoders are required to always produce a stereo
                signal from a mono signal. Hence, there is no parameter necessary to signal
                the presence of PS.</t>
        <t>Example with "SBR-enabled=1" and 1 channel signaled in the a=rtpmap line and within the config parameter.
                Core codec sampling rate is 24kHz, definitive and SBR sampling rate is 48kHz.
               Core codec channel configuration is mono, PS channel configuration is stereo.

        <t>The config parameter indicates explicit hierarchical signaling of

        <section title="Example: MPEG Surround" toc="default">
        <t>The following examples show how MPEG Surround configuration data
        can be signaled using SDP. The configuration is carried within the
        config string in the first example by using two different layers. The
        general parameters in this example are: AudioMuxVersion=1;
        allStreamsSameTimeFraming=1; numSubFrames=0; numProgram=0; numLayer=1.
        The first layer describes the HE AAC payload and signals the following
        parameters: ascLen=25; audioObjectType=2 (AAC LC);
        extensionAudioObjectType=5 (SBR); samplingFrequencyIndex=6 (24kHz);
        extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex=3 (48kHz); channelConfiguration=2 (2.0
        channels). The second layer describes the MPEG surround payload and
        specifies the following parameters: ascLen=110; AudioObjectType=30
        (MPEG Surround); samplingFrequencyIndex=3 (48kHz);
        channelConfiguration=6 (5.1 channels); sacPayloadEmbedding=1;
        SpatialSpecificConfig=(48 kHz; 32 slots; 525 tree; ResCoding=1;
        ResBands=[7,7,7,7]).</t>

        <t>In this example the signaling is carried by using two different
        LATM layers. The MPEG surround payload is carried together with the
        AAC payload in a single layer as indicated by the sacPayloadEmbedding
        Flag.

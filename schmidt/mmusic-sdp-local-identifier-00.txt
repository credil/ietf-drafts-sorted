Abstract

   Dynamic Policy Controllers like resource and admission control
   systems need to be able to locate media receivers in each segment of
   the network to determine the path of the media flows prior to
   allowing or rejecting the session setup.  Current definitions of SDP
   are not clear about conveying a local identifier (e.g. private IP
   address) of the client that is destined to receive media streams
   after successful SDP negotiation.  In this draft we explain the need
   for carrying such information over SDP and discuss a set of possible
   solutions.

1.  Introduction

   To perform resource and admission control inside home networks
   consisting of multiple home network devices (HNDs), the local
   admission controller which is usually incorporated inside the home
   gateway (HGW) must be made aware of which device in the home network
   requested multimedia session setup.  Simply assuming that the source
   address of the signaling message will be the destination address for
   the media stream delivery is not sufficient since signaling and media
   rendering can take place on different HNDs.  The HGW can either
   receive such information from snooping signaling using application
   layer gateways (ALGs) or it can learn it from a network-centric
   resource and admission control subsystem like ETSI TISPAN RACS
   [ETSI-RACS] or ITU-T RACF [ITU-T-RACF].  However, in case a HND uses
   encrypted signaling towards the operator network entities via e.g.
   IPSec as in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) case, an ALG-based
   approach relying on traffic snooping would fail: the HGW is unable to
   examine the signaling of the HND.  In this case it becomes necessary
   that the HGW receives the HND identifier from the operator network
   side as depicted in the following figure:

   A HND (HND1 in above figure) uses SIP as signaling protocol with the
   SIP server or proxy over an encrypted signaling link via network
   connectivity denoted 'a' inside the Home Network and an Operator
   Network link 'A'.  The signaling content is tunneled through the HGW
   (indicated by the virtual direct link 'T') and since it is encrypted,
   the HGW cannot examine/interpret the signaling - and is therefore not
   knowledgeable of the session setup request from HND1 and the
   associated session description.  Based on the Session Description
   carried in SDP, the SIP infrastructure triggers the resource
   controller (RC) over link 'B' to reserve resources for the requested
   session.  At current state of the art, policy control systems such as
   e.g.  ETSI TISPAN RACS or ITU-T RACF reserve resources in the Access
   and Core Network, i.e. towards the Home Networks, but not inside
   those.  To enable resource reservations also inside the home network
   either the HGW or the RC need to be aware of the home network
   resources and be able to perform admission control on session
   requests.  For either case a link 'C' towards the Home Network is
   needed.

   Considering Home Network topology and resource status information to
   be a matter of privacy, the HGW becomes the admission control entity
   of choice for local resource control.  Hence, the RC needs to pass
   the resource request to the HGW providing in this request also the
   HND identifier mentioned above.  This enables the HGW to find the
   destination for the media stream (HND1 in above figure, the same HND
   that originated the signaling).  Thus, there is a need to loop a
   local identifier from the source of the signaling (HND1) through the
   SIP/SDP infrastructure and the RC back to the HGW.

   Further to performing admission control for QoS purposes inside the
   Home Network, it also becomes possible to block IGMP/MLD join
   messages from HNDs that are not supposed to receive the stream.

   The HND identifier itself may be restricted to being only of local
   significance in case it is e.g., issued by the HGW.  Examples are
   private IP addresses inside the Home Network or specifically issued
   identifiers by the HGW.

2.  Possible Solutions

   Concerning state of the art SDP as defined in RFC 4566 [SDP-RFC], the
   related information could be carried in

   1.  The c-line which indicates where the HND would like to receive
       media.  However, in case of multicast services such as Linear
       IPTV (also referred to as Broadcast IPTV in ETSI TISPAN), the
       c-line carries a multicast address and is not suitable to
       identify the requesting HND.  Moreover, even in the case of
       unicast sessions this line might not be reliable since it can be
       impacted by NAT traversal steps re-writing this line.

   2.  The o-line which indicates the origin of the session.  This could
       carry a CPN-local identifier in principle, however this would
       violate the SDP RFC 4566 [SDP-RFC] which forbids to carry a local
       identifier in the o-line to a domain where it has no
       significance.  In addition, Operator Network entities are
       unlikely to process this parameter for resource reservation
       purposes.

   3.  The s-line which carries the session name.  In principle it could
       be used to carry the HND identifier requesting the session,
       however Operator Network entities are unlikely to process this
       parameter for resource reservation purposes.

   4.  The i-line which can carry any kind of information on the session
       or media.  While usage of this parameter is possible in
       principle, current Operator Network entities such as the P-CSCF
       of IMS are not likely to process the i-line for the purpose of
       requesting resources.

   5.  The a-line on session or on media level.  This line is examined
       by the Operator side entities for resource reservation purposes
       at present.  A new parameter like 'HND-id' would need to be
       registered.

   6.  A new line in SDP.  This would require extending the SDP standard
       or defining a new standard for this line and its semantics.

   It appears beneficial to allow the parameter to be carried on either
   session or media level, as the carriage on session level can indicate
   a scenario where all media lines requested are associated to the same
   HND which might or might not be identical with the signaling HND
   setting up the session.  Defining it on media line level would allow
   to associate individual media lines to individual different HNDs,
   e.g. in case of IPTV services, there could be different media
   rendering devices indicated for video and audio (e.g.  TV screen and

   HIFI stereo).  This is another indicator against using the o-line or
   the s-line which are only carried on session level.

   Taking this into account and looking at these six options, options 5
   and 6 appear to be the most suitable solutions.  Taking into account
   e.g. current ETSI TISPAN NGN standards where the content of the
   a-line is to be sent to the RACS over the so-called Gq' interface
   using the codec-data AVP (cf. 3GPP TS 29.214, section 5.3.7), it
   appears that option 5 is preferable.

   A question remains on the information to be carried in the HND
   identifier parameter.  At present, HND IP-address seems suitable, but
   in principle, also any other parameter could be used as long as the
   HGW is able to resolve it.  Thus, it is proposed to allow an IP
   address or a generic octet string in this parameter.

   The following examples base on IMS based IP TV as defined in
   [ETSI-IPTV] and show the use of an additional a-line for transporting
   the local identifier named "LID" (here: IP address, optionally with
   port).  Note that they include the HND IP address also in the o-line
   which is currently not RFC-compliant.

3.  Unicast Use Case

   In the following example SDP based on ETSI TISPAN IMS based IPTV
   [ETSI-IPTV] is sent from a HND during session initiation (carried in
   a SIP INVITE request towards the Operator Network) in case of content
   on demand (CoD), i.e. requesting unicast traffic.  Due to the
   considerations described above, the local address of the media-
   receiving HND carried in the SDP cannot be used for resource
   admission control inside the Home Network.

   a=recvonly
   b=AS:15000
   c=IN IP4 192.168.0.1

   In the subsequent example SDP, the HND identifier in form of a local
   IP address is carried on the session level through the parameter
   a=LID:192.168.0.1.  Through this, assuming a network setup as
   described above and using encrypted signaling between HND and the SIP
   Proxy, the HGW can (through receiving it from the RC) identify the
   device destined for the media session which includes an RTSP link as
   well as a high bandwidth video stream.  The HGW then can act as a
   resource controlling entity, e.g. by prioritizing traffic or by
   replying negatively to the RC in case e.g. in-home links are not
   capable of handling the requested media.

4.  Multicast Use Case

   The subsequent SDP example shows the SDP data send by the HND based
   on [ETSI-IPTV] for "Broadcast IPTV" using IP multicast for media
   distribution:

   v=0
   o=jdoe 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127
   s=Multicast session
   t=2873397496 2873404696
   m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 33
   c=IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127
   a=bc_service:BCServiceIdtoJoin
   a=recvonly

   In this example SDP it is apparent that the HGW cannot identify the
   requesting HND when contacted by the RC upon session initiation
   because the SDP carries the IP address of the multicast group it
   intends to join (corresponding to the bc_service parameter, both
   received e.g. through an Electronic Program Guide) which translates
   into one Broadcast IPTV channel.

   The subsequent example SDP additionally carries the HND identifier
   ('HND1') as a string on media line level to enable the HGW to
   identify the destined HND inside the Home Network.  Note that the HND
   identifier could also be carried on session level as described in the
   unicast SDP example above.  Note also that instead of carrying a
   string ('HND1'), also a local ip address could be used - as long as
   it is suitable for identifying the destined HND unambiguously inside
   the Home Network.

   v=0
   o=jdoe 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127
   s=Multicast session
   t=2873397496 2873404696
   m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 33
   c=IN IP4 224.2.17.12/127
   a=bc_service:BCServiceIdtoJoin
   a=recvonly
   a=LID:HND1


   Above example shows that in a private network even two different HNDs
   requesting the same multicast traffic become distinguishable by the
   HGW through the use of a local HND identifier parameter.  Note that
   through this, as mentioned above, also a rejection or blocking of
   IGMP/MLD join messages of HNDs that are not supposed to receive the
   multicast media stream becomes possible inside the Home Network.

6.  Conclusion

   We have outlined the need to convey a local identifier of Home
   Network Devices through a domain where it has no significance back to
   the Home Network for resource and admission control purposes.  In
   these considerations the focus lay on carrying this identifier in
   SDP.  To define the means to carry the identifier discussions and
   reflections are sought on the different considerations presented
   above.

   This memo is work in progress and is requesting feedback from the
   MMUSIC working group.

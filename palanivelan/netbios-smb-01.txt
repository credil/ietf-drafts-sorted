Abstract

	The Network Basic I/O System (NetBIOS) NetBIOS was developed in
        the early 1980s to allow applications to communicate over a
        network. The TCP/IP version called NetBIOSoverTCP/IP(NetBT),
        was developed to support communications between symbolically 
        named stations and transfer of arbitrary data.NetBT supports all
        three services (Name, Datagram and Session) supported by NetBIOS.
        
	The Server Message Block (SMB) is a presentation layer protocol
        providing file and print sharing functions for LAN Manager, and
        other network operating systems. 

	SMB over NetBT session is not clearly explained in the RFCs 
        [Netbios concepts] and [Netbios specification] and this document
        attempts to provide information on this.

1. Requirements notation


   	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   	"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   	this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2. Introduction

	NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT, or sometimes NetBT) is a networking protocol 
        that allows legacy computer applications relying on the NetBIOS API to
        scale for the modern TCP/IP networks.This shall support all the three
        NetBIOS services (given below) over secured tcp/ip connections. 
        
        * Name service for name registration and resolution (port: 137)
        * Datagram distribution service for connectionless 
          communication (port: 138)
        * Session service for connection-oriented communication (port: 139)

	The file and printer sharing services are provided by the Server Message
        Block (SMB) protocol. This shall run on top of NetBT session or run 
        directly over TCP.


3. Overview

       In NetBIOS, The following three serivces are supported.
       
       Name Service    :  Each participant must register on the network using a 
                          unique name of at most 16 characters. NetBT Name 
                          Service handles and records all name registrations.

       Datagram Service:  Datagram mode is connectionless. A datagram is sent 
                          to unique or multiple NetBIOS pariticipants on the
                          network.

       Session Service :  Session mode lets two computers in the network to 
                          access and trasfer data in a secured way.NetBT allows
                          larger messages to be handled, and provides error 
                          detection and recovery.
 
       The following TCP Ports are used for the Netbios Services:

	   	Name  service         137/UDP  or  137/TCP
   		Datagram service      138/UDP
   		Session service       139/TCP
                 
       Direct hosted "NetBIOS-less" SMB traffic uses port 445 (TCP and UDP) 
       and SMB over NetBT uses the nbsession service Port (139/TCP).
	
       This document focusses on the NetBT Session service in particular and
       hence shall discuss SMB and SMB over NetBT.

4. Server Message Block packet structure


	SMB allows computers to control sessions like share files, printers, 
        disks etc. and has the following packet structure.


                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

A successful connection from a client machine to the server returns a Treeid
that identifies the transactions through this particular connection. Each of
the operations from the client is identified by the caller process id (PID)
and the userid (UID) is used for the authenticated requests/operations.

Multiplexing the single client and server connection among the client's 
multiple processes, threads, and requests per thread is identified by the 
Multiplex id (MID).

The Size of the data portion of the packet is given by Bytecount and the actual
data follows this field.

5. Netbios Session Service Packet structure

   The [Netbios specification] describes the session service packet structure.
   File and printer services are the primary uses of the NetBIOS Session 
   service.
	
   All session packets are of the following general structure:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |      TYPE     |     FLAGS     |            LENGTH             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   /               TRAILER (Packet Type Dependent)                 /
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The TYPE, FLAGS, and LENGTH fields are present in every session
   packet

         TYPE - Message Type (SESSION MESSAGE
                              SESSION REQUEST
           		      POSITIVE SESSION RESPONSE
                              NEGATIVE SESSION RESPONSE
                              RETARGET SESSION RESPONSE
                              SESSION KEEP ALIVE)

   5.1  Session Message
 
   The actual data transfer in NetBT session is through session messages. 
   The Session service Packet Type "Session message" is represented
   in hexadecimal as 00.

           00 -  SESSION MESSAGE

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

   |                                                               |

   The NetBT session is established on TCP port 139 and the data transfer 
   is done through the session messages.The connection is then closed after
   the data transfer.  There may be one or more session messages during an
   active session based on the size of data.

6. File and Printer Sharing Operations 
	
       	The file and printer sharing services are provided by the Server Message
        Block (SMB) protocol. This shall run on top of NetBT session or run 
        directly over TCP. SMB fits well with the client-server topology, where 
        client makes specific requests and the server responds accordingly.


        6.1 Direct hosted SMB
		
	Direct hosted SMB traffic uses port 445. This does not use NetBT. Here,
        a four-byte header precedes the SMB traffic. The first byte of this
        header is always 0x00, and the next three bytes are the length of the
        data.
       
        This is useful in systems that do not support NetBT and in networks 
        where NetBT is not preferred. 
         
        If the Client has NetBT disabled, it will always try to connect to the 
        server at port 445 only. If the server answers on port 445, the session
        shall be established and continued on that port. If it doesn't answer, 
        the session will fail completely.When the server has NetBT disabled, it
        shall listen on port 445 only and respond to requests to this port.


        6.2 SMB over NetBT
	
        If both the direct hosted and NetBT interfaces are enabled, both 
        methods are tried at the same time and the first to respond is used.
        This allows interoparability with operating systems that do not support 
        direct hosting of SMB traffic or NetBT. 
	
	6.2.1.  NetBT Session Establishment

	When the client and the remote machine have NetBT enabled, the Netbios	
	Sessions are established by exchanging packets on TCP port 139. The 
        computer establishing the session attempts to make a TCP connection to
        port 139 on the remote computer/server.
                
        On establishing the TCP connection, the client then sends over this 
        connection a "Session Request" packet with the NetBIOS names of the 
        client to the NetBIOS name to remote machine/server.The remote computer
        shall respond with a "Positive Session Response" indicating that a 
        session can be established or a "Negative Session Response" indicating
        that no session can be established.
	
	Multiple sessions each identified with a unique Transactionid, may exist
        between any pair of calling and called names.

	6.2.2 NetBT session Data Transfer

	Data is transmitted during an established session by Session Message 
        packets.NetBIOS keep-alives are used on each connection to verify that
        both the server and workstation are still able to maintain their 
        session.For file sharing or printer sharing services, the data transfer 
        shall be through the SMB packets that are exchanged as NetBT session 
        message packets.

	6.2.3 SMB Data transfer on NetBT

	On an established NetBT session,the client through SMB negotiates the
        SMB capabilities with the remote machine/server.This is done through 
        SMB command "Negotiate protocol request" on NetBT session message 
        which is responded by a "Negotiate protocol response".
	The negotiated SMB capabilities includes understanding long file names,
        extended attributes, and so on.

        All the SMB command messages go on top of the NetBT session message on
        port139.The flags field in the SMB header shall indicate the type of 
        SMB command as request to the server or as response to the client or 
        the redirector.

        SMB shall follow this with "Session setup and x request" command.
        The User and domain information of the connecting machine shall be 
        recorded in the local system.The session setup request shall have the 
        same process id (PID) as the Negotiate protocol request/response.
        This command is replied with a "session setup and x response" command
        for the same PID.

        SMB "Tree connect and X request" command shall follow the session setup.
        The "Path" field of this command shall contain the path of the shared 
        resource in the remote machine/server, the client is requesting access.
        The remote machine shall respond with a "Tree connect and X response"
        for a sucessful tree connection with a unique TreeID.

        On establishing the tree connection, further network traffic shall be 
        generated based on the opertation performed including displaying 
        directory, accessing data files, lanuching applications, etc. The 
        subsequent transactions on this tree connection shall have matching 
        TID,PID,UID information.

        The SMB data transfer typically uses "Read and x request", "Read and x
        response", "Write and x request" and "Write and x response" commands.
        "No more data from sender" flag set in these commands shall indiacate
        that there is no more data to follow.

        The client machine sends a "close request"  command and the server shall
        acknowledge with a "close response". This may be followed by a further 
        set of transactions on the same tree.
                
        The client may then request to close the tree connection with a "tree 
        disconnect request".The remote machine/server releases the TID and 
        responds with a "tree disconnect response".

	6.2.4 NetBT Session Close
	
        The NetBT Sessions are closed by closing the TCP connection.When a user
        requests to close a session, the service first attempts a graceful 
        close of the TCP connection.  If the connection does not close within 
        the SSN_CLOSE_TIMEOUT the TCP connection is aborted. No matter how the
        TCP connection is terminated, the NetBIOS session service always closes
        the NetBIOS session.

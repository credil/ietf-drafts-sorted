1. Introduction 

   MPLS-TP is technology of packet transport network, which requirement 
   is defined in MPLS-TP requirement [2], and OAM is its most important 
   function. MPLS-TP OAM requirement [3] define diagnostic tools that 
   MAY be used for PW, LSP and Section, such as consists in looping the 
   traffic at an Intermediate Point or End point back to the originating

   End Point-loopback.  And another example of such diagnostic tool-test 
   (TST) consists in estimating the bandwidth or throughput of transport 
   path e.g., an LSP. 

   This document defines one diagnostic tool-TST (test) for bandwidth 
   estimating, measuring or verifying. And it describes TST OAM frame 
   format and the procedures for the transmission, receive of such OAM 
   frames. 

   The TST function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs 
   and Sections.

3. Mechanics of TST 

3.1. General Requirements 

   TST is used to perform one-way or two way on-demand in-service or 
   out-of-service diagnostics tests. This includes verifying throughput, 
   which is a capacity in terms of line rate; it is the amount of bits 
   observed passing a point during a time interval. 

   When configured to perform such tests, a MEP inserts packets with 
   MPLS-TP test information with specified throughput, packet size and 
   transmission patterns. For one way test, remote MEP receives the 
   packet and calculates the packet loss. For two way test, the remote 
   MEP loopback the packet to original MEP and calculates the packet 
   loss. 

   When out-of-service MPLS-TP test function is performed, client data 
   traffic is disrupted in the diagnosed entity by LCK function. The MEP 
   configured for the out-of-service test transmits LCK packets in the 
   immediate client (sub-) layer.  And gradually increase TST packet 
   bandwidth until hitting a threshold TST packet traffic loss rate. 

   When an in-service MPLS-TP test function is performed, data traffic 
   is not disrupted and the packets with MPLS-TP test information are 
   transmitted such that a limited part of the service bandwidth is 
   utilized. This rate and QoS of transmission for TST packets is pre-
   determined for in-service MPLS-TP test function. 

   The maximum rate at which TST packets can be sent without adversely 
   impacting the data traffic for an in-service is should be calculated 
   carefully. 

   Observe TST packet that are transmitted, delivered, and or rejected 
   on a PW, LSP or Section. When detect threshold of packet loss rate, 
   calculated the throughput. 

   In order to support TST, a Test TLV in TST PDU should be defined: 

   Test TLV - Optional element whose length and contents are 
   configurable at the MEP. The contents can be a test pattern and an 
   optional checksum. Examples of test patterns include pseudo-random 
   bit sequence (PRBS) (231-1) as specified in sub-clause 5.8 of ITU-T 
   O.150 [4], all '0' pattern, etc.  

   At the transmitting MEP, provisioning is required for a test signal 
   generator which is associated with the MEP. At a receiving MEP,

Internet-Draft    Diagnostic tool-test for MPLS-TP    October 21, 2009 
    

   provisioning is required for a test signal detector which is 
   associated with the MEP.  

   A MIP is transparent to the TST packets and therefore does not 
   require any provisioning to support MPLS-TP test functionality. 

   A MEP inserts TST packets towards its peer MEPs. The receiving MEP 
   detects these TST packets and performs the intended measurements. 

3.2. Transmission 

   A test signal generator connected to a MEP can transmit TST packets 
   as often as the test signal generator configuration. Each TST packet 
   is transmitted with a specific Sequence Number. A different Sequence 
   Number must be used for every TST packet, and no Sequence Number from 
   the same MEP may be repeated within one minute. 

   When a MEP is configured for an out-of-service test, the MEP also 
   generates LCK packets in the same direction where TST packets are 
   transmitted.  And TST packet transmission rate should be increased 
   gradually by step of x Kb/s and recorded TST packet transmitted, 
   delivered or rejected. 

   When a MEP is configured for an in-service test, the MEP not 
   generates any LCK packet. And TST packet transmission rate should be 
   increased gradually by step of x Kb/s, but it is less than Maximum 
   bit rate. In order to verify the throughput, QoS of test packet 
   should be considered, color, CIR/EIR should be carefully calculated 
   in order not to impact the service. 

   And service packet that is transmitted MUST be also recorded by 
   traffic condition performance counter. 

    

3.3. Receive 

   If the receiving MEP is configured for MPLS-TP test function, the 
   test signal detector connected to the MEP detects bit errors or 
   packet loss rate from e.g. the pseudo-random bit sequence of the 
   received TST packets and reports such errors.  

   Further, when the receiving MEP is configured for an out-of-service 
   test, it also generates LCK packets a in the direction where the TST 
   packets are received. Detected the packet loss rates or bit errors of 
   test packet, and record the rate of test packet transmission or 
   rejected.

   When the receiving MEP is configured for an in service test, no any 
   LCK packet is generated. At same time, record all service packet 
   counters of transmitted, delivered, and or rejected.

   Mechanisms SHOULD be provided to ensure that unauthorized access is 
   prevented from triggering any TST function. 

   This will prevent unauthorized access to vital equipment and it will 
   prevent third parties from learning about sensitive information about 
   the transport network. 

   TST messages MAY be authenticated.

   There is one channel type for TST by IANA actions required by this

Internet-Draft       LMP extension for optical PnP           July 2010


Abstract

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane 
   (c-plane) is expected to reduce operational expenditure (OPEX). 
   Currently we need to, however, manually configure interface 
   addresses of links before we advertise the link-state using a 
   GMPLS routing protocol for an automatic topology discovery 
   mechanism. Especially in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) 
   networks, there are a number of optical fibers between neighbor 
   nodes, each of which again carries a bunch of wavelength links. It 
   is a tedious task to configure interface addresses of wavelength 
   links between neighbor nodes.

   In order to suppress the tasks of configuring addresses of 
   wavelength links between neighbor nodes, an optical plug and play 
   (PnP) technique is effective. Optical PnP includes automatic 
   assignment of interface addresses, parameter information exchange 
   between neighbor nodes, database construction, and so on.

   This document assumes to use extended version of LMP (link 
   management protocol) for information exchange and describes LMP 
   extension necessary for applying to the optical PnP.

1. Introduction

   Currently we need to manually configure interface addresses of 
   links before we advertise the link-state using a GMPLS [RFC 3945] 
   routing protocol for an automatic topology discovery mechanism.
   It is a tedious task to configure interface addresses. Additionally, 
   manual configuration is error-prone process.

Internet-Draft         LMP extension for optical PnP          July 2010 


   In order to do without the tasks of configuring addresses of TE-
   links between neighbor nodes, an optical plug and play (PnP) 
   technique will be effective. Optical PnP enables automatic 
   construction of necessary information related to control-plane (c-
   plane) and data-plane (d-plane) as a trigger of fiber cable 
   injection to an interface. Specifically, optical PnP includes 
   automatic assignment of interface addresses, parameter information 
   exchange between neighbor nodes, database construction, and so on. 
   It eliminates a need for setting lots of parameters manually, 
   which leads to operation labor reduction, configuration mistake 
   avoidance, and fast network construction.

   This document proposes to use extended version of LMP (link 
   management protocol) [RFC 4204] for optical PnP information 
   exchange. In the optical PnP procedure, extended LMP makes no 
   synchronization with BeginVerify/EndVerify messages and a node 
   sends a Test message immediately after notifying d-plane interface 
   link-up (i.e., a node notifies that a cable is connected to an 
   interface). Moreover, this document proposes to add LOCAL NODE ID 
   object to a Test message in order to identify a node by which a 
   Test message is sent and with which a cable is just connected.


2. Requirement

   Optical PnP enables automatic construction of c-plane and d-plane 
   as a trigger of cable connection to node interfaces. Specifically, 
   optical PnP includes automatic assignment of interface addresses, 
   parameter information exchange between neighbor nodes, database 
   construction, and so on. 

   Automatic assignment of interface addresses is done when a cable 
   is connected to an interface and a node notifies it (link-up). An 
   interface address is assigned to the interface. TE-link address is 
   also assigned if necessary.

   Parameter information is exchanged between link-up nodes. Here, 
   parameter information includes node ID which is assigned 
   previously, interface addresses, TE-link addresses, and so on. 
   Extended LMP is used for information exchange.

   Database including local and remote node information is 
   constructed automatically after PnP information exchange. Nodes 
   advertise local and remote parameters through the c-plane for 
   carrying to all of the network nodes.

   This document assumes c-plane is either in-band or out-of-band, 
   and interfaces are organized in advance to be used as c-plane or 
   d-plane. Link-up and down should be detected as soon as possible. 
   Additionally, the amount of messages for optical PnP should be as 
   minimum as possible.

Internet-Draft         LMP extension for optical PnP          July 2010 


3. Proposal: LMP extension

3.1 Optical Plug and Play with LMP

   In order to suppress the tasks of configuring addresses of 
   wavelength links between neighbor nodes, an optical PnP technique 
   is effective. Optical PnP enables automatic construction of 
   necessary information for c-plane and d-plane as a trigger of 
   cable connection to a node interface. LMP is used to exchange 
   information between local and remote nodes necessary for 
   constructing a network. LMP has control channel management 
   procedure and link verification procedure. Control channel 
   management is used to establish control channels between adjacent 
   nodes. This is done by exchanging Config/ConfigAck messages. On 
   the other hand, link verification is used to establish data 
   channels and TE-links between adjacent nodes. Test message is used 
   to check not only regular physical connectivity verification but 
   also whether a cable is just connected between any local and 
   remote node interfaces.


3.2 Link Verification extension

   This document proposes to extend LMP in order to exchange 
   information as a trigger of link-up. There are two main extensions. 
   One is an addition of LOCAL NODE ID object to a Test message 
   during link-up detection. The other is an omission of 
   BeginVerify/EndVerify messages in link verification process. 

3.2.1    Test message extension

   VERIFY_ID object is used to uniquely identify the Verification 
   process from multiple LMP neighbors and/or parallel Test 
   procedures between the same LMP neighbors. The VERIFY_ID object 
   contains a node-unique value that is assigned by the generator of 
   the BeginVerifyAck message. A node identifies an interface and a 
   node from which a Test message is sent by checking both VRIFY ID 
   and LOCAL INTERFACE ID included in the Test message.

   Following problems occur when a node tries to identify a PnP 
   neighbor among multiple LMP neighbor nodes. Assumption is that 
   node A exchanges LMP between node B and C for link construction by 
   PnP. Node A receives Test messages from both node B and C, and 
   both Test messages have same description (LOCAL INTERFACE ID=1, 
   VERIFY ID=1). When receiving a Test message, Node A needs to reply 
   a TestStatusSuccess message including LOCAL LINK ID as TE-link 
   information. Node A, receiving same two Test messages, is able to 
   understand these two Test messages come from different nodes and

Internet-Draft         LMP extension for optical PnP          July 2010 


   replies TestStatusSuccess messages with different LOCAL LINK ID to 
   each node. A problem is, if Node A receives two Test messages with 
   (LOCAL INTERFACE ID=1, VERIFY ID=1) and (LOCAL INTERFACE ID=2, 
   VERIFY ID=1), respectively, meaning same VERYFY ID and different 
   LOCAL INTERFACE ID, it is impossible for Node A to identify which 
   node sent each Test message. Node A, therefore, does not 
   understand with who a cable is connected, and is not able to 
   assign LOCAL LINK ID for a TestStatusSuccess message.

   This document proposes to add a LOCAL NODE ID to a Test message in 
   order to identify a node by which a Test message is sent and with 
   which a cable is just connected. Here, Test message to be extended 
   is a one used for PnP procedure. Extension does not apply to Test 
   message used during regular link verification process for physical 
   connectivity verification.

   <Extended Test Message> ::= <Common Header> <LOCAL NODE ID>
                               <LOCAL_INTERFACE_ID> <VERIFY_ID>

3.2.2    Omission of BeginVerify/EndVerify synchronization

   For the purpose of LMP procedure defined in [RFC 4204], the number 
   of data channel has to be set in advance. In the network based on 
   optical PnP, the number of data channel to be set up is not known. 
   This means that the setting of data channel in advance is not 
   possible and the timing to finish link verification for data 
   channels as a trigger of link-up is not recognizable. This 
   document proposes not to use BeginVerify/BeginVerifyAck/EndVerify 
   messages. When a node notifies any data channel link-up, it 
   immediately sends a Test message to an LMP neighbor. The omission 
   of BeginVerify/BeginVerifyAck leads to faster link-up detection 
   and identification of PnP neighbors.

3.3 Extended LMP procedure

   Figure 1 illustrates LMP procedure when links are constructed by 
   optical PnP. 

   First, a cable for one of control channels is connected between 
   two nodes and they detect link-up.

   After the control channel link-up, procedures for Control Channel 
   Management follow. Messages are transmitted through the control 
   channel. In the Control Channel Management procedure, a Config 
   message is sent from one node to another. And then, corresponding 
   ConfigAck message is replied. After that, hello messages are 
   exchanged periodically. There is no LMP extension in this procedure.

Internet-Draft         LMP extension for optical PnP          July 2010 


   After the Control Channel Management procedure, nodes get 
   information necessary to activate control channels such as ccid 
   and node id of both local and remote nodes.

   Next, a cable for one of data channels is connected between two 
   nodes and they detect link-up.

   When a data channel link-up is detected, Link Verification 
   procedure follows. LMP messages are transmitted through a 
   corresponding control channel except for a Test message which is 
   transmitted through a data channel. There are extended LMP 
   messages for optical PnP in this procedure. At the beginning, a 
   Test message is sent from one node to another without 
   BeginVerify/BeginVerifyAck exchange. By adding NODE ID to a Test 
   message, with INTERFACE ID in a Test message, a node receiving the 
   Test message recognizes correspondence relationship between its 
   interface which is just link-uped, and adjacent node's interface. 
   After receiving the Test message, corresponding TestStatusSuccess 
   message is replied. Moreover, TestStatusAck message is used to 
   acknowledge receipt of the TestStatusSuccess. When Test, 
   TestStatusSuccess, and TestStatusAck message exchange in one 
   direction finishes, the same messages are exchanged in opposite 
   direction.

   After the Link Verification procedure, nodes get information 
   necessary to activate data channels such as link id and interface 
   id of both local and remote nodes.

   When link-up of other control channels or data channels are 
   detected, same procedures work.

   After these procedures, node configuration is automatically made 
   and network construction is automatically completed.

4. Future Plans

   Some mechanisms are necessary if interfaces for c-plane or d-plane 
   are chosen among link-up interfaces after optical PnP process.

   At present, target of optical PnP is in-band interface. To find an 
   out-of-band c-plane interface by optical PnP, some mechanisms are 
   necessary.


5. Security Considerations

   This document has the same security framework as [RFC 4204]. 
   However, an opportunity of LMP information exchange increases if 
   network infrastructure is constructed by optical PnP based on LMP. 
   Additionally, since no security mechanism may be set when network 
   infrastructure is constructed, careful attention is necessary. 


6. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not currently require any consideration from IANA.

Internet-Draft    GSS-API capsulate and OID comparison          May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] is a framework that provides security services to
   applications using a variety of authentication mechanisms.  There are
   widely implemented C bindings [RFC2744] for the abstract interface.

   For initial context tokens a mechanism-independent token format may
   be used, see section 3.1 of [RFC2743].  Some protocols, e.g., SASL
   GS2 [RFC5801], need the ability to add and remove this token header
   which contains some ASN.1 tags, a length and the mechanism OID to and
   from context tokens.  This document adds two GSS-API interfaces
   (GSS_Encapsulate_token and GSS_Decapsulate_token) so that GSS-API
   libraries can provide this functionality.

   Being able to compare OIDs is useful, for example when validating
   that a negotiated mechanism matched the requested one.  This document
   adds one GSS-API interface (GSS_OID_equal) for this purpose.

   The intention is that text from this specification should be possible
   to use for implementation documentation, and for this reason this
   entire document should be considered a code component.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The document uses terms from, and is structured in a similar way as,
   [RFC2743] and [RFC2744].  The normative reference to [RFC5587] is for
   the C types "gss_const_buffer_t" and "gss_const_OID", nothing else
   from that document is required to implement this document.

3.  GSS_Encapsulate_token call

      Inputs:

      o  input_token OCTET STRING -- buffer with token data to
                                     encapsulate

      o  token_oid OBJECT IDENTIFIER -- object identifier of mechanism
                                        for the token

      Outputs:

      o  major_status INTEGER

      o  output_token OCTET STRING -- Encapsulated token data; caller
                               must release with GSS_Release_buffer()

      Return major_status codes:

      o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates successful completion, and that
         output parameters holds correct information.

      o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates that encapsulation failed for
         reasons unspecified at the GSS-API level.

      GSS_Encapsulate_token() is used to add the mechanism-independent
      token header to GSS-API context token data.

      Function value:        GSS status code

      GSS_S_COMPLETE         Indicates successful completion, and
                             that output parameters holds correct
                             information.

      GSS_S_FAILURE          Indicates that encapsulation failed for

4.  GSS_Decapsulate_token call

      Inputs:

      o  input_token OCTET STRING -- buffer with token to decapsulate

      o  token_oid OBJECT IDENTIFIER -- expected object identifier

      o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates successful completion, and that
         output parameters holds correct information.

      o  GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN means that the token failed
         consistency checks (e.g., OID mismatch or ASN.1 DER length
         errors).

      o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates that decapsulation failed for
         reasons unspecified at the GSS-API level.

      GSS_Decapsulate_token() is used to remove the mechanism-
      independent token header from an initial GSS-API context token.

     OM_uint32
     gss_decapsulate_token (
       gss_const_buffer_t input_token,
       gss_const_OID token_oid,
       gss_buffer_t output_token)

      Purpose:

      Parameters:

      input_token      buffer, opaque, read
                       Buffer with GSS-API context token.

      token_oid        Object ID, read

      Function value:        GSS status code

      GSS_S_COMPLETE         Indicates successful completion, and
                             that output parameters holds correct
                             information.

      GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN  Means that the token failed consistency
                             checks (e.g., OID mismatch or ASN.1 DER

5.  GSS_OID_equal call

      Inputs:

      o  first_oid OBJECT IDENTIFIER -- first object identifier
                                        to compare

      o  second_oid OBJECT IDENTIFIER -- second object identifier
                                         to compare

      Return codes:

      o  non-0 when neither OID is GSS_C_NO_OID and the two OIDs
         are equal.

      o  0 when the two OIDs are not identical or either OID is
         equal to GSS_C_NO_OID.

      GSS_OID_equal() is used to add compare two OIDs for equality.  The
      value GSS_C_NO_OID will not match any OID, including GSS_C_NO_OID
      itself.

5.1.  gss_oid_equal

     extern int
     gss_oid_equal (
       gss_const_OID first_oid,
       gss_const_OID second_oid
     )

      Purpose:

      Compare two OIDs for equality.  The value GSS_C_NO_OID will not
      match any OID, including GSS_C_NO_OID itself.

      Parameters:

      first_oid        Object ID, read
                       First object identifier to compare.

      second_oid       Object ID, read
                       Second object identifier to compare.

      Function value:        GSS status code

      non-0                  Neither OID is GSS_C_NO_OID and the
                             two OIDs are equal.

      0                      When the two OIDs are not identical or
                             either OID is equal to GSS_C_NO_OID.

6.  Test vector

   For the GSS_Encapsulate_token function, if the "input_token" buffer
   is the 3 bytes octet sequence "foo" and the "token_oid" OID is
   1.2.840.113554.1.2.2, which encoded corresponds to the 9 bytes long
   octet sequence (using C notation)
   "\x2a\x86\x48\x86\xf7\x12\x01\x02\x02", the output should be the 16
   byte long octet sequence (again in C notation)
   "\x60\x0e\x06\x09\x2a\x86\x48\x86\xf7\x12\x01\x02\x02\x66\x6f\x6f".
   These values may be used to also test the GSS_Decapsulate_token
   interface.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Greg Hudson pointed out the 'const' problem with the C bindings in
   earlier versions of this document, and Luke Howard suggested to
   resolve it by using the RFC 5587 types.  Stephen Farrell suggested
   several editorial improvements and the security consideration
   regarding absent security features of the encapsulation function.
   Chris Lonvick suggested some improvements.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the base GSS-API specification
   ([RFC2743]) and the base C bindings ([RFC2744]) are inherited.

   Encapsulation of data does not provide any kind of integrity or
   confidentiality.

   Implementations needs to treat input as potentially untrustworthy for
   purposes of dereferencing memory objects to avoid security
   vulnerabilities.  In particular, ASN.1 DER length fields is a common
   source of mistakes.

Internet-Draft    GSS-API capsulate and OID comparison        April 2011


1.  Introduction

   Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] is a framework that provides security services to
   applications using a variety of authentication mechanisms.  There are
   widely implemented C bindings [RFC2744] for the abstract interface.

   For initial context tokens a mechanism-independent token format may
   be used, see section 3.1 of [RFC2743].  Some protocols, e.g., SASL
   GS2 [RFC5801], needs the ability to add and remove the token header
   from context tokens.  This document adds two GSS-API interfaces
   (GSS_Encapsulate_token and GSS_Decapsulate_token) so that GSS-API
   libraries can provide this functionality.

   Being able to compare OIDs is useful, for example when validating
   that an negotiated mechanism matched the requested one.  This
   document adds one GSS-API interface (GSS_OID_equal) for this purpose.

   The intention is that text from this specification should be possible
   to use for implementation documentation, and for this reason this
   entire document should be considered a code component.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The document uses terms from, and is structured in a similar way as,
   [RFC2743] and [RFC2744].  The normative reference to [RFC5587] is for
   the C types "gss_const_buffer_t" and "gss_const_OID", nothing else
   from that document is required to implement this document.

3.  GSS_Encapsulate_token call

      Inputs:

      o  input_token OCTET STRING -- buffer with token data to
                                     encapsulate

      o  token_oid OBJECT IDENTIFIER -- object identifier of mechanism
                                        for the token

      Outputs:

      o  major_status INTEGER

      o  output_token OCTET STRING -- Encapsulated token data; caller
                               must release with GSS_Release_buffer()

      Return major_status codes:

      o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates successful completion, and that
         output parameters holds correct information.

      o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates that encapsulation failed for
         reasons unspecified at the GSS-API level.

      GSS_Encapsulate_token() is used to add the mechanism-independent
      token header to GSS-API context token data.

      Function value:        GSS status code

      GSS_S_COMPLETE         Indicates successful completion, and
                             that output parameters holds correct
                             information.

      GSS_S_FAILURE          Indicates that encapsulation failed for

      Inputs:

      o  input_token OCTET STRING -- buffer with token to decapsulate

      o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates successful completion, and that
         output parameters holds correct information.

      o  GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN means that the token failed
         consistency checks (e.g., OID mismatch or ASN.1 DER length
         errors).

      o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates that decapsulation failed for
         reasons unspecified at the GSS-API level.

      GSS_Decapsulate_token() is used to remove the mechanism-
      independent token header from an initial GSS-API context token.

8.  Security Considerations

   Implementations needs to treat input as potentially untrustworthy for
   purposes of dereferencing memory objects to avoid security
   vulnerabilities.  In particular, ASN.1 DER length fields is a common
   source of mistakes.

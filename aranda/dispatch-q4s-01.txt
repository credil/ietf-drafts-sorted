Abstract

   This memo describes an application level protocol for the standard
   communication of e2e QoS compliance information using a protocol
   based on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis
   for the World Wide Web, and Session Description Protocol (SDP).
   Quality for Service Protocol (Q4S) provides a mechanism for latency,
   jitter, bandwidth an packet loss negotiation and monitoring,
   alerting whenever one of the negotiated conditions is violated.

   Implementation details on the actions to be triggered upon
   reception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are out
   of scope of this draft, it is application dependant (e.g. increase
   quality, reduce bit-rate) or even network dependant (e.g. change
   connection's quality profile).

1. Introduction

      The World Wide Web (WWW) is a distributed hypermedia system which
   has gained widespread acceptance among Internet users. Although WWW
   browsers support other, preexisting Internet application protocols,
   the native and primary protocol used between WWW clients and servers
   is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (RFC 2616 [1]).  The ease
   of use of the Web has prompted its widespread employment as a
   client/server architecture for many applications.  Many of such
   applications require the client and the server to be able to
   communicate each other and exchange information with certain quality
   constraints.

   Quality in communications at application level consists of four
   measurable parameters:

      o Latency: The time a message takes to travel from source to
         destination. It may be approximated to RTT/2 (Round trip time),
         assuming the networks are symmetrical.

      o Jitter: latency variation. There are some formulas to calculate
         Jitter, and in this context we will consider the statistical
         variance formula.

      o Bandwidth: To assure the quality, a protocol MUST assure the
         availability of bandwidth needed by the application.

      o Packet loss: The percentage of packet loss is closely related
         to bandwidth and jitter. Affects bandwidth because a high
         packet loss implies sometimes retransmissions that also
         consumes extra bandwidth, other times the retransmissions are
         not achieved (for example in video streaming over UDP) and the
         information received is less than the required bandwidth. In
         terms of jitter, a packet loss sometimes is seen by the
         destination like a larger time between arrivals, causing a
         jitter growth.

   Q4S provides a mechanism for quality monitoring based on HTTP and
   SDP in order to be easily integrated in WWW, but it may be used by
   any type of application, not only those based on HTTP. Quality
   requirements may be needed by any type of application that
   communicates using any kind of protocol, especially those which have
   real-time constraints. Depending on the nature of each application
   the constraints may be different leading to different parameter
   thresholds that need to be met.

   Q4S is an application level Client/Server protocol that continuously
   measures session quality for a given flow (or set of flows), end-to-
   end and in real-time; raising an alert if quality parameters are
   below a given pre-negotiated threshold. Q4S describes when these
   alerts need to be sent and the entity receiving them. The actions
   undertaken by the receiver of the alert are out of scope of the
   protocol.

   Q4S is session-independent from the application flows, in order to
   minimize the impact on them. To perform the measurements, two
   control flows are created on both communication paths (forward and
   reverse direction).

   1.1. Motivation

   Monitoring quality of service (QoS) in computer networks is useful
   for several reasons:

      o Enable real-time services and applications to verify whether
         network resources achieve a certain QoS level.

      o Monitoring helps real-time services and applications to run
         through the Internet, allowing the existence of Application
         Content providers (ACPs) which offer guaranteed real-time
         services to the final users.

      o Monitoring also applies to Peer to Peer (P2P) real-time
         applications

      o Enable ISPs to offer QoS to any ACP or final user application
         in an accountable way

      o Enable e2e negotiation of QoS parameters, independently of the
         Internet service providers of both endpoints.

   A protocol to monitor QoS must address the following issues:

      o Must be ready to be used in conjunction with current standard
         protocols and applications, without forcing a change on them.

      o Must have a formal and compact way to specify quality
         constraints of the desired application to run.

      o Must have measurement mechanisms avoiding application
         disruption.

      o Must have specific messages to alert about the violation of
         quality constraints in different directions (forward and
         reverse), because network routing may not be symmetrical, and
         of course, quality constraints may not be symmetrical.

      o Must protect the data (constrains, measurements, QoS levels
         demanded from the network) in order to avoid the injection of
         malicious data in the measurements.

   1.2. Summary of Features

      Quality for Service is a message-oriented communication protocol
   that can be used in conjunction with any other application-level
   protocol.

   The benefits in quality enhancement provided by Q4S can be used by
   any type of application that uses any type of protocol for data
   transport. It provides a quality monitoring scheme for any
   communication that takes place between the client and the server,
   not only the Q4S communication itself.

   Q4S does not establish multimedia sessions and it does not transport
   application data. It monitors the fulfillment of the quality
   requirements of the communication between the client and the server,
   and therefore does not impose any restrictions on the type of
   application, protocol or the type of usage of the monitored quality
   connection.

   Some applications may vary their quality requirements dynamically
   for any given quality parameter. Q4S is able to adapt to the
   changing application needs modifying the parameter thresholds to the
   new values and monitoring the network quality according to the new
   constraints. It will raise alerts if the new constraints are
   violated.

   Q4S session lifetime is composed of four phases with different
   purposes. Two phases perform network parameter measurements as per a
   negotiated measurement procedure. Different measurement procedures
   COULD be used inside Q4S, although one default measurement mechanism
   is needed for compatibility reasons and is the one defined in this
   draft. Basically, Q4S defines how to transport application quality
   requirements SLA and measurement results between client and server
   and provides, as well, monitoring and alerting.

   Q4S MUST be executed just before starting a client-server
   application which needs a quality connection in terms of latency,
   jitter, bandwidth and/or packet loss. Once client and server have
   succeeded in establishing communication under quality constraints,
   the application can start, and Q4S continues measuring and alerting
   if necessary.

   During the lifetime of the application, the protocol periodically
   renews the session measurements and alerts if the measured values of
   quality parameters do not meet the negotiated application
   requirements.

   The quality parameters can be suggested by the client in the first
   message of the handshake phase, but it's the server that accepts
   these parameter values or forces others. The server is in charge of
   deciding the final values of quality connection.


2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

3. Overview of Operation

      This section introduces the basic operation of Q4S using simple
   examples.  This section is of tutorial nature and does not contain
   any normative statements.

   The first example shows the basic functions of a Q4S: communication
   establishment between a client and a server, quality requirement
   negotiations for the requested application, application start and
   continuous quality parameter measurements, and finally communication
   termination. The message exchange is depicted in Figure 1.

   The client triggers the establishment of the communication
   requesting a specific service or application from the server. This
   first message must have a special URI (RFC 3986), which forces the
   use of the Q4S protocol if it is implemented in a standard web
   browser. This message consists of a Q4S BEGIN method, which can
   optionally include initial communication quality requirements in an
   SDP body.

   This request is answered by the server with an Q4S 200 OK method
   letting the client know that it accepts the request. This message
   MUST contain an SDP body with the quality constraints required by
   the requested application and the measurement procedure to use.

   Once the communication has been established, the protocol will
   verify that the communication path between the client and the server
   meets the quality constraints on both directions, from and to the
   server. This requires taking measurements of the quality parameters:
   latencies, jitter, bandwidth and packet loss. This phase is
   initiated with a client message containing a Q4S READY method, which
   will be answered by the server with a Q4S 200 OK response.

Internet-Draft    The Quality for Services Protocol          June 2011


   Measurements are being taken and communicated to each other through
   Q4S PING messages sent both from the client and the server. All Q4S
   PING requests will be answered by Q4S 200 OK messages to allow for
   bidirectional measurements.

   After a pre-agreed number of measurements, determined by the
   measurement procedure as sent by the server, have been performed,
   the client will send a Q4S GET message to the server containing the
   measured values of all quality parameters from its point of view.
   The server receives this message and if the values meet the
   necessary requirements answers with a Q4S 200 OK method.

   As the communication meets the conditions, the application will
   start. Q4S will continue to measure the communication parameters
   verifying that the real-time application can keep executing under
   quality conditions. This will be done through the Q4S PING message
   exchange on both connection paths.

   Once the client wants to terminate the communication it sends a Q4S
   CANCEL message, which will be acknowledged by the server with
   another Q4S CANCEL message.

   The second example shows the behavior of Q4S protocol in the event
   of the loss of quality for a given parameter constraint: detection
   of a the violation of specific parameter constraints after
   continuous measurements of network parameters, the raising of an
   alert, the termination in case of non recovery of the quality
   communication. This message exchange is depicted in Figure 2.

    Figure 2 Q4S message exchange with quality constraints not reached.



   The initiation of the communication happens in the same way as in
   the first example establishing communication from the client to the
   server through a Q4S BEGIN message answered by the server if ready

   with a Q4S 200 OK. In this case, the server indicates the presence
   of a policy server, which will receive the alerts. The policy server
   is an entity that can act on the network. It has a set of different
   quality levels defined and pre-agreed upon between the ACD and the
   ISP.

   Then the measurements are taken in order to verify if the
   communication conditions meet the quality constraints of the
   application through an exchange of Q4S PING requests and Q4S 200 OK
   responses. The client sends the server the measured values in a Q4S
   GET message and waits for the answer with the actions to take.

   In this case, some or many of the quality constraints are not met
   and the server sends a Q4S 412 message indicating that a pre-
   condition as not been met.

   The client will then send a Q4S QOS-ALERT message to the policy
   server. The policy server responds to the client with a Q4S 100
   trying message and notifies the server of the received alert. The
   policy server will verify the authorization credentials and raise
   the quality of service level acting on the network elements as per
   SLA agreement between the ACP and the ISP, which are out of scope of
   this protocol description.

   After a delay, the client and server will initiate the quality
   parameter measurements through more Q4S PING and Q4S 200 OK
   messages. If the quality of the communication cannot be met, the
   client closes the connection with a Q4S CANCEL message acknowledged
   by the server with another Q4S CANCEL.



4.  Protocol

   This section describes the measurement procedures, the SDP structure
   of the Q4S messages, the different Q4S protocol phases and the
   messages exchanged in them.



   4.1. Protocol Phases

      All elements of the IP network contribute to the quality in terms
   of latency, jitter, bandwidth and packet loss. All these elements
   have their own quality policies in terms of priorities, traffic
   mode, etc. and each element has its own way to manage the quality.
   The purpose of a quality connection is to establish an end-to-end

   communication with enough quality for the application to function
   flawlessly.

   To monitor quality constraints of the application, four phases are
   defined and can be shown in Figure 3.

      o Handshake phase: in which the server is contacted by the client
         and in the answer message the quality constraints for the
         application is communicated.

      o Negotiation phase: in which the quality of the connection is
         measured in both directions (latency, jitter, bandwidth and
         packet loss), and Q4S messages may be sent in order to alert if
         the measured quality does not match the constraints. This phase
         is iterative until quality constraints are reached or the
         session is cancelled after a number of measurement cycles
         without meeting the quality constraints. Just after reaching
         the quality requirements, Q4S provides a simple optional
         mechanism to start the application, which will benefit from
         quality connection from the beginning, using HTTP.

      o Continuity phase: in which quality is continuously measured. If
         quality becomes degraded, an alert shall be issued. New
         measurements may follow up to a negotiated maximum before
         moving to Termination phase if constraints cannot be met. In
         this phase the measurements MUST avoid disturbing application
         by consuming network resources.

      o Termination phase: in which the session is terminated.

   4.2. SDP Structure

   The original goal of SDP was to announce necessary information for
   the participants and multicast MBONE (Multicast Backbone)
   applications. Right now, its use has been extended to the
   announcement and the negotiation of multimedia sessions. The purpose
   of Q4S is not to establish media stream sessions, but to monitor a
   quality connection. This connection may be later used to establish
   any type of session including media sessions; Q4S does not impose
   any conditions on the type of communication requiring quality
   parameters.

   SDP will be used by Q4S to exchange quality constraints and will
   therefore always have all the media attributes ("m") set to zero.

   The SDP embedded in the messages is the container of the quality
   parameters. As these may vary depending on the direction of the
   communication (to and from the client) all quality parameters need
   to specify the uplink and downlink values: <uplink> / <downlink>.
   When one or both of these values are empty, it MUST be understood as
   needing no constraint on this parameter and that direction.

   The uplink direction MUST be considered as being the communication
   from the client to the server. The downlink direction MUST be
   considered as being the communication from the server to the client.

   The SDP information can comprise all or some of the following
   parameters shown in the example below: This is an example of an SDP
   message used by Q4S.

      4.2.1. qos-level attribute

   The "qos-level" attribute contains the QoS level for uplink and
   downlink. Default values are 0 for both directions. The meaning of
   each level is out of scope of Q4S, but a higher level SHOULD
   correspond to a better service quality.

   The "qos-level" attribute may be changed during the protocol
   lifetime raising or lowering the value as necessary following the
   network measurements and the application needs.

      4.2.2. public-address attributes

   This attribute contains the public IP address of the client and the
   server. The server fills these attributes with his own public IP
   address and the public IP address of the first message received from
   the client in the handshake phase.

      4.2.3. latency attribute

   The maximum uplink and downlink latency tolerance are specified in
   the "latency" attribute, expressed in milliseconds.

      4.2.4. jitter attribute

   The maximum uplink and downlink jitter tolerance are specified in
   the "jitter" attribute, expressed in milliseconds.

      4.2.5. bandwidth attribute

   The minimum uplink and downlink bandwidth are specified in the
   "bandwidth" attribute, expressed in kbps.

      4.2.6. packetloss attribute

   The maximum uplink and downlink packet loss tolerance are specified
   in the "packetloss" attribute expressed in percentage.

      4.2.7. flow attributes

   These attributes specify the flows (protocol, source IP, source Port
   + destination IP, destination port) of data over TCP and UDP ports
   to be used in uplink and downlink communications.

   Several "flow" attributes can be defined. The goal is to monitor
   each flow to verify that the quality constraints are met. These
   flows identify the direction (uplink or downlink), the protocol (TCP
   or UDP) (RFC 761 [8] and RFC 768 [9]) and the ports that are going
   to be used by the application data and, of course, by the Q4S
   control flows (for quality measurements), because the quality
   measurements MUST be achieved over the same quality session for each
   direction. All defined flows will be considered within the same
   quality profile, which is determined by the qos-level attribute in
   each direction.

   During negotiation phase the specified control ports will be used
   for Q4S messages, and this is the reason to separate application
   data ports from Q4S control ports, otherwise they could collide.

   The control should involve two UDP flows, one uplink and one
   downlink, and two TCP flows, again one uplink and one downlink.
   Application data MAY consist of many flows, depending on the nature
   of the application. The handshake phase takes place through the
   Contact URI, using TCP port 80 for example. However, the negotiation

Internet-Draft    The Quality for Services Protocol          June 2011


   phase will take place on the specified control ports (UDP and TCP)
   using the Session URI.

   The "downlink port" is a port in which the client listens for server
   requests and MUST be used as origin port of client responses. The
   "uplink port" is a port in which server is listening for incoming
   messages from the client and MUST be used as origin port of server
   responses.

   If the server's "downlink" port is null (a=flow:control downlink
   TCP/0), the client May choose one randomly as per OS standard rules.
   "Downlink" ports inside the SDP must always be matched against
   actual received port values on the server side in order to deal with
   NAT/NATP devices.

      4.2.8. Measurement attributes

   These attributes contain the measurement procedure and the results
   of the quality measurements.

   Measurement parameters are included using the session attribute
   "measurement". The first measurement parameter is the procedure. Q4S
   provides a "default" procedure for measurements, but others like
   RTP/RTCP might be used and defined later. This draft will only
   define and explain the "default" procedure.

   In the initial client request a set of measurement procedures can be
   sent to the server for negotiation. One measurement procedure line
   MUST be included in the SDP message for each proposed method. The
   server MUST answer with only one line with the chosen procedure.

   For each procedure, a set of values of parameters separated by ","
   can be included in the same attribute line. The amount and type of
   parameters depends on the procedure type.

   In the following example the "default" procedure type is chosen:

   a=measurement:procedure default,50/50,75/75,5000,1,40/80,100/256


   In the "default" procedure, the meaning of these parameters is:

      o The first parameter is the interval of time (in milliseconds)
         between PING requests during the negotiation phase. Uplink and
         downlink values from the client's point of view are separated
         by "/". This allows having different responsiveness values
         depending on the control resources used in each direction.

      o The second parameter is the time interval (in milliseconds)
         between PING requests during the continuity phase. Forward and
         reverse values are separated by "/". This allows having two
         different responsiveness values depending on the control
         resources used in each direction.

      o The third parameter is the time interval to be used to measure
         bandwidth during the negotiation phase. If not present, a

      o The fourth parameter indicates the operation mode during the
         continuity phase. Two values are defined: 0 means "normal" mode
         and 1 means "sliding window" mode. If not present, normal mode
         (default value of 0) will be assumed. These modes of operation
         will be described in [4.7].

      o The fifth parameter is only applicable in sliding window mode.
         It indicates the window size for jitter and latency
         calculations. If not present, a value of 256 MUST be assumed.
         Forward and reverse values are separated by "/".

      o The sixth parameter is only applicable in sliding window mode.
         It indicates the window size for packet loss calculations. If

         reverse values are separated by "/".

   There are four more measurement attributes:

   a=measurement:latency 10000/10000
   a=measurement:jitter 10000/10000
   a=measurement:bandwidth 0/0
   a=measurement:packetloss 0/0


   The latency, jitter, bandwidth and packetloss measurement attributes
   contain the values measured for each of these quality parameters in
   uplink and downlink directions. Quality parameters values in these
   measurement attributes provide a snapshot of the quality level
   reached in each measurement stage.

   They can be omitted during the initial protocol phases as no
   measurements have been taken, but they MUST be filled in when
   sending GET requests and 412 responses.



   4.3. Measurements

   This section describes the way quality parameters are measured as
   defined by the "default" procedure.

      4.3.1. Latency

   Q4S defines a PING method in order to exchange packets between the
   client and the server. Based on this PING exchange the client and
   the server are able to calculate the round trip time (RTT). The RTT

   is the sum of downlink latency (normally named "reverse latency")
   and uplink latency (normally named "forward latency").

   At least 255 samples of RTT MUST be taken by the client. As the
   forward and reverse latencies are unknown the client and server will
   assume that the network is symmetric. The latency will therefore be
   calculated as the average value of all the RTT samples divided by 2.



      4.3.2. Jitter

   The jitter can be calculated independently by the client and by the
   server. The downlink jitter is calculated by the client taking into
   account the time interval between PING requests as defined by the
   measurement procedure attribute in the first or second parameter
   depending on the Q4S protocol phase. The client and the server MUST
   send these PING requests at the specified intervals. The client
   measures the downlink jitter whereas the server measures the uplink
   jitter. Note that PING responses are not taken into account when
   calculating jitter values.

   Every time a request message is received by an endpoint (either
   server or client), the corresponding jitter value is updated using
   the Statistical Jitter value calculated on the first 255 packets
   received using the statistical variance formula:


      Jitter Statistical = SquareRootOf(SumOf((ElapsedTime[i]-
   Average)^2)/(ReceivedPacketCount-1))


   Each endpoint sends a PING periodically with a fixed interval, each
   value of "elapsed time" (ET) should be very close to this interval.
   If a PING message is lost, the elapsed time value is doubled.
   Identifying lost PING messages, however, is not an issue because all
   PING messages are labeled with a Sequence-Number header. Therefore
   the receiver can discard this elapsed time value.

   In order to have the first jitter sample, the receiver MUST wait
   until it receives 3 PING requests, because each ET is the time
   between two PINGs and a Jitter needs at least two ET.

   After 255 samples the client has the values of RTT and downlink
   jitter and the server has RTT and uplink jitter.

      4.3.3. Bandwidth

   In order to measure the available bandwidth, both the client and the
   server MUST start sending DATA messages simultaneously using the UDP
   control ports exchanged during the handshake phase in the SDP
   message, at the needed rate to verify the availability of the
   bandwidth constraint in each direction using messages of 1 Kbyte in
   length. The messages are sent during the period of time defined in
   the third parameter of the SDP measurement procedure attribute in
   millisecond units. If this parameter is not present, a value of 5
   seconds SHOULD be used by default.

             Figure 6  Bandwidth and packet loss measurements.

   The goal of these measurements is not to identify the bandwidth of
   the Internet connection but to determine if the required bandwidth
   is available, meeting the application's constraints. Therefore, the
   requested bandwidth MUST be measured sending only that bit rate.

   When measuring bandwidth, all DATA requests sent MUST be 1 kilobyte
   in length (UDP payload length), and MUST include a Sequence-Number
   header with a sequential number starting at 0. The Sequence-Number
   MUST be incremented by 1 with each sent DATA packet. If any
   measurement stage needs to be repeated, the values MUST start at
   zero again. DATA requests MUST NOT be answered. Examples:

   The client MUST send DATA packets to the server to allow the server
   to measure the uplink bandwidth. The server MUST send DATA packets
   to the client to allow the client to measure the downlink bandwidth.

   When the measurement time interval is over, the client and the
   server have a collection of server messages and can calculate the
   downlink and uplink bandwidth respectively.



      4.3.4. Packet loss

   Packet loss and bandwidth are measured simultaneously using the DATA
   packets sent by both the client and the server. Because the DATA
   packets contain a Sequence-Number header incremented sequentially
   with each sent packet, lost packets can be easily identified. The
   lost packets have to be counted during the measurement time.

   4.4. Handshake Phase

   The first phase consists of a Q4S BEGIN method issued from the
   client to the server.

   The first Q4S message MUST have a special URI (RFC 3986 [4]), which
   forces the use of the Q4S protocol if it is implemented in a
   standard web browser.

   This URI, named "Contact URI", is used to request the start of a
   session. Its scheme MUST be:

         "q4s:" "//" host [":" port] [path["?" query]

   Optionally, the client can send the desired quality parameters
   (enclosed in the body of the message as an SDP document) and the
   server can take them into account when it builds the answer with the
   final values, following a request / response schema (RFC 3464 [5]).
   The description of these quality parameters is attached in an SDP
   document.

   If the request is accepted, the server MUST answer with a Q4S 200 OK
   message, and in the body of the answer message, an SDP document MUST
   be included (RFC 4566 [2]), with information about the required
   quality constraints. Q4S responses should use the protocol
   designator "Q4S/1.0".

   After these two messages are exchanged, the first phase is
   completed. The quality parameters have been sent to the client. Next
   step is to measure the quality of the communication path between the
   client and the server and alert if the SLA is being violated.

   The "Expires" header purpose is to provide a sanity check and
   enables the server to close inactive sessions. If the client does
   not send a new request before the expiration time, the server can
   close the session.

   The "Signature" header contains a digital signature that can be used
   by the network to validate the SDP, preventing security attacks.

   The signature is an optional header generated by the server using a
   hash and encryption method such as MD5 (RFC 1321 [6]) and RSA (RFC
   2437 [7]), but it depends on the certificate used by the server.
   This certificate is supposed to be delivered by a Certification
   Authority (CA) or policy owner to the server. The signature is
   applied to the SDP body.

       Signature= RSA ( MD5 (<sdp>), <certificate> )

   If the signature is not present, other validation mechanism may be
   implemented in order to provide assured quality with security and
   control.

   The optional response header "Q4S-Resource-Server" contains the
   Session URI, which is in charge of this session. This URI MUST be
   invoked by the client in all later requests. Example:

   Q4S-Resource-server: \
   q4s://www.example.com/example/util/agent?num=666

   If this header is not present, the client will continue sending all
   requests to the original Contact URI, but if it is present, its use
   is mandatory.

   The last optional response header is "Q4S-Policy-Server" which
   contains the "Policy Server URI" towards which client MUST send the
   later QOS-ALERT messages. If the "Q4S-Policy-Server" header is
   present, the "Q4S-Resource-server" header is mandatory, as the
   policy server MUST notify the Q4S server about the Q4S-ALERT
   received from the client and this information in not available to
   the policy server except through the "Q4S-Resource-server" header.

   During the next phases of the protocol, the client role will perform
   a mix of client and server role. Hence, the client can specify a
   "Q4S-Resource-Client" header in the BEGIN request, indicating the
   Resource Client URI, a relative URI in charge of the server requests
   when client receives requests from the server. Example:

   Q4S-Resource-Client: /example/useragent

   This URI MUST be relative because user agents may not have an
   associated domain, or its IP address is unknown.



   4.5. Negotiation phase

   The negotiation phase is in charge of measuring the quality
   parameters and verifying that the communication paths meet the
   required quality constraints. If the quality session is compliant
   with the minimum quality constraints the application can start. If
   not, a higher quality service level will be demanded and the results
   on the network parameters will be measured again. If after some time
   the quality constraints cannot be met the quality session is
   terminated due.

   The steps to be taken in this phase depend on the measurement
   procedure exchanged during the handshake phase. This document only
   describes the "default" procedure, but others can be used, like
   RTP/RTCP (RFC 3550 [10]).

   Measurements of latency and jitter are done calculating the
   differences in arrival times of packets and can be achieved with
   little bandwidth consumption. The bandwidth measurement, on the
   other hand, involves higher bandwidth consumption in both directions
   (uplink and downlink).

   To avoid wasting unnecessary network resources these two types of
   measurements will be performed in two separate stages. If the
   required latencies and jitters cannot be reached, it makes no sense
   to waste network resources measuring bandwidth. In addition, if
   achieving the required latency and jitter thresholds implies
   upgrading the quality session level, the chance of obtaining
   compliant bandwidth measurements without retries is higher, saving
   network traffic again. Therefore, the default procedure, determines
   that the measurements are taken in two stages:

      o Stage 0: Measurement of latencies, jitters and packet loss

      o Stage 1: Measurement of bandwidths and packet loss

   Notice that packet loss can be measured in both stages, as all
   messages exchanged include a sequence-number header that allows for
   easy packet loss detection.

   The client starts the negotiation phase sending a READY request
   using the TCP control ports defined in the SDP. This READY request
   includes a "Stage" header that indicates the measurement stage.

   If either jitter, latency or both are specified, the negotiation
   phase begins with the measurement of latencies and jitters (stage
   0). If none of those attributes are specified, stage 0 is skipped.

   This triggers the exchange of a sequence of PING requests and
   responses that will lead to the calculation of RTT (latency), jitter
   and packet loss as described in section 4.3.

   Client Request:
   =========================
          PING q4s://www.example.com Q4S/1.0
          Session-Id: 53655765
          Sequence-Number: 0

   Server Response:
   =========================
     Q4S/1.0 200 OK
          Session-Id: 53655765
          Sequence-Number: 0
          Content-Length: 0
   =========================

   The function of the PING method is similar to the ICMP echo request
   message. The server MUST answer as soon as it receives the message.

   Both endpoints MUST send Q4S PING messages with the periodicity
   specified in the first parameter of SDP measurement procedure
   attribute, using always the same UDP control ports and incrementing
   the Sequence-Number with each message and MUST NOT wait for a
   response to send the next PING request. The "Sequence-Number" header
   value is a sequential integer number and MUST start at zero. If this
   stage is repeated, the initial Sequence-Number MUST start again at
   zero.

   Optionally the PING request can include:

     -  a "Timestamp" header, with the time in which the message has
        been sent. In case the header is present, the server MUST
        include the header in the response without changing the value.

     -  a "Measurements" header, with the values of the jitter and
        packet loss measured by each entity. The client will send its
        measurements to the server and the server his measurements to
        the client. Example : Measurements: 13, 1

     -  a "Qualimeter" header, with the value in percentage of
        experienced versus desired quality.

    In following example, the SDP measurement procedure attribute, this
   value is 50 milliseconds (from the client to the server) and 60ms
   (from the server to the client).

   A minimum of 256 PING messages MUST be exchanged in order to be able
   to measure latency, jitter and packet-loss. Both the client and the
   server calculate the respective measured parameter values. The
   mechanisms to calculate the different parameters are described in
   section 4.3.

   Then the client MUST send a GET request to the server using the TCP
   uplink control port exchanged in the handshake phase in order to
   communicate the measured parameters to the server. This message MUST
   always be sent, independently of the measurement procedure used. The
   GET request contains a body with updated downlink values for the
   latency, jitter and packet loss measurement attributes.

   An example of a GET request can be seen below.

   It means that the client and the server have finalized Stage 0 and
   are ready for Stage 1, bandwidth and packet loss measurement.

   If the bandwidth constraints are empty or with value zero, the
   negotiation phase MUST terminate and both client and server initiate
   the Continuity Phase.

   The second case, in which some constraint has not been met is
   detailed in section 4.5.3. Constraints not reached.



      4.5.2. Stage 1: Measurement of bandwidth and packet loss

   This stage begins in a similar way to stage 0, sending a READY

   value is 1. The server answers with a Q4S 200 OK message to
   synchronize the initiation of the measurements.

   If measurements match the constraints, the negotiation phase is
   successful, the client and server have verified that all constraints
   are met and the application can be started. An optional simple
   mechanism, based on HTTP, is defined to trigger the application
   using the "Trigger-URI" header.

   The server answer MUST be 200 OK, and MAY include the URI for
   triggering the application using an optional "Trigger-URI" header.

   The application SHOULD be triggered using an URI, by means of an
   HTTP request, specified in the Q4S header "Trigger-URI". Other
   mechanisms, such as including a "Location" header in the Q4S
   message, to force redirection is not recommended because these
   mechanisms are achieved without parsing the body of the message.

      4.5.3. Constraints not reached

   After a measurement period the client sends the measured parameters
   in the SDP body of a GET request to the server.

   If there is any parameter that does not comply with the uplink or
   downlink quality constraints required, the server MUST answer the
   client's GET request with a 412 message (a precondition setting
   required by the client or server has not been met) indicating in the
   method type the parameter or parameters that violate the
   constraints. This message MUST contain an SDP body with all data,
   the client's and the server's parameter measurements.

   The 412 message MUST include two additional headers: Cause and
   Signature headers. The Cause: header includes information about the
   direction and the parameter that did not meet the constraints. The

   At this point, both client and server wait for "Guard-Time" seconds
   as specified by the header before attempting to re-initiate the
   measurements that caused the alert. This time SHOULD be set such
   that enough time has been given to allow the server to take any
   actions notifying the application or allowing for the network to
   recover. (5 seconds should be enough, but this depends on each
   case). After "Guard-Time" seconds the measurement process MUST be
   initiated by the client sending a READY request.

   If the client does not obey the "Guard-time", and sends a READY
   message before this time elapses, the server MUST wait and not
   answer the READY message until the guard time has elapsed.

   If during the measurement process some interference disturbs or
   affects the measurement results, it is better to repeat the process
   again rather than alerting of an SLA violation. This is always
   possible by sending current values of parameter "qos-level" without
   changes, and in this case a header Guard-time can be set to "0". It
   is a good practice to repeat the measurements before reporting a
   violation.

   An example of a message exchange with several guard-times is shown
   below.

          4.5.3.1. Policy server is present

   If during handshake phase the optional header Q4S-Policy-Server is
   included in the server response, the QOS-ALERT request MUST be sent
   to the policy server, which can implement all or some of these
   features (but not exclusive to):

      o Client and server validation in terms of SLA.

      o Authentication (Signature validation) and security (block
         malicious clients)

      o Policy rules (following rules are only examples):

           - Maximum quality level allowed for the ACP

           - Time bands allowed for provide quality sessions for the ACP

           - Number of simultaneous quality sessions allowed

           - Maximum time used by quality sessions allowed

           - Etc.

   With policy server, the QOS-ALERT message sent by the client MUST
   contain the URIs of the server and the client to be contacted later
   by the policy server. Therefore the following headers MUST be
   included in the client request: "Q4S-Resource-server" and
   "Q4S-Resource-client"

   Depending on the results of the operations achieved by the policy
   server, the client could receive different types of errors or CANCEL
   messages.

   The flows of messages in this case are in the following figure:

                        Figure 13  Policy server.

   If the validation or authentication of the QOS-ALERT operation
   fails, the policy server will send a CANCEL request to the client
   without contacting the server.

   If any of the policy rules fail, the server will send a 6XX error to
   the client, indicating the rule that is not satisfied.

   Only if the validation, authentication and policy checking are
   successful, the server is contacted by the policy server and the
   QOS-ALERT message is forwarded to it.

      4.5.4. QoS Level changes

   If any constraint was violated, the server may raise by one the qos-
   level attribute of the 412 message sent to the client. The maximum
   qos-level allowed is 9, both uplink and downlink.

   If the qos-level has reached the maximum value for downlink or
   uplink without matching the constraints, then a CANCEL request MUST
   be sent by the client using the TCP port determined in the handshake
   phase in order to release the session. In reaction to the receipt of
   the CANCEL request, the server MUST send a CANCEL request too. If no
   CANCEL request is received, the expiration time cancels the session
   at server side.

4.5.4.1. QoS Level increments without changes in network behaviour

   If the qos-level has not reached the maximum value (9) but after 3
   QOS-ALERT messages (with increments in qos-level) the network
   remains with the same quality values, the client and the server MUST
   assume that the network can not reach the desired quality and abort
   the session in order to save resources (time and traffic). To do
   that, the client MUST send a CANCEL request and the server MUST
   react to it sending a CANCEL request too.

   If the client does not send a CANCEL request but a request using a
   different method, the server MUST react to it sending a CANCEL
   request.

   4.6. Continuity phase

   During the negotiation phase, latency, jitter, bandwidth and packet
   loss have been measured. During continuity phase bandwidth will not
   be measured again because bandwidth measurements may disturb
   application performance.

   This phase is supposed to be executed at the same time as the real
   time application is being used.

   In the default measurement procedure, two working modes are defined
   for this phase: normal and sliding window modes. This draft only
   covers the default procedure.



          4.6.1.1. Normal mode

   The server can force the use of normal mode by setting the fourth
   parameter of "procedure" SDP attribute to 0. If this parameter is
   not set, the default value is assumed (zero), and normal mode will
   be used.

   Example:

       a=measurement:procedure default,50/50,50/50,5000,0

   Considering that network conditions can change, the client may
   periodically check network conditions against negotiated
   constraints. The maximum interval expected between network testing
   is indicated in the Q4S Expires header.

   However, the measurements can be carried out periodically in a
   smaller period of time than "Expires" header value. Intense
   interactive applications, like arcade videogames, the period to
   repeat the measurements may be very small (even zero), in order to
   measure continuously the quality and assure the best reaction time.
   To reach the best reaction time, the use of the sliding window mode
   is recommended.

   To start the continuity phase, the client sends a Q4S READY method,
   using the TCP control port specified in the handshake phase,
   indicating the new Stage header value for continuity phase (value
   2).

   After these messages are exchanged, latency, jitter and packet loss
   measurement are started. The measurement procedure is identical to
   the one carried out in the negotiation phase and is explained in the
   Measurements section 3.2, except for the time elapsed between
   salmples. If the default measurement method is being used, it is
   recommended to use a larger interval for PING messages than the one
   used in the negotiation phase, but the same number of samples will
   be taken to check quality. The goal of incrementing the interval of
   PING messages is to minimize the load of the server, which would be
   running lots of connections in parallel.

   The interval used for this phase is indicated in the second
   parameter of the attribute line for the procedure. In this example,
   the interval is 75 milliseconds.

   a=measurement:procedure default,50/50,75/75,5000,0


   A value larger than the one used in the negotiation phase is
   recommended.

          4.6.1.2. Sliding window mode

   In order to improve the reaction time when network conditions
   degrade quickly, the server can force the use of the sliding window
   mode by setting the fourth parameter of the "procedure" SDP
   attribute to 1.

   Example:

       a=measurement:procedure default,50/50,50/50,5000,1

   The sliding window mode applies a sliding window of samples instead
   cycles of samples. The number of samples involved in the sliding
   window may be different for jitter and latency calculations than for
   packet-loss calculations according to the fifth and sixth parameters
   of the measurement attribute. In this example, the jitter and
   latency sliding window comprises 40 samples whereas the size of the
   packet-loss sliding window is 100 samples:

   a=measurement:procedure default,50/50,75/75,5000,1,40/40,100/100

   In addition, the sizes of these windows are configurable per
   direction.

   In the sliding window mode, PING requests are sent continuously (in
   both directions) and when the Sequence-Number header reaches the
   value of 255, the client MUST NOT send a GET message for
   instructions, but continues sending PING messages with the Sequence-
   Number header starting again at zero. When the server PING Sequence-
   Number header reaches 255, it does the same, starting again from
   zero.

   On the client side, the measured values of downlink jitter, downlink
   packet loss and latency are calculated using the last samples,
   discarding older ones, in a sliding window schema.

   Only when the client detects that the measured values (downlink
   jitter, downlink packet loss and latency) are not reaching the
   constraints, a GET request is sent to the server.

   When the server receives the GET request, it stops sending PING
   requests and answers the GET request just received. If the response
   code is 412, then a QOS-ALERT will be requested by the client,
   exactly in the same way as described in normal mode.

   On the other hand, if the server detects that the measured values
   (uplink jitter, uplink packet loss and latency) are not reaching the
   constraints, it MUST choose between the following alternatives:

      o The server stops sending PING request to the client. In this
         case the client MUST notice this lack of PING requests using a
         timeout (Expire header) at reception. If so, the client reacts
         stopping the PING requests to the server and sending a GET
         request for instructions, exactly in the same way as described
         in normal mode.

      o It continues sending PING requests but all of them with
         Sequence-Number set to -1 till a client GET request is
         received. Then the server stops sending PING messages and
         answers the GET request with the corresponding 412 error,
         exactly in the same way as described in normal mode. The client
         reacts sending this GET request when it receives a PING request
         with Sequence-Number header set to -1. This behavior allows the
         shortest reaction time under degraded network conditions.

   Both alternatives MUST be implemented by the Q4S client.

   In Sliding-window mode, the optional header "measurements" of the
   PING message may be quite useful, because it allows the server to
   obtain all measurements without needing to receive a GET message
   from client. In this mode, the server may raise alerts directly,
   independently of which direction didn't meet a quality constraint,
   and send them to a policy server without client intervention.

   To avoid further alerts from the client, the SDP message sent by
   server to client may have high thresholds. The following diagram
   represents this scenario

   4.7. Termination Phase

   The Termination phase is not a phase itself but an end point for the
   established Q4S session. This phase is reached in the following
   cases:

      .  A Cancel message has been received. The client sends a Cancel
        message due to the impossibility of the network to meet the
        required quality constraints. The application has stopped
        running and alerts the server about its termination so that the
        server can terminate the Q4S session.

      .  Session expires: if after the Expires time no client or server
        activity is detected, that end cancels the session.

      .  A BEGIN message has been received by the server. The pre-
        existing Q4S quality session is cancelled and a new session
        will be initiated.

   The meaning of Termination phase in terms of release of resources or
   accounting is application dependent and out of scope of the Q4S
   protocol.

   4.8. Dynamic constraints and flows

   Depending on the nature of the application, the constraints to be
   reached may evolve, changing some or all constraint values in any
   direction.

   The client MUST be able to deal with this possibility. When the
   server sends an SDP document attached to a reply (200 OK, or 412,
   etc), the client MUST assume all the new received values, overriding
   any previous value in use.

   The dynamic changes on the constraints can be as a result of two
   possibilities:

      o The application communicates to the Q4S a change in the
         constraints. In this case the application requirements can
         evolve and the Q4S server will be aware of them.

      o The application uses TCP flows. In that case, in order to
         guarantee a constant throughput, the nature of TCP behavior
         forces the use of a composite constraint function, which
         depends on RTT, packet loss and window control mechanism
         implemented in each TCP stack.

   TCP throughput can be less than actual bandwidth if the
   Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) is large or if the network suffers
   from a high packet loss rate. In both cases, TCP congestion control
   algorithms may result in a suboptimal performance.

   Different TCP congestion control implementations like Reno [14],
   High Speed TCP (RFC 3649 [15]), CUBIC [16], Compound TCP (CTCP
   [17]), etc. reach different throughputs under the same network
   conditions of RTT and packet loss. In all cases, depending on the
   RTT measured value, the Q4S server could change dynamically the
   packetloss constraints (defined in SDP) in order to make possible to
   reach a required throughput or viceversa (use packetloss measurement
   to change dynamically latency constraints).

   A general guideline to calculate the packetloss constraint and RTT
   constraint consists in approximating the throughput using a
   simplified formula, which should take into account the TCP stack
   implementation of the receiver, in addition to RTT and packet loss:

             Th= Function( RTT, packet loss, ...)

   Then, depending on RTT measured values, set dynamically the
   packetloss constraint.

   It is possible to easily calculate a worst-case boundary for the
   Reno algorithm which should ensure for all algorithms that the
   target throughput is actually achieved. Except that, high-speed
   algorithms will then have even a larger throughput, if more
   bandwidth is available.

Internet-Draft    The Quality for Services Protocol          June 2011


   For the Reno algorithm, the Mathis' formula may be used [15] for the
   upper bound on the throughput:

            Th <= (MSS/RTT)*(1 / sqrt{p})

   In absence of packet loss, a practical limit for the TCP throughput
   is the receiver_window_size divided by the round-trip time. However,
   if the TCP implementation uses a window scale option, this limit can
   reach the available bandwidth value.

   4.9. Qos-level downgrade operation

   During the continuity phase it might be desirable to downgrade the
   current qos-level SDP parameter.

   The strategy to carry out downgrades must include the possibility to
   exclude specific data flows from SDP dynamically. A Q4S client MUST
   allow this kind of SDP modifications by server.

   Periodically (every several minutes, depending on the
   implementation) the server could force a QOS-ALERT, in which the
   level is downgraded for control flows, excluding application data
   flows from the embedded SDP of that request. To set the new SDP, the
   server MUST include the modified SDP in the 412 error message.

   This mechanism allows to measure at lower levels of quality while
   application flows continue using a higher qos level value.

      o If the measurements in the lower level meet the constraints,
         then a new QOS-ALERT to this lower qos-level can be forced by
         the server, in which the SDP includes the application data
         flows in addition to control flows.

      o If the measurements in the lower level do not meet the
         constraints, then a new QOS-ALERT to the previous qos-level
         MUST be forced by the server, in which the SDP includes only
         the control flows.

   This mechanism avoids the risk of disturbing the application, while
   the measurements are being run in lower levels. However, this
   optimization of resources is optional, and MUST be used carefully.

   The chosen period to measure a lower qos level is implementation
   dependant. Therefore it is not included as a measurement procedure
   parameter. It is recommended to use a large value, such as 20
   minutes.

   4.10. Sanity check of Quality sessions

   A session may finish by several reasons (client shutdown, client
   CANCEL request, constraints not reached, etc), and any session
   finished MUST release the assigned resources.

   In order to release the assigned server resources for the session,
   the "Expires" header indicates the maximum interval of time that a
   client can wait to repeat the continuity phase (in normal mode).



5. Q4S messages

   Q4S is a text-based protocol and uses the UTF-8 charset (RFC 3629
   [11]). A Q4S message is either a request or a response.

   Both Request and Response messages use the basic format of Internet
   Message Format (RFC 5322 [12]). Both types of messages consist of a

   start-line, one or more header fields, an empty line indicating the
   end of the header fields, and an optional message-body.


         generic-message  =  start-line
                             *message-header
                             CRLF
                             [ message-body ]
         start-line       =  Request-Line / Status-Line

   The start-line, each message-header line, and the empty line MUST be
   terminated by a carriage-return line-feed sequence (CRLF).  Note
   that the empty line MUST be present even if the message-body is not.

      Much of Q4S's messages and header field syntax are identical to
   HTTP/1.1. However, Q4S is not an extension of HTTP.



   5.1. Requests

   Q4S requests are distinguished by having a Request-Line for a start-
   line. A Request-Line contains a method name, a Request-URI, and the
   protocol version separated by a single space (SP) character.

   The Request-Line ends with CRLF. No CR or LF are allowed except in
   the end-of-line CRLF sequence. No linear whitespace (LWS) is allowed
   in any of the elements.

         Request-Line  =  Method SP Request-URI SP Q4S-Version CRLF

    Method: This specification defines five methods: GET for getting
          information and sending quality reports, PING and DATA for
          quality measurements purpose, CANCEL for terminating
          sessions, and QOS-ALERT for querying ISPs for quality
          upgrades.

    Request-URI: The Request-URI is a Q4S URI (RFC 2396) as described in
          2.2.1 It Normally indicates the user or service to which this
          request is being addressed to, but in the Q4S context, there
          are some methods whose URI only reflects the service on the
          server side, but nothing more. This is the case of the QOS-
          ALERT method, because the real address of a QoS upgrade



Garcia Aranda         Expires December 27, 2011              [Page 55]

Internet-Draft    The Quality for Services Protocol          June 2011


          request is the network, and therefore in this case the URI
          only reflects the server address. In addition the CANCEL
          method has the same treatment, and in the ECHO and DATA
          methods invoked by the server to the client the meaning of
          the URI is only the URI of the service, but not the
          destination of the request. The Request-URI MUST NOT contain
          unescaped spaces or control characters and MUST NOT be
          enclosed in "<>".

    Q4S-Version: Both request and response messages include the version
          of Q4S in use. To be compliant with this specification,
          applications sending Q4S messages MUST include a Q4S-Version
          of "Q4S/1.0".  The Q4S-Version string is case-insensitive,
          but implementations MUST send upper-case. Unlike HTTP/1.1,
          Q4S treats the version number as a literal string.  In
          practice, this should make no difference.

   5.2. Responses

   Q4S responses are distinguished from requests by having a Status-
   Line as their start-line. A Status-Line consists of the protocol
   version followed by a numeric Status-Code and its associated textual
   phrase, with each element separated by a single SP character. No CR
   or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.

     Status-Line  =  Q4S-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF

   The Status-Code is a 3-digit integer result code that indicates the
   outcome of an attempt to understand and satisfy a request. The
   Reason-Phrase is intended to give a short textual description of the
   Status-Code.  The Status-Code is intended for use by automata,
   whereas the Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. A client
   is not required to examine or display the Reason-Phrase.

   While this specification suggests specific wording for the reason
   phrase, implementations MAY choose other text, for example, in the
   language indicated in the Accept-Language header field of the
   request.

   The first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response.
   The last two digits do not have any categorization role.  For this
   reason, any response with a status code between 100 and 199 is
   referred to as a "1xx response", any response with a status code
   between 200 and 299 as a "2xx response", and so on.  Q4S/1.0 allows
   following values for the first digit:


Garcia Aranda         Expires December 27, 2011              [Page 56]

Internet-Draft    The Quality for Services Protocol          June 2011


         1xx: Provisional -- request received, continuing to process
   the request;

         2xx: Success -- the action was successfully received,
              understood, and accepted;

         3xx: Redirection -- further action needs to be taken in order
              to complete the request;

         4xx: Request Failure -- the request contains bad syntax or
           cannot be fulfilled at this server;

         5xx: Server Error -- the server failed to fulfill an
              apparently valid request;

         6xx: Global Failure -- the request cannot be fulfilled at any
              server.

   The status codes are the same described in HTTP (RFC 2616 [1]). In
   the same way as HTTP, Q4S applications are not required to
   understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
   understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST
   understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
   digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to
   the x00 status code of that class.

   The Q4S-ALERT and CANCEL requests do not have to be responded.

   5.3. Header Fields

   Q4S header fields are identical to HTTP header fields in both syntax
   and semantics.

   Some header fields only make sense in requests or responses. These
   are called request header fields and response header fields,
   respectively.  If a header field appears in a message not matching
   its category (such as a request header field in a response), it MUST
   be ignored.

      5.3.1. Specific Q4S Request Header Fields

   In addition to HTTP header fields, these are the specific Q4S
   request header fields

      o Session-Id: the value for this header is the same session id
         used in SDP and is assigned by the server. The messages without
         SDP MUST include this header. If a message has and SDP body,
         this header is optional. The method of <session id> allocation
         is up to the creating tool, but it is suggested that a UTC
         timestamp be used to ensure uniqueness.

      o Sequence-Number: sequential integer number assigned to PING and
         DATA messages.

      o Timestamp: this optional header contains the system time (with
         the best possible accuracy). Indicates the time in which the
         request was sent.

      o Signature: this header contains a digital signature that can be
         used by the network to validate the SDP. The signature is
         always generated by the server. It is optional.

      o Q4S-Resource-Client: this optional header contains the relative
         URI in charge of this session at the client side. In The case
         of being included, it MUST appear in the GET request of
         handshake phase. This URI MUST be invoked by the server in all
         later requests. It is optional, but it should be present, it
         becomes mandatory for the counterpart. This URI MUST be
         relative because user agents can not have associated domain, in
         addition to ignore their public IP address.


      5.3.2. Specific Q4S Response Header Fields

      o Expires: the purpose is to provide a sanity check and allow the
         server to close inactive sessions. If the client does not send
         a new request before the expiration time, the server can close
         the session. The value MUST be an integer and the measurement
         unit are milliseconds.

      o Guard-time: A time interval in milliseconds left vacant (i.e.,
         during which no data is sent) during the quality session. The
         guard time provides a safety margin before re-starting each
         measurement process when a QOS-ALERT has been raised. This
         header is optional in all messages but mandatory in the QOS-
         ALERT sent by the server.

      o Sequence-Number: same meaning as Request Header Fields

      o Timestamp: UTC time in nanoseconds. Indicates the time in which
         the request was sent. If the server (or a client) receives a
         Timestamp header in a request, MUST include the same header
         with the same value in the response. The purpose of this header
         is simplify the RTT calculation.

      o Signature: same meaning as Request Header Fields

      o Q4S-Resource-Server: this optional header contains the URI in
         charge of this session (Session URI). In case of being
         included, it MUST appear in the response to the BEGIN request
         of the handshake phase. This URI MUST be invoked by the client
         in all later requests. It is optional, but if present, it
         becomes mandatory for the counterpart.

      o Q4S-Policy-Server: this optional header contains the URI
         towards which the client and MUST send the QOS-ALERT messages
         (Policy Server URI). In case this header is present, the Q4S-
         Resource-Server header is mandatory, and MUST be included in
         the QOS-ALERT messages sent by the client to the policy server.
         In addition, the QOS-ALERT sent to the policy server MUST
         contain the header Q4S-Resource-client

      o Cause: This header field is a comma-separated list which
         contains the cause(s) for which the connection constraints were
         not reached after measurement process. Current defined values
         are:

               . Downlink_latency

               . Uplink_latency

               . Downlink_jitter

               . Uplink_jitter

               . Downlink_bw

               . Uplink_bw



   5.4. Bodies

     Requests, including new requests defined in extensions to this
   specification, MAY contain message bodies unless otherwise noted.
   The interpretation of the body depends on the request method.

Internet-Draft    The Quality for Services Protocol          June 2011


   For response messages, the request method and the response status
   code determine the type and interpretation of any message body.  All
   responses MAY include a body.

   The Internet media type of the message body MUST be given by the
   Content-Type header field.

      5.4.1. Encoding

      The body MUST NOT be compressed. This mechanism is valid for
   other protocols such as HTTP and SIP (RFC 3261 [13]), but
   a compression/coding scheme will limit certain logical
   implementations of the way the request is parsed, thus, making the
   protocol concept more implementation dependant. In addition,
   bandwidth calculation may not be valid if compression is used.
   Therefore, the HTTP request header "Accept-Encoding" can not be used
   in Q4S with different values than "identity" and if it is present in
   a request, the server MUST ignore it. In addition, the response
   header "Content-Encoding" is optional, but if present, the unique
   permitted value is "identity".

   The body length in bytes is provided by the Content-Length header
   field. The "chunked" transfer encoding of HTTP/1.1 MUST NOT be used
   for Q4S (Note: The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message
   in order to transfer it as a series of chunks, each one with its own
   size indicator.)


6. General User Agent behavior.

   6.1. Roles

   In order to allow peer to peer applications, a Q4S User Agent (UA)
   MUST be able to assume both client and server role. The role assumed
   depends on who sends the first message.

   In a communication between two UAs, the UA that sends the Q4S BEGIN
   request in the first place, for starting the handshake phase, shall
   assume the client role.

   If both UASs send the BEGIN request at the same time, they will wait
   for a random time to restart again.

   Otherwise, an UA may be configured to act only as server (e.g.,
   content provider's side).

   6.2. Multiple Quality sessions in parallel

   A quality session is intended to be used for a single application
   (or application instance). It means that for using the application,
   the client MUST establish only one quality session against the
   server. Indeed, the relation between Session-Id and application is 1
   to 1.

   If a user wants to raise several independent quality sessions
   simultaneously against different servers (or against the same
   server) it can execute multiple Q4S clients to establish separate
   quality sessions. However, this is not recommended because:

      o The establishment of a new quality session may affect other
         running applications over other quality sessions. Thus, minimum
         quality level may not be achieved depending on individual
         requirements of each application.

      o If the negotiation phase is executed separately before running
         any application, the quality requirements could not be assured
         when the applications are running in parallel.

      o Flow identification (Protocol, SourceIP, Source Port +
         Destination IP, Destination Port) must always be unique for
         each application/application instance, to ensure that each one
         of them is using their QoS constraints.

   For running different applications in parallel it is highly
   recommended to execute the negotiation phase of all of them
   simultaneously, in order to assure the quality constraints of all
   applications in parallel. To do that, a single User Agent MUST be
   used, and this User Agent MUST be able to launch several quality

   session negotiations in parallel, synchronizing the beginning of
   each negotiation phase, and running again the negotiation phase of
   all applications in parallel until all of them succeed.

   In order to repeat the execution of a negotiation phase that has
   been succeeded, both, client and server MUST allow using the READY
   method with a Stage header value already succeeded.

   6.3. General client behavior

   A Q4S Client has different behaviors. We will use letters X,Y,Z to
   designate each different behavior (follow the letter bullets in the
   figure below).

      X) When it sends messages over TCP (methods GET, QOS-ALERT and
      CANCEL) it behaves strictly like a state machine that sends
      requests and waits for responses. Depending on the response type
      it enters in a new state.

   When it sends UDP messages (methods PING and DATA), a Q4S client is
   not strictly a state machine that sends messages and waits for
   responses because:


      Y) At latency, jitter and packet loss measurement, the PING
      requests are sent periodically, not after receiving the response
      to the previous request. In addition, the client MUST answer the
      PING requests coming from the server, therefore assumes the role
      of a server.

      Z) At bandwidth and packet loss measurement stage, the client does
      not expect to receive responses when sending DATA requests to the
      server. In addition, it MUST receive and process all server
      messages in order to achieve the downlink measurement.

   The QOS-ALERT and CANCEL do not need to be answered. However, these
   methods may have a conventional answer if an error is produced.

      6.3.1. Generating requests

   A valid Q4S request formulated by a Client MUST, at a minimum,
   contain the following header fields:

   If no SDP is included: This is the case of PING and DATA messages.
   The header Session-Id and Sequence-Number are mandatory.

   If SDP is included: this is the case of GET, QOS-ALERT and CANCEL
   messages. Inside SDP is included Session-Id, therefore the inclusion
   of Session-Id header is optional.

   6.4. General server behavior

   If a server does not understand a header field in a request (that
   is,   the header field is not defined in this specification or in
   any supported extension), the server MUST ignore that header field
   and continue processing the message.

   The role of the server is changed at negotiation and continuity
   phases, in which server MUST send packets to measure jitter, latency
   and bandwidth. Therefore, the different behaviors of server are
   (follow the letter bullets in the figure below):

      R) When the client sends messages over TCP (methods GET, QOS-
      ALERT and CANCEL) it behaves strictly like a state machine that
      receives messages and sends responses.

   When the client begins to send UDP messages (methods PING and DATA),
   a Q4S server is not strictly a state machine that receives messages
   and sends responses because:

      S) At latency, jitter and packet loss measurement, the PING
      requests are sent periodically by the client but also by the
      server. In this case the server behaves as a server answering
      client requests but also behaves as a client, sending PING
      requests toward the client and receiving responses.

      T) At bandwidth and packet loss measurement, the server sends
      DATA requests to the client. In addition, it MUST receive and
      process client messages in order to achieve the uplink
      measurement.

   The QOS-ALERT and CANCEL do not need to be answered. However, these
   methods may have a conventional answer if an error is produced.

7. Q4S method definitions

   The Method token indicates the method to be performed on the
   resource identified by the Request-URI. The method is case-
   sensitive.








Garcia Aranda         Expires December 27, 2011              [Page 64]

Internet-Draft    The Quality for Services Protocol          June 2011


          Method  = "BEGIN" | "GET" | "READY" | "PING" | "DATA" |
                    "QOS-ALERT" | "CANCEL" | extension-method

          extension-method = token

   The list of methods allowed by a resource can be specified in an
   "Allow" header field (RFC 2616 [1] section 14.7). The return code of
   the response always notifies the client when a method is currently
   allowed on a resource, since the set of allowed methods can change
   dynamically. Any server application SHOULD return the status code
   405 (Method Not Allowed) if the method is known, but not allowed for
   the requested resource, and 501 (Not Implemented) if the method is
   unrecognized or not implemented by the server.

   7.1. BEGIN

   The BEGIN method means request information from a resource
   identified by a Q4S URI. The semantics of this method is the
   starting of a quality session.

   This method is only used during the handshake phase to retrieve the
   SDP containing all quality parameters for the desired application to
   run.

   When a BEGIN message is received by the server, any current quality
   session is cancelled and a new session should be created.

   The response to a Q4S BEGIN request is not cacheable.

   7.2. GET

   The GET method means retrieve information from a resource identified
   by a Q4S URI.

   In the negotiation and continuity phases, this method is used to
   check if the server considers the quality good enough to execute the
   desired application. If the measured quality is not enough, the
   server will return a 412 error.

   The response to a Q4S GET request is not cacheable.

   7.3. READY

   The READY method is used to synchronize the starting time for
   sending of PING and DATA messages over UDP between clients and
   servers.

   In addition, the Stage header included in this method is mandatory
   and allows clients to repeat a test, which is needed in scenarios
   with multiple quality sessions between one client and different
   servers.

   This message is only used in negotiation and continuity phases, and
   only just before making a measurement. Otherwise (out of this
   context), the server MUST ignore this method.

   7.4. PING

   This message is used during the negotiation and continuity phases to
   measure the RTT and jitter of a session. The message MUST be sent
   only over UDP control port. If a server receives this message in
   another port it MUST ignore it.

   The fundamental difference between the PING and DATA requests is
   reflected in the different measurements achieved with them. PING is
   a short message, and MUST be answered in order to measure RTT,
   whereas DATA is a long message (1 Kbyte) and MUST NOT be answered.

   PING is a request method that can be originated by client but also
   by server. Client MUST answer the server PINGs, assuming a "server
   role" for these messages during measurement process.

   7.5. DATA

   This message is used only during the continuity phase to measure the
   bandwidth and packet loss of a session. The message MUST be sent
   only over UDP control port. If a server receives this message in
   other port it MUST ignore it.

   The fundamental difference between the PING and DATA requests is
   reflected in the different measurements achieved with them. PING is
   a short message, and MUST be answered in order to measure RTT,
   whereas DATA is a long message (1 Kbyte) and MUST NOT be answered.

   DATA is a request method that can be originated by the client but
   also by server. Both (client and server) MUST NOT answer DATA
   messages.

   7.6. QOS-ALERT

   This is the request message that Q4S generates when the measurements
   indicate that quality SLA is being violated. It is used during the
   negotiation and continuity phases.

   This informative message indicates that the user experience is being
   degraded and includes the details of the problem (bandwidth, jitter,
   packet loss measurements and the SLA). The QOS-ALERT message does
   not contain any detail on the actions to be taken, which depends on
   the agreements between all involved parties.

   A QOS-ALERT request does not have to be answered unless there is an
   error condition. However, after receiving a QOS-ALERT request, the
   server sends a QOS-ALERT request to the client.

   This method can be initiated by the client only after a 412 error
   coming from server, and with enough information to build the
   QOS-ALERT message.

   If the "Q4S-Policy-Server" header was included in the server
   response of the handshake phase, the QOS-ALERT message MUST be sent
   to the URI indicated in this header, otherwise the QOS-ALERT message
   MUST be sent to the server.

   With policy server, the QOS-ALERT message sent by the client MUST
   contain the URIs of the server and the client to be contacted later
   by the policy server. Therefore the following headers MUST be
   included in the client request: "Q4S-Resource-Server" and "Q4S-
   Resource-Client".

   The response to a Q4S QOS-ALERT request is not cacheable.

   7.7. CANCEL

   Like QOS-ALERT, this message is used for communication with the
   network resources. The semantics in this case is the release of the
   special resources assigned to the session.

   In the same way as QOS-ALERT, CANCEL does not need to be answered.
   However, if the server receives a CANCEL message, it should send a
   new CANCEL request towards the client acknowledging the reception.

8. Response codes

   Q4S response codes are used for TCP and UDP. However, in UDP only
   the response code 200 is used.

   8.1. 100 Trying

   This response indicates that the request has been received by the
   next-hop server (the policy server) and that some unspecified action
   is being taken on behalf of this request (for example, a database is
   being consulted). This response, like all other provisional
   responses, stops retransmissions of a QOS-ALERT by the client.

   8.2. 200 OK

   The request has succeeded.

   8.3. Redirection 3xx

   3xx responses give information about the user's new location, or
   about alternative services that might be able to satisfy the
   request.

   The requesting client SHOULD retry the request at the new
   address(es) given by the Location header field.

   8.4. Request Failure 4xx

   4xx responses are definite failure responses from a particular
   server. The client SHOULD NOT retry the same request without
   modification (for example, adding appropriate headers or SDP
   values). However, the same request to a different server might be
   successful.

      8.4.1. 400 Bad Request

   The request could not be understood due to malformed syntax. The
   Reason-Phrase SHOULD identify the syntax problem in more detail, for
   example, "Missing Sequence-Number header field".

      8.4.2. 404 Not Found

   The server has definitive information that the user does not exist
   at the domain specified in the Request-URI. This status is also
   returned if the domain in the Request-URI does not match any of the
   domains handled by the recipient of the request.

      8.4.3. 405 Method Not Allowed

   The method specified in the Request-Line is understood, but not
   allowed for the address identified by the Request-URI.

   The response MUST include an Allow header field containing a list of
   valid methods for the indicated address.

      8.4.4. 406 Not Acceptable

   The resource identified by the request is only able of generating
   response entities that have content characteristics not acceptable
   according to the Accept header field sent in the request.

      8.4.5. 408 Request Timeout

   The server could not produce a response within a suitable amount of
   time, and the client MAY repeat the request without modifications at
   any later time

      8.4.6. 412 A precondition has not been met

   The server is indicating that the SLA is being violated.

      8.4.7. 413 Request Entity Too Large

   The server is refusing to process a request because the request
   entity-body is larger than the one that the server is willing or
   able to process. The server MAY close the connection to prevent the
   client from continuing the request.

      8.4.8. 414 Request-URI Too Long

   The server is refusing to process the request because the Request-
   URI is longer than the one that the server accepts.

      8.4.9. 415 Unsupported Media Type

   The server is refusing to process the request because the message
   body of the request is in a format not supported by the server for
   the requested method. The server MUST return a list of acceptable
   formats using the Accept, Accept-Encoding, or Accept-Language header
   field, depending on the specific problem with the content.

      8.4.10. 416 Unsupported URI Scheme

   The server cannot process the request because the scheme of the URI
   in the Request-URI is unknown to the server.

   8.5. Server Failure 5xx

   5xx responses are failure responses given when a server itself is
   having trouble.

      8.5.1. 500 Server Internal Error

   The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it
   from fulfilling the request. The client MAY display the specific
   error condition and MAY retry the request after several seconds.

      8.5.2. 501 Not Implemented

   The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill
   the request. This is the appropriate response when a Server does not
   recognize the request method and it is not capable of supporting it
   for any user.

   Note that a 405 (Method Not Allowed) is sent when the server
   recognizes the request method, but that method is not allowed or
   supported.

      8.5.3. 503 Service Unavailable

   The server is temporarily unable to process the request due to a
   temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The server MAY
   indicate when the client should retry the request in a Retry-After
   header field. If no Retry-After is given, the client MUST act as if
   it had received a 500 (Server Internal Error) response.

   A client receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) SHOULD attempt to
   forward the request to an alternate server. It SHOULD NOT forward
   any other requests to that server for the duration specified in the
   Retry-After header field, if present.

   Servers MAY refuse the connection or drop the request instead of
   responding with 503 (Service Unavailable).

      8.5.4. 504 Server Time-out

   The server did not receive a timely response from an external server
   it accessed in attempting to process the request.

      8.5.5. 505 Version Not Supported

   The server does not support, or refuses to support, the Q4S protocol
   version that was used in the request. The server is indicating that
   it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same
   major version as the client, other than with this error message.

      8.5.6. 513 Message Too Large

   The server was unable to process the request since the message
   length exceeded its capabilities.

   8.6. Global Failures 6xx

   6xx responses indicate that a server has definitive information
   about a particular policy not satisfied for processing the request.

      8.6.1. 600 session not exist

   The Session-Id is not valid

      8.6.2. 601 quality level not allowed

   The QOS level requested is not allowed for the pair client/server

      8.6.3. 603 Session not allowed

   The session is not allowed due to some policy (number of sessions
   allowed for the server is exceeded, or the time band of the QOS-
   ALERT is not allowed for the pair client/server, etc)

      8.6.4. 604 authorization not allowed

   The policy server does not authorize the QOS-ALERT operation because
   any internal or external reason.


9. Implementation Recommendations

   9.1. Default client constraints

   To provide a default configuration, it would be good that the client
   had a configurable set of Quality headers in the browser settings
   menu. Otherwise these quality headers will not be present in the
   first message.

   Different business models (out of scope of this proposal) may be
   achieved: depending on who pays for the quality session, the server
   can accept certain Client parameters sent in the first message, or
   force billing parameters on the server side.

   9.2. Bandwidth measurements

   In programming languages or Operating Systems with timers or limited
   clock resolution, it is recommended to use an approach based on
   several intervals to send messages of 1KB, in order to reach the
   required bandwidth consumption using a rate as close as possible to
   a constant rate.

   For example, if the resolution is 1 millisecond, and the bandwidth
   to reach is 11Mbps, a good approach consists of sending:

     1 message of 1KB every 1 millisecond +

     1 message of 1KB every 3 milliseconds +

     1 message of 1KB every 23 milliseconds

   The number of intervals depends on required bandwidth and accuracy
   that the programmer wants to achieve.

   9.3. Packet loss measurement resolution

   Depending on application nature and network conditions, a packet
   loss resolution less than 1% may be needed. In such case, there is
   no limit to the number of samples used for this calculation. A
   tradeoff between time and resolution should be reached in each case.
   For example, in order to have a resolution of 1/10000, the last
   10000 samples should be considered in the packetloss measured value.

   The problem of this approach is the reliability of old samples. If
   the interval used between PING messages is 50ms, then to have a
   resolution of 1/1000 it takes 50 seconds and a resolution of 1/10000
   takes 500 seconds (more than 8 minutes). The reliability of a packet
   loss calculation based on a sliding window of 8 minutes depends on
   how fast network conditions evolve.

   9.4. Measurements and reactions

   Q4S can be used as a mechanism for measure and trigger actions (i.e.
   lowering video bit-rate) in real-time in order to reach the
   application constraints, addressing measured possible network
   degradation.

   The trigger is based on message QOS-ALERT, which is always forced by
   the server response 412 error. A server can avoid these QOS-REQUEST
   messages sending 200 OK when a GET message is received from server,
   independently whether the constraints are met or not.



   9.5. Instability treatments

   There are two scenarios in which Q4S can be affected by network
   problems: loss of control packets and outlier samples



   9.5.1. Loss of control packets

   Lost UDP packets (PING or DATA messages) don't cause any problems
   for the Q4S state machine, but if control packets like READY, 200
   OK, 412 error, or GET messages are lost, some undesirable
   consequences could arise.

   Q4S does have protection mechanisms to overcome these situations.
   Examples:

      .  If a READY packet is lost, after a certain timeout, the client
        SHOULD resend another READY packet.

      .  If the server's expected 200 OK answer to the client's READY
        message is lost, but PING packets begin to arrive, we assume
        that the initial received PING packet is enough and the client
        SHOULD start sending PING messages.

      .  If a GET packet is lost, the client will not receive any
        response by the server. After a certain timeout, the client
        SHOULD resend another GET message.

      .  If the 412 error message is lost, the server will receive a
        resent GET message instead a QoS-REQUEST message.



   9.5.2. Outlier samples

   Outlier samples are those jitter or latency values far from the
   general/average values of most samples.

   In order to get rid of some outlier samples, that due to a bad
   spurious sample or an error on a measurement. The recommendation is
   to implement a median one dimension filter. This is a very common
   filtering for noise or errors on signal and image processing.

   This is a very simple algorithm, where we keep a small window of
   previous measurements. We recommend a small window of 5 to 10
   values. The new value is to get the median from the sorted tuple of
   window stored values.

   This small window is not the same as the window used for calculating
   the average latency or jitter, but a simple mechanism to add a new
   (and more reliable) sample to the list.

   9.6. Scenarios

   Q4S could be used in two scenarios:

      o client to ACP (Application content provider)

      o client to client.



      9.6.1. Client to ACP

   In this scenario, the policy server is optional. If it exists, the
   QOS-ALERT messages MUST be sent to this policy server which acts as
   a proxy for this type of messages and validates them (plus any other
   actions out of scope of this document).

   In order to avoid useless load on the server, the policy server
   could receive the BEGIN messages of handshake phase. For this
   purpose, the policy server MUST know the URI of the Q4S servers.

   In this scenario a client could send the BEGIN to the policy server,
   with an additional parameter in the URI requested, which identifies
   the server, like:

   Q4s://www.policy.com/listofservers?id=xtiwn28821ho4

   Then the Policy Server validates the request and forward the BEGIN
   to the Q4S server, adding the Q4S-Resource-Server to the response
   for the client in the 200 OK response.

   In this scenario the client MUST send further messages directly to
   the server without passing through policy server.

   There is a possible scenario in which the policy server is contacted
   only by the Q4S server, enabled through the reception of the client
   measurements in PING messages that include the "measurements"
   header. In this case, the QOS-ALERT message does not cause an
   interruption of the sliding-window during continuity phase.

      9.6.2. Client to client

   In order to solve the client to client scenario, a Q4S register
   function MUST be implemented. This allows clients contact each other
   for sending the BEGIN message. In this scenario, the Register server
   would be used by peers to publish their Q4S-Resource-Server header

   and their public IP address to make possible the assumption of
   server role.

   The register function is out of scope of this protocol version,
   because different HTTP mechanisms can be used and Q4S MUST NOT force
   any.

10. Security Considerations

   Different types of attacks can be avoided:

          o Spoofing of server IP address can be avoided using the
             digital signature mechanism. The network can easily
             validate this digital signature using the public key of the
             server certificate.

          o The client could try to send QOS-ALERT requests constantly,
             trying to enter in the negotiation phase continuously. In
             this case, the server MUST answer a message "CANCEL", in
             order to release the all levels reached and return to plain
             access without enhanced quality.

   This protocol could be supported over IPSec to increase privacy,
   although it is out of scope of this proposal.



11. IANA Considerations

   A specific port for Q4S TCP control flow mechanism could be
   assigned. It could simplify the network implementation. Other
   possibility is to use any other port (like 80, HTTP). In this case
   the network could use the protocol designator "Q4S" as the mark for
   distinguish and treat the packets.

   Q4S uses SDP as a container for session information, in which
   quality attributes have been added as extended "session-level"
   attributes. These set of new attributes should be registered (in
   order to avoid the prefix "X-"). In this document, this set of
   attributes has been presented as registered attributes.

   This is the list of attribute field names to register:

         "/".

      o The fourth parameter indicates the mode for continuity phase (0
         means "normal" and 1 means "sliding window"). In case of not be
         present, normal mode (default value of 0) will be assumed.

      o The fifth parameter is only applicable in sliding window mode.
         It indicates the window size for the jitter and latency
         calculation on both forward and reverse directions. If not
         present, a value of 256 MUST be assumed.

      o The sixth parameter is only applicable in sliding window mode.
         It indicates the window size for packet loss calculations on
         both forward and reverse directions. If not present, a value of
         256 MUST be assumed.



   Other procedure names are allowed, but at least "default" procedure
   implementation is mandatory in client and servers.

12. Conclusions

   Q4S defines four phases with different purposes, and inside these
   phases the negotiated measurement procedure is used. Different
   measurement procedures can be used (even RTCP itself) inside Q4S.
   Basically, Q4S only defines how to transport SLA information and
   measurement results as well as providing some mechanisms for
   alerting. Q4S does not ask for resources. Q4S only alerts if one (or
   some) of SLA quality parameters are being violated. Depends on
   server (Application content provider) to do something with this
   information and return it back to a SLA-compliant state.

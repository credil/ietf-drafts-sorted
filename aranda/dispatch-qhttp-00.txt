Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


Abstract

   This memo describes an application level protocol for the standard
   communication of e2e QoS compliance information using a protocol
   based on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis
   for the World Wide Web, and Session Description Protocol (SDP).
   Quality HTTP (Q-HTTP) provides a mechanism for latency, jitter,
   bandwidth an packet loss negotiation and monitoring, alerting
   whenever one of the negotiated conditions is violated.

   Implementation details on the actions to be triggered upon
   reception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are out
   of scope of this draft, it is application dependant (e.g. increase
   quality, reduce bit-rate) or even network dependant (e.g. change
   connection's quality profile).

1. Introduction

      The World Wide Web (WWW) is a distributed hypermedia system which
   has gained widespread acceptance among Internet users. Although WWW
   browsers support other, preexisting Internet application protocols,
   the native and primary protocol used between WWW clients and servers
   is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (RFC 2616 [1]).  The ease
   of use of the Web has prompted its widespread employment as a
   client/server architecture for many applications.  Many of such
   applications require the client and the server to be able to
   communicate each other and exchange information with certain quality
   constraints.

   Quality in communications at application level consists of four
   measurable parameters:

      o Latency: The time a message takes to travel from source to
         destination. It may be approximated to RTT/2 (Round trip time),
         assuming the networks are symmetrical.

      o Jitter: latency variation. There are some formulas to calculate
         Jitter, and in this context we will consider the statistical
         variance formula.

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


      o Bandwidth: To assure the quality, a protocol MUST assure the
         availability of bandwidth needed by the application.

      o Packet loss: The percentage of packet loss is closely related
         to bandwidth and jitter. Affects bandwidth because a high
         packet loss implies sometimes retransmissions that also
         consumes extra bandwidth, other times the retransmissions are
         not achieved ( for example in video streaming over UDP) and the
         information received is less than the required bandwidth. In
         terms of jitter, a packet loss sometimes is seen by the
         destination like a larger time between arrivals, causing a
         jitter growth.

   Q-HTTP provides a mechanism for quality monitoring and it is based on
   HTTP and SDP in order to be easily integrated in WWW, but it may be
   used by any type of application, not only those based on HTTP.
   Quality requirements may be needed by any type of application that
   communicates using any kind of protocol, especially those which have
   real-time constraints.

   Q-HTTP is an application level Client/Server protocol which pretends
   to measure continuously session quality for a given flow (or set of
   flows), end-to-end and in real-time; raising an alert if quality
   parameters are below a given threshold. The thresholds of each
   application are different, depending on the nature of each
   application. Q-HTTP does not describe either the actions carried out
   to deal with the alert or how to implement them.

   Q-HTTP is session-independent from the application flow/s, in order
   to not impact them. To perform the measurements, two control flows
   are created in each direction (forward and reverse).

   1.1. Motivation

   Monitoring quality of service (QoS) in computer networks is useful
   for several reasons:

      o Enable real-time services and applications to verify whether
         network resources achieve a certain QoS level.

      o Monitoring helps real-time services and applications to run on
         the cloud, allowing the existence of Application Content
         providers (ACPs) which offer guaranteed real-time services to
         the final users.

      o Monitoring also applies to Peer to Peer (P2P) real-time
         applications

      o Enable ISPs to offer QoS to any ACP or final user application
         in an accountable way

      o Enable e2e negotiation of QoS parameters, from any ISP to any
         ISP.

   A protocol to monitor QoS must address the following issues:

      o Must be ready to be used by current standard protocols and
         applications, without forcing a change on them.

      o Must have a formal and compact way to specify quality
         constraints of the desired application to run.

      o Must have measurement mechanisms avoiding application
         disruption.

      o Must have specific messages to alert about the violation of
         quality constraints in different directions (forward and
         reverse), because network routing may not be symmetrical, and
         of course, quality constraints may not be symmetrical.

      o Must Protect the data (constrains, measurements, QoS levels
         asked to the network) in order to avoid malicious measurements.



   1.2. Summary of Features

      Quality HTTP is a message-oriented communication protocol
   designed to be used in a similar way like HTTP (RFC 2616 [1]). Q-HTTP
   can be used in conjunction with HTTP too since it is designed to
   coexist with HTTP's messaging model and to be easily integrated with
   HTTP applications.

   It is based on HTTP and SDP (RFC 4566 [2]) for easy integration in
   WWW. The benefits in quality provided by Q-HTTP can be used by any
   type of application which uses any type of protocol for data
   transport. Quality HTTP provides a quality monitoring mechanism to
   any communication that takes place between the client and the server,
   not only the Q-HTTP communication itself.

   Q-HTTP does not establish multimedia sessions and it does not
   transport application data. The type of use and kind of protocol of
   this quality communication is application dependant and can be
   whatever. Q-HTTP doesn't force any particular protocol or way of
   using of the quality connection.

   Q-http defines three phases with different purposes, and inside these
   phases a negotiated measurement procedure is used. Different
   measurement procedures can be used inside Q-HTTP (although for
   compatibility reasons a default measurement mechanism is defined).
   Basically, Q-HTTP only defines how to transport SLA information and
   measurement results as well as providing some mechanisms for
   alerting.

   Q-HTTP MUST be executed just before starting a client-server
   application which needs a quality connection in terms of latency,
   jitter, bandwidth and packet loss. Once client and server have
   succeeded in establishing communication under quality constraints,
   the application can start, and Q-HTTP continues measuring and
   alerting.

   During the lifetime of the quality session, the protocol keeps in a
   special state in which it periodically renews the session and alerts
   if the measurements of quality parameters does not meet the
   negotiated application requirements.

   The quality parameters can be suggested by the client in the first
   message, but the server can accept these parameter values or force
   others. The server is in charge of deciding the final values of
   quality connection.



2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

3. Overview of Operation

      This section introduces the basic operations of Q-HTTP using
   simple examples.  This section is tutorial in nature and does not
   contain any normative statements.

   3.1. Protocol Phases

      All elements of the IP network contribute to the quality in terms
   of latency, jitter, bandwidth and packet loss. All this elements have
   their own quality policies in terms of priorities, traffic mode, etc.
   and each element has its own way to manage the quality. The purpose
   of a quality connection is to establish an end-to-end communication
   with enough quality for the server application.

   To monitor negotiated SLA compliance, three phases are defined

      o The handshake in which the server is contacted by the client
         and in the answer message it communicates the quality
         constraints for a given application.

      o The negotiation phase, in which the quality of the connection
         is measured in both directions (latency, jitter, bandwidth and
         packet loss), and Q-HTTP messages are sent in order to alert
         when the quality does not match the constraints. This phase is
         iterative until quality constraints are reached or the session
         is cancelled after checking that the quality constraints are
         impossible to reach. Just after reaching the quality
         requirements, Q-HTTP provides a simple mechanism to trigger
         optionally the application using HTTP.

      o The continuity phase, in which periodically, the quality is
         measured. If the quality measurement results become degraded, a
         new negotiation phase is started. In this phase the
         measurements MUST avoid disturbing application by consuming
         network resources.

      3.1.1. Handshake Phase

   The first phase consists of a Q-HTTP BEGIN message sent from the
   client to the server. This message goes through all elements
   belonging to one or more IP networks.

   The first Q-HTTP message MUST have a special URI (RFC 3986 [4]),
   which forces the use of Q-HTTP protocol if it is implemented in a
   general web browser. The http URI scheme MUST be:

         "httpq:" "//" host [":" port] [path["?" query]

   instead of the conventional http schema:

         "http:" "//" host [":" port] [path["?" query]]

   Optionally, the client can send the desired quality parameters (to do
   that, enclosed in the body of the message a SDP should be sent) and
   the server can take them into account when it builds the answer with
   the final values, following a offer / answer schema (RFC 3464 [5]).
   The description of these quality parameters is encoded in SDP.

   The server MUST answer with a Q-HTTP 200 OK message, and in the body
   of the answer message, a SDP MUST be included, with information of
   the required quality constraints. Q-HTTP responses should use the
   protocol designator "Q-HTTP/1.0".

   After these two messages are sent, the first phase is completed. The
   quality parameters have been sent to the client. Next step is to
   measure the quality of the communication path between client and
   server and alert if SLA is being violated.

   (SDP not shown)
   =========================


   The header "Expires" purpose is to provide a sanity check and enables
   the server to close inactive sessions. If the client does not send a
   new request before the expiration time, the server can close the
   session.

   The header "Signature" contains a digital signature that can be used
   by the network to validate the SDP, preventing security attacks.

   The signature is an optional header generated by the server using a
   hash and encryption method such as MD5 (RFC 1321 [6]) and RSA (RFC
   2437 [7]), but it depends on the certificate used by the server. This
   certificate is supposed to be delivered by a Certification Authority
   (CA) or policy owner to the server. The signature is applied to the
   SDP body.

       Signature= RSA ( MD5 (<sdp>),<certificate>)

   If the signature is not present, other validation mechanism may be
   implemented in order to provide assured quality with security and
   control.

   The optional response header "Q-HTTP-Resource-Server" contains the
   URI in charge of this session. This URI MUST be invoked by the client
   in all later requests. Example:

   Q-HTTP-Resource-
   server:httpq://www.example.com/example/util/agent?num=666

   If this header is not present, the client will continue sending all
   requests to the original invoked URI, but if it is present, its use
   is mandatory.

   The last optional response header is "Q-HTTP-policy-server" which
   contains the URI towards which client MUST send the later QOS-ALERT
   messages. This header will be explained later on. In case this header
   is present, the Q-HTTP-Resource-server header is mandatory.

   During the next phases of the protocol, the client role is not pure,
   but a mix of client and server. Hence, the client can specify a "Q-
   HTTP-Resource-client" header in the BEGIN request of handshake,
   indicating the relative URI in charge of the server requests when
   client acts as a server. Example:

   Q-HTTP-Resource-Client:/example/useragent

   This URI MUST be relative because user agents may not have an
   associated domain, in addition to unknown their public IP address.



   3.1.1.1. Description of Quality parameters inside SDP

   The original goal of SDP was designed to announce necessary
   information for the participants and multicast MBONE (Multicast
   Backbone) applications. Right now, its use has been extended to the
   announcement and the negotiation of multimedia sessions. The purpose
   of SDP in the Q-HTTP context is different because no media parameters
   are set, therefore the number of media attributes ("m") is always
   zero. This is because Q-HTTP purpose is not to establish media
   streams sessions, but monitor a good quality connection, and this
   quality connection can be used to establish media sessions by other
   protocols, or for any other purpose.

   The SDP embedded in the messages is the container of the quality
   parameters. The included information can comprise all or some of the
   following parameters, by means of optional session-level attributes:

      o QoS level for uplink and downlink: specified in the attribute
         "qos-level". Default values are 0 for both directions. The
         meaning of each level is out of scope of Q-HTTP, but, in
         general, a higher level should correspond to a better quality
         service.

      o Maximum latency tolerance for uplink and downlink: specified in
         the attribute "latency", expressed in milliseconds.

      o Maximum jitter tolerance for uplink and downlink: specified in
         the attribute "jitter", expressed in milliseconds.

      o Minimum bandwidth for uplink and downlink: specified in the
         attribute "bandwidth", expressed in kbps

      o Maximum packet loss tolerance for uplink and downlink:
         specified in the attribute  "packetloss" expressed in
         percentage

      o Flows of data over TCP and UDP ports to be used in uplink and
         downlink: specified in the attribute "flow"

      o Measurement procedure and results of quality measurements:
         specified in the attribute  "measurement"

   This is an example of SDP for Q-HTTP usage. For each attribute two
   values separated by "/" are involved. These values represent the
   uplink and downlink values : <uplink> / <downlink>. When one or both
   of these values are empty, it means that there is no constraint on
   this parameter.

   Inside the constraints, several "flow" attributes can be defined. The
   target is to monitor each flow to verify that the quality constraints
   are met. These flows include the type (uplink or downlink), the
   protocol (TCP or UDP) (RFC 761 [8] and RFC 768 [9]) and the ports
   that are going to be used by the application data and, of course, by

   the control (for quality measurements), because the quality
   measurements MUST be achieved over the same quality session for each
   direction. All defined flows will be considered within the same
   quality profile, which is determined by the qos-level attribute in
   each direction.

   During negotiation phase control ports will be used for Q-HTTP
   messages, and this is the reason to separate application data ports
   from Q-HTTP control ports, otherwise they could collide.

   The control should involve two UDP flows (one for uplink and other
   for downlink) and two TCP flows (one for uplink and other for
   downlink), but application data could involve many flows, depending
   on the nature of the application. The initial contact can be achieved
   at TCP port 80 (for example), but during negotiation phase the
   control ports (UDP and TCP) will be used instead of the original port
   used for handshake.

   The semantics of "downlink port" and "uplink port" is done in
   reference to destination. Therefore, a downlink port is a port in
   which client is listening for receiving server messages (and MUST be
   used as origin port of client responses), and an uplink port is a
   port in which server is listening incoming messages from client (and
   MUST be used as origin port of server responses).

   In addition, measurement parameters are included using the session
   attribute "measurement". The first measurement parameter is the
   procedure. By default, Q-HTTP provides a "default" procedure for
   measurement, but others like RTP/RTCP might be used. In the initial
   client request a set of measurement procedures can be sent to the
   server for negotiation (one line MUST be included in SDP for each
   one). The server will answer with only one line with the chosen
   procedure.

   For each procedure, a set of values of parameters can be included in
   the same attribute line, as in the following example:

   a=measurement:procedure default,50/50,75/75,5000,0


   Where the procedure name is "default" and one parameter is included
   separated by ",". The meaning of each value depends on the procedure.
   In the procedure "default", the meaning of these parameters are:

      o The first parameter is the interval of time (in milliseconds)
         between PING messages in the negotiation phase. Forward and
         reverse values are separated by "/". This allows to have two
         different responsiveness depending on the control resources
         used in each direction.

      o The second parameter is the interval of time (in milliseconds)
         between PING messages in the continuity phase. Forward and
         reverse values are separated by "/".This allows to have two
         different responsiveness depending on the control resources
         used in each direction.

      o The third parameter is the time used to measure bandwidth
         during negotiation phase. If not present, a default value of
         5000 ms will be assumed. Forward and reverse values are
         separated by "/".

      o The fourth parameter indicates the mode for continuity phase (0
         means "normal" and 1 means "sliding window"). If not present,
         normal mode (default value of 0) will be assumed.

   Quality parameters read by the procedure provide a snapshot of the
   quality level reached in each stage.

   Since handshake phase does not make any measurement, this section
   could be empty or filled with dummy values, except procedure, which
   is mandatory to start the next protocol phase.

      3.1.2. Quality negotiation phase

   This phase depends on the chosen procedure. The following description
   corresponds to "default" procedure.

   The negotiation phase involves iterations of sequences of messages
   until the quality session is compliant with the minimum quality
   constraints or until the quality session is closed due to the
   impossibility to meet the constraints.

   In order to measure the quality parameters, the client and server can
   use different mechanisms. This document only describes the "default"
   mechanism, but others can be used, like RTP/RTCP (RFC 3550 [10]).
   Measurement of latency and jitter is done calculating the differences
   in arrival times of packets. This measurement can be achieved with a
   little bandwidth consumption, whereas bandwidth measurement involves
   higher bandwidth consumption in both directions (uplink and
   downlink).

   Therefore the measurements involve two parts:

      o Measurement of latencies, jitters and packet loss

      o Measurement of bandwidths and packet loss

   Notice that packet loss can be measured in both parts, because the
   messages used for measure latencies also can be used for packet loss
   measurement.

   These two parts are executed sequentially in order to save network
   resources. If the required latencies and jitters can not be reached,


Garcia Aranda            Expires May 8, 2011                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


   it makes no sense to waste network resources measuring bandwidth. In
   addition, if the achievement of the required latency and jitter
   implies upgrading the quality session level, the chance of succeeding
   in bandwidth measurement without retries is higher, saving network
   traffic.

   If the latency and jitter constraints are not empty, the negotiation
   phase begins with the Measurement of latencies and jitter. Otherwise
   this stage is skipped.

          3.1.2.1. Measurement of latencies and jitters

   The client starts the negotiation phase sending READY message using
   the TCP control ports defined in SDP. This READY message includes a
   specific header "Stage" in which the measurement stage is indicated.
   In the example, the value 0 means this stage: measurements of
   latencies, jitters and packet loss.

   The motivation for this READY message is to synchronize negotiation
   phases in multiple quality sessions (see 4.2) enabling the
   possibility to repeat a successful stage.

   =========================


   Just after this, the client MUST send a Q-HTTP message PING using the
   control flow UDP ports defined in the SDP received at handshake. The
   downlink port is set as destination and the uplink port is set as
   origin (according to the example, from client UDP port 56000 to
   server UDP port 55000).

   This is an example of the message sent from the client and the server
   response:

   Client Request:
   =========================
          PING httpq://www.example.com Q-HTTP/1.0
          Session-id: 53655765

   The meaning of this method is similar to ICMP PING. Basically the
   server MUST answer as soon as it receives the message, in order to
   allow the client to measure the Round trip time (RTT). The RTT is the

   sum of downlink latency (normally named "reverse latency") and uplink
   latency (normally named "forward latency").

   The client MUST send periodically Q-HTTP PING messages, using always
   the same UDP control ports and does not need to wait for a response
   to send the next PING. It simply sends periodically a PING message
   with a different value of Message-id. Each message is identified by a
   header "Message-Id". This value is a sequential integer number and
   MUST start at zero. If this stage is repeated, the initial message-id
   MUST start again at zero.

   Optionally the PING request can include a header "Timestamp", with
   the UTC time in nanoseconds in which the message has been sent. In
   case the header is present, the server MUST include the header in the
   response without changing the value.

   In this phase, the interval between PING messages is defined in the
   first parameter of the attribute line of SDP where the procedure is
   specified. In the example, this value is 50 milliseconds (from the
   client to the server) and 60ms (from the server to the client).

   a=measurement:procedure default,50/60,50/50,5000,0


   A couple of correlated messages (request and response with the same
   message-id) allow to calculate one sample of RTT.

   This process could take a few seconds (in the example, five seconds),
   and after this time, at least 100 samples of RTT MUST be taken by the
   client.

   Every time a request message is received by the server, the uplink
   jitter calculation is updated by the server using the Statistical
   Jitter value which is calculated on the first 100 packets received
   using the statistical variance formula:


      Jitter Statistical = SquareRootOf(SumOf((ElapsedTime[i]-
   Average)^2)/(ReceivedPacketCount-1))


   Hence the client sends a PING periodically with a fixed interval,
   each value of "elapsed time" (ET) should be very close to this
   interval. If a PING message is lost, the elapsed time value is
   doubled, however, this is not an issue because all PING messages are
   labeled with a Message-Id header. Therefore the receiver can discard
   this elapsed time value. In order to have the first jitter sample,

   the server needs to receive 3 PING messages, because each ET is the
   time between two PINGs and a Jitter needs at least two ET.

   In order to be able to measure the Jitter in both directions, just
   after receiving the READY message from the Client, the server MUST
   begin to do exactly the same, using UDP control ports to send PING
   messages periodically towards the client.

   Every time a request PING message is received by the client, the
   downlink jitter calculation is updated by the client.

   After 100 samples the client has the values of RTT and downlink
   jitter and the server has RTT and uplink jitter.

   In addition, packet loss is measured in both directions, because
   Message-id headers are incremented sequentially. Hence, the client
   knows exactly the number of messages lost from the server to the
   client, and the server knows the number of packet lost from the
   client to the server.

   At this point, the client MUST send a message to the server using TCP
   control port requesting instructions. This message MUST be sent
   independently of the used measurement procedure. In the body of the
   request message the SDP is sent, with updated values of latency,

   In the 412 message, the server may include a different value for
   "qos-level" SDP session-level attribute, and the measurements done by
   the client. All these information MUST be protected using the
   signature header.

   After a 412 message received by the client, a Q-HTTP message (using
   TCP control port) with method "QOS-ALERT" is released by the client

   to acknowledge the SLA violation. Notice that the server signature
   header is present in the client request, in order to allow an
   optional integrity validation.

   If the header "Q-HTTP-policy-server" was included in the server
   response of the handshake phase, this message MUST be sent to the URI
   indicated in this header, otherwise the QOS-ALERT message MUST be
   sent to the server.

   After client receives this answer, client waits for a while indicated
   in the server message header "Guard-time" (in milliseconds), for
   example to allow different actions to be carried out by the server.
   (5 seconds should be enough, but this depends on each case) and begin
   again the measurement process, starting from the beginning, with the
   invocation of READY method by the client. The maximum qos-level is
   9/9 and if this value is reached without reaching the constraints,
   the quality session is aborted using the method CANCEL, which is
   detailed further.

   If the client does not respect the "Guard-time", and sends the READY
   message quickly, then the server MUST wait and not answer the READY
   message until the guard time is elapsed.

   If during the measurement process some interferences disturb or
   affect the measurement results, it is better to repeat again the
   process rather than alerting of an SLA violation. This is always
   possible by sending current values of parameter "qos-level" without
   changes, and in this case a header Guard-time can be set to "0". It
   is a good practice to repeat the measurements before reporting a
   violation.



3.1.2.1.2. Constraints not reached with Policy server involved

   If during handshake phase the optional header Q-HTTP-policy-server is
   included in the server response, the QOS-ALERT message MUST be sent
   to the policy server, which should implement all or some of these
   features (but not exclusive to):

      o Client and server validation in terms of SLA.

      o Authentication (Signature validation) and security (block
         malicious clients)

      o Policy rules ( following rules are only examples):

           - Maximum quality level allowed for the ACP

           - Time bands allowed for provide quality sessions for the ACP

           - Number of simultaneous quality sessions allowed

           - Maximum time used by quality sessions allowed

           - Etc.

   With policy server, the QOS-ALERT message sent by the client MUST
   contain the URIs of the server and the client to be contacted later
   by the policy server. Therefore the following headers MUST be
   included in the client request: "Q-HTTP-Resource-server" and "Q-HTTP-
   Resource-client"

   Depending on the results of the operations achieved by polity server,
   the client could receive different types of errors or CANCEL
   messages.

   The flows of messages in this case are in the following figure:

   |                                                |
   +------------------------------------------------+

                          Figure 7 Policy server.

   If the validation or authentication of the QOS-ALERT operation fails,
   the policy will send a CANCEL operation to the client without
   contacting the server.

   If any of the policy rules fail, the server will send a 6XX error to
   the client, indicating the rule which is not satisfied.

   Only if the validation, authentication and policy checking are
   successful, the server is contacted by the policy server and the QOS-
   ALERT message is forwarded to it.



3.1.2.1.3. Constraints reached

   When latency and jitter measurements match the constraints, the
   server answer should be 200 OK:

   If the bandwidth constraints are not empty, the negotiation phase

          3.1.2.2. Measurement of bandwidth and packet loss

   This stage begins in the same way as the previous one, sending a
   READY message over TCP control ports. This READY message includes a

   In the example, the value 1 means this stage: measurements of

   Just after receiving the 200 OK, both client and the server MUST
   start sending messages simultaneously using the UDP control ports, at
   the needed rate to reach the bandwidth constraint in each direction
   using messages of 1 Kbyte length. The messages are sent during a
   period of time defined in the SDP. This time is the third parameter
   of procedure "default", in milliseconds. If this parameter is not
   present, a value of 5 seconds will be used by default.

   The goal of this phase is not to measure the internet connection
   bandwidth connection but to measure if the quality constraints can be
   reached or not. This is the reason for not sending more bit rate than
   needed.

   All messages to be sent MUST be 1 kilobyte length (hence the size of
   the body depends on the size of included headers), and include a
   Message-id header with a sequential number which starts at 0. If the
   stage is repeated, the values MUST start again at zero. Examples:

   The messages MUST NOT be answered, but only sent. The client will
   send packets to the server in order to allow server measure client
   bandwidth, and the server will do the same towards the client. The
   packets have a message-Id to be aware of the packet loss at
   reception. The value of message-Id will start at cero and will be
   incremented by 1 for each message.

   After a 5 seconds measurements the client has a collection of server
   messages and may calculate the packet loss and downlink bandwidth
   received. At the other side, the server has the uplink bandwidth and
   packet loss.

   Client MUST send a GET message to the server using the TCP control
   port including the SDP data filled up with the measured downlink
   bandwidth and packet loss.

   Once client receives this answer, client and server wait for a while
   indicated in the server message header "Guard-time" (in
   milliseconds), for example to allow different actions to be carried
   out by the server (5 seconds should be enough, but this depends on
   each case) and begin again the measurement process (bandwidth and
   packet loss), starting with a READY message indicating the current
   stage (1). The maximum qos-level is 9/9 and if this value is reached
   without matching the constraints, the quality session is aborted
   using the method CANCEL, which is detailed further in this document.

3.1.2.4. Qos Level increments without changes in network behaviour

   If the qos-level has not reached the maximum value (9) but after 3
   QOS-ALERT messages (with increments in qos-level) the network remains
   with the same quality values, the client and the server MUST
   understand that the network can not reach the desired quality and
   will abort the session in order to save resources (time and traffic).
   To do that, client MUST sent a CANCEL message and the server MUST
   answer with a CANCEL message too.

   If the client does not send a CANCEL message but any other, the
   server MUST answer with a CANCEL message.

3.1.2.5. Trigger an application in combination with HTTP

   When the negotiation phase is successful, an optional simple
   mechanism, based on http, is defined to trigger the application.

   The application may be triggered using an URI, by means of an http
   request, just after negotiation success. The URI MUST be specified in
   the Q-http header "Trigger-URI". Other mechanisms, such as including
   a "Location" header in the Q-http message, to force redirection is

             Figure 13 Trigger the application using HTTP URI


   In the example, an integration of http and Q-http is shown. First,
   the client contacts the server using http, a redirection to a Q-http
   URI is achieved and the User Agent starts the Q-http handshake phase.
   After negotiation phase succeeds, the client trigger the application
   using the URI indicated in the Q-http 200 OK message.


      3.1.3. Continuity phase

   During negotiation phase the latency, jitter, bandwidth and packet
   loss can be measured, but during continuity phase bandwidth will not
   be measured because bandwidth measurements may disturb application
   performance.

   This phase is supposed to be executed at the same time as the real
   time application is being used.

   In the default measurement procedure, two working modes are defined

   modes are procedure dependant, and this draft only covers the default
   procedure.



          3.1.3.1. Normal mode

   The server can force the use of normal mode by setting the fourth
   parameter of "procedure" SDP attribute to 0. If this parameter is not
   set, the default value is assumed (cero), and normal mode will be
   used.

   Example:

       a=measurement:procedure default,50/50,50/50,5000,0

   Considering that network conditions can change, periodically the
   client may re-executes the negotiation phase. The maximum interval
   expected to restart the negotiation phase is indicated in the Q-HTTP
   Expires header.

   However, the measurements can be achieved periodically with a smaller
   period of time than "Expires" header value, in order to make sure
   that the communication matches the constraints. In intense
   interactive applications, like arcade videogames, the period to
   repeat the measurements may be very small (even cero), in order to
   measure continuously the quality and assure the best reaction time.
   To reach the best reaction time, the use of sliding window mode is
   recommended.

   To start the continuity phase, the client sends a Q-HTTP READY
   method, using the TCP control port, exactly the same as Negotiation,
   indicating the new Stage header value for continuity phase (value 2).

   After these messages starts latency, jitter and packet loss
   measurement, taking care of bandwidth usage. If the default
   measurement method is being used, it is recommended to use a larger
   interval for PING messages, but the same number of samples will be
   taken to check quality. The goal of increment the interval of PING
   messages is to minimize the load of the server which would be running
   lots of connections in parallel.

   The process is the same as described in the negotiation phase. The
   difference is the time between samples, because the bandwidth usage
   MUST be protected. The interval used for this phase is indicated in
   the second parameter of the attribute line for the procedure. In this
   example, the interval is 75 milliseconds.

   A value larger than used in negotiation phase is recommended, but not
   mandatory.

          3.1.3.2. Sliding window mode

   In order to improve the reaction time when network conditions degrade
   quickly, the server can force the use of sliding window mode by
   setting the fourth parameter of "procedure" SDP attribute to 1.

   Example:

   The sliding window mode applies a sliding window of 100 samples
   instead cycles of 100 samples.

   In the sliding window mode, PING messages are sent continuously (by
   client and server) and when Message-id header reach the value of 100,
   client MUST NOT send a GET message for instructions, but continues
   sending PING messages with Message-id header starting again at zero.
   When the server PING Message-id header reaches 100, do the same,
   starting again at zero.

   On the client side, the measured values of downlink jitter, downlink
   packet loss and latency are calculated using the last samples,
   discarding older ones, in a sliding window schema.

   Only when the client detects that the measured values (downlink
   jitter, downlink packet loss and latency) are not reaching the
   constraints, send a GET message to the server.

   When the server receives the Q-HTTP GET message, it stops sending
   PING packets and answer the GET request. If a 412 message is
   answered, then a QOS-ALERT will be requested by client, exactly in
   the same way as described in normal mode.

   On the other hand, if the server detects that the measured values
   (uplink jitter, uplink packet loss and latency) are not reaching the
   constraints, it MUST choose between the following alternatives:

      o The server stops sending PING messages to the client. In this
         case the client MUST notice this lack of PING messages by using
         a timeout at reception, and it reacts stopping the sending of
         PING messages and sends a GET message for instructions, exactly
         in the same way as described in normal mode.

      o It continues sending PING messages but all of them with
         Message-id set to -1 till a client GET message is received.
         Then the server stops sending PING messages and answers the GET
         request with the corresponding 412 error, exactly in the same
         way as described in normal mode. Client reacts when it receives
         a PING with Message-id header set to -1, sending this GET
         request. This behaviour allows the shortest reaction time under
         degradation of network conditions.

   Both alternatives MUST be implemented by the Q-HTTP client.

   3.2. Dynamic constraints and flows

   Depending on the nature of the application, the constraints to be
   reached can evolve, changing some of all constraint values in both
   directions.

   This possibility MUST be supported by the client. When the server
   sends a SDP embedded into a error message (200 OK, or 412, etc), the
   client MUST assume all the new values of the received SDP.

   The dynamic changes on the constraints can be the result of these two
   possibilities:

      o If the application communicates with the Q-HTTP server to
         change constraints. In this case the application requirements
         can evolve and Q-HTTP server will be aware of them.

      o If the application uses TCP flows. In that case, in order to
         guarantee a constant throughput, the nature of TCP behavior
         forces the use of a composite constraint function which depends
         on RTT, packet loss and window control mechanism implemented in
         each TCP stack.

   TCP throughput can be less than actual bandwidth in particular if the
   Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) is large or if a network suffers from a
   high packet loss rate. In both cases, TCP's congestion control
   algorithms may result in a suboptimal performance.

   Different TCP congestion control implementations like Reno [14], High
   Speed TCP (RFC 3649 [15]), CUBIC [16], Compound TCP (CTCP [17]), etc.
   reach different throughputs under the same network conditions of RTT
   and packetloss. In all cases, depending on RTT measured value, Q-HTTP
   server could change dynamically the packetloss constraints (defined
   in SDP) in order to make possible to reach a required throughput or
   viceversa (use packetloss measurement to change dynamically latency
   constraints).

   A general guideline to calculate the packetloss constraint and RTT
   constraint consists in approximating the throughput using a
   simplified formula which should take into account the TCP stack
   implementation of the receiver, in addition to RTT and packet loss:

             Th= Function( RTT, packet loss, ...)

   Then, depending on RTT measured values, set dynamically the
   packetloss constraint.

   It is possible to calculate easily a worst-case boundary for the Reno
   algorithm which should ensure for all algorithms that the target
   throughput is actually achieved. Except that, high-speed algorithms
   will then have even a larger throughput, if more bandwidth is
   available.

   For Reno algorithm, it may be used the Mathis' formula [15] for the
   upper bound on the throughput :

            Th <= (MSS/RTT)*(1 / sqrt{p})

   In absence of packet loss, a practical limit for TCP throughput is
   the receiver_window_size divided by the round-trip time. However, if
   the TCP implementation uses window scale option, this limit can reach
   the available bandwidth value.

   3.3. QoS-level downgrade operation

   During the continuity phase might be desirable to downgrade the
   current QoS-level SDP parameter.

   The strategy to carry out downgrades must include the possibility to
   exclude specific data flows from SDP dynamically. A Q-HTTP client
   MUST allow this kind of SDP modifications by server.

   Periodically (each several minutes, depending on the implementation)
   server could force a QOS-ALERT, in which the level is downgraded for
   control flows, excluding application data flows from the embedded SDP
   of that request. To set the new SDP, the server MUST include the
   modified SDP in the 412 error message.

   This mechanism allows to measure at lower levels of quality while
   application flows continue using a higher qos level value

      o If the measurements in the lower level meet the constraints,
         then a new QOS-ALERT to this lower qos-level can be forced by
         server, in which the SDP includes the application data flows in
         addition to control flows.

      o If the measurements in the lower level do not meet the
         constraints, then a new QOS-ALERT to the previous qos-level
         MUST be forced by the server, in which the SDP includes only
         the control flows.

   This mechanism avoids the risk of disturbing the application, while
   the measurements are being run in lower levels. However, this
   optimization of resources is optional, and MUST be used carefully.

   The chosen period to measure a lower qos level is implementation
   dependant. Therefore it is not included as a measurement procedure
   parameter. It is recommended to use a large value, such as 20
   minutes.

   3.4. Sanity check of Quality sessions

   A session may finish by several reasons (client shutdown, client
   CANCEL request, constraints not reached, etc), and any session
   finished MUST release the assigned resources.

   In order to release the assigned server resources for the session,
   the header "Expires" indicate the maximum interval of time that a
   client can wait to repeat the continuity phase (in normal mode).

4. Q-HTTP messages

   Q-HTTP is a text-based protocol and uses the UTF-8 charset (RFC 3629
   [11]). A Q-HTTP message is either a request or a response.

   Both Request and Response messages use the basic format of Internet
   Message Format (RFC 5322 [12]). Both types of messages consist of a
   start-line, one or more header fields, an empty line indicating the
   end of the header fields, and an optional message-body.


         generic-message  =  start-line
                             *message-header
                             CRLF
                             [ message-body ]
         start-line       =  Request-Line / Status-Line

   The start-line, each message-header line, and the empty line MUST be
   terminated by a carriage-return line-feed sequence (CRLF).  Note that
   the empty line MUST be present even if the message-body is not.

      Much of Q-HTTP's messages and header field syntax are identical to
   HTTP/1.1. However, Q-HTTP is not an extension of HTTP.



   4.1. Requests

   Q-HTTP requests are distinguished by having a Request-Line for a
   start-line. A Request-Line contains a method name, a Request-URI ,
   and the protocol version separated by a single space (SP) character.

   The Request-Line ends with CRLF. No CR or LF are allowed except in
   the end-of-line CRLF sequence. No linear whitespace (LWS) is allowed
   in any of the elements.

         Request-Line  =  Method SP Request-URI SP Q-HTTP-Version CRLF

    Method: This specification defines five methods: GET for get
          information and send quality reports, PING and DATA for
          quality measurements purpose, CANCEL for terminating sessions,
          and QOS-ALERT for querying ISPs for quality upgrades.

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010



    Request-URI: The Request-URI is a Q-http URI (RFC 2396 )as described
          in 2.2.1 It Normally indicates the user or service to which
          this request is being addressed, but in the Q-http context,
          there are some methods which URI only reflects the service on
          the server side, but nor more. This is the case of method QOS-
          ALERT, because the real address of a QoS upgrade request is
          the network, and therefore in this case the URI only reflects
          the server address. In addition the method CANCEL has the same
          treatment, and in the methods ECHO and DATA invoked by server
          to the client the meaning of the URI is only the URI of the
          service, but not the destination of the request. The Request-
          URI MUST NOT contain unescaped spaces or control characters
          and MUST NOT be enclosed in "<>".

    Q-HTTP-Version: Both request and response messages include the
          version of Q-HTTP in use. To be compliant with this
          specification, applications sending Q-HTTP messages MUST
          include a Q-HTTP-Version of "Q-HTTP/1.0".  The Q-HTTP-Version
          string is case-insensitive, but implementations MUST send
          upper-case. Unlike HTTP/1.1, Q-HTTP treats the version number
          as a literal string.  In practice, this should make no
          difference.

   4.2. Responses

   In Q-HTTP there are 2 types of responses:

      o Responses that follow the same syntax rules of a request: these
         cases are for methods which suggest actions, as QOS-ALERT and
         CANCEL. After a successful negotiation phase, instead of using
         a 2xx response code, a request is generated as response
         message. However, these methods can have a conventional answer
         if an error is detected.

      o Conventional responses, where the server is answering to a
         previous client request.

   Q-HTTP conventional responses are distinguished from requests by
   having a Status-Line as their start-line. A Status-Line consists of
   the protocol version followed by a numeric Status-Code and its
   associated textual phrase, with each element separated by a single SP
   character. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


     Status-Line  =  Q-HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF

   The Status-Code is a 3-digit integer result code that indicates the
   outcome of an attempt to understand and satisfy a request. The
   Reason-Phrase is intended to give a short textual description of the
   Status-Code.  The Status-Code is intended for use by automata,
   whereas the Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. A client is
   not required to examine or display the Reason-Phrase.

   While this specification suggests specific wording for the reason
   phrase, implementations MAY choose other text, for example, in the
   language indicated in the Accept-Language header field of the
   request.

   The first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response. The
   last two digits do not have any categorization role.  For this
   reason, any response with a status code between 100 and 199 is
   referred to as a "1xx response", any response with a status code
   between 200 and 299 as a "2xx response", and so on.  Q-HTTP/1.0
   allows following values for the first digit:


         1xx: Provisional -- request received, continuing to process the
              request;

         2xx: Success -- the action was successfully received,
              understood, and accepted;

         3xx: Redirection -- further action needs to be taken in order
              to complete the request;

         4xx: Client Error -- the request contains bad syntax or cannot
              be fulfilled at this server;

         5xx: Server Error -- the server failed to fulfill an apparently
              valid request;

         6xx: Global Failure -- the request cannot be fulfilled at any
              server.

   The status codes are the same described in HTTP (RFC 2616 [1]). In
   the same way as HTTP, Q-HTTP applications are not required to
   understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
   understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST
   understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first

   digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the
   x00 status code of that class


   4.3. Header Fields

   Q-HTTP header fields are identical to HTTP header fields in both
   syntax and semantics.

   Some header fields only make sense in requests or responses.  These
   are called request header fields and response header fields,
   respectively.  If a header field appears in a message not matching
   its category (such as a request header field in a response), it MUST
   be ignored.

      4.3.1. Specific Q-HTTP Request Header Fields

   In addition to HTTP header fields, these are the specific Q-HTTP
   request header fields

      o Session-id: the value for this header is the same session id
         used in SDP and is assigned by server. The messages without SDP
         MUST include this header. If a message has SDP, the header is
         optional. The method of <session id> allocation is up to the
         creating tool, but it has been suggested that a Network Time
         Protocol (NTP) timestamp be used to ensure uniqueness.

      o Message-id: sequential integer number assigned to PING and DATA
         messages.

      o Timestamp: UTC time in nanoseconds. Indicates the time in which
         the request was sent.

      o Signature: this header contains a digital signature that can be
         used by the network to validate the SDP. The signature is
         always generated by the server. It is optional.

      o Q-HTTP-Resource-client: this optional header contains the
         relative URI in charge of this session. In The case of being
         included, it MUST appear in the GET request of handshake phase.
         This URI MUST be invoked by the server in all later requests.
         It is optional, but it should be present, it becomes mandatory
         for the counterpart. This URI MUST be relative because user
         agents can not have associated domain, in addition to ignore
         their public IP address.

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


      4.3.2. Specific Q-HTTP Response Header Fields

      o Expires: the purpose is to provide a sanity check and allow the
         server to close inactive sessions. If the client does not send
         a new request before the expiration time, the server can close
         the session. The value MUST be an integer and the measurement
         unit are milliseconds.

      o Guard-time: A time interval left vacant (i.e., during which no
         data is sent) during the quality session. The guard time
         provides a safety margin before re-starting each measurement
         process when a QOS-ALERT has been raised. This header is
         optional in all messages but mandatory in the QOS-ALERT sent by
         the server.

      o Message-id: same meaning as Request Header Fields

      o Timestamp: UTC time in nanoseconds. Indicates the time in which
         the request was sent. If the server (or a client) receives a
         Timestamp header in a request, MUST include the same header
         with the same value in the response. The purpose of this header
         is simplify the RTT calculation.

      o Signature: same meaning as Request Header Fields

      o Q-HTTP-Resource-server: this optional header contains the URI
         in charge of this session. In case of being included, it MUST
         appear in the response of handshake phase. This URI MUST be
         invoked by the client in all later requests. It is optional,
         but it should be present, it becomes mandatory for the
         counterpart.

      o Q-HTTP-policy-server: this optional header contains the URI
         towards the client and MUST send the QOS-ALERT messages. In
         case this header is present, the header Q-HTTP-Resource-server
         is mandatory, and MUST be included in the QOS-ALERT messages
         sent by the client to the policy server. In addition, the QOS-
         ALERT sent to the policy server MUST contain the header Q-HTTP-
         Resource-client



   4.4. Bodies

     Requests, including new requests defined in extensions to this
   specification, MAY contain message bodies unless otherwise noted. The
   interpretation of the body depends on the request method.


Garcia Aranda            Expires May 8, 2011                 [Page 51]

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


   For response messages, the request method and the response status
   code determine the type and interpretation of any message body.  All
   responses MAY include a body.

   The Internet media type of the message body MUST be given by the
   Content-Type header field.

      4.4.1. Encoding

      The body MUST NOT be either encoded or compressed. This mechanism
   is valid for other protocols such as HTTP and SIP (RFC 3261 [13]),
   but a compression/coding scheme will limit certain logical
   implementations of the way the request is parsed, thus, making the
   protocol concept more implementation dependant. In addition,
   bandwidth calculation may not be valid if compression is used.
   Therefore, the HTTP request header "Accept-Encoding" can not be used
   in Q-HTTP with different values than "identity" and if it is present
   in a request, the server MUST ignore it. In addition, the response
   header "Content-Encoding" is optional, but if present, the unique
   permitted value is "identity".

   The body length in bytes is provided by the Content-Length header
   field. The "chunked" transfer encoding of HTTP/1.1 MUST NOT be used
   for Q-HTTP (Note: The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message
   in order to transfer it as a series of chunks, each one with its own
   size indicator.)


5. General User Agent behavior.

   5.1. Roles

   In order to allow peer to peer applications, a Q-HTTP User Agent (UA)
   MUST be able to assume both client and server role. The role assumed
   depends on who sends the first message.

   In a communication between two UA, the first UA who sends the Q-HTTP
   BEGIN message for starting the handshake phase will assume the client
   role.

   If both send the message at the same time, then both will wait a
   random time to restart again.

   Otherwise, an UA may be configured to act only as server (e.g.,
   content provider's side).

   5.2. Multiple Quality sessions in parallel

   A quality session is intended to be used for an application. It means
   that for using the application, the client MUST establish only one
   quality session against the server. Indeed, the relation between
   session-id and application is 1 to 1.

   If a user wants to participate in several independent quality
   sessions simultaneously against different servers (or against the
   same server) can execute different Q-HTTP clients to establish
   separately different quality sessions but it is not recommended,
   because:

      o The establishment of a new quality session may affect other
         running applications over other quality sessions. Thus, minimum
         quality level may not be achieved depending on individual
         requirements of each application.

      o If the negotiation phase is executed separately before running
         any application, the quality requirements could not be assured
         when the applications are running in parallel.

   For running different applications in parallel it is highly
   recommended to execute the negotiation phase of all of them
   simultaneously, in order to assure the quality constraints of all
   applications in parallel. To do that, a single User Agent software
   MUST be used, and this User Agent MUST be able to launch several
   quality session negotiation in parallel, synchronizing the beginning
   of each negotiation phase, and running again the negotiation phase of
   all applications in parallel until all of them succeed.

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


   In order to repeat the execution of a negotiation phase that has been
   succeeded, both, client and server MUST allow using the READY method
   with a Stage header value already succeeded.

   5.3. General client behavior

   An Q-HTTP Client has different behaviors. We will use letters X,Y,Z
   for designate each different behavior (follow the letter bullets in
   the figure below).

      X) When it sends messages over TCP (methods GET, QOS-ALERT and
      CANCEL) behaves strictly like a state machine which sends messages
      and wait for responses. Depending on the response type it enters
      in a new state.

   When sends UDP messages (methods PING and DATA), a Q-HTTP client is
   not strictly a state machine which sends messages and wait for
   receiving responses because:


      Y) At latency, jitter and packet loss measurement, the PING
      requests (over UDP) are sent periodically, not after receiving the
      response to the previous request. In addition, the client MUST
      answer the PING messages received from server, therefore assumes
      the role of a server.

      Z) At bandwidth and packet loss measurement stage, the client does
      not expect to receive responses when sends DATA requests (over
      UDP) to the server. In addition, it MUST receive and process all
      server messages in order to achieve the downlink measurement.

   In addition to this special behavior, the methods QOS-ALERT and
   CANCEL have successful responses which follow the same syntax rules
   of a request (instead of 2xx response code). However, these methods
   may have a conventional answer if an error is produced.

                   Figure 18 Phases & client behaviors.



      5.3.1. Generating requests

   A valid Q-HTTP request formulated by a Client MUST, at a minimum,
   contain the following header fields:

   If no SDP is included: This is the case of PING and DATA messages.
   The header Session-id and Message-id are mandatory.

   If SDP is included: this is the case of GET, QOS-ALERT and CANCEL
   messages. Inside SDP is included Session-id, therefore the inclusion
   of session-id header is optional.

   5.4. General server behavior

   If a Server does not understand a header field in a request (that is,
   the header field is not defined in this specification or in any
   supported extension), the server MUST ignore that header field and
   continue processing the message.

   The role of server is changed at negotiation and continuity phases,
   in which server MUST send packets to measure jitter, latency and
   bandwidth. Therefore, the different behaviors of server are (follow
   the letter bullets in the figure below):

      R) When the client sends messages over TCP (methods GET, QOS-ALERT
      and CANCEL) behaves strictly like a state machine which receives
      messages and sends responses.

   When the client begins to send UDP messages (methods PING and DATA),
   a Q-HTTP server is not strictly a state machine which receives
   messages and sends responses because:

      S) At latency, jitter and packet loss measurement, the PING
      requests (over UDP) are sent periodically by the client but also
      by the server. In this case the server behaves as a server
      answering client requests but also behaves as a client, sending
      PING messages toward the client and receiving responses.

      T) At bandwidth and packet loss measurement, the server sends DATA
      requests (over UDP) to the client. In addition, MUST receive and
      process client messages in order to achieve the uplink
      measurement.

   In addition to this special behavior, the methods QOS-ALERT and
   CANCEL have successful responses which follow the same syntax rules
   of a request (instead of 2xx response code). However, these methods
   may have a conventional answer if an error is produced.

6. Q-HTTP method definitions

   The Method token indicates the method to be performed on the resource
   identified by the Request-URI. The method is case-sensitive.







Garcia Aranda            Expires May 8, 2011                 [Page 56]

          Method  = "BEGIN" | "PING" | "DATA" | "GET" | "QOS-ALERT" |
                    "CANCEL" | "READY" | extension-method

          extension-method = token

   The list of methods allowed by a resource can be specified in an
   "Allow" header field (RFC 2616 [1] section 14.7). The return code of
   the response always notifies the client when a method is currently
   allowed on a resource, since the set of allowed methods can change
   dynamically. Any server application SHOULD return the status code 405
   (Method Not Allowed) if the method is known, but not allowed for the
   requested resource, and 501 (Not Implemented) if the method is
   unrecognized or not implemented by the server.

   6.1. BEGIN

   The BEGIN method means request information from a resource identified
   by a q-http URI. The semantics of this method is the starting of a
   quality session.

   This method is only used in handshake phase to retrieve the SDP
   containing all quality parameters for the desired application to run.

   In the negotiation and continuity phases, this method is not used.
   when a BEGIN message is received by the server, any current quality
   session is cancelled and a new session should be created.

   The response to a Q-HTTP BEGIN request is not cacheable.

   6.2. GET

   The GET method means retrieve information from a resource identified
   by a q-http URI.

   In the negotiation and continuity phases, this method is used to
   check if the server considers the quality good enough to execute the
   desired application. If the measured quality is not enough, the
   server will return a 412 error.

   The response to a Q-HTTP GET request is not cacheable.



   6.3. READY

   The READY method is used to synchronize the starting time for sending
   of PING and DATA messages over UDP between client and servers.


Garcia Aranda            Expires May 8, 2011                 [Page 57]

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


   In addition, the Stage header included in this method is mandatory
   and allow clients repeat a test, which is needed in scenarios with
   multiple quality sessions between one client and different servers.

   This message is only used in negotiation and continuity phases, and
   only just before making a measurement. Otherwise (out of this
   context), the server MUST ignore this method.

   6.4. PING

   This message is used to measure the RTT and jitter of a session. The
   message MUST be sent only over UDP control port. If a server receives
   this message in other port it MUST ignore it.

   The fundamental difference between the PING and DATA requests is
   reflected in the different measurements achieved with them. PING is a
   short message, and MUST be answered in order to measure RTT, whereas
   DATA is a long message (1 Kbyte) and MUST NOT be answered.

   PING is a request method that can be originated by client but also by
   server. Client MUST answer the server PINGs, assuming a "server role"
   for these messages during measurement process.

   6.5. DATA

   This message is used to measure the bandwidth and packet loss of a
   session. The message MUST be sent only over UDP control port. If a
   server receives this message in other port it MUST ignore it.

   The fundamental difference between the PING and DATA requests is
   reflected in the different measurements achieved with them. PING is a
   short message, and MUST be answered in order to measure RTT, whereas
   DATA is a long message (1 Kbyte) and MUST NOT be answered.

   DATA is a request method that can be originated by client but also by
   server. Both (client and server) MUST NOT answer DATA messages.

   6.6. QOS-ALERT

   This is the message that Q-http generates when the measurements
   indicate that quality SLA is being violated. It is an informative
   message which indicates that the user's experience is being degraded
   and includes the details of the problem (bandwidth, jitter, packet
   loss measurements and the SLA). The QoS-ALERT message does not
   contain any detail on the actions to be taken, which depends on the
   agreements between all involved parties.

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


   The message has no conventional answer, but a request format message
   is answered from the server when it receives a client QOS-ALERT.

   This method can be initiated by client only after a 412 error coming
   from server, and with enough information to build the QOS-ALERT
   message.

   If the header "Q-HTTP-policy-server" was included in the server
   response of the handshake phase, the QOS-ALERT message MUST be sent
   to the URI indicated in this header, otherwise the QOS-ALERT message
   MUST be sent to the server.

   With policy server, the QOS-ALERT message sent by client MUST contain
   the URIs of the server and the client to be contacted later by the
   policy server. Therefore the following headers MUST be included in
   the client request: "Q-HTTP-Resource-server" and "Q-HTTP-Resource-
   client".

   The response to a Q-HTTP QOS-ALERT request is not cacheable.

   6.7. CANCEL

   Like QOS-ALERT, this message is used for communication with the
   network resources. The semantics in this case is the release of the
   special resources assigned to the session.

   In the same way as QOS-ALERT, CANCEL has the same type of response,
   with a request format.

7. Response codes

   All Q-HTTP response codes are used only in TCP control flows. Never
   in UDP message flows, which are used for measurements.

   7.1. 100 trying

   This response indicates that the request has been received by the
   next-hop server (the policy server) and that some unspecified action
   is being taken on behalf of this request (for example, a database is
   being consulted). This response, like all other provisional
   responses, stops retransmissions of a QOS-ALERT by the client.

   7.2. 200 OK

   The request has succeeded.

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


   7.3. Redirection 3xx

   3xx responses give information about the user's new location, or
   about alternative services that might be able to satisfy the request.

   The requesting client SHOULD retry the request at the new address(es)
   given by the Location header field.

   7.4. Request Failure 4xx

   4xx responses are definite failure responses from a particular
   server. The client SHOULD NOT retry the same request without
   modification (for example, adding appropriate headers or SDP values).
   However, the same request to a different server might be successful.

      7.4.1. 400 Bad Request

   The request could not be understood due to malformed syntax. The
   Reason-Phrase SHOULD identify the syntax problem in more detail, for
   example, "Missing Message-id header field".

      7.4.2. 404 Not Found

   The server has definitive information that the user does not exist at
   the domain specified in the Request-URI. This status is also returned
   if the domain in the Request-URI does not match any of the domains
   handled by the recipient of the request.

      7.4.3. 405 Method Not Allowed

   The method specified in the Request-Line is understood, but not
   allowed for the address identified by the Request-URI.

   The response MUST include an Allow header field containing a list of
   valid methods for the indicated address.

      7.4.4. 406 Not Acceptable

   The resource identified by the request is only able of generating
   response entities that have content characteristics not acceptable
   according to the Accept header field sent in the request.

      7.4.5. 408 Request Timeout

   The server could not produce a response within a suitable amount of
   time, and the client MAY repeat the request without modifications at
   any later time

      7.4.6. 412 A precondition has not been met

   The server is indicating that the SLA is being violated.

      7.4.7. 413 Request Entity Too Large

   The server is refusing to process a request because the request
   entity-body is larger than the one that the server is willing or able
   to process. The server MAY close the connection to prevent the client
   from continuing the request.

      7.4.8. 414 Request-URI Too Long

   The server is refusing to process the request because the Request-URI
   is longer than the one that the server accepts.

      7.4.9. 415 Unsupported Media Type

   The server is refusing to process the request because the message
   body of the request is in a format not supported by the server for
   the requested method. The server MUST return a list of acceptable
   formats using the Accept, Accept-Encoding, or Accept-Language header
   field, depending on the specific problem with the content.

      7.4.10. 416 Unsupported URI Scheme

   The server cannot process the request because the scheme of the URI
   in the Request-URI is unknown to the server.

   7.5. Server Failure 5xx

   5xx responses are failure responses given when a server itself is
   having trouble.

      7.5.1. 500 Server Internal Error

   The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from
   fulfilling the request. The client MAY display the specific error
   condition and MAY retry the request after several seconds.

      7.5.2. 501 Not Implemented

   The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the
   request. This is the appropriate response when a Server does not
   recognize the request method and it is not capable of supporting it
   for any user.

   Note that a 405 (Method Not Allowed) is sent when the server
   recognizes the request method, but that method is not allowed or
   supported.

      7.5.3. 503 Service Unavailable

   The server is temporarily unable to process the request due to a
   temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The server MAY
   indicate when the client should retry the request in a Retry-After
   header field. If no Retry-After is given, the client MUST act as if
   it had received a 500 (Server Internal Error) response.

   A client receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) SHOULD attempt to
   forward the request to an alternate server. It SHOULD NOT forward any
   other requests to that server for the duration specified in the
   Retry-After header field, if present.

   Servers MAY refuse the connection or drop the request instead of
   responding with 503 (Service Unavailable).

      7.5.4. 504 Server Time-out

   The server did not receive a timely response from an external server
   it accessed in attempting to process the request.

      7.5.5. 505 Version Not Supported

   The server does not support, or refuses to support, the Q-HTTP
   protocol version that was used in the request. The server is
   indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request
   using the same major version as the client, other than with this
   error message.

      7.5.6. 513 Message Too Large

   The server was unable to process the request since the message length
   exceeded its capabilities.

   7.6. Global Failures 6xx

   6xx responses indicate that a server has definitive information about
   a particular policy not satisfied for processing the request.

      7.6.1. 600 session not exist

   The session-id is not valid

      7.6.2. 601 quality level not allowed

   The QOS level requested is not allowed for the pair client/server

      7.6.3. 603 Session not allowed

   The session is not allowed due to some policy (number of sessions
   allowed for the server is exceeded, or the time band of the QOS-ALERT
   is not allowed for the pair client/server, etc)

      7.6.4. 604 authorization not allowed

   The policy server does not authorize the QOS-ALERT operation because
   any internal or external reason.


8. Implementation Recommendations

   8.1. Default client constraints

   To provide a default configuration, it would be good that the client
   had a configurable set of Quality headers in the browser settings
   menu. Otherwise these quality headers will not be present in the
   first message.

   Different business models (out of scope of this proposal) may be
   achieved: depending on who pays for the quality session, the server
   can accept certain Client parameters sent in the first message, or
   force billing parameters on the server side.

   8.2. Bandwidth measurements

   In programming languages or Operating Systems with timers or limited
   clock limited resolution, it is recommended to use an approach based
   on several intervals to send messages of 1KB, in order to reach the
   required bandwidth consumption using a rate closest as possible to a
   constant rate.

   For example, if the resolution is 1 millisecond, and the bandwidth to
   reach is 11Mbps, a good approach consists of sending:

     1 message of 1KB each 1 millisecond +

     1 message of 1KB each 3 milliseconds +

     1 message of 1KB each 23 milliseconds

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


   The number of intervals depends on required bandwidth and accuracy
   that the programmer wants to achieve.

   8.3. Packet loss measurement resolution

   Depending on application nature and network conditions, a packet loss
   resolution less than 1% may be needed. In such case, there is no
   limit to the number of samples used for this calculation. A tradeoff
   between time and resolution should be reached in each case. For
   example, in order to have a resolution of 1/10000, the last 10000
   samples should be considered in the packetloss measured value.

   The problem of this approach is the reliability of old samples. If
   the interval used between PING messages is 50ms, then to have a
   resolution of 1/1000 it takes 50 seconds and a resolution of 1/10000
   takes 500 seconds (more than 8 minutes). The reliability of a packet
   loss calculation based on a sliding window of 8 minutes depends on
   how fast network conditions evolve.

   8.4. qos-level dictionary

   There is no precise meaning for each level at all, but only the
   principle that, in general, a higher level should correspond to a
   better quality.

   8.5. Measurements and reactions

   Q-HTTP can be used as a mechanism for measure and trigger actions
   (i.e. lowering video bit-rate) in real-time in order to reach the
   application constraints, addressing measured possible network
   degradation.

   The trigger is based on message QOS-ALERT, which is always forced by
   the server response 412 error. A server can avoid these Q_OS-REQUEST
   messages sending 200 OK when a GET message is received from server,
   independently whether the constraints are met or not.



   8.6. Scenarios

   Q-HTTP could be used in two scenarios:

      o client to ACP (Application content provider )

      o client to client.

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010




      8.6.1. Client to ACP

   In this scenario, the policy server is optional. If it exists, the
   QOS-ALERT messages MUST be sent to this policy server which acts as a
   proxy for this type of messages and validates them (plus any other
   actions out of scope of this document).

   In order to avoid useless load on the server, the policy server could
   receive the BEGIN messages of handshake phase. For this purpose, the
   policy server MUST know the URI of the Q-HTTP servers.

   In this scenario a client could send the BEGIN to the policy server,
   with an additional parameter in the URI requested, which identifies
   the server, like:

   Httpq://www.policy.com/listofservers?id=xtiwn28821ho4

   Then the policy validates the request and forward the BEGIN to the Q-
   HTTP server, adding the Q-HTTP-Resource-server to the response for
   the client in the 200 OK response.

                         Figure 20 Policy server.

   In this scenario the client MUST send further messages directly to
   the server without passing through policy server.

      8.6.2. Client to client

   In order to solve the client to client scenario, a Q-HTTP register
   function MUST be implemented . This allows clients contact each other
   for sending the BEGIN message. In this scenario, the policy server



Garcia Aranda            Expires May 8, 2011                 [Page 65]

Internet-Draft The Quality Hypertext Transfer Protocol    November 2010


   MUST complete the Q-HTTP-Resource server with the public IP address
   of the peer which assumes the server role.

   The register function is out of scope of this protocol version,
   because different HTTP mechanisms can be used and Q-HTTP MUST NOT
   force any.

9. Security Considerations

   Different types of attacks can be avoided:

          o Spoofing of server IP address can be avoided using the
             digital signature mechanism. The network can validate
             easily this digital signature using the public key of the
             server certificate.

          o The client could try to send ALERT messages constantly,
             trying to enter in the negotiation phase continuously. In
             this case, the server MUST answer a message "CANCEL", in
             order to release the all levels reached and return to plain
             access without enhanced quality.

   This protocol could be supported over IPSec to increase privacy,
   although it is out of scope of this proposal.



10. IANA Considerations

   A specific port for Q-HTTP TCP control flow mechanism could be
   assigned. It could simplify the network implementation. Other
   possibility is to use any other port (like 80, HTTP). In this case
   the network could use the protocol designator "Q-HTTP" as the mark
   for distinguish and treat the packets.

   Q-HTTP uses SDP as a container for session information, in which
   quality attributes have been added as extended "session-level"
   attributes. These set of new attributes should be registered (in
   order to avoid the prefix "X-"). In this document, this set of
   attributes has been presented as registered attributes.

   This is the list of attribute field names to register:

         to server) and reverse (server to client) values separated by
         "/".

      o The second parameter is the interval of time (in milliseconds)

         to server) and reverse (server to client) values separated by
         "/".

      o The third parameter is the time used to measure bandwidth
         during negotiation phase. In case of not present, a default
         value of 5000 ms will be assumed.

      o The fourth parameter indicates the mode for continuity phase (0
         means "normal" and 1 means "sliding window"). In case of not be
         present, normal mode (default value of 0) will be assumed.

   Other procedure names are allowed, but at least "default" procedure
   implementation is mandatory in client and servers.

11. Conclusions

   Q-http defines three phases with different purposes, and inside
   these phases the negotiated measurement procedure is used. Different
   measurement procedures can be used (even RTCP itself) inside Q-HTTP.
   Basically, Q-HTTP only defines how to transport SLA information and
   measurement results as well as providing some mechanisms for
   alerting. Q-http does not ask for resources. Q-HTTP only alerts if
   one (or some) of SLA quality parameters are being violated. Depends
   on server (Application content provider) to do something with this
   information and return it back to a SLA-compliant state.

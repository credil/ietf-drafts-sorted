   Deterministic Usage of DSA and ECDSA Digital Signature Algorithms
                   draft-pornin-deterministic-dsa-00

Abstract

   This document defines a deterministic digital signature generation
   procedure.  Such signatures are compatible with standard DSA and
   ECDSA digital signatures, and can be processed with unmodified
   verifiers, which need not be aware of the procedure described
   therein.  Deterministic signatures retain the cryptographic security
   features associated with digital signatures, but can be more easily
   implemented in various environments since they do not need access to
   a source of high quality randomness.

1.  Introduction

   DSA [FIPS-186-3] and ECDSA [X9.62] are two standard digital signature
   schemes.  They provide data integrity and verifiable authenticity in
   various protocols.

   One characteristic of DSA and ECDSA is that they need to produce, for
   each signature generation, a fresh random value (hereafter designated
   as 'k').  For effective security, 'k' must be chosen randomly and
   uniformly from a set of modular integers, using a cryptographically
   secure process.  Even slight biases in that process may be turned
   into attacks on the signature schemes.

   The need for a cryptographically secure source of randomness proves
   to be a hindrance for deployment of DSA and ECDSA signature schemes
   in some architectures in which secure random number generation is
   challenging; in particular embedded systems such as smartcards.  In
   those systems, the RSA signature algorithm, used as specified in
   PKCS#1 [RFC3447] (with "type 1" padding, not PSS) and ISO 9796-2
   [ISO-9796-2], is often preferred, even though it is computationally
   more expensive, because RSA (with such padding schemes) is
   deterministic and thus does not require a source of randomness.

   The randomized nature of DSA and ECDSA also makes implementations
   harder to test.  Automatic tests cannot reliably detect whether the
   implementation uses a source of randomness of high enough quality.
   This makes the implementation process more vulnerable to catastrophic
   failures, often discovered after the system has been deployed, and
   successfully attacked.

   It is possible to turn DSA and ECDSA into deterministic schemes, by
   using a deterministic process for generating the "random" value k.
   That process must fulfill some cryptographic characteristics in order
   to maintain the properties of verifiability and unforgeability
   expected from signature schemes.  This document describes such a
   procedure.  It has the following features:

   o  Produced signatures remain fully compatible with plain DSA and
      ECDSA.  Entities which verify the signatures need not be changed
      or even be aware of the process used to generate k.

   o  Key pair generation is not altered.  Existing private keys can be
      used with deterministic DSA and ECDSA.

   o  Using deterministic DSA and ECDSA implies no extra storage
      requirement of any secret or public value.

   o  Deterministic DSA and ECDSA can be applied over the same inputs
      than plain DSA and ECDSA, namely a hash value computed over the
      message which is to be signed, with a cryptographically secure
      hash function.


2.  DSA and ECDSA Notations

   In this section, we succintly describe DSA and ECDSA, and define our
   notations.  The complete specification of DSA and ECDSA can be found
   in, respectively, [FIPS-186-3] and [X9.62].

2.1.  Key Parameters

   DSA and ECDSA work over a large group of prime size, in which the
   group operation is easy to compute, but discrete logarithm is hard.
   The definition of the group is called the "key parameters".  Key
   parameters may be shared between different key pairs with no ill
   effect on security; this is the usual case with ECDSA in particular.

   DSA uses the following key parameters:

   p    a large prime number (at least 1024 bits)

   q    a sufficiently large prime number (at least 160 bits) which is
        also a divisor of p-1

   g    a generator for the multiplicative subgroup of order q of
        integers modulo p

   The group on which DSA will be computed consists in the values
   'g^a mod p', where '^' denotes exponentiation, and 'a' ranges from 0
   to q-1 (inclusive).  The size of the group is q.

   ECDSA uses the following key parameters:

   E    an elliptic curve, defined over a given finite field

   q    a sufficiently large prime number (at least 160 bits) which is a
        divisor of the curve order

   G    a point of E, of order q

   The group on which ECDSA will be computed consists in the curve
   points 'aG' (multiplication of point G by integer 'a') where 'a'
   ranges from 0 to q-1.  G is such that qG = 0 (the "point at infinity"
   on the curve E).  The size of the group is q.  Note that these
   notations slightly differ from those described in [X9.62]; we use

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


   them in order to match those used for DSA.

2.2.  Key Pairs

   A DSA or ECDSA private key is an integer 'x' taken modulo q.  The
   relevant standards prescribe that x shall not be 0; hence, x is an
   integer in the range [1, q-1].

   A DSA or ECDSA public key is computed from the private key x, and the
   key parameters:

   o  For DSA, the public key is the integer: y = g^x mod p

   o  For ECSA, the public key is the curve point: U = xG

2.3.  Integer Conversions

   Let 'qlen' be the binary length of q. qlen is the unique integer such
   that q is greater than 2^(qlen-1) but less than 2^qlen.  This is the
   size of the binary representation of q, without a sign bit.  We
   define four conversion functions, which work on string of bits,
   octets, and integers modulo q. qlen is the main parameter for these
   conversions.

2.3.1.  Bits and Octets

   Formally, all operations are defined on sequences of bits.  A
   sequence is ordered; the first bit is said to be leftmost, while the
   last bit is rightmost.

   On most software systems, bits are grouped into octets (sequences of
   eight bits).  Binary data, e.g. the output of a hash function, is
   available as a sequence of octets.  Whenever applicable, we consider
   that bits within an octet are ordered from most significant to least
   significant: the first (leftmost) bit within an octet has numerical
   value 128, while the last (rightmost) has numerical value 1.

2.3.2.  Bit String to Integer

   The 'bits2int' transform takes as input a sequence of 'blen' bits,
   and outputs a non-negative integer which is less than 2^qlen.  It
   consists in the following steps:

   1.  The sequence is first truncated or expanded to length 'qlen':

       *  if qlen < blen, then the qlen leftmost bits are kept;
          subsequent bits are discarded;




Pornin                 Expires September 29, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


       *  otherwise, qlen-blen bits are added to the left of the
          sequence (i.e. before the input bits in the sequence order).

   2.  The resulting sequence is then converted to an integer value
       using the big-endian convention: if input bits are called b_0
       (leftmost) to b_(qlen-1) (rightmost), then the resulting value
       is:

          b_0*2^(qlen-1) + b_1*2^(qlen-2) + ... + b_(qlen-1)*2^0

   The 'bits2int' transform can also be described in the following way:
   the input bit sequence (of length blen) is transformed into an
   integer using the big-endian convention.  Then, if blen is greater
   than qlen, the resulting integer is divided by two to the power blen-
   qlen (euclidian division: the remainder is discarded); in many
   software implementations of arithmetics on big integers, that
   division is equivalent to a "right shift" by blen-qlen bits.

2.3.3.  Integer to Octet String

   An integer value x less than q (and, in particular, a value which has
   been taken modulo q) can be converted into a sequence of rlen bits,
   where rlen = 8*ceil(qlen/8).  This is the sequence of bits obtained
   by big-endian encoding.  In other words, the sequence bits x_i (for i
   ranging from 0 to rlen-1) are such that:

      x = x_0*2^(rlen-1) + x_1*2^(rlen-2) + ... + x_(rlen-1)

   We call this transform 'int2octets'.

2.3.4.  Bit String to Octet String

   The 'bits2octets' transform takes as input a sequence of 'blen' bits,
   and outputs a sequence of 'rlen' bits.  It consists in the following
   steps:

   1.  The input sequence 'b' is converted into an integer value 'z1'
       through the bits2int transform:

          z1 = bits2int(b)

   2.  z1 is reduced modulo q, yielding z2 (an integer between 0 and
       q-1, inclusive):

          z2 = z1 mod q

       Note that since z1 is less than 2^qlen, that modular reduction
       can be implemented with a simple conditional subtraction:

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


       z2 = z1-q if that value is non-negative; otherwise z2 = z1.

   3.  z2 is transformed into a sequence of octets (a sequence of rlen
       bits) by applying int2octets.

2.3.5.  Usage

   It is worth noticing that int2octets is not the reverse of bits2int,
   even for input sequences of length qlen: int2octets will add some
   bits on the left, while bits2int will discard some bits on the right.
   int2octets is the reverse of bits2int only when qlen is a multiple of
   8 and bit sequences already have length qlen.

   bits2int is used during signature generation and verification, to
   transform a hash value (computed over the input message) into an
   integer modulo q.  That is, the integer obtained through bits2int is
   further reduced modulo q; since that integer is less than 2^qlen,
   that reduction can be performed with at most one subtraction.

   int2octets is defined under the name 'Integer-to-Octet-String' in
   section 2.3.7 of SEC 1 [SEC1].  It is used in the specification of
   the encoding of an ECDSA private key (x) within an ASN.1-based
   structure.

   bits2octets is not used in standard DSA or ECDSA.  We will use it in
   the specification of deterministic (EC)DSA.

2.4.  Signature Generation

   Signature generation uses a cryptographic hash function 'H' and an
   input message 'm'.  The message is first processed by H, yielding the
   value H(m), which is a sequence of bits of length 'hlen'.  The
   following steps are then applied:

   1.  H(m) is transformed into an integer modulo q using the bits2int
       transform, and an extra modular reduction:

          h = bits2int(H(m)) mod q

       As was noted in the description of 'bits2octets', the extra
       modular reduction is no more than a conditional subtraction.

   2.  A random value modulo q, dubbed 'k', is generated.  That value
       shall not be 0; hence, it lies in the [1, q-1] range.  Most of
       the remaining of this document will revolve around the process
       used to generate k.  In plain DSA or ECDSA, k should be selected
       through a random selection which chooses a value among the q-1
       possible values with uniform probability.

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


   3.  A value 'r' (modulo q) is computed from k and the key parameters:

       *  For DSA:

             r = g^k mod p mod q

          (the exponentiation is performed modulo p, yielding a number
          between 0 and p-1, which is then further reduced modulo q).

       *  For ECDSA: the point kG is computed; its X coordinate (a
          member of the field over which E is defined) is converted to
          an integer, which is reduced modulo q, yielding r.

       If r turns out to be zero, a new k should be selected and r
       computed again (this is an utterly improbable occurrence).

   4.  The value 's' (modulo q) is computed:

          s = (h+x*r)/k mod q

       The pair '(r, s)' is the signature.  How a signature is to be
       encoded is not covered by the DSA and ECDSA standards themselves;
       a common way is to use a DER-encoded ASN.1 structure (a SEQUENCE
       of two INTEGERs, for r and s, in that order).


3.  Deterministic DSA and ECDSA

   "Deterministic DSA (respectively ECDSA)" is the process of generating
   a DSA (resp. ECDSA) signature, over an input message m, by using the
   standard DSA (resp. ECDSA) signature generation process (recalled in
   the previous section), except that the value k, instead of being
   randomly generated, is obtained through the process described in this
   section.

   We use the notations described in Section 2.

3.1.  Building Blocks

3.1.1.  HMAC

   HMAC [RFC2104] is a construction of a Message Authentication Code
   using a hash function and a secret key.  We use here HMAC with the
   same hash function H than the one used to process the input message
   prior to signature generation or verification.

   We denote the process of applying HMAC with key 'K' over data 'V' by:

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


      HMAC_K(V)

   which returns a sequence of bits of length hlen (the output length of
   the underlying hash function H).

3.2.  Generation of k

   Given the input message 'm', the following process is applied:

   a.  Process m through the hash function H, yielding:

          h1 = H(m)

       (h1 is a sequence of hlen bits).

   b.  Set:

          V = 0x01 0x01 0x01 ... 0x01

       such that the length of V, in bits, is equal to 8*ceil(hlen/8).
       For instance, on an octet-based system, if H is SHA-256, then V
       is set to a sequence of 32 octets of value 1.

   c.  Set:

          K = 0x00 0x00 0x00 ... 0x00

       such that the length of K, in bits, is equal to 8*ceil(hlen/8).

   d.  Set:

          K = HMAC_K(V || 0x00 || int2octets(x) || bits2octets(h1))

       where '||' denotes concatenation.  In other words, we compute
       HMAC with key K, over the concatenation of, in that order, the
       current value of V, a sequence of eight bits of value 0, the
       encoding of the (EC)DSA private key x, and the hashed message
       (possibly truncated and extended as specified by the bits2octets
       transform).  The HMAC result is the new value of K.

   e.  Set:

          V = HMAC_K(V)

   f.  Set:

          K = HMAC_K(V || 0x01 || int2octets(x) || bits2octets(h1))

       Note that the 'internal octet' is 0x01 this time.

   g.  Set:

          V = HMAC_K(V)

   h.  Apply the following algorithm until a proper value is found for
       k:

       A.  Set T to the empty sequence.  The length of T (in bits) is
           denoted 'tlen'; thus, at that point, tlen = 0.

       B.  While tlen < qlen, do the following:

              V = HMAC_K(V)

              T = T || V

       C.  Compute:

              k = bits2int(T)

           If that value of k is within the [1,q-1] range, then the
           generation of k is finished.  The obtained value of k is used
           in DSA or ECDSA.  Otherwise, compute:

              K = HMAC_K(V || 0x00)

              V = HMAC_K(V)

           and loop (try to generate a new T, and so on).

   Please note that when k is generated from T, the result of bits2int
   is compared to q, not reduced modulo q.  If the value is not between
   1 and q-1, the process loops.  Performing a simple modular reduction
   would induce biases which would be detrimental to signature security.

3.3.  Alternate Description of the Generation of k

   The process described in the previous section is actually derived
   from the "HMAC_DRBG" pseudo-random number generator, described in
   [SP800-90] and annex D of [X9.62].  Using the terminology from
   [SP800-90], the generation of k can be described as such:

   a.  Instantiate HMAC_DRBG using HMAC parameterized with the same hash
       function H than the one used for processing the message which is
       to be signed.  Instantiation parameters are:




Pornin                 Expires September 29, 2011              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


       requested_instantiation_security_strength
          Set this parameter to any value that the HMAC_DRBG
          implementation will accept, when using H as base hash
          function.

       prediction_resistance_flag
          Set this parameter to "false".

       personalization_string
          Set this parameter to "Null" (the empty bit sequence).

       entropy_input
          Use int2octets(x) as entropy string.

       nonce
          Use bits2octets(H(m)) as nonce.

       Note that the last two parameters are not parameters to the
       HMAC_DRBG instantiation function per se; instead, those values
       are requested from the internal Get_entropy_input function during
       instantiation.  For deterministic (EC)DSA, we want HMAC_DRBG to
       run with the entropy string and nonce that we specify, without
       accessing an actual entropy source.

   b.  Generate a candidate value for k by requesting qlen bits from
       HMAC_DRBG, and converting the resulting bits into an integer with
       the bits2int transform.  Repeat this step until a value is
       obtained, which is non-zero but less than q.

   Note that we instantiate a new HMAC_DRBG instance for each signature
   generation process.  There is no "personalization string", and no
   "additional input" when generating bits.  The reseed function of
   HMAC_DRBG is never invoked, neither externally nor as a consequence
   of the internal HMAC_DRBG processing.

   As shown above, we use the encoding of the private key as "entropy
   string" and the hashed message (truncated and expanded by
   bits2octets) as "nonce".  In HMAC_DRBG, the entropy string and nonce
   are simply concatenated into the initial seed, hence the split
   between "entropy" and "nonce" is quite arbitrary.  Using qlen bits
   for each ought to be compatible with most HMAC_DRBG implementation
   input requirements.

3.4.  Usage Notes

   With DSA or ECDSA, the value 'k' is used to compute the first half of
   the signature, dubbed 'r'.  This is a number modulo q.  The DSA and
   ECDSA standards mandate that, if 'r' is zero, then a new k should be



Pornin                 Expires September 29, 2011              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


   selected.  With a deterministic process for the generation of k, such
   a loop would never exit.

   Fortunately, finding an input message which would lead to a null 'r'
   appears to be exceedingly difficult; in fact, it seems to require
   more computational effort than breaking the signature scheme, even
   with knowledge of the private key.  Therefore, this situation does
   not arise in practice.  Implementers may replace a null 'r' by a
   conventional value (e.g. 1), or let the zero pass; this is a purely
   cosmetic decision since such a code path will not be triggered
   anyway.

3.5.  Rationale

   The process described in the previous sections mimics the "Approved"
   generation process of k described in annex D of [X9.62], with the
   "HMAC_DRBG" pseudo-random number generator.  The main difference is
   that we use the concatenation of the private key x and the hashed
   message H(m) as the PRNG seed.  If using a "security level" of n
   bits, then HMAC_DRBG should be used with seed entropy at least n+64
   bits; however, the key x should also have been generated with that
   much entropy, and the length of x is qlen, which is at least equal to
   2*n and thus larger than n+64 (DSA and ECDSA, as specified by the
   standards, require qlen >= 160).  It can then be argued that
   deterministic ECDSA fulfills the entropy requirements of annex D of
   [X9.62].

   We use bits2octets(H(m)) instead of H(m) in order to ease
   integration.  Indeed, many existing signature systems offload the
   message hashing; the signature engine (which has access to the
   private key) receives only H(m).  In some applications, where data
   bandwidth is constrained, only the first qlen bits of H(m) are
   transferred to the signature engine, on the basis that the bits2int
   transform will ignore subsequent bits anyway.  Possibly, in some
   systems, the truncated H(m) could be externally reduced modulo q,
   since that is the first thing that (EC)DSA performs on the hashed
   message.  With the definition of bits2octets, deterministic (EC)DSA
   can be applied with the same input.

3.6.  Variants

   Many parts of the specification of deterministic (EC)DSA are quite
   arbitrary.  It is possible to define variants which are NOT
   "deterministic (EC)DSA" (and thus cannot be verified with the test
   vector listed in this document), but which may nonetheless be useful
   in some contexts:





Pornin                 Expires September 29, 2011              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


   o  It is possible to use H(m) directly, instead of bits2octets(H(m)),
      as part of the HMAC input.

   o  Additional data may be added to the input of HMAC, concatenated
      after 'bits2octets(H(m))':

         K = HMAC_K(V || 0x00 || int2octets(x) || bits2octets(h1) || k')

      A use case may be a protocol which requires a non-deterministic
      signature algorithm, on a system which does not have access to a
      high quality random source.  It suffices that the additional data
      k' is non-repeating (e.g. a signature counter, or a monotonic
      clock) to ensure "random-looking" signatures indistinguishable, in
      a cryptographic way, from plain (EC)DSA signatures.  In [SP800-90]
      terminology, "k'" is the "additional input" which can be set as
      parameter when generating pseudo-random bits.

   o  Instead of using x (the private key) as input to HMAC, it is
      possible to use an additional secret data, stored along the
      private key with the same security measures.  The entropy of that
      additional data SHALL be at least n bits, preferably n+64 bits or
      more, where 'n' is the target security level.

   o  In this document, we use the same hash function H for processing
      the input message, and as parameter to HMAC.  Two distinct hash
      functions could be used, provided that both are adequately secure.

5.  Security Considerations

   Proper implementation and usage of a cryptographic signature
   algorithm requires taking into account many parameters.  In
   particular, private key generation, storage, access control and
   disposal are sensitive operations, which this document does not
   address in any way.  What deterministic (EC)DSA does is that it shows
   how to achieve the security characteristics of a standard DSA or
   ECDSA signature scheme while removing the need for a source of strong
   randomness, or even any source of randomness, during signature
   generation.  Private key generation, however, absolutely requires
   such a source.

   Removal of the random source requirement, and ability to test an
   implementation against test vectors, both enhance security of DSA and



Pornin                 Expires September 29, 2011              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


   ECDSA signer implementations, in that they help avoid hard-to-test
   failure conditions.  Deterministic signature schemes may also help in
   other situations, e.g. to avoid spurious duplicates, when the same
   data element is signed several times with the same key: with a
   deterministic signature scheme, the same signature is generated every
   time, making duplicate detection much easier.

   Conversely, lack of randomization may have adverse effects in some
   advanced protocols, e.g. related to anonymity in some voting schemes.
   As a rule of thumb, deterministic DSA or ECDSA can be used in lieu of
   the genuine DSA or ECDSA, with no additional security issue, if the
   overall protocol would tolerate another deterministic signature
   scheme, in particular RSA as specified in PKCS#1 [RFC3447] (with
   "type 1" padding, not PSS) or ISO 9796-2 [ISO-9796-2].  The list of
   protocols in which deterministic DSA or ECDSA is appropriate includes
   TLS [RFC5246], SSH [RFC4251], CMS [RFC5652] and derivatives, X.509
   public key infrastructures [RFC5280], and many others.

   The construction described in this document is known as a
   'derandomization'.  This has been proposed for various signature
   schemes.  Security relies on whether the generation of 'k' is
   indistinguishable from the output of a Random Oracle.  Roughly
   speaking, HMAC_DRBG is secure in that role as long as HMAC behaves as
   a PRF (Pseudo-Random Function).  For details, please refer to
   [LN2009], [H2008] and [B2006].

Appendix A.  Examples

A.1.  Detailed Example

   We detail here the intermediate values obtained during the generation
   of k on an example message and key.  We use a binary curve because
   that specific curve is standard, and has a group order length (qlen)
   which is not a multiple of 8; this illustrates the fine details of
   how conversions are performed between integers and bit sequences.

A.1.1.  Key Pair

   We consider ECDSA on the curve K-163 described in [FIPS-186-3] (also
   known as "ansix9t163k1" in [X9.62]).  The curve is defined over a
   field GF(2^163): field elements are encoded into 163-bit strings.
   The order of the conventional base point is the prime value:

      q = 0x4000000000000000000020108A2E0CC0D99F8A5EF

   which has length qlen = 163 bits.

   Our private key is:

      x = 0x09A4D6792295A7F730FC3F2B49CBC0F62E862272F

   The corresponding public key is the curve point U = xG.  This point
   has two coordinates, which are elements of the field GF(2^163).
   These elements can be converted to integers using the procedure
   described in section A.5.6 of [X9.62], yielding the two public point
   coordinates:

      Ux = 0x79AEE090DB05EC252D5CB4452F356BE198A4FF96F

      Uy = 0x782E29634DDC9A31EF40386E896BAA18B53AFA5A3

A.1.2.  Generation of k

   In this example, we use the hash function SHA-256 [FIPS-180-3].  The
   input message is the UTF-8 encoding of the string "sample" (6 octets,
   i.e. 48 bits).

   The hashed input message h1 = SHA-256(m) is:

   h1
      AF 2B DB E1 AA 9B 6E C1 E2 AD E1 D6 94 F4 1F C7
      1A 83 1D 02 68 E9 89 15 62 11 3D 8A 62 AD D1 BF

   (32 octets, each octet value is listed in hexadecimal notation).

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


   We convert the private key x to a sequence of octets using the
   int2octets transform:

   int2octets(x)
      00 9A 4D 67 92 29 5A 7F 73 0F C3 F2 B4 9C BC 0F
      62 E8 62 27 2F

   Note: although the specific value of x would numerically fit in 160
   bits, i.e. 20 octets, we still encode x into 21 octets, because the
   encoding length is driven by the length of q, which is 163 bits.

   We also truncate and/or expand the hashed message using bits2octets:

   bits2octets(h1)
      01 79 5E DF 0D 54 DB 76 0F 15 6D 0D AC 04 C0 32
      2B 3A 20 42 24

   The steps b to g then compute the values for the K and V variables.
   These variables are sequences of 256 bits (the hash function output
   length, rounded up to a multiple of 8).  We reproduce here the
   successive values:

   V after step b:
      01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01
      01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01

   K after step c:
      00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
      00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

   K after step d:

   V after step e:
      D5 F4 03 0F 75 5E E8 6A A1 0B BA 8C 09 DF 11 4F
      F6 B6 11 1C 23 85 00 D1 3C 73 43 A8 C0 1B EC F7

   K after step f:
      0C F2 FE 96 D5 61 9C 9E F5 3C B7 41 7D 49 D3 7E
      A6 8A 4F FE D0 D7 E6 23 E3 86 89 28 99 11 BD 57

      8E D9 CD 92 5D 8E 96 4C E0 76 4D EF 3F 84 2B 9A

   In step h, we perform the final loop.  Since we use HMAC with SHA-
   256, which produces 256 bits worth of output, and we need only 163

   bits for T, a single HMAC invocation yields the following T:

   T (first try)
      93 05 A4 6D E7 FF 8E B1 07 19 4D EB D3 FD 48 AA
      20 D5 E7 65 6C BE 0E A6 9D 2A 8D 4E 7C 67 31 4A

   which, when converted to an integer with bits2int, yields a first
   candidate for k:

      k1 = 0x4982D236F3FFC758838CA6F5E9FEA455106AF3B2B

   Since that value is greater than q-1, we have to loop.  This first
   entails computing new values for K and V:

   new K
      75 CB 5C 05 B2 A7 8C 3D 81 DF 12 D7 4D 7B E0 A0
      E9 4A B1 98 15 78 1D 4D 8E 29 02 A7 9D 0A 66 99

      C9 12 D8 35 EA DD C3 05 F2 44 5D 88 F6 6C 4C 43

   then a new T:

   T (second try)
      C7 0C 78 60 8A 3B 5B E9 28 9B E9 0E F6 E8 1A 9E
      2C 15 16 D5 75 1D 2F 75 F5 00 33 E4 5F 73 BD EB

   and a new candidate for k:

      k2 = 0x63863C30451DADF4944DF4877B740D4F160A8B6AB

   Since k2 is also greater than q-1, we loop again:

   new K (2)
      0A 5A 64 B9 9C 05 95 20 10 36 86 CB 6F 36 BC FC
      A7 88 EB 3B CF 69 BA 66 A5 BB 08 0B 05 93 BA 53

   new V (2)

      FD 72 5F 17 CA 34 30 E8 72 14 53 E5 55 50 A1 8F

   T (third try)

      BC D7 BB 03 63 8E 9C 46 56 A0 6F 37 F6 50 8A 7C

   and we finally get an acceptable value for k:

      k = 0x23AF4074C90A02B3FE61D286D5C87F425E6BDD81B

A.1.3.  signature

   With our private key, and the value of k which we just generated, we
   can now compute the signature using the standard ECDSA mechanisms.
   First, the point kG is computed, and the X coordinate of that point
   is converted to an integer, and then reduced modulo q, yielding the
   first signature half:

      r = 0x113A63990598A3828C407C0F4D2438D990DF99A7F

   which we use, together with x (the private key), k (which we computed
   above) and h = bits2int(h1), to compute the second signature half:

      s = 0x1313A2E03F5412DDB296A22E2C455335545672D9F

   An ECDSA signature is a pair of integers.  In many protocols which
   require a signature to be a sequence of bits (or octets), it is
   customary to encode the signature as an ASN.1 SEQUENCE of two INTEGER
   values, with DER rules.  This results in the following 48-octet
   signature:

      30 2E 02 15 01 13 A6 39 90 59 8A 38 28 C4 07 C0
      F4 D2 43 8D 99 0D F9 9A 7F 02 15 01 31 3A 2E 03
      F5 41 2D DB 29 6A 22 E2 C4 55 33 55 45 67 2D 9F

A.2.  Test Vectors

   In the following sections, we give test vectors for various key sizes
   and hash functions, both for DSA and ECDSA.

   All numbers are given in hexadecimal notation.  Each signature
   consists in two integers, named 'r' and 's'; many implementations
   will encode those integers into a single ASN.1 structure, or with
   some other encoding convention, which is outside of the scope of this
   document.  We also show the 'k' value used internally.

   For every key, we list eight signatures, corresponding to two
   distinct input messages, and four of the SHA [FIPS-180-3] functions:
   SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256 and SHA-512.  The two input messages are the
   UTF-8 encoding of the strings "sample" and "test" (without the
   quotes), of length 48 and 32 bits, respectively.

   The ECDSA examples use the standard curves described in [FIPS-186-3].

Internet-Draft         Deterministic DSA and ECDSA            March 2011


A.3.  Sample Code

   We include here a sample implementation of deterministic DSA.  It is
   meant for illustration purposes; for instance, this code makes no
   attempt at avoiding side-channel leakage of the private key.  It is
   written in the Java programming language.  The actual generation of
   the "random" value k is done in the computek() method.  The Java
   virtual machine is assumed to provide the implementation of the hash
   function and of HMAC.

   // ==================================================================

   import java.math.BigInteger;
   import java.security.InvalidKeyException;
   import java.security.MessageDigest;
   import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
   import javax.crypto.Mac;
   import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

   /**
    * <p>Deterministic DSA signature generation. This is a sample
    * implementation designed to illustrate how deterministic DSA
    * chooses the pseudo-random value k when signing a given message.
    * This implementation was NOT optimized or hardened against
    * side-channel leaks.</p>
    *
    * <p>An instance is created with a hash function name, which must be
    * supported by the underlying Java virtual machine ("SHA-1" and
    * "SHA-256" should work everywhere). The data to sign is input
    * through the {@code update()} methods. The private key is set with
    * {@link #setPrivateKey}. The signature is obtained by calling
    * {@link #sign}; alternatively, {@link #signHash} can be used to
    * sign some data which has been externally hashed. The private key
    * MUST be set before generating the signature itself, but message
    * data can be input before setting the key.</p>
    *
    * <p>Instances are NOT thread-safe. However, once a signature has
    * been generated, the same instance can be used again for another
    * signature; {@link #setPrivateKey} needs not be called again if the
    * private key has not changed. {@link #reset} can also be called to
    * cancel previously input data. Generating a signature with {@link
    * #sign} (not {@link #signHash}) also implicitely causes a
    * reset.</p>

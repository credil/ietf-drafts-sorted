Abstract

   This document specifies the procedure for creating bindings between a
   DHCPv4 [RFC2131]/DHCPv6 [RFC3315] assigned source IP address and an
   anchor (refer to [SAVI-framework]) on SAVI (Source Address Validation
   Improvements) device. The bindings can be used to filter packets with
   forged IP addresses generated on the local link.

1. Introduction

   This document describes the procedure for creating bindings between
   DHCP assigned addresses and an anchor (refer to [savi-framework]).
   Other related details about this procedure are also specified in this
   document.

   These bindings can be used to filter packets with forged IP addresses.
   How to use these bindings is specified in [savi-framework], depending
   on the environment and configuration. The definition and examples of
   anchor is also specified in [savi-framework].

   The binding process is inspired by the work of IP source guard. This
   specification differs from IP source guard in the specification for

   collision detection, which is quite useful in an environment with
   multiple address assignment methods.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Mechanism Overview

   The mechanism specified in this document is designed to provide a
   host level source IP address validation granularity, as a supplement
   to BCP38 [BCP38]. This mechanism is deployed on the access device
   (including access switch, wireless access point/controller, etc), and
   performs mainly DHCPv4/v6 snooping to set up bindings between DHCP
   assigned IP address and corresponding anchors. The bindings can be
   used to validate the source address in the packets.

4. Background and Related Protocols

   This mechanism is an instance of a SAVI [savi-framework] solution,
   specialized for addresses assigned using the DHCP protocol.

   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 [RFC2131] and Dynamic
   Host Configuration Protocol version 6 [RFC3315] specify the
   procedures for providing a client with assigned address and other
   configuration information from a DHCP server. If a client gets an
   address through the DHCP protocol, the address should be regarded as
   a potential "authorized" or "registered" address of the client.

   In IPv6, IPv6 Stateless Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] is used as
   another address assignment mechanism. A node can use this mechanism
   to auto-configure an IPv6 address. A DHCPv6 client may use a
   stateless address to send message to DHCP server. Even in a DHCPv6-
   only environment, a node must assign its link-local address through
   this mechanism. [RFC4862] also clearly requires that duplicated
   address detection must be performed on any IPv6 address, including
   DHCPv6 address.

   [RFC4861] specifies the Neighbor Discovery protocol, which is an
   essential part of IPv6 address assignment.

   [RFC5227] specifies the procedure to detect IPv4 address collision.
   It is not required currently. However, this feature is useful to
   determine the uniqueness of an IPv4 address on the link.

5. Terminology

   The terms used in this document are described in [savi-framework],
   [RFC2131] and [RFC3315].

6. Conceptual Data Structures

   (To be removed and merged with data structures used by other
   mechanisms in [savi-framework] if possible)

   This section describes the possible conceptual data structures used
   in this mechanism.

   Two main data structures are used to record bindings and their states
   respectively. There is redundancy between the two structures, for the
   consideration of separation of data plane and control plane.

6.1.  Binding State Table (BST)

   This table contains the state of binding between source address and
   anchor. Entries are keyed on the anchor and source IP address. Each
   entry has a lifetime field recording the remaining lifetime of the
   entry, a state field recording the state of the binding and a field
   for recording other information.

             +---------+----------+-------+-----------+-------+
             | Anchor  | Address  | State | Lifetime  |Other  |
             +---------+----------+-------+-----------+-------+
             | A       | IP_1     | Bound |  65535    |       |
             +---------+----------+-------+-----------+-------+
             | A       | IP_2     | Bound |  10000    |       |
             +---------+----------+-------+-----------+-------+
             | B       | IP_3     |_Start |      1    |       |
             +---------+----------+-------+-----------+-------+
                         Figure 1 Instance of BST


6.2.  Filtering Table (FT)

   This table contains the bindings between anchor and address, keyed on
   anchor. This table doesn't contain any state of the binding. This
   table is only used to filter packets. An Access Control List can be
   regarded as a practical instance of this table.

7. Binding States Description

   This section describes the binding states of this mechanism.

   START        A DHCP request (or a DHCPv6 Confirm) has been received
   from host, and it may trigger a new binding.

   LIVE       A DHCP address has been acknowledged by a DHCP server.

   DETECTION    A gratuitous ARP or Duplicate Address Detection NSOL
   has been sent by the host (or the SAVI device).

   BOUND       The address has passed duplicate detection and
             it is bound with the anchor.

8. DHCP Scenario

   (This section should be removed and merged with other scenarios in
   [savi-framework])

   This section specifies the deployment scenarios of this mechanism.

9. Anchor Attributes

   This section specifies the anchor attributes involved in this
   mechanism.

9.1. SAVI-Host Attribute

    (This attribute should be described in the [savi-framework])

   If and only if an anchor is exclusively associated with a single host,
   this anchor can be set to have SAVI-Host attribute.

9.2. SAVI-Poly Attribute

   (This attribute should be described in the [savi-framework])

   If an anchor is associated with a small number of hosts through a
   converged device, this anchor can be set to have the SAVI-Poly
   attribute. The SAVI-Poly attribute is mutually exclusive with the
   SAVI-Host attribute.

   The main difference in process on an anchor with the SAVI-Poly
   attribute from one with the SAVI-Host attribute is the policy of
   binding consistency.

9.3. SAVI-DHCP-Trust Attribute

   If and only if an anchor is associated with a trustable DHCP
   server/relay, it can be set to have this attribute.


Bi                      Expires May 9, 2010                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                savi-dhcp                  November 2009


   If DHCP is used to assign address in the network, there MUST be at
   least one anchor with this attribute. DHCP Reply message not coming
   from such ports MUST be dropped.

9.4. SAVI-RA-Trust Attribute

   (This attribute should be described in the [savi-framework])

   If and only if an anchor is associated with a trustable router, it
   can be set to have this attribute.

   There MAY be no SAVI-RA-Trust anchor on a SAVI device.

   Router Advertisement not received from a SAVI-RA-Trust anchor MUST be
   discarded.

9.5. SAVI-SAVI Attribute

   (This attribute should be described in the [savi-framework])

   If and only if an anchor is associated with another SAVI device, it
   can be set to have this attribute.

   This attribute is mutually exclusive with SAVI-Host and SAVI-Poly
   attribute.

10. Prefix Configuration

   (This section should be included in [SAVI-framework] but not this
   document.)

   Before setting up a host-level granularity binding table, it is
   important to configure correct prefixes on the SAVI device. At least
   two prefix scopes must be set: the IPv4 prefix and IPv6 prefixes.
   This document suggests set 3 prefix scopes:

  IPv4 Prefix:

         The allowed scope of any kind of IPv4 addresses. It can be set
         manually.

   IPv6 SLAAC Prefixes:

         The allowed scope of SLAAC and manually configured IPv6
         addresses. It can be set through snooping RA message from port
         with SAVI-RA-Trust attribute, or manual configuration.

Internet-Draft                savi-dhcp                  November 2009


         FE80::/64 MUST be set to a feasible prefix.

   IPv6 DHCPv6 Prefixes:

         The allowed scope of DHCPv6 addresses. It can be set through RA
         snooping, DHCP-PD protocol, or manual configuration.

   If some of the prefix scope is set to have non prefix, it implies
   corresponding address assignment method is not allowed in the network.

   There is no need to explicitly present these prefix scopes. But these
   restrictions MUST be used as premier check in binding set up.

   Refer to security consideration for other discussions.

11. Binding Set Up

   This section specifies the procedure of setting up bindings based on
   control packet snooping.

11.1. Process of DHCP Snooping

11.1.1. Initialization

   This procedure will not be performed if:

   1. Option 82 is used to keep anchor in DHCP Request and Reply, or

   2. Unspoofable MAC is used as anchor(802.11i,802.1ae/af), or

   3. The mapping table from MAC to anchor is secure.

   If none of these three requirements are satisfied, this procedure
   MUST be performed.

11.1.1.1. Trigger Event

   A DHCPv4/v6 Request or a DHCPv6 Confirm is received with an anchor
   which has the attribute of SAVI-Host or SAVI-Poly.

11.1.1.2. Message Validation

   The SAVI device checks the Request or Confirm as follows:

   1. Whether the limitation on binding entry number of this anchor will
      be exceeded.

Internet-Draft                savi-dhcp                  November 2009


11.1.1.3. Following Actions

   Forward the REQUEST message if binding entry limitation will not be
   exceeded.

   Generate an entry in the Binding State Table (BST) and set the state
   field to START. The lifetime of this entry is set to be
   MAX_DHCP_RESPONSE_TIME. The Transaction ID (Refer to Section 2 in
   [RFC2131] and Section 4.2 in [RFC3315]) field of the request packet
   is also recorded in the entry.

   +---------+----------+-------+-----------------------+-------+
   | Anchor  | Address  | State | Lifetime              |Other  |
   +---------+----------+-------+-----------------------+-------+
   | A       |          | Start |MAX_DHCP_RESPONSE_TIME | TID   |
   +---------+----------+-------+-----------------------+-------+
              Figure 4 Binding entry in BST on initialization

   The TID is kept for assurance that the response from the DHCP server
   can be delivered to the request host. This is left as an open issue
   for future discussion.

11.1.2. From START to LIVE

11.1.2.1. Trigger Event

   A DHCPv4 DHCPACK or DHCPv6 REPLY message is received.

11.1.2.2. Message Validation

   The SAVI device checks the message as follows:

   1. Whether the message is received with an anchor which has the SAVI-
      DHCP-Trust attribute;

   2. Whether the entry in the BST with corresponding TID is in the
      START state.

11.1.2.3. Following Actions

   Deliver the message to the destination.

   Set the state of the corresponding entry to be LIVE. The lifetime of
   the entry is set to be MAX_ARP_PREPARE_DELAY or MAX_DAD_PREPARE_DELAY

12. Filtering Specification

   This section specifies how to use bindings to filter packets.

12.1. Filter Data Packet

   Data packets with an anchor which has attribute SAVI-Host or SAVI-
   Poly are filtered. There can be an anchor with neither attribute.




Bi                      Expires May 9, 2010                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                savi-dhcp                  November 2009


   If the source of a packet associated with its anchor is in the FT,
   this packet will be forwarded; or else the packet MUST be discarded.

12.2. Filter Control Packet

   The source address of DHCPv4 Request/Discovery must be set to all
   zeros.

   The source address of DHCPv6 Request/Confirm must be an address
   associated with the corresponding anchor in FT.

   The source address of IPv6 NS and IPv6 gratuitous ARP must pass the
   check on FT. The source address of DAD NS MUST be unspecified address.

   All DHCP Reply/Ack packets MUST be from an anchor with the SAVI-DHCP-
   Trust attribute.

   The target address and source address in all the Neighbor
   Advertisement packets and ARP replies must also pass the checks on FT,
   if they are associated with anchors which have SAVI-Host or SAVI-Poly
   attribute.

13. Format and Delivery of Probe Messages

   1. Duplicate detection on behavior of host;

      Message Type: DAD NS, Gratuitous ARP Request

      Format:

                   Link layer source - link layer address of host;

                   Link layer destination - For IPv6, use multicast address
      specified in [RFC3307]; For IPv4, use broadcast address;

                   IP source - Unspecified address for IPv6; The tentative address
      for IPv4;

                   IP destination - For IPv6, multicast address specified in
      section 5.4.2 of [RFC4861]; For IPv4, the tentative address;

      Delivery:

         MUST not deliver to the host which the SAVI device is
      performing DAD on behavior of.

Internet-Draft                savi-dhcp                  November 2009


   2. Send reply on behavior of host to hold bound address for inactive
      node;

      Message Type: NA, ARP Response

      Link layer source - link layer address of host;

      Link layer destination - The source address of the detecting node;

      IP source - The target address in the detection message;

      IP destination -The source address of the detecting node;

   3. Send probe to detect whether an address is still in use (generally
      in case of port down/up event).

      Message Type: NUD, ARP Request

      Link layer source - link layer address of the SAVI device;

      Link layer destination - The link layer address of the node;

      IP source - The manage IP address of the SAVI device;

      IP destination - The address is suspicious to be inactive.

14. Data packet trigger on SAVI-Poly anchor

   To handle the case of movement from one SAVI-Poly port to another,
   data packet based binding MUST be performed on SAVI-Poly anchor.

   Whenever a packet with source address not bound locally is received
   from a SAVI-Poly anchor, the SAVI device MUST send a DHCP CONFIRM to
   the DHCP server to ensure the address can be used on the link; if the
   address can be used, the SAVI device MUST send a DAD NS on behavior
   of the host to check the uniqueness of the address. If the address
   passes these two checks, it can be bound with the anchor.

   Data packet triggered binging will cause heavy burden and
   unpredictable danger on the SAVI device. It is not suggested to
   configure SAVI-Poly anchor and allow mobility between SAVI-Poly
   anchors. If this function is turned off, the administrator must be
   aware of the packets from SAVI-Poly anchor may be filtered
   incorrectly after movement.

Internet-Draft                savi-dhcp                  November 2009


15. Binding Remove

   If the lifetime of an entry with state BOUND expires, the entry MUST
   be removed.

   When the SAVI device receives a DAD NS/Gra ARP request target at an
   address bound and there is no reply from the anchor, if the anchor is
   a SAVI-Host anchor, hold the binding entry through sending NA/ARP
   Reply; if the anchor is a SAVI-Poly anchor, remove this binding or
   hold it.

16. Handle port DOWN event

   Whenever a port with attribute SAVI-Poly or SAVI-Host turns down, the
   bindings with the anchor MUST be kept for a short time.

   To handle movement, if receiving DAD NS/Gra ARP request target at the
   address during the period, remove the entry.

   If port turns UP during the period:

        ?Optionally send probes to SAVI-host port for assurance;

        ?MUST send probes to SAVI-Poly port for assurance.

17. About Collision in Detection

   The SAVI device may receive a response in detection. Some related
   details are specified here.

17.1. Whether to notify the DHCP server

   It is unnecessary for the SAVI device to notify the DHCP server,
   because the host will send a DECLINE message to it once it finds the
   advertised address is conflict.

17.2. The result of detection without host aware

   In case the SAVI device send detection packet instead of the host,
   the host will not be aware of the detection result. If the detection
   succeeds, there is no problem. However, if the detection fails, the
   packets from the host with the assigned address will be filtered out.
   This result can be regarded as a reasonable punishment for not
   performing duplicate detection and using a collision address.

Internet-Draft                savi-dhcp                  November 2009


18. Filtering during detection

   In this mechanism, whenever the DHCP server replies an address, this
   address will be allowed immediately even before duplicate detection
   is completed. This design is in consideration of a host may start to
   send packets straightway without detection. Also this design is to be
   compatible with optimistic DAD [RFC4429].

   However, this feature may allow an attacker to send quantities of
   packets with source addresses already assigned to other nodes. A
   practical solution for this vulnerability is configuring the address
   pool and allocation algorithm of the DHCP server carefully.

19. Binding Number Limitation

   It is suggested to configure some mechanism in order to prevent a
   single node from exhausting the binding table entries on the SAVI
   device. Either of the following mechanism is sufficient to prevent
   such attack.

   1. Set the upper bound of binding number for each anchor with SAVI-
      Host or SAVI-Poly attribute.

   2. Reserve a number of binding entries for each anchor with SAVI-Host
      or SAVI-Poly attribute and all anchors share a pool of the other
      binding entries.

   3. Limit DHCP Request rate per anchor, using the bound entry number
      of each anchor as reverse indicator.

20. MLD Consideration

   The SAVI device MUST join the tentative address multicast group
   whenever perform duplicate detection on behavior of host.

22. Summary of to-be-removed sections and open issues

   To-be-removed sections:

   1. Section 6: Conceptual data structures

   2. Section 8: DHCP scenario

   3. Part of Section 9: Anchor attributes

   4. Section 10: Prefix configuration

   Open issues (discussed but not finished):

   1. Whether to keep state START

      Should the procedure be initialized based on client request or
      server response?

      From Eric Levy-Abegnoli and Christian Vogt.

   2. Whether to keep state DETECTION

      Should DHCP interact with NDP to detect collision or should all
      the collision detection be left to NDP and the DHCP solution just
      snoop DHCP only?

      From Eric Levy-Abegnoli.

23. Security Considerations

   For prefix level granularity filtering is the basis of host level
   granularity filtering, to learn and configure correct prefix is of
   great importance to this mechanism. Thus, it's important to keep RA
   and DHCP-PD secure. [draft-ietf-v6ops-ra-guard-03] describes a
   mechanism to improve the security of RA message.

24. IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration currently.

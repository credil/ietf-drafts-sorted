            IPv6 AF Extensions for Route Target Distribution
            draft-keyur-bgp-af-specific-rt-constrain-01.txt

Abstract

   The current route target distribution specification described in
   RFC4684 defines Route Target NLRIs of maxiumum length of 12 bytes.
   The IPv6 specific Route Target extended community is defined in
   RFC5701 as length of 20 bytes.  Since the current specification only
   supports prefixes of maximum length of 12 bytes, the lack of an IPv6
   specific Route Target reachability information may be a problem when
   an operator wants to use this application in a pure IPv6 environment.
   This document defines an extension that allows BGP to exchange longer
   length IPv6 Route Target prefixes.

Internet-Draft   IPv6 AF Extensions for RT Distribution       March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The current constrained route distribution specification defined in
   [RFC4684] supports prefixes with a fixed maximum length of 12 bytes.
   The prefix length needs to be extended to support the IPv6 specific
   Route Target extended community defined in [RFC5701] which is 20
   bytes in length.

   This document defines an extension to the current constrained route
   distribution specification that allows BGP speakers to distribute
   longer length Route Target prefixes.  A new BGP capability known as
   BGP IPv6 Constrained Route Target capabiltiy is defined as part of
   extension that allows an exchange of longer length Route Target
   prefixes.  BGP speakers that do not exchange this capability MUST use
   Route Target NLRIs of maximum length of 12 bytes.  In this way, the
   current extension would preserve the backward compatibility with
   [RFC4684].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  BGP IPV6 Constrained Route Target Capability

   The "BGP IPV6 Constrained Route Target Capability" is a new BGP
   capability [RFC5492].  The Capability code for this capability is
   specified in the IANA Considersations section of this document.  The
   Capability length field of this capability is zero.

   By advertising this capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys to
   the peer that the speaker support the longer length Route Target
   prefixes and the related procedures described in this document.


3.  IPV6 Constrained Route Target NLRI Advertisements

   Route Target membership NLRI is advertised in BGP UPDATE messages
   using the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes as defined in
   [RFC4760].  The NLRI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI
   is a prefix of 0 to 24 octets, encoded as defined in Section 4 of [5]
   for all the constrain route distribution.

   This prefix is structured as follows:

           +-------------------------------+
           | origin as        (4 octets)   |
           +-------------------------------+
           | route target  (8 or 20 octets)|
           ~                               ~
           |                               |
           +-------------------------------+

   Except for the default route target, which is encoded as a zero-
   length prefix, the minimum prefix length is 32 bits.

   Route targets can then be expressed as prefixes, where, for instance,
   a prefix would encompass all route target extended communities
   assigned by a given Global Administrator [6].  Alternatively, route
   target prefixes could be aggregated however if done so, then only the
   Local Administrator field of the Route Target can be aggregated.
   Route Target Type and the Global Administrator Route Target fields
   MUST not be aggregated.

   The default route target can be used to indicate to a peer the
   willingness to receive all VPN route advertisements such as, for
   instance, the case of a route reflector speaking to one of its PE
   router clients.


4.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Pedro Marques, John Scudder, Alton Lo
   and Zhengqiang Li for discussions and review.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defined the IPV6 Constrained Route Target Capability
   for BGP.  The Capability code needs to be assigned by the IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   This extension to [RFC4684] does not change the underlying security
   issues inherent in the existing BGP and [RFC4684].

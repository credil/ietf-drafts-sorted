        This specification updates RELATED-TO and introduces new iCalendar
        properties LINK and RELATED-ID to allow better linking and

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Icalendar entities often need to be related to each other or to
        associated meta-data. These relationships can take the following
        forms
        <list style='hanging'>
          <t hangText="Structured iCalendar:">
            Icalendar entities are related to each other in some structured
            way, for example as parent, sibling, before, after.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Grouped iCalendar:">
            Icalendar entities are related to each other as a group.
            CATEGORIES are often used for this purpose but are problematic
            for application developers.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Linked:">
            Icalendar entities and non-iCalendar entities are linked
            to each other.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <section title="Structured iCalendar relationships">
        <t>
          The currently existing iCalendar <xref target='RFC5545'/>
          RELATED-TO property has no support for temporal relationships
          as used by standard project management tools.
        </t>

        <t>
          The RELTYPE parameter is extended to take new values
          defining temporal relationships, a GAP parameter is defined to provide
          lead and lag values and RELATED-TO is extended to allow URI values.
          These changes allows the RELATED-TO property to define a richer set of
          relationships useful for project management.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Grouped iCalendar relationships">
        <t>
          This specification defines a new RELATED-ID property which
          allows arbitrary groups of entities to be created. This
          provides a more structured approach to categorization, allowing
          namespaced values and providing some assurance for applications
          that these groupings will be preserved.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Linked relationships">
        <t>
          The currently existing iCalendar standard <xref target='RFC5545'/> lacks
          a general purpose method for referencing additional, external information
          relating to calendar components.
        </t>

        <t>
          This document proposes a method for referencing typed external
          information that can provide additional information about an iCalendar
          component. This new LINK property is closely aligned to the LINK header
          defined in
          <xref target='RFC5988'/>
        </t>

        <t>
          The LINK property defines a typed reference or relation to external
          meta-data or related resources. By providing type and format information
          as parameters, clients and servers are able to discover interesting
          references and make use of them, perhaps for indexing or the
          presentation of interesting links for the user.
        </t>

        <t>
          It is often necessary to relate calendar components. The current
          RELATED-TO property only allows for a UID which is inadequate for many
          purposes. Allowing other types may help but might raise a number of
          backward compatibility issues. The link property can link components
          in different collections or even on different servers.
        </t>

        <t>
          When publishing events it is useful to be able to refer back to the
          source of that information. The actual event may have been consumed from
          a feed or an ics file on a web site. A LINK property can provide
          a reference to the originator of the event.
        </t>

        <t>
          Beyond the need to relate elements temporally, project
          management tools often need to be able to specify the relationships
          between the various events and tasks which make up a project.
          The LINK property provides such a mechanism.

        STARTTOFINISH and STARTTOSTART. It also adds the DEPENDS-ON

            If this parameter is not specified on an
            allowable property, the default relationship type is PARENT.

            <t hangText="Purpose:">
              This property is used to represent a relationship or
              reference between one calendar component and another. The definition
              here extends the definition in Section 3.8.4.5. of
              <xref target='RFC5545'/> by allowing URI values adn a GAP parameter.
            </t>

            <t hangText="Value type:">
              URI or TEXT
            </t>

            <t hangText="Property Parameters:">
              Non-standard, reference type, gap, value or format type parameters can be
              specified on this property.
            </t>

            <t hangText="Conformance:">
              This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar component.
            </t>

            <t hangText="Description:">
              By default or when VALUE=UID is specified, the property value
              consists of the persistent, globally
              unique identifier of another calendar component.  This value would
              be represented in a calendar component by the "UID" property.
            </t>

            <t>
              By default, the property value points to another calendar
              component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
              object.  The "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either
              explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
              referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
              relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
              relationship or a temporal relationship.
            </t>

            <t>
              The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar
              component is a subordinate of the referenced calendar component.
              The CHILD relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
              superior of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING
              relationship indicates that the calendar component is a peer of
              the referenced calendar component.
            </t>

            <t>
              The FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART
              relationships define temporal relationships as specified in the
              reltype parameter definition.
            </t>

            <t>
              Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
              have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
              example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
              then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
              and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a
              PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is
              an implied impact to the related CHILD calendar components.  This
              property is intended only to provide information on the
              relationship of calendar components.  It is up to the target
              calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
              relationship.

            which can be used for public discussion of reference type
            proposals prior to registration. Use of the mailing list
            is strongly encouraged. The IESG will appoint a designated
            expert who will monitor the
            <eref target="mailto:icalreference@ietf.org">icalreference@ietf.org</eref>
            mailing list and review registrations.
          </t>

          <t>
            Registration of new reference types MUST be reviewed by
            the designated expert and published in an RFC. A Standard
            Tracks RFC is REQUIRED for the registration of reference types.
            A Standard Tracks RFC is also REQUIRED for changes to reference types
            previously documented in a Standard Tracks RFC.
          </t>

          <t>
            The registration procedure begins when a completed registration
            template, defined in the sections below, is sent to
            <eref target="mailto:icalreference@ietf.org">icalreference@ietf.org</eref>
            and
            <eref target="mailto:iana@iana.org">iana@iana.org</eref>.
            The designated expert is expected to tell IANA and the submitter
            of the registration within two weeks whether the registration
            is approved, approved with minor changes, or rejected with
            cause.  When a registration is rejected with cause, it can be
            re-submitted if the concerns listed in the cause are addressed.
            Decisions made by the designated expert can be appealed to the
            IESG Applications Area Director, then to the IESG. They follow
            the normal appeals procedure for IESG decisions.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

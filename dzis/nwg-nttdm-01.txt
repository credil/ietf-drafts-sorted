The TT systems of the participants collect,    represent and disseminate TT information in different formats.    As a result, management of the daily workload by a central Network   Operations Centre (NOC) is a challenge on its own. Normalization    of TTs to a common format for presentation and storing at the    central NOC is mandatory. In the present document we provide a    model for automating the collection and normalization of the TT    received by multiple networks forming the Grid. Each of the    participants is using its home TT system within its domain for    handling trouble incidents, whereas the central NOC is gathering    the tickets in the normalized format for repository and handling.    XML is used as the common representation language. The model was    defined and used as part of the networking support activity of    the EGEE project (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE).Table of Contents   1.

Introduction   Modern telecommunications networks are aimed to provide a   plethora of differentiated services to theirs customers.   Networks are becoming more sophisticated by the day, while   their offering spans a wide variety of customer types and   services. Quality of Service (QoS) [2] and Service Level    Agreement (SLA) [3] provisioning are fundamental ingredients.   Multiple interconnected institutions spread over different   countries, targeting a common approach to service offering,   along with a unified network operation scheme to support these   services, form Grid networks. Network Management is crucial for   the success of the Grid. Problem impact assessment, reporting,   identification and handling as well as trouble information   dissemination and delegation of authority are some of the main   tasks that have to be implemented by the members of the Grid.   The current work evolved within the specific Service Activity 2   (SA2 - network support) of the European funded EGEE [1] project.   A central NOC, called the ENOC (EGEE Network Operating Centre) [4]   is responsible for collecting and handling multiple network TTs   received by the participating network providers' TT systems.   Different TT systems are used by each of them, delivering TTs   in alternate formats, while TT load is growing proportionally   with the network size and the serviced users. TT normalization,   i.e. transformation to a common format that is "reasonable" for   all parties and copes with service demands in a dynamic and   effective way, is of crucial importance for successful   management of the Grid.   In the present work we define a data model for TT normalization   initially targeted for networking providers serving EGEE. The   model is designed in accordance with RFC 1297 [11] and the    specific needs of the participants, meeting requirements of the    multiple TT systems used. It is both effective and comprehensive,    as it compensates for the core activities of the NOCs. It is also    dynamic as it allows other options to be included in the future,    according to demand. It provides an XML representation for conveying   incident information across administrative domains between   parties that have an operational responsibility of remediation   or a watch-and-warning over a defined constituency.  The data   model encodes information about hosts, networks, and the   services running on these systems; attack methodology and   associated forensic evidence; impact of the activity; and   limited approaches for documenting workflow.Zisiadis, et al.

Community adoption of the    NTTDM enhances trouble resolution within the grid framework    and imparts network status cognisance by modelling collaboration    and information exchange among the operators. The NTTDM definition    provides:   o  A common format that allows GOC as well as all participating      NOCs to store, exchange, manage and analyze TTs (assessment      of TT impact).   o  Increased automation in handling a TT since the network      operators have a common view to the trouble.   The model was designed and used as part of the networking   support activity of the EGEE project.1.1. Terminology   NTTDM uses specific keywords to describe the various data   components. These keywords are:    Defined, Free, Multiple, List, Predefined String, String,    Datetime, Solved, Cancelled, Inactive, Superseded,    Opened/Closed, Operational, Informational, Administrative,    Test.    Those in this document are to be interpreted as described    in Section 2.1.2. Notations   The NTTDM is specified in two ways, as an abstract data model   and as an XML Schema. Section 3 provides a Unified Modeling   Language (UML) [5] model describing the individual classes and   their relationship with each other.   The semantics of each   class are discussed and their attributes explained. In Section   6, this UML model is converted in an XML Schema [6, 7, 8, 9].   A specific namespace [10] is also defined.   The term "XML document" refers to any instance of an XML   document.   The term "NTTDM document" refers to specific   elements and attributes of the NTTDM schema.   Finally, the   terms "class", and "element" will be used interchangeably to   reference either a given UML class in the data model or its   corresponding schema implementation.Zisiadis, et al.

About the Network Trouble Ticket Data Model   The NTTDM is a data representation that provides a framework   for normalizing and sharing information among network operators   and the GOC regarding troubles within the Grid boundaries.   There has been a lot of thought processing during the design of   the data model:   o  The data model serves as a common storage and exchange      format.   o  Every NOC still uses its home TT system for network      management within its area of control.   o  As there is no universally adopted definition for a trouble,      in the NTTDM definition the term is used with a comprehensive      meaning to cover all NOCs.   o  Handling every possible definition of a trouble incident      would call for an extremely expanded and complex data model.      Therefore, the NTTDM purpose is to serve as the basis to      normalize and exchange TTs. It is flexible and expressive in      order to ensure that specific NOC requirements are met.      Specific NOC information is kept outside the NTTDM and      external databases can be used to feed it.   o  The domain of managing the information is not fully      standardized and must rely on free-form textual descriptions.      The NTTDM attempts to strike a balance between supporting      this free-form content, while still allowing automated      processing of incident information.   The NTTDM is only one of feasible TT data representations. The   goal of this design was to be as effective and comprehensive to   cover for the management of a general grid environment.   The   already used TT formats influenced the design of the NTTDM.1.4. About the Network Trouble Ticket Implementation   Here we describe an example of typical use case.   The Grid project EGEE manages its infrastructure as network   overlay over the European NRENs and want to be able to warn   EGEE sites of the unavailability of the network. Thanks to   collaboration with its network provider the EGEE NOC receive   TTs (800 tickets/month, 2500 emails/month) from 20 NRENs and   should be able to cope with the heavy TT process. Thanks to    the NTTDM the EGEE NOC can automate the TT workflow:Zisiadis, et al.

NTTDM Types and Definitions   The various data elements of the TT data model are typed.  This   section discusses these data types.  When possible, native   Schema data types were adopted, but for more complicated   formats, regular expressions or external standards were used.2.1 Types and Definitions for the TYPE attributes   These types are used to describe the TYPE attributes.2.1.1 Defined   The Defined data type means that the data model provides a mean   to compute this value from the rest of the fields.   The Defined data type is implemented as a "Defined" in the   schema.2.1.2 Free   The Free data type means that the value can be freely chosen.   All Free string should have as an attribute the language used.   The Free data type is implemented as a "Free" in the schema.2.1.3 Multiple   The Multiple data type consists of one value among multiple   fixed values.    The Multiple data type is implemented as an "Multiple" in the   schema.2.1.4 List   List means many values among multiple fixed values.   The List data type is implemented as a "List" in the schema.Zisiadis, et al.

NTTDM   In this section, the individual components of NTTDM will be   discussed  in   detail.  This  class  provides  a  standardized   representation for commonly exchanged Field Name data.3.1 NTTDM Components3.1.1 NTTDM Attributes   The Field Name class has four attributes. Each attribute   provides information about a Field Name instance. The   attributes that characterize one instance constitute all the   information required to form the data model.   DESCRIPTION     This field contains a short description of the field name.   TYPE     The TYPE attribute contains information about the type of     the field name it depends on. The values that it may contain     are: Defined, Free, Multiple, List.   VALID FORMAT     This attribute contains information about the format of each     field. The values that it may contain are: PREDEFINED     STRING, STRING, DATETIME.Zisiadis, et al.

Internationalization Issues   Internationalization and localization is of specific concern to   the NTTDM, since it is only through collaboration, often across   language barriers, that certain incidents be resolved. The   NTTDM supports this goal by depending on XML constructs, and   through explicit design choices in the data model.   The main advantage of the model is that it provides a   normalized data type that is implemented fully in the English   language and can be used conveniently. It also supports Free   formed text that can be written in any language. In the future   it will provide translation services for all the free-formed   text.5.

Security Considerations   Some security issues should be kept in mind as network TTs   could carry sensitive information (IP addresses, contact   details, authentication details, commercial providers involved   etc.) about flagship institutions (military, health centre...).   o  Integrity: The HASH field is intended to ensure integrity of      received tickets.   o  Confidentiality: could be ensured by encrypting whole tickets      or only some parts. This could allow having meaningful      tickets to be disclosed while only sensitive information      protected.   o  Peer entity authentication: message sender authentication must      be provided in order to establish session with data origin       authentication regardless of the form in which the TTs are      exchanged, being either delivered through email, web forms or      through a SOAP service. The latter is considered the better choice,      the model itself though does not specify the communications      requirements.8. IANA Considerations   Nothing is yet appplied.    The following registrations will have to be accomodated at a    latter stage:   o  NTTDM namespace: "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:NTTDM-1.0"      o  NTTDM XML Schema: "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:NTTDM-1.0"    9.

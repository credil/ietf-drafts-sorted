Abstract


   Handling multiple sets of network trouble tickets (TTs) 
   originating from different participants inter-connected network
   environments poses a series of challenges for the involved 
   institutions, Grid is a good example of such multi-domain project.
   Each of the participants follows different procedures for handling 
   trouble in its domain, according to the local technical and 
   linguistic profile. The TT systems of the participants collect, 
   represent and disseminate TT information in different formats. 
   As a result, management of the daily workload by a central Network
   Operations Centre (NOC) is a challenge on its own. Normalization 
   of TTs to a common format at the central NOC can ease presentation,
   storing and handling of the TTs. In the present document we provide a 
   model for automating the collection and normalization of the TT 
   received by multiple networks forming the Grid. Each of the 
   participants is using its home TT system within its domain for 
   handling trouble incidents, whereas the central NOC is gathering 
   the tickets in the normalized format for repository and handling. 
   XML is used as the common representation language. The model was 
   defined and used as part of the networking support activity of 
   the EGEE project (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE).

1.  Introduction

   Problem impact assessment, reporting identification and handling
   as well as trouble information dissemination and delegation of
   authority are some of the main tasks that have to be implemented
   by the members of a Grid, for succession in managing the network
   and maintaining operational efficiency of the services offered to its
   users.
   Different TT systems are used by each network domain, delivering TTs
   in alternate formats, while TT load is growing proportionally with
   the network size and the serviced users. 
   Hereby we define a data model for TT normalization initially
   targeted for networking providers serving EGEE [7]. The model is 
   designed in accordance with RFC 1297 [10], meeting requirements
   of the multiple TT systems used. 
   It is both effective and comprehensive, as it compensates for 
   the core activities of the NOCs. It is also dynamic, allowing 
   additional options to be included in the future, according to demand.
   It provides an XML representation for conveying incident information
   across administrative domains between parties that have an
   operational responsibility of remediation or a watch-and-warning over
   a defined constituency.  
   The data model encodes information about hosts, networks, and the
   services running on these systems; attack methodology and associated
   forensic evidence; impact of the activity; and limited approaches for
   documenting workflow.
   The Network Trouble Ticket Data Model (NTTDM) aims to simplify
   TT exchange within the boundaries of a Grid and to enhance the
   functional cooperation of every Network operation Centre (NOC)
   and the Grid Operation Centre (GOC). Community adoption of the 
   NTTDM enhances trouble resolution within the grid framework 
   and imparts network status cognizance by modeling collaboration 
   and information exchange among the operators. The NTTDM definition 
   provides:

   o  A common format that allows GOC as well as all participating
      NOCs to store, exchange, manage and analyze TTs (assessment
      of TT impact).

   o  Increased automation in handling a TT since the network
      operators have a common view to the trouble.

   The model was designed and used as part of the networking
   support activity of the EGEE project, as part of the ENOC (EGEE
   Network Operating Centre) [8] procedures for managing the Grid.

1.1. Terminology

   NTTDM uses specific keywords to describe the various data
   components. These keywords are: 
   Defined, Free, Multiple, List, Predefined String, String, 
   Datetime, Solved, Cancelled, Inactive, Superseded, 
   Opened/Closed, Operational, Informational, Administrative, 
   Test. 

   Those in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   Section 2.


1.2. Notations

   The NTTDM is specified in two ways, as an abstract data model
   and as an XML Schema. Section 3 provides a Unified Modeling
   Language (UML) [9] model describing the individual classes and
   their relationship with each other.   The semantics of each
   class are discussed and their attributes explained. In Section
   6, this UML model is converted in an XML Schema [1, 2, 3, 4].
   A specific namespace [5] is also defined.

   The term "XML document" refers to any instance of an XML
   Document. The term "NTTDM document" refers to specific
   elements and attributes of the NTTDM schema.   Finally, the
   terms "class", and "element" will be used interchangeably to
   reference either a given UML class in the data model or its
   corresponding schema implementation.


1.3. About the Network Trouble Ticket Data Model

   The NTTDM is a data representation that provides a framework
   for normalizing and sharing information among network operators
   and the GOC regarding troubles within the Grid boundaries.
   There has been a lot of thought processing during the design of
   the data model:

   o  The data model serves as a common storage and exchange format.

   o  Every NOC still uses its home TT system for network management
      within its area of control.

   o  As there is no universally adopted definition for a trouble,
      in the NTTDM definition the term is used with a comprehensive
      meaning to cover all NOCs.

Zisiadis, et al.              Expires March 20, 2011            [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                      NTTDM                   October 2010


   o  Handling every possible definition of a trouble incident
      would call for an extremely expanded and complex data model.
      Therefore, the NTTDM purpose is to serve as the basis to
      normalize and exchange TTs. It is flexible and expressive in
      order to ensure that specific NOC requirements are met.
      Specific NOC information is kept outside the NTTDM and
      external databases can be used to feed it.

   o  The domain of managing the information is not fully
       standardized and must rely on free-form textual descriptions.
      The NTTDM attempts to strike a balance between supporting
       this free-form content, while still allowing automated
       processing of incident information.

   The NTTDM is only one of feasible TT data representations. The
   goal of this design was to be as effective and comprehensive to
   cover for the management of a general grid environment.   The
   already used TT formats influenced the design of the NTTDM.


1.4. About the Network Trouble Ticket Implementation

   Here we describe an example of typical use case.
   The Grid project EGEE manages its infrastructure as network
   overlay over the European NRENs and want to be able to warn
   EGEE sites of the unavailability of the network. Thanks to
   collaboration with its network provider the EGEE NOC receive
   TTs (800 tickets/month, 2500 emails/month) from 20 NRENs and
   should be able to cope with the heavy TT process. Thanks to 
   the NTTDM the EGEE NOC can automate the TT workflow:

   o  TT is filtered, sorted and stored in local DB.

   o  TT impact on the Grid is assessed.

   o  TT is pushed to dashboard and other tools (EGEE TT system,
      statistics, etc.)


1.5. Future plans

   Since this is an Experimental document, operational experience will
   be used to expand the sections under 'Ticket Origin Information?.
   The current specification is already used within EGEE. Other Grids
   are free to use it and report comments to the authors. After enough 
   experimentation it will be placed on the Standards Track.

2.  NTTDM Types and Definitions

   The various data elements of the TT data model are typed.  This
   section discusses these data types.  When possible, native Schema
   data types were adopted, but for more complicated formats, regular
   expressions or external standards were used.


2.1 Types and Definitions for the TYPE attribute.

   These types are used to describe the TYPE attribute.


2.1.1 Defined

   The Defined data type means that the data model provides a mean
   to compute this value from the rest of the fields.

   The Defined data type is implemented as a "Defined" in the
   schema.


2.1.2 Free

   The Free data type means that the value can be freely chosen.

   All Free string should have as an attribute the language used.

   The Free data type is implemented as a "Free" in the schema.


2.1.3 Multiple

   The Multiple data type consists of one value among multiple
   fixed values.
 
   The Multiple data type is implemented as an "Multiple" in the
   schema.


2.1.4 List

   List means many values among multiple fixed values.
   The List data type is implemented as a "List" in the schema.

2.2 Types and Definitions for the VALID FORMAT attributes


2.2.1 Predefined String

   A Predefined String means the different values are predefined
   in the data model.

   Each field that requires a Predefined String contains a specific 
   value. Here is the table that shows the allowed values for such 
   fields.

   TT_STATUS

     o  Opened: the ticket is opened.

     o  Closed: the ticket is closed.

     o  Updated: the ticket's contents have been updated.
   
     o  Cancelled: the ticket has been opened twice, one of the both
        tickets is cancelled and a relation is done between them via
        RELATED_ACTIVITY.

     o  Solved: the incident is solved but the team prefers to
        monitor for check.

     o  Opened/closed stands for tickets that are opened only to
        report an incident that is already solved.

     o  Inactive: the ticket is under the responsibility of an
        external domain and is no more under the domain control.

     o  Reopened: the ticket was closed by error, or the problem
        was faulty declared solved. Historical data are very important 
        at this case. 

     o  Superseded: the ticket has been superseded by another one
        (case of a bigger problem having raised many tickets and
        being merged in one single incident). The RELATED_ACTIVITY
        field should include the master ticket reference.

   Allowed transitions for TT_STATUS are only those following.
   Possible final states are indicated with (X).

2.2.3 Datetime

   Date-time strings are represented by the Datetime data type.
   Each date-time string identifies a particular instant in time;
   ranges are not supported.
   Date-time strings are formatted according to a subset of ISO
   8601: 2000 documented in RFC 3339.

   The Datetime data type is implemented as an "xs:dateTime" in
   the schema.


3. NTTDM

   In this section, the individual components of NTTDM will be
   discussed  in detail. This class provides a standardized
   representation for commonly exchanged Field Name data.


3.1 NTTDM Components


3.1.1 NTTDM Attributes

   The Field Name class has four attributes. Each attribute
   provides information about a Field Name instance. The
   attributes that characterize one instance constitute all the
   information required to form the data model.

   DESCRIPTION

     This field contains a short description of the field name.

   TYPE

     The TYPE attribute contains information about the type of the field
     name it depends on. The values that it may contain are: 
     Defined, Free, Multiple, List.

   VALID FORMAT

     This attribute contains information about the format of each field.
     The values that it may contain are: Predefined String, String,
     Datetime.

   MANDATORY

     This attribute indicates if the information of each field is
     required or is optional. In case the information is required
     the field MANDATORY contains the word: "YES". On the
     contrary, when filling the information is optional, the
     field MANDATORY contains the word "NO".


3.2 NTTDM Aggregate Classes


3.2.1 NTTDM-Document class

   The NTTDM-Document class is the top-level class in NTTDM. All
   NTTDM documents are an instance of this class.

   +---------------+
   | NTTDM-Document|
   +---------------+
   | version       |<>--{1..*}--[ Ticket     ]
   | lang          |
   +---------------+

                     Figure 3: NTTDM-Document class

   The aggregate class that constitutes NTTDM-Document is:

   Ticket
     One or more. The information related to a single ticket.

   The NTTDM-Document class has two attributes:

   version
     STRING. The value of this attribute MUST be "1.00"

     lang
       Required.


3.2.2 Ticket class

   Every ticket is represented by an instance of the Ticket class.
   This class provides a standardized representation for commonly
   exchanged TT data.

4. Internationalization Issues

   Internationalization and localization is of specific concern to
   the NTTDM, since it is only through collaboration, often across
   language barriers, that certain incidents be resolved. The
   NTTDM supports this goal by depending on XML constructs, and
   through explicit design choices in the data model.
   The main advantage of the model is that it provides a
   normalized data type that is implemented fully in the English
   language and can be used conveniently. It also supports Free
   formed text that can be written in any language. In the future
   it will provide translation services for all the free-formed
   text.


5. Example


5.1 Link Failure

   In this section an example is provided of network TTs exchanged
   using the proposed format. This is an actual GRNet ticket
   normalized according to TTDM. Fields that were not included in
   the ticket are left blank.

7. Security Considerations

   The NTTDM data model defines a data model and the relevant XML
   schema for trouble ticket normalization; as such, NTTDM itself 
   does not raise any security concerns. However, some security 
   issues SHOULD be considered as network TTs could carry sensitive
   information (IP addresses, contact details, authentication details,
   commercial providers involved etc.) about flagship institutions 
   (military, health centre...).    

   The security considerations MAY involve measures during the exchange
   as well as during processing of the information.
   The HASH field is intended to provide an integrity ensurance 
   attribute within the exchanged tickets, however it does not ensure
   integrity alone. 
   Confidentiality MAY be ensured by encrypting whole tickets or only 
   some parts. This could allow having meaningful tickets to be
   disclosed while only sensitive information protected.
   Peer entity authentication SHOULD be provided in order to establish 
   session with data origin authentication regardless of the form in 
   which the TTs are exchanged, being either delivered through email,

   web forms or through a SOAP service. The latter is considered the
   better choice, the model itself though does not specify the 
   communications requirements.
   The underlying communications service MUST provide guarantees to 
   properly address integrity, confidentiality and peer entity 
   authentication. The selection of the enforcing mechanisms is not in 
   the scope of this document and the choice is up to the implementers. 

   For data processing security each participating organization MAY
   use its own privacy policy, as part of its own data processing 
   system. This approach avoids any interoperability issues and does not
   pose any extra burden for the adoption of the current scheme into the 
   operational procedures of the NOCs. Unauthorized and inappropriate
   usage MUST be avoided.


8. IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe an XML namespace and schema
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [6].

   Registration for the NTTDM namespace:

     o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:nttdm-1.0
     o  Registrant Contact: See the first author of the "Author's
        Address" section of this document.
     o  XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML 
        specification.

  Registration for the NTTDM XML schema:

     o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:nttdm-1.0
     o  Registrant Contact: See the first author of the "Author's 
        Address" section of this document.
     o  XML: See the XML Schema in Section 6 of this document.

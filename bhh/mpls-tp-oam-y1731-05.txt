Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP OAM based on Y.1731             July 2010 
    

1. Introduction 

   This document describes the method for leveraging Y.1731 [2] Protocol 
   Data Units (PDUs) and procedures to provide a set of Operation, 
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms that meet the MPLS 
   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) OAM requirements as defined in [6]. 

   ITU-T Recommendation Y.1731 [2] specifies: 

   o OAM PDUs and procedures that meet the transport networks 
     requirements for OAM 

   o Encapsulation mechanisms to carry these OAM PDUs within Ethernet 
     frames to provide Ethernet OAM capabilities in Ethernet networks 

   Although Y.1731 is focused on Ethernet OAM, the definition of OAM 
   PDUs and procedures are technology independent and can also be used 
   in other packet technologies (e.g., MPLS-TP) provided that the 
   technology specific encapsulation is defined. 

   The OAM toolset defined in Y.1731 [2] serves as a benchmark for a 
   high performance, comprehensive suite of packet transport OAM 
   capabilities.  It can be provided by lightweight protocol design and 
   supports operational simplicity by providing commonality with the 
   established operation models utilized in other transport network 
   technologies (e.g., SDH/SONET and OTN). 

   This document describes mechanisms for MPLS-TP OAM that reuse the 
   same OAM PDUs and procedures defined in Y.1731 [2], together with the 
   necessary MPLS-TP technology specific encapsulation mechanisms. 

   The advantages offered by this toolset are summarized below: 

   o Simplify the operations for the network operators and service 
     providers that have to test and maintain a single general OAM 
     protocol set when operating LSP, PW and VPLS networks. 

   o Accelerate the market adoption of MPLS-TP since Y.1731 is already 
     mature, supported, and deployed. 

   o Reduce the complexity and increase the reuse of code for 
     implementation in packet transport devices that may support both 
     Ethernet and MPLS-TP capabilities, e.g. VPLS and H-VPLS 
     applications.

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP OAM based on Y.1731             July 2010 
    

   Ethernet OAM is also defined by IEEE 802.1ag [9]. IEEE 802.1ag and 
   ITU-T Y.1731 have been developed in cooperation by IEEE and ITU. They 
   support a common subset of OAM functions. IEEE 802.1ag defines 
   additional status reporting that is advantageous in enterprise 
   networks but not required in transport networks. ITU-T Y.1731 defines 
   additional OAM mechanisms that are important for the transport 
   network (e.g. AIS, DM, LM). 

   This document does not deprecate existing MPLS and PW OAM mechanisms 
   nor preclude definition of other MPLS-TP OAM tools. 

   The mechanisms described in this document, when used to provide MPLS-
   TP PW OAM functions, are open to support the OAM message mapping 
   procedures defined in [7]. In order to support those procedures, the 
   PEs MUST map the states of the procedures defined in Y.1731 to the PW 
   defect states defined in [7]. 

   The mapping procedures are outside the scope of this version of the 
   document. They will be specified in a future version of this 
   document, in a future version of [7] or in another document that 
   updates [7]. 

   In the rest of this document the term "OAM PDU" is used to indicate 
   an OAM PDU whose format and associated procedures are defined in 
   Y.1731 [2] and that this document proposes to be used to provide 
   MPLS-TP OAM functions.

3. Encapsulation of OAM PDU in MPLS-TP 

   Although Y.1731 is focused on Ethernet OAM, the definition of OAM 
   PDUs and procedures are technology independent. 

   When used to provide Ethernet OAM capabilities, these PDUs are 
   encapsulated into an Ethernet frame where an Ethernet header is 
   prepended to the OAM PDUs. 

   The MAC DA is used to identify the MEPs and MIPs where the OAM PDU 
   needs to be processed. The EtherType is used to distinguish OAM 
   frames from user data frames. 

   Within MPLS-TP OAM Framework [4], OAM packets are distinguished from 
   user data packets using the GAL and ACH [3] construct and they are 
   addressed to MEPs or MIPs using existing MPLS forwarding mechanisms 
   (i.e. label stacking and TTL expiration). It is therefore possible to 
   reuse the OAM PDUs defined in [2] within MPLS-TP and encapsulate them 
   within ACH. 

   A single ACH Channel Type (0xXX) is required to identify the presence 
   of Y.1731 OAM PDU. Within the OAM PDU, the OpCode field, defined in 
   [2], allows identifying the specific OAM PDU. 

   OAM PDUs are encapsulated using the ACH, according to [3], as 
   described in Figure 1 below.

   Moreover, MPLS-TP relies upon a different mechanism for supporting 
   tandem connection monitoring (i.e. label stacking) than the fixed MEL 
   (Maintenance Entity Group Level) field used in Ethernet. 

   Therefore in MPLS-TP the MEL field is not used for supporting tandem 
   connection monitoring. 

   When OAM PDUs are used in MPLS-TP, the MEL field MUST be set on 
   transmission and checked at reception for compliancy with Y.1731 [2]. 

   The MEL value to set and check MUST be configurable. The DEFAULT 
   value MUST be "111". With co-routed bidirectional transport paths, 
   the configured MEL MUST be the same in both directions. 

   The OpCode field identifies the type of the OAM PDU. 

   The setting of the Version, Flags and TLV Offset is OpCode specific 
   and described in Y.1731 [2]. 

4. MPLS-TP OAM Functions 

   This section describes the OAM functions that can be supported 
   reusing the OAM PDUs and procedures defined in Y.1731 [2] to meet 
   MPLS-TP OAM Requirements, as defined in [6].

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP OAM based on Y.1731             July 2010 
    

   This document is proposing not to use the Y.1731 MCC OAM PDU in 
   MPLS-TP. The solution proposed in [5], where MCC PDU is directly 
   encapsulated within an ACH with a PID, SHOULD be used instead. 

   The LTM/LTR OAM PDUs, as currently defined Y.1731 [2], are tracing 
   the path for a specific MAC address. Their purpose is to test the MAC 
   Address Forwarding tables. Due to the fact that MPLS-TP forwarding is 
   not based on the MAC Address Forwarding tables, these tools are not 
   applicable to MPLS-TP as currently defined. 

   In order to support the MPLS-TP OAM Requirements for Route Tracing, 
   as defined in [6], two options are possible: 

   o extend the current definition of LTM/LTR to make them applicable 
      to MPLS-TP; 

   o define a new tool (as reported in section 1, this document is not 
      precluding the definition of other MPLS-TP OAM tools). 

4.1. Pro-active CC-V and RDI (CCM) 

   The CCM PDU, defined in Y.1731 [2] and encapsulated within MPLS-TP as 
   described in section 3, can be used to support the following MPLS-TP 
   OAM functional requirements: 

   o Pro-active continuity check (section 2.2.2 of [6]); 

   o Pro-active connectivity verification (section 2.2.3 of [6]); 

   o Pro-active remote defect indication (section 2.2.9 of [6]); 

   o Pro-active packet loss measurement (section 2.2.11 of [6]). 

   Procedures for generating and processing CCM PDUs are defined in 
   Y.1731 [2]. 

   It is worth noting that the use of CCM does not require any 
   additional status information other than the configuration parameters 
   and defect states. 

   The transmission period of the CCM MUST always be the configured 
   period and MUST not change unless the operator reconfigures it. This 
   is a fundamental requirement to allow deterministic and predictable 
   protocol behavior: in transport networks the operator configures and 
   fully controls the repetition rate of pro-active CC-V.

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP OAM based on Y.1731             July 2010 
    

   In order to perform pro-active Connectivity Verification, the CCM 
   packet contains a globally unique identifier of the source MEP, as 
   described in [4]. 

   The source MEP for LSPs, PWs and Sections is identified by combining 
   a globally unique MEG ID (see section 4.1.1) with a MEP ID that is 
   unique within the scope of the Maintenance Entity Group. 

4.1.1. MEG ID Formats 

   The generic format for MEG ID is defined in Figure A-1 of Y.1731 [2]. 
   Different formats of MEG ID are allowed: the MEG ID format type is 
   identified by the MEG ID Format field. 

   The format of the ICC-based MEG ID is defined in Annex A of Y.1731 
   [2]. This format is applicable to MPLS-TP Sections, LSPs and PWs. 

   MPLS-TP supports also IP-based format for MEG ID. These formats are 
   defined in this section. 

   The IP-based formats for MEG ID will be added in a future version of 
   the document. 

4.2. OAM Loopback (LB) 

   The LBM/LBR PDUs, defined in Y.1731 [2] and encapsulated within MPLS-
   TP as described in section 3, and can be used to support the 
   following MPLS-TP OAM functional requirements: 

   o On-demand bidirectional connectivity verification  (section 2.2.3 
     of [6]); 

   o Bidirectional in-service or out-of-service diagnostic test  
     (section 2.2.5 of [6]). 

   Procedures for generating and processing LBM/LBR PDUs are defined in 
   Y.1731 [2]. 

   It is worth noticing that these OAM PDUs cover different functions 
   than those defined in [8]. 

   When the LBM/LBR is used for out-of-service diagnostic test, it is 
   REQUIRED that the transport path is locked on both MEPs before the 
   diagnostic test is performed. In transport networks, the transport

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP OAM based on Y.1731             July 2010 
    

   path is locked on both sides by network management operations. 
   However, single-ended procedures as defined in [8] MAY be used. 

   LBM/LBR OAM requires Target MEP/MIP ID and Originator MEP ID to be 
   carried. Current Y.1731 Recommendation [2] assumes that those IDs are 
   carried in the DA and SA fields of the encapsulating Ethernet frames. 
   In MPLS-TP OAM those IDs can be carried in additional TLV within the 
   LBM/LBR PDU shown in Figure 2. 

   A LBM packet with the Target MIP/MEP ID equal to the ID of receiving 
   MIP or MEP is considered to be a valid LBM packet. Every field in the 
   LBM packet is copied to the LBR packet, only the OpCode field is 
   changed from LBM to LBR. 

   When a MEP receives an LBR packet with the Originator MEP ID equal to 
   its ID, with an expected Transaction ID and within 5 seconds after 
   transmitting the LBM packet, the LBR packet is valid. Otherwise the 
   LBR packet addressed to it is invalid and is discarded.

   The Target MEP/MIP ID, if present, MUST be the first TLV within the 
   OAM PDU. The Originator MEP ID TLV, if present, MUST immediately 
   follow the Target MEP/MIP ID TLV. 

   When the LBM packet is sent to a target MIP, the source MEP MUST know 
   the hop count to the target MIP and set the TTL field accordingly. 

4.2.1. Format of MEP and MIP ID TLV 

   To be added in a future version of the document. 

4.3. Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) 

   The AIS PDU, defined in Y.1731 [2] and encapsulated within MPLS-TP as 
   described in section 3, can be used to support the alarm reporting 
   MPLS-TP OAM functional requirement (section 2.2.8 of [6]). 

   Procedures for generating and processing AIS PDUs are defined in 
   Y.1731 [2]. 

4.4. Lock Reporting (LCK) 

   The LCK PDU, defined in Y.1731 [2] and encapsulated within MPLS-TP as 
   described in section 3, can be used to support the lock reporting 
   MPLS-TP OAM functional requirement (section 2.2.7 of [6]). 

   Procedures for generating and processing LCK PDUs are defined in 
   Y.1731 [2]. 

4.5. Test (TST) 

   The TST PDU, defined in Y.1731 [2] and encapsulated within MPLS-TP as 
   described in section 3, can be used to support the uni-directional 
   in-service or out-of-service diagnostic tests MPLS-TP OAM functional 
   requirement (section 2.2.8 of [6]). 

   Procedures for generating and processing TST PDUs are defined in 
   Y.1731 [2]. 

4.6. Automatic Protection Switching (APS) 

   The APS PDU supports the requirements for MPLS-TP protection 
   switching coordination.

   The complete format of the APS PDUs and the associated procedures are 
   outside the scope of [2]. They will be added in future version of 
   this document. 

4.7. Loss Measurement (LM) 

   The LMM/LMR PDUs, defined in Y.1731 [2] and encapsulated within MPLS-
   TP as described in section 3, can be used to support on-demand and 
   proactive packet loss measurement MPLS-TP OAM functional requirement 
   (section 2.2.11 of [6]). 

   Procedures for generating and processing LMM/LMR PDUs are defined in 
   Y.1731 [2]. 

4.8. One-way delay measurement (1DM) 

   The 1DM PDU, defined in Y.1731 [2] and encapsulated within MPLS-TP as 
   described in section 3, can be used to support the on-demand one-way 
   packet delay measurement MPLS-TP OAM functional requirement (section 
   2.2.12 of [6]). 

   It can also be used to support proactive one-way delay measurement 
   MPLS-TP OAM functional requirement (section 2.2.12 of [6]). 

   Procedures for generating and processing 1DM PDUs are defined in 
   Y.1731 [2]. 

4.9. Two-way delay Measurement Message/Reply (DM) 

   The DMM/DMR PDUs, defined in Y.1731 [2] and encapsulated within MPLS-
   TP as described in section 3, can be used to support on-demand two-
   ways packet delay measurement MPLS-TP OAM functional requirement 
   (section 2.2.12 of [6]). 

   It can also be used to support proactive two-ways packet delay 
   measurement MPLS-TP OAM functional requirement (section 2.2.12 of 
   [6]). 

   Procedures for generating and processing DMM/DMR PDUs are defined in 
   Y.1731 [2].

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to allocate a Channel Type value 0xXX to identify 
   an associated channel carrying all the OAM PDUs that are defined in 
   section 4 

   [Editor's note - The value 0x8902 has been proposed to keep the 
   channel type identical to the EtherType value used in Ethernet OAM]

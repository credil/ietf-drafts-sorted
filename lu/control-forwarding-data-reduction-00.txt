Abstract

   Data exchange between the control plane and the forwarding plane
   becomes the bottleneck of modern routers in terms of scalability and
   convergence.  This paper describes a method which reduces the volume
   of information transferred from the control plane to the forwarding
   plane.  The reduction has no impact on routing table precision, but
   it brings up the convergence speed significantly.

Internet-Draft      Control Forwarding Data Reduction       October 2010


1.  Introduction

   One link breakage, or merely a metric change, can cause vast amount
   of routing table updates and RIB, FIB downloading.

   Nobody likes that.  But everybody lives with that.  Due to the de
   facto format of the routing table, defined in TCP/IP Illustrated
   [Wright94] for example, every route entry has to be resolved to map
   to a local outgoing interface, commonly called nexthop.

   The advantage of this format is that when it comes to forwarding,
   traffic can readily be dispatched through the nexthop interfaces.


                                 x
                                A---B---C---
                                y\ /
                                  D

                         Figure 1: Sample Topology

   The trade off however is that a single route change can affect many
   destinations that are linked through the same route.  For example, as
   shown in Figure 1, router A can reach thousands of routes (rt1, rt2,
   ..., rtn) behind router C through its outgoing interface x.  The
   routing table looks like the one shown in Table 1.

                                | B   | x |
                                | D   | y |
                                | C   | x |
                                | rt1 | x |
                                | rt2 | x |
                                | ..  |   |
                                | rtn | x |

                       Table 1: Sample Routing Table

   When the link off x breaks, router A will have to use interface y to
   reach B, and subsequently C, rt1, rt2, etc.  The new routing table
   would look like Table 2.

                Table 2: Sample Routing Table After Change

   Compared to Table 1, many entries are changed.  They all have to be
   downloaded to RIB, which in turn downloads them to FIB.  This is very
   costly.

   This memo proposes a method that keeps the routing table change
   constrained around the area of failure, hence greatly reduce the
   impact of the topology change.

2.  Existing Method

   Upon topology change, the existing method marks changes on all
   affected routes that switch to use different outgoing interfaces.
   The number of these routes can be very high such as hundreds of

   thousands.  All these routes will have to be downloaded to RIB which
   in turn downloads them to the forwarding data plane.

2.1.  Disadvantages

   The existing method incurs burden on routing table management.  It
   also demands lots of downloading effort to RIB and FIB.  These
   efforts are proportional to the size of the network.

   When the network size becomes large, all four processes, i.e. routing
   table updates, RIB downloading, FIB downloading, and FIB updates,
   become bottlenecks, resulting in very slow overall system convergence
   time, if it converges at all.


3.  Proposed Method

   This method solves the following three problems.

   a.  Routing Table localization;

   b.  RIB/FIB fast downloading;

   c.  FIB fast lookup.

   None of these three problems is trivial to deal with.  The solution
   will not be practical until all these issues are addressed.

   The routing table localization is not very much pursued because
   people tend to link this to the incremental SPF (iSPF).  There is
   never ceasing argument about the iSPF on whether it is necessary or
   worthy of the overhead.  Numerous algorithms were proposed to improve
   or to justify the iSPF, but none of them is ideal.  However this is
   not the focus of the routing table localization.  Regardless of the
   method used, the final routing table has to be the same.  The
   proposed method separates the routing table optimization, or more
   precisely routing table localization, from the SPF method which can
   be improved independently and is beyond the scope of this memo.

   The RIB/FIB downloading is the key bottleneck in modern routers.
   This is also the triggering point that leads to this proposal.

   The savings on the application (routing process) and the downloading
   could take a toll on the forwarding process, especially the FIB
   lookup.  Reducing or removing such impact is also an important
   consideration of this proposal.

3.1.  Advantages

   The main advantage is scalability.

   With the traditional method, the impact of a single network change is
   often domain wide and is variable depending on the location of the
   failure.  The proposed method limits the impact to a local scope
   which is centered on the point of failure and is usually one or two
   hops in size.  In most cases, the number of affected routes is near
   or below the average number of routers' interfaces.  And this number
   will not go up proportionally with the network size like in the case
   of traditional handling.

   The scalability issue will transfer to the convergence time and
   traffic outage time.

   For a large size network, the difference can be very significant.
   Table 3 and Table 4 lists some comparison data for a set of typical
   n-cube topology.  The n-cube is a half meshed network with most
   available links which are orthogonal to each other.  It is often used
   to simulate real production networks.

   The number n in n-cube denotes the dimension.  So the total number of
   nodes (or routers) is 2 to the power of n which is 2**n.  And the
   total number of edges is n*2**(n-1).

   We create three network scenarios from small to large size.  We
   assume each node has 100 additional routes attached.  These routes
   can be of any kind such as the ones redistributed from BGP.  The cost
   on the edge is the same for all edges and for both directions.  The
   total number of routes is the sum of links and leaf routes.

   Table 3 and Table 4 show the side by side performance comparison
   between the convention method and the proposed method.  The two
   tables share the same topology matrix.  The three columns to the
   right show the possible impact of a single link change.  These three
   columns' names indicate the locality of the point of failure.  Near
   means it is near the computing router.  Far means far away in terms
   of hop counts and distance.  Mid means in between.

                 Table 4: Change Impacts: Proposed Method

   In these exemplary networks, the proposed method works very well with
   different network size.  If implemented, the router will respond to
   network changes swiftly.

   The reduction of these numbers not just alleviates the work on the
   routing process, but helps more significantly when it comes to RIB/
   FIB downloading.  It reduces significantly the amount of messaging
   between the clients and RIB, and between RIB and FIB on the data
   plane.  The latter, which are real inter-machine messages, are
   particularly significant.  The proposed method moves the work around
   specifically to save that messaging.

3.2.  Procedure

   The proposed method makes a few modifications in routing/forwarding
   areas which are detailed below.  As can be seen, the changes are
   simple and light in both implementation and execution.

   1.  In SPF computation, directly use the parent node as the next hop,
       skipping inheriting the parent node's next hop.  This actually
       simplifies SPF a bit;

   2.  The RIB needs to add logic to understand and allow the non-direct
       next-hop, also called recursive next-hop.  FIB also needs to
       understand and allow the recursive next-hop.  The next-hop entry
       structure is generally unchanged.  An additional flag will have
       to be added to indicate whether a next-hop is recursive;

   3.  The data plane needs some new code:

       A.  Two FIB tables are needed in the forwarding plane, one is
           called the update-table, the other the packet-table.

       B.  The updating processor (different from the ones for
           forwarding packets), once receives updates from RIB, will
           update the entries (which are mostly recursive) onto the

           update-table, and resolve the recursive next-hops for all
           affected routes.

       C.  It will also record the parent-children relationship for
           efficient updating in the future.

       D.  When all affected routes are updated, the updating processor
           copies these entries over to the packet-table based on which
           packets are forwarded.

       E.  The packet-table requires no change per this method.  The
           forwarding throughput is intact;

   Continue using Figure 1 as an example.  Table 5 shows the FIB update-
   table for the same topology using the proposed method.

                     Table 5: Sample FIB update-table

   In Table 5, "parent" is the immediate parent node of the Destination
   "Dst".  The other two columns "nh" and "child" are empty and will be
   resolved as soon as the FIB downloading completes.  The resolution
   process walks every newly updated "Dst" entry, adds the node to the
   "child" column of its parent and inherits the next-hop from the
   parent to its "nh" column.  This resolution process literally is the
   same as the IGP routing table next-hop updating process.  The
   proposed method postpones this to the last stage of the route change
   handling, so that the volume of updating messages is minimized.  Note
   that this last stage is at the FIB update-table which is one step
   ahead of the FIB packet-table.  This insures that the FIB forwarding
   is intact as mentioned in Section 3 bullet c.

   Table 6 shows the update-table after next-hop resolution.

   which is relocated from the IGP process space, the tradeoff is the
   route change aggregation.  The scope of the routing table changes is
   contained until the last mile of the control path.

3.3.  Pseudo Code

   The conventional routing updates are illustrated in Figure 2.


     1 while (the candidate node tree (or cdt-tree) is not empty) {
     2     pick the node with lowest cost from the computing router;
     3     move this node from the cdt-tree to the final path tree;
     4     inherit the parent node's next-hop as this node's next-hop;
     5     for-each-child-node {
     6         set child-node's next-hop to this node;
     7         add the child-node to cdt-tree;
     8     }
     9 }

   The proposed method will omit line 4.

   The related FIB modification only applies to the update-table and is
   shown in Figure 3.

            1 while (fib_queue_not_empty) {
            2     if (entry == (new || changed)) {
            3         copy the entry onto update_table;
            3         mark the entry CHANGED;
            4     }
            5 }

            1 for each entry CHANGED {
            2     if (entry.parent != local_intf) {
            3         entry.nh = parent_next_hop(entry.parent);
            4         add_to_child_list(entry.parent, entry);
            5     } else {
            6         entry.nh = entry.parent;

            9     for each child node (entry) {
            10        update_child_nh(child, entry.nh);
            11    }

4.  Summary

   The proposed method purposes to move the burden of updating topology
   changes from the inter-plane communication to the intra-plane
   processing.

4.1.  Analogy

   The concept is analogous to the evolution of the IGP routing
   protocols.  Earlier the distance vector protocol such as RIP
   [RFC2453] prevails.  Routers can directly conclude best routes from
   the protocol messages.  Before long, when the topology scales up, the
   distance vector protocol is replaced by the link-state protocols such
   as OSPF [RFC2328] and IS-IS [RFC1195][ISO.10589.1992].  The key
   advantage of the link-state protocols is that the protocol messages
   only convey the local change information.  And it is the
   responsibility of every computing router to compute its best routes
   based on the information it receives.  The reduced protocol messages
   greatly improves the overall protocol response time, convergence
   speed and ability to scale.

4.2.  Trade-off

   If we perceive the control plane and the forwarding plane as two
   individual routing units, what this memo recommends is to convey the

   "link-state" based routing updates from one unit to the other.  This
   greatly reduces the control traffic volume between the two units and
   all aforementioned downloading bottlenecks become a non-issue.

   The trade-off is that the data plane will have to perform extra
   nexthop updates.  We believe that this trade-off is worthy and
   advantageous especially with the nowadays' CPU power.

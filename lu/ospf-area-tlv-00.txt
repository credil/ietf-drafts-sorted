Abstract

   For multi-area path computation, it is desirable to have the
   knowledge of the boarder areas and the corresponding boarder routers.
   This memo defines a TLV to the OSPF TE extensions to meet such need.

Internet-Draft       OSPF TE Extension for Area IDs         October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Traffic Engineering Database (TED) based on OSPF is sufficient
   for the intra-area path computation.  However because TED is of area
   scope, the path computation cannot be used for inter-area scenarios
   without the help of area boarder routers.

   Although the Router LSA offers a B bit to signify an ABR router, the
   identity of the attached area is unkown.  This will force a router to
   contact every ABRs if it wants TED info from each area.


                            West A---B---C East
                                     |\
                                     D E
                                    South

                         Figure 1: Sample Topology

   For example, as shown in Figure 1, the router B has three neighbor
   areas West, East, and South.  It can reach these areas through ABRs
   A, C, D and E. Both D and E connect to the area South.  Ideally B
   only needs to contact A, c, D (or E) to obtain TED info of the three
   areas.  However, since it does not know that D and E share the
   boarder between this area and the area South, it has to blindly send
   the request to both D and E.

   If instead each ABR provides its exit area's information, such as
   A(West), C(East), D(South), E(South), the router B will be able to
   make a sound decision to utilize only three ABRs.  For this purpose
   we define an area ID TLV, detailed in Section 2.

   Moreover since the TLV is for TE purpose, it is added under the OSPF
   TE LSA as defined in OSPF TE Extensions [RFC3630].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   LSP  - Label Switched Path

   OSPF - Open Shortest Path First

   LSA  - Link State Advertisement


2.  Area ID TLV

   [RFC3630] section 2.4 defined two TLVs.  This memo adds a third TLV,
   the Area ID TLV.

   The area ID TLV is type TBD (suggest 3), has a length of 4, and a
   value that is the four octet integer.  It may have zero or more
   occurances in one Traffic Engineering LSA originated by a router.

   The value is the area ID of an exit area for which the ABR has TE
   enabled.  An ABR may join multiple areas.  Therefore it may generate
   m-1 area ID TLVs, where m is the total number of areas the router
   joins.  For a non-ABR router, it does not have any exit area, hence
   its TE TLV has zero occurance of the area ID TLV.


3.  Applications

   With the area ID TLVs in TED, when performing inter-area path
   computation, a PCE [RFC4655] will gain additional knowledge of the
   surrounding areas and the boarder routers to reach each area.  The
   PCE may elect one boarder router for each area and request TE info
   from it.

   Alternatively, the PCE may relay the path computation job to the PCE
   which is also an ABR.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the following TLV to the OSPF TE Extensions
   under TE LSA:

            +-------------------+-------------+---------------+
            | Type              | Name        | Source        |
            +-------------------+-------------+---------------+
            | TBD (recommend 3) | Area ID TLV | This document |
            +-------------------+-------------+---------------+


6.  Security Considerations

   There are no specific security considerations within the scope of
   this document.

    Abstract 

       To reliably hand over data packets to the destination in Delay 
       Tolerant Networks (DTNs), many dissemination-based routing protocols 
       are proposed. Dissemination-based routing protocols assure nodes 
       including intermediate nodes and destinations have more chances to 
       receive packets, which will increase the probability that the packets 
       can be correctly received by the destination. However, the existing 
       error recovery mechanisms in network layer use the simple CRC to 
       check the data packets independently, and discard the error packets 
       even if one correct packet can be obtained from more than one partly 
       error packets. This document describes Dissemination-based Routing 
       Protocol with Network-layer Error Control (NER-DRP). NER-DRP divides 
       a data packet into RS blocks and inserts redundancy to each block. So 
       the intermediate nodes and destinations can recover a correct data 
       packet from multiple partially error copies of the same packet.

    1. Introduction 

       The characteristics of DTNs, such as intermittent connectivity, long 
       delay, asymmetric wireless link, make the traditional network 
       architectures and protocols, for example the TCP/IP architecture, are 
       not suitable. In recently years, some works have been conducted for 
       these networks. The DTN (Delay Tolerant Networks) architecture is 
       proposed by Delay Tolerant Network Research Group (DTNRG) of Internet 
       Research Task Force (IRTF) when they study deep space Internet 
       communications [1, 2]. DTN uses the store-and-forward message

       switching to overcome the problems associated with intermittent 
       connectivity and long delay.  
       One key issue on DTNs is to find the route to forward data packets. 
       Routing techniques in DTNs typically aim to maximize the delivery 
       ratio or to minimize the delay that each message experiences during 
       delivery [3]. Given the frequent topology dynamics both proactive and 
       reactive routing approaches fail in finding appropriate routes 
       because they attempt to find complete paths between source and 
       destination nodes, which do not exist in DTNs. So it is more 
       successful to find a route on a hop-by-hop basis. For hop-by-hop 
       routing, a next-hop node is chosen by exploiting local information 
       (also is called knowledge) about the contacts available at each hop 
       towards other nodes as well as the queues of pending messages 
       (waiting for forwarding) both at the forwarder node and at its 
       neighbour nodes. In [4,5], the authors introduces four knowledge 
       categories named oracles, contacts summary oracle, contact oracle, 
       queuing oracle and traffic demand oracle, and proposes different 
       routing algorithms, each of them using a different set of oracles. 
       Unfortunately, the assumption of availability of the oracles is not 
       actually realistic. So most of the existing routing protocols on DTNs 
       are not based on the knowledge about the future topology of the 
       network, and dissemination-based routing protocols, including 
       replication-based routing protocols [6-10], coding-based routing 
       [11,12], utility-based routing [13-16], are proposed.  
       The main problem of dissemination-based routing is that a large 
       number of copies of the same packet exist in the network, and will be 
       received and forwarded by many nodes, which exhausts the wireless 
       bandwidth resource, and wastes the energy of mobile nodes. Another 
       problem about dissemination-based routing is that the copies received 
       by the intermediate nodes and destinations, especially the partially 
       error copies, are directly dropped without fully utilization.  
       To resolve the above problems, this document describes a network 
       layer error recovery method, named NER. NER utilizes the 
       characteristic of dissemination-based routing in DTNs, i.e., more 
       than one copies can be received by the intermediate nodes and 
       destinations, to recover a correct data packet from more than one 
       partially error packets, which can increase the delivery ratio of 
       messages.  Moreover, a routing protocol integrating NER and EPI, 
       named NER-DRP, is proposed to realize error control dissemination-
       based routing in DTNs.

    2. The NER-DRP routing protocol 

       In this section, firstly the network layer error recovery method, 
       named NER, is described. Then the procedure of NER-DRP routing 
       protocol, which integrates epidemic routing and NER, is given. 
    2.1. Error recovery in network layer 

       The error recovery in network layer based on FEC, named NER, mainly 
       includes two procedures, one is the procedure in the source node, and 
       the other is the procedure in the intermediate nodes or destinations. 

    2.1.1. The procedure in the source node 

       The main function of NER in source nodes is to encapsulate messages 
       in data packets, and divide each data packet into blocks. For each 
       block, the redundant information will be added to check and correct 
       the errors in the block.  

       Although there are many error correcting codes can be used to FEC, in 
       this document, Reed Solomon (RS) is selected to illustrate the 
       procedures of NER. Figure 1 gives the several common RS code. In this 
       document, the RS (127,117) is used for showing the procedure of NER 
       in the source node.  

       The detail procedure of NER using RS code in source node is shown in 
       Figure 2. In Figure 2, the packet header is an independent block, and 
       the payload is divided to N blocks, each block is 127 octets 
       including 117 octets data and 10 octets redundancy. When length of 
       data part of the last RS block is shorter than 117 octets, complement 
       bits ??will be added. RS (127,117) code can correct up to 5 bytes 
       errors or 10 bytes errors of known location.

               Figure 2. The procedure of the packet in the source node 
        

    2.1.2. The procedure in intermediate nodes or destinations 

       The main function of NER in intermediate nodes or destinations is to 
       recover a correct data packet from one or more corrupted copies of a 
       packet. The process flow chart of NER in intermediate nodes or 
       destinations is shown in Figure 3, which mainly includes RS error 
       correction and multi-copy recombining functions. In Figure 3, the 
       variable Rcorrect shows whether a correct copy of the same packet is 
       buffered or not, and Rrev shows whether a copy of the same packet is 
       buffered or not. 

       After receiving a copy of data packet, the intermediate nodes or 
       destinations use the RS error correction function to try to correct 
       each block in that packet, and the correct blocks are buffered. 

       The multi-copy recombining is an important function, which is the 
       main difference between NER and traditional network layer function. 
       In traditional network layer, the corrupted packets will be wholly 
       discarded. In NER, the correct blocks in a data packet will be 
       buffered, and the different correct blocks in different copies of the 
       same data packet will be recombined to try to recover a correct 
       packet. Figure 4 shows an example of multi-copy recombining function, 
       in which different blocks (B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5) from three copies 
       (C1, C2, and C3) are recombined. In Figure 4, C1, C2, and C3 are 
       three copies of the same packet P, and the symbol "xx" presents that 
       the block is error.

    2.2. The NER-DRP Routing Protocol 

       The NER-DRP routing protocol works as follows. Each node maintains a 
       buffer including the packets that it has originated as well as the 
       packet that it has received. The buffered packets consist of correct 
       packets and partially error packets. All of the buffered packets 
       include RS coded blocks as mentioned in Section 2.1. A hash table 
       indexes this list of packets. For each partially error packet PKTi, a 
       corresponding timer Ti is set. The value of Ti denotes the maximum 
       time that the PKTi can be stores. When a partially error packet PKTi 
       is received at first time, Ti is set. When Ti is timeout, PKTi is 
       dropped. As in epidemic routing, each node stores a bit vector, 
       called the summary vector that indicates which entries in their local 
       hash tables are set. 

       When node A comes into contact with node B, they will initiate a 
       session to switch packet with each other. The detail that node A 
       transmits packets to node B includes the following steps. 

       Step 1: Node A transmits its summary vector, SVA to node B. SVA 
       denotes the buffered packets in node A, which including the entire 
       correct packet stand by PKTcA and the partly error packet stand by 
       PKTeA. 

       Step 2: When SVA is received, node B compares its summary vector with 
       SVA to determine the packets buffered in node A but not buffered in 
       node B as well as the packets buffered in node B with partial error.

       Then node B send request to node A to require it transmit these 
       packets.  

       Step 3: Node A transmits the required packets to Node B. 

       Step 4: For every packet received from node A, node B proceed it 
       according to procedure shown in Figure 5.

    3. Security Considerations 

       The NER-DRP block introduces no new security considerations beyond 
       two nodes should trust each other before exchanging messages. 

    4. IANA Considerations 

       This document has no IANA considerations. 

    5. Conclusions 

       This document firstly present network layer error recovery for DTNs, 
       which is named NER. NER uses RS code and multi-copy recombining 
       scheme to improve the end-to-end performance of DTNs. Although this 
       paper select RS code, we believe that NER is efficient for other FEC 
       codes. Then based on the NER, the NER-DRP routing protocol is given.  

       Although NER is only integrated to epidemic routing in this paper, we 
       can use the similar way to embed NER to other dissemination-based 
       routing protocols to improve their performance.

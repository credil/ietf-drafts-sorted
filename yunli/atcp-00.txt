       Opportunistic networks have attracted attention due to their inherent 
       characteristics, such as long latency, low data rate, and 
       intermittent connectivity. Extensive research has been conducted on 
       opportunistic networks, including the architecture, and routing. 
       However, few in the literature report the performance of TCP in 
       opportunistic networks, especially in the case of Epidemic Routing. 
       This document investigates the performance of TCP [1] in 
       opportunistic networks with Epidemic Routing. Our results show that 
       the Epidemic Routing in opportunistic networks degrades the 
       performance of TCP because multicopy data packets cause duplicate 
       ACKs, and in turn reduce the transmission rate of TCP. An enhanced 
       congestion control for TCP, named A-TCP/Reno is proposed. A-TCP/Reno 
       avoids the duplicate ACK problem caused by Epidemic Routing.

                   1. Introduction 

       Opportunistic networks [2], are defined as one type of challenged 
       networks [3], which can be encountered in many environments, such as 
       wildlife tracking: ZebraNet [4] and Shared Wireless Infostation Model 
       (SWIM) [5], Pocket Switched Networks (PSNs) [6], vehicle network: 
       CarTel [7], and opportunistic networks for developing areas such as 
       DakNet[8]. Opportunistic networks have many unique characteristics 
       different from the traditional networks, including high latency, low 
       data rate, long queuing delays, limited resources including limited 
       memory and processing capability, and intermittent connectivity 
       mainly due to motion. These characteristics render the traditional 
       network architectures and protocols ineffective.

       Opportunistic networks transmit data from the source to the 
       destination through forwarding data hop-by-hop intra node pairs. They 
       do not require that the network be fully connected that fit the needs 
       of realistic ad hoc networks and have significant influence on 
       realizing pervasive computing [9]. Therefore, opportunistic networks 
       have a variety of important applications in diverse situations.  
       In the past, performance of flooding-based routing protocols was 
       evaluated with UDP as the transport layer protocol [10, 11]. However, 
       few have investigated the performance of TCP in opportunistic 
       networks, especially when Epidemic Routing is implemented.  
       TCP is an important transport layer protocol in Internet, supporting 
       End-to-End reliable transmission and congestion control, and used by 
       many Internet applications, such as FTP, Email, and Web services. 
       Therefore, it is important to investigate the performance of TCP in 
       opportunistic networks as well. 
       In this document, we first discuss the performance of TCP with 
       Epidemic Routing in opportunistic networks. The Epidemic Routing [12] 
       in opportunistic networks degrades the performance of TCP due to 
       multicopy data packets causing duplicate ACKs. Then an enhanced 
       algorithm for TCP, which we call A-TCP/Reno is proposed to resolve 
       the problem. 
        
                   2. Enhanced Congestion Control for TCP in Opportunistic 
                      Networks 

       In this section, the problem of TCP in opportunistic networks is 
       discussed. Then enhancement for the TCP is given. 
    2.1. The problem of TCP in opportunistic networks 

       Epidemic Routing for opportunistic networks makes message 
       transmission transmitted in the network in many ways similar to the 
       viral transmission. Under ideal conditions, such as unlimited 
       bandwidth, buffer, and energy, Epidemic Routing can perform well. 
       However, its performance is poor when TCP/Reno is implemented. 
       Because of the mobility of nodes, opportunistic network may have a 
       link failure which leads to intermittent connectivity, which in turn 
       degrades network performance. Also because Epidemic Routing is a 
       multipath routing scheme, there are possibly many copies of the same 
       packets in the network which result in receiving multiple copies at 
       the destination. The receiver must send an ACK upon receiving a 
       message, regardless of whether they are duplicate messages or not, 
       therefore the destination node would send multiple ACKs. At the same 
       time, it is possible that the source node receives multiple copies of 
       the ACK. Once the third duplicate ACK is received, the fast

       retransmit algorithm will be triggered. As a result, the fast 
       retransmit triggered by multipath routing rather than the actual data 
       loss increases the overhead and degrades overall performance of the 
       network. 

    2.2. Enhanced Congestion Control for The TCP 

       As we noticed from the previous section, there can be a large number 
       of duplicate packets in opportunistic networks when TCP/Reno is 
       combined with Epidemic Routing. In order to improve the performance 
       by decreasing the number of duplicate ACKs caused by multicopy data 
       packets, we proposed an enhanced algorithm for the TCP. The details 
       of A-TCP/Reno algorithm are shown in Figure 1. 

       In TCP/Reno, the receiver must send an ACK upon receiving a packet, 
       regardless of whether it is a duplicate packet or not. But in A-
       TCP/Reno, the receiver will check the packet and confirms in a self-
       adaptive manner. Only if it is a duplicate packet and also the time 
       interval between Ti (the time of the packet received for the i-th 
       time) and T0 (the time of the packet received for the first time) is 
       greater than alpha*RTO (  is a fixed multiplier), or else if it is 
       not a duplicate packet, the receiver will send an ACK. 

       In opportunistic networks, different types of duplicate packets can 
       be processed distinctively. We classify the duplicate packets into 
       two groups: 

       Group 1: isdup_==TRUE and Ti-T0 > alpha *RTO: A duplicate packet is 
       received and the time interval between Ti and T0 is greater than 
        *RTO. That is, the duplicate packet received is a retransmitted 
       packet by the sender, rather than a duplicate packet caused by 
       multipath routing. So it is necessary to send an acknowledgement for 
       the packet.  

       Group 2: isdup_==TRUE and Ti-T0< alpha * RTO: It is the opposite of 
       Group 1. The received packet is a duplicate packet caused by 
       multicopy data packets. In this case, no ACK is sent because a 
       corresponding ACK has been sent when the TCP packet was received at 
       the destination for the first time. 

       In Group 1, the duplicate packet received at the destination is a 
       packet retransmitted by the sender. That indicates that the source 
       node has not received the corresponding ACK in time, or perhaps did 
       not receive it at all. At this moment, if no acknowledgement was sent 
       by the destination, this would result in retransmission repeatedly 
       owing to no ACK arriving at the source. So it is necessary to send an 
       acknowledgement. But in Group 2, the destination has sent an

       acknowledgement for the packet whose copies are generated caused by 
       multipath routing when received for the first time. Dropping them 
       directly will reduce redundant packets and save resources, which also 
       prevents possible congestion, such as fast retransmit triggered by 
       three sequential duplicate ACKs. As a result, lower overhead and 
       improved performance is expected.

       The A-TCP/Reno block introduces no new security considerations beyond 
       two nodes should trust each other before exchanging messages.

       This document firstly discusses TCP performance in opportunistic 
       networks especially when Epidemic Routing is used. Then an enhanced 
       algorithm, A-TCP/Reno, is introduced. A-TCP/Reno requires that the 
       destination does not send ACK for the duplicate messages. Since there 
       are fewer redundant ACKs in the network and congestion control does

      Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata Format
                    draft-ram-siprec-metadata-format-02

Abstract

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document focuses on the Recording metadata
   format which describes the communication session.

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata                June 2011


1.  Introduction

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  The requirements for such recording is described
   in [I-D.ietf-siprec-req], the related architecture is described in
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture], and the metadata model viewed by
   Session Recording Server is described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata].
   This document focuses on the Recording metadata format which
   describes the communication session.  The delivery mechanism for
   passing metadata is outside the scope of this document.

   The Session Recording Client (SRC) initiates the Recording Session.
   Here, Recording Session is a completely independent from the
   Communication Session that is being recorded at both the SIP dialog
   level and at the session level.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs.


3.  Recording Metadata Format

   Recording Metadata is the data that describes the communication
   session.  Metadata has to be conveyed from SRC to SRS, further the
   metadata MAY be conveyed in the Recording Session dialog.  Few
   metadata information SHALL be derived from RS dialog.  Recording
   dialog-id SHALL be used as recording specific unique id, Date header
   SHALL be used as start and stop time of recording metadata block.

   The media related details of metadata SHALL be passed across using
   session description protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].  SDP attributes
   describes about different media formats like audio, video.  The other
   metadata attributes like participant details MUST be passed across in
   new Recording specific XML document namely application/
   rs-metadata+xml.  The linkage between application/rs-metadata+xml XML
   schema and metadata SDP is done using the SDP label attribute
   (a=label:xxx) referenced in [RFC4574].

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata                June 2011


   Metadata is passed across in Recording Session(RS) incrementally
   whenever there is a change in CS.


4.  SIP Recording Metadata document format

4.1.  Contents

   Recording Metadata document is an XML document which will be embedded
   as a message body.  The document contains

   o  recording element MUST present in all recording metadata XML
      document. recording acts as container for all other elements in
      this XML document.
   o  Elements like session, participant, stream and group are under
      recording element directly with appropriate parent id and have
      separate URN UUID for passing the partial information of metadata.
      In case of partial metadata, recording element and the relevant
      updated elements will be passed by SRC and the elements are
      identified in SRS using URN UUID and parent id.
   o  Group element is an optional element provides the information
      about the communication session group
   o  Session element provides the information about the communication
      session
   o  Participant element provides information regarding the specific
      participant involved in the recording
   o  Stream element indicates SDP media lines associated with the
      session and participants
   o  Extensiondata element provides the mechanism by which namespace/
      element MAY be extended with standard or proprietary information.

4.2.  XML data format

   Recording object is a XML document.  It MUST have the XML declaration
   and it SHOULD contain an encoding declaration in the XML declaration,
   e.g., "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>".  If the charset
   parameter of the MIME content type declaration is present and it is
   different from the encoding declaration, the charset parameter takes
   precedence.

   Every application conforms to this specification MUST accept the
   UTF-8 character encoding to ensure the minimal interoperability.

   Syntax and semantics error in recording XML document has to be
   informed to the originator using application specific mechanism.

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata                June 2011


4.2.1.  Namespace

   The namespace URI for elements defined by this specification is a
   Uniform Resource Namespace (URN) [RFC2141], using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf' defined by [RFC2648] and extended by [RFC3688].

   The URN is as follows: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:recording

4.2.2.  recording

   recording element MUST contain an xmlns namespace attribute with
   value as urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:siprec.  One recording element MUST
   present in the all recording metadata XML document.

   recording element has group, session, stream, participant elements.

   dataMode element shows whether the XML document is complete document
   or partial update.  The default value is complete.

4.2.3.  group

   Each communication session group (CSG) is represented using one group
   element.  Each group element has unique URN UUID attribute which
   helps to uniquely identify CSG.

4.2.4.  session

   Each communication session(CS) has one session element.  Each session
   element has unique URN UUID attribute which helps to uniquely
   identify CS.

   Reason element MAY be included to indicate the reason for
   termination. group-ref element MAY exist to indicate the group where
   the mentioned session belongs.

4.2.5.  participant

   Each communication session user is defined by one participant element
   and there MUST be atleast 2 participant for any given session. "send"
   or "receive" element in each participant is associating SDP m-lines
   with the participant. send element indicates that participant is
   sending the stream of media with the mentioned media description.
   recv element indicates that participant is receiving the stream and
   by default all participant will receive the stream. recv element has
   relevance in case whisper call scenario wherein few of the
   participant in the session receives the stream and not others.

   Participant MUST have AOR element which contains SIP/SIPS URI to

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata                June 2011


   identify the participant.  AOR element is SIP/SIPS URI FQDN or IP
   address which represents the user. name is an optional element to
   represent display name.

   Each participant element has unique URN UUID attribute which helps to
   uniquely identify participant and session URN UUID to associate
   participant with specific session element.  URN UUID of participant
   *MUST* used in the scope of CSG and no new URN UUID has to be created
   for the same element (participant, stream) between different CS in
   the same CSG.  In case URN UUID has to be used permanent, careful
   usage of URN UUID to original AoR has to be decided by the
   implementers and it is implementer's choice.

4.2.6.  stream

   This element indicates the SDP m-line properties like label
   attributes, media mode.  Label attribute is used to link m-line SDP
   body using label attribute in SDP m-line.  The media mode helps in
   understanding whether the media is mixed or not.

   Each stream element has unique URN UUID attribute which helps to
   uniquely identify stream and session URN UUID to associate stream
   with specific session element.  The open item here is whether to use
   URN UUID (global id) or xml:id (local id).

4.2.7.  extensiondata

   extensiondata element SHALL include any other XML namespace.
   Multiple namespace MAY exists under extensiondata. extensiondata
   element exist in each level like recording, session, participant,
   stream to provide extensiondata specific to each element.
   extensiondata element has unique id based on URN UUID [RFC4122]
   attribute and its parent id.  The open item in extensiondata is
   whether any need of separate metadata block or not.

4.2.8.  start-time/stop-time

   start-time/stop-time contains a string indicating the date and time
   of the status change of this tuple.  The value of this element MUST
   follow the IMPP datetime format [RFC3339].  Timestamps that contain
   'T' or 'Z' MUST use the capitalized forms.  At a time, any of the
   time tuple start-time or stop-time MAY exist in the element namely
   group, session, participant, stream and not both timestamp at the
   same time.

   As a security measure, the timestamp element SHOULD be included in
   all tuples unless the exact time of the status change cannot be
   determined.

7.  Example with SIP and metadata XML+SDP

   This section describes the different use cases/messages for
   delivering Metadata in a Recording Sessions.  This section is written
   in the draft for better readability and the example will be moved to
   solution document or removed when this draft is adopted as WG item.

7.1.  SRC Initiated Recording

   An SRC initiates Recording Session(RS) for recording a communication
   session with audio and video media.  SRC initiates the dialog by
   sending an INVITE request to the SRS.  INVITE is formed as specified
   in [RFC3261] , SRC inserts recording metadata as an XML document and
   SDP in multipart MIME message body [RFC2046].  The content type of
   SIP header is set to application/rs-metadata+xml
   [I-D.portman-siprec-protocol].  SRC MUST form SDP offer using the
   normal procedures defined in [RFC3261]and [RFC3264].  SRC SHALL
   include one m-line for each stream of each participant.  If the
   recording has to be started immediately then SRC MUST include an SDP
   attribute of "a=sendonly" for each media line or "a=inactive" if it
   is not ready to transmit the media.  SRC MAY also include only one
   m-line for all streams of same type for all participants depending on
   whether it has the capability to mix the streams.  SRC indicates the
   modes (mixed or single) for each stream using a mode attribute.  An
   example wherein INVITE sent by an SRC is shown below:

8.  Security Considerations

   The metadata information sent from SRC to SRS MAY reveal sensitive
   information about different participants in a session.  For this
   reason, it is RECOMMENDED that a SRC use a strong means for
   authentication and metadata information protection and that it apply
   comprehensive authorization rules when using the metadata format
   defined in this document.  The following sections will discuss each
   of these aspects in more detail.

8.1.  Connection Security

   It is RECOMMENDED that a SRC authenticate SRS using the normal SIP
   authentication mechanisms, such as Digest as defined in Section 22 of
   [RFC3261].  The mechanism used for conveying the metadata information
   MUST ensure integrity and SHOULD ensure confidentially of the
   information.  In order to achieve these, an end-to-end SIP encryption
   mechanism, such as S/MIME described in [RFC3261], SHOULD be used.

   If a strong end-to-end security means (such as above) is not
   available, it is RECOMMENDED that a SRC use mutual hop-by-hop
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication and encryption
   mechanisms described in "SIPS URI Scheme" and "Interdomain Requests"
   of [RFC3261].

   TBD: Other detailed security aspects


9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a new XML namespace, and a new XML
   schema.

9.1.  SIP recording metadata Schema Registration

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:recording

   Registrant Contact: IETF SIPREC working group, Ram mohan
   R(rmohanr@cisco.com)

   XML: the XML schema to be registered is contained in Section 6.

   Its first line is <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> and its last
   line is </xs:schema>


10.  Acknowledgement

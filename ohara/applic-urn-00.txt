ICT Platform Project in Japan
                       draft-ohara-applic-urn-00

Abstract

 This document describes the Namespace Idendifier (NID) 'applic' for 
 Uniform Resource Name (URN) which is used to identify resources released 
 by the Association for Promotion of Public Local Information and 
 Communication (APPLIC).  APPLIC publishes and manages specifications 
 that define unique and persistent resources which make use of the namespace.
 (APPLIC is a nonprofit organization which consists of local governments, 
 private companies and academic experts in Japan.)

1. Introduction

 In order to realize the improvement of public services for citizens and the
 reduction of ICT costs for local governments in japan, APPLIC has started 
 the Local Government ICT Platform project(*1) according to one of the 
 Japanese government policies(*2).

 In this project APPLIC has set the standard specifications for various 
 services and exchanged data items between local governments, between local 
 government and private enterprise, which are based on the concept of SOA, 
 and has published them(*3).(and will upgrade them when necessary.)

 The XML schemas and WSDL files on the services also are included in the 
 specifications, and NamespaceID on them has to be registered formaly and to
 be unique.

2. Specification Template

   NamespaceID:  "applic"


Registration Information:

   Version 1
   Date:  2011-01-14


Declared registrant of the namespace:

   Name(Organization): The Association for Promotion of Public Local
                       Information and Communication (APPLIC)
   Address: 2-9-4,Torano-mon,Minato-ward,Tokyo 105-0001,Japan
   E-mail: tech-ans@applic.or.jp
   URL: http://www.applic.or.jp/


Declaration of syntactic structure:

  The identifier structure is as follows:

  urn: <namespace ID>:xmlns:pf:<the classification of the specification>:
       <the classification of the document type>:<the information of the 
       specification release>

  <namespace ID> is "applic"

  <the classification of the specification>
   is "dis" | "gis" | "lgxml" | "interop" | "common"

  <the classification of the document type> is "schema" | "wsdl" | "bpel"

  <the information of the specification release time> is YYYY-**

     YYYY : the year of the specification release
      **  : the time of the specification release in the year,
            which is from "01" to "99"


Relevant ancillary documentation :

   The specification documents and XML schemas are published on the 
   following site:
   http://www.applic.or.jp/

   (e.g. The latest version at 2010/10 is published on the following page.)
   ( http://www.applic.or.jp/URN/APPLIC-0009-2010/ )



Identifier uniqueness considerations:

    URN identifiers are assigned uniquely.
      -- APPLIC assigns them to at most one resource according to above 
         syntactic structure, and do not reassign.


Identifier persistence considerations:

    All identifier assignments are permanent by APPLIC.


Process of identifier assignment:

    The assignment process is completely closed one under APPLIC control.


Process for identifier resolution:

    APPLIC will maintain lists of assigned identifiers on its web pages or 
   documents. (http://www.applic.or.jp/)


Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

    The entire URN is case-insensitive.

Conformance with URN Syntax:

    No special considerations.


Validation mechanism:

    No special considerations.


Scope:

    Global.



3. Example

  (The following examples are not to be real.)

  urn:applic:xmlns:pf:lgxml:wsdl:2016-01
  urn:applic:xmlns:pf:common:schema:2020-03



4. Namespace Considerations

 In order to guarantee the uniqueness of URNs, the assignment process of 
 them is completely closed one under APPLIC control and in fact APPLIC 
 assigns them according to the above "Declaration of syntactic structure"
 in "2. Specification Template" and publishes them.



5. Community Considerations

 In Japan software development companies implement the functions of the 
 Local Government ICT Platform specifications (including XML schemas 
 and WSDL files) into their software products for local governments and 
 release them.  Local governments need to design their services by using 
 them in order to communicate with each other on the Local Government 
 ICT Platform.
 The software products in accordance with the specifications can be 
 passed by APPLIC and published on the following APPLIC web page.
 http://www.applic.or.jp/pf/entry/unit.html.

 Any organization such as local governments and private enterprises will 
 be entitled to access the namespace and its associated application, 
 registration and resolution services.  The primary "applic" namespace 
 usage is to identify information resources, such as XML messages, 
 according to the Local Government ICT Platform specifications.



6. IANA Considerations

 This document includes a URN NID registration for APPLIC for entry in 
 the IANA registry of URN NIDs (see [RFC2434] for more information).

 (APPLIC indicates in the document "Standard Specification regarding 
  Platform Communication", one of the Local Government ICT Platform 
  documents, that The NamespaceID "applic" is entered into the IANA 
  registry of URN NIDs.)



7. Security Considerations

 There are no additional security considerations except those of the use 
 and resolution of URNs in general.

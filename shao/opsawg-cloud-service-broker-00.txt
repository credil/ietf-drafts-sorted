1.  Introduction

   As specified in the NIST Reference Architecture [NIST RA]document,
   Cloud Broker is an entity manages the use, performance and delivery
   of cloud services, and negotiates relationships between Cloud
   Providers and Cloud Consumers.

   As specified in the CSAguide [CSAguide] document, Cloud service
   broker offers intermediation, monitoring, transformation/portability,
   governance, provisioning, and integration services and negotiate
   relationships between various cloud providers and consumers.  Cloud
   service broker will emerge as an important component in the overall
   cloud ecosystem.  It will abstract these possibly incompatible
   capabilities and interfaces on behalf of consumers to provide proxy
   in advance of the arrival of common, open and standardized ways of
   solving the problem longer term with a semantic capability that
   allows fluidity and agility in a Consumer being able to take
   advantage of the model that works best for their particular needs.

   As specified in the CCUCWP [CCUCWP] document, A broker has no cloud
   resources of its own, but matches consumers and providers based on
   the SLA required by the consumer.  The consumer has no knowledge that
   the broker does not control the resources.

   The simplest deployment view is illustrated in Figure 1.

                       Figure 1: Basic Architecture

   A Cloud Service Broker (CSB) can provide brokering service for
   different Cloud Service Providers which can base on private cloud,
   community cloud, public cloud and hybrid cloud.  CSB offers
   intermediation, proxy, monitoring, transformation, portability,
   governance,provisioning, screening, substitution, security,
   composition services and negotiate relationships between various
   Cloud Service Providers and Cloud Service Requesters(consumers).
   Cloud Service Requesters (consumers) can be any web services,
   applications, users (e.g. enterprise users or public consume users),
   even a cloud.  A cloud can through CSB to interworking with other
   clouds.

   A CSB can alliance with different clouds, the CSB integrates and
   composes cloud services by orchestrating the cloud resources and
   services across various cloud domain and Cloud Service Providers,
   offers guaranteed cloud services to consumers with SLA.

   In the cloud ecosystem, the Cloud Service Requesters(consumers) can
   through CSB to access cloud computing services and resources of Cloud
   Service Providers.  When CSB receives the cloud service consumer
   requests from Cloud Service Requesters, it will select appropriate
   cloud computing services and resources by Cloud Service Providers and
   specific function pattern to execute related cloud service operations
   such as intermediation,proxy,monitoring, transformation/portability,
   governance, provisioning, screening, substitution, security,
   composition services.  CSB will invoke and adapt to the concrete
   cloud services and resources from various Cloud Service Providers,
   and return consumer response to Cloud Service Requesters.

          Figure 2: Cloud Service Broker Functional  Architecture

   CSB reference architecture functional groups consists of cloud
   service consumer interface module, cloud service publish interface
   module, cloud service orchestration module and cloud service adapter
   module.

3.1.  Cloud service publish interface

   Cloud service publish interface is used to provide different cloud
   computing service and resource information for CSB.  Through cloud
   service publish interface, the CSB can subscribe different cloud
   computing service and resource information from Cloud Service
   Providers on demand by sending cloud service subscription request and
   receiving cloud service notification from Cloud Service Providers to
   get these information.  The published information can be any
   Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) information, Platform as a
   service(PaaS) information, Software as a service(SaaS) information
   and Data Storage as a service(DSaaS) information.  Cloud Service
   Providers (e.g. private cloud, community cloud, public cloud and

Internet-Draft            Cloud Service Broker                 June 2011


   hybrid cloud) can notify their published information to CSB.

   The subscription/notification can synchronize with the cloud service
   consumer requests.  In dynamic composition service function pattern,
   when CSB receives the cloud service consumer requests from Cloud
   Service Requesters, CSB can first subscribe the actual cloud service
   from Cloud Service Providers based on the abstract service logic,
   then transfer to the concrete service logic to find the concrete
   services that can fulfil the requirements to replace the service
   classes and create invoking information for these services.  Then the
   CSB executes the concrete service logic and gets the results of these
   concrete services.  The CSB then produces the final result and
   returns it to Cloud Service Requesters.  The subscription/
   notification can also asynchronous working with the CSB other
   operations.

3.2.  Cloud Service Consumer Interface

   The Cloud Service Requesters (consumers like web services,
   applications, users, cloud) can through CSB Cloud Service Consumer
   Interface to access Cloud Service Providers' cloud computing services
   and resources.  It can receive cloud service consumer requests from
   Cloud Service Requesters and return cloud service consumer responses
   to Cloud Service Requesters.

3.3.  Cloud service process

   The cloud service process module is used to process the cloud service
   consumer requests from Cloud Service Requesters.  It can receive the
   requests by Cloud Service Consumer Interface, analysis the requested
   cloud services, select appropriate service logics and function
   patterns based on CSB database information from subscription or
   internal integration, execute related operations, then invoke and
   adapt to the concrete cloud services and resources from various Cloud
   Service Providers through cloud service adapters by sending cloud
   service adaptation requests to Cloud Service Providers and receiving
   cloud service adaptation responses from Cloud Service Providers.

   The cloud service process module basic function pattern is
   transformation/ translation, that is transfer or translate between
   the Cloud Service Requesters' cloud service consumer requests/
   responses and cloud service adaptation requests/ responses for Cloud
   Service Providers.  CSB can provide proxy service or Service
   Intermediation which is defined in NIST  Reference Architecture [NIST
   RA].

   Upon the basic function pattern, the cloud service process module can
   provide advanced function patterns, such as security service, QoS/SLA

   control service, screening service, substitution service, and
   composition service.  For composition service, the cloud service
   process module make static service composition and dynamic service
   composition.  The static service composition is equal to Service
   Aggregation and the dynamic service composition is equal to Service
   Arbitrage specified in the NIST Reference Architecture [NIST RA].

3.4.  Cloud service adapter

   The cloud service adapter module is used to adapt cloud services and
   resources from Cloud Service Providers according to the cloud service
   consuming requests from CSRs, it will transfer and map protocols and
   formats supported by Cloud Service Providers' services and resources
   including APIs, parameters and transmission protocols.  The cloud
   service adapter module consists of IaaS adapter module, DSaaS adapter
   module, PaaS adapter module, SaaS adapter module.

   As discussed in previous sections in this document, the intention is
   to provide a toolkit for a variety of deployment architectures where
   Cloud Service broker can take place.  As a result, two main
   interfaces are required to support the differing requirements.  The
   two interfaces are described in the remainder of this section and
   have been named the 'Cloud Service Publish' and 'Cloud Service
   Consumer' interfaces.  These two interfaces have extremely differing
   responsibilities and usages which is reflected in the choice of
   solutions.

   This includes interpreting the data for the Cloud Service Consumer
   interface and the Cloud Service Publish interface.  It is, however,
   important that the two interfaces are complimentary so that
   development of appropriate CSB functionality is supported.

4.1.  Cloud Service Publish Interface

   The Cloud Service Publish interface is responsible for providing an
   CSB with appropriate Cloud Service and resource information.

   Service flow of cloud service subscription include: CSB send cloud
   service subscription request to Cloud Service Providers using Publish
   interface message Package within request message for subscription of
   cloud services from Cloud Service Providers.  CSB receive response
   reply by Cloud Service Providers for acceptance or fail reasons.

   Service flow of cloud service notification include: Cloud Service
   Providers send notification to CSB using Publish interface message
   Package within notification message for publishing cloud services.
   CSB return response to Cloud Service Providers for acceptance or fail
   reasons.

4.1.1.  HTTP Publish Interface Usage

   The following description will describe the use of HTTP [RFC2616] and
   HTTPS [RFC2818] as transport for a subscription/notification and the
   appropriate response.

   The cloud service subscription request, as defined by the
   <subscription>element of <csbrequest> element from Section 6, MUST be
   carried in the body of an HTTP/HTTPS request.  The MIME type
   contained in the HTTP/HTTPS request/response MUST be 'application/
   csb-publish+xml'.  This value MUST be reflected in the appropriate
   HTTP headers like 'Content-Type' and 'Accept'.  The body of the HTTP/
   HTTPS request MUST only contain the 'csbrequest' element as defined
   in Section 6.  The 'csbrequest' element is the primary container of

   information related to a Cloud service subscription request.

   The Cloud service subscription response, as defined by the
   <csbresponse> element from Section 6, MUST be carried in the body of
   an HTTP/HTTPS 200 response to the original HTTP/HTTPS request.  The
   MIME type contained in the HTTP/HTTPS request/response MUST be
   'application/csb-publish+xml'.  This value MUST be reflected in the
   appropriate HTTP headers like 'Content-Type' and 'Accept'.  The body
   of the HTTP/HTTPS 200 response MUST only contain the 'csbresponse'
   element as defined in Section 6.  The 'csbresponse' element is the
   primary container of information related to a Cloud service
   subscription response.

   The cloud service notification, as defined by the
   <csbnotification>element from Section 6, MUST be carried in the body
   of an HTTP/HTTPS request.  The MIME type contained in the HTTP/HTTPS
   request/response MUST be 'application/csb-publish+xml'.  This value
   MUST be reflected in the appropriate HTTP headers like 'Content-Type'
   and 'Accept'.  The body of the HTTP/HTTPS request MUST only contain
   the 'csbnotification' element as defined in Section 6.  The
   'csbnotification' element is the primary container of information
   related to a Cloud service notification.

   CSB can map existing HTTP verbs to operation for accessing and
   controling an appropriate Cloud Service and resource.  POST map to
   Create operation, GET map to Retrieve operation, PUT map to Create or
   Update operation, DELETE map to Delete operation.

4.1.2.  Publish interface Message Package Definition

      previous 'seqnumber' value.  The attribute MUST be present.

   action:  provides the operation that should be carried out on the
      subscription:

      *  The value of 'create' instructs the Cloud Service Provider to
         attempt to setup a new subscription.

      *  The value of 'update' instructs the Cloud Service Provider to
         attempt to update an existing subscription.

      *  The value of 'remove' instructs the Cloud Service Provider to

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

                     Table 1: <response> status codes

   In case a new subscription request made by an csb (action='create')
   has been accepted, the Cloud Service Provider MUST reply with a
   <csbresponse> with status code 200.  The same rule applies whenever a
   request to update (action='update') or remove (action='remove')
   anexisting transac tion can be fulfilled by the Cloud Service
   Provider.

   A subscription request, nevertheless, may fail for several reasons.
   In such a case, the status codes defined in Table 1 must be used
   instead.

   Specifically, if the Cloud Service Provider fails to handle a request
   due to a syntax error in the request itself (e.g., incorrext XML,
   violation of the schema constraints or invalid values in any of the
   attributes/elements) the Cloud Service Provider MUST reply with a
   <csbresponse> with status code 400.

   If a syntactically correct request fails because the request also
   includes any attribute/element the Cloud Service Provider doesn't
   understand, the Cloud Service Provider MUST reply with a
   <csbresponse> with status code 420.

Internet-Draft            Cloud Service Broker                 June 2011


   If a syntactically correct request fails because the csb wants to
   create a new subscription, but the provided intended id for the
   subscription already exists, the Cloud Service Provider MUST reply
   with a <csbresponse> with status code 405.

   If a syntactically correct request failes because the csb wants to
   update/remove a subscription that doesn't exist, the Cloud Service
   Provider MUST reply with a <csbresponse> with status code 404.

   If the Cloud Service Provider is unable to accept a request for any
   other reason (e.g., the csb has no more resources to fulfil the
   request), the Cloud Service Provider MUST reply with a <csbresponse>
   with status code 401/402/403, depending on the action the csb
   provided in its request:

   o  action='create' --> 401;

   o  action='update' --> 402;

   o  action='remove' --> 403;

   As explained in Section 4.1.2.2.1, even in case of an accepted
   subscription request the Cloud Service Provider might change the
   suggested 'expires' and 'frequency' values provided by the csb in its
   <csbrequest>, if it considers them unacceptable (e.g., the requested
   frequency is too high).  In such a case, the Cloud Service Provider
   MUST add an additional <subscription> element to the response,
   including the updated values, to inform the csb about the change.
   The Cloud Service Provider MAY include such element if the values
   have been accepted or were omitted in the request.

4.2.  Cloud Service Consumer Interface

   The Cloud Service Consumer interface provides the ability for
   requesters such as WEB service, applications, users to access and
   control an appropriate Cloud Service and resource by Cloud Service
   Provider to satisfy specific criteria.  CSB receives cloud service
   consumer request from Cloud Service Requesters using Consumer
   interface message Package within Cloud service request message, the
   message include detailed demand cloud service information of Cloud
   Service Requester to the CSB.  CSB returns cloud service consumer
   responses to Cloud Service Requesters using Consumer interface
   message Package within response message, the message include CSB's
   feedback information which CSB make an informed decision and provide
   the requester with an appropriate Cloud Service Provider's cloud
   service and resource.

4.2.1.  HTTP Consumer Interface Usage

   The following information explains the primary operations required to
   request and then receive information from an csb.  The following
   description will describe the use of HTTP [RFC2616] and HTTPS
   [RFC2818] as transport for a request for cloud resource and the
   appropriate response.

   The cloud resource request, as defined by the <CloudResourceRequest>
   element from Section 7, MUST be carried in the body of an HTTP/HTTPS
   request.  The MIME type contained in the HTTP/HTTPS request/response
   MUST be 'application/csb-consumer+xml'.  This value MUST be reflected
   in the appropriate HTTP headers like 'Content-Type' and 'Accept'.
   The body of the HTTP/HTTPS request MUST only contain the
   'CloudResourceRequest' element as defined in Section 7.  The
   'CloudResourceRequest' element is the primary container of
   information related to a Cloud resource request.

   The Cloud resource response, as defined by the
   <CloudResourceResponse> element from Section 7, MUST be carried in
   the body of an HTTP/HTTPS 200 response to the original HTTP/HTTPS
   request.  The MIME type contained in the HTTP/HTTPS request/response
   MUST be 'application/csb-consumer+xml'.  This value MUST be reflected
   in the appropriate HTTP headers like 'Content-Type' and 'Accept'.
   The body of the HTTP/HTTPS 200 response MUST only contain the
   'CloudResourceResponse' element as defined in Section 7.  The
   'CloudResourceResponse' element is the primary container of
   information related to a Cloud resource response.

   CSB can map existing HTTP verbs to operation for accessing and
   controling an appropriate Cloud Service and resource.  POST map to
   Create operation, GET map to Retrieve operation, PUT map to Create or
   Update operation, DELETE map to Delete operation, COPY map to
   Duplicate operation,HEAD map to Retrieve Metadata Only operation,
   MOVE map to Relocate operation, and OPTIONS verbs represents a
   request for information about the communication options available on
   the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI.

4.2.2.  Consumer interface Message Package Definition

   This Consumer interface Message package is uesd for cloud services
   consumer information interaction between Cloud Service Requesters and
   CSB.

   This section defines the XML elements for the Consumer interface.
   The formal XML schema definition for the Consumer interface can be
   found in Section 7.

   of which is allowed to occur.

      <CloudServiceRequest> for sending a Consumer request.  See
      Section 4.2.2.1.

      <CloudServiceResponse> for sending a Consumer response.  See
      Section 4.2.2.2.

4.2.2.1.  <CloudServiceRequest> element

   The <CloudServiceRequest> element provides a container for requester
   wishing to access and control cloud service resource from an external
   csb entity.

   The <CloudServiceRequest> element has the following child element.

      <session-info> for cloud resource session information.  See
      Section 4.2.2.3.

                     Table 2: <response> status codes

   In case a new cloud service request made by an requester has been
   accepted, the Cloud MUST reply with a <CloudServiceResponse> with
   status code 200 and the feedback cloud service information elements
   such as <IaaS> element, <PaaS> element, <SaaS> element, <DSaaS>
   element.  The same rule applies whenever a request to update
   (action='update') or remove (action='remove') an existing transaction
   can be fulfilled by the csb.

   A cloud service request, nevertheless, may fail for several reasons.
   In such a case, the status codes defined in Table 1 must be used
   instead.

   Specifically, if the csb fails to handle a request due to a syntax
   error in the request itself (e.g., incorrext XML, violation of the
   schema constraints or invalid values in any of the attributes/
   elements) the csb MUST reply with a <CloudServiceResponse> with
   status code 400.

   If a syntactically correct request fails because the request also
   includes any attribute/element the csb doesn't understand, the csb
   MUST reply with a <CloudServiceResponse> with status code 420.

   If a syntactically correct request fails because the csb couldn't
   find any Cloud able to fulfil the requirements presented by the
   requester in its request, the csb MUST reply with a
   <CloudServiceResponse> with status code 408.

   If a syntactically correct request fails because the csb couldn't

   update an existing request according to the new requirements
   presented by the requester in its request, the csb MUST reply with a
   <CloudServiceResponse> with status code 409.

   If a syntactically correct request fails because the csb couldn't
   remove an existing request and release the related resources as
   requested by the requester, the csb MUST reply with a
   <CloudServiceResponse> with status code 410.

   The <CloudServiceResponse> element has the following child element.

      <response-session-info> for cloud resource session information.
      See Section 4.2.2.5.

      <IaaS> for IaaS resource information .  See Section 4.2.2.6.

      <PaaS> for PaaS resource information .  See Section 4.2.2.7.

      <SaaS> for SaaS resource information .  See Section 4.2.2.8.

      <DSaaS> for DSaaS resource information .  See Section 4.2.2.9.

      <encryption> for encryption .  See Section 4.2.2.4.

4.2.2.3.  <session-info> element

   The <session-info> element is included in Consumer requests when an
   update is being made to an existing cloud resource session.  The
   element MAY be present.

   The <session-info> element has no attributes.

   The <session-info> element has the following child elements:

   session-id:   is a unique identifier that explicitly references an
      existing cloud resource session on the csb.  The identifier is
      included to update the existing session.

   seq:   is used in association with the <session-id> element in a
      subsequent request to update an existing cloud resource session on
      an csb.  The <seq> number is incremented from its original value
      returned in response to the initial request for cloud resources.

   action:   provides the operation that should be carried out on an
      existing cloud resource session on an csb:

      *  The value of 'update' instructs the csb to attempt to update
         the existing cloud resource session.

   whether use encrypting or not, 'true' or 'false'.  The element MAY be
   present.

   The <encryption> element has no attributes.

   The <encryption> element has no child elements.

4.2.2.5.  <response-session-info> element

   The <response-session-info> element is included in Consumer
   responses.  This applies to responses to both requests for new
   resources and requests to update an existing cloud resource session.
   The element MAY be present: specifically, the element MUST be
   included in case the request was successful, while it would not
   appear otherwise (e.g., in case the request ended up with an error).

   The <response-session-info> element has no attributes.

   The <response-session-info> element has the following child elements:

   session-id:   is a unique identifier that explicitly references an
      existing cloud resource session on the csb.  The identifier is
      included to update the existing session.

   seq:   is used in association with the <session-id> element in a
      subsequent request to update an existing cloud resource session on
      an csb.  The <seq> number is incremented from its original value
      returned in response to the initial request for cloud resources.

   expires:   includes the number of seconds that the cloud resources
      are reserved as part of this interaction.  If the lease is not
      refreshed before expiry, the csb will re-claim the resources and
      they will no longer be guaranteed.  It is RECOMMENDED that a
      minimum value of 300 seconds be used for the value of the
      'expires' attribute.  It is also RECOMMENDED that a requester
      refresh the lease at an interval that is not too close to the
      expiry time.  A value of 80% of the timeout period could be used.

   Cloud-service-URI:   is the URI to reach the Cloud handling the
      requested service resource.

5.  Examples

   This section provides examples of both the Publish and Consumer
   interfaces.

   Note that due to RFC formatting conventions, this section often
   splits HTTP across lines whose content would exceed 72 characters.  A
   backslash character marks where this line folding has taken place.
   This backslash and its trailing CRLF and whitespace would not appear
   in the actual protocol contents.  Besides, also note that the
   indentation of the XML content is only provided for readability:
   actual messages will follow strict XML syntax, which allows for, but
   does not require, indentation.

5.1.  Publish Example

   Figure 4 shows the subscription/notification mechanism the Publish
   interface is based on, as defined in Section 4.1.  The csb subscribes
   for information at the Cloud (message A1.), and the Cloud accepts the
   subscription (A2).  Notifications are triggered by the Cloud (A3.)
   and acknowledged by the csb (A4.).

  B2. csb -> Cloud (200 to PUT)
  ------------------------------
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK



5.2.  Consumer Example

   The following example assumes the interested Requester already knows
   the HTTP URL where an csb is listening for Consumer messages.

   Figure 5 shows the HTTP-based transaction between the Requester and
   the csb.  The Requester sends a consumer request as payload of an
   HTTP POST message (1.), and the csb provides an answer in an HTTP 200
   OK message (2.).

8.  Security Considerations

   The csb network entity has two primary interfaces, Publish and
   Consumer, that carry sensitive information and must therefore be
   appropriately protected and secured.

   These two interfaces, uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as the
   mechanism for clients to connect to an csb to request cloud
   resources.  In the case of the HTTP use, any binding using the two
   interfaces MUST be capable of being transacted over TLS, as described
   in RFC 2818 [RFC2818].

   Finally, it is worthwhile to also discuss authorization issues
   related to the specification.  Neither the Publishing nor the
   Consumer interface provide an explicit means for implementing
   authentication, i.e., they do not envisage protocol messages to make
   sure, for instance, that only authorized requesters can make use of
   the services provided by a csb.  Nevertheless, considering both the
   interfaces are transported in well-established protocols (HTTP),
   support for such an functionality can be expressed by means of the
   authentication mechanisms provided by the protocol themselves.
   Therefore, any csb-aware entity (applications, clients, Cloud Service
   Providers, Media Resource Broker itself) MUST support the HTTP Digest
   access authentication.  That said, the usage of such Digest access
   authentications is recommended and not mandatory, which means csb-
   aware entities MAY exploit it in deployment.

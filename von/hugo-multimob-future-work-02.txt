 Evaluation of further issues on Multicast Mobility:  Potential future
                          work for WG MultiMob
              <draft-von-hugo-multimob-future-work-02.txt>

Abstract

   The WG MultiMob aims at defining a basic mobile multicast solution
   leveraging on network localized mobility management, i.e.  Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 protocol.  The solution would be basically based on
   multicast group management, i.e.  IGMP/MLD, proxying at the access
   gateway.  If such a basic solution is essential from an operational
   point of view, challenges with efficient resource utilization and
   user perceived service quality still persist.  These issues may
   prevent large scale deployments of mobile multicast applications.

   This document attempts to identify topics for near future extension
   of work such as modifying multimob base solution, PMIPv6 and MLD/
   IGMP for optimal multicast support, and adaptation of Handover
   optimization.  Far future items such as extending to and modifying
   of MIPv4/v6 and DSMIP, sender (source) mobility, consideration of
   multiple flows and multihoming will be dealt with in a future
   version.

Internet-Draft         Future Work for MultiMob WG         June 2010


1.  Introduction

   Chartered work of WG MultiMob focuses on documentation of proper
   configuration and usage of existing (specified standard) protocols
   within both mobility and multicast related areas to enable and
   support mobility for multicast services and vice versa.  The current
   WG document [I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution] does not address
   specific optimizations and efficiency improvements of multicast
   routing for network-based mobility and thus the operation may be not
   resource efficient nor grant the service quality expected by the end
   user.

   The described solution resolves the problem to ensure multicast
   reception in PMIPv6-enabled [RFC5213] networks without appropriate
   multicast support.  However it neither automatically minimizes
   multicast forwarding delay to provide seamless and fast handovers for
   real-time services nor minimizes packet loss and reordering that
   result from multicast handover management as stated in [RFC5757].
   Also Route Optimization is out of scope of the basic solution - an 
   issue for reducing amount of transport resource usage and
   transmission delay.  Thus possible enhancements and issues for
   solutions beyond a basic solution need to be described to enable
   current PMIPv6 protocols to fully support efficient mobile multicast
   services.  Such extensions may include protocol modifications for
   both mobility and multicast related protocols to achieve
   optimizations for resource efficient and performance increasing
   multimob approaches.  The document includes the case of mobile
   multicast senders using Any Source Multicast (ASM) and Source
   Specific Multicast (SSM) [RFC4607].

   This document focuses on discussion work on multicast protocols
   such as IGMP/MLD operational tuning (e.g. as proposed in 
   [I-D.asaeda-igmp-mld-optimization]) and enhancements of IGMP/MLD
   protocol behaviors and messages for optimal multicast support
   (proposed in [I-D.asaeda-igmp-mld-mobility-extension]).

   An alternative approach proposes the addition of acknowledgement
   messages on group management ([I-D.liu-multimob-reliable-igmp-mld])
   and changes the unreliable protocol concept.

   Furthermore a modification of PMIPv6 by introducing a dedicated
   multicast tunnel and support of local routing is discussed in
   [I-D.asaeda-multimob-pmip6-extension].  Other performance
   improvements have been outlined in 
   [I-D.schmidt-multimob-fmipv6-pfmipv6-multicast] where extensions to
    Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) [RFC5568], and the corresponding
   extension for Proxy MIPv6 operation [I-D.ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6].

Internet-Draft         Future Work for MultiMob WG         June 2010

   Another type of multimob work aims directly at enhancements of the
   current multimob base solution
   [I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution] towards introduction of
   multicast traffic replication mechanisms and a reduction of the
   protocol complexity in terms of time consuming tunnel set-up by
   definition of pre- or post-configured tunnels (as provided by e.g. 
   [I-D.zuniga-multimob-smspmip]).  Further work within this topic deals
    with direct routing (e.g. [I-D.sijeon-multimob-mms-pmip6]) and with
   dynamic or automatic tunnel configuration (see e.g.
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast]). 

   A large field of additional investigations which are partly described
   in detail in [RFC5757] will be mentioned for completeness and may be 
   subject of a later WG re-chartering.

   In summary additional to a 'Single hop, link, flow' Proxy MIP
   mobility for listening MNs (scenario shown in Figure 1), future work
   towards a complete performance-optimized scenario of a 'Multi-hop,
   -homed, -flow' client mobility (i.e. including MIPv6 [RFC3775] and 
   DSMIPv6 [RFC5555]) would cover a plurality of issues.  For the near

   future we see the following issues as most important:

   o  Extension of multimob base solution

   o  Modification of base PMIPv6 and MLD/IGMP for optimal multicast
      support.

   o  Consideration of Handover optimization.

   All further issues which would include extensions to and
   modifications of MIPv4/v6 and DSMIP using IGMP/MLD Proxy and the
   Foreign Agent/Access Router, consideration of sender (source)
   mobility, support of multiple flows on multihomed mobile nodes,
   multi-hop transmission, Routing optimization, and so forth will be
   topics for a potential next stage of future work extension.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3775], [RFC3376],
   [RFC3810], [RFC5213], [RFC5757].


3.  IGMP/MLD Proxy Architecture

   Multimob basic solution is based on IGMPv3/MLDv2 Proxy support at the
   mobile access gateway (MAG) of Proxy Mobile IPv6 as shown in
   Figure 1.  IGMPv3/MLDv2 proxy keeps multicast state on the
   subscriptions of the mobile nodes and only an aggregate state is kept
   at the local mobility anchor (LMA).  When LMA receives multicast data
   it can forward it to the MAG without duplication because MAG takes of
   the packet duplication.  This leads to solving the avalanche problem.

   By keeping multicast state locally, IGMPv3/MLDv2 Proxy introduces
   mobility related problems such as possible packet loss when a mobile
   node does a handover to another MAG and its multicast state is not
   modified fast enough at the LMA.

   IGMPv3/MLDv2 introduces tunnel convergence problem which occurs when
   a given MAG serves MNs that belong to different LMAs and MNs
   subscribe to the same multicast group.  In that case MNs receive
   duplicate multicast data forwarded from more than one LMA.

   It can be foreseen that mobile access gateways will serve both mobile
   and fixed terminals concurrently.  The tuning of multicast-related

Internet-Draft         Future Work for MultiMob WG         June 2010


   protocol parameters based on the terminal characteristics is needed.
   Parameters only applicable to mobile users need to be distinguished
   from the parameters applicable to fixed users.  It should be also
   possible to distinguish between slow and fast movement and handover
   frequency to form corresponding tunnels for mobile users.   

   Based on the above observations we will state the problems next and
   then list the requirements on possible solutions.


4.  Problem Description

   The general issues of multicast mobility are extensively discussed
   and described in [RFC5757].  To reduce the complexity of the
   plethora of requirements listed in [RFC5757] and also in
   [I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement] this document summarises some
   lightweight solutions for multicast mobility which allow for easy
   deployment within realistic scenarios and architectures.  Moreover
   we focus on approaches building directly on basic MultiMob solution
   [I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution] which is based on IGMP/MLD
   Proxy functionality at the mobile access gateway, and for which
   already solution proposals have been described.

4.1.  Modification of base PMIPv6 for optimal multicast support

   Currently discussed aspects of multicast optimization for PMIPv6
   include introduction of multicast tunnels and support of local
   routing such as described in [I-D.asaeda-multimob-pmip6-extension].  
   For a PMIPv6 domain the establishment of a dedicated multicast tunnel
   is proposed which may either be dynamically set up and released or be
   pre-configured in a static manner.  Both mobility entities MAG and    
   LMA may be operate as MLD proxy or multicast router. 
   Since further functional enhancements of PMIPv6 are currently under
   way in NETEXT WG, both the impact of new features on Mobile Multicast
   as well as such a Multicast-initiated proposal for PMIPv6
   modification have to be considered in a continuous exchange process
   between MultiMob and NETEXT WGs.

4.2.  Modification of MLD/IGMP for optimal multicast support

   Potential approaches for enhancement of group management as specified
   e.g. by MLDv2 [RFC3810] include operational improvements such as
   proper tuning in terms of default timer value modification, specific
   query message introduction, and standard (query) reaction
   suppression, beside introducing multicast router attendance control
   in terms of e.g. specification of a Listener Hold message as proposed
   in [I-D.asaeda-multimob-igmp-mld-mobility-extensions].

Internet-Draft         Future Work for MultiMob WG         June 2010


4.3.  Consideration of Handover Optimization

   Ideally the customer experience while using multicast services should
   not be affected by transmission issues whether the terminal is 
   operated in a fixed or a mobile environment.  This implies not only
   that the terminal should be unaware of changes at network layer
   connectivity (seamless communication) as is typically the case in a
   PMIPv6 domain, but also that any impact of connectivity changes
   (handover) should be minimized.  In the framework of Multimob this
   relates to reduction of delay, packet loss, and packet reordering
   effort for mobile multicast by applying fast handover mechanisms,
   which have originally been developed for unicast traffic to multicast
   group management.  [I-D.schmidt-multimob-fmipv6-pfmipv6-multicast]
   works on specification of extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers
   (FMIPv6) [RFC5568] and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6
   (PFMIPv6) [I-D.ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6] protocols to include multicast
   traffic management in fast handover operations.  Issues for further
   work are details of including multicast group messaging in context
   transfer, for both predictive and reactive handover mode, as well as
   details of corresponding message exchange protocols and message
   design.  



4.4.  Specific PMIP deployment issues

   Currently several proposals are under work which describe extensions
   of the base protocol WG draft
   [I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution].  While MAG operation will
   remain that of an MLD proxy additional LMA functionalities are  
   described in [I-D.zuniga-multimob-smspmip] which allow for
   replication of multicast traffic and solution of the tunnel
   convergence problem.  The dedicated multicast LMA may either set up
   dedicated multicast tunnels dynamically or a-priory via
   pre-configuration or a delayed release.


   Another solution on dynamic and/or automatic tunnel configuration is
   proposed within multicast WG MBONED [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast].


   A direct or local routing approach is described in
   [I-D.sijeon-multimob-mms-pmip6].  This scenario may hold for short
   term deployment focusing on an architecture where multicast traffic
   is provided via the home network.  However, depending on the network
   topology, namely the location of the content delivery network, the
   LMA may not be on the optimal multicast service delivery path.  This
   enables mobile nodes to access locally available multicast services
   such as local channels.

   Figure 3 illustrates the use-case for local routing.

                     Figure 3: local Multicast routing

   In such a case, the MAG should act as a multicast router to construct
   the optimal multicast delivery path.  If the MAG also supports MLD
   proxy function issue raises up on the dual mode behaviour.  In such a
   case, a pragmatic approach could be to leverage only on multicast
   routing at the MAG in the PMIP domain.

   Whatever is the MAG operation mode, the multicast state is locally
   kept at the access gateway, so unknown from the mobility anchor.  In
   other words, the multicast service is independent from the mobility
   service that the mobile node is receiving from the network in the
   form of PMIPv6 or DSMIPv6.  However, handover support is still
   desirable but cannot be provided by the mobility anchor (i.e.  HA or
   LMA).  In such a case mobility support for locally available
   multicast should be provided by extending multicast protocols of IGMP
   or MLD.


5.  Requirements on Solutions

   This section tries to identify requirements from the issues discussed
   in previous section.

   o  Seamless handover (low latency and during the handover).
   o  Similar packet loss to unicast service.
   o  Multiple LMAs architecture.
   o  Agnostic mobile host re-subscription.  So, MAGs must be able to
      retrieve multicast contexts of the mobile nodes.
   o  Solution address IPv6, IPv4 only and dual stack nodes.
   o  Supports sender (source) mobility.
   o  Optimal local routing.
   o  To be completed...


6.  Security Considerations

   This draft introduces no additional messages.  Compared to [RFC3376],
   [RFC3810], [RFC3775], and [RFC5213] there have no additional threats 
   been introduced.


7.  IANA Considerations

   Whereas this document does not explicitly introduce requests to IANA
   some of the proposals referenced above (such as
   [I-D.asaeda-multimob-pmip6-extension] and
   [I-D.schmidt-multimob-fmipv6-pfmipv6-multicast]) specify flags for
   mobility messages or options.  For details please see those
   documents.


8.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would thank all active members of MultiMob WG, especially
   (in no specific order) Gorry Fairhurst, Jouni Korhonen, Thomas
   Schmidt, Suresh Krishnan and Matthias Waehlisch for providing

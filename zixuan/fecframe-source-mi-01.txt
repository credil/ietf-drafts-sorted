Abstract 

Per FEC Framework, FEC source packet carries source FEC payload ID for 
FEC protection of arbitrary packet flow. Source FEC payload ID will 
contain information identifying the source block and the position within 
the source block. However, in order to maintain backwards compatibility, 
this document enables the receiver to get this information without 
appending source FEC payload ID. This information is obtained using the 
combination of information provided in the FEC payload header and source 
FEC payload mapping information unit (MIU). Therefore, both non-FEC-
capable and FEC-capable receivers can work together in a multicast 
session. Two ways to signal the source block structure are defined, one 
for general procedure and anther for systematic procedure that the order 
of the packets in the source block is deterministic.

Internet-Draft          source FEC payload MI             October 2009 
    

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies a new FEC payload header and a source FEC 
   payload mapping information unit (MIU) for the FEC backwards 
   compatibility. 

   FEC Framework [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] defines packet format for 
   FEC source packet and FEC repair packet. Per FEC framework, FEC 
   source packet carries generic explicit FEC payload ID for FEC 
   protection of arbitrary packet flow. A FEC-Framework-incompatible 
   client would fail to understand the source packet with FEC payload ID 
   included. FEC Framework describes a non-FEC Framework-compatible case 
   where FEC payload is not included in source packet, because FEC 
   payload ID can be derived from other information (e.g. sequence 
   number of some kind used by application protocol) from source packet.  

   However, in order to maintain backwards compatibility, the format 
   defined by this document enables the receiver to get this information 
   without appending source FEC payload ID. This information is obtained 
   using the combination of information provided in the FEC payload 
   header and source FEC payload mapping information unit (MIU). 
   Therefore, both non-FEC-capable and FEC-capable receivers can work 
   together in a multicast session. 

   The operation of the FEC mechanism requires that the receiver can get 
   information identifying the source block and the position within the 
   source block. The information is dependent on the source block 
   structure, there are different ways to signal the source block 
   structure. If the source block is deterministic, this case is 
   referred to as a ''systematic''. In this case the MIU can be 
   predigested and transmitted in the repair flow. 

   Otherwise, the source block is not deterministic. This case is 
   referred to as the ''general''. In this case, MIU is carried in 
   separate packet flow, the FEC payload header is used to enable 
   transmit MIU in separate flow and also to carry FEC repair flow. 
   Accordingly, this document defines two FEC schemes, one for the case 
   of a systematic structure of source block and anther for the case of 
   general structure of source block.

3. General procedures for structure of the source block 

  3.1. Introduction 

   This section specifies a general way to create the source block. 

   As described in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework], a source block is 
   generated by the FEC Framework from an ordered sequence of 
   Application Data Units. The allocation of Application Data Units to 
   blocks is dependent on application. 

   This scheme is the same as that specified in [3GPP MBMS 
   Specification]. 

   This scheme specifies a FEC payload header and a source FEC payload 
   mapping information unit (MIU) in separate packet flow. 

  3.2. Source block creation and example 

   The following steps are provided. 

    1. For the packet placed into the source block create a byte array 
       as follows: 

       a)              The value of the packet flow identifier, followed by the value 
          of the packet size, are first written as single byte and two-
          byte value in network byte order respectively into the first 
          available bytes in the source block 

       b)              Append the entire packet including its application header 

       c)              If the next available byte is not the first byte of a new 
          symbol, then padding bytes up to the next symbol boundary  

    2. Append any packets one after the other in the following way: 

       a)              The procedure is repeated starting each packet flow identifier 
          at the start of the next symbol 

       b)              The allocation of Packets to source block is dependent on 
          application  

   An example of forming a source block is given in figure blow. In this 
   example, three packets of size 26, 42 and 10, which taken from flow 0 
   and flow 1, have been placed into a source block.

4. Systematic procedures for structure of the source block 

  4.1. Introduction 

   This section specifies a systematic way to create the source block. 
   There is a modified version in section 3, which the order of packets 
   in the source block is deterministic.

  4.2. Source block creation and example 

   The following steps are provided. 

    1. For the packet placed into the source block create a byte array 
       as follows: 

       a)              The value of the packet flow identifier, followed by the value 
          of the packet size, are first written as single byte and two-
          byte value in network byte order respectively into the first 
          available bytes in the source block 

       b)              Append the entire packet including its application header 

       c)              If the next available byte is not the first byte of a new 
          symbol, then padding bytes up to the next symbol boundary  

       d)              Add padding so that the byte array is in the size of the 
          largest packet protected by this source block  

    2. Append any packets one after the other in the following way: 

       a)              The procedure is repeated starting each packet flow identifier 
          at the start of the next symbol 

       b)              Packets from the same flow are consecutive in the source block 

       c)              The packets of the same flow are in an increasing order of the 
          sequence number 

       d)              The sequence number of packets belonging to the same flow must 
          be consecutive in a single source block 

       e)              The packets of the different flow are in an increasing order of 
          the flow number  

   An example of forming a source block is given in figure  blow. In 
   this example, three packets of size 26, 42 and 10, which taken from 
   flow 0 and flow 1, have been placed into a source block.

5. Session Description Protocol (SDP) signaling 

   According to the FEC framework, the scheme must define an format for 
   MIU. This section provides the media subtype registration for the FEC 
   Mapping Information. 

   The FEC Mapping Information is indicated in SDP using a media block 
   with the protocol identifier ''UDP/FEC-MI''. The media type shall be 
   ''application''.

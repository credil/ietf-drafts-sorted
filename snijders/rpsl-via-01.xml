    <abstract>
      <t>

This document defines two attributes in the aut-num Class which can be used
in RPSL policy specifications to publish desired routing policy regarding
non-adjacent networks. 

      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>

The Routing Policy Specification Language <xref target="RFC4012" /> allows
operators to specify routing policies regarding directly adjacent networks
through various import and export attributes.  These attributes only apply
to directly adjacent networks.

      </t>
      <t>

This document proposes to extend RPSL according to the following
goals and requirements:

        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>

Provide a way to describe what an adjacent network could use as routing policy
towards its adjacent networks.

          </t>
          <t>

The extension should be backward compatible with minimal impact on existing
tools and processes, following Section 10.2 of <xref target="RFC2622" />.

          </t>
        </list>

The addition of the 'via-import' and 'via-export' attributes in the aut-num
Class will especially help participants of Multi-Lateral Peering services to
inform the intermediate autonomous system what routing policy should be
applied towards other participants. 

      </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target="RFC2119" />.
      </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Background">
      <t>

The via keyword specifically benefits operators whom were assigned
a 32 bit AS Number and transit providers when participating in
Multi-Lateral Peering Agreements facilitated by a Route Server. 

      </t>
      <t>

Often Route Server operators overload BGP Communities <xref target="RFC1997"
/>) to facilitate signalling of desired routing policy between the participants
and the Route Server. Because BGP Communities have a length of 32 bit,
it is not possible to signal a 32 bit AS Number coupled with an action.
In practise this means Route Server participants whom use a 32 bit AS
Number cannot specifically be included or excluded during path
distribution calculations on the Route Server unless a mapping system
is applied. 

      </t>
      <t>

Transit providers often uphold a routing policy which intents that
the transit provider does not want to exchange paths with its downstream
customers through Route Servers. The via keyword allows transit providers
to participate in Multi-Lateral Peering services while instructing Route
Server operators through a simple routing policy specification that paths 
should not be distributed to downstream customers and reducing the 
likelyhood of Path Hiding on the Route Server.

      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Import and Export Via Syntax and Semantics">
      <t>

The two attributes can be used within the aut-num class.

    <list style="empty">
        <t>import-via:</t>
        <t>export-via:</t>
    </list>

        <figure anchor="vis_syntax">
          <preamble>The syntax for these attributes is as follows:</preamble>
          <artwork>
Attribute  Value                                         Type
import-via [protocol &lt;protocol-1&gt;] [into &lt;protocol-2&gt;]   optional,
           [afi &lt;afi-list&gt;]                              multi-valued
           &lt;mp-peering-1&gt;
           from &lt;mp-peering-2&gt; [action &lt;action-1&gt;; ... &lt;action-N&gt;;]
           . . .
           &klt;mp-peering-3&gt;
           from &lt;mp-peering-M&gt; [action &lt;action-1&gt;; ... &lt;action-N&gt;;]
           accept &lt;mp-filter&gt; [;]

export-via [protocol &lt;protocol-1&gt;] [into &lt;protocol-2&gt;]   optional,
           [afi &lt;afi-list&gt;]                              multi-valued
           &lt;mp-peering-1&gt;
           to &lt;mp-peering-2&gt; [action &lt;action-1&gt;; ... &lt;action-N&gt;;]
           . . .
           &lt;mp-peering-3&gt;
           to &lt;mp-peering-M&gt; [action &lt;action-1&gt;; ... &lt;action-N&gt;;]
           announce &lt;mp-filter&gt; [;]

          </artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>
      <t>

The import-via and export-via attributes are optional, and should be ignored by
implementations which do not support interpretation of those attributes. The
syntax closely mimicks the mp-import and mp-export attributes described in 
Section 2.5 of <xref target="RFC4012" />, with the exception that before the
"from" and "to" keywords an &klt;mp-peering&gt; is defined to indicate the
common AS between two non-adjacent networks.

      </t>
      <t>

In the above example &lt;peering-1&gt; and &lt;peering-3&gt; are directly adjacent
networks, for instance a Multi-Lateral Peering service. &lt;peering-2&gt; is a
non-adjacent network.

          <preamble>Putting it all together:</preamble>
          <artwork>
   aut-num: AS5580
   import-via: AS6777
                from AS15562

                announce AS-ATRATO
   import-via: AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
                from AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS
                accept NOT ANY
   export-via: AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
                to AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS announce NOT ANY
   import-via: AS6777
                from AS4247483647
                accept AS4247483647
   export-via: AS6777
                to AS4247483647 action community.={5580:40};
                announce AS-ATRATO
          </artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>
      <t>
 
In the above examples AS5580 and AS15562 are Route Server participants.
AS4247483647 is a participant whom has been assigned a 32 bit AS Number.
AS6777 functions as a Route Server <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server" />
and AS-SET AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS contains a list of Route Server AS Numbers.
AS-SET AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS contains a list of downstream transit customers from AS5580. 
    </t>
    <t>
The intention of the above policy would be to enable the exchange of NLRI's
through AS6777 with two parties: AS15562 and AS4247483647, yet prevent the
Route Server from distributing NLRI's announced by AS5580 towards customers of
said network. Publishing the policy that AS5580 will not accept customer
routes through the Route Server can help counteract the "path hiding" phenomenon
as described in Section 2.3.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server" />,
as the Route Server now is informed which NLRI's should not be considered in
the best path selection process.

      <t>

The authors would like to thank Remko van Mook for confirming that 'via'
is a better keyword than 'through' or 'thru', Nick Hilliard for his 
unparalleled support and Jeffrey Haas for providing historic perspective.

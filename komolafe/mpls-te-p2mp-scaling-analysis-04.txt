Abstract

   Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) is
   deployed in providers' core networks, and the scaling properties
   have been analyzed to show how much control state must be maintained
   to support a full mesh of edge-to-edge point-to-point (P2P) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) in various network topologies and with several
   different scaling techniques.

   Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS-TE LSPs are very interesting to
   service providers as a means to provide multicast services (such as
   TV distribution, or multicast VPN connectivity) across core MPLS
   networks. P2MP LSPs have different scaling properties than P2P LSPs,
   and service providers need to understand whether existing protocols
   and implementations can support the network sizes and service levels
   that they are planning in their P2MP MPLS-TE networks.

   This document presents an analysis of the scaling properties MPLS-TE
   core networks that support P2MP LSPs.

1. Introduction

   Network operators and service providers are examining scaling issues
   as they look to deploy ever-larger traffic engineered Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS-TE) networks. Concerns have been raised about
   the number of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that need to be supported
   at the edge and at the core of the network. The impact on control
   plane and management plane resources threatens to outweigh the
   benefits and popularity of MPLS-TE, while the physical limitations of
   the routers may constrain the deployment options. These issues and
   concerns are examined in [RFC5439] for networks carrying point-to-
   point (P2P) LSPs.

   Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS-TE LSPs are very interesting to
   service providers as a means to provide multicast services (such as
   TV distribution, or multicast VPN connectivity) across core MPLS
   networks. The MPLS-TE and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signaling
   ([RFC3209] and [RFC3473]) has been extended to support the control
   plane establishment of P2MP LSPs [RFC4875]. P2MP LSPs have different
   scaling properties than P2P LSPs, and service providers need to
   understand whether existing protocols and implementations can support
   the network sizes and service levels that they are planning in their
   P2MP MPLS-TE networks.

   This document presents an analysis of the scaling properties MPLS-TE
   core networks that support P2MP LSPs.

1.1 Overview

   Point-to-multipoint LSPs can be considered as a set of point-to-point
   fragments that are joined together to form a tree. The tree is rooted
   at the source, and has a number of leaves (destinations). Each P2P
   fragment runs between the source and a branch, between a pair of
   branches, or between a branch and a leaf (in the extreme case, a
   fragment may also run directly between the root and a branch).

   The scaling benefit of a P2MP LSP comes in the fact that only one
   copy of the data for a set of leaves downstream of a particular
   branch is transmitted to that branch. This means that only one set of
   resources (for example, buffers) is consumed on the path upstream of
   the branch, leaving room for other LSPs to traverse the same path.

   In the control plane there are savings, too. At each branch node, it
   is necessary to hold only one piece of upstream control plane state,
   and one piece of state for each downstream fragment. This compares
   with the P2P equivalent where it would be necessary to hold as much
   upstream state as downstream state.



Komolafe, Farrel, and King                                      [Page 3]

draft-komolafe-mpls-te-p2mp-scaling-analysis-04.txt          August 2010


   Note that this is a slight simplification. P2MP control plane state
   must identify all downstream leaves and may contain certain leaf-
   specific information such as the paths to those leaves), and this
   information must be present in the upstream control plane state.
   Nevertheless, the reduction in quantity of state information is
   significant, and the effort required within the protocol
   implementation to maintain the state information is reduced exactly
   as described.

   Thus, in order to quantify the scaling properties of P2MP LSPs in a
   network, we count control plane state per interface. That is, at any
   given node on the path of a P2MP tree we count the number of the
   node's interfaces that participate in the LSP. At the source, this is
   always one. At a branch node it is (1 + n) where there is just one
   upstream interface and n downstream interfaces. At a leaf we consider
   just one upstream interface. (Note that the special case of a bud
   node [RFC4875] that is a leaf but that also has downstream neighbors
   in the LSP is not considered in this document. This is a feature of
   the snowflake topology that is used as the model as described in
   Section 1.3.)

   The approach adopted in this document is to derive some formulae
   based on the probabilistic measure of where a node lies in the
   network, and what role it plays in the P2MP LSP. Furthermore, in
   order to simplify the equations that are derived, certain
   approximations are introduced - although these are believed to
   diminish in significance as the size of the network grows. This
   method is verified by applying it to P2P LSPs and comparing the
   results with those algorithms derived in [RFC5439]. As described
   in Section 8, although this mechanism seems to deliver reasonable
   results and agrees with the P2P formulae of [RFC5439], the
   mathematical model needs further validation. Similarly, it would be
   valuable to attempt to quantify the approximations in the model.

   This document is designed to help service providers discover whether
   existing protocols and implementations can support the network sizes
   that they are planning. To do this, it presents an analysis of some
   of the scaling concerns for MPLS-TE core networks, and examines the
   value of two techniques for improving scaling. This should motivate
   the development of appropriate deployment techniques and protocol
   extensions to enable the application of MPLS-TE in large networks.

   This version of this document is limited to the analysis of P2MP LSPs
   in the artificially symmetric snowflake network, and the comparison
   of the results with those for P2P LSPs. The document does not address
   any scaling techniques such as hierarchical LSPs [RFC4206] (whether
   P2P or P2MP), nor does it look at protection mechanisms such as Fast
   Re-route (FRR) [RFC4090]. These features and their applicability to
   other generic network topologies are for future study.

1.2 Definitions and Glossary of Notation

   This document applies consistent notation to define various
   parameters of the networks that are analyzed. These terms are defined
   as they are introduced though-out the document, but are grouped
   together here for quick reference. Refer to the full definitions in
   the text for detailed explanations.

   Where possible, these terms are kept consistent with those used in
   [RFC5439].

   n     A network level. n = 1 is the core of the network.
   P(n)  A node at level n in the network.
   S(n)  The number of nodes at level n, i.e., the number of P(n) nodes.
   L(n)  The number of LSPs traversing a P(n) node.
   X(n)  The number of LSP segment states maintained by a P(n) node,
         i.e., X(n) = 2*L(n) for P2P LSPs.
   x(n)  A single LSP segment state maintained by a P(n) node; i.e.,
         X(n) = SUM[x(n)]
   M(n)  The number of P(n+1) nodes subtended to a P(n) node.
   N     The number of destination PEs for each P2MP LSP; i.e. the size
         of the receiving set is N.

   Sibling nodes: PEs subtended to the same P(n).

   First cousin nodes: PEs subtended to the same P(n-1) but different
                       P(n).

   Second cousin nodes: PEs attached to different P(n-1) nodes.

   C(init): The cost in terms of x(n) of setting up a P2MP LSP from a
            source to the closest PE in the receiving set.

   C(inc):  The incremental cost in terms of x(n) of having a subsequent
            PE in the receiving set.

1.3. Network Topologies

   At this stage, analysis is limited to the snowflake topology defined
   in [RFC5439]. In this type of network, only the very core of the
   network is meshed. The edges of the network are formed as trees
   rooted in the core.

   Thus, the snowflake topology is based on a hierarchy of connectivity
   within the core network. PEs are not directly interconnected, but
   have connectivity to exactly one P(n) (dual homing is not considered
   at this stage). Each P(n) is connected to precisely one P(n-1) and to
   no other P(n) node. There is one exception: the P(1) nodes are

   assumed to be connected in a full mesh. Figure 1 shows an example
   snowflake topology.

            Figure 1 : A Snowflake Network

   In Figure 1, the PEs marked PEa and PEb are siblings (subtended to
   the same P(n) - n=2 in this network). The PEs marked PEa and PEc are
   first cousins (subtended to the same P(n-1) but to different P(n)s).
   The PEs marked PEa and PEd are second cousins (subtended to different
   P(n-1) nodes).

   Throughout this document, a snowflake network with 3 levels (i.e.,
   there are P(1), P(2) and PE Label Switching Routers (LSRs)) is
   considered. However, the methodology employed may be easily applied
   to networks with a greater number of levels.

1.4. Relationship Probabilities

   In a snowflake network with 3 levels, consider a given PE: there are
   a total of S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1 other PEs, of which M(2) - 1 are
   siblings. Hence, the probability of another PE chosen at random being
   a sibling is:

      Prob(sibling) = (M(2) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)


Komolafe, Farrel, and King                                      [Page 6]

draft-komolafe-mpls-te-p2mp-scaling-analysis-04.txt          August 2010


   Similarly:

      Prob(first cousin) = (M(2)*(M(1) - 1)) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

   And:

      Prob(second cousin) = M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

2. Issues of Concern for Scaling

   Issues of concern for scaling are discussed in detail in [RFC5439]
   and translate to P2MP LSPs. The issues directly affect the number of
   LSPs that an LSR can support, and therefore may limit the number of
   LSPs and hence customer services that can be supported by a network.

   The issues may be summarized as follows.

   - LSP State

     LSP state is the data (information) that must be stored at an LSR
     in order to maintain an LSP. This is mainly information used by the
     control plane protocols and grows in direct proportion to the
     number of LSPs. Since the memory capacity of an LSR is limited,
     there is a related limit placed on the number LSPs that can be
     supported.

   - Processing Overhead

     The number of LSPs passing through an LSR may impact the processing
     speed for each LSP. For example, control block search times can
     increase with the number of control blocks to be searched. Thus,
     since CPU power is constrained in any LSR, there may be a practical
     limit to the number of LSPs that can be supported.

   - RSVP-TE Implications

     RSVP-TE is a soft-state protocol which means that protocol messages
     (refresh messages) must be regularly exchanged between signaling
     neighbors in order to maintain the state for each LSP that runs
     between the neighbors. Observations of existing implementations
     indicate that there may be a threshold of around 50,000 P2P LSPs
     above which an LSR struggles to achieve sufficient processing to
     maintain LSP state. No observational figures are available for P2MP
     LSPs, but similar behavior may be expected. Various techniques
     including refresh reduction [RFC2961], increasing the refresh
     interval, use of the RSVP-TE Hello message [RFC3209], and the use
     of GMPLS extensions [RFC3473] (such as the use of [RFC2961] message
     acknowledgements on all messages) can improve the situation
     markedly.

Komolafe, Farrel, and King                                      [Page 7]

draft-komolafe-mpls-te-p2mp-scaling-analysis-04.txt          August 2010


   - Management

     Another practical concern for the scalability of large MPLS-TE
     networks is the ability to manage the network. This may be
     constrained by the available tools, the practicality of managing
     large numbers of LSPs, and the management protocols in use.

   All of these consideration limit the number of LSPs supported within
   the network and at any particular LSR.

3. A New Method for Calculations for Point-to-Point LSPs

3.1. Number of LSPs Traversing a P(1) Node

   To calculate the number of LSPs seen by each P(1) LSR, consider the
   case when each PE establishes a single P2P LSP to a destination PE
   chosen at random. Zero, one, or two P(1) LSRs will be traversed
   depending on whether the destination is a sibling, first cousin, or
   second cousin respectively. Hence it may be said that each P(1) LSR
   traversed will either be:

   - an ingress P(1) LSR: such a node is the only P(1) LSR traversed if
     the destination is a first cousin and the first P(1) LSR traversed
     if the destination is a second cousin. Hence, each P1 LSR will be
     an ingress P(1) LSR for each of the M(1)*M(2) subtended PEs that
     establishes an LSP destined for a PE that is not a sibling, the
     probability of which is 1 - Prob(sibling).

   or

   - an egress P(1) LSR: such a node is the second P(1) LSR traversed as
     a result of the destination being a second cousin. Essentially, an
     egress P(1) LSR handles the LSPs destined for subtended PEs
     originating from second cousin PEs. There is a total of
     M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1) source PEs which are second cousin nodes to
     the subtended PEs and the possibility of each of these establishing
     an LSP to one of the subtended PEs is
     Prob(second cousin) / (S(1) - 1).

   Figure 2 illustrates examples of ingress P(1) and egress P(1) nodes.
   The figure shows three exemplar LSPs from a common source to three
   distinct destinations (d, d1, and d2). d is a sibling of the source,
   d1 is a first cousin of the source, and d2 is a second cousin of the
   source. In these LSPs there is one ingress P(1) (marked as iP(1)) and
   one egress P(1) (marked as eP(1)).

   Each P(1) LSR will be both an ingress and egress LSR depending on the
   relative location of the source and destination PEs. Therefore, l(1),
   the number of LSPs seen by a P(1) LSR if every PE were to establish
   an LSP to a randomly selected PE is:

   l(1) = M(1)*M(2)*(1 - Prob(sibling)) +
          M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1) * Prob(second cousin)/(S(1) - 1)
        = M(1)*M(2)*(1 - Prob(sibling)) +
          M(1)*M(2) * Prob(second cousin)
        = M(1)*M(2) * (1 - ( (M(2) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1) +
          M(1)*M(2) * (M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1))
        = M(1)*M(2) *
            (2*S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - M(2) - M(1)*M(2)) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)
        = M(1)*M(2) * (2*S(PE) - M(2) - M(1)*M(2)) / (S(PE) - 1)

draft-komolafe-mpls-te-p2mp-scaling-analysis-04.txt          August 2010


   Lastly, l(1) is obtained when each PE establishes a single LSP to a
   randomly chosen destination. L(1) refers to when LSPs are established
   to S(PE) - 1 destinations and so:

     L(1) = M(1)*M(2)*(2*S(PE) - M(2) - M(1)*M(2))

   This result is consistent with the result shown in section 5.1 of
   [RFC5439].

3.2. Number of LSPs Traversing a P(2) Node

   Again, assuming each source PE establishes a single P2P LSP to a
   randomly chosen destination PE, the manner in which the P(2) LSRs
   will be traversed by LSPs is described below, illustrated in
   Figure 3, and summarized in Table 2.

   - An ingress P2 LSR is traversed when one of the subtended PEs
     establishes an LSP. There are M2 subtended PEs and the probability
     of each PE establishing an LSP that traverses the given P(2) node
     is 1.

   - A first cousin egress P(2) LSR handles the LSP whenever it is
     established by one of the first cousin PEs and destined for one of
     the subtended PEs. There are M(2)*(M(1) - 1) first cousins and the
     probability of each of these establishing an LSP to a PE subtended
     to any given P(2) node is Prob(first cousin) / (M(1) - 1).

   - A second cousin egress P(2) LSR handles the LSP whenever it is
     established by one of the second cousin PEs and destined for one of
     the subtended PEs. The number of the former is M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1)
     and the probability of the latter is
     Prob(second cousin) / M(1)*(S(1) - 1).

   Figure 3 shows examples of ingress and egress P(2) nodes. There are
   three exemplar LSPs from a single source to three destinations (d,
   d1, and d2). d is a sibling of the source, d1 is a first cousin
   of the source, and d2 is a second cousin of the source. The ingress
   P(2) node is marked iP(2). There are two egress P(2) nodes; one is a
   first cousin egress P(2) (marked e1P(2) on the figure), and one is a
   second cousin egress P(2) (marked e2P(2)).

   Therefore, l(2), the number of LSPs seen by a P(2) LSR if every PE
   were to establish an LSP to a randomly selected PE is:

   l(2) = M(2) + M(2)(M(1) - 1)*(Prob(first cousin) / (M(1) - 1) ) +
          M(1)*M(2)(S(1) - 1)*(Prob(second cousin)/(M(1)*(S(1) - 1)) )
        = M(2) + M(2)*Prob(first cousin) + M(2)*Prob(second cousin)
        = ( M(2) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1) ) *
            ( S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1 + M(1)*M(2) - M(2) +
                            S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - M(1)*M(2) )
        = (M(2) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)) * (2*S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - M(2) - 1)
        = M(2) * (2*S(PE) - M(2) - 1) / (S(PE) - 1)


Komolafe, Farrel, and King                                     [Page 11]

draft-komolafe-mpls-te-p2mp-scaling-analysis-04.txt          August 2010


   Therefore:

     L(2) = M(2) * (2*S(PE) - M(2) - 1)

   This result is also consistent with the conclusion reached in section
   5.1 of [RFC5439]. We can, therefore, assume that this approach is
   viable P2P MPLS-TE LSPs. The next sections extend this approach to
   P2MP LSPs.

4. Analysis of a P2MP LSP with Two Destinations

   Consider a P2MP LSP with a set of receiving nodes (destinations)
   called d1 and d2. If we count the number of hops from the source to
   each destination, we are able to designate d1 as the closer to the
   source, and d2 as being equidistant or further from the source.

   According to our definitions, d1 must be a sibling, a first cousin,
   or a second cousin of the source. We consider these three
   possibilities in turn.

4.1. Closest Destination is a Sibling of the Source

   The probability that d1 is a sibling of the source is

   Prob(sibling) = (M(2) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

   The cost associated with this possibility is that each P(2) LSR holds
   two state segments (one corresponding to the input interface and one
   for the output interface), giving C(init) = 2*x(2).

   The incremental cost of reaching d2, C(inc), is dependent on its
   relative location to d1. As shown in Figure 4, there are three
   distinct possibilities:

   - d2 is a sibling of d1 (and so also a sibling of the source)

     Excluding the source and d1, there is a total of
     S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2 PEs of which M(2) - 2 are siblings of d1 and the
     source. Thus, for d2 the probability of being a sibling is:

     Prob(sibling) = (M(2) - 2) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2)

     Replication must occur at the P(2) LSR for the P2MP LSP to reach d2
     and so the incremental cost is an extra state segment at the P(2)
     LSR, thus C(inc) = x(2).





Komolafe, Farrel, and King                                     [Page 12]

draft-komolafe-mpls-te-p2mp-scaling-analysis-04.txt          August 2010


   - d2 is a first cousin of d1 (and the source)

     The probability that d2 is a first cousin of the source is

     Prob(first cousin) = (M(2)*(M(1) - 1)) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2)

     Replication occurs at the first P(2) LSR, giving an extra state
     segment there, x(2). Since d2 is a first cousin, only a single P(1)
     is traversed, requiring that LSR to support two state segments,
     yielding 2*x(1). Lastly, the P(2) LSR to which d2 is attached must
     be traversed by the LSP, leading to that LSR supporting two state
     segments, giving 2*x(1). Aggregating, we arrive at:

     C(inc) = x(2) + 2*x(1) + 2*x(2)

   - d2 is a second cousin of d1 (and the source)

     The probability that d2 is a second cousin of the source is

     Prob(second cousin) = (M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1)) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2)

     The only difference with the previous scenario is that d2 being a
     second cousin requires the LSP to traverse an extra P(1) LSR,
     giving C(inc) = x(2) +2*x(1) +2*x(1) + 2*x(2)

   In Figure 4 we show a source and the nearest destination, d1. d1 is a
   sibling of the source. Three possible locations for d2 are
   considered: d2a is a sibling of d1 (and of the source), d2b is a
   first cousin of d1 (and of the source), d2c is a second cousin of d1
   (and of the source).

4.2. Closest Destination is a First Cousin of the Source

   The probability that d1 is a first cousin of the source is:

   Prob(first cousin) = M(2)*(M(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

   The associated initial cost is:

   C(init) = 2*x(2) + 2*x(1) + 2*x(2).

   Given the requirement that d1 is equidistant or closer to the source
   than d2, d2 cannot be a sibling of the source. This leaves the
   following possibilities, also illustrated in Figure 5:

   - d2 is a sibling of d1 (and a first cousin of the source)

     Prob(sibling) = (M(2) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2)

     C(inc) = x(2)

   - d2 is a first cousin of d1 (and of the source)

     Prob(first cousin) = M(2)*(M(1) - 2) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2)

     C(inc) = x(1) + 2*x(2)

   - d2 is a second cousin of d1 (and of the source)

     Prob(second cousin) = M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2)

     C(inc) = x(1) + 2*x(1) + 2*x(2)

   In Figure 5 we show a source and the nearest destination, d1. d1 is a
   first cousin of the source. Three possible locations for d2 are
   considered: d2a is a sibling of d1, d2b is a first cousin of d1, d2c
   is a second cousin of d1.

4.3. Closest Destination is a Second Cousin of the Source

   The probability that d1 is a second cousin of the source is:

   Prob(second cousin) = M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

   The associated initial cost is:

   C(init) = 2*x(2) + 2*x(1) + 2*x(1) + 2*x(2)

   Given the requirement that d1 is equidistant or closer to the source
   than d2, d2 cannot be a sibling or a first cousin of the source. This
   leaves the following possibilities, also illustrated in Figure 6:

   - d2 is a sibling of d1 (and a second cousin of the source)

     Prob(sibling) = (M(2) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2)

     C(inc) = x(2)

   - d2 is a first cousin of d1 (and a second cousin of the source)

     Prob(first cousin) = M(2)*(M(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2)

     C(inc) = x(1) + 2*x(2)

   - d2 is a second cousin of d1 (and of the source)

     Prob(second cousin) = M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 2) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 2)

4.4. The Average Number of State Segments at P(1) and P(2) LSRs

   Having discussed the nine different permutations of establishing a
   P2MP LSP from a given PE to two destination PEs in a three-level
   snowflake topology, the next step is to explore the scalability of
   this configuration by computing the number of LSP state segments that
   must be handled by the P(1) and P(2) LSRs. To compute this value, the
   cost associated with each permutation, obtained by summing C(inc) and
   C(init) appropriately, has to be weighted by the corresponding
   probability and the overall cost aggregated. Table 3 gives the nine
   permutations, the associated costs in terms of state segments that
   must be managed at P(1) and P(2) nodes and the exact and approximate
   probabilities of the particular LSP being established.

   In Table 3, the following three probabilities must be recalled:

   Prob(sibling) = (M(2) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

   Prob(first cousin) = M(2)*(M(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

   Prob(second cousin) = M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

   For the sake of fitting the table on the page, the equations for the
   exact probabilities for d2 positions are numbered I through VI and
   are listed after the table.

                     Establishing P2MP LSP To Two PEs

   The approximate probabilities essentially assume the probabilities of
   d2 being in a certain location are independent of the location of d1,
   which is evidently not the case. However, such an approximation is
   attractive as it simplifies the equations significantly (a fact more
   important as the size of the receiving set grows). Furthermore,
   comparing the approximate and exact probabilities suggest that the
   approximate probabilities are not unreasonable, and actually would be
   expected to be close the exact probabilities for large networks
   (i.e., large values of M(1), M(2), and S(1) should reduce the
   discrepancy).

   Therefore, approximate probabilities are used in the remainder of
   this document. In consequence, the total approximate number of state
   segments at P(1) and P(2) LSRs, X(1) and X(2) respectively, may be
   calculated as follows:

   X1 = 2*Prob(sibling)*Prob(first cousin) +
        4*Prob(sibling)*Prob(second cousin) +
        2*Prob(first cousin)*Prob(sibling) +
        3*Prob(first cousin)**2 +
        5*Prob(first cousin)*Prob(second cousin) +
        4*Prob(second cousin)*Prob(sibling) +
        5*Prob(second cousin)*Prob(first cousin) +
        7*Prob(second cousin)**2

      = 4*Prob(sibling)*Prob(first cousin) +
        8*Prob(sibling)*Prob(second cousin) +
        3*Prob(first cousin)**2 +
        10*Prob(first cousin)*Prob(second cousin) +
        7*Prob(second cousin)**2

   X2 = 3*Prob(sibling)**2 +
        5*Prob(sibling)*Prob(first cousin) +
        5*Prob(sibling)*Prob(second cousin) +
        5*Prob(first cousin)*Prob(sibling) +
        6*Prob(first cousin)**2 +
        6*Prob(first cousin)*P(second cousin) +
        5*Prob(second cousin)*Prob(sibling) +
        6*Prob(second cousin)*P(first cousin) +
        6*Prob(second cousin)**2

     =  3*Prob(sibling)**2 +
        10*Prob(sibling)*Prob(first cousin) +
        10*Prob(sibling)*Prob(second cousin) +
        6*Prob(first cousin)**2 +
        12*Prob(first cousin)*Prob(second cousin) +
        6*Prob(second cousin)**2

   These two equations give the number of state segments that must be
   handled by the P(1) and P(2) LSRs respectively if a source sets up a
   P2MP LSP to any 2 PEs. The values for Prob(sibling),
   Prob(first cousin), and Prob(second cousin) from Section 1.4 may be
   substituted into the equations allowing X(1) and X(2) to be expressed
   in terms of the topological properties of the network. Furthermore,
   the two equations for X(1) and X(2) correspond to the establishment
   of a single P2MP LSP, and so the equations must be appropriately
   scaled to handle more than one P2MP LSP. For example, the results
   should be multiplied by S(PE) to reflect every PE establishing an
   LSP.

draft-komolafe-mpls-te-p2mp-scaling-analysis-04.txt          August 2010


   Lastly, the equations for X(1) and X(2) give the total number of
   state segments handled by all P(1) and P(2) LSRs in the network and
   so must be divided by the number of each type of LSR to obtain the
   average values. Intuitively, the symmetry in the snowflake network
   suggests that there will be little variance around the average value
   provided each PE establishes an equal number of LSPs and the
   destinations are chosen from an identical statistical distribution.

4.5. Generic Formula for Number of State Segments at P(1) and P(2) LSRs

   Let D be the set of possible locations for a given destination in a
   P2MP LSP and so:

     D = {sibling, first cousin, second cousin}

   Let D1 and D2 be members of D. Using the patterns which may be
   observed in Table 3, generic formulae for X(1) and X(2) may be
   computed.

   X1 = SUM [ SUM [Prob(d1 = D1)*Prob(d2 = D2)*(fa(D1) + fb(D1, D2))] ]
         D1    D2

   where

     fa(D1) = 0 if D1 is sibling
              2 if D1 is first cousin
              4 if D1 is second cousin

     fb(D1, D2) = 0 if D2 is sibling
                  1 if D1 is not sibling AND D2 is first cousin
                  2 if D1 is sibling AND D2 is first cousin
                  3 if D1 is not sibling AND D2 is second cousin
                  4 if D1 is sibling AND D2 is second cousin

   This equation for X(1) basically says that to compute the number of
   state segments at the P(1) LSR, iterate over all possible relative
   locations for the PEs in the receiving set and, for each permutation,
   calculate the product of the probability of that permutation
   occurring (i.e., Prob(d1 = D1)*P(d2 = D2)) and the associated cost
   (i.e., (fa(D1)+fb(D1, D2)). Summing the products over all the
   permutations give the desired metric.

   fa(D1) describes the number of state segments that must be handled by
   P(1) LSRs due to the location of the first PE in the receiving set,
   d1. No state segments are handled by any P(1) LSR if d1 is a sibling
   of the source. In this case, the LSP does not need to traverse any
   P(1) LSR to reach d1, but rather reaches it via the P(2) LSR to which
   d1 and the source are both attached. If d1 is a first cousin of the


Komolafe, Farrel, and King                                     [Page 19]

draft-komolafe-mpls-te-p2mp-scaling-analysis-04.txt          August 2010


   source, the LSP reaches it via the P(1) LSRs to which they are both
   subtended and so two state segments must be handled by the P(1) LSR.
   Four state segments are handled by P(1) LSRs when d1 is a second
   cousin of the source due to the requirement for the LSP to traverse
   two P(1) LSRs.

   fb(D1, D2) describes the incremental cost associated with any
   replication necessary for the P2MP LSP to reach the second PE in the
   receiving set, d2. If d2 is a sibling of d1, then no state segments
   need be handled by any of the P(1) LSRs. On the other hand, if d2 is
   a first cousin of d1, then one or two additional state segments must
   be handled by the P(1) LSRs, depending on whether or not d1 is a
   sibling of the source. If d1 is a sibling, then replication must
   occur at the first P(2) LSP and, since the LSP is destined for a
   first cousin, only a single P(1) LSR is traversed and so two state
   segments must be supported by the P(1) LSRs. When d1 is not a
   sibling, then it is either a first or second cousin of the source and
   so replication must occur at the first or second P(1) LSR
   respectively, with an additional state segment being necessary at
   that P(1) LSRs to reach d2. Lastly, if d2 is a second cousin of d1
   and d1 is a sibling of the source, replication occurs at the first
   P(2) LSP and, since two P(1) LSRs must be traversed to reach a second
   cousin, four state segments must be handled by P(1) LSRs. If d2 is a
   second cousin of d1, and d1 is not a sibling of the source,
   replication occurs at the first P(1) LSR and, since the LSP must
   traverse a second P(1) LSR, gives a total of three state segments.

   Similarly, for the number of state segments handled by the P(2) LSRs:

   X(2) = SUM [ SUM [ Prob(d1=D1)*Prob(d2=D2)*(fc(D1) + fd(D1, D2))]]
           D1    D2

   where

     fc(D1) = 2 if D1 is sibling
              4 otherwise

     fd(D1, D2) = 1 if D2 is sibling
                  2 if D1 is not sibling AND D2 is not sibling
                  3 if D1 is sibling AND D2 is not sibling

   fc(D1) simply states that the first PE in the receiving set, d1,
   requires two state segments to be supported at P(2) LSRs when it is a
   sibling of the source, and four states when it is not; two at each of
   the two P(2) LSR that must be traversed in this case.

   According to fd(D1, D2), when the second PE in the receiving set, d2,
   is a sibling of d1 it results in a single additional state segment


Komolafe, Farrel, and King                                     [Page 20]

draft-komolafe-mpls-te-p2mp-scaling-analysis-04.txt          August 2010


   being supported at the P(2) LSR, due to the replication that must
   occur there. If d1 is neither a sibling of the source nor d2, then
   replication must occur at a P(1) LSR and so reaching d2 adds two
   extra state segments at P(2) LSRs, corresponding to traversing the
   second P(2) LSR. If d1 is a sibling of the source but d2 is not, then
   replication occurs at the first P(2) LSR and, given the requirement
   to traverse a second P(2) LSR, produces a total of three state
   segments being supported by the P(2) LSRs.


   These two equations for X(1) and X(2) may be readily expanded to
   obtain the results given in Section 4.4 and have the advantage of
   being more easily adaptable as the size of the receiving set
   increases, an advantage exploited in the remainder of this document.

   Furthermore, these two equations may be adapted to consider the cost
   of establishing a P2P LSP, and so used to validate the equations
   against the results set out in [RFC5439]. For a P2P LSP, there is no
   d2, thus it may be said that:

     X(1:p2p) = 2*Prob(first cousin) + 4*Prob(second cousin)

   This gives the total mean number of state segments at all the P(1)
   LSRs when a single P2P LSP is established. The values for
   Prob(first cousin) and Prob(second cousin) from Section 1.4 may be
   substituted into the equation. To obtain the result matching Section
   3.1 and [RFC5439], we must multiply by S(PE) - 1 (since each source
   establishes an LSP to every other PE), multiply by S(PE) (since there
   are S(PE) sources), divide by 2 (since the number of state segments
   is twice the number of LSPs seen by the LSR for P2P LSPs), and divide
   by S(1) (since there are S(1) P(1) LSRs). This looks as follows:

   L1 = S(PE)*(S(PE)-1) *
          (2*Prob(first cousin) + 4*Prob(second cousin)) / 2*S(1)
      = S(PE)*(S(PE) - 1) *
          (2*M(2)(M(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1) +
           4*M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1) ) / 2*S(1)
      = 2*S(1)*M(1)*M(2)*(S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1) *
          (M(2)*(M(1) - 1) + 2*M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1)) /
                                             2*S(1)*(S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)
      = M(1)*M(2)*(2*S(PE) - M(2) - M(1)*M(2))

   Similarly:

     X(2:p2p) = 2*Prob(sibling) + 4*(1 - Prob(sibling))
              = 2*(2 - Prob(sibling))

   This gives the total mean number of state segments at all P(2) LSRs
   when a single P2P LSP is established. This result should be
   multiplied by S(PE) - 1 (since each source establishes an LSP to
   every other PE), multiplied by S(PE) (since there are S(PE) sources),
   divided by 2 (since the number of state segments is twice the number
   of LSPs seen by the LSR for P2P LSPs), and divided by S(1)*M(1)
   (since there are S1M1 P2 LSRs) to give the same result as found in
   Section 3.1 and [RFC5439]. This is achieved as follows:


   L2 = S(PE)*(S(PE) - 1)*
           2*(2 - Prob(sibling)) / 2*S(1)*M(1)
      = S(PE)*(S(PE) - 1)*
           2*(2 - (M(2) - 1)/(S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)) / 2*S(1)*M(1)
      = 2*S(1)*M(1)*M(2)*(S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1) *
          (2*(S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1) - M(2) + 1) /
                                        2*S(1)*M(1)*(S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)
      = M(2)*(2*S(PE) - M(2) - 1)

5. Three PEs in Receiving Set of P2MP LSPs

   The three nodes in the receiving set are d1, d2, and d3. Once again,
   d1 is the closest to the source, followed by d2, and lastly d3. Table
   4 summarizes all the different ways the P2MP LSP may be established
   and the respective number of state segments that must be supported by
   P(1) and P(2) LSRs.

   In reading Table 4, recall that:

     Prob(sibling) = (M(2) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

     Prob(first cousin) = M(2)*(M(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

     P(second cousin) = M(1)*M(2)*(S(1) - 1) / (S(1)*M(1)*M(2) - 1)

   In order to fit this table on the page, it is necessary to adopt some
   additional notation conventions as follows.

     sib  sibling
     1c   first cousin
     2c   second cousin
     p(x) Prob(x)

   Additionally, the equations for exact probabilities are represented
   by the roman numerals I-XV and are listed separately.

   Again, Let D be the set of possible locations for a given destination
   in a P2MP LSP and so

     D = {sibling, first cousin, second cousin}

   Using the patterns which may be observed in Table 4, generic formula
   for X(1) and X(2) may be computed as follows.

   X(1) = SUM [
           D1
              SUM [
               D2
                  SUM [ Prob(d1=D1)*Prob(d2=D2)*Prob(d3=D3) *
                   D3          (fe(D1) + ff(D1, D2) + fg(D1, D2, D3))]]]

   where

     fe(D1) = 0 if D1 is sibling
              2 if D1 is a first cousin
              4 if D1 is a second cousin

     ff(D1, D2) = 0 if D2 is sibling
                  1 if D1 is not a sibling AND D2 is a first cousin
                  2 if D1 is a sibling AND D2 is a first cousin
                  3 if D1 is not a sibling AND D2 is a second cousin
                  4 if D1 is a sibling AND D2 is a second cousin

     fg(D1, D2, D3) = 0 if D3 is sibling
                      1 if (D1 OR D2 is not sibling) AND
                                                      D3 is first cousin
                      2 if D1 is sibling AND
                                    D2 is sibling AND
                                          D3 is first cousin
                      3 if (D1 is not sibling OR D2 is not sibling) AND
                                                     D3 is second cousin
                      4 if D1 is sibling AND
                                    D2 is sibling AND
                                          D3 is a second cousin

   Similarly, for the number of state segments handled by the P(2) LSRs:

   X(2) = SUM [
           D1
              SUM [
               D2
                  SUM [ Prob(d=D1) * Prob(d2=D2) * Prob(d3=D3) *
                   D3         (fh(D1) + fi(D1, D2) + fj(D1, D2, D3)) ]]]

   where

     fh(D1) = 2 if D1 is sibling
              4 otherwise

     fi(D1, D2) = 1 if D2 is sibling
                  2 if D1 is not sibling AND D2 is not sibling
                  3 if D1 is sibling AND D2 is not sibling

     fj(D1, D2, D3) = 1 if D3 is sibling
                      2 if (D1 is not sibling OR D2 is not sibling) AND
                                                       D3 is not sibling
                      3 if D1 is sibling AND
                                    D2 is sibling AND
                                             D3 is not sibling

   It can be readily seen that there are similarities between the
   equations here and those for X(1) and X(2) in Section 4.5. The main
   difference is that, in the former equations, when considering the
   incremental cost of reaching the third PE in the receiving set, d3,
   the relative position of all the previous PEs in the receiving set
   must be taken into consideration. These similarities will be
   exploited to allow generic equations for the mean number of state
   segments that must be supported at P(1) and P(2) LSRs as a function
   of the receiving set size in Section 6.

6. Any Number of PEs in the Receiving Set of a P2MP LSP

   Sections 4 and 5 have shown the scalability parameters for a single
   P2MP LSP from a source PE to two and three PEs, respectively. It did
   this by estimating the average number of state segments that must be
   maintained by P(1) and P(2) LSRs. This section extends these findings
   by considering the case where there are an arbitrary number of PEs,
   N, which are receivers for the LSP.

   Comparing our two equations for X(1) (Sections 4.5 and 5) we can
   deduce a generic equation about the mean number of state segments
   that must be supported at the P(1) LSR when there are N PEs in the
   receiving set for the P2MP LSP:

   X(1) = SUM [ ... SUM [ Prob(d1=D1)*...*Prob(dN=DN)*
           D1        DN        (fa(D1)+fb(D1,D2)+...+fb(D1,...,DN))]...]

   where

     fa(D1) = 0 if D1 is sibling
              2 if D1 is first cousin
              4 if D1 is second cousin

     fb(D1,D2,...Dj) = 0 if Dj is sibling

   Similarly, for the number of state segments handled by the P2 LSRs,

   X(2) = SUM [ ... SUM [ Prob(d1=D1)*...*Prob(dN=DN)*

     fd(D1,D2,...Dj) = 1 if Dj is sibling
                       2 if any of D1, D2 ... Dj-1 is not sibling AND

                                                       Dj is not sibling

    These two equations for X(1) and X(2) give the values of the
    approximate mean number of state segments that must be supported by
    P(1) and P(2) LSRs when a P2MP LSP is set up from a single source to
    N destination PEa. These equations are used to obtain exemplar
    numerical results in Section 7.

7. Exemplar Numeric Results

7.1. Impact of Varying Topological Properties of the Network

   We can substitute the probabilities that a given PE is a sibling,
   first cousin, or second cousin (given by the equations in Section
   1.4) into the equations in Section 6 so that the number of state
   segments that must be supported by P(1) and P(2) LSRs, X(1) and X(2),
   can be computed as functions of the topological properties of the
   snowflake topology, M1, M2, and S1. This allows the impact of varying
   these topology parameters on the scalability to be investigated.

   A simple snowflake topology with M1, M2, and S1 all initially equal
   to 4 was considered. A P2MP LSP from every PE to 3 other randomly
   chosen PEs was established. Each one of M1, M2, and S1 was
   individually varied from 4 to 20 (with the other two parameters kept
   equal to 4) to allow the impact of varying each of these parameters
   individually to be shown in isolation. Table 5 shows the results.

   Table 5 shows that, typically, a greater number of average state
   segments must be supported by P(1) LSRs than P2 LSRs. This finding is
   unsurprising given that the topology of the snowflake network means
   it would be expected that a greater number of LSPs are concentrated
   in the core.

   It may be seen from Table 5 that increasing M(1) or M(2) leads to a
   linear increase in the number of state segments that must be handled
   at P(1) LSRs. This observation may be explained by realizing that
   increasing M(1) or M(2) (equivalently) increases the number of PEs
   subtended to each P(1) LSR and so more LSPs will be expected to be
   handled by this LSR. In contrast, increasing S1 increases the number
   of P1 LSRs but since the number of PEs subtended to each P(1) LSR
   remains unchanged (since M(1) and M(2) are unvaried in this case),
   the mean number of state segments remain relatively constant.

   Varying either M(1) or S(1) does not alter the number of PEs
   subtended to each P(2) LSR and so the mean number of state segments
   that must be handled by P(2) LSRs remains relatively unchanged. In
   contrast, increasing M(2) directly increases the number of PEs
   attached to each P(2) LSR and thus increases the number of state
   segments that such LSRs must handle accordingly.

7.2. Impact of Varying the Number of PEs in the Receiving Set

   The impact of varying the size of receiving set, N, when the
   topological properties of the network are kept constant is considered
   in this section. A simple snowflake topology in which M(1), M(2), and
   S(1) are all equal to 12, and in which N is varied from 1 to 10 is
   considered. Table 6 records the number of state segments that must be
   handled at P(1) and P(2) LSRs when the P2MP LSP is set up.

   For comparison, Table 6 also presents the results of establishing a
   corresponding set of P2P LSPs, allowing any benefits obtained by
   using P2MP LSPs instead of P2P to be quantified. The cost of
   establishing N P2P LSPs to the PEs in the receiving set was
   calculated by multiplying the cost of establishing a P2P LSP given
   in the equations for P2P LSPs in Section 4.5 by S(PE) * N since there
   are SPE sources of N P2P LSPs.

   Table 6 shows that, again, there is are more LSPs handled by P(1)
   LSRs than P(2) LSRs. Also, as would be expected, increasing the size
   of the receiving set increases the amount of state that must be
   supported by LSRs.

    Table 6 : Impact of Varying the Number of PEs in the Receiving Set
                      When P2P or P2MP LSPs are Used


   Using P2MP LSPs leads to LSRs having to support less state than if
   P2P LSPs are used. The relative reduction in the amount of state that
   must be supported by LSRs when P2MP LSPs instead of P2P LSPs are used
   is illustrated in Table 7. It can be seen that the relative reduction
   obtained by using P2MP LSPs initially rises with the size of the
   receiving set, before levelling off at around 24% and 45% for P(1) and
   P(2) LSRs respectively. It is perhaps surprising that using multicast
   does not achieve greater performance improvement; this finding may be
   explained by realizing that the approximations made in assuming the
   position of a subsequent PE in a receiving set is independent of the
   position of the preceding PEs means that the P2MP results presented
   here are close to the worst-case results. Basically, in a topology
   with M(1) = M(2) = S(1) = 12, Prob(second cousin) = 92% and so the
   worst-case P2MP LSPs in which all the destinations are second cousins
   (and so there are N replications at the first P1 LSR) is
   statistically the most likely scenario. Consequently, using multicast
   reduces the state predominantly only on the path from the PE to the
   first P(1) LSR, via the first P(2) LSR. On the other hand, had
   positions of preceding PEs in the receiving set been taken into
   consideration, the possibility of a given PE being a second cousin
   will diminish with the number of PEs in the receiving set which are
   already second cousins and so the probability of establishing the
   worst-case P2MP LSP will be lower.

   different types of LSRs in a snowflake network has been developed.
   The approach works by exhaustively aggregating the sum of the product
   of the cost and probabilities of all the different P2MP LSPs
   configurations.

   Open issues include:

   - Validating the mathematical model further.

     Successful validation against the results in [RFC5439] using two
     different approaches is encouraging, but these are for P2P variants
     of the model. It will be useful to attempt to sanity-check the
     results for the P2MP equations produce, perhaps using simulation.

   - Quantifying/removing approximations in mathematical model

     The approximation that the position of a subsequent PE in a
     receiving set is independent of the position of the preceding PEs
     should be investigated further and, ideally, removed. Getting rid
     of this approximation will complicate the mathematics more but is
     potentially worthwhile as it will make the results more accurate
     and remove the requirement that N < S(1) , M(1), and M(2).
     (Essentially, the goal should be to use the exact probabilities,
     for example, in Table 4). Doing so may be possible by exploiting
     patterns in the probabilities.

9. Management Considerations

   Management of networks with large numbers of MPLS-TE LSPs pose a 
   number of challenging network management problems. Some of these  
   issues are indentified and discussed within the relevant sections of 
   this document. Additional discussion of network management 
   considerations will be included in future versions of the 
   document.    

10. Security Considerations

   
Security considerations for MPLS can be found in [MPLS-SEC].

   Increasing the number of LSPs in a network to the point that the
   network is unmanageable or fails to operate constitutes as
   serious security risk.

11. Recommendations

   The authors would like to expand the analysis and validate the 
   mathematical models used in this study. Next steps are outlined in 
   section 8 (Conclusions and Open Issues) of this document. This 
   document does not make any specific recommendation at this time.  

12. IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests for IANA action.

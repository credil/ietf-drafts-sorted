                  Virtual Resource Management in Cloud
        draft-junsheng-cloud-virtual-resource-management-00.txt

Abstract

   In current Cloud and Data Center (DC) environment, the manageable
   virtualized resources aggregated by the Resource Management Platform
   (RMP) may be supplied by different types of hypervisor
   implementations.  The RMP needs to support a variety of hypervisor
   APIs to allow access, management and integration of different types
   of resources.  In order to decouple the RMP from any particular
   hypervisor implementation, a unified API needs to be developed.  This
   draft presents the requirements and preliminary implementation
   considerations for such an API.

Internet-Draft    Virtual Resource Management in Cloud         June 2011


1.  Introduction

   Based on the principle to simplify resource management, a unified,
   simple and lightweight Virtual Resource Management (VRM) API is
   required.  This VRM API is RESTful (Representational State Transfer)
   style based, supporting basic resource management functions, such as
   resource (de)registration, resource request, resource scheduling,
   resource access, resource configuration, resource binding, etc.  This
   API can be used in the interfaces of Resource Client (RC), Resource
   Manager (RM), and Resource Provider (RP) by using pairwise
   affiliation.

2.  Terminology

   Resource Pool:
       A resource pool is a set of resources available for assignment
       to services or applications. Resources in the resource pool can
       be assigned exclusively or shared by other resource consumer(s).

   Archive:
       An archive is a file-based representation of the state of a
       virtual machine at a given time. The archive includes
       configuration and disk data. Archives are useful for storing
       states that an administrator might want to return the VM to the
       same state of that point repeatedly.

   Snapshot:
       A snapshot is a collection of historical records (such as backup,
       clone or archive of virtual machine stored in Volume), as well
       as the place they are located. Snapshots contain primary source
       documents that have accumulated over the course of the lifetime
       of a resource or resource pool.

3.1.  Overview of Resource Management Architecture

   Resource management provides an efficient and effective way to
   access, control, manage, deploy, schedule and bind resources when
   they are provided by resource providers and requested by resource
   clients.  The architecture of resource management system includes the
   functional entities as listed in Figure 1.

          Figure 1: Overview of Resource Management Architecture



   The following five types of function entities exist in the
   architecture.

   o  Virtual Resource Manager (VRM).

      *  VRM provides registry of virtual resources to cloud service
         providers and allocation of virtual resources to resource
         clients (consumers).  This arises from the need to
         overcommitment resources, that is, when demand exceeds the
         capacity that single host/cluster can provide.

      *  VRM has its focus on providing flexibility, transparency and
         reliability.

Internet-Draft    Virtual Resource Management in Cloud         June 2011


   o  Virtual Resource Provider (VRP)

      *  VRP is the entity which provides virtualized resources to the
         cloud environment.  In the architecture above, it mainly refers
         to the hypervisors (virtualized case) and hosts (traditional
         non-virtualized case).

   o  Virtual Resource Client (VRC)

      *  VRC refers to the entity which consumes cloud resources to
         perform any task, such as instantiation of services or
         applications.

   o  Cloud System Management (CSM)

      *  CSM provides monitoring and administration of the RMP with the
         objective to keep the cloud system operating normally.

   o  Resource Pool (RPL)

      *  RPL is a collection of virtualized resources abstracted from
         physical resources, and it can be used to hierarchically
         partition the available virtualized resources.  RPL can be
         further divided into child RPLs.

      *  Resources in the RPL can be used exclusively by one VRC or can
         be shared among several VRCs.

      *  A set of allocated resources from (child) RPL with its setting
         data can be used to constitute virtual DC, virtual LAN or
         virtual Cluster, etc.

   The interfaces between the pairwise function entities is as follows.

   1.  Resource Register/Deregister Interface.

       *  The interface is between VRP and VRM.

       *  When powered on, VRP registers to VRM immediately to deliver
          resources.

       *  When powered off, VRP deregisters to VRM to cancel the
          availability of resources.

   2.  Resource Request Interface.

       *  The interface is between VRC and VRM.




Chu, et al.             Expires December 29, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Virtual Resource Management in Cloud         June 2011


       *  When VRC needs resources to perform services, it requests VRM
          to provide the requisite resources.  If the request is
          successful, the VRC will get eligible virtual resources.

       *  When VRC needs to get status related information of some
          resources, it requests VRM to provide the resources
          information.  If the request is successful, VRC will update
          the presentations of the resources in the client.

   3.  Resource Utilization Interface.

       *  The interface is between VRC and VRP.

       *  When requested resources are allocated, VRC interacts with VRP
          to bind and utilize the allocated resources for allocated
          time.

   4.  Resource Inquiry Interface.

       *  The interface is between VRM and RPL.

       *  When VRM receives resource request/inquiry from VRC, it
          inquire RPL to check the required resources from the delivered
          resources.

   5.  System Configuration Interface.

       *  The interface is between CSM and VRM, or CSM and VRP.

       *  The interface is used by CSM to monitor, configure and manage
          the RMP.

3.2.  Problem Statement

   There are various reasons and deployment scenarios where multiple
   types of hypervisors (such as VMware ESX/ESXi, Citrix Xen Server,
   Oracle VM, Microsoft Hyper-V, ZEN/KVM, etc.) need to coexist in one
   virualized environment (such as Cloud or DC).

   o  Applications/Services running on a hypervisor may gain better
      support or performance by running on the other different one.

   o  The existing hypervisor can't satisfy the required features or
      functions, such as disaster recovery, service continuity,
      security, reporting, etc.

   o  New system requirements or virtual machine demands can be served
      more efficiently or cost-effectively on a different hypervisor.

Internet-Draft    Virtual Resource Management in Cloud         June 2011


   o  Elimination of hypervisor vendor lock-in and avoidance of service
      unavailability when system upgrade or patching fails.

   o  Multiple choices can be offered to customers so that they can
      select their preferred platforms.

   With multiple hypervisors providing different types of resources to
   the virtualized environment (such as Cloud or DC), it is difficult
   for RMP to efficiently manage and coordinate the resources.

   o  Different hypervisors provide different VRM APIs and use different
      transport protocols.

   o  Different virtualization platforms provide different views of
      hierarchical resources.

   o  Different hypervisors have different ways to describe resource
      attributes.

   When the RMP consists of resources provided by multiple types of
   hypervisors, it needs to support different kinds of APIs.  Moreover,
   when a new hypervisor appears or existing hypervisor upgrades, the
   RMP needs to change accordingly.  It'll complicate the implementation
   of the RMP.

   Figure 2 shows the current RMP system supporting multiple
   hypervisor's APIs.

3.3.  Resource Management Standard Gaps

   System Virtualization, Partitioning and Clustering (SVPC) work group,
   chartered by DMTF, has released a series of standard profiles for
   managing system virtualization environments, including management of
   virtual computer systems and their associated virtual resources and
   host computer system virtualization including resource pools and
   resources allocation from those pools.  These profiles, all based on
   DMTF's Common Information Model (CIM), are now publicly available and
   are ready for implementation to reduce virtual system management
   complexity and cost.

   Objectives of the SVPC include:

   o  Create profiles for the management of:

      *  computer systems which are clustered for high availability or
         high-performance computing;





Chu, et al.             Expires December 29, 2011              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    Virtual Resource Management in Cloud         June 2011


      *  virtualization of computer systems and the associated
         resources;

      *  partitioning of computer systems and the associated resources;

      *  image formats for the provisioning and management of single and
         groups of virtual systems.

   o  optionally providing an application or service.

   o  Create specifications for virtual machine image formats.

   o  Create specifications for interoperability of virtualization
      management.

   o  White papers in support of the above objectives.

   o  Work with DMTF Interoperability committee, Virtualization
      Management Forum and System Management Forum to support an
      interoperability initiative for virtualization management.

   The work doing in SVPC WG and the problems identified from cloud and
   DC environments are all focus on virtual system management, but each
   concerns different aspects.  For SVPC WG, it concerns the
   virtualization layer and the full lifecycle of the hosted virtual
   computer systems, that is, standardize the internal realization of
   hypervisor platforms.  The work in cloud and DC environemnts concerns
   unified resource management platform to aggregate different types of
   resources provided by different types of hypervisors and to provide a
   set of virutal resources to satisfy the service deployment
   requirements and the customers resource requst/interaction
   requirements.

   The Profiles provided by SVPC WG can't be directly used for unified
   resource management platform in Cloud and DC enviroments to satisfy
   applications/services deployment requirements.

   o  The resource pool provided by SVPC aggregates only the homogeneous
      type of resources.  In Cloud and DC environment, resource pool
      means the aggregation of all types of virtual resources in the RMP
      domain.

   o  The interfaces provided by SVPC use CIM over HTTP.  In Cloud and
      DC environment, it may be more effective to use RESTful-based
      APIs.

   o  The profiles provided by SVPC specify service for the manipulation
      of virtual computer systems and their resources, but they do not

      provide mechanism on how to provide a set of resources to
      constitute a virtual DC or virtual LAN environment.

   Some work that are being done in SVPC WG can be use for the unified
   resource management in Cloud and DC enviroment.

   o  The modeling of virtual computer system, resource virtualization,
      resource allocation, and virtual system configuration helps to
      simplify the system management and to make the relationship
      between the host computer system and the virtual computer system
      clearly.

   o  The methods and properities defined for virtual systems, virtual
      devices, resource pools, and allocation capabilities help RMP to
      manage the resources in the hypervisor platform.

   o  The setting data, association, and state transfer help to
      configure the relationship between virutal resources and manage
      the lifecycle of the virtual system.

3.4.  Interface Requirements

   To solve the resource management problems faced by Cloud and DC
   environments and to simplify operations on the virtual resource
   management, the following three requirements must be met.

   o  The API needs to be hypervisor-agnostic.  It can be used by RMP to
      form a unified resource pool.

   o  The API needs to be simple and lightweight.  It can be implemented
      with the popular technologies, such as HTTP, URI, XML, JSON, etc.

   o  Resource pools or its child resource pools with the setting data
      can be provided to satisfy the services/applications deployment
      requirements, such as constituting Virtual DCs, virtual LANs or
      virual Clusters.

3.5.  VRM system with a unified API

   Following is a RMP system architecture that satisfies the described
   requirements above.  The unified VRM API can effectively reduce the
   complexity of the resource management.

   Figure 3 shows a RMP system supporting a unified interface to
   different types of hypervisors.

     Figure 3: A unified VRM API to multiple hypervisors in RMP


   With the unified VRM API, RMP can manage all kinds of resources
   provided by multiple hypervisors easily.  What the hypervisors need
   to do is to convert the VRM API into the hypervisor's own API through
   the Adaptor.

4.  REST used in Cloud Resource Management

4.1.  REST Design Best for Cloud Resource Management

   REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which was introduced
   in 2000 in the doctoral dissertation of Roy Fielding (one of the
   principal authors of the HTTP specification).  It is a software
   architecture style for distributed systems, and typically implemented
   in a servlet (hosting the REST service) that responds to HTTP
   requests.  The REST service will accept HTTP requests and parse them
   in order to determine what action to perform.  Depending on the
   request sent, different data is sent to and returned from the
   servlet.

   The REST API documents the patterns that are available for REST
   calls, and the actions that are available to be performed by the REST
   service.  The API also documents the data that must be sent with a
   REST request, and the data that is returned in a response from the
   REST service.

   REST style principles.

   o  Resources are addressable in REST.  Every "thing" on your network
      should have an ID.  With REST over HTTP, every object will have
      its own specific URI.

   o  Resources can be organized hierarchically with their URI
      identifications.

   o  A Uniform, Constrained Interface in REST.  When applying REST over
      HTTP, the methods provided by the protocol (GET, POST, PUT, and
      DELETE) can be used to operate resources.

   o  Representation oriented in REST.  Interactions with services can
      use different representations to describe the attributes of
      resource.  The representations may be XML, JSON, XHTML, etc.

   o  Communicate statelessly in REST.  Stateless applications are
      easier to scale.

   Compared with REST style principles, it is found that REST style
   design is best for virtual resource management.

   o  In cloud environment, physical equipments are virtualized and
      grouped into different kinds of virtual resources, such as virtual
      machines, virtual storages, virtual networks.  Virtual networks
      can be further divided into V-Routers, V-Switches, V-Firewalls,
      VPNs, V-Interfaces, V-Links which are abstracted from the physical

Internet-Draft    Virtual Resource Management in Cloud         June 2011


      Router/Switch/NIC equipments.  All these resources can be
      addressed by assigning a specific URI.

   o  Resources in cloud can be organized hierarchically, such as,
      partitioning cloud into many virtual DCs, partitioning a virtual
      DC into many RPLs, and partitioning a RPL into many child RPLs.

   o  In virtualization environment, operations on the resources mainly
      focus on resource (de)registry, resource request, resource binding
      and resource delete, so the HTTP verbs can satisfy the operation
      requirements.

   o  Attributes of resources in the resource interactions can be
      described with XML, JSON, XHTML, etc.

   o  In virtualization environment, operations on resources have no
      change to their identifiers, so resource operations can be
      designed as session irrelevant.

4.2.  REST in practice

4.2.1.  IBM WebSphere CloudBurst API

   WebSphere CloudBurst Appliance is a hardware appliance that provides
   access to WebSphere virtual images and patterns for easily, quickly
   and repeatedly creating application environments that can be securely
   deployed and managed in a private cloud.

   WebSphere CloudBurst has several mechanisms administrators can use to
   communicate with it.

   o  Administrative console.  It provides a Web browser-based UI that
      can be accessed to modify WebSphere CloudBurst settings, manage
      users, cloud resources and patterns, and deploy and monitor
      virtual systems.

   o  Command-line interface.  It allows users to manage their WebSphere
      CloudBurst appliance settings and cloud resources in a robust
      command-line tool.

   o  REST API.  It is an HTTP-based service that accepts HTTP requests
      and performs WebSphere CloudBurst actions depending on the type of
      request that is sent.  The REST API provides a mechanism for users
      to work with CloudBurst without having the need for a Java runtime
      environment.

   The IBM WebSphere CloudBurst administrative console and the command
   line interface provide a full set of WebSphere CloudBurst

   functionality, while the REST API can only provide a subset of all of
   the WebSphere CloudBurst features available.  The REST API is enabled
   by default and there are no extra configuration settings needed to
   enable it.  There is no way to disable the REST interface.  The IBM
   WebSphere CloudBurst REST API is available to be called by way of
   HTTPS on port 443.

   manage virtual infrastructure components like compute resources,
   virtual machines, networks, storage, and the like.

   The vSphere Web Services SDK facilitates the development of the
   client applications that target the VMware vSphere API.  It allows
   building SOAP-based applications to control ESX Servers / vCenter
   Servers and virtual machines running on them.  The SDK comprises of
   WSDL files, sample code in Java and C#, various libraries, and all

   The VMware vCloud API provides support for developers who are
   building interactive clients of VMware Cloud Director using a RESTful
   application development style. vCloud API clients and servers
   communicate over HTTP, exchanging representations of vCloud objects.
   These representations take the form of XML elements.

   A vCloud API client can use HTTP GET requests to browse containers
   such as organizations, catalogs, and vDCs.  Responses to these
   requests include metadata about the container itself and references
   to the objects it contains.  These references are provided in Link
   elements, which have href attributes whose values the client can use
   in requests to get more information about the objects themselves.
   This hierarchical structure of containers lends itself to graphical
   representation as a folder hierarchy or tree view of vCloud objects.

   Resources the VMware vCloud API supports include:

   o  API Versions.

4.2.6.  OGF/OCCI

   The Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) is a RESTful-based network
   Protocol and API for managing cloud computing infrastructure
   currently being created by the Open Grid Forum.  OCCI allows for the
   development of interoperable tools for common tasks including
   deployment, autonomic scaling and monitoring.  It has since evolved
   into an extensible API with a strong focus on interoperability while
   still offering a high degree of extensibility.  The current release
   of the OCCI is suitable to serve many other models in addition to
   IaaS, including e.g.  PaaS and SaaS.

   OCCI are described from three aspects.

   o  OCCI Core Mode.

      *  Core Mode defines a representation of resource types which is
         an abstraction of real-world resources, including the means to
         identify, classify, associate and extend those resources.

      *  Any resource exposed through OCCI is a Resource or a sub-type
         thereof.  The Resource type contains a number of common
         attributes that Resource sub-types inherit.  The Resource type
         is complemented by the Link type which associates one Resource
         instance with another.  The Link type contains a number of
         common attributes that Link sub-types inherit.

      *  OCCI Core Model types include Category, Kind, Mixin, Action,
         Entity, Resource and Link.

Internet-Draft    Virtual Resource Management in Cloud         June 2011


   o  OCCI Rendering.

      *  OCCI Rendering types include HTTP Header, XHTML5, etc.

      *  OCCI Rendering is a lightweight yet all-encompassing means to
         describe infrastructure.

      *  It provides the capability to send a native (e.g.  OVF, VMX)
         representation for clients that can digest such a native
         rendering.

   o  OCCI Infrastructure Model

      *  OCCI Infrastructure Model describes a particular OCCI
         Infrastructure extension for the IaaS domain.

      *  The main infrastructure types defined within OCCI
         Infrastructure are:

         +  Compute.  Information processing resources.

         +  Network.  Interconnection resource and represents a L2
            networking resource.

         +  Storage.  Information recording resources.

      *  Link sub-types for the Resource types are the following:

         +  NetworkInterface connects a Compute instance to a Network
            instance.

         +  StorageLink connects a Compute instance to a Storage
            instance.

4.2.7.  SNIA/CDMI

   The CDMI API provides the means to access cloud storage and to manage
   the data stored.

   Metadata is a convenient mechanism in managing large amounts of data
   with differing requirements through expressing those requirements in
   such a way that underlying data services differentiate their
   treatment of the data to meet those requirements.

   Resource types which are accessed through RESTful interface include:

   o  Container.

   The representations of resources typically nest.  For example, the
   representation of Cloud will include Templates and VDCs.  VDC will
   include representations of VMs, Volumes, Networks, Resource Pools and
   Hosts.  Resource Pool will further include its child resource pools.
   All these resource are organized hierarchically just as shown in the
   figure above.

5.2.  Transport Protocol

   The REST based VRM API is based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol,
   version 1.1 (RFC 2616).  Each request will be authenticated using
   HTTP Basic Authentication (RFC 2617) unless otherwise noted.

   Requests sent from clients on the public Internet (and not on a
   secure channel such as a VPN) MUST use the https protocol on port
   443.  TLS 1.1 (RFC 4346) shall be implemented by the provider and TLS
   1.2 (RFC 5246) is strongly encouraged.

5.3.  URI Space

   Resources in the cloud system are identified by URI Spaces which is
   controlled by the server.  VDCs, VMs, Templates, Volumes, Networks
   and RPLs are all identified by URIs.  To begin operations, a client
   must know the URI for a Space.  Then, Server will yield a
   representation of the canonical URI space containing links to the
   VDCs, VMs, Templates, Volumes, Networks and RPLs of that space in
   response message body.

5.4.  HTTP Header

   When using the REST based VRM API, it is necessary to be aware of
   certain HTTP headers that are required in every request.  A listing
   of those headers and a brief explanation of their uses are provided
   in Table 1.

5.4.1.  Request Headers

   In requests made to implement Cloud VRM API, several specific HTTP
   headers are used as described in the following table:

5.4.3.  HTTP Status Codes

   VRM API uses the HTTP protocol for sending and retrieving data.
   Client utilizing the REST API makes an HTTP request to the Server and
   process the HTTP response accordingly.  The status codes in HTTP
   response (RFC2616) gives the client some indication as to the success
   of the HTTP request, or the information on how the client should
   handle the included response data in failure case.

   Following table lists some common used HTTP response codes with their
   conditions.

5.4.4.  Media Type

   Resource representations of request and response bodies are normally
   encoded in JSON, as specified in RFC4627

   Each type of resource has its own media-type, which matches the
   pattern "application/vnd.ietf.cloud.Xxxxx+json", where "Xxxxx"
   represents the portion of the identifier unique to a particular
   representation format for each resource.  The identifier MUST be
   globally unique in the space of vnd.com.ietf.cloud, and the meida
   type should be registered in accordance to RFC4288.

5.5.  Resource Representations

   This section specifies the representations of the resources this API
   operates on.  The representations are made up of attributes, each
   with a name and value, encoded using a JSON dictionary.

   Each type of cloud resource has its own Internet Media Type.  The
   media type SHALL conform to the pattern "application/
   vnd.ietf.cloud.Xxxxxx+json".

5.5.1.  Cloud

   Cloud represents all accessible resources and deployed entities in
   cloud environment.

   HTTP Methods: GET

   Media Type:
      application/vnd.ietf.cloud.Cloud+json

5.5.2.  Template

   A Template represents the definition of the deployable resource or a
   group of resources (i.e. resource pool).  Users can create cloud
   resources by specifying the Template URI as a field in a deployment
   request.  The cloud SHALL instantiate the resources, their
   configurations and connection relations as specified in the
   definition of the Template.

   Template is a kind of resource which include subclass resource, such
   as VMTemplate, VolumeTeplate, vNetTemplate and RPLTemplate.

   HTTP Methods: GET/PUT/POST/DELETE.

   Following specifies subclass types of template.

   o  VMTemplate: a single OS-stack system on a virtualization platform.
      When deployed, a Server resource would be realized.

   o  VolumeTemplate: the storage relationships and rules that specify
      the storage behaviors.  It can be based on the CDMI metadata to
      specify the characteristics of a volume.  When deployed, a Volume
      resource would be realized.

   o  NetworkTemplate: the routing relationships and rules that specify
      the network behaviors.  When deployed, a VNet resource would be
      realized.

   o  RPLTemplate: a system topology that include multiple entities and
      their interconnections with deployment constraints.  When

5.5.6.  Volume

   Volume is the storage medium that is associated with a logical disk
   spanning on one or more hard disk drives.  It can be used for inter-
   operably configure storage by the computing cloud.

   CDMI Storage standard is RESTful style based, so when Volume
   management is coupled with the CDMI Cloud Storage standard, this API
   can be used to inter-operably configure storage for use by the

   Following specifies subclass types of network resource.

   Network Interface:
       A network interface is the point of interconnection between a
       computer and a private or public network. A network interface
       is generally a network interface card (NIC). But in virtualized
       environment, it represents a virtual interface of a virtual
       network device. An example of such an interface is a virtual
       NIC of a virtual machine on a server virtualization platform.

   Network Link:
       A network link is a connection between the two connected network
       interface. It represents an generic Ethernet cable in actual
       network environment. But in virtualized environemt, it represents
       a virtual network link used to connect two virtual network
       interfaces.  An example of such a link is a connection between
       a virtual machine and a virtual switch created on a server
       virtualization platform.

   Router:
       A router is a device or a piece of software in a computer that
       forwards and routes data packets across computer networks. It
       performs the data "traffic directing" functions on the Internet.
       But in virtualized environemt, it represents a virtual router
       used to forwards data packets across vlans.

   Network Switch:
       A network switch is a small device that joins multiple computers
       together within one local area network (LAN). Network switches
       are capable of inspecting data packets as they are received,
       determining the source and destination device of each packet, and
       forwarding them appropriately. But in virtualized environemt, a
       virtual network switch is a virtual version of a physical network
       switch. a virtual network can be configured to provide access to
       local or external network resources for one or more virtual
       machines.

   Network Firewall:
       A network firewall is a device or set of devices designed to
       permit or deny network transmissions based upon a set of rules

       and is frequently used to protect networks from unauthorized
       access while permitting legitimate communications to pass. But in
       virtualized environemt, it is a virtualized network firewall
       (VNF) service or appliance which provides the usual packet
       filtering and monitoring function via a physical network
       firewall. The VNF can be realized on a virtual machine, or on a
       purpose-built virtual security appliance, or on a virtual switch
       with additional security capabilities, or on a managed kernel
       process running within the host hypervisor.

   VPN Connection:
       A VPN connection is a secure network connection that is layered
       on top of a public network, such as the Internet, to the private
       network. Via VPN connections, remote computers acts as though
       they were on the same secure, local network.


5.5.7.1.  Network Interface

   An instance of the network interface is identified by a network end
   point and consists of a complete address that can be interpreted by
   the underlying network infrastructure.

6.  Conclusion

   The REST-based VRM API is a unified interface to integrate different
   kinds of resources provided by multiple vendor hypervisors.  The API
   is hypervisor agnostic, which can shield the influence of different
   vendor hypervisors to VRM and fit well the hierarchal virtual
   resource management.

7.  Security Considerations

   The RESTful-based VRM API as defined in this document provides access
   to the resources of the data center network.  This information could
   be used to aid an attack on the network.

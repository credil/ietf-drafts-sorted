Abstract
   SAFE Scripting Method is a model for allowing application
   interactivity in email while simultaneously elminating security
   vulnerabilities associated with client-side scripting.

Introduction
   SAFE (Server-side Asynchronous Framework Execution) Scripting Method
   has only two intended objectives:

   1) This model provides a method to allow behavior, or event-oriented,
   execution of programmatic application code across email.  Such code
   will be referred to as script.

   2) This models seeks to provide an alternative to client-side
   scripting of world wide web (WWW) documents free of security
   vulnerabilities with cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site
   request forgery (CSRF).

   Each of these objectives is mutually necessary for the functional
   existence of the other.  The SAFE model refers to the model of steps
   necessary to achieve the SAFE Scripting Method as explained below.

Requirements
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [34].

   Three externally defined requirements are necessary for the
   implementation of this proposed model.  One additional requirement is
   necessary and will be further expanded later in this document.  The
   external requirements MUST NOT be defined by this document.

   1) The first requirement is a standardized and well understood
   document structure definition, such as a markup language, that
   conforms to the conventions of the standardized Document Object Model
   (DOM) and accurately describes data intended for transmission across
   SMTP while simultaneously representing sufficient current common
   practices of representing or describing data intended for
   distribution as email or SMTP, which MUST NOT be (X)HTML.  This
   requirement shall be arbitrarily referred to as 'markup' for the
   remainder of this document.

   2) The second requirement is a standardized and widely adopted
   transmission scheme that reflects the primitive model defined by RFC
   5321 while simultaneously respecting the rules and constraints
   defined by the document structure noted in Requirement 1, markup.
   This requirement shall be arbitrarily referred to as 'protocol' for
   the remainder of this document and MAY be representitive of RFC 5598.

Internet-Draft             SAFE Scripting Method             August 2009

   3) The third requirement is a certificate authority granting
   organization that is entirely external to any organization providing
   Requirement 1 (markup) or Requirement 2 (protocol).  This requirement
   shall be arbitrarily referred to as CA, short for certificate
   authority, for the remainder of this document.

   4) The third requirement is the standardization and adoption of a new
   programming language object, XMLSmtpPush object, which is intended to
   offer comparable functionality to the XMLHttpRequest object available
   on the WWW.

Elaboration of intended objectives
   Allowing script execution in email is absolutely necessary to provide
   a minimal expectation of user experience and interaction, as well as
   promoting the advancement of data and commerce exchange.  Behavior
   and event oriented scripting in email must not be compared with
   similar functionality available on WWW.  On the WWW such scripting
   executes locally to the end user, which allows a degree of freedom
   and rapid programmatic response not available to this model at the
   cost of frequent security violations.

   In this model scripts are executed on an email server, a mediating
   agent of the data transmission that is never an end point of that
   transmission.  Execution occurs in response to an event, specific
   expected data, a defined document feature, or other programmatic
   condition.  This means the code executed by any script language must
   be pushed back to the initiated user as either a new document or as
   an asynchronous alteration to an established document.

   The reason why scripts must be executed on the server and not the
   client is to eliminate security vulnerabilities associated with
   script execution.  Understandably, this opens new and more difficult
   to detect security vulnerabilities where compromises violate
   expectations of privacy.  Email is inherently private and it is the
   liability of the distant server's owner to ensure data that passes
   through that mail server remains private through best current
   security practices.

                    +-----------+         +-----------+

SAFE Model
   The SAFE model exists to allow transmission interactivity through
   execution of script opposed to programmatic interactivity that exists
   only through use of client-side programming language execution in
   WWW.  In other words, the SAFE Model exists to provide interaction
   using dynamic communications that do not result in new or separate
   content documents that would appear to be additional emails.  The
   mail clients MUST be expected to execute changes to the DOM of an
   establish document but MUST NOT process any other instructions with
   regard to this model or transmission interaction.  This is secure
   because changes to the DOM only allow for the deletion, addition, or
   alteration to text or markup code data to a document only.  The SAFE
   model expects that all communications will be encrypted as a result
   of assymmetric key exchange.

SAFE - Step One
   In the SAFE Model the first step is to establish authorization
   between the two communicating clients to ensure the distant client
   is not a forged identity or spoofed address.  If authorization is not
   established encryption could be exist with a fraudulent identity.  A
   CA, as defined in Requirement 3, is necessary to ensure the integrity
   of the authorization process.

Internet-Draft             SAFE Scripting Method             August 2009

   The distant client MUST respond with a digital certificate signed
   with a digital signature.  Upon certificate receipt the initiating
   client MUST contact the issuing CA to recieve a key to decrypt the
   digital signature.  Since this key can only decrypt signatures signed
   with a private key stored at the distant user authorization is
   verified.  This CA MUST NOT be on the same domain as either client
   address or any email server mediating in the transmission in order to
   provide an uncompromised validation of trust.  This process SHOULD be
   transparent to the user of the originating client.

                        +-----------+ Signature
                        |           |  Public   +------------+
  +------------+        |  Third    |    Key    | Initiating |
  | Initiating |------->|  Party    |---------->|   Client   |
  |   Client   |        |    CA     |           +------------+
  +------------+        |           |               Decrypt
        ^               +-----------+              Signature
        |
  +-----------+         +-----------+
  |           | Signed  |           |
  |   Mail-   | Digital |           |    +---------+
  |  Server   |  Cert   |  Distant  |    | Distant |
  |    of     |<--------|   Mail-   |<---| Client  |
  |   Local   |         |  Server   |    +---------+
  |  Domain   |         |           |
  |           |         |           |
  +-----------+         +-----------+

SAFE - Step Two
   The second step is for both communicating clients to share public
   keys and engage in asymmetric encryption only after authorization is
   verified using Step One.  If the initiating client inserts their
   public key in the first communication to the distant client, using a
   convention providing by the markup language for describing public
   keys, and the distant client responds with their public key, using
   the same markup convention, this step is unnecessary as both clients
   already have each others public key.  Otherwise additional
   communications are required to exchange public keys between the
   initiating client and distant client.

SAFE - Step Three
   The third step is for the initiating client to engage in
   communication to the distant client, such as sending an email.  When
   the distant client is ready to engage script execution it must prompt
   its local mail server to initiate Step Four.  This communication
   between the distant client and its local mail server MAY occur using
   any transmission protocol even if that protocol is not affiliated
   with email or SMTP and even if that method of communication is
   proprietary.  When communicating to the distant mail server the
   distant client MUST include the public key value of the initiating
   client.

                    +-----------+         +-----------+
                    |           |         |           |1.  +---------+
  +------------+    |   Mail-   |         |           |--->|         |
  | Initiating |    |  Server   |         |  Distant  |    | Distant |
  |   Client   |--->|    of     |-------->|   Mail-   |2.  | Client  |
  +------------+    |   Local   |         |  Server   |<---|         |
                    |  Domain   |         |           |    +---------+
                    |           |         |           |
                    +-----------+         +-----------+

SAFE - Step Four
   The forth step is for the distant client's email server to send a
   public key exchange request to the initial client.  The distant mail
   server must have a public/private key pair that is entirely unique
   and not affiliated with the key pair used by the distant client.
   This separate key pair is necessary, because it notifies the initial
   client that it will be engaging in communication with a different
   entity and it prevents accidental or involuntary entry into a model
   of script execution.  This additional notification provides the
   initiating user a final opportunity to disallow use of the SAFE Model
   for any reason.  Only the distant mail server needs to send a message
   with its key value since it was provide the initiating client's
   public key in Step Three.

  +------------+           |           |           |           |
  |            |           |   Mail-   |           |           |
  | Initiating |<----------|  Server   |<----------|  Distant  |
  |   Client   |           |    of     |           |   Mail-   |
  |            |           |   Local   |           |  Server   |
  +------------+           |  Domain   |           |           |
                           |           |           |           |
                           +-----------+           +-----------+

SAFE - Step Five
   The fifth step is for the initial client and distant email server to
   engage in encrypted communication.  At this point communication
   between the initiating client and the distant mail server MAY occur
   as many times as the distant mail server sends a response to the
   initiating client or as many times as the initiating client
   communicates to the distant mail server only.

SAFE - Step Six
   The sixth step is to close communications between the initiating
   client and the distant mail server and then send a notification to
   the distant client.  This communication from the distant mail server
   to the distant client verifies that SAFE Model communication has
   occured and properly terminated.  The termination communication MUST
   contain the final communication that is intended to be delivered to
   the distant client.

Internet-Draft             SAFE Scripting Method             August 2009

   Once the SAFE Model has terminated the private data stored on the
   distant mail server MUST be destroyed or purged.  If an interruption
   to communication occurs, so that a proper termination is never
   generated, the distant server MUST provide a defined timeout by which
   all stored communication will be automatically destroyed or purged.
   The initiating client SHOULD be provided with the opportunity to
   terminate the SAFE Model at every possible opportunity.

SAFE - Step Seven
   The distant client MUST send an automated response email to the
   initiating client once the distant client verfies termination of the
   SAFE Model.  If the distant client fails to send a response within a
   given timeout, specified by the initiating client's user agent from
   the time of most prior response, the SAFE Model MUST be presummed to
   have failed.  If the SAFE Model has failed the initiating client MAY
   start over in order to initiate a new SAFE Model instance or MAY
   communicate directly to the distant client without use of the SAFE
   Model.

SAFE - Summary
   The end result of the SAFE Model is that communication may be
   encrypted between two distant clients and a separate simultaneous
   application session may be established between an independent third-
   party which is already present in the transmission path of the two
   clients.  This effectively means, given SMTP derived protocols as a
   push transmission, the initiating client will be communicating
   directly to the distant client while such communications may be
   intercepted and automatically responded to by the distant server.
   The distant server, however, MUST be a mediating agent of
   communication and MUST NOT be a destination of communication.

Additional security constraints applied to SAFE Model
   * All script, or programmatic execution, that is to occur during the
   SAFE Model MUST occur only from code that resides locally on the
   distant server.  Local is defined as the single operating system on
   which the single specific mail server executes or resides.  Scripts
   or other programmatic code MUST NOT request, refer to, or source in
   any code that is not stored local to the executing server.

   * Any code specified to execute during the SAFE Model MUST reside as
   a new instance of the original code in a single 'sand-boxed' location
   so that other code is not executed by mistake and code is not open to
   security compromises as a result availability to a data transmission.

   * Communications that arise between the distant server and initial
   client in the SAFE Model MUST be considered temporary and private.
   The distant server MUST NOT pass communication received or generated
   from the SAFE Model to the distant client until except for the final
   terminating communication of the SAFE Model to the distant client.

Internet-Draft             SAFE Scripting Method             August 2009

   *It is RECOMMENDED that a separate email address be specified for a
   distant client that is present to receive maintenance and status data
   from the distant server.  This is entended to ensure that there is no
   collusion of maintenance data and user communication.  Maintenance
   data and other gathered data, such as statistics, MUST NOT be
   reported or generated with uniquely identifiable user information,
   content, or header data.  Such data MAY be generated for internal
   reporting to the owner of the distant mail server and distant client
   if it cannot be matched against uniquely identifiable user data.

   * Communications sent from the distant server MUST be sent with the
   same MIME content type as the data received by the distant server
   from the initiating client.  If this results in incompatibilities at
   the distant mail server the distant mail server MUST properly
   terminate the SAFE Model, but send an error report to the distant
   client instead of the intended communication.

   * The CA MUST NOT reside within the same domain as either the
   initiating client, the initiating client's direct mail server, the
   distant server, or the distant client.

XMLSmtpPush object definition
   This programmatic object exists to allow script code to open a
   transmission path from a point of execution to a known addressable
   point independent of the communication details specified in either
   the tranmission header information or document specifications.  This
   transmission path MUST be a unidirectional path from the agent of
   execution, typically the agent of execution would be the distant
   server of the SAFE Model, to the addressable provoking entity, which
   would typically be the initial client of the SAFE Model.  This
   represents a fire and forget method of transport where the agent of
   execution sends data once and expects to never receive either a
   success or failure transmission status.  The XMLSmtpPush object MUST
   NOT open a tranmission to any destination other than the provoking
   entity.

   The XMLSmtpPush object MUST retrieve data from the most recent
   document header specific in the markup language, if available, or if
   that is not available then from the packet header of the transmission
   protocol.  If the header data is not understood, not defined, or not
   well-formed the data MAY be transported with RFC 5322 conformant
   headers.  Data transmitted by this object using RFC 5322 conformant
   headers SHOULD NOT expect successful or accurate interaction with the
   intended document.

   Despite its name, the XMLSmtpPush object is not intended for limited
   implementation across the SMTP protocol only.  The object is intended
   for functional operation across any protocol that conforms to the
   defined protocol requirements of RFC 5322, or compatible protocols,
   and its primitive models.

XMLSmtpPush object methods
   abort()
   The abort() method stops the current request by closing the
   transmission path before any data is sent if the transmission path is
   opened and returns a value of "false".  If a transmission path is not
   opened a value of "false" is returned.  This method is required to
   occur at least once per open method.  If this method does not occur
   to close an open method an error MUST be thrown.

   getHeaderDatagram()
   The getHeaderDatagram() method returns the header names and values in
   a JSON object or multidimensional array.  If the document header
   cannot be detected or understood a value of null MUST be returned.

   getHeader("headername")
   This method returns the string value of a single specified header if
   the specified header exists, otherwise this method returns a value
   of null.

   open()
   The open method opens an asynchronous transmission path from the
   executing agent to the provoking entity.  The open method MUST NOT
   send data.

   send(variable1,variable2,...)
   The send method MUST send data to the provoking entity.  The send
   method MUST NOT open or prepare a transmission path, which is the
   function of the open method.  This means a send method MUST execute
   only after an open method has executed.  If a send method attempts to
   execute without a prior instantiated open method an error MUST be
   thrown.  This granular strict functionality between the open and send
   methods is intended to provide script authors greater control of
   various different data sets to be sent while simultaneously reducing
   complexity derived from such granularity.

   The send method expects to receive instructions for altering a
   document and the new content that is to be provided, if any, where
   such instructions are stored in a function defined as a single named
   variable.  Such a named function SHOULD be conservative in its
   instructions and liberal in its static content.  The specified
   instructions MUST be expressed as DOM methods, XPath expressions,
   and/or the innerHTML method with anticipation that such instructions
   will be processed by the client without decisions or formatting onto
   the instructions, its content, or its perceived impact on the
   document.  DOM instructions MUST be specific to the document received
   by the agent of execution, or they SHOULD expect to fail to execute
   at the provoking entity.

Internet-Draft             SAFE Scripting Method             August 2009

Processing role of the client
   The client MUST be prepared to execute DOM instructions, XPath
   expressions, or the innerHTML method.  Any other client-side script
   execution MUST NOT occur aside from meta-language parsing of a
   document only with regard to the appropriate meta language the markup
   language conforms to.  The user MUST NOT be allowed to interfere with
   the processing of such instructions.  If the user did not wish for
   such instructions to execute the user would not have voluntarily
   allowed execution of the SAFE Model.

   The intent is to remove security vulnerabilities associated with
   client-side code execution requests from a message by pushing those
   vulnerabilities onto a server not directly associated with the user.
   The user SHOULD be fully aware that data MAY be coming in as
   asynchronous updates and not new documents by convention of the SAFE
   Model.

Security
   Client-side script execution is associated with highest quantity of
   security vulnerabilities in computing.  By eliminating client-side
   on the web and instead using SAFE can nullify most of these problems.

IANA Considerations
   This document contains no IANA considerations.

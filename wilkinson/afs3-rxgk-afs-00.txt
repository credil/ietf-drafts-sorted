Internet-Draft          Integrating rxgk with AFS           January 2010


1.  Introduction

   rxgk [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-rxgk] is a new GSSAPI [RFC2743] based
   security layer for the RX remote procedure call system.  The rxgk
   specification details how it may be used with a generic RX
   application, this document provides additional detail specific to
   integrating rxgk with the AFS distributed file system.

   AFS differs from the standard rxgk implementation in that it does not
   require GSSAPI negotiation with each server.  Instead, a client
   negotiates with a central location (the vlserver), and receives a
   token which can then be used with any server in the cell.  This
   requires that all servers have an identical cell wide pre-shared key
   for token encryption.

   For more complex cell topologies, servers which do not share the
   cell-wide key are supported by means of an extended CombineTokens
   call.  This call takes a server identifier, and will return a token
   encrypted with a key for a specific server.  This extended call,
   AFSCombineTokens, also provides support for indicating whether a
   specific server is rxgk capable, allowing cells to securely migrate
   to rxgk from other security mechanisms.

   We also define mechanisms for securing the callback channel which is
   created between fileserver and client.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Security Index

   When used within the AFS protocol, rxgk has a securityIndex value of
   4


3.  Key negotiation

   An AFS cell wishing to support rxgk MUST run an rxgk key negotiation
   service, as specified in [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-rxgk], on each of its
   vlservers.  The service MUST listen on the same port as the vlserver.

   The GSS identity afs-rxgk@_afs.<cellname> is the acceptor identity
   for this service.  Where multiple vlservers exist for a single cell,
   all of these servers must have access to the key material for this



Wilkinson                 Expires July 16, 2010                 [Page 3]

   identity, which MUST be identical across the cell.  Clients MAY use
   the presence of this identity as an indicator of rxgk support for a
   particular cell.  Clients which wish to support cells using other rx
   security objects MAY downgrade if this identity is not available.

   Tokens returned from the GSSNegotiate call MUST only be used with
   database servers.  Tokens for fileservers MUST be obtained by calling
   AFSCombineTokens before each server is contacted.

3.1.  The AFSCombineTokens operation

   AFS extends the existing CombineTokens operation to provide a more
   general token manipulation service.  This operation takes a user
   token, an optional cache manager token, and a destination identifier,
   and returns a token specific to the specified destination.

       AFSCombineTokens(IN RXGK_Data *token0<>,
                        IN RXGK_Data *token1<>,
                        IN afsUUID destination,
                        OUT RXGK_Data *new_token<>) = 3;

   token0:  An rxgk token obtained using the GSSNegotiate rpc

   token1:  Either, an rxgk token obtained using the GSSNegotiate rpc,
         or empty (0 length)

   destination:  The UUID of the server this token is indented for.
         Fileserver UUIDs may be obtained from the VLDB in the same call
         as returns their addresses.

   new_token:  A new rxgk token, or empty

   The AFSCombineTokens call MUST only be performed over an rxgk
   protected channel, with a security level of 1 (integrity) or more.
   Servers MUST reject all attempts to perform this operation over
   channels that are not protected in this way.

   Clients which are caching the results of RPCs on behalf of multiple
   users (such as a traditional AFS Cache Manager), SHOULD provide both
   the user's token (as token0) and a token generated from an identity
   that is private to the cache manager (as token1).  This prevents a
   user from poisoning the cache for other users.  Recommendations on
   keying cache managers are contained below

   Clients which are working on behalf of a single user can provide an
   empty token1, but MUST use AFSCombineTokens to obtain a destination
   specific token for each fileserver they contact.

Internet-Draft          Integrating rxgk with AFS           January 2010


   If the returned token is 0 length, then the destination does not
   support rxgk, and the client MAY fall back to using a different
   authentication mechanism for that server.  This is the only situation
   in which an rxgk capable client operating within an rxgk enabled cell
   may downgrade its choice of security layer.

   Keys and tokens are combined in the same way as the CombineTokens
   call, documented in [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-rxgk].


4.  Tokens

4.1.  Container

   rxgk tokens for AFS take the form of some key management data,
   followed by an encrypted data blob.  The key management data (a
   version number, followed by an [RFC3961] encryption type) allows the
   recipient to identify which pre-shared key has been used to encrypt
   the token itself.

       struct RXGK_TokenContainer {
         afs_int32 kvno;
         afs_int32 enctype;
         opaque    encrypted_token<>;
       }

4.2.  Token Encryption

   Token contents are encrypted using a pre-shared key. rxgk supports
   the use of both a single cell-wide key and the use of per-server
   keys.  The cell-wide key must be installed on all servers which are
   capable of accepting cell-wide tokens.  Cell-wide keys should be for
   a selected RFC3961 encryption mechanism which is supported by all
   servers within the cell.  Per-server keys should be for an encryption
   mechanism which is supported by both the destination server, and the
   negotiation service.  The management of per-server keys is discussed
   in more detail below.

   Key rollover is permitted by means of a key version number.  When the
   key is changed, a different key version number MUST be selected.
   Servers SHOULD accept tokens using the old key until the lifetime of
   all existing tokens has elapsed.

   Encryption is performed over the XDR encoded RXGK_Token structure,
   using the RFC3961 encrypt operation, with a key usage value of 1036
   (RXGK_SERVER_ENC_TICKET)

Internet-Draft          Integrating rxgk with AFS           January 2010


4.3.  Token Contents

   The token itself contains the information expressed by the following
   XDR:

       struct RXGK_Token {
         afs_int32 enctype;
         opaque    K0<>;
         afs_int32 level;
         afs_int64 starttime;
         afs_int32 lifetime;
         afs_int32 bytelife;
         afs_int64 expirationtime;
         struct PrAuthName identities<>;
       }

   enctype:  The RFC3961 encryption type of the session key contained
         within this ticket

   K0:   The session key (see the rxgk specification for details of how
         this key is negotiated between client and negotiation service).

   level:  The security level that MUST be used for this connection

   starttime:  The time, expressed as a 100ns value, since the Unix
         epoch.  Servers MUST reject attempts to start connections with
         tokens that are not yet valid.

   lifetime:  The maximum number of seconds that a key derived from K0
         may be used for.  This is an advisory limit.  If 0, keys have
         no time based limit

   bytelife:  The maximum amount of data (expressed as log 2 byes) that
         may be transferred using a key derived from K0.  This is an
         advisory limit.  If 0, there is no data based limit on key
         usage

   expirationtime:  The time (expressed as the number of 100ns since the
         Unix epoch) beyond which this token may no longer be used.
         Servers MUST reject attempts to use connections secured with
         this token after this time has passed.  A time of 0 indicates
         that this token never expires.

   identities:  A list of identities represented by this token. struct
         PrAuthName is the identity structure defined in
         [I-D.brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names]

4.4.  Time

   THIS SECTION WILL BE REMOVED BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This document uses 64bit time values, with a granularity of 100ns -
   the currently proposed mechanism for representing 64 bit time in AFS.
   This proposal has yet to be standardised - it is intended that this
   document will evolve to match whatever AFS standardises upon.


5.  Authenticator data

   The appdata opaque within the RXGK_Authenticator contains the XDR
   encoded UUID of the client.  The UUID is encoded using the afsUUID
   type.


6.  Client tokens

   In order to protect users of a multi-user cache manager from each
   other, it must be impossible for an individual user to determine the
   key used to protect operations which affect the cache.  This requires
   that the cache manager have key material of its own which can be
   combined with that of the user.  This functionality is provided by
   the AFSCombineTokens call specified earlier in this document.
   However, this call requires that a cache manager have access to a
   token for this purpose.

6.1.  Keyed clients

   Where a host already has key material for a GSSAPI mechanism
   supported by rxgk, that material may be used to key the client.  The
   client simply calls the rxgk negotiation service using the relevant
   material, and obtains a token.  The client should frequently renew
   this token, to avoid combined tokens having unnecessarily close
   expiration times.

   It is recommended that identities created specifically for use by a
   cache manager have the name afs3-callback@<hostname> where <hostname>
   is the fully qualified domain name of the cache manager.

6.2.  Unkeyed clients

   When a client has no key material, it is possible that an anonymous
   GSSAPI connection may succeed.  Clients MAY attempt to negotiate such
   a connection by calling GSS_Init_Sec_Context() with the anon_req_flag
   [RFC2743] and the default credentials set.

Internet-Draft          Integrating rxgk with AFS           January 2010


7.  Server to server communication

   A number of portions of the AFS protocol require that servers
   communicate amongst themselves.  To secure this with rxgk we require
   both a mechanism of generating tokens for these servers to use, and a
   definition of which identities are permitted for authorisation
   purposes.

7.1.  Ticket printing

   A server with access to the cell-wide pre-shared key may print its
   own tokens for server to server access.  To do so, it should
   construct a token with suitable values.  The list of identities in
   such a token MUST be empty.  It can then encrypt this token using the
   pre-shared key, and use it in the same way as a normal rxgk token.
   The receiving server can identify it is a printed token by the empty
   identity list.


8.  Declaring rxgk support for a fileserver

   The AFSCombineTokens call has specific behaviour when a destination
   endpoint does not support rxgk.  Implementing this behaviour requires
   that the vlserver be aware of whether a fileserver supports rxgk.

   Fileservers currently register with the vlserver using the
   VL_RegisterAddrs RPC.  Fileservers which support rxgk MUST call this
   RPC over a rxgk protected connection.  The vlserver should then note
   the rx security layer used in registration, and infer rxgk support
   from that.  To prevent downgrade attacks, once a fileserver has
   registered as being rxgk capable, the vlserver MUST NOT remove that
   registration without administrator intervention.

   Once a fileserver has been marked as supporting rxgk,
   VL_RegisterAddrs calls for that fileserver MUST only be accepted over
   an rxgk protected link.


9.  Per server keys

   The provision of servers with their own keys, rather than the cell
   wide master key, requires the ability to maintain a directory of
   these keys on the vlserver, so that the AFSCombineTokens RPC can
   encrypt the outgoing token with the correct key.  The manner in which
   this directory is maintained is down to the implementor, who MAY
   decided to use a manual, or out of band key management system

   Implementations supporting automatic key management through the AFS3

   protocol MUST provide the following RPC

       struct RXGK_ServerKeyDataRequest {
           afs_int32 enctypes<>
           opaque nonce1<>
       };

       struct RXGK_ServerKeyDataResponse {
           afs_int32 enctype;
           afs_int32 kvno;
           opaque nonce2<>
       };

       VL_RegisterAddrsAndKey(
           IN afsUUID *uuidp,
           IN afs_int32 spare1,
           IN bulkaddrs *ipaddr,
           IN afs_int32 secIndex,
           IN opaque *keyDataRequest<>,
           OUT opaque *keyDataResponse<>) = XXX;

   uuidp:  As the existing VL_RegisterAddrs RPC

   spare1:  As the existing VL_RegisterAddrs RPC

   ipaddr:  As the existing VL_RegisterAddrs RPC

   secIndex:  The index of the security mechanism for which a key is
      being set.  For rxgk, this value should be '4'

   keyDataRequest:  An opaque blob of data, specific to the security
      mechanism defined by secIndex.  For rxgk it is, the xdr encoded
      representation of RXGK_ServerKeyDataRequest

   keyDataResponse:  An opaque blob of data, specific to the security
      mechanism defined by secIndex.  For rxgk it is the xdr encoded
      representation of RXGK_ServerDataResponse

   The client provides, in the RXGK_ServerKeyDataRequest structure, a
   list of the RFC3961 encryption types that it will accept as a server
   key.  It also provides a nonce containing 20 random data bytes.

   The server selects an encryption type shared by it and the client,
   and returns that, along with 20 bytes of random data that it has
   generated, in RXGK_ServerKeyDataResponse.  If there is no common
   encryption type, then the server must fail the request.

   The server key can then be derived by both client and server using

          random-to-key(PRF+(K0, K, nonce1 || nonce2))

   random-to-key is the function specified by the RFC3961 profile of the
   encryption type chosen by the server, and returned in enctype.

   PRF+ is the function of that name specified by [RFC4402]

   K0 is the master key of the current rxgk session, as originally
   determined by the GSSNegotiate call.

   K is the key generation seed length as specified in enctype's RFC3961
   profile


10.  Securing the callback channel

   AFS has traditionally had an unprotected callback channel.  However,
   extended callbacks requires a mechanism for ensuring that callback
   breaks and, critically, data updates, are protected.  This requires
   that there is a strong connection between the key material used
   initially to perform the RPC, and that which is used to protect any
   resulting callback.  We achieve this using the cache manager token
   discussed earlier, which is required in order for a client to accept
   secure callbacks

   A cache manager may set a key for secure callbacks by issuing the
   following RPC (part of the AFS_ family)

       AFS_SetCallbackKey(afs_int32 securityIndex,
                          opaque mech_data<>) = XXX;

   securityIndex:  The securityIndex of the mechanism for which this key
         is being set.  In the rxgk case, this will be rxgk's security
         index, as defined earlier.

   mech_data:  This contains the security object specific data.  In
         rxgk's case this is an XDR encoded RXGK_Token structure.

   When used with rxgk, this RPC MUST be performed over an rxgk
   protected link established using solely the cache manager's token.
   This connection MUST have a security level of 2 (encrypted).

   If a fileserver receives a AFS_SetCallbackKey protected with a
   different cache manager identity than the previous call from that
   client, it MUST break all secure callbacks held by that client using
   the old key before this RPC completes.

   Only RPCs issued over an rxgk protected connection should receive

Internet-Draft          Integrating rxgk with AFS           January 2010


   rxgk protected callbacks

   The fileserver MUST only send rxgk protected callbacks when one of
   the identities performing the RPC establishing that callback matches
   the identity associated with that clients callback channel.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


12.  Security Considerations

12.1.  Downgrade attacks

   Using the presence of a GSSAPI key to determine a cell's ability to
   perform rxgk is vulnerable to a downgrade attack, as an attacker may
   forge error responses.  Cells which no longer support rxkad SHOULD
   remove their afs@REALM and afs/cell@REALM Kerberos keys.

12.2.  Per server keys

   The mechanism for automatically registering per server keys is
   potentially vulnerable, as it trades a short lived key (the rxgk
   session key, which protects the key exchange) for a long life one
   (the server key)

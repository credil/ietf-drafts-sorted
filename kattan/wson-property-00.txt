Abstract

   Wavelength Switched Optical Network will extend GMPLS protocols to to
   manage wavelength across DWDM optical networks.  In many situations
   the control plane needs to know additional information regarding
   wavelengths.  The current proposal identify a way to carry some
   property information along with wavelength information.  Control
   plane can leverage the knowledge of such properties during its
   operations.

1.  Introduction

   One of the current Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) evolutions is toward the
   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) as described in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-framework].  A related work is defined
   within [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-g-694-lambda-labels] defining the GMPLS
   label in a format suitable for Lambda Switched Capable (LSC
   equipments).

   Todays WSON networks are implemented through DWDM technologies and
   they treats all light paths as equal regardless of the type of data,
   bandwidth and mission criticality of the traffic it is carrying.

   This draft suggests the introduction of some properties like
   prioritizing light paths for scenarios such as restoration, fiber
   congestion and resource contention.  This could be achieved in
   assigning properties information to each light path.  Following
   sections will describe some scenarios where such information will be
   useful.  How those information are assigned is out of the scope of
   this draft.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Scenarios

   The following list identify several scenarios occurring in operating
   WSON networks where some wavelength information will help.  Note that
   this scenarios are triggered by the availability of new
   reconfigurable equipments allowing new level of flexibility within
   DWDM networks.

   Example of this hardware would be multi-degree Reconfigurable Optical
   Add Drop Multiplexers or ROADMs to support mesh DWDM networks.  Fiber
   1 is an example of a meshed DWDM network where multiple light path
   are being set up to and from node C.

   (a)  Prioritize then Restore

        With the reference to Figure 2 we can consider a dual fiber cut
        on the path A-C and D-C.  A lambda prioritization might be used
        to ensure high priority light paths be served first.  This will
        ensure both a faster restoration time compared to other channels
        as well as the ability of high priority light paths to grab
        first (before other lower priority light paths) the available
        resources on the working fiber.

   (b)  Revertive Operation

        In this scenario, a fiber is being restored and hence having a
        high priority light paths restored first might or might not be
        desirable.  Setting a revertive or not revertive option would be
        useful in this scenario.  Moreover, in the event of multiple
        fiber cuts with only one fiber restored as an example,
        prioritizing light paths will ensure higher priority traffic
        will get the best service as well as up time once the WSON
        restoration mechanism kicks in.  Other possibilities inlcude
        defining some others lambda properties like a "no not restore
        bit" or "Wait time to restore" to allow the control plane
        operates according to different restoration strategies.

   (c)  Network Optimization

        Similar to revertive operation, prioritizing light paths will
        also be useful in network optimization.  High priority traffic
        will always get the option to ride on the best available fiber
        path.  Also high priority light path could be provided with the
        option to get the best performance OI parameters to chose from.

   (d)  Service Level Agreement support

        This could be useful for DWDM service providers where light
        paths are tagged with different parameters so that to create a
        desirable and configurable level of SLA.  This SLA could be
        derived from bandwidth (100G, 40G and 10G), traffic type (TDM vs
        IP/Eth or FC payload) or just a network management defined
        requirement.

   (e)  Resource Contention

        In the event of one or multiple fiber cuts, we could be faced
        with a situation whereby the number of light paths to be
        restored is larger than the available light path resources on
        the working fiber (see Figure 2 above).  Having light paths
        prioritization together with a wait-time-to-restore will ensure
        that the high priority traffic will be served first and hence
        will be able to grab the available resources first.

   include in a control plane.

   the wavelength after a failure.

   Wait-Time-to-Restore.  This information will report a time elapsed
   before a wavelength go through a restoration process.

   Hold-OfF-Time.


4.  Lambda Properties Encoding

   The lambda priority will be encoded over three bits.  There are
   different encoding possibility depending on the protocol used to
   distribute this information over the control plane.

   It worth noting that GMPLS extension in [RFC4202] and [RFC4203]
   already define LSP priority bandwidth within Interface Switching
   Capability Descriptor sub-TLV.  This concept however does not suffice
   for WSON LSP for the scenario represented above.

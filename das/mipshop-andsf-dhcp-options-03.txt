Abstract 
    
   This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  
   (DHCPv4 and DHCPv6) options to enable a mobile node to discover
   Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) entities 
   in an IP network. ANDSF is being developed in 3GPP and provides 
   inter-system mobility policies and access network specific 
   information to the mobile nodes(MNs). ANDSF is specified in 
   [3GPPTS23.402].

1. Introduction 

   Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) is being
   defined in 3GPP (Release-8) to provide necessary network discovery 
   and selection assistance data to the mobile nodes for multi-access 
    
   network scenarios where 3GPP access-network level solutions are not
   sufficient for the mobile nodes to perform network discovery and
   selection of non-3GPP networks[3GPPTS23.402]. 

   The information provided by ANDSF contains inter-system mobility 
   policies and access network specific data to assist the mobile 
   node with performing the inter-system handover. This set of 
   information can either be provisioned in the mobile node by the 
   home operator, or provided to the mobile node (MN) dynamically by 
   the ANDSF over the S14 reference point as defined in [3GPPTS23.402]. 

   In 3GPP, the ANDSF is located either in the subscriber's home 
   operator or visited network and needs to be known to the MN or 
   discovered by the MN. According to [3GPPTS23.402] the ANDSF is 
   discovered through interaction with the Domain Name Service function 
   or the DHCP Server function. 

   This document defines new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options called the ANDSF 
   IP Address Option and ANDSF Domain List Option, which allow the MN to 
   locate an ANDSF Server. 
    
 
2. ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4
    
   This section describes the ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4. 
   The Option begins with an option code followed by a length and one 
   or more IP addresses. The option layout is depicted below:


     0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

ANDSF DHCP Options                                      February 2010 


   Length 
    	
                An 8-bit field indicating the length of the option  
                excluding the 'Option Code' and the 'Length' fields 

   IP Address
    
                IPv4 address(es) of ANDSF Server(s) 


   If the length is followed by a list of IPv4 addresses indicating 
   appropriate ANDSF servers available to the MN, servers MUST be 
   listed in order of preference and the client should process them 
   in decreasing order of preference. In case there is no ANDSF server 
   available, the length is set to 0, otherwise it is a multiple of 4.  
   The Option has the following format: 
   
           Code Len    IPv4 Address 1    IPv4 Address 2 
         +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---- 
         | XX  | n  |a1 | a2  | a3 | a4 | a1 | ... 
         +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---- 
    
 
3. ANDSF Domain Name List Option for DHCPv4 
    
   This section describes the ANDSF Domain Name List Option for DHCPv4. 
   The format of this option is depicted below:
  
     0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   
    Option Code 
    
                OPTION-IPv4_FQDN-ANDSF (To Be Assigned) - 1 byte  
    
     Length 	
                An 8-bit field indicating the length of the option  
                excluding the 'Option Code' and the 'Length' fields 

      Domain Name List
    
                FQDN(s) of ANDSF Server

ANDSF DHCP Options                                     February 2010

   When the total length of an ANDSF Domain Name List Option exceeds 
   254 octets, the procedure outlined in [RFC3396] MUST be employed 
   to split the option into multiple, smaller options. 

   The encoding for this option has the following format: 

           Code  Len   DNS name of ANDSF server 
         +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---- 
         | XX  | n  | s1 | s2 | s3 | s4 | s5 | ... 
         +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---- 

   The Option begins with a code followed by a length and a sequence 
   of labels that are encoded according to Section 8 of [RFC3315].
   
   When the MN discovers one or more FQDNs, it SHALL resolve those  
   according to the procedures as specified in [RFC1035]. The list of 
   domains MAY contain the domain name of the ANDSF servers of the 
   network provider and its partner networks that also offer ANDSF 
   capabilities.

   As an example, consider the case where the server wants to offer 
   two ANDSF servers, "example.com" and "example.net".  These would 
   be encoded as follows:  
   +-----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
   | XX  |26 | 7 |'e'|'x'|'a'|'m'|'p'|'l'|'e'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'| 0 | 
   +-----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
   | 7 |'e'|'x'|'a'|'m'|'p'|'l'|'e'| 3 |'n'|'e'|'t'| 0 | 
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 


4. ANDSF IPv6 Address option for DHCPv6 
    
   This section describes the ANDSF IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6. 
   The Option begins with an option code followed by a length 
   and one or more IP addresses. The value of the length octet does 
   not include itself or the option code. The option layout is 
   depicted below:


      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Length value) as described in Section 3. The value of the Option 
   Code and Length are 2-octets and the Length does not include 
   itself or the Option Code field. 

   The semantics and content of the DHCPv6 encoding of this option are
   exactly the same as the encoding described in Section 3, except the  
   Option Code and Length value.

      
                 
6. Option Usage 
    
6.1 Usage of ANDSF Options for DHCPv4 
     
   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv4 options follow the 
   rules for DHCP options in [RFC2131]. 
     
6.1.1 Mobile Node behavior 
    
   The mobile node performs ANDSF discovery procedure either during 
   initial association with a network or when the policy and access 
   network information is required from ANDSF. It may also try to 
   perform the ANDSF discovery when the network information is outdated 
   or mobile does not have any ANDSF information. MN SHOULD always query 
   for the IP address, unless the operator policy requires to discover 
   the FQDN, in which case the MN will need to request for the domain 
   name.
    
   In order to request an address or domain name of a ANDSF Server, the
   mobile node(DHCP client) MUST include either an ANDSF IPv4 Address 
   Option or ANDSF Domain Name List Option in the Parameter Request List
  (PRL)in the respective DHCP messages as defined in [RFC2131]. 


6.1.2 DHCP Server behavior 
    
   When the DHCP server receives either an ANDSF IPv4 Address Option or 
   ANDSF Domain Name List Option in the PRL, the DHCP server MUST 
   Include the option in its response messages (as defined in [RFC2131])
   that may contain a list of one or more IP addresses or a list of one
   or more FQDNs of the ANDSF server hosting the service.

ANDSF DHCP Options                                       February 2010



   In case that the server cannot find any ANDSF Server satisfying 
   the requested Option Code, the server MUST return the ANDSF Option 
   by setting the Option Code to the requested Option Code and the 
   length of the Option to 0.
. 
  
6.2 Usage of ANDSF Options for DHCPv6  
    
   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv6 options follow 
   the rules for DHCP options in [RFC3315]. 

  6.2.1 Mobile node behavior 
    
   The mobile node performs ANDSF discovery according to the procedures 
   described in Section 6.1.1. 
 
   In order to discover the address or domain name of an ANDSF Server, 
   the mobile node(DHCP client) MUST include either an ANDSF IPv6 
   Address Option or ANDSF Domain Name List Option in the Option Request
   Option (ORO) in the respective DHCP messages as defined in [RFC3315].


6.2.2 DHCP Server behavior 
   
   When the DHCP Server receives either an ANDSF IPv6 Address Option 
   or ANDSF Domain Name List Option in the ORO, the DHCP server MUST 
   include the option in its response (as defined in [RFC3315])that 
   may contain a list of one or more IP addresses or a list of one or
   more FQDNs of the ANDSF server hosting the service. 
   
   In case that the server cannot find any ANDSF Server satisfying 
   the requested Option Code, the server MUST return the ANDSF Option 
   by setting the Option Code to the requested Option Code and the 
   length of the Option to 0.

 
7. Security Considerations 
    
   The security considerations in [RFC2131] apply. If an adversary 
   manages to modify the response from a DHCP server or insert its own 
   response, an MN could be led to contact a rogue ANDSF Server. 
   
   It is recommended to use DHCP authentication option described in 
   [RFC3118] where available. This will also protect the denial of 
   service attacks to DHCP servers. [RFC3118] provides mechanisms for 
   both entity authentication and message authentication.

ANDSF DHCP Options                                      February 2010  
    


   In deployments where DHCP authentication is not available, 3GPP 
   specific lower layer security services may be sufficient to protect 
   DHCP messages. 

   Regarding domain name resolution, it is recommended to consider the 
   usage of DNSSEC [RFC4033] and the aspects of DNSSEC Operational
   Practices [RFC4641].

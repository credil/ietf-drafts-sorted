ANDSF DHCP Options                                       October 2010 
 
Abstract 
    
   This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  
   (DHCPv4 and DHCPv6) options to enable a mobile node to discover
   Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) entities 
   in an IP network. ANDSF is being developed in 3GPP and provides 
   inter-system mobility policies and access network specific 
   information to the mobile nodes(MNs).

1. Introduction 

   Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) is being
   defined in 3GPP [3GPPTS23.402] to provide necessary network 
   discovery and selection assistance data to the mobile nodes for 
   multi-access network scenarios where 3GPP access-network level 
   solutions are not sufficient for the mobile nodes to perform 
   network discovery and selection of non-3GPP networks. 

   The information provided by ANDSF contains inter-system mobility 
   policies and access network specific data to assist the mobile 
   node with performing the inter-system handover. This set of 
   information can either be provisioned in the mobile node by the 
   home operator, or provided to the mobile node (MN) dynamically by 
   the ANDSF over the S14 reference point as defined in [3GPPTS23.402]. 

   In 3GPP, the ANDSF is located either in the subscriber's home 
   operator or visited network and needs to be known to the MN or 
   discovered by the MN. According to [3GPPTS23.402] the ANDSF is 
   discovered through interaction with the Domain Name Service function 
   or the DHCP Server function. 

   This document defines new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options called the ANDSF 
   IP Address Options, which allow the MN to locate an ANDSF Server. 
    
 
2. ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4
    
   This section describes the ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4. 
   The Option begins with an option code followed by a length and 
   one or more IP addresses. The option layout is depicted below:


     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Length 
    	
                An 8-bit field indicating the length (in bytes) of 
                the option in bytes excluding the 'Option Code' and 
                the 'Length' fields. 

   IP Address
    
                IPv4 address(es) of ANDSF Server(s) 

   If the length is followed by a list of IPv4 addresses indicating 
   appropriate ANDSF servers available to the MN, servers MUST be 
   listed in order of preference and the client SHOULD process them 
   in decreasing order of preference.  The Option has the following 
   format where `zero` is not a valid `Length` field: 
   
           Code Len    IPv4 Address 1    IPv4 Address 2 
         +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+--------- 
         | XX | n  |a1  | a2 | a3 | a4 | a1 | ......

3. ANDSF IPv6 Address option for DHCPv6 
    
   This section describes the ANDSF IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6. 
   The Option begins with an option code followed by a length 
   and one or more IP addresses. The value of the length octet does 
   not include itself or the option code. The option layout is 
   depicted below:


     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     .                                                               .
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+ 
     
 Option Code 
    
             OPTION-IPv6_Address-ANDSF (To Be Assigned) - 2 bytes  

   
   Length 
             A 16-bit field indicating the length (in bytes) of the 
             option excluding the 'Option Code' and the 'Length' 
             fields.

 IP Address
    
             IPv6 address(es) of ANDSF Server(s) 
   
   The Option follows the same format (except the Option Code and  
   Length value) as described in Section 2. The value of the Option  
   Code and Length are 2-octets and the Length does not include 
   itself or the Option Code field. 
 
   If the length is followed by a list of IPv6 addresses indicating 
   appropriate ANDSF servers available to the MN, servers MUST be 
   listed in order of preference and the client SHOULD process them 
   in decreasing order of preference. The Option has the following 
   format where `zero` is not a valid `Length` field: 
   
           Code Len    IPv6 Address 1    IPv6 Address 2 
         +----+----+----+---------+-----+----+--------- 
         | XX | n  |a1  | . . . . | a16 | a1 | ...... 
         +----+----+----+---------+-----+----+--------- 
               
                 
4. Option Usage 
    
4.1 Usage of ANDSF Options for DHCPv4 
     
   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv4 options follow 
   the rules for DHCP options in [RFC2131]. 
     
  4.1.1 Mobile Node behavior 
    
   The mobile node MAY request the IP address of an ANDSF server 
   either during initial association with a network or when the 
   policy and access network information is required from ANDSF. It 
   MAY also request the IP address of an ANDSF server when the network 
   information is outdated or mobile does not have any ANDSF 
   information. 
    
   In order to request an address of a ANDSF Server, the mobile node 
   (DHCP client) MUST include an ANDSF IPv4 Address Option in the 
   Parameter Request List(PRL)in the respective DHCP messages as 
   defined in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132]. DHCP client handling PRL options
   is specified in RFC2131, Section 4.4.


  4.1.2 DHCP Server behavior 
    
   When the DHCP server receives an ANDSF IPv4 Address Option in the 
   PRL, the DHCP server MUST process and respond according to the

ANDSF DHCP Options                                       October 2010

   
   behavior specified in RFC 2131. In particular, DHCP server handling 
   PRL options is specified in RFC2131, Section 4.3.

  
4.2 Usage of ANDSF Options for DHCPv6  
    
   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv6 options follow 
   the rules for DHCP options in [RFC3315]. 

  4.2.1 Mobile node behavior 
    
   The mobile node MAY request the IP address of an ANDSF server
   according to the scenarios described in Section 4.1.1. 
 
   In order to discover the address of an ANDSF Server, the mobile 
   node(DHCP client) MUST include an ANDSF IPv6 Address Option in the 
   Option Request Option (ORO) in the respective DHCP messages as 
   defined in [RFC3315]. DHCP client handling ORO options
   is specified in RFC3315, Sections 17.1 and 18.1. 


  4.2.2 DHCP Server behavior 
   
   When the DHCP Server receives an ANDSF IPv6 Address Option in the 
   ORO, the DHCP server MUST process and respond according to the 
   behavior specified in RFC 3315. In particular, DHCP server handling 
   ORO options is specified in RFC3315, Sections 17.2 and 18.2. 

   
 
5. Security Considerations 
    
   If an adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCP server 
   or insert its own response, an MN could be led to contact a rogue
   ANDSF Server. A modified response could also be used to mount an
   amplification attack.
   
   DHCP authentication option described in [RFC3118] MAY be used to 
   mitigate the above attacks. In deployments where DHCP authentication 
   is not available, 3GPP specific lower layer security services can be 
   used to protect DHCP messages[3GPPTS33.402]. 3GPP ANDSF 
   framework also provides additional mechanisms that can also be used 
   to protect message exchanges between ANDSF client and server at the 
   higher layer [3GPPTS33.402].

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines two new DHCP options as described in Sections 
   2 and 3. 

   ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4(OPTION-IPv4_Address-ANDSF) TBA

   ANDSF IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6 (OPTION-IPv6_Address-ANDSF) TBA

Abstract
    
   This document proposes a simple and effective approach to emulate
   E-Tree services over an MPLS network. Section 4 presents a minimal 
   extension to the current VPLS architecture defined in [RFC4761] and
   [RFC4762] to fulfil the specific E-Tree requirement: Leaf cannot
   communicate with Leaf. Backward compatibility issues are addressed
   also.

Internet Draft        Extension to VPLS for E-Tree          January 2010 
                                     

1. Introduction 

   A specific type of multipoint Ethernet services has been defined by 
   Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF), called E-Tree [MEF6.1]. At the difference 
   of E-LAN where there is no communication restriction between 
   endpoints, on E-Tree each endpoint is designated as either a Root or 
   a Leaf. Root can communicate with all other endpoints on the E-Tree, 
   however Leaf can only communicate with Roots but not Leafs.

   The work in progress [Draft ETree Frwk] proposes a solution framework 
   for supporting MEF E-Tree services over a MPLS network.

   E-LAN services are currently emulated via the use of the VPLS 
   architecture.

   This document presents a minimal extension to the current VPLS 
   architecture defined in [RFC4761] and [RFC4762], with the objective 
   to provide a simple and effective approach to fulfil the additional 
   requirements of E-Tree compared to E-LAN.

   Backward compatibility issues are also addressed in this document. 
   PEs supporting the extension specified in this document and PEs not 
   supporting such extension can inter-operate and participate in the 
   same VPLS instance.

   This document does not intend to address efficient packet replication 
   or bandwidth optimisation, but the approach presented here does not 
   prohibit future enhancements on those aspects.

   In this document, "current standard" refers to [RFC4385], [RFC4447],
   [RFC4448], [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].

2. Terminology

   E-Tree 
   
   An Ethernet VPN in which each Root AC can communicate with every
   other AC, whereas Leaf ACs can only communicate with Root ACs. Each 
   AC on an E-Tree construct is designated as either a Root AC or a Leaf 
   AC. There can be multiple Root ACs and Leaf ACs per E-Tree construct.

   Root AC 

   An ingress frame at a Root AC can be delivered to one or more of
   any of the other ACs in the E-Tree. Please note that this AC is
   bidirectional.

   Leaf AC 
   
   Ingress frame at a Leaf AC can only be delivered to one or more Root
   ACs in the E-Tree. Ingress frame at a Leaf AC MUST NOT be delivered
   to any Leaf ACs in the E-Tree. Please note that this AC is 
   bidirectional.

3. Reference Model

   Figure 1 below describes a generic reference model where PE1, PE2 and 
   PE3 need to establish an E-Tree construct between different Ethernet 
   endpoints. Each PE has 2 Root ACs and 2 Leaf ACs connected to a VSI. 
   These VSIs are then linked together via Ethernet PWs.

   In most use cases, an E-Tree construct has only a few Root ACs but 
   many Leaf ACs. There may be only Root ACs or only Leaf ACs on a PE.

   With an E-Tree construct:
     - A Root AC can receive from and transmit to any other ACs.
     - A Leaf AC can receive from and transmit to any Root ACs.
     - A Leaf AC cannot receive from and transmit to any other Leaf ACs.

   This applies to all traffic, including Unicast Known, Unicast 
   Unknown, Broadcast and Multicast.  
 
   When an Ethernet Frame is received on PE1 via AC1, the frame can be 
   transmitted to any other local ACs on PE1 and via Ethernet PWs to any 
   remote ACs on PE2 and PE3.

   However when an Ethernet Frame is received on PE1 via AC3, the frame 
   can be transmitted to any other local Root ACs on PE1 and via 
   Ethernet PWs to any remote Root ACs on PE2 and PE3, but the frame 
   cannot be transmitted to any local Leaf ACs on PE1 nor any remote 
   Leaf ACs on PE2 and PE3.

4. Extension to VPLS for E-Tree

4.1 AC Type 

   Each AC connected to a specific VPLS instance on a PE MUST have an AC 
   Type attribute, either Leaf AC or Root AC. The default value for AC 
   Type attribute MUST be Root AC.

   This AC Type is only locally configured on a PE and no signaling is 
   required between PEs.

4.2 Control Word  

   A PE MUST be capable of sending and receiving the Control Word on 
   Ethernet PW. Use of Control Word on Ethernet PW MUST be PREFERRED.

   The procedure for negotiating the use of Control Word as per current 
   standard is sufficient and MUST be followed. As a result, Control 
   Word will always be used on Ethernet PW between two PEs when both PEs 
   support the extension specified in this document.

   Refer to Appendix A for different Control Word scenarios.

4.3 Additional Action in Data Forwarding

   A PE MUST support the Control Word L-bit defined in [Draft CW L-bit]. 

   A PE MUST perform the additional actions specified in Table 1 below.

   The "Set CW L-bit" action and "Forward or Drop" decision are in 
   addition to and performed after the following
      - MAC-based forwarding decision as per current standard
      - Loop free VPLS "split horizon" rule (MUST NOT forward traffic 
        from one PW to another PW in the same VPLS mesh) as per current 
        standard

                Table 1: Additional Action in Data Forwarding

   "Forward Frame to" is the result of MAC-based forwarding decision as 
   per current standard.

   "CW L-bit" is the bit 4 in the Ethernet PW Control Word as defined in 
   [Draft CW L-bit] (the 5th bit in Control Word since the first bit is 
   bit 0). The CW L-bit = 1 if and only if the payload Ethernet frame is 
   from a Leaf AC.

   Refer to Appendix B for different data forwarding scenarios.

5. Backward Compatibility

5.1. AC Type

   Since there is no restriction on communication between any ACs 
   connected to a VPLS instance as per current standard, on a PE not 
   supporting the extension specified in this document, an AC is 
   functionally equivalent to a Root AC as per the extension specified 
   in this document.

5.2. Control Word

   For backward compatibility reason, use of Control Word on Ethernet PW 
   is not mandatory. If the PE on the other end prefers not to use 
   Control Word or does not support Control Word (which implies such PE 
   does not support the extension specified in this document), then 
   Control Word will not be used on the Ethernet PW.

   Refer to Appendix A for different Control Word scenarios.

5.3. Additional Action in Data Forwarding

   For backward compatibility reason, a PE not supporting the extension 
   specified in this document can participate in an E-Tree construct, 
   but only Root ACs can be connected to such PE. 

   Lack of Control Word L-bit per-payload signaling between a PE 
   supporting the extension specified in this document and a PE not 
   supporting such extension does not result in any problem.

   Refer to Appendix B for different data forwarding scenarios.

5.3.1 Ingress PE Support the Extension but Egress PE Not 
   
   If Control Word is used on the Ethernet PW, the ingress PE will set 
   CW L-bit to either 0 or 1 (Rule 3 and Rule 4 in Table 1). The egress
   PE will ignore the reserved bits (which include the L-bit position) 
   as per current standard [RFC4448] and forward the frame. This is 
   correct as only Root ACs exist on a PE not supporting the extension 
   specified in this document. A Root AC can receive from any other ACs.
   
   If Control Word is not used on the Ethernet PW, there will be no CW
   L-bit. The egress PE will forward the frame as per current standard. 
   This is correct as only Root ACs exist on a PE not supporting the 
   extension specified in this document.  A Root AC can receive from any 
   other ACs.

Internet Draft        Extension to VPLS for E-Tree          January 2010 


5.3.2 Egress PE Support the Extension but Ingress PE Not
 
   If Control Word is used on the Ethernet PW, the ingress PE will set 
   the reserved bits (which include the L-bit position) to 0 as per 
   current standard [RFC4448]. The egress PE will process it as CW L-bit 
   = 0, which means the frame is from a Root AC. The is correct as only 
   Root ACs exist on a PE not supporting the extension specified in this 
   document. A Root AC can transmit to any other ACs.
 
   If Control Word is not used on the Ethernet PW, there will be no CW
   L-bit. The egress PE will process it in the same way as CW L-bit = 0 
   (compare Rule 7 and Rule 8 in Table 1), which means the frame is from 
   a Root AC. This is correct as only Root ACs exist on a PE not
   supporting the extension specified in this document. A Root AC can
   transmit to any other ACs.

6. Optional Enhancements for Leaf-only PE

   It is important to note that the enhancements specified in this
   section are OPTIONAL for achieving an E-Tree implementation using
   VPLS.

   In the context of a specific VPLS instance, a Leaf-only PE means that 
   the PE only has Leaf ACs connected to it. In Figure 2 below, PE2 and 
   PE3 are Leaf-only PEs.

6.1. No PW between Leaf-only PEs

   With an E-Tree construct, a Leaf AC cannot receive from and transmit 
   to any other Leaf ACs. Pseudowire PW23 is between two Leaf-only PEs, 
   and is therefore not supposed to carry any traffic. If removal of
   such pseudowire can bring significant benefits, enhancement in this
   aspect may be desirable.

6.2. Not Forward Frame from Leaf AC to Leaf-only PE

   When PE1 receives a Broadcast frame via AC2, PE1 will set CW L-bit to
   1 and forward the frame to pseudowires PW12 and PW13. PE2 receives
   the frame via PW12 but does not forward it to any ACs. A similar
   situation occurs for PE3. Network bandwidth is consumed and then the
   egress PE decides to drop the frame. This applies to any frames
   (Broadcast, Multicast, Unicast Known, Unicast Unknown) from a Leaf AC
   towards a Leaf-only egress PE. If such traffic pattern is significant
   in volume, enhancement in this aspect may be desirable.

   Each PW on a PE MUST have an Leaf-only attribute, either Yes or NO,
   indicating whether the peer PE at the other end of the PW is a
   Leaf-only PE or not. The default value for Leaf-only attribute MUST
   be No.

   A PE MUST NOT forward a data frame on a PW with Leaf-only = Yes if
   any of the following conditions is true
      - The frame is from a Leaf AC
      - The frame is from PW and the CW L-bit = 1

   The Leaf-only attribute for each PW can be locally configured on a
   PE for each PW, or MAY be decided through signaling between PEs.

   For LDP VPLS, Interface Parameter Sub-TLV can be used for such
   signaling, refer to section 5.5 in [RFC4447].

   For BGP VPLS, Signaling PE Capability can be used for such signaling,
   refer to section 3.2.4 in [RFC4761].

   PE-rs MUST treat each spoke PW to PE-r equivalent to an AC of the 
   VPLS instance (consider it as an AC extended by a P2P PW), and MUST
   support the extension specified in section 4.1 (AC Type) and section
   4.3 (Additional Action in Data Forwarding) for such spoke PWs in the
   same way as ACs. 

7.1.4. Hierarchical VPLS Model using Ethernet Access Network

   This refers to section 11 in [RFC4762].

   In the Ethernet access network, Root endpoints and Leaf endpoints of
   the VPLS instance need to be grouped in separate VLANs. A VLAN of
   Root endpoints connects to a Root AC on the PE-rs. A VLAN of Leaf
   endpoints connects to a Leaf AC on the PE-rs. It is assumed that the
   Ethernet access network has some sort of filtering mechanism to stop
   communication between Leaf endpoints but this is outside the scope of
   this document.

   PE-rs MUST support the extension specified in section 4 of this
   document.

Appendix A.  Control Word Scenarios

   As per current standard [RFC4447]: If both endpoints prefer the use 
   of the control word, this procedure will cause it to be used. If 
   either endpoint prefers not to use the control word or does not 
   support the control word, this procedure will cause it not to be 
   used. If one endpoint prefers to use the control word but the other 
   does not, the one that prefers not to use it is has no extra protocol
   to execute; it just waits for a Label Mapping message that has c=0.

   There are three possible scenarios.

   +----------+--------------+--------------------------+--------------+
   |          |      PE1     |           PE2            | Control Word |
   | Scenario +--------------+------------+-------------+  used on PW  |
   |          | Support this |Support this|   Support   |  between PE1 |
   |          |  Extension?  | Extension? |Control Word?|   and PE2?   |
   +----------+--------------+------------+-------------+--------------+
   |    1     |    Yes       |    Yes     |      Yes    |     Yes      |
   +----------+--------------+------------+-------------+--------------+
   |    2     |    Yes       |    No      |      Yes    |     Yes      |
   +----------+--------------+------------+-------------+--------------+
   |    3     |    Yes       |    No      |      No     |     No       |
   +----------+--------------+------------+-------------+--------------+

                     Table 2: Control Word Scenarios

   For Scenario 2, although Control Word is used on the Ethernet PW, the 
   two PEs process the Control Word L-bit differently:
      - PE1 will always set and interpret the CW L-bit as specified in 
        [Draft CW L-bit], i.e. 0 = from Root AC; 1 = from Leaf AC.
      - PE2 will always set the CW L-bit to 0 when sending a frame on 
        the PW and ignore the CW L-bit when receiving a frame from the 
        PW. Actually PE2 has no concept of CW L-bit but just treat it 
        as bit 4, one of the reserved bits for future use.

Internet Draft         Framework E-Tree over MPLS             March 2010


1. Introduction 

1.1. Objective and Scope

   This document proposes a solution framework for supporting Metro 
   Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) services over a MPLS 
   network. The objective is to provide a simple and effective approach 
   to emulate E-Tree services in addition to Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) 
   services on an existing MPLS network.

   This solution framework makes use of existing IETF specified 
   mechanisms unless there are technical reasons why the existing 
   mechanisms are insufficient or unnecessary.

   This document does not intend to provide a full specification of the 
   solution, but rather to identify the functional components of the 
   overall solution, and for each component, whether it is REQUIRED or 
   OPTIONAL, whether existing mechanism is sufficient, or whether 
   relevant mechanism is already under development.

   In this document, "current standard" refers to [RFC4385], [RFC4447], 
   [RFC4448], [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].

1.2. Traditional Ethernet Network

   In this document, traditional Ethernet network refers to the Ethernet 
   bridge/switch network, not the Ethernet repeater/hub network.

   Data frame is Ethernet frame.

   Data forwarding is MAC-based forwarding, which includes MAC address 
   learning and aging.

   It is important to note that in traditional Ethernet network unicast 
   unknown, multicast and broadcast frames are forwarded in exactly the 
   same way to every port except the ingress port.

   An Ethernet host receiving a frame checks the destination address in 
   the frame to decide whether it is the intended destination. 

1.3. MEF Multipoint Ethernet Services

   MEF defines two multipoint Ethernet Service types:
     - E-LAN (Ethernet LAN), multipoint-to-multipoint service
     - E-Tree (Ethernet Tree), rooted-multipoint service

Internet Draft         Framework E-Tree over MPLS             March 2010


   According to MEF's technical specification, a generic E-LAN/E-Tree 
   service is always bidirectional in the sense that ingress frames can 
   originate at any endpoint in the service. However, some application 
   scenarios of E-Tree may have unidirectional traffic only. Section 3 
   will discuss about different use cases.

   For full specification, please refer to MEF's "Ethernet Services 
   Definitions - Phase 2" [MEF6.1] and "Ethernet Services Attributes 
   Phase 2" [MEF10.2].

1.3.1. Similarity between E-LAN and E-Tree

   Data frame MUST be Ethernet frame.

   Data forwarding can be MAC-based forwarding or something else, to be 
   specified by service provider in the particular service definition.

   Extract from [MEF6.1] Table 7 and Table 9:
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | EVC Service   | E-LAN/E-Tree Service Type Requirement             |
   | Attribute     |                                                   |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | Unicast       | Deliver Unconditionally or Deliver Conditionally. |
   | Service Frame | If Delivered Conditionally, MUST specify the      |
   | Delivery      | delivery criteria.                                |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | Multicast     | Deliver Unconditionally or Deliver Conditionally. |
   | Service Frame | If Delivered Conditionally, MUST specify the      |
   | Delivery      | delivery criteria.                                |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | Broadcast     | Deliver Unconditionally or Deliver Conditionally. |
   | Service Frame | If Delivered Conditionally, MUST specify the      |
   | Delivery      | delivery criteria.                                |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+

   It is important to note that it is not a must for a MEF multipoint 
   Ethernet service (E-LAN or E-Tree) to use MAC-based forwarding. This 
   document presents a solution framework for MAC-based forwarding 
   E-Tree in section 5, and also discusses non-MAC-based forwarding 
   E-Tree in section 6.

1.3.2. Difference between E-LAN and E-Tree

   Within the context of a multipoint Ethernet service, each endpoint is 
   designated as either a Root or a Leaf. A Root can communicate with 
   all other endpoints in the same multipoint Ethernet service, however 
   a Leaf can only communicate with Roots but not Leafs.

Internet Draft         Framework E-Tree over MPLS             March 2010


   The only difference between E-LAN and E-Tree is:
     - E-LAN has Root endpoints only, which implies there is no 
       communication restriction between endpoints 
     - E-Tree has both Root and Leaf endpoints, which implies there is a 
       need to enforce communication restriction between Leaf endpoints

   Extract from [MEF10.2] Section 6.3:
   The UNI Type MUST have the value either "Root" or "Leaf." If the type 
   of EVC is Point-to-Point or Multipoint-to-Multipoint, then the UNI 
   Type MUST equal "Root."

   Extract from [MEF10.2] Section 6.1.2.2:
   An ingress Service Frame mapped to the EVC at a Leaf UNI MUST NOT 
   result in an egress Service Frame at another Leaf UNI but MAY result 
   in an egress Service Frame at some or all of the Root UNIs.

   It is important to note that one E-Tree service may have single or 
   multiple Root UNIs.

   Extract from [MEF6.1] Section 6.3:
   In its simplest form, an E-Tree Service type can provide a single 
   Root for multiple Leaf UNIs. Each Leaf UNI can exchange data with 
   only the Root UNI. ... In more sophisticated forms, an E-Tree Service 
   type may support two or more Root UNIs. In this scenario, each Leaf 
   UNI can exchange data only with the Root UNIs. As well, the Roots can 
   communicate with each other. In such a service, redundant access to 
   the Root can also be provided, effectively allowing for enhanced 
   service reliability and flexibility.

1.4. IETF Multipoint L2VPN Services

1.4.1. Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)

   VPLS is a L2VPN service that provides multipoint-to-multipoint 
   connectivity for Ethernet across an IP or MPLS-enabled IP Packet 
   Switched Network. VPLS emulates the Ethernet VLAN functionality of 
   traditional Ethernet network.

   VPLS is a current IETF standard, please refer to [RFC4761] [RFC4762].

   Data frame is Ethernet frame. 

   Data forwarding is MAC-based forwarding, which includes MAC address 
   learning and aging.

Internet Draft         Framework E-Tree over MPLS             March 2010


   It is important to note that the current standard VPLS treats 
   Ethernet multicast frame in exactly the same way as Ethernet 
   broadcast frame and does not restrict transmission of Ethernet 
   multicast frame to a smaller set of receivers. An Ethernet host 
   receiving a frame checks the destination address in the frame to 
   determine whether it is the intended destination.

   VPLS can be used to emulate E-LAN service over MPLS network provided 
   that the E-LAN service uses MAC-based forwarding as service frame 
   delivery attribute. Considerable number of service providers have 
   adopted this approach to provide E-LAN services to customers.

1.4.2. Virtual Private Multicast Service (VPMS)

   VPMS is a L2VPN service that provides point-to-multipoint 
   connectivity across a variety of link layers, including Frame Relay, 
   ATM, Ethernet, PPP, etc., across an IP or MPLS-enabled IP Packet 
   Switched Network.

   In the Ethernet use case, VPMS provides single coverage of receiver 
   membership, i.e. there is no distinct differentiation for multiple 
   multicast groups. Destination address in Ethernet frame is not used 
   in data forwarding.

   VPMS MUST support unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic from a 
   sender to multiple receivers and MAY support reverse traffic in a 
   point-to-point manner.

   VPMS is currently under development. Please refer to [Draft VPMS 
   Frmwk].

1.5. Terminology

   E-Tree

   An Ethernet VPN in which each Root AC can communicate with every 
   other AC, whereas Leaf ACs can only communicate with Root ACs. Each 
   AC on an E-Tree construct is designated as either a Root AC or a Leaf 
   AC. There can be multiple Root ACs and Leaf ACs per E-Tree construct.

   Root AC

   An ingress frame at a Root AC can be delivered to one or more of 
   any of the other ACs in the E-Tree. Please note that this AC is 
   bidirectional.

Internet Draft         Framework E-Tree over MPLS             March 2010


   Leaf AC

   Ingress frame at a Leaf AC can only be delivered to one or more Root
   ACs in the E-Tree. Ingress frame at a Leaf AC MUST NOT be delivered
   to any Leaf ACs in the E-Tree. Please note that this AC is 
   bidirectional.

2. Reference Model

   Figure 1 below describes a generic reference model where PE1, PE2 and 
   PE3 need to establish an E-Tree construct between different Ethernet 
   endpoints. Each PE has 2 Root ACs and 2 Leaf ACs connected to a VSI. 
   These VSIs are then linked together via Ethernet PWs.

   In most use cases, an E-Tree construct has only a few Root ACs but 
   many Leaf ACs. There may be only Root ACs or only Leaf ACs on a PE.

   With an E-Tree construct:
     - A Root AC can receive from and transmit to any other ACs.
     - A Leaf AC can receive from and transmit to any Root ACs.
     - A Leaf AC cannot receive from and transmit to any other Leaf ACs.

   This applies to all traffic, including Unicast Known, Unicast 
   Unknown, Broadcast and Multicast.  
 
   When an Ethernet Frame is received on PE1 via AC1, the frame can be 
   transmitted to any other local ACs on PE1 and via Ethernet PWs to any 
   remote ACs on PE2 and PE3.

   However when an Ethernet frame is received on PE1 via AC3, the frame 
   can be transmitted to any other local Root ACs on PE1 and via 
   Ethernet PWs to any remote Root ACs on PE2 and PE3, but the frame 
   cannot be transmitted to any local Leaf ACs on PE1 nor any remote 
   Leaf ACs on PE2 and PE3.

                     Table 1: E-Tree Use cases

   Common to all use cases, direct Leaf-to-Leaf communication is not 
   required. For Mobile backhaul, this may not be valid for LTE X2 
   interfaces in the future.

   If direct Leaf-to-Leaf communication is not allowed due to security 
   concern, then E-Tree should be used to prohibit communication between 
   Leaf endpoints, otherwise E-LAN is also a feasible option.

   Also common to the use cases mentioned above, there may be single or 
   multiple Root endpoints in one E-Tree service. The need for multiple 
   Root endpoints is usually driven by redundancy requirement. Whether 
   a particular E-Tree service needs to support single or multiple Root 
   endpoints depends on the target application.

Internet Draft         Framework E-Tree over MPLS             March 2010


   A generic E-Tree service supports the following traffic flows: 
     - Unicast bidirectional Root to/from Root
     - Unicast bidirectional Root to/from Leaf
     - Broadcast/Multicast unidirectional Root to all Roots and Leafs
     - Broadcast/Multicast unidirectional Leaf to all Roots
   A particular E-Tree service may need to support all the above or only 
   a subset depending on the target application.

   Among the use cases mentioned above, broadcast video draws most 
   attention. Actually, broadcast video is a representing example for 
   content delivery in general, such as news feed, financial data 
   feed, etc.

4. Challenges

4.1. Generic E-Tree Service Definition

   This section highlights why the current standard VPLS is insufficient 
   for emulating E-Tree service over MPLS network.

4.1.1. Mandatory Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction

   Current standard VPLS treats all ACs equal (i.e. not classified into 
   Root or Leaf) and provides any-to-any connectivity among all ACs. The 
   current standard VPLS does not include any mechanism of communication 
   restriction between specific ACs, therefore is insufficient for 
   emulating generic E-Tree service over MPLS network.

   In order to fulfil the generic E-Tree service definition, extensions 
   to the current VPLS standard and related PWE3 standard are required. 
   Such extensions should have minimal impact on the emulated E-LAN 
   services already in operation.

4.2. Use Case Desirable Requirements

   There are quite a variety of use cases for E-Tree. For some use 
   cases, the generic MEF E-Tree service definition is good enough. For 
   some other use cases, there are desirable requirements beyond that.

   The challenges discussed in this section are not related to the 
   generic MEF E-Tree service definition but the desirable requirements
   of specific use cases. They may be critical to the success in some
   E-Tree services while totally irrelevant in some others.

4.2.1. Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast Optimisation

   According to MAC-based forwarding, an Ethernet broadcast/multicast/
   unicast unknown frame is forwarded to all ACs other than the ingress
   AC, which implies point-to-multipoint traffic from the ingress PE to
   all other PEs in the VPLS instance.

   The current standard VPLS uses only point-to-point PW between PEs.
   When the Ethernet destination address is broadcast, multicast or
   unicast unknown, the ingress PE replicates the frame on every PW
   towards remote PE belonging to the same VPLS instance. Depending on
   the mapping between the logical topology of the E-Tree service and
   the physical topology of the network, multiple PWs may transverse
   same physical link, result in multiple copies of the same payload
   Ethernet frame on the physical link. Such approach is inefficient in
   terms of bandwidth usage.

Internet Draft         Framework E-Tree over MPLS             March 2010


   For some use cases, for example broadcast/multicast video, due to 
   nature of the application, there is significant volume of point-to- 
   multipoint traffic. Bandwidth optimisation for such traffic within 
   the network becomes a concern from the service provider perspective.

   [RFC5501] provides an in-depth discussion on broadcast/multicast
   related requirements for VPLS, see issue B (Replication of PWs on
   shared physical path) in section 3.2.

4.2.2. IP Multicast Optimisation

   The current standard VPLS is a L2VPN service agnostic to customer's
   Layer 3 traffic, hence does not maintain any information about IP
   multicast group membership. Although a Layer 3 IP multicast packet is
   encapsulated in a Layer 2 Ethernet multicast frame, the current
   standard VPLS treats Ethernet multicast frame in exactly the same way
   as Ethernet broadcast frame. Therefore, such payload IP multicast
   packet will be forwarded to every other AC of the same VPLS instance.

   A payload IP multicast packet will be forwarded to all ACs, including
   those with no member of the specific IP multicast group attached.
   Unnecessary traffic consumes bandwidth on access link and may become
   a concern from the customer perspective. In some cases, it may also
   be a security concern as the multicast frame may be forwarded to an
   endpoint other than the intended destinations.

   A payload IP multicast packet will be forwarded to a remote PE with 
   no member of the specific IP multicast group attached. Unnecessary
   traffic consumes bandwidth in the network and may become a concern
   from the service provider perspective.  

   For some use cases, for example multicast video, due to nature of the
   application, there is significant volume of IP multicast traffic and
   different IP multicast groups are required in one E-Tree service. The
   above may become a real concern from both the customer and service 
   provider perspectives.

   [RFC5501] provides an in-depth discussion on broadcast/multicast
   related requirements for VPLS, see both issue A (Replication to non-
   member site) and issue B (Replication of PWs on shared physical path)
   in section 3.2.

4.2.3. MAC-based Forwarding Unnecessary 

   For some use cases, for example broadcast video, due to nature of the 
   application, there is only broadcast unidirectional traffic from Root 
   to all other endpoints. It is unnecessary to use destination address 
   for data forwarding. Deliver unconditionally for ingress frame at 
   Root endpoint may be a simpler approach than MAC-based forwarding.

Internet Draft         Framework E-Tree over MPLS             March 2010


4.2.4. MAC-based Forwarding Security Concern

   MAC-based forwarding will make an unicast frame from a Root destined 
   for a specific Leaf being forwarded to other endpoints in addition to 
   the intended destination when the frame is classified as unicast 
   unknown, may be due to MAC address aged out or MAC address table 
   overflow.

   MAC address spoofing may cause an unicast frame from a Root destined 
   for a specific Leaf being forwarded to an endpoint different from the 
   intended destination.

   If such unicast frame carries sensitive information strictly for the 
   intended destination only, then the MAC-based forwarding may cause a 
   security concern from the customer perspective.

   For some use cases where mutually un-trusted subscribers are 
   connected to leaf endpoints in the same E-Tree service, such as
   Internet access and wholesale access, this is a valid concern.

   There are some possible mitigations:
     - For every Leaf endpoint of the particular E-Tree service, deploy 
       a service provider controlled router between the Leaf endpoint 
       and the customer network
     - Customer to deploy encryption for sensitive information, for
       example IPsec, SSL, SSH, HTTPS

   Whether the MAC-based forwarding really becomes a security concern
   depends on the particular application and the deployment scenario.
   This is unlikely to be a critical concern in most cases.

5. A Solution Framework for MAC-based Forwarding E-Tree

   As mentioned in section 1.3.1. E-Tree can use MAC-based forwarding or 
   something else for data forwarding. This section presents a solution 
   framework for MAC-based forwarding E-Tree. Section 6 will discuss 
   other variants.

   This is a VPLS-based solution. Functional components of the solution 
   are identified and discussed in the subsections.  

5.1. MAC-based Forwarding Any-to-Any Ethernet VPN

   This is a REQUIRED component.

   This component is the current standard VPLS and PWE3 as specified in 
   [RFC4385] [RFC4447] [RFC4448] [RFC4761] [RFC4762], which provides 
   any-to-any connectivity among all ACs in one VPLS instance.

   This is the base component. All other REQUIRED/OPTIONAL components 
   are to be added on top of this component.

5.2. Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction

   This is a REQUIRED component.

   This component is a minimal extension to the current VPLS and PWE3 
   standards, with the objective to provide a simple and effective way 
   to support E-Tree services in addition to E-LAN services using VPLS 
   on a MPLS network.

5.2.1. Per-payload Signaling on PW - From Leaf or Root

   Let's look at the scenario illustrated in Figure 2 below. VPLS is 
   used to emulate an E-Tree service over a MPLS network.

   Figure 2: Reference Model for Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction

   When PE2 receives a frame from PE1 via the PW, 
     - PE2 does not know which AC on PE1 is the ingress AC
     - PE2 does not know whether the ingress AC is a Leaf AC or not
     - PE2 does not have sufficient information to enforce the 
       Leaf-to-Leaf communication restriction

   A simple fix is to carry additional one bit of information (0 or 1) 
   for each payload Ethernet frame on the Ethernet PW
     - Indicate whether the frame is from a Leaf AC on ingress PE or not 
     - Based on this one bit of information, egress PE can decide 
       whether the frame can be forwarded to a local Leaf AC or not 

   Extension to current PWE3 standard [RFC4448] is proposed. The work in 
   progress [Draft CW L-bit] provides a precise specification on how to 
   use a specific bit within the Control Word, refer as "CW L-bit" to 
   indicate whether the payload Ethernet frame comes from a Root AC or a 
   Leaf AC.

   There are other possible ways to get around this problem. Some do not
   require any extension to current PWE3 standard. Unfortunately they
   all come with significant design complexity and/or deployment
   constraints and hence not recommended as solution for the generic 
   E-Tree service definition. Appendix A highlights the major ones and
   the related concerns.

5.2.2. Extension to VPLS

   Extension to current VPLS standard [RFC4761] [RFC4762] is proposed. 
   The work in progress [Draft VPLS ETree] provides a precise 
   specification on how to enforce the Leaf-to-Leaf communication 
   restriction locally on a PE.

   The [Draft VPLS ETree] introduces the following:
     - AC Type, either Root or Leaf
     - Use of Control Word to carry the "CW L-bit"
     - Additional "Set CW L-bit" action and "Forward or Drop" decision 
       in data forwarding

   It is important to note that the "Set CW L-bit" action and "Forward 
   or Drop" decision specified in [Draft VPLS ETree] are in addition to 
   and performed after the following
     - MAC-based forwarding decision as per current standard
     - Loop free VPLS "split horizon" rule (MUST NOT forward traffic 
       from one PW to another PW in the same VPLS mesh) as per current 
       standard

5.3. Optional Enhancement - Point-to-Multipoint PW

   This is in response to the challenge in section 4.2.1. Ethernet
   Broadcast/Multicast Optimisation. 

   This is an OPTIONAL component, applicable only when there is 
   significant volume of Ethernet broadcast/multicast traffic.

   Point-to-Multipoint pseudowire (P2MP PW) is a PW attached to a source 
   used to distribute Layer 1 or Layer 2 format traffic to a set of 
   receivers. P2MP PW is unidirectional but optionally bidirectional.

   By using P2MP PW, the ingress PE is not responsible for replicating 
   the payload frame on each P2P PW towards egress PE, instead the 
   network elements along the physical path participate in replication. 
   The replication is done by the underlying point-to-multipoint label 
   switched path (P2MP LSP).

   Extension to current VPLS standard will be required to specify how 
   P2MP PW and P2P PW should be used and how MAC learning works on P2MP 
   PW.

   P2MP PW is currently under development. Please refer to [Draft P2MP 
   PW Req] [Draft P2MP PW Sig].

   It is important to note that this component will align with the
   recommendation in [RFC4665],
   "With the exception of IPLS, an L2VPN service SHOULD be agnostic to
   customer's Layer 3 traffic (e.g., IP, IPX, Appletalk) encapsulated
   within Layer 2 frames."

5.4. Optional Enhancement - IP Multicast in VPLS

   This is in response to the challenge in section 4.2.2. IP Multicast
   Optimisation.

   This is an OPTIONAL component, applicable only when there is 
   significant volume of IP multicast traffic and different IP multicast
   groups are required in one E-Tree service.

   Multicast in VPLS is currently under development, with the objective
   to provide efficient ways to support IP multicast services over VPLS.
   It covers IP multicast group membership control and also bandwidth
   optimisation. Please refer to [Draft Mcast VPLS].

   It is important to note that this component will make use of Layer 3
   IP multicast information in payload frames to improve transport
   efficiency, hence will not align with the recommendation in [RFC4665]
   that an L2VPN service SHOULD be agnostic to customer's Layer 3
   traffic.

6. Non MAC-based Forwarding E-Tree

   This section presents some variants of E-Tree services which do not 
   use MAC-based forwarding as the service frame delivery attribute.

6.1. Single Root, Broadcast Only - VPMS

   This is in response to the challenge in section 4.2.3. MAC-based 
   Forwarding Unnecessary.

   VPMS provides single coverage of receiver membership. Destination 
   address in Ethernet frame is not used in data forwarding.

   For E-Tree service of single Root and only unidirectional broadcast 
   traffic from the Root, for example certain broadcast video or similar 
   content delivery applications, VPMS will be a much more simple and 
   effective solution than VPLS.

   VPMS is currently under development. Please refer to [Draft VPMS 
   Frmwk].

6.2. Multiple Roots, Broadcast and Unicast

   This is in response to the challenge in section 4.2.4. MAC-based 
   Forwarding Security Concern.

Appendix A. Other Possible Ways for Leaf-to-Leaf Communication
            Restriction 

   This appendix briefly describes the following approaches:
   - Single Root Only (A.1)
   - Only one PE has Roots (A.2)
   - Only one PE with both Root & Leaf
     - Backhaul Root (A.3)
     - Backhaul Leaf (A.4)
     - H-VPLS Root (A.5)
     - H-VPLS Leaf (A.6)
   - Separate PEs for Root and Leaf (A.7)
   - Separate VSI for Root and Leaf
     - Internal Connection (A.8)
     - External Connection (A.9)
   - Separate PWs for "From Root" traffic and "From Leaf" traffic (A.10)
   - "From Root" or "From Leaf" derived from source MAC address (A.11)
   - Static MAC address configuration for Root AC (A.12)

   For the diagrams in this appendix, "L" indicates the particular AC or
   PW belonging to the PE local split horizon group specifically for
   Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction. No communication is allowed
   between any two members of a split horizon group.

   Concerns:
   - More PW
   - Most, if not all, vendor implementation support only one PW
     between two VSIs on different PEs
   - Most, if not all, vendor implementation of service-aware management
     system assume only one PW between two VSIs on different PEs
   - Asymmetric path for bidirectional traffic between Root and Leaf on
     different PEs (e.g. CE01-->CE07 use the "From Root" PW, CE07-->CE01
     use the "From Leaf" PW)
   - Require extension to current standard VPLS
     - support two PWs between two VSIs on different PEs (both active
       but no loop)
     - share MAC learning between the "From Root" PW and "From Leaf" PW
       (bidirectional traffic may be on asymmetric path)
     - in addition to standard MAC-based forwarding, select which PW to
       use based on whether ingress AC is Root or Leaf
     - filter Leaf-to-Leaf traffic (split horizon group at PW/AC level
       is not good enough because of asymmetric path)

A.11. "From Root" or "From Leaf" derived from source MAC address

   Based on the current standard VPLS, a PE has no information about ACs
   on another PE.

   This approach will need additional information exchange between
   ingress PE and egress PE, via OSS or peer to peer.

   Concerns:
   - Require system development or additional signaling between PEs
   - Not an ideal solution from security perspective because of the
     dynamic nature of MAC address to AC mapping


A.12. Static MAC address configuration for Root AC

   This approach requires additional configuration on PEs
   - Disable MAC address learning for Root ACs
   - Static configuration of MAC addresses per Root AC
   - Add filtering for each Root AC
     - Drop ingress frame if source MAC address not equal to any of the
       static MAC addresses configured for the particular Root AC
   - Add filtering for each Leaf AC
     - Drop ingress frame if source MAC address equal to any of the
       static MAC addresses configured for any Root ACs of the VPLS
       instance
     - Drop egress frame if source MAC address not equal to any of the
       static MAC addresses configured for any Root ACs of the VPLS
       instance

   Concerns:
   - No MAC address learning capability for Root ACs
   - Need resources for maintaining the static MAC address configuration
     per Root AC

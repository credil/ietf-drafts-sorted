Abstract

   A long long time ago DES was standardized.  Some 30 years later
   (2003) is was withdrawn as a standard by NIST, today 6 years later,
   its time for DES to finally die.  By 2008 it was possible to brute
   force DES keys in 6.4 days using less than USD 10k worth of hardware.
   So by 2008 DES had passed its sell-by date.  Use in Kerberos should
   therefore stop.

2.  Background

   Kerberos 5 was defined in [RFC1510] and updated in [RFC4120], the
   Kerberos crypto system is defined by [RFC3961] and includes support
   for DES encryption types.  This document move all of the DES
   encryption and related checksum types to historic.

   DES was withdrawn in [DES-Transition-Plan] by NIST.  IETF have also
   published its the position in [RFC4772], which in the recommendation
   summery is made very clear: "don't use DES".

   In Kerberos GSS-API mechanism [RFC1964] and the updated version
   [RFC4121] the following checksum and encryption mechanism is defined:
   three SGN ALG: 0000 - DES MAC MD5, 0100 - MD2.5 0200 - DES MAC and
   one SEAL ALG 0000 - DES.  With newer encryption types for Kerberos
   defined in [RFC4121], Microsofts ARCFOUR4-HMAC based GSS-API mech,
   and MITs DES3 , there is no need to support the old DES based SGN/
   SEAL types.

3.  Recommendations

   This document removes the mandatory-to-implement types from
   [RFC4120]: Encryption: DES-CBC-MD5(3)

   This document removes the mandatory-to-implement types from [RFC4120]
   when used in conjunction with DES-CBC-MD5: Checksums: DES-MD5(7)

   Kerberos implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT implement the
   single DES encryption types: DES-CBC-CRC(1), DES-CBC-MD4(2), DES-CBC-
   MD5(3).

   Kerberos implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT implement the
   checksum type: CRC32(1), RSA-MD4(2), RSA-MD4-DES(3), DES-MAC(4), DES-
   MAC-K(5), RSA-MD4-MAC-K(6), DES-MD5(7), RSA-MD5-DES(8).

   Note that RSA-MD5 might be with non-DES encryption types, for
   example, when doing a TGS-REQ with a ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5 some client
   uses RSA-MD5 for the checksum that is stored inside the encrypted
   part of the authenticator.  This use of RSA-MD5 should probably be
   considered safe, so the Kerberos implementation should make sure this
   usage is not disabled when used with legacy system that can't handle
   newer checksum types.

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement the SGN ALG: DES MAC MD5(0000), MD2.5(0100), DES MAC(0200).

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement the SEAL ALG: DES(0000).

5.  Security Considerations

   Removing support for single DES improves security since DES is
   considered to be insecure.

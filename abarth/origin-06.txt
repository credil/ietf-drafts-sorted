Internet-Draft           The Web Origin Concept            November 2009


Abstract

   This document defines the concept of an "origin," which is used by
   web browsers to isolate content retrieved from different parties.
   The origin concept is defined by a "same-origin" relation and a
   serialization algorithm.  This document also defines an HTTP Origin
   header, which a user agent can use to describe the security contexts
   that caused the user agent to initiate an HTTP request.  HTTP servers
   can use the Origin header to mitigate against Cross-Site Request
   Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the concept of an "origin," which is used by
   web browsers to isolate content retrieved from different parties.
   The origin concept is defined by a "same-origin" relation and a
   serialization algorithm.  This document also defines an HTTP Origin
   header, which a user agent can use to describe the security contexts
   that caused the user agent to initiate an HTTP request.  HTTP servers
   can use the Origin header to mitigate against Cross-Site Request
   Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

   TODO: Discuss other CSRF defenses.

2.  Origin

   The following algorithm MUST be used to compute the origin of a URI.

   1.   Let /uri/ be the URI for which the origin is being determined.

   2.   Parse /uri/.

   3.   If /uri/ does not use a server-based naming authority, or if
        parsing /uri/ failed, or if /uri/ is not an absolute URI, then
        return an implementation-defined value.

   4.   Let /scheme/ be the scheme component of /uri/, converted to
        lowercase.

   5.   If the implementation doesn't support the protocol given by
        /scheme/, then return an implementation-defined value.

   6.   If /scheme/ is "file", then the implementation MAY return a
        implementation-defined value.

   7.   Let /host/ be the host component of /uri/.

   8.   Apply the IDNA ToASCII algorithm [RFC3490] to /host/, with both
        the AllowUnassigned and UseSTD3ASCIIRules flags set.  Let /host/
        be the result of the ToASCII algorithm.

   9.   If ToASCII fails to convert one of the components of the string
        (e.g. because it is too long or because it contains invalid
        characters), then return an implementation-defined value.

   10.  Let /host/ be the result of converting /host/ to lowercase.

   11.  If there is no port component of /uri/, then let /port/ be the
        default port for the protocol given by /scheme/.  Otherwise, let
        /port/ be the port component of /uri/.

   12.  Return the tuple (/scheme/, /host/, /port/).

   Implementations MAY define other types of origins in addition to the
   scheme/host/port tuple type defined above.  (For example, user agents
   could implement globally unique origins or certificate-based
   origins.)

3.  Comparing Origins

   Implementations MUST use the following algorithm to test whether two
   origins are the "same origin".

   1.  Let /A/ be the first origin being compared, and let /B/ be the
       second origin being compared.

   2.  If either /A/ or /B/ is not a scheme/host/port tuple, return an
       implementation-defined value.

   3.  If /A/ and /B/ have scheme components that are not identical,
       return false.

   4.  If /A/ and /B/ have host components that are not identical,
       return false.

   5.  If /A/ and /B/ have port components that are not identical,
       return false.

   6.  Return true.

4.  Serializing Origins

4.1.  Unicode Serialization of an Origin

   Implementations MUST using the following algorithm to compute the
   Unicode serialization of an origin:

   1.  If the origin in question is not a scheme/host/port tuple, then
       return the string

          null

       (i.e., the code point sequence U+006E, U+0075, U+006C, U+006C)
       and abort these steps.

   2.  Otherwise, let /result/ be the scheme part of the origin tuple.

   3.  Append the string "://" to /result/.

   4.  Apply the IDNA ToUnicode algorithm [RFC3490] to each component of
       the host part of the origin tuple, and append the results of each
       component, in the same order, separated by U+002E FULL STOP code
       points (".") to /result/.

   5.  If the port part of the origin tuple gives a port that is
       different from the default port for the protocol given by the
       scheme part of the origin tuple, then append a U+003A COLON code
       points (":") and the given port, in base ten, to /result/.

   6.  Return /result/.

   TODO: Check that we handle IPv6 literals correctly.

4.2.  ASCII Serialization of an Origin

   Implementations MUST using the following algorithm to compute the
   ASCII serialization of an origin:

   1.  If the origin in question is not a scheme/host/port tuple, then
       return the string

          null

       (i.e., the code point sequence U+006E, U+0075, U+006C, U+006C)
       and abort these steps.

   2.  Otherwise, let /result/ be the scheme part of the origin tuple.

   3.  Append the string "://" to /result/.

   4.  If the host part of the origin tuple is in the form of a DNS
       domain name, apply the IDNA conversion algorithm ([RFC3490]
       section 4) to it, with both the AllowUnassigned and
       UseSTD3ASCIIRules flags set, employ the ToASCII operation, and
       append the result to /result/.

   5.  If ToASCII fails to convert one of the components of the string,
       e.g. because it is too long or because it contains invalid
       characters, then return the literal string "null" and abort these
       steps.

   6.  If the port part of the origin tuple gives a port that is
       different from the default port for the protocol given by the
       scheme part of the origin tuple, then append a U+003A COLON code
       point (":") and the given port, in base ten, to /result/.

   7.  Return /result/.

5.  User Agent Behavior

   Whenever a user agent issues an HTTP request, the user agent MUST
   include exactly one HTTP header named "Origin" that conforms to the
   following ABNF [RFC5234] grammar:

     origin              = "origin" ":" origin-list-or-null
     origin-list-or-null = OWS [ "null" / origin-list ] OWS
     origin-list         = serialized-origin *( SP serialized-origin )
     serialized-origin   = scheme "://" host [ ":" port ]
      ; <scheme>, <host>, <port> productions from RFC3986

   Whenever a user agent would send a Origin header containing two
   consecutive, identical origin serializations, the user agent MUST
   remove one such origin serialization from the header.

   Whenever a user agent issues an HTTP request from a "privacy-
   sensitive" context, the user agent MUST send the value "null" in the
   Origin header.

   If /B/ is the Request-URI in the Request-Line of an HTTP request,
   then the associated HTTP response is an "HTTP redirect from URI /B/"
   if the response contains a 3xx Status Code (all terms RFC2616).

   Whenever a user agent issues an HTTP request to URI /A/ as a result
   of an HTTP redirect from URI /B/, the user agent MUST either:

   1.  set the value of the Origin header in the HTTP request to /A/ to
       "null" (i.e., the code point sequence U+006E, U+0075, U+006C,
       U+006C),

   2.  set the value of the Origin header in the /A/ request to the
       value of the Origin header in the /B/ request extended with a
       space and the ASCII serialization of the origin of /B/, unless
       this would result in the header containing the origin
       serialization "null" in a component.

   Whenever a user agent issues an HTTP request that (1) is *not* the
   result of an HTTP redirect and (2) is *not* initiated from a
   "privacy-sensitive" context, the user agent SHOULD set the value of
   the Origin header to the ASCII serialization of the origin that
   initiated the HTTP request.

   Note: This behavior differs from that of the HTTP Referer header,
   which user agents often suppress when an origin with an "https"
   scheme issues a request for a URI with an "http" scheme.

6.  HTTP Server Behavior

   HTTP Servers MAY use the Origin header to "defend themselves against
   CSRF attacks."  Such servers are known as "participating servers" in
   this section.

   Let the /origin white list/ of a participating server be a set of
   strings selected by the operator of that server.

   The string "null" MUST NOT be a member of the /origin white list/ for
   any participating server.

      Example: The origin white list for the example.com Web server
      could be the strings "http://example.com", "https://example.com",
      "http://www.example.com", and "https://www.example.com".

   A participating server MUST use the following algorithm when
   determining whether to modify state in response to an HTTP request:

   1.  If the request method is safe (as defined by RFC 2616, Section
       9.1.1, e.g. either "GET" nor "HEAD"), return "MUST NOT modify
       state" and abort these steps.

   2.  If the request does not contain a header named "Origin", return
       "MAY modify state" abort these steps.

   3.  For each request header named "Origin", let the /initiating
       origin list/ be the list of origins represented in the header:

       1.  If there exists a origin in the /initiating origin list/ is
           not a member of the /origin white list/ for this server,
           return "MUST NOT modify state" and abort these steps.

   4.  Return "MAY modify state".

      Example: A Web server could modify state in response to POST
      requests that lack an Origin header (because these requests are
      sent by non-supporting user agents) and could modify state in
      response to POST requests that have an Origin header of
      "http://example.com", "https://example.com",
      "http://www.example.com", or "https://www.example.com".

7.  Privacy Considerations

   This section is not normative.

   The Origin header improves on the Referer header by respecting the
   user's privacy: The Origin header includes only the information
   required to identify the principal that initiated the request
   (typically the scheme, host, and port of initiating origin).  In
   particular, the Origin header does not contain the path or query
   portions of the URI included in the Referer header that invade
   privacy without providing additional security.

   The Origin header also improves on the Referer header by not leaking
   intranet host names to external web sites when a user follows a
   hyperlink from an intranet host to an external site because
   hyperlinks generate privacy-sensitive requests.

Internet-Draft           The Web Origin Concept            November 2009


8.  Security Considerations

   This section is not normative.

   Because a supporting user agent will always include the Origin header
   when making HTTP requests, HTTP servers can detect that a request was
   initiated by a supporting user agent by observing the presence of the
   header.  This design prevents a malicious web site from making a
   supporting user agent appear to be a non-supporting user agent.
   Unlike the Referer header, which is absent when suppressed by the
   user agent, the Origin header takes on the value "null" when
   suppressed by the user agent.

   In some legacy user agents, The Origin header can be spoofed for
   same-site XMLHttpRequests.  Sites that rely only on network
   connectivity for authentication should use a DNS rebinding defense,
   such as validating the HTTP Host header, in addition to CSRF
   protection.

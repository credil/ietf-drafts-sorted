Internet-Draft        Content-Type Processing Model       September 2009


Abstract

   Many web servers supply incorrect Content-Type headers with their
   HTTP responses.  In order to be compatible with these servers, user
   agents consider the content of HTTP responses as well as the Content-
   Type header when determining the effective media type of the
   response.  This document describes an algorithm for determining the
   effective media type of HTTP responses that balances security and
   compatibility considerations.

Internet-Draft        Content-Type Processing Model       September 2009


1.  Introduction

   The HTTP Content-Type header indicates the media type of an HTTP
   response.  However, many HTTP servers supply a Content-Type that does
   not match the actual contents of the response.  Historically, web
   browsers have been tolerated these servers by examining the content
   of HTTP responses in addition to the Content-Type header to determine
   the effective media type of the response.

   Without a clear specification of how to "sniff" the media type, each
   user agent implementor was forced to reverse engineer the behavior of
   the other user agents and to developed their own algorithm.  These
   divergent algorithms have lead to a lack of interoperability between
   user agents and to security issues when the server intends an HTTP
   response to be interpreted as one media type but some user agents
   interpret the responses as another media type.

   These security issues are most severe when an "honest" server lets
   potentially malicious users upload files and then serves the contents
   of those files with a low-privilege media type (such as text/plain or
   image/jpeg).  (Malicious servers, of course, can specify an arbitrary
   media type in the Content-Type header.)  In the absense of mime
   sniffing, this user-generated content would not be interpreted as a
   high-privilege media type, such as text/html.  However, if a user
   agent does interpret a low-privilege media type, such as image/gif,
   as a high-privilege media type, such as text/html, the user agent as
   created a privilege escalation vulnerability in the server.  For
   example, a malicious user might be able to leverage content sniffing
   to mount a cross-site script attack by including JavaScript code in
   the uploaded file that a user agent treats as text/html.

   This document describes a content sniffing algorithm that carefully
   balances the compatibility needs of user agent implementors with the
   security constraints.  The algorithm has been constructed with
   reference to content sniffing algorithms present in popular user
   agents, an extensive database of existing web content, and metrics
   collected from implementations deployed to a sizable number of users
   [BarthCaballeroSong2009].

   WARNING!  Whenever possible, user agents should avoid employing a
   content sniffing algorithm.  However, if a user agent does employ a
   content sniffing algorithm, the user agent should use the algorithm
   in this document exactly because using a different content sniffing
   algorithm than servers expect causes security problems.  For example,
   if a server believes that the client will treat a contributed file as
   an image (and thus treat it as benign), but a user agent believes the
   content to be HTML (and thus privileged to execute any scripts
   contained therein), an attacker might be able to steal the user's

2.  Metadata

   The explicit Content-Type metadata associated with the resource (the
   resource's type information) depends on the protocol that was used to
   fetch the resource.

   For HTTP resources, only the last Content-Type HTTP header, if any,
   contributes any type information; the official type of the resource
   is then the value of that header, interpreted as described by the
   HTTP specifications.  If the Content-Type HTTP header is present but
   the value of the last such header cannot be interpreted as described
   by the HTTP specifications (e.g. because its value doesn't contain a
   U+002F SOLIDUS ('/') character), then the resource has no type
   information (even if there are multiple Content-Type HTTP headers and
   one of the other ones is syntactically correct).

   For resources fetched from the file system, user agents should use
   platform-specific conventions, e.g. operating system file extension/
   type mappings.

      Note: It is essential that file extensions are not used for
      determining the media type for resources fetched over HTTP because
      file extensions can often by supplied by malicious parties.

   For resources fetched over most other protocols, e.g.  FTP, there is
   no type information.

   The algorithm for extracting an encoding from a Content-Type, given a
   string s, is as follows.  It either returns an encoding or nothing.

   1.  Find the first seven characters in s that are an ASCII case-
       insensitive match for the word "charset".  If no such match is
       found, return nothing.

   2.  Skip any U+0009, U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, or U+0020 characters
       that immediately follow the word 'charset' (there might not be
       any).

   3.  If the next character is not a U+003D EQUALS SIGN ('='), return
       nothing.

   4.  Skip any U+0009, U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, or U+0020 characters
       that immediately follow the equals sign (there might not be any).

   5.  Process the next character as follows:

       *  If it is a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"') and there is a later
          U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"') in s, or

Internet-Draft        Content-Type Processing Model       September 2009


       *  If it is a U+0027 APOSTROPHE ("'") and there is a later U+0027
          APOSTROPHE ("'") in s

             Return the string between this character and the next
             earliest occurrence of this character.

       *  If it is an unmatched U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"'),

       *  If it is an unmatched U+0027 APOSTROPHE ("'"), or

       *  If there is no next character

             Return nothing.

       *  Otherwise

             Return the string from this character to the first U+0009,
             U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, U+0020, or U+003B character or the
             end of s, whichever comes first.

   Note: The above algorithm is a willful violation of the HTTP
   specification.  [RFC2616]

3.  Web Pages

   The /sniffed type/ of a resource is found as follows:

   1.  Let /official type/ be the type given by the Content-Type
       metadata for the resource, ignoring parameters.  Comparisons with
       this type, as defined by MIME specifications, are done in an
       ASCII case-insensitive manner.  [RFC2046]

   2.  If the user agent is configured to strictly obey Content-Type
       headers for this resource, then jump to the last step in this set
       of steps.

   3.  If the resource was fetched over an HTTP protocol and there is an
       HTTP Content-Type header and the value of the last such header
       has bytes that exactly match one of the following lines:

      +-------------------------------+--------------------------------+

       ...then jump to the "text or binary" section below.

   4.  If there is no /official type/, jump to the unknown type step
       below.

   5.  If /official type/ is "unknown/unknown", "application/unknown",
       or "*/*", jump to the unknown type step below.

   6.  If /official type/ ends in "+xml", or if it is either "text/xml"
       or "application/xml", then the /sniffed type/ of the resource is
       /official type/; return that and abort these steps.

   7.  If /official type/ is an image type supported by the user agent
       (e.g. "image/png", "image/gif", "image/jpeg", etc), then jump to
       the "images" section below, passing it the /official type/.

4.  Text or Binary

   1.  The user agent MAY wait for 512 or more bytes of the resource to
       be available.

   2.  Let n be the smaller of either 512 or the number of bytes already
       available.

   3.  If n is greater than or equal to 3, and the first 2 or 3 bytes of
       the resource match one of the following byte sequences:

                   +----------------------+--------------+
                   | Bytes in Hexadecimal | Description  |
                   +----------------------+--------------+
                   | FE FF                | UTF-16BE BOM |
                   | FF FE                | UTF-16LE BOM |
                   | EF BB BF             | UTF-8 BOM    |
                   +----------------------+--------------+

       ...then the /sniffed type/ of the resource is "text/plain".
       Abort these steps.

   4.  If none of the first n bytes of the resource are binary data
       bytes then the /sniffed type/ of the resource is "text/plain".
       Abort these steps.

                         +-------------------------+
                         | Binary Data Byte Ranges |
                         +-------------------------+
                         | 0x00 -- 0x08            |
                         | 0x0B                    |
                         | 0x0E -- 0x1A            |
                         | 0x1C -- 0x1F            |
                         +-------------------------+

   5.  If the first bytes of the resource match one of the byte
       sequences in the "pattern" column of the table in the unknown
       type section below, ignoring any rows whose cell in the
       "security" column says "scriptable" (or "n/a"), then the /sniffed
       type/ of the resource is the type given in the corresponding cell
       in the "sniffed type" column on that row; abort these steps.

          WARNING!  It is critical that this step not ever return a
          scriptable type (e.g. text/html), as otherwise that would
          allow a privilege escalation attack.

5.  Unknown Type

   1.  The user agent MAY wait for 512 or more bytes of the resource to
       be available.

   2.  Let /stream length/ be the smaller of either 512 or the number of
       bytes already available.

   3.  For each row in the table below:

       *  If the row has no "WS" bytes:

          1.  Let /pattern length/ be the length of the pattern (number
              of bytes described by the cell in the second column of the
              row).

          2.  If /stream length/ is smaller than /pattern length/ then
              skip this row.

          3.  Apply the "and" operator to the first /pattern length/
              bytes of the resource and the given mask (the bytes in the
              cell of first column of that row), and let the result be
              the data.

          4.  If the bytes of the data matches the given pattern bytes
              exactly, then the /sniffed type/ of the resource is the
              type given in the cell of the third column in that row;
              abort these steps.

       *  If the row has a "WS" byte:

          1.  Let /index pattern/ be an index into the mask and pattern
              byte strings of the row.

          2.  Let /index stream/ be an index into the byte stream being
              examined.

          3.  Loop: If /index stream/ points beyond the end of the byte
              stream, then this row doesn't match, skip this row.

          4.  Examine the /index stream/th byte of the byte stream as
              follows:

              -  If the /index pattern/th byte of the pattern is a
                 normal hexadecimal byte and not a "WS" byte:

                    If the "and" operator, applied to the /index
                    stream/th byte of the stream and the /index

                    pattern/th byte of the mask, yield a value different
                    that the /index pattern/th byte of the pattern, then
                    skip this row.

                    Otherwise, increment /index pattern/ to the next
                    byte in the mask and pattern and /index stream/ to
                    the next byte in the byte stream.

              -  Otherwise, if the /index pattern/th byte of the pattern
                 is a "WS" byte:

                    "WS" means "whitespace", and allows insignificant
                    whitespace to be skipped when sniffing for a type
                    signature.

                    If the /index stream/th byte of the stream is one of
                    0x09 (ASCII TAB), 0x0A (ASCII LF), 0x0C (ASCII FF),
                    0x0D (ASCII CR), or 0x20 (ASCII space), then
                    increment only the /index stream/ to the next byte
                    in the byte stream.

                    Otherwise, increment only the /index pattern/ to the
                    next byte in the mask and pattern.

          5.  If /index pattern/ does not point beyond the end of the
              mask and pattern byte strings, then jump back to the loop
              step in this algorithm.

          6.  Otherwise, the /sniffed type/ of the resource is the type
              given in the cell of the third column in that row; abort
              these steps.

   4.  If none of the first n bytes of the resource are binary data
       bytes then the sniffed type of the resource is "text/plain".
       Abort these steps.

   5.  Otherwise, the sniffed type of the resource is "application/
       octet-stream".

   User agents may support additional types if desired, by implicitly
   adding to the above table.  However, user agents should not use any
   other patterns for types already mentioned in the table above because
   this could then be used for privilege escalation (where, e.g., a
   server uses the above table to determine that content is not HTML and
   thus safe from cross-site scriping attacks, but then a user agent
   detects it as HTML anyway and allows script to execute).

   The column marked "security" is used by the algorithm in the "text or
   binary" section, to avoid sniffing text/plain content as a type that
   can be used for a privilege escalation attack.

   If the resource's /official type/ is "image/svg+xml", then the
   /sniffed type/ of the resource is its /official type/ (an XML type).

   Otherwise, if the first bytes of the resource match one of the byte
   sequences in the first column of the following table, then the
   /sniffed type/ of the resource is the type given in the corresponding
   cell in the second column on the same row:

     +-------------------------+--------------------------+----------+

   Otherwise, the /sniffed type/ of the resource is the same as its
   /official type/.

7.  Feed or HTML

   1.   The user agent MAY wait for 512 or more bytes of the resource to
        be available.

   2.   Let s be the stream of bytes, and let s[i] represent the byte in
        s with position i, treating s as zero-indexed (so the first byte
        is at i=0).

   3.   If at any point this algorithm requires the user agent to
        determine the value of a byte in s which is not yet available,
        or which is past the first 512 bytes of the resource, or which
        is beyond the end of the resource, the algorithm stops and the
        /sniffed type/ of the resource is "text/html".

           Note: User agents are allowed, by the first step of this
           algorithm, to wait until the first 512 bytes of the resource
           are available.

   4.   Initialize pos to 0.

   5.   If s[0] equals 0xEF, s[1] equals 0xBB, and s[2] equals 0xBF,
        then set pos to 3.  (This skips over a leading UTF-8 BOM, if
        any.)

   6.   Loop start: Examine s[pos].

        *  If it equals 0x09 (ASCII tab), 0x20 (ASCII space), 0x0A
           (ASCII LF), or 0x0D (ASCII CR)

              Increase pos by 1 and repeat this step.

        *  If it equals 0x3C (ASCII "<")

              Increase pos by 1 and go to the next step.

        *  If it is anything else

              The sniffed type of the resource is "text/html".  Abort
              these steps.

   7.   If the bytes with positions pos to pos+2 in s are exactly equal
        to 0x21, 0x2D, 0x2D respectively (ASCII for "!--"), then:

        1.  Increase pos by 3.

        2.  If the bytes with positions pos to pos+2 in s are exactly
            equal to 0x2D, 0x2D, 0x3E respectively (ASCII for "-->"),

            then increase pos by 3 and jump back to the previous step
            (the step labeled loop start) in the overall algorithm in
            this section.

        3.  Otherwise, increase pos by 1.

        4.  Return to step 2 in these substeps.

   8.   If s[pos] equals 0x21 (ASCII "!"):

        1.  Increase pos by 1.

        2.  If s[pos] equals 0x3E, then increase pos by 1 and jump back
            to the step labeled loop start in the overall algorithm in
            this section.

        3.  Otherwise, return to step 1 in these substeps.

   9.   If s[pos] equals 0x3F (ASCII "?"):

        1.  Increase pos by 1.

        2.  If s[pos] and s[pos+1] equal 0x3F and 0x3E respectively,
            then increase pos by 1 and jump back to the step labeled
            loop start in the overall algorithm in this section.

        3.  Otherwise, return to step 1 in these substeps.

   10.  Otherwise, if the bytes in s starting at pos match any of the
        sequences of bytes in the first column of the following table,
        then the user agent must follow the steps given in the
        corresponding cell in the second column of the same row.

   16.  If /RDF flag/ is 1 and /RSS flag/ is 1, then the /sniffed type/
        of the resource is "application/rss+xml".  Abort these steps.

   17.  If pos points beyond the end of the byte stream s, then continue

   18.  Jump back to step 13 of this algorithm.

   19.  The /sniffed type/ of the resource is "text/html".

   For efficiency reasons, implementations may wish to implement this
   algorithm and the algorithm for detecting the character encoding of
   HTML documents in parallel.

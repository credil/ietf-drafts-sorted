    Addressing bit compression for stateless IPv6 prefix translation
                        draft-tremblay-pt66ac-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method to extend IPv6 prefix translation
   [NAT66] to statelessly translate between IPv6 prefixes of differing
   lengths.  This technique, called PT66 addressing bit compression
   (PT66-AC), provides a way to map a shorter prefix (such as the fixed
   [6to4] prefix) to a longer global unicast prefix, while avoiding
   stateful translation.  The difference between the prefix lengths is
   compensated for by removing an unused string of subnetting bits, as
   specified, from the addresses within the shorter prefix.

1.  Introduction

   Since IPv6 has become a standard, multiple transition mechanisms have
   been proposed to stimulate the rate of IPv6 adoption.  Some of these
   mechanisms use specific addressing space and fixed lengths for
   different types of prefixes.  There is sometimes a need to translate
   a protocol-specific addressing space into global unicast space to
   improve the routing behavior.  Of course, this improvement to routing
   comes at the cost of lowered interoperability for some applications.

   One issue with translating these prefixes is the challenge of
   obtaining a globally unique prefix of appropriate size.  However,
   there are often a number of bits rarely used within the transition
   protocol specific prefixes.  Using an address translator with
   addressing bit compression allows a deployment to drop these unused
   bits and make more efficient usage of the public addressing space.

   For example, the IPv6 transition protocol [6to4] statelessly maps 32
   bit IPv4 addresses into the 2002::/16 prefix, to create a /48 IPv6
   prefix for every IPv4 address.  Normally, return traffic destined to
   this prefix will be routed to the nearest 6to4 relay router.  An ISP
   may wish to gain control over return routing of the 6to4 traffic by
   mapping their 6to4 address space into a globally unique IPv6 prefix.

   Implementing this without addressing bit compression would require an
   IPv6 /32 for every /16 of IPv4 global space assigned to an ISP.
   Acquiring the required IPv6 space from a Regional Internet Registry
   is therefore unrealistic in most cases.  Using addressing bit
   compression, an ISP can make better use of the globally unique IPv6
   space by reducing the size of the 6to4 subnet available to each user.


2.  IPv6 Translator Model

   The current stateless IPv6 prefix translation model is described in
   [NAT66].  In that model, IPv6 traffic is translated between an
   internal network and an external network.

   An IPv6 translator model described in [NAT66]:

           External Network:  Prefix = 2001:0DB8:0001:/48

           Internal Network:  Prefix = FD01:0203:0405:/48


   This translation model may be represented in a generic fashion by
   replacing the address characters with letters denoting the function
   of those address bits.  The representation below describes a single
   translation mapping in a device that may implement several.

      L - Internal (or "Local") network IPv6 prefix

3.  IPv6 Prefix Translation with Addressing Compression

   It is implicit that any basic [NAT66] mapping must be between
   prefixes of the same size, as each prefix of is overwritten by the
   other as traffic passes through.  The section below gives a
   description of how to map internal and external networks of different
   lengths.  In this example, the internal prefix used is a larger /28,
   while the external prefix used is a smaller /40.

      L - Local or Internal network IPv6 prefix

      E - External network IPv6 prefix

      S - Shifted subnet bits

      N - Unmodified subnet bits

      C - Compressed (removed) bits

      I - Interface Identifier (IID) bits

               --------------------------------------
   Internal Network Prefix = LLLL:LLLS:SSSS:CCCN:IIII:IIII:IIII:IIII


   In this translation model, the N bits (4 bits represented) from the
   internal subnet are left untouched.  The C bits (12 bits represented)
   are the compressed bits, not present in the external network prefix.
   The S bits (20 bits represented) are bitwise shifted to the right by
   the length of the C bits when translating from the internal network
   to the external network.  This compression of the subnet allows for
   the adaptation from the larger prefix to the smaller prefix to be
   made.  The L bits (28 bits represented) are replaced by the E bits

   (40 bits represented) when translating from the internal network to
   the external network.

   In this document, traffic received on the internal network interface
   and forwarded by the external traffic interface is called egress
   traffic.  Inversely, any traffic received on the external network
   interface and forwarded to the internal network interface is called
   ingress traffic.

3.1.  Configuration Elements

   The IPv6 prefix translation with addressing compression model
   (PT66-AC) makes use of the following variables:

      L Length of the internal network prefix

      E Length of the external network prefix

      S Number of shifted bits

      C Number of compressed bits

      N Number of unchanged subnet bits

   In order to avoid confusion and increase readability, both the full
   name and variable notation of the above parameters are used
   throughout this document.

   In this translation model, the sum of the length of the internal
   network prefix (L), of the number of shifted bits (S), of the number
   of compressed bits (C) and of the number of unchanged bits (N) always
   equals 64 (L + S + C + N = 64).  As well, the sum of the length of
   the external network (E), of the number of shifted bits (S) and of
   the number of unchanged bits (N) always equals 64 (E + S + N = 64).

   Hence the number of compressed bits (C) is always equal to the length
   of the external prefix minus the length of the local prefix (C = E -
   L).  Only the length of each prefix need be defined, and the length
   of the compressed bits (C) can be derived from those values.
   Similarly, in order to know the number of shifted bits (S) and
   unchanged bits (N), one of these two must be defined in the
   configuration of the translation mapping.  Therefore, the elements
   that must be defined in a translation mapping with compression are
   the internal network prefix and its length (L), the external network
   prefix and its length (E) and either the number of shifted bits (S)
   or unchanged bits (N).

   With these configuration elements defined for each translation

   mapping, an IPv6 translator can statelessly translate ingress and
   egress traffic between prefixes of differing length.

3.2.  Egress Translation Behavior for Compressed Bits

   The value of the bits compressed is hereto referred to as the
   'compressed bit pattern'.  By default, any egress traffic MUST be
   dropped if the compressed bit pattern is not equal to zero.
   Optionally, a compressed bit pattern different from all zeros may be
   defined by configuration and used to filter incoming traffic.  The
   compressed bit pattern length MUST be equal to the difference between
   the length of the external prefix and the length of the internal
   prefix (C must equal E - L).

   The translation device SHOULD issue an ICMP type 1 (Destination
   Unreachable) message with code 5 (Source address failed ingress/
   egress policy) to the source address when dropping traffic for the
   first time for each source address/destination address pair.

3.3.  Ingress Translation Behavior for Compressed Bits

   For traffic entering the external network interface of the
   translator, the compressed bits MUST be restored with zeros by
   default, unless a different compressed bit pattern has been
   configured for the mapping.  In such a case, the user-defined
   compressed bit pattern MUST be used to restore the compressed bits.

3.4.  Translator Operation

   For traffic entering the external network interface of the
   translator, the compressed bits MUST be restored with zeros by
   default, unless a different compressed bit pattern has been
   configured for the mapping.  In such a case, the user-defined
   compressed bit pattern MUST be used to restore the compressed bits.

3.4.1.  Egress Traffic Operation

   For each egress packet, the prefix translator MUST use the
   appropriate translation mapping with the longest matching internal
   prefix.  The S bits of the IPv6 source address are shifted bitwise to
   the right by the number of compressed bits (C).  The leftmost bits of
   the source address (L) are replaced by the bits of the external
   network prefix (E).  Unchanged bits (N) of the source address MUST
   NOT be modified.

3.4.2.  Ingress Traffic Operation

   For each ingress packet, the prefix translator MUST use the
   appropriate translation mapping.  Selection of the appropriate
   mapping is outside of the scope of this document.  The behavior of
   the translator when no mapping is matched is also out of scope for
   this document.  Asynchronous mappings between internal and external
   prefixes, where an ingress source address translated does not in turn
   translate back to the same destination address on egress traffic,
   SHOULD be prevented.

   Once a suitable mapping is found, the leftmost bits of the
   destination address are replaced by the corresponding bits from the
   local network prefix (L).  Starting at the bit position equal to the
   length of the external prefix (E), the Shifted bits are bitwise
   shifted to the left by the number of compressed bits (C).  The C bits
   are restored with zeros, or the compressed bit pattern if set in the
   mapping configuration.  Unchanged bits (N) of the destination address
   MUST NOT be modified.


4.  Examples

4.1.  6to4 Subnet Compression

   When an IPv6 prefix translator is used with a 6to4 prefix as the
   internal network, it is possible to compress seldom-used subnet bits
   in order to reduce the size of the external global unicast prefix.
   As specified in [6to4], a 6to4 router will define a /48 for each IPv4
   global unicast address.  This provides 16 bits of subnet addressing
   available to the user.  The 6to4 protocol being often implemented by
   residential gateways, only one LAN subnet (/64) is utilized in most
   implementations.  It is therefore possible to reduce the number of
   available /64 subnets available from 65536 (16 bits) to 16 (4 bits)
   or even a single one (0 subnet bits).  The following example
   compresses the 16 subnet bits to 4 bits, leaving room for 16 /64
   subnets.

   The prefix translation model for 6to4 is similar to the generic
   model, with the internal network bits (L) being defined as 2002::/16.
   The 32 bits of the 6to4 router IPv4 address are the shifted bits (S).

   This example uses 192.0.2.1 as the 6to4 router IPv4 address and 2001:
   DB0::/28 as the provider global unicast prefix.  A single subnet
   number 0001 is used.  A single host exchanges traffic from Interface
   ID ::A.

   In this example, the ISP configures the PT66-AC with the following
   mapping: 2002::/16, 2001:DB0::/28, C=12 (or N=4)

   During operation, egress traffic from address 2002:C000:0201:1::A is
   translated as follow:

   2002:C000:0201:0001::A  Egress packets source address
   2002:C00C:0000:2011::A  Shift S bits (32 bits) to the right
                           by C bits (12 bits)
   2001:0DBC:0000:2011::A  Replace L bits by E bits. This is the new
                           egress source address.

   The inverse operations takes place for ingress traffic with
   destinations within 2001:db0::/28:

   2001:0DBC:0000:2011::A  Incoming destination address
   2002:0DBC:0000:2011::A  Leftmost bits are replaced by the L bits
                           (16 bits)
   2002:C000:0201:2011::A  The 32 S bits are shifted to the left
                           by C bits (12 bits)
   2002:C000:0201:0001::A  The C bits are restored. This is the new
                           destination address on the local network

   This example demonstrated how to compress the 12 first bits of the
   6to4 subnet bits in order for an ISP to use a longer global unicast
   prefix for the external network.

4.2.  6to4 IPv4 and Subnet Compression

   As an improvement over the previous example, the ISP also has the
   opportunity to compress the IPv4 prefix part of the IPv4 address in

   recovered from the mapping when translating ingress traffic.
   Omitting this allows the ISP to use an even smaller prefix on the
   external interface.

   This example is similar the previous one, with the addition that the
   IPv4 prefix 192.0.2.0/24 will also be compressed.  The external
   prefix used by the ISP is now 2001:db8:FFFF:F000::/52.  The 6to4
   subnet remains compressed from 16 to 4 bits.

   A translation mapping is configured as follow: 2002:C000:0200::/40,
   2001:0DB8:FFFF:F000::/52, C=12 (or N=4)

   External Network Prefix = EEEE:EEEE:EEEE:ESSN:IIII:IIII:IIII:IIII
                             2001:0DB8:FFFF:F011:0000:0000:0000:000A

   Ingress operation for destinations within 2001:db8:FFFF:F000::/52:

   2001:0DB8:FFFF:F011::A  Incoming destination address
   2002:C000:02FF:F011::A  Leftmost bits are replaced
                           by the L bits (40 bits)
   2002:C000:0201:F011::A  The S bits (8 bits) are shifted to
                           the left by C bits (12 bits)
   2002:C000:0201:0001::A  The C bits are restored. This is the
                           new destination address on local network

   This example demonstrates that both the IPv4 addressing and the
   subnet parts of a 6to4 prefix can be compressed.  It is therefore
   possible to translate a provider's own 6to4 addressing subset (from
   its own global IPv4 unicast space) to a set of global IPv6 unicast
   prefixes that are small enough not to require an extremely large IPv6
   global unicast assignment.

   The resulting IPv6 unicast prefixes are also completely decoupled
   from IPv4 and avoid the need for injection of IPv4 routing
   information in the IPv6 routing table in order to achieve better
   routing.

6.  Security Considerations

   All of the security considerations of [NAT66] are still applicable
   when address bit compression is applied.  The stateless address
   mapping of NAT66 allows for direct inbound connections to internal
   nodes, something not present in NAT44.

   In addition, an implementation of NAT66 with addressing bit
   compression must be aware of the potential for a DOS attack against
   the device by an internal node intentionally sending packets that do
   not match the compressed bit pattern.  This would force the
   generation of ICMP unreachable messages to the source address, which
   could be spoofed, and could potentially impact the operation of both
   the NAT66 device and the legitimate user of the spoofed source
   address.  For this reason, it is recommended that the rate of ICMP
   unreachable messages generated is limited.

   Another possibility of resource exhaustion is to receive packets on
   an interface that doesn't have any mapping for the source or
   destination.  For example, traffic with an internal destination
   coming on the outside interface.  Such traffic SHOULD be silently
   dropped.

Abstract

   This memo specifies two new algorithms for IPsec.  One is the usage
   of Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) with the Camellia
   block cipher as an authentication mechanism in the IPsec
   Encapsulating Security Payload and Authentication Header protocols.
   This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-96.  The other algorithm is a
   pseudo-random function (PRF) based on CMAC with the Camellia block
   cipher for the Internet Key Exchange, version 2.  This algorithm is
   called Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.

Internet-Draft    The Camellia CMAC-96 and CMAC-PRF-128    December 2009


1.  Introduction

   The NIST specification [1] for the CMAC (Cipher-based Message
   Authentication Code) mode of operation for a block cipher describes a
   method to use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as a Message
   Authentication Code (MAC) that has a 128-bit output length.

   The Camellia block cipher has the same external interface as the AES.
   This memo specifies two new algorithms for IPsec that replace AES by
   Camellia in already specified applications of CMAC for IPsec [8] and
   [9].  One is the usage of CMAC mode with Camellia [2] as the
   underlying block cipher as an authentication mechanism in the IPsec
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [5] and Authentication Header
   (AH) [4] protocols.  This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-96.  The
   128-bit CMAC output is also useful as a long-lived Pseudo-Random
   Function (PRF).  Thus, the other algorithm is a PRF based on CMAC
   with the Camellia block cipher for version 2 of the Internet Key
   Exchange (IKEv2) [6] that supports fixed and variable key sizes for
   the Key Derivation Function (KDF) and authentication, respectively.
   This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.

   The Camellia algorithm and its properties are described in [2].  This
   document does not cover implementation details of CMAC.  Those
   details can be found in [1].  For further information on IKE, AH and
   ESP, refer to [3], [4], [5], and [6].

3.  Camellia-CMAC

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
   specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) [1].
   CMAC is a keyed hash function that is based on a symmetric key block
   cipher, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard [10].  The CMAC
   algorithm provides a framework for inserting various block cipher
   algorithms.

   Camellia-CMAC uses the Camellia block cipher [2] as a building block
   in CMAC [1].  To generate a MAC, Camellia-CMAC(K, M, len) takes a
   secret key 'K', a message of variable length 'M', and the length of
   the message in octets 'len' as inputs and returns a fixed-length bit
   string.

   In this specification, Camellia-CMAC is always used with 128-bit
   length key.

4.  Camellia-CMAC-96

   For IPsec message authentication in AH and ESP, Camellia-CMAC is used
   in its truncated form denoted as Camellia-CMAC-96 -- Camellia-CMAC
   with its output truncated to 96 bits.  Its output is a 96-bit MAC
   that meets the default authenticator length as specified in [4].  The
   result of truncation is taken in MSB-first order.

   Figure 1 describes Camellia-CMAC-96 algorithm:

   In step 1, Camellia-CMAC with key K is applied to the message M of
   length len octets.

   In step 2, the output of step 1 is truncated to its first 12 octets,
   and the result (TT) is returned.

5.  Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128

   The Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 algorithm is identical to Camellia-CMAC
   except that the 128-bit key length restriction is removed.

   IKEv2 [6] uses PRFs for multiple purposes, most notably for
   generating keying material and authentication of the IKE_SA.

   When using Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 as the PRF described in [6],
   Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 is considered to admit a variable key length in
   all places, and the amount of keying material generated when new keys
   are generated is 128 bits (i.e., preferred key length when generating
   keying material of SK_d, SK_pi, and SK_pr is 128 bits).

   When generating SKEYSEED the full of Ni and Nr are used as key for
   the PRF.

   follows:

   o  If the key VK is exactly 128 bits, then we use it as-is (step 1a).

   o  If it is longer or shorter than 128 bits, then we derive the key K
      by applying the Camellia-CMAC algorithm using the 128-bit all-zero
      string as the key and VK as the input message (step 1b).

   In step 2, we apply the Camellia-CMAC algorithm using K as the key
   and M as the input message.  The output of this algorithm is
   returned.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security provided by Camellia-CMAC-96 and Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128
   is built on the strong cryptographic algorithm Camellia and CMAC.  At
   the time of this writing, there are no known practical cryptographic
   attacks against Camellia or CMAC.

   However, as is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of its
   strength lies in the secret key, K, and the correctness of the
   implementation in all of the participating systems.  If the secret
   key is compromised or inappropriately shared, it guarantees neither
   authentication nor message integrity at all.  The secret key shall be
   generated in a way that meets the pseudo randomness requirement of
   RFC 4086 [7] and should be kept safe.  If and only if
   Camellia-CMAC-96 and Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 are used properly it
   provides the authentication and integrity that meet the best current
   practice of message authentication.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has allocated value <TBD1> for IKEv2 Transform Type 3
   (Integrity Algorithm) to the AUTH_CAMELLIA_CMAC_96 algorithm, and has
   allocated a value of <TBD2> for IKEv2 Transform Type 2 (Pseudo-Random
   Function) to the PRF_CAMELLIA128_CMAC algorithm.

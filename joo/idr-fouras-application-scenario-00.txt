Internet-Draft   4-octet AS number application scenario     October 2010


1.  Introduction

   AS numbers that are currently in use are based on the 2-octet system,
   and this is expected to become exhausted in the near future, like the
   IPv4 address system.

   4-octet AS numbers are designed as an extension to 2-octet AS
   numbers, and the number of AS numbers available for allocation is
   increased by 65,000 times to cope with AS number exhaustion. A
   shortage is not likely in the short term, but long-term supply may be
   problematic.

   This document is designed to help organizations in their use of 4-
   octet AS numbers in the future by checking the possibility of
   interaction between 2-octet AS numbers and 4-octet AS numbers for
   each scenario, based on the compatibility of heterogeneous equipment
   used in the actual network related to 4-octet AS numbers, and by
   verifying the interoperability of networks specified in each scenario
   - before using 4-octet AS numbers, before applying 4-octet AS
   numbers, as well as the influence on service traffic at the time of
   interaction.



2. Definition of terms

   - New Speaker: BGP router that supports RFC4893 and 4-octet or
     2-octet configuration (in other words, OS upgraded router)

   - Old Speaker : BGP router that cannot support RFC4893, and supports 
     2-octet configuration only (in other words, OS non-upgraded router)


3.  Use and composition of 4-octet AS numbers

   - "AS TRANS#23456" was newly reserved for interoperability between 
     4-octet AS number capable speakers and non 4-octet capable BGP
     speakers.

   - Mechanisms that build up AS PATH information using AS_PATH and 
     AS4_PATH were implemented.

   - Mapping at AS_PATH using the reserved AS23456 is used.

   - ISP allocated with new 4-octet AS numbers can configure a complete 
     AS Path because these numbers are compatible with 2-octet numbers.

   - ISPs that once used allocated 2-octet numbers can link with the

Internet-Draft   4-octet AS number application scenario     October 2010


     ISPs newly allocated with 4-octet AS numbers. 

   - However, 4-octet AS numbers (e.g., AS65536(1.0)) are not 
     accurately recognized, but recognized as the reserved "AS23456"

   - ISPs allocated with 2-octet AS numbers can link with 4-octet AS 
     numbers without the need for an OS upgrade.

   - ISPs can upgrade the OS and replace the equipment gradually, in 
     order to introduce the route that can recognize 4-octet numbers.

4.  4-octet AS number applications 

   4.1  4-octet AS number application scenario

   The heterogeneous environment using 2-octet AS numbers was
   configured, and this was similar to the actual network configuration.
   Then, a linkage with 4-octet AS numbers in the network was applied,
   and the scenario to the service traffic test was performed over
   stages.


     ========                =============
     AS64496 ------------------AS64497
     ========                =============
         |                        |

      AS65550(1.14) -------  AS65551(1.15)

     ==============         ================

                    [Figure 1]

   The command used to apply 4-octet AS numbers to the equipment is
   different for each manufacturer. The router used for the scenario
   only accept the ASDOT setting, because only the OS that supports
   ASDOT type 4-octet AS was released.

   Equipment belonging to each AS number shown in Figure 1 performs the
   full-mesh type interface among all AS numbers, before configuring and
   unfolding the scenario.

   A total of three peers were established - AS64497, which is the
   remainder of AS64496 excluding itself, and 131100 and 131101 - 4-
   octet AS numbers. However, it was found that two 4-octet AS numbers
   were recognized as AS23456, as there was an OLD speaker that could
   not recognize 4-octet AS numbers at all.

Internet-Draft   4-octet AS number application scenario     October 2010


   AS65550(1.14) was a NEW speaker set with 4-octet AS numbers. It was
   found that AS65550(1.14) exchanges AS-PATH with the peer expressed by
   4-octet AS numbers between heterogeneous equipment in the interface
   information and routing table.

   The routing table information that transits the network in question
   was clearly expressed, as the interface was established with two 2-
   octet AS numbers excluding 2.28 (131100) - own AS number, and one 4-
   octet AS number - 2.29 (131101).

   In addition, equipment that is a NEW speaker assigned with 4-octet AS
   numbers and linked by iBGP, instead of a border router, has only one
   optimal set of path information, not the multiple path information
   recognized as 4-octet AS numbers.

   Regardless of the 4-octet expression method - ASDOT or ASPLAIN, it is
   recognized and expressed by local equipment only, and could not
   affect the interface work or routing table exchange at all

   4.2  2-octet <-> 4-octet <-> 2-octet link

   This test is designed for cases in which heterogeneous equipment is
   configured in such a way that the service traffic path passes through
   the border area of 2-octet numbers and 4-octet numbers several times.

   The test was designed to check how traffic generated in a 2-octet AS
   number network affects service quality if it is sent to the 2-octet
   AS number network via the 4-octet AS number network. The test was
   made in the configuration shown in Figure 2.

   4.3  4-octet <-> 2-octet <-> 4-octet link

   Among various test cases in which the service traffic path passes
   through the border area of 2-octet numbers and 4-octet numbers
   several times, this test was designed to check how traffic generated
   in a 4-octet AS number network affects service quality if it is sent
   to the 4-octet AS number network via the 2-octet AS number network. 

   The test was made in the configuration shown in Figure 3.

                            (iBGP congruation)           
     ==============         ==================

                     [Figure 3]

   The above figure shows the trace route result that traffic is traced
   from the PC connected to AS65551(1.15) to the FTP server connected to
   AS65550(1.14) via AS64497.

   The file was sent to the FTP server connected to AS65551(1.15) from
   the PC connected to AS65550(1.14) via AS64497, which clearly
   indicated that traffic was sent reverse. 

5. Additional items to consider for 4-octet AS number

   5.1 If OLD speaker exists in the iBGP segment within a 4-octet 
       AS number


       ===============
        AS65551(1.15)
      (iBGP congruation)           
       ================


   There was a problem wherein the same AS number cannot be set for the
   OLD speaker in the iBGP segment, as 4-octet AS numbers are not
   supported.

   It was checked as to whether AS23456 could be used in the iBGP
   segment, because it cannot be used according to the 4-octet AS number

Internet-Draft   4-octet AS number application scenario     October 2010


   standard, as it is a reserved AS number.

   As AS23456 is used to interface with 4-octet AS numbers in OLD
   speaker, Local-AS of the OLD speaker was set to 23456, but the
   interface itself failed.

   To make another attempt, Local-AS of the OLD speaker was set to the
   private AS number for testing.

   In conclusion, it is recommended to exclude the OLD speaker
   (equipment not recognizing 4-octet AS numbers) from the iBGP segment
   in the 4-octet AS number.

   On the other hand, if the 4-octet AS number network is used, the
   border router is supposed to be composed of equipment that can
   basically recognize and run 4-octet AS numbers. 

   Therefore, this network can operate regardless of the counterpart
   peer's status - use of 2-octet AS numbers or 4-octet AS numbers.

   However, problems may be presented if any internal equipment that
   interfaces with iBGP cannot recognize 4-octet AS numbers.

   Basically, this kind of equipment should use 2-octet AS numbers
   (because 4-octet AS numbers cannot be used), and iBGP interface
   cannot be established with 4-octet AS numbers.

   In conclusion, the 2-octet private AS number should be used.
   (According to the test results, interface with 4-octet AS numbers was
   not established if set to AS23456.)

   This implies that the network does not use a single AS number.

   In summary, if the network uses 2-octet AS numbers, equipment does
   not need to recognize 4-octet AS numbers. (However, it is recommended
   to upgrade the border router that recognizes 4-octet AS numbers for
   the purpose of routing policy flexibility.) 

   If the network uses 4-octet AS numbers, the network would run stably
   only when all equipment to be installed with the BGP is upgraded.

   5.2 Equipment load amount measurement in line with 4-octet AS number
       use


   For proper comparison, this test compared the same equipment and
   memory use amounts.

     ------------------------------------------------------------
     Number of prefixes      |      10        |      10      
     ============================================================
                           [Figure 4]

   As shown in Figure 4, there was approximately a 16% difference in the
   rate of use, even though the same number of peers and network tables
   is managed (received 9, connected 1, best 4).

   As this difference can become larger with an increase of interfacing
   neighbors and managing network tables, it would be more stable for
   equipment using 4-octet AS numbers to secure sufficient memory.

   Of course, the equipment's memory use amount can differ depending on
   the OS version installed in the equipment, as the AS_PATH information
   in 4-octet AS numbers uses data size two times more than that of 2-
   octet AS numbers, due to the number configuration system. In theory,
   the memory use amount of 4-octet AS_PATH requires two times as much
   memory as 2-octet AS_PATH.

   5.3  Verification of 4-octet AS number applications in the IPv6 
        environment

   With the anticipation that the future IP environment will gradually
   transit to an IPv6 environment, it was verified whether 4-octet AS
   numbers to be newly applied can be interfaced in the IPv6 environment
   just like in the IPv4 environment.

   For interface compatibility in the AS number environment composed of
   heterogeneous equipment, the BGP serial IP and announce network were
   defined with IPv6, as shown in Figure 5. The verification was
   designed to determine if there were any problems in the interaction
   between 2-octet AS numbers and 4-octet AS numbers in the IPv6
   environment.

   To apply the IPv6 address, the IPv6 routing option should be enabled
   (activated) in each equipment item for BGP interface with IPv6.

Internet-Draft   4-octet AS number application scenario     October 2010


   It was found that interaction with 4-octet AS numbers in the IPv6
   environment is not an obstacle at all, according to the results of
   verifying the BGP neighbor status and routing table exchange after
   completing the settings.

6.  Conclusion

   The result of the interaction between 4-octet AS numbers and 2-octet
   AS numbers shows that the NEW speaker, which supports 4-octet AS
   numbers, can apply 4-octet AS numbers just like BGP declaration in
   the existing environment.

   The only difference is that the declared AS number is 32 bits (4
   bytes) in size, instead of 16 bits (2 bytes).

   In addition, the interface between the network applied with 4-octet
   AS numbers and the one applied with 2-octet AS numbers can be
   established without difficulty using the agreed AS number "AS23456".

   However, the OLD speaker that recognizes 2-octet AS numbers only
   cannot separate networks uniquely and establish a routing policy,
   while the AS23456 network size grows as the number of 4-octet AS
   number networks increases.

   Therefore, it is necessary to plan OS and hardware upgrades so that
   OLD speaker systems can recognize 4-octet AS numbers. This is in
   order to cope with the full-scale use of 4-octet AS numbers and the
   corresponding increase in the number of networks.

   The test result indicated that 4-octet AS number interaction is not
   affected by the IP environment - IPv4 or IPv6.

   Theoretically, the interface using 4-octet AS numbers should not
   cause large differences in speed, because the data service is
   affected by the packet forwarding capability of the transit
   equipment, although first peering establishment and routing table
   updating could take more time than those using 2-octet AS numbers.

   Considering that speed is not dropped in proportion to the number of
   4-octet AS number transit points, the test in more diverse
   environments should use 4-octet AS numbers, instead of conducting a
   simple test.

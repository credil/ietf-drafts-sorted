Internet-Draft            Multi-path for OLSRv2                 May 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a lightweight extension of the OLSRv2
   protocol [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2], providing multiple paths for each
   destination, when such paths are available.

   Multi-path routing increases reliability by detecting the
   availability of redundant paths.  OLSRv2, in its basic specification,
   does not provide multiple routes for a given destination.  On the
   other hand, the protocol provides every router with enough
   information to compute multiple routes to any specific destination,
   if available.

   Information about multiple paths per source-destination pair enables
   more successful end-to-end transmissions in a frequently changing
   network environment (e.g. in the case of a sudden breakdown of a
   relaying router), and favors throughput maximization in the case when
   multiple parallel transmissions without interferences (i.e.,
   appropriately distinct to each other) enable bypassing a network
   capacity bottleneck ([GNT06], [SS08], [SM09]).


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   All terms introduced in [RFC6130], including "interface", "network
   address", "1-hop neighbor", "symmetric 1-hop neighbor" are to be
   interpreted as described there.

   All terms introduced in [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2], including the terms
   "Router", "Routing Tuple", "Routing Set", "Network Topology Graph"
   are to be interpreted as described therein.


3.  Applicability

   The extension specified in this document is compliant with any OLSRv2
   implementation, and provides information about multiple paths per
   source-destination pair (when they are available), and such without
   requiring signaling other than that provided by the standard OLSRv2
   protocol.

   While multi-path routing may increase throughput and end-to-end
   transmission reliability, it may also increase the chances of packet

   forwarding loops.  It is thus recommended to use this specification
   jointly with a routing loop avoidance mechanism, such as the ones
   described in Section 7.


4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   This specification provides two modes of operation.  In the proactive
   mode, available redundant paths are systematically precomputed, while
   in the on-demand mode available redundant paths are computed on the
   go, as needed. routers in the network MUST all operate the same mode.
   The following sections specify the functionning of each mode.


5.  Proactive Multi-path Computation with OLSRv2

   In this mode, available redundant paths are systematically
   precomputed, preserving the proactive nature of the standard (i.e.
   single-path) OLSRv2.  Each router identifies all the possible next-
   hops through which there exists a good enough path to a given
   destination.

   Instead of running the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm with a
   computing router as the origin of every route (as it is in the case
   of single-path OLSRv2), the network-based multi-path algorithm
   examines all the neighbors of the computing router as potential next-
   hops on the route to a given destination.  More precisely, all the
   remaining neighbors (i.e., all except the examined one) are
   temporarily 'removed' from the topology graph together with their
   adjacent links, and the shortest path algorithm is executed with the
   examined neighbor as a origin.  According to the proposed algorithm,
   the computing router chooses only these neighbors as a next-hop for
   the given destination router, which are able to determine the
   remaining part of the route to the destination in a way that does not
   require backward transmission [SM09].

   The proactive multi-path route calculation algorithm may be described
   as follows [SMN+10]:

   1.  For each neighbor of router m do:

       A.  Delete all neighbors of router m with their adjacent links,
           except of the selected one.

       B.  Run standard single-path Dijkstra's algorithm for the
           obtained graph in order to determine Routing Tuples, with the
           selected neighbor as the next-hop on the route.

Internet-Draft            Multi-path for OLSRv2                 May 2011


   2.  Merge the obtained sets of Routing Tuples of neighboring routers
       into the final OLSRv2 Routing Set of router m that allows
       multiple entries for a given destination.

   As a result of an algorithm execution, the path-computing router
   obtains a separate set of Routing Tuples for each neighbor, which can
   be easily used to obtain the modified OLSRv2 Routing Set with
   multiple entries for a given destination.  In contrast to the
   standard OLSRv2 specification, for which "Routing Set MUST contain
   the shortest paths for all destinations from all local OLSRv2
   interfaces using the Network Topology Graph" (see Section 18.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-manet-olsrv2]), the Multi-path Extension of OLSRv2 allows
   using paths which MAY be longer than the shortest one for a given
   source/destination pair.  Tables presented in Appendix A contain
   routing entries which are compatible with standard OLSRv2 Routing
   Tuples, but allows multiple entries with the same destination
   addresses.

   An example presenting an execution of the multi-path algorithm may be
   also found in Appendix A.

5.1.  Optimization using MPR Selection

   For a further optimization, the set of examined neighbors of a
   computing router may be limited to the set of the router's MPRs.
   This method is aimed at increasing the route stability as well as the
   probability that the choice of next-hops for routes to a given
   destination will lead to parallel transmissions without
   interferences.  Such modification of the Proactive Multi-path
   algorithm is especially suitable for networks with dense topologies,
   since it allows to avoid undesirable forwarding through multiple
   paths sharing the same radio resources.  Such extension does not
   require introducing any modifications into the structure of OLSRv2
   Routing Tuples.


6.  On-demand Multi-path Computation with OLSRv2

   In this mode, available redundant paths are computed on the go, as
   needed.  This mode is recommended in networks with a significant
   number of long and more occasional flows, and may not be appropriate
   for networks with a very dynamic topology, though route recovery and
   loop detection schemes may alleviate issues with this mode in dynamic
   topologies [YADP10].

   The mechanism described in the following is invoked on demand to
   reach a destination d.  Note that it does not incur any signalling in
   addition to standard OLSRv2 signalling.  The general principle of

Internet-Draft            Multi-path for OLSRv2                 May 2011


   this mechanism is at step i to look for the shortest path Pi to the
   destination d.  Based on Dijkstra algorithm, the main modification
   consists in adding two cost functions namely incremental functions fp
   and fe in order to prevent the next steps to use similar path. fp is
   used to increase costs of arcs belonging to the previously path Pi
   (or which opposite arcs belong to it).  This encourages future paths
   to use different arcs but not different vertices. fe is used to
   increase costs of the arcs who lead to vertices of the previous path
   Pi.  Different fp and fe are chosen to get link-disjoint path or
   node-disjoint routes as necessary.  If id is the identity functions,
   3 cases are possible:

   o  if id=fe<fp paths tend to be arc disjoint;

   o  if id<fe=fp paths tend to be vertex-disjoint;

   o  if id<fe<fp paths also tend to be vertex-disjoint, but when is not
      possible they tend to be arc disjoint.

   The on-demand multi-path route calculation algorithm may be described
   as follows to get N distinct paths:

   1.  For each path 1 to N do:

       A.  Run Dijkstra algorithm to get the source tree.

       B.  Get the shortest path Pi for the on-demand destination d.

       C.  Apply cost functions fp and fe respectively on edges of Pi
           and pointing vertices of Pi.

   2.  Writing the entire route into IP source routing header.

   For the special case of more than 10 hops (specially large MANET),
   because IP source routing option accepts only a maximum of 9
   addresses (in total, 11 nodes including source and destination nodes
   = 10 hops), the loose source routing may be used.  Table 1 shows an
   example of the multi-path source routing table, which provides
   multiple routes to the destination.

   To compute on-demand multiple paths, another possible solution is
   instead of increasing the cost of the arc, the related node is
   deleted from the node set in order to get totally node-disjoint
   routes.  However, in the cases when the nodes are locally sparse i.e
   a partition of the MANET, deleting some key nodes might prevent from
   finding new route.  It is expected that keeping nodes in the routes
   calculation process provides more flexibility and better adaptation
   to the MANET topology.

6.1.  Route Recovery Mechnanism

   With source routing, the route is defined by the source, and the
   intermediate nodes just read the next hop information for the
   packet's source routing header.  Therefore, when source routing is
   used, updated topology information potentially available on
   intermediate nodes towards the destination is not used in case of
   topology changes.  Thus, route recovery mechanisms such as the one
   described below is necessary for dynamic scenarios.

   For instance, before an intermediate node tries to forward a packet
   to the next hop according to the source route, the node may first
   checks whether the next hop in the source route is one of its
   neighbors (by checking the 1-hop neighbor set).  If so, the packet is
   forwarded normally.  If not, it is possible that the "next hop" is
   not available anymore, and the node should thus recompute the route
   and forward the packet by using the new route.

   This route recovery mechanism does not introduce extra route
   discovery procedure or any additional signalling, while effectively
   avoid unavailable links.


7.  Loop Detection Mechanisms

   A loop detection scheme becomes necessary when packets can switch
   between multiple paths towards destination.  Loop detection can be
   provided by auxiliary mechanisms such as for instance:

   o  Backpressure-based scheduling [SMN+10]- on each router a scheduler
      utilizes a multi-path Routing Set jointly with information about
      backpressure weights.  Traffic of each flow is load-balanced among
      the possible relaying routers in a fully dynamic manner, i.e.,
      according to the most recent network state information.
      Backpressure-based scheduling requires additional queue level
      signaling (and introducing corresponding messages) which is beyond

      the scope of this document.

   o  Source routing [RFC0791]- each of multiple paths is specified in
      IP headers as a sequence of relaying OLSRv2 routers' addresses of
      packets being forwarded along this path.  Each router on the path
      forwards the packet according to this data as long as this data is
      not outdated due to network topology changes.  If used with a
      route recovery scheme such as the one described in Section 6.1, a
      node should compare the old source route with the new, recomputed
      source route (after having performed route recovery).  If the new
      route contains nodes that were already traversed with the old
      route before reaching the recomputing node, a loop is detected.

   Tuples obtained as a result of the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
   execution on the modified topology.  Table 4 and Table 5 present the
   analogous information for the cases of routers (3) and (4) taken as
   investigated Next-hops, respectively.  Table 6 presents the final
   Routing Set for router (1).

   Column names in tables are equivalents of the elements in the OLSRv2
   Routing Set (R_dest_addr, R_next_iface_addr, R_local_iface_addr,

           Figure 2: Network Topology for the on-demand example

   The initial cost of all the links is set to 1.  The incremental
   functions fp and fe are defined as fp(c)=4c and fe(c)=2c in this
   example.  Two routes from node 1 to node 5 are demanded.

   On the first run of the Dijkstra algorithm, the shortest path 1->2->5
   is obtained.

   The incremental function fp is applied to increase the cost of the
   link 1-2 and 2-5, from 1 to 4. fe is applied to increase the cost of
   the link 1-3, 2-3, 2-4, 4-5, from 1 to 2.

   On the second run of the Dijkstra algorithm, the second path
   1->3->4->5 is obtained.

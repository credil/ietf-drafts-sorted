      This document describes what it means to say that a Domain Name
      (DNS name) is reserved for special use, when reserving such a name is
      appropriate, and the procedure for doing so. It establishes an IANA
      registry for such domain names, and seeds it with entries for some
      of the already-established special domain names.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      Certain individual IP addresses and IP address ranges
      are treated specially by network implementations, and
      consequently are not suitable for use as unicast addresses.
      For example, IPv4 addresses 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 are
      multicast addresses <xref target="RFC5735"/>,
      with 224.0.0.1 being the "all hosts" multicast address
      <xref target="RFC1112"/> <xref target="RFC5771"/>.
      Another example is 127.0.0.1, the IPv4 "local host" address
      <xref target="RFC5735"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      Analogous to Special-Use IPv4 Addresses <xref target="RFC5735"/>,
      The Domain Name System (DNS) <xref target="RFC1034"/><xref target="RFC1035"/>
      has its own concept of reserved names, such as "example.com.",
      "example.net.", and "example.org.", or any name falling under the
      top level pseudo-domain "invalid." <xref target="RFC2606"/>.
      However, "Reserved Top Level DNS Names" <xref target="RFC2606"/>
      does not state whether implementations are expected to treat such
      names differently, and if so, in what way.
      </t>

      <t>
      This document specifies under what circumstances special treatment
      is appropriate, and in what ways.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in
      <xref target="RFC2119">"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability">
      <t>
      When IP multicast was created <xref target="RFC1112"/>,
      implementations had to be updated to understand what an IP multicast
      address means and what to do with it. Adding IP multicast to a
      networking stack entailed more than merely adding the right
      routing table entries for those addresses. Moreover, supporting IP
      multicast entails some level of commonality that is consistent
      across all conformant hosts, independent of what networks those
      hosts may be connected to. While it is possible to build a private
      isolated network using whatever valid unicast IP addresses and
      routing topology you choose (regardless of whether those unicast
      IP addresses are already in use by other hosts on the public Internet)
      the IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.1 is always the "all hosts"
      multicast address, and that's not a local decision.
      </t>

      <t>
      Similarly, if a domain name has special properties that affect the
      way hardware and software implementations handle the name, which apply
      universally regardless of what network the implementation may be
      connected to, then that may be a candidate for having the
      IETF declare the name to be a Special-Use Domain Name and specify
      what special treatment implementations should give to that name.
      On the other hand, if declaring a given name to be special would result in no change
      to any implementations, then that suggests that the name may not be
      special in any material way, and it may be more appropriate to use
      the existing DNS mechanisms <xref target="RFC1034"/> to provide
      the desired delegation, data, or lack-of-data, for the name in question.
      Where the desired behaviour can be achieved via the existing
      domain name registration processes, that process should be used.
      Reservation of a Special-Use Domain Name is not a mechanism for
      circumventing normal domain name registration processes.
      </t>

      <t>
      As an example,
      suppose there were to be an IETF document specifying that a particular name
      (or set of names) is guaranteed to produce an NXDOMAIN
      ("Name Error" <xref target="RFC1035"/>) result. Such a document falls within
      the responsibilites of the IETF. The IETF is responsible for protocol rules.
      The IETF defines name character set, length limits, syntax, the fact that in
      DNS "A" is equivalent to "a", etc. <xref target="RFC1034"/><xref target="RFC1035"/>.
      Portions of the namespace created by those
      rules are given to ICANN to manage, but due to existing DNS protocol rules
      ICANN is not free to allocate "COM" and "com" to two different name servers. The IETF
      has responsibility for specifying how the DNS protocol works, and ICANN is
      responsible for allocating the names made possible by that DNS protocol.
      Now, suppose a developer were to use this special "guaranteed nonexistent" name,
      "knowing" that it's guaranteed to return NXDOMAIN, and suppose also that the
      user's DNS server does not return NXDOMAIN for this name. The developer's
      software then fails. Who do the user and/or developer complain to? ICANN?
      The IETF? The DNS server operator? If the developer can't depend on the special
      "guaranteed nonexistent" name to always return NXDOMAIN then the special name
      is worthless, because it can't be relied on to do what it is supposed to.
      For this special "guaranteed nonexistent" name to have any use, it has to be
      defined to return NXDOMAIN, BY PROTOCOL, for all installations, not just by ICANN
      allocation on the public Internet. ICANN has no jurisdiction over how users
      choose to configure their own private DNS servers on their own private networks,
      but developers need a protocol specification that states that returning answers for the
      special "guaranteed nonexistent" name is a protocol violation on *all*
      networks, not just the public Internet. Hence definition of such a special name
      would be a higher-level protocol rule, above ICANN's management of allocable
      names on the public Internet.

    <section title="Procedure">
      <t>
      If it is determined that special handling of a name is required
      in order to implement some desired new functionality, then an
      IETF "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval"
      specification <xref target="RFC5226"/> MUST
      be published describing the new functionality, and:
      <list style='hanging' hangIndent="3">
        <t hangText=" o">The specification needs to state how
        implementations determine that the special handling
        is required for any given name. This is typically done by stating
        that any fully-qualified domain names ending in a certain suffix
        (i.e. falling within a specified parent pseudo-domain)
        will receive the special behaviour. In effect this carves off
        a sub-tree of the DNS namespace in which the modified name
        treatment rules apply, analogous to how IP multicast
        <xref target="RFC1112"/> or IP link-local addresses
        <xref target="RFC3927"/> <xref target="RFC4862"/> carve off chunks
        of the IP address space in which their respective modified address
        treatment rules apply.</t>
        <t hangText=" o">The specification needs to state, in each of
        the seven categories below, what special treatment, if any, is
        to be applied. If the answer in all seven categories is "none",
        then possibly no special treatment is required and requesting
        reservation of a Special-Use Domain Name may not be appropriate.</t>

    <section title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations">
      <t>
      An IETF "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval"
      document specifying some new naming behaviour,
      which requires a Special-Use Domain Name be reserved to implement this
      desired new behaviour, needs to contain a subsection of the "IANA Considerations" section
      entitled "Domain Name Reservation Considerations" giving answers in the seven
      categories listed below. In the case of algorithmically generated
      DNS names, the specifying document needs to clearly identify the set of names
      generated by the algorithm which would require the proposed special treatment.

        Do DNS server operators need to know about that and understand why?

        requests be allowed, but only to a specially-designated entity?
        (For example, the name "www.example.org" is reserved for
        documentation examples and is not available for registration;
        however, the name is in fact registered; and there is even a
        web site at that name, which states circularly that the name is

      <section title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations for &quot;invalid.&quot;">
        <t>
        The domain "invalid.", and any names falling within ".invalid.",
        are special in the ways listed below. In the text below, the term "invalid" is
        used in quotes to signify such names, as opposed to names that may be
        invalid for other reasons (e.g. being too long).

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Users are free to use "invalid" names as they would any
          other domain names. Users MAY assume that queries for "invalid" names
          will always return NXDOMAIN responses.</t>

          <t>Application software MAY recognize "invalid" names as special,
          or MAY pass them to name resolution APIs as they would for other
          domain names.</t>

          <t>Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD recognize "invalid"
          names as special and SHOULD always return immediate negative responses.
          Name resolution APIs SHOULD NOT send queries for "invalid" names to their
          configured caching DNS server(s).</t>

          <t>Caching DNS servers SHOULD recognize "invalid" names as special and
          SHOULD NOT attempt to look up NS records for them, or otherwise query
          authoritative DNS servers in an attempt to resolve "invalid" names.
          Instead, caching DNS servers SHOULD generate immediate NXDOMAIN responses
          for all such queries.
          This is to avoid unnecessary load on the root name servers and other
          name servers.</t>

          <t>Authoritative DNS servers SHOULD recognize "invalid" names as special
          and handle them as described above for caching DNS servers.</t>

          <t>DNS server operators SHOULD be aware that the effective RDATA for
          "invalid" names is defined by protocol specification to be nonexistent,
          and cannot be modified by local configuration.</t>

          <t>DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register "invalid" names
          in the normal way to any person or entity. These "invalid" names are
          defined by protocol specification to be nonexistent, and fall outside
          the set of names available for allocation by registries/registrars.
          Attempting to allocate a "invalid" name as if it were a normal
          DNS domain name will probably not work as desired,
          for reasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 above.</t>

      <section title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations for Example Domains">
        <t>
        The domains "example.", "example.com.", "example.net.", "example.org.",
        and any names falling within those domains, are special in the following ways:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Users SHOULD understand that example names are reserved for use in
          documentation.</t>

          <t>Application software SHOULD NOT recognize example names as special,
          and SHOULD use example names as they would other domain names.</t>

          <t>Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD NOT recognize example
          names as special and SHOULD NOT treat them differently. Name
          resolution APIs SHOULD send queries for example names to their
          configured caching DNS server(s).</t>

          <t>Caching DNS servers SHOULD NOT recognize example names as special and
          SHOULD resolve them normally.</t>

          <t>Authoritative DNS servers SHOULD NOT recognize example names as special.</t>

          <t>DNS server operators SHOULD be aware that example names are
          reserved for use in documentation.</t>

          <t>DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register example names
          in the normal way to any person or entity. All example names are registered
          in perpetuity to IANA:

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
      This document outlines the circumstances in which reserving a
      domain name for special-use is appropriate, and the procedure for
      having that Special-Use Domain Name recorded by IANA. Any document
      requesting such a Special-Use Domain Name needs to contain
      an appropriate "Security Considerations" section which describes
      any security issues relevant to that special use.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
      IANA needs to create a new registry of Special-Use Domain Names,
      initially populated with the private-address reverse-mapping domains
      and the Reserved Top Level DNS Names outlined above in <xref target="Initial"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      When IANA receives a request to record a new "Special-Use Domain Name"
      it should verify, in consultation with the IESG,
      that the IETF "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval" document
      <xref target="RFC5226"/> includes the required "Domain Name
      Reservation Considerations" section stating how the special
      meaning of this name affects the behaviour of hardware, software,
      and humans in the seven categories. If IANA and the IESG determine
      that special handling of this "Special-Use Domain Name" is
      appropriate, IANA should record the Special-Use Domain Name, and
      a reference to the specification that documents, it in the registry.

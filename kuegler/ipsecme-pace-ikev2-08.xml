IKEv2 does not allow secure peer authentication when using short credential strings, i.e. passwords. Several proposals have been made to
integrate password-authentication protocols into IKE.
This document provides an adaptation of PACE (Password Authenticated Connection Establishment) to the setting of IKEv2
and demonstrates the advantages of this integration.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
PACE <xref target="TR03110"/> is a security protocol that establishes a mutually authenticated (and encrypted) channel between two parties based on weak (short) passwords. PACE provides strong session keys that are independent of the strength of the password. 
PACE belongs to a family of protocols often referred to as Zero-Knowledge Password Proof
(ZKPP) protocols, all of which amplify weak passwords into strong session keys.
This draft describes the integration of PACE into IKEv2 <xref target="RFC5996"/> as a new authentication mode, analogous to the existing certificate and PSK authentication modes.
</t><t>
Some of the advantages of our approach, compared to the existing IKEv2, include:
<list style="symbols">
<t>The current best practice to implement password authentication in IKE involves certificate-based authentication of the server plus
some EAP method to authenticate the client. This involves two non-trivial infrastructure components (PKI and EAP/AAA). Moreover,
certificate authentication is hard to get right, and often depends for its security on unreliable user behavior.</t>
<t>Alternatively, native IKEv2 shared secret authentication can be used with passwords. This usage however is insecure, specifically
it is vulnerable to active attackers.</t>
<t>Some newer EAP methods can be used for mutual authentication,
and combined with <xref target="RFC5998"/> can be well integrated into IKEv2.
This is certainly an option in some cases, but the current proposal may be simpler to implement.</t>
</list>
Compared to other protocols aiming at similar goals, PACE has several advantages. PACE was designed to be free of patents, and to allow for a high level of flexibility with respect to cryptographic algorithms, e.g. it can be implemented based on standard Diffie-Hellman as well as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman without any restrictions on the mathematical group to be used other than the requirement that the group is cryptographically secure. The protocol itself is also proven to be cryptographically secure <xref target="PACEsec"/>. The PACE protocol is currently used in an international standard for digital travel documents <xref target="ICAO"/>.
</t><t>
The integration aims at keeping as much as possible of IKEv2 unchanged,
e.g. the mechanisms used to establish Child SAs as provided by IKEv2 are maintained with no change. 
</t>
<t>The PAKE Framework document <xref target='I-D.kivinen-ipsecme-secure-password-framework'/> defines a set of payloads for different types of PAKE
methods within IKEv2. This document reuses this framework. Note that the current document is self-contained, i.e. all relevant payloads and semantics are redefined here.</t>
<section title="Terminology">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

<section title="Overview">
<t>

At a high level the following steps are performed by the initiator and the responder.
They result in a two-round IKE_AUTH exchange, described in <xref target="sequence"/> below.
<list style="numbers">
<t>
The initiator randomly and uniformly chooses a nonce, encrypts the nonce using the password,
and sends the ciphertext ENONCE to the responder.
</t><t>
The responder recovers the plaintext nonce with the help of the shared password Pwd.
</t><t>
The initiator and the responder perform the following steps:
<list style="letters">
<t>A mapping function Map() is used to derive an ephemeral generator GE = Map(G,s) from
the exchanged nonce s and the generator G of the used group. 
</t><t>They perform an anonymous Diffie-Hellman key agreement based on the ephemeral generator
and compute the shared secret PACESharedSecret.
</t><t>
They generate, exchange, and verify the authentication token AUTH using the shared secret PACESharedSecret.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>To avoid the risks inherent in storing a short password (e.g. the fact that passwords are often reused for
different applications), this protocol allows the peers to jointly convert the password into a cryptographically
stronger shared secret.</t>
</section>
<!-- *************************************************************************************** -->
<section anchor="sequence" title="Protocol Sequence">
<t>
The protocol consists of three round trips, IKE_SA_INIT, and a 2-round IKE_AUTH exchange,
as shown in the next figure.
An optional Informational exchange may follow (see <xref target='persist-psk'/>).

<section title="The IKE_SA_INIT Exchange">
<t>
The initiator sends a SECURE_PASSWORD_METHODS notification that indicates its support of this extension,
and its wish to authenticate using a password. The following text assumes that the responder
sent back a SECURE_PASSWORD_METHODS notification that indicates its preference for PACE.
</t><t>
If PACE was chosen, the algorithms negotiated in SAi1 and SAr1 are also used for the execution of PACE,
i.e. the key agreement protocol (standard Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman),
the group to be used, and the encryption algorithm.
</t>
</section>
<section title="The IKE_AUTH Exchange, Round #1">
<t>This is the first part of the PACE authentication of the peers.
This exchange MUST NOT be used unless both peers indicated support of this protocol.
</t>
<t>
The initiator selects a random nonce s and encrypts it to form ENONCE using the password Pwd, as described in <xref target="encryption"/>. Then the initiator maps the nonce to an ephemeral generator GE of the group as described in <xref target="mapping"/>, chooses randomly and uniformly an ephemeral key pair (SKEi,PKEi) based on the ephemeral generator and finally generates the payloads GSPM(ENONCE) containing the encrypted nonce and KEi2 containing the ephemeral public key.
</t><t>
The responder decrypts the received encrypted nonce s = D(KPwd, ENONCE), performs the mapping and randomly and uniformly chooses an ephemeral key pair (SKEr,PKEr) based on the ephemeral generator GE. The responder generates the KEr2 payload containing the ephemeral public key.
</t><t>
During the Diffie-Hellman key agreement, each party MUST check that the two public keys PKEi and PKEr differ. Otherwise,
it MUST abort the protocol.
</t>
<t>The request is equivalent to the IKE_AUTH request in a normal IKEv2 exchange,
i.e. any payload which is valid in an IKE_AUTH request
is valid (with the same semantics) in this round's request. In particular,
certificate-related payloads are allowed, even though their use may not be practical
within this mode.</t>
</section>
<section title="The IKE_AUTH Exchange, Round #2">
<t>This is the second part of the PACE authentication of the peers.</t>
<t>
The initiator and the responder calculate the shared secret PACESharedSecret:
</t><t>
<list>
<t>PACESharedSecret = KA(SKEi, PKEr, GE) = KA(SKEr, PKEi, GE),</t>
</list>
</t><t>
where KA denotes the Diffie-Hellman key agreement, e.g. (for MODP groups) modular exponentiation.
Then they calculate the authentication tokens AUTHi and AUTHr.
</t><t>
The initiator calculates:
</t><t>
<list style="empty">
<t>
AUTHi = prf(prf+(Ni | Nr, PACESharedSecret), &lt;InitiatorSignedOctets&gt; | PKEr) 
</t>
</list>
</t><t>
See Sec. 2.15 of <xref target="RFC5996"/> for the definition of signed octets.
</t><t>
The responder calculates:
</t><t>
<list style="empty">
<t>
AUTHr = prf(prf+(Ni | Nr, PACESharedSecret), &lt;ResponderSignedOctets&gt; | PKEi) 
</t>
</list>
</t><t>
Both AUTH payloads MUST indicate the Secure Password Authentication Method <xref target="I-D.kivinen-ipsecme-secure-password-framework"/>,
whose value is TBD by IANA.
The authentication tokens are exchanged and each of them MUST be verified by the other party.
The behavior when this verification fails is unchanged from <xref target="RFC5996"/>.
</t>
<t>Each of the peers MAY generate a long term credential at this point, after it has verified the opposite peer's identity.
The shared secret is:</t>
<t>
<list style="empty">
<t>
LongTermSecret = prf(Ni | Nr, "PACE Generated PSK" | PACESharedSecret)
</t>
</list>
where the literal string is ASCII-encoded, with no zero terminator. 
The generated secret MUST be persisted to stable memory before sending the response.
See <xref target='persist-psk'/>
for more details about this facility.
</t>
<t>This round's response is equivalent to the IKE_AUTH response in a normal IKEv2 exchange,
i.e. any payload which is valid in an IKE_AUTH response
is valid (with the same semantics) in the second round's response.</t>
<t>Following authentication, all temporary values MUST be deleted by the peers, including in particular
s, the ephemeral generator, the ephemeral key pairs, and PACESharedSecret.</t>
</section>
<section anchor='persist-psk' title="Creating a Long Term Shared Secret">
<t>
To reduce the time that the peers store a hashed password, it is RECOMMENDED to
replace the password by a dedicated shared secret, according to the method described in this section. See <xref target="salting"/>
for more discussion of the security threats involved.
</t>
<t>Both peers generate the value LongTermSecret during round #2 of IKE_AUTH, as shown above. Later on,
they exchange a PERSIST_PSK notification. Assume both peers support this mechanism, e.g. the IKE implementation
is able to modify its own credential store. Then each of the peers, when receiving the notification, permanently deletes the stored
password and replaces it with LongTermSecret.
These credentials are stored in the Peer Authorization Database (PAD) <xref target="RFC4301"/>
and are associated with the identity of the opposite peer.
</t>
<t>This solution is designed as a two-phase commitment, so that failure at any time cannot result in the peers not
having any shared secret.</t>

<t>
In the second round of IKE_AUTH, the initiator MAY send a PSK_PERSIST notification if it wishes to use this
mechanism. If the responder agrees, and only after it has authenicated the initiator, it MUST generate a new PSK store it to stable storage (e.g. to disk), and MUST
respond with a PSK_PERSIST notification.
Otherwise it simply does not include the notification
in its reply. When receiving the reply, and after authenticating the responder,
the initiator MUST also generate the PSK and save it in stable storage.
</t>
<t>
If the peers have negotiated this mechanism, the initiator MUST send the PSK_CONFIRM notification
in an Informational exchange shortly after the IKE SA has been set up.
When the responder receives it, it MUST delete the stored short password from its credential database, and respond
with a PSK_CONFIRM notification. Upon receiving this notification, the initiator deletes its copy of the short password.
</t>
<t>If not saved to persistent storage, the LongTermSecret MUST be deleted when the IKE SA is rekeyed or when it is torn down.
It SHOULD be deleted 1 hour after the initial IKE SA has been set up.</t>
</section>
<section title="Using the Long Term Shared Secret">
<t>The LongTermSecret MUST be used as a regular IKE PSK, rather than with PACE or any other password-based
authentication method.</t>
<t>Normally at the completion of this protocol, both peers will have either a shared password or a shared PSK.
The protocol is designed so that the peers will
have a shared credential, regardless of any protocol failures. However in some failure cases, the initiator may find itself with both
a short password and a PSK for a particular peer. In that case, it MUST first try to authenticate with a password, and upon success, MUST attempt to convert it to a PSK. If password authentication fails, it MUST use the PSK and upon successful setup of the IKE SA, MUST permanently delete the password.</t>

<section anchor="nonce" title="Encrypting and Mapping the Nonce">
<section anchor="encryption" title="Encrypting the Nonce">
<t>
The shared password is not used as-is. Instead, it SHOULD be converted into a "stored password" SPwd,
so that the plaintext password does not need to be stored for long periods. SPwd is defined as:
</t><t>
<list style="empty"><t>
SPwd = prf("IKE with PACE", Pwd)
</t></list>
</t><t>
where the literal string consists of ASCII characters with no zero terminator. If the negotiated prf requires a fixed-size key, the literal string is either truncated or padded with
zero octets on the right, as needed.
</t><t>
<list style="empty"><t>
KPwd = prf+(Ni | Nr, SPwd)
</t></list>
</t><t>
where Ni and Nr are the regular IKE nonces, stripped of any headers. 
If the negotiated prf takes a fixed-length key and the lengths of Ni and Nr do not add up to that length,
half the bits must come from Ni and half from Nr, taking the first bits of each.
"prf+" is defined in Sec. 2.13 of <xref target="RFC5996"/>.
The length of KPwd is determined by the key length of the negotiated encryption algorithm.
</t><t>
A nonce s is randomly selected by the initiator (see <xref target="randomness"/> for additional
considerations).  The length of s MUST be exactly 32 octets.
</t><t>
Note: Padding MUST NOT be used when encrypting the nonce. The size of the nonce 
has been chosen such that it can be encrypted with block ciphers having block 
sizes of 32, 64, and 128 bit without any padding. 
</t><t>
If an authenticated encryption cipher <xref target="RFC5282"/> has been negotiated for the IKE SA,
it MUST NOT be used as-is because such use would be vulnerable to dictionary 
attacks. Instead, the corresponding unauthenticated mode MUST be used. All GCM and all CCM encryption algorithms
are mapped to the corresponding counter-mode algorithm. For 
example, if the negotiated encryption algorithm (Transform Type 1) 
is "AES-GCM with a 8 octet ICV", then ENCR_AES_CTR (with the same key length) is used to encrypt 
the nonce. If such a mapping does not exist for a particular cipher, then it MUST NOT be used within the current protocol.
</t><t>
KPwd is now used with the encryption transform to encrypt the nonce:
</t><t>
<list style="empty"><t>
ENONCE = E(KPwd, s) 
</t></list>
</t><t>
If an Initialization Vector (IV) is required by the cipher, it MUST be included in the GSPM(ENONCE) payload. It is RECOMMENDED to choose the IV randomly and uniformly distributed, even though this condition is not necessary for the cryptographic security of the protocol.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="mapping" title="Mapping the Nonce">
<t>
The mapping is based on a second anonymous Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol to create a shared
secret which is used together with the exchanged nonce to calculate a common secret generator of the group.
</t><t>
While in <xref target="TR03110"/> the generation of the shared secret is part of the mapping,
in the setting of IKEv2 a shared secret SASharedSecret has already been generated as part of the IKE_SA_INIT step.
Using the notation of <xref target="RFC5996"/>,
</t><t>
<list style="empty">
<t>SASharedSecret = g^ir</t>

Let G and GE be the generator of the negotiated DH group, and the calculated ephemeral generator, respectively. The following subsections describe the mapping for different Diffie-Hellman variants.
</t>
<section title="MODP Diffie-Hellman">
<t>
The function Map:G->GE is defined as GE = G^s * SASharedSecret.
</t><t>
Note that the protocol will fail if G^s = 1/SASharedSecret. If s is chosen randomly, this event occurs with negligible probability. In implementations that detect such a failure, the initiator SHOULD choose s again.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman">
<t>
The function Map:G->GE is defined as GE = s*G + SASharedSecret.
</t><t>
Note that the protocol will fail if s*G = -SharedSecret. If s is chosen randomly, this event occurs with negligible probability. In implementations that detect such a failure, the initiator SHOULD choose s again.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Validation">
<t>
Implementations MUST verify that the shared secrets SASharedSecret and PACESharedSecret are elements of the group generated by G to prevent small subgroup attacks.
</t><t>
It is RECOMMENDED to use the public key validation method or the compatible cofactor exponentiation described in Section 3.1 and Section 3.4, respectively, of <xref target="RFC2785"/>. The Elliptic Curve equivalents of those methods are described in more detail in <xref target="TR03111"/>.

<t>See <xref target="encryption"/> for further details about the encrypted nonce. Note
that the protocol, and in particular this payload's format,
does not support any padding of the encrypted data.</t>
<t>The PACE-RESERVED field must be sent as zero, and must be rejected
by the receiver if it is not 0.</t>
</section>
<section title="The KE (KEi2/KEr2) Payloads in PACE">
<t>PACE reuses the KE payload for its Diffie-Hellman exchange, with the new payloads 
being sent within the IKE_AUTH exchange. 
Since only one Diffie-Hellman group is negotiated, the group denoted by these payloads MUST be identical
to the one used in the "regular" KE payloads in IKE_SA_INIT.</t>
</section>
<section title="PACE and Session Resumption">
<t>A session resumption <xref target="RFC5723"/> ticket may be requested during the IKE_AUTH exchange.
The request MUST be sent in the request of the first round, and any response MUST be sent in the response of the second one.</t>
<t>PACE should be considered an "authentication method", in the sense of Sec. 5 of <xref target="RFC5723"/>,
which means that its use MUST be noted in the protected ticket. The format of the ticket is not standardized, however
we RECOMMEND that this indication should distinguish between the different secure password authentication
methods defined for IKE.</t>
<t>Note that even if the initial authentication used PACE and its extended IKE_AUTH, session resumption will still
include the normal IKE_AUTH exchange.</t>
</section>
</section>
<!-- *************************************************************************************** -->
<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>A major goal of this protocol has been to maintain the level of security provided by IKEv2. What follows
is an analysis of this protocol. The reader is referred to <xref target="RFC5996"/>
for the generic IKEv2 security considerations.</t>
<section title="Credential Security Assumptions">
<t>This protocol makes no assumption on the strength of the shared credential.
Best common practices regarding minimal password length, use of multiple character classes etc. SHOULD be followed.</t>
</section>
<section title="Vulnerability to Passive and Active Attacks">
<t>The protocol is secure against both passive and active attackers. See <xref target="security-proof"/> for a security proof.
</t><t>
While not attacking the cryptography, an attacker can still perform a standard password guessing attack.
To mitigate such attacks, an implementation MUST include standard protections,
such as rate limiting the number of allowed password guessing attempts, possibly locking identities out
after a certain number of failed attempts etc. Note that the protocol is symmetric
and therefore this guidance applies to client-side implementations as well.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Perfect Forward Secrecy">
<t>The key derivation for the IKE SA and any Child SAs is performed as part of IKEv2 and remains unchanged. It directly follows that perfect forward security is provided independent of the authentication additionally performed by PACE.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="randomness" title="Randomness">
<t>The security of this protocol depends on the quality generation of random quantities, and see Sec. 5
of <xref target="RFC5996"/> for more details. Specifically, any deviation from randomness of the nonce s
might compromise the password. Therefore, it is strongly RECOMMENDED
that the initiator passes the raw random material through a strong prf
to ensure the statistical qualities of the nonce.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Identity Protection">
<t>This protocol is identical to IKEv2 in the quality of identity protection it provides.
Both peers' identities are secure from passive attackers, and both peers' identities are exposed to active,
man-in-the-middle attackers.</t>
</section>
<section title="Denial of Service">
<t>We are not aware of any new denial-of-service attack vector enabled by this protocol. </t>
</section>
<section title="Choice of Encryption Algorithms">
<t>Any transforms negotiated for IKEv2 may be used by this protocol. Please refer to <xref target="encryption"/>
for the considerations regarding authenticated encryption ("combined mode") algorithms.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="security-proof" title="Security Model and Security Proof">
<t>
PACE is cryptographically proven secure in <xref target="PACEsec"/> in the model of Bellare, Pointcheval, and Rogaway <xref target="BPRmodel"/>.
The setting in which PACE is proven secure is however slightly different from the setting used in IKEv2. The differences are described in the following:

<list style="symbols">
	<t>Part of the mapping is already performed within IKEv2 before PACE is started. This rearrangement does not affect the proof as the resulting PACESharedSecret remains close to uniformly distributed in the group generated by G.</t>
	<t>The keys for the IKE SA and any Child SAs are already generated within IKEv2 before PACE is started. While those session keys could also be derived in PACE, only the keys for the authentication token are considered in the proof, which explicitly recommends a separate key for this purpose.</t>	
	<t>IKEv2 allows the negotiation of a stream cipher for PACE while the proven variant always uses a block cipher. The ideal cipher is replaced in the proof by lazy-sampling technique which is similarly applicable to the stream cipher based construction.</t>	
</list>	
The differences in the setting therefore have no impact on the validity of the proof.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Long-Term Credential Storage">
<t>
This protocol does not require peers to store the plaintext password. Instead, the value SPwd SHOULD be stored by both peers.
</t><t>
In addition, the protocol allows both peers to replace the password by a crypto-strength shared secret.
This solution improves the system's security (since passwords are often used for multiple applications), but
at the cost of implementation complexity. In particular, if this optional mechanism is to be used,
the credential database would need to be writable by the key management subsystem.
</t>
<t>
See <xref target="salting"/> for alternatives to this approach.

<section title="Password Salting" anchor="salting">
<t>This protocol requires that passwords should not be stored in plaintext. Instead,
we store a hash of the password with a fixed hash. This value is then used in the ZKPP protocol,
replacing the original password and acting as a "password equivalent". The main benefit of this solution is
that a system administrator or an undetermined attacker does not get immediate access to the passwords.
We believe this is sufficiently secure for the main usage scenario of the protocol.</t>
<t>However the common practice of password salting is clearly more powerful, and this appendix presents a few ideas
on how password salting can be applied and/or adopted to fit into a symmetric protocol such as IKE. First, let us list
the threats that we expect salting to handle, as well as the non-threats:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>The plain password should not be visible to a casual onlooker, as noted above. It is assumed that
very often the same password is used for multiple applications, and so a password exposed allows an attacker
a starting point for further attacks.</t>
<t>An attacker must not be able to construct lookup tables (such as the famous "rainbow tables") that enable her to discover the
plain password.</t>
<t>IKE is a symmetric protocol, in the sense that any of the peers might initiate an IKE exchange to another peer.
As a result all peers must have stored credentials (passwords or password equivalents) that would enable
them to set up an IKE exchange. So an attacker that reaches the credential store would in fact be able to impersonate
IKE to another peer. We believe that this reduces, but does not invalidate the importance of salting, because of the other threats that remain.</t>
</list>
Below we present different scenarios and solutions that support password salting in this setting.
</t>
<t>We assume that each credential is used to authenticate exactly two peers to one another, i.e.
(as per the best practice) group credentials are not allowed.</t>
<section title="Solving the Asymmetric Case with Symmetric Cryptography">
<t>Despite the protocol's symmetry, there are use cases that are somewhat asymmetric. Consider the
case of an organization that consists of a headquarters and branches, using a hub-and-spoke architecture.
Communication sessions can be initiated by the center or by any of the branches, but only the center holds a
large credential database.</t>
<t>Here it would be possible to use traditional password salting,
<list style="empty">
<t> stored password = hash(salt, password), </t>
</list>
where the hash function is a symmetric hash (e.g. HMAC-SHA-256), and the salt is picked at random for each password.
The salt would need to be sent in the first exchange of the protocol, regardless of which side initiates the session. Unlike the normal use of
salted passwords, here it is the stored password, rather than the original password, that is used by the follow-on ZKPP protocol.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Solving the Fully Symmetric Case with Asymmetric Cryptography">
<t>For the fully symmetric case, we propose a salting method based on a commutative one-way function.
This is essentially a novel variant of the RSA protocol. </t>
<t>
The implementation proposed here requires a composite number n that is common to all peers.
The composite number n can be either generated by a trusted (third) 
party as n = p * q, where p and q are strong primes (i.e. p = 2 * p' + 1 
and q = 2 * q' + 1, where p' and q' are also primes), and the trusted party promises
not to retain a copy of the primes. Alternatively, n can be 
chosen randomly and tested for "small" prime factors. In the latter 
case it is certainly not guaranteed that n is composed of only two primes.
While this has the advantage that no one knows the factorization of n,
the disadvantage is that n is likely to be significantly easier to factor.</t>
<t>
Each peer then chooses a public encryption key e. In a simple implementation
the encryption key is generated randomly by each peer, picking a different value 
for each of the passwords that it stores. </t>
<t>
Note that although the pair (n,e) is similar to an RSA public key, the usual 
rules for generating "e" for the RSA protocol do not apply here, and a 
random "e" is sufficient. 
The password is hashed by a symmetric hash function H (e.g. SHA-256). Each peer i stores the two values
<list style="empty">
<t>e_i, H(P)^e_i (mod n)</t>
</list>
where P is the original password. The values e_i are exchanged by the peers before the ZKPP protocol commences (in IKEv2-PACE, this would be in IKE_SA_INIT)
and the following value is used in the ZKPP protocol run that follows, in lieu of the original password:
<list style="empty">
<t>H(P) ^ (e_i * e_j) (mod n).</t>
</list>
This transformation is used as a salting mechanism only and the salted values themselves are never sent on the wire.
</t>
<t>This scheme can be enhanced by basing the value "e" on each peer's identity (IDi, IDr),
e.g. making it a simple hash of the identity. This eliminates the need to send "e" explicitly, and additionally binds the
identity of the peer with its secret. </t>
</section>
<section anchor="long-secret" title="Generation of a Long Shared Secret">
<t>An alternative to salting is to store the plain passwords, but only for a short while. As soon as the first IKE SA is set up between two peers, the peers exchange nonces
and generate a long shared secret, based on IKE's SK_d. They now destroy the short password and replace it with the new secret.</t>
<t>This method has been added to the current protocol, as an optional mechanism.</t>

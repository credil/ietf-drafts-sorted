  <abstract>
    <t>The IPsecME working group was chartered to provide IKEv2 a
    symmetric secure password authentication protocol that supports
    using of low-entropy shared secrets, but which is protected
    against off-line dictionary attacks without requiring the use of
    certificates of EAP. There are multiple of such methods and
    working group was supposed to pick one. Unfortunately the working
    group failed to get pick one protocol and there are multiple
    candidates going forward as separate documents. As each of those
    documents uses different method to negotiate the use of the method
    and also uses different payload formats it is very hard to try to
    make implementation where multiple of those systems could
    co-exists.</t>

    <t>This document tries to create generic way for those methods to
    negotiate which one is used and provides one new payload which can
    be used to transmit method specific data.</t>

  <section title='Introduction'>
    <t>This document does not create new protocol or even define a
    protocol which could be used to do anything. This document
    describes a payload formats for IKEv2 (<xref target='RFC5996'/>)
    which can be used for multiple secure password methods to do
    negotiation and transmit data so each different method can easily
    co-exists in the same implementation.</t>

    <t>This document consists of two major parts:
    
    <list style='symbols'>
      
      <t>How to negotiate which secure password
      method negotiation is used.</t>

      <t>How to transmit secure password method specific data between
      peers.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>The secure password methods are not usually meant to be used in
    the normal end user (remote access VPN) cases. In such cases the
    EAP based authentication works fine and the asymmetric nature of
    the EAP does not matter. In such scenarios the authentication is
    usually backed up with the back-end AAA-servers and other
    infrastructure. I.e. in such scenarios neither IKEv2 peers really
    knows the secret, in one end it is typed in by the user when it is
    needed, and on the other end it is authenticated by the back-end
    AAA-server.</t>

    <t>The new secure password methods are meant to be used in cases
    where such back-end AAA-infrastructure does not exists. An example
    of such case could be authentication between two servers or
    routers. These scenarios are usually symmetric: both peers know
    the shared secret, no back-end authentication servers are
    involved, and either end can initiate an IKEv2 connection.</t>

    <t>In many cases each implementation will only use only one of the
    proposed secure password authentication methods, but in many cases
    the implementations can include support for multiple methods even
    when only one of them will be used. For example general purpose
    operating system running IPsec and IKEv2 and supporting secure
    password authentication methods to protect services provided by
    the system, might need to implement support for several of the
    different methods, and it is going to be up to the adminstrator
    which one of them are going to be used. As the server might need
    to connect to multiple other servers, each implementing different
    set of methods, there might not be possible to pick one method
    that would be used in all cases.</t>

    <t>The secure password methods mostly keeps the existing IKEv2
    IKE_SA_INIT exchange and modify the IKE_AUTH authentication step.
    As those methods do not want to add new round trips that means the
    negotiation of which of the secure password methods to use needs
    to happen during the IKE_SA_INIT. As the identity of the other end
    is only provided inside the IKE_AUTH that means that the responder
    end needs to select the list of supported methods only based on
    the IP-address of the initiator. This could lead in to the
    problems if only certain methods would be acceptable for certain
    identified peers. Fortunately as the authentication is done based
    on the shared secret shared between both peers, that shared-secret
    should be usable in all of the methods, thus remote peer usually
    does not need to restrict selection of the method based on the
    initiators identity only based on the supported methods and
    adminstrative policy.</t>

    <t>Also as the initiator already knows to which peer it is
    connecting to it can limit which methods it uses for the other
    peer. And as secure password methods are meant to be used in the
    symmetric cases, both end should have similar configuration, i.e.
    they have same shared-secret, and most likely both also have list
    of acceptable (or exactly one acceptable) authentication method to
    be used. This could also be interpreted that there is no need to
    support method negotiation as both ends can already see this from
    configuration. On the other hand in most cases either end does not
    really care which of the method is used, they are willing to use
    any secure method other end supports. In such cases the automatic
    negotiation provides a way to make the configuration easy, i.e. no
    need to pick one method to be used between the peers.</t>

    <t>The reason for the common IKEv2 payload to be used to transmit
    secure password method specific data between peers is that the
    payload type field in the IKEv2 is only 8-bit field, and 62.5% of
    the range is already reserved (50% to the private use numbers, and
    12.5% to the IKEv1 payload numbers). This leaves 95 usable
    numbers, where 16 is already in use. The current secure password
    authentication methods already propose to consume five payload
    type numbers. This 6% of the unallocated number space is not that
    big on itself, but nothing says there will be only the current
    three protocols (<xref
    target='I-D.harkins-ipsecme-spsk-auth'/>, <xref
    target='I-D.kuegler-ipsecme-pace-ikev2'/>, and <xref
    target='I-D.shin-augmented-pake'/>), and those five new payload
    types would already be 31% increase to the number of currently
    allocated payload types.</t>

    -->
    
  </section>

  <section title='Method Negotiation'>

    <t>Because all of the methods modify the IKE_AUTH exchange, the
    negotiation of which secure password method is used needs to
    happen during the IKE_SA_INIT exchange. The proposed negotiation
    exchange would be:</t>

    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Initiator                         Responder
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    Flags: Initiator, Message ID=0),
    SAi1, KEi, Ni, [N(SECURE_PASSWORD_METHODS)]  -->

                   <--  HDR(SPIi=xxx, SPIr=yyy, IKE_SA_INIT,
                            Flags: Response, Message ID=0),
                            SAr1, KEr, Nr, [CERTREQ],
                            [N(SECURE_PASSWORD_METHODS)]
]]></artwork></figure>

    <t>If the N(SECURE_PASSWORD_METHODS) Notify Payload is missing
    then normal IKEv2 authentication methods are used. If the Notify
    Payload is included then the negotiation of the secure password
    methods happens inside those payloads. </t>

    <t>As it might be possible that the secure password method will
    modify the IKE_AUTH payload in more substantial way, it is better
    that as a end result of the negotiation we have exactly one secure
    password method which will be used. The initiator will know which
    methods are usable for him when talking to that responder, so
    initiator will send list of acceptable methods in its IKE_SA_INIT
    request. The responder will pick exactly one method and put that
    to its response.</t>

    <t>The secure password methods are identified by the 16-bit IANA
    allocated numbers stored in to the Notify Payload notification
    data field. If method supports multiple different password
    preprosessing methods each of those may be allocated a separate
    number from this space, or the method might do its own negotiation
    of the preprosessing method later. As initiator has already
    selected the shared secret it will be using it will also know
    which kind of preprossing might be needed for it, so it should
    propose only those preprosessing methods suitable for the selected
    shared secret. This means that allocating multiple IANA numbers
    for one secure password method one for each preprosessing method
    is recommended.</t>

    <t>The actual Notify Payload will look like this:</t>

  <section title='Generic Secure Password Method Payload'>

    <t>This payload will contain the secure password payload specific
    data. The IKE_AUTH exchanges might have multiple of these inside,
    depending what is required and specified by the secure password
    method selected. As the secure password method is already selected
    during the IKE_SA_INIT, there is no need to repeat the information
    of the selected secure password method anymore, thus this payload
    only contains the method specific data. As some secure password
    methods do require multiple different payloads they are assumed to
    include their method specific payload type inside the payload, for
    example inside the first octect of the data, but this is method
    specific, and method is free to format the payload data as it
    feels like.</t>

    <t>But this picture is here only for illustrative purposes, the
    secure password method will be defining the exact format of the
    payload contents.</t>

  </section> <!-- Generic Secure Password Method Payload -->

  <section title='IKE_AUTH Exchange'>

    <t>As the negotiation happens during the IKE_SA_INIT the secure
    password methods may modify the IKE_AUTH exchange if needed. To
    make implementing multiple methods easy it would be recommended
    that the IKE_AUTH exchange is not to be modified unnecessarely.
    Adding zero, one or multiple Generic Secure Password Method
    Payloads to each exchange is needed, as is the modification how
    the AUTH payload is calculated, but all other changes should be
    kept minimal. </t>

    <t>The IKE_AUTH exchange should look bit like EAP, meaning that
    the first request includes IDi, SAi2, TSi, TSr, and some number of
    GSPM payloads. The response to that should include IDr and again
    some number of GSPM payloads. There may be multiple exchanges each
    consisting of some number of GSPM payloads, and finally when
    authentication is done there should be one final exchange where
    the request includes the AUTH payload (along with some number of
    GSPM payloads) and the response contains AUTH, SAr2, TSi, TSr and
    some number of GSPM payloads. The number of GSPM payloads is up to
    the secure password method, but usually will less than 3, but it
    might be more depending on the method.</t>

    <t>The AUTH payload calculation should include all the same data
    that is normally included in addition to the extra data needed by
    the secure password method. The secure password method needs to
    define how the AUTH payload is calculated.</t>

    <t>As the AUTH payload calculation is changed the secure payload
    method should not use any of the existing authentication methods
    numbers in the AUTH Payload Auth Method field, but instead use the
    number allocated in this document. This number is meant to be used
    by all secure password authentication methods.</t>

Abstract

   BikINI is designed to allow multiple client computers to access a
   mail message store on a central server. It operates over any
   reliable datastream protocol, but is commonly used over TCP. BikINI
   is designed to require minimal message parsing by the server, to be
   8-bit clean for mail message content, and to be a lighter-weight and
   easier-to-implement than other remote message access protocols.

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010

1. Introduction

   The objective of BikINI is to provide a remote mail storage and
   access protocol which is easier to implement than [IMAP] and more
   suitable for remote storage of messages than [POP3]. To that end,
   multiple design decisions were made to keep the protocol as simple
   as possible.

1.1. Design Considerations

   Server-side message parsing is resource-intensive and complex, and
   thus should be avoided. This precludes functionality like retrieval
   of single parts of MIME multipart messages, but makes implementation
   significantly simpler and reduces the resource-intensiveness of the
   server.

   Case insensitivity is no longer a necessary feature, and adds code
   for little reason otherwise. BikINI is a new protocol and doesn't
   require it, therefore commands and responses in BikINI are
   case-sensitive. Clients MUST send commands in upper case; upper and
   lower case characters MAY appear in identifiers, paths, and flags.
   The server MAY include upper and lower case characters in message
   identifiers, response modifiers, and descriptive text responses.

   Allowing arbitrary runs of whitespace around commands and arguments
   is not necessary, and adds code to clients and servers for little
   purpose. BikINI clients and servers MUST NOT add padding of any type
   (including extra whitespace) to commands, arguments, or responses
   other than that explicitly stated in this protocol specification.

   High numbers of active clients must be supported. In particular, the
   immediate disconnect response modifier removes the need for large
   numbers of idle connections on such systems.

1.2. Terminology

   To minimize confusion, the following definitions hold throughout
   this document.

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   Lines are defined as a series of characters excluding <LF>, and
   terminated by <LF>.

   Characters are 7-bit US-ASCII unless otherwise specified.

   User refers to a human user.

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


   Client refers to the software being run by the user.

   Session refers to the entire sequence of client commands and server
   responses from the initial establishment of the network connection
   until its termination.

   The mail store is the top-level container accessed by a session.

   A directory is a container that contains zero or more directories,
   or zero or more mail folders, or both.

   A folder (or mail folder) is a container that contains zero or more
   messages.

   A message is arbitrary 8-bit data (servers and clients SHOULD store
   and send [RFC2822] and [RFC5322] email messages).

2. Requirement Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Protocol Overview

3.1. Link Level

   The BikINI protocol requires a reliable data stream as an underlying
   link level protocol. This may be TCP/IP or another protocol. When
   operating over TCP/IP, BikINI is frequently used on TCP port ???.

3.2. Commands and Responses

   A BikINI connection consists of the establishment of a client/server
   network connection, an initial greeting from the server, and client/
   server interactions. These client/server interactions consist of a
   client command, server data, and a server completion result
   response.

   All interactions transmitted by client and server are in the form of
   strings that end with <LF> and may not contain <LF>.

   When message content (either a complete message, or only the header
   portion of a message) is being transferred in either direction the
   interaction is 8-bit data. When the message is an [RFC2822] message
   (expected to be all of the time at time of deployment of this
   protocol), lines in an individual message are terminated with
   Unix-style <LF> only.

   The protocol receiver of a BikINI client or server is either reading
   a line, or is reading a sequence of octets with a known count
   followed by a line.

3.2.1. Client Protocol Sender and Server Protocol Receiver

   The client command begins an operation.

   There are two cases in which a line from the client does not
   represent a complete command. Those are when the client requires
   preliminary approval before completing the PUT operation, and when
   the client is authenticating via an AUTH method requiring an
   exchange of authentication tokens.

   In this case, the server sends a K reply indicating the client may
   proceed to send its message data or authentication token(s), or an
   A, E, U, or X reply indicating the command cannot be processed.

3.2.2. Server Protocol Sender and Client Protocol Receiver

   Data transmitted by the server to the client takes one of three
   forms.

   * single-line response

      + A single-character status code (A, E, K, U, or X),
        optionally followed by one or more single-character response
        modifiers, followed by a single space and optional text, and
        terminated with <LF>.

   * multi-line response

      + A multi-line response has zero or more + lines, each
        terminated with <LF>, followed by a K single-line response
        to indicate completion of the multi-line response. All
        multi- line responses are positive responses. Servers MUST
        NOT add response modifiers to the continuation + lines of a
        multiline response. All response modifiers on a multiline
        response must be added to the trailing K response line. Note
        that a multiline response with zero continuation lines is
        identical to a successful K single-line response.

   * message content response

      + A single-line K response, where the additional information
        section is the length of the 8-bit message content which
        follows immediately after the <LF> which terminates the
        initial response line. In this case, the text of the
        response is the decimal representation of the size of the
        message content to be transferred, in octets. The server

Weller-Fahy                  Experimental                       [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010

        MUST NOT include additional padding, leading zeroes, or
        other information is in this text. This is followed by
        exactly SIZE octets of 8-bit data representing the message
        content. The message content is followed by a K single-line
        response to indicate completion of the message content
        response.

   The server MUST NOT send any data to the client except in response
   to a command.

   With the exception of certain commands defined later, the client
   MUST NOT derive any information from the text portion of a A, E, K,
   U, or X single-line response, other than an optional informational
   message to display to the user.

3.2.3. Server Response Codes

   Response codes are a single character, followed immediately by zero
   or more response modifiers, followed by a single space and zero or
   more characters of additional information. The server MUST NOT send
   a space between the response code and response modifiers.

   The additional information is optional for some response codes
   (defined below). If the additional information is required
   (non-optional), it has a strict format defined by the command in
   question.

   When the additional information section is optional, it is free-form
   and continues until the end of the line.

   The server MUST send a space between the response code and the <LF>
   which terminates the response line if the additional information
   section is not supplied.

   * K

      + Successful completion of a command. The additional
        information section is optional and free-form, or required
        and strictly formatted, depending on the command.

   * X

      + Syntax error. The command was incorrect or not understood by
        the server. The additional information section is optional,
        free-form, and continues to the end of the line. Servers
        SHOULD use this to describe the error in more detail.

   * A

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


      + Temporary failure. The command was syntactically correct,
        but failed due to a transient error. The command might
        succeed if it is re-tried under similar conditions. This
        could be due to a server software error, administrative
        prohibition or policy. The additional information section is
        optional, free-form, and continues to the end of the line.
        Servers SHOULD use this to describe the failure reason in
        more detail.

   * E

      + Permanent failure. The command was syntactically correct,
        but failed permanently. The command will not succeed if it
        is re-tried under the same conditions. This could be due to
        a server software error, administrative prohibition or
        policy (i.e. read-only mail archive fails all PUT, SETFLAG,
        etc commands), etc. The additional information section is
        optional, free-form, and continues to the end of the line.
        Servers SHOULD use this to describe the failure reason in
        more detail.

   * U

      + Not supported. The command was recognized, but is not
        supported by the server for technical or policy reasons. The
        additional information section is optional, free-form, and
        continues to the end of the line. Servers MAY use this to
        describe the condition in more detail.

   * +

      + Successful completion of a command with a multiline
        response. The additional information section of each such
        response line is required, strictly formatted, and continues
        to the end of the line. The specific format depends on the
        command. Following the + response lines is one K line to
        indicate the completion of the multiline response.

3.2.4. Server Response Modifiers

   Server reponses MAY include a non-repeating sequence of one or more
   single-character response modifiers immediately following the
   response code (i.e. not preceded by a space).

   Servers MUST NOT send a response modifier which is not defined in
   this specification. Servers MUST NOT send the same response modifier
   more than once in a given response. Servers MAY send multiple
   response modifiers in any order. Clients MUST NOT expect response
   modifiers to be in any particular order.


Weller-Fahy                  Experimental                       [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


   The following response modifiers are defined.

   * C

       + The server is closing the connection after this response.
         The server will close the session immediately after sending
         the <LF> which terminates this response, exactly as if the
         client had sent a QUIT command. Servers MAY do this to
         manage load or for other reasons. Clients MUST NOT treat
         this as an error condition. If a client wishes to perform
         additional operations on this mail store after receiving a
         response including the C response modifier, they must
         establish a new connection, authorize with the AUTH command,
         and then proceed with their operation. Clients SHOULD NOT
         require user approval (i.e. clicking OK to a warning dialog)
         prior to doing this.

3.3. Mail Store Architecture

   Mail folders can only contain messages, not directories or other
   mail folders. The root of a BikINI mail store is a directory with
   the path '' (i.e. the empty path). Mail folders are identified by
   path relative to the root of the mail store (i.e. "directory/
   folder"). Clients MUST NOT include a trailing slash when identifying
   a mail folder to a server. Servers MUST NOT include a trailing slash
   on mail folder paths in the response to the LISTDIRS command. Note
   that the term folder is chosen to be neutral to storage formats, as
   servers are free to implement mail folders using any method they
   choose.

   Directories can only contain mail folders and other directories.
   Directories are identified by path relative to the root of the mail
   store (i.e. "directory" or "dir1/dir2"). Clients MUST NOT include a
   trailing slash when identifying a directory to a server. Servers
   MUST include a trailing slash on directory paths in the response to
   the LISTDIRS command to differentiate them from mail folders. The
   directory structure of a mail store MAY correspond to a filesystem
   structure on the server.

   BikINI directories look like filesystem directories to the client.
   Mail folders look like opaque objects which contain messages. The
   whole BikINI mail store maps cleanly to a filesystem tree, making
   obvious implementations easy.

   A mail store MAY contain directories, and it MUST contain at least
   one mail folder (the "inbox"). The "inbox" represents the default
   incoming mail directory of the user. Servers MAY logically map this
   to a mail folder physically outside of the rest of the mail store,
   such as the user's mail spool. The root of the mail store has the
   path '' (i.e., the empty path).

3.4. Message Attributes

   In the case of messages delivered via the MVMSG command only the
   Message Identifier MAY be changed, all other attributes MUST remain
   the same.

3.4.1. Message Identifier

   An arbitrary length token assigned to each message. Message
   identifiers MUST NOT contain any whitespace characters.

   Messages in BikINI are accessed strictly by means of their folder
   and identifier. This identifier is guaranteed not to refer to any
   other message in the mail folder.

   Unique identifiers persist as long as a given message resides in a
   particular folder (i.e. the server MAY change the message identifier
   if it is moved to another folder).

3.4.2. Flags Message Attribute

   A list of zero or more boolean variables assigned to a message.

   The following flags are defined.

   * D

      + Draft -- the client considers this message a draft.

   * F

      + Flagged -- user-defined meaning. Frequently used to mean
        "important".

   * N

      + New -- This message has not been retrieved (unless manually
        set by the client).

   * P

      + Passed -- The user has passed this message on to someone
        else (forwarded, bounced, etc).

   * R

      + Replied -- Client has sent a reply to this message.




Weller-Fahy                  Experimental                       [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


   * S

      + Seen -- This message has been read by the client.

   * T

      + Trashed -- The client has moved this message to the trash.

   The client may set or clear any flag.

   The GET command clears the N flag of the message in question as a
   side-effect.

   Multiple clients have to cooperate when accessing the same mail
   store; they have to agree on the meanings of some flags (like N, R,
   S, etc) for them to be useful. Clients SHOULD NOT set or clear flags
   in an arbitrary way; if a given client just arbitrarily clears the R
   flag on all messages, then that flag useless to other clients
   accessing the same mail store.

3.4.3. Internal Timestamp Message Attribute

   The internal timestamp of the message on the server. This is a date
   and time which reflects when the message was received by the BikINI
   server.

   If the message is received by the BikINI server, then it uses the
   timestamp the message was received as the internal timestamp.

   If the message is not received by the BikINI server (i.e. the
   message is delivered to the filesystem mailbox underlying the mail
   folder), then the BikINI server will base the internal timestamp on
   when the new message was detected and what type of mailbox underlies
   the mail folder (i.e. maildir, mbox, mix, etc.).

   The format used is similar to that of [RFC3339] without punctuation,
   "YYYYMMDDThhmmssTZD", with a timezone offset indicator of "Z" to
   indicate UTC (-0000).

   Examples:

    19970716T192030Z
    20030301T120000Z

   Servers MUST NOT use any other timezone offset when presenting the
   timestamp messages attribute to a client.

3.4.4. Message Size Attribute



Weller-Fahy                  Experimental                      [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


   The number of octets in the message (for GET, PUT, and LISTMSGS
   commands, or the number of octets in the message header for the
   GETHDR command), expressed as a positive nonzero decimal with no
   leading zeroes.

   If the sender (client or server) of a size attribute stores an [
   RFC2822] message using an end-of-line convention other than
   Unix-style <LF>-only, the sender MUST convert the message to <LF>
   -only before calculating the message's size.

3.4.5. Envelope Recipient Attribute

   The fully qualified address of the recipient of the message, at the
   time of delivery.

   If delivered via the PUT command, the envelope recipient is the
   address in the top-most "Delivered-To:" field of the message
   headers. If there is no "Delivered-To:" field, then the envelope
   recipient attribute will remain unset.

   If delivered directly to the underlying mailbox, the envelope
   recipient MUST be stored in the top-most "Delivered-To:" field of
   the message headers.

3.4.6. Envelope Sender Attribute

   The fully qualified address of the sender of the message, at the
   time of delivery.

   If delivered via the PUT command, the envelope recipient is the
   address in the "Return-Path:" trace field of the message headers. If
   there is no "Return-Path:" header, then the envelope recipient
   attribute may remain unset.

   If delivered directly to the underlying mailbox, the envelope sender
   MUST be stored in the "Return-Path:" trace field of the message
   headers.

3.5. Capability Tokens

   BikINI is designed to be an extensible protocol; clients should
   continue to work even if servers are upgraded to support new
   protocol features and vice versa. To accomplish this, clients need a
   way to determine what capabilities are supported by a given server.

   The CAPS command provides this information. The server's response is
   a multiline response, with one line per capability. The format of
   each line is a single capability token, optionally followed by
   additional information in a format specific to that token.


Weller-Fahy                  Experimental                      [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


   Servers MAY implement experimental or nonstandardized capabilities
   which are not listed in this specification using capability tokens
   beginning with "X-" (i.e. "X-FOO"). The BikINI protocol will never
   define a standard capability token beginning with "X-". I encourage
   client and server authors to register their "X-..." tokens with me
   to prevent collisions. Authors should implement experimental
   commands with the "X-" prefix and use the command name as the
   capability token representing the command. For example, an
   experimental glob search command might use the command X-GLOBSEARCH
   and be advertised with the capability token X-GLOBSEARCH.

   Servers MUST NOT send any capability tokens not defined in this
   specification with the exception of tokens beginning with "X-" as
   stated above. Clients MUST ignore tokens they do not understand.

   Currently defined tokens are:

   * STARTTLS

      + The server accepts STARTTLS as a signal to initiate a
        Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. This capability
        contains no additional information.
        See [TLS], [TLS-IMAP-POP3-ACAP], and [TLS-SMTP].

   * AUTH=PLAIN

      + The server accepts PLAIN as an AUTH method. This capability
        contains no additional information.
        See [AUTH-PLAIN].

   * AUTH=DIGEST-MD5

      + The server accepts DIGEST-MD5 as an AUTH method. This
        capability contains no additional information.
        See [AUTH-DIGEST-MD5].

   * AUTH=SCRAM-SHA1

      + The server accepts SCRAM-SHA1 as an AUTH method. This
        capability contains no additional information.
        See [AUTH-SCRAM-SHA1].

   * AUTH=GSSAPI

      + The server accepts GSSAPI as an AUTH method. This capability
        contains no additional information.
        See [AUTH-GSSAPI].

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


   * AUTH=KERBEROS_V5

      + The server accepts KERBEROS_V5 as an AUTH method. This
        capability contains no additional information.
        See [AUTH-KERBEROSV5].

   * AUTH=ANONYMOUS

      + The server accepts ANONYMOUS as an AUTH method. This
        capability's additional information is an optional list of
        mail folder paths available for anonymous reading separated
        by single spaces.
        See [AUTH-ANONYMOUS].

   * SEND

      + The server allows messages to be sent to recipients. This
        capability's additional information is an optional list of
        the protocols which could be used to SEND messages.

   * MESSAGE-SIZE

      + Servers MAY advertise their maximum incoming message size
        using this capability. This capability's additional
        information is the maximum allowed size of incoming messages
        (octets) in decimal format, without leading zeroes or other
        padding. A single "0" (zero) character means the server does
        not impose a static limit on message size. The absence of
        this capability in the resonse to the CAPS command does not
        necessarily mean the server imposes no limit on message
        size, but simply that any possible limit is not advertised.
        Clients MUST be prepared for a server to refuse the SEND
        command based on the message size in this case.

4. States and Flow

   A BikINI server is in one of five states.

   * Opening state
   * Index state
   * Message-Store state
   * Message-Retrieve state
   * Closed state

   All commands except CAPS are valid in only one state. It is a
   protocol error for the client to attempt a command while the
   connection is in an inappropriate state, and the server will respond
   with a syntax error response as described above.

4.1. Opening State

   This state is entered when the connection is established. The server
   does not issue a banner or any other greeting, but silently waits
   for the client to send the AUTH command to login.

   A failed AUTH command leaves the session in the opening state.
   Servers MAY limit the number of login attempts a client may attempt
   by dropping the connection after a number of unsuccessful AUTH`
   commands.

   A successful AUTH command puts the server into the index state.

   A successful STARTTLS command begins TLS negotiation and returns the
   the server to the opening state.

   A session timeout puts the server into the closed state.

   To close the session without logging in, the client MAY drop the
   connection without sending a command.

4.2. Index State

   This state is entered upon successful completion of the AUTH
   command. The client MUST issue the AUTH command before the server
   will grant access to the mail store.

   Preliminary success of the PUT command puts the server into the
   message-store state.

   Preliminary success of the GET or GETHDR command puts the server
   into the message-retrieve state.

   A QUIT command or session timeout puts the server into the closed
   state.

4.3. Message-Store State

   This state is entered upon preliminary success of the PUT command,
   indicated by a positive response by the server.

   Transfer of <content-size> octets of 8-bit data, the string
   "finished", and <LF> by the client, followed by a response from the
   server, puts the server into index state.

   A session timeout puts the server into the closed state.

4.4. Message-Retrieve State



Weller-Fahy                  Experimental                      [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


   This state is entered upon the preliminary success of the GET or
   GETHDR command, indicated by a "K <SP> <content-size> <LF>" response
   from the server.

   Transfer of <content-size> octets of 8-bit data followed by a
   positive response puts the server into the index state.

   A session timeout puts the server into the closed state.

4.5. Closed State

   This state is entered upon a QUIT command, a session timeout, or a
   server arbitrarily closing the connection. In this state, the server
   will close the socket without sending a warning.

5. Data Format and Line Endings

   Many legacy protocols such as [SMTP] use <CRLF> to end every line in
   the message transmission. However, most servers store messages
   natively using <LF>-only line endings. This means that messages must
   be encoded when transmitting a locally-stored message, and decoded
   when storing a received message.

   This leads to corruption of messages, or creation of messages which
   cannot be safely transmitted over such a protocol. If a protocol
   receiver converts incoming <CRLF> line endings to <LF>-only to store
   the messages, and then converts the <LF>-only lines back to <CRLF>
   line endings when transmitting the message, a message containing a
   bare <LF> character will be corrupted.

   The conversion is avoided by specifying that message content is sent
   as a length-prefixed 8-bit message. A message might not end with a
   newline. If a message is "lines of text", such as an [RFC2822]
   message, it is transmitted using <LF>-only line endings. If a BikINI
   protocol receiver wishes to store a message locally using <CRLF>
   line endings, it must perform the conversion after receiving the
   message, and must convert the message back to <LF>-only line endings
   before calculating the message's size and retransmitting the message
   over BikINI.

6. Commands

   Experimental commands must start with "X-". The Bikini protocol will
   never define a standard command starting with this prefix.

   Additional whitespace is included in examples when the example would
   otherwise be difficult to read. In cases where examples do not
   exactly match the formal syntax, follow the formal syntax.

6.1. Opening State

6.1.1. STARTTLS

   Function: Start Transport Layer Security (TLS).

   Syntax: STARTTLS

   Possible Responses:

   * Positive single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   * Negative single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   Notes:

   * Upon initial connection, a client MAY immediately send the
     STARTTLS command to secure further communication.

   * The positive single-line response will not be given until a TLS
     connection is successfully established.

   * The negative single-line response will be given in any case
     where the TLS connection cannot be successfully established.

   Examples:

   C:  STARTTLS
   C & S:  <negotiate a TLS session, and check result of negotiation>
   S:  K TLS connection established

   C:  STARTTLS
   S:  U STARTTLS not supported

   C:  STARTTLS
   S:  E STARTTLS not allowed from your address

   C:  STARTTLS
   S:  AC server busy, closing connection

6.1.2. AUTH

   Function: Log in.

   Syntax: AUTH auth-method [auth-token] [...]

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


   Possible Responses:

   * Positive single-line. The text portion of the response is
     required and contains a request for more data ("token?"), a
     server-supplied token, or confirmation the user has
     authenticated ("ok").

   * Negative single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   Notes:

   * The parameter auth-method is required. Other parameters vary
     depending on the method.

   * If a server does not support a particular auth-method for any
     reason, it MUST return an "unsupported" U response. This
     includes the case where an authentication method is implemented
     but forbidden by policy (such as not allowing insecure auth
     methods in an unencrypted session).

   * Upon initial connection, a client MAY immediately send the AUTH
     command using an auth-method of its choosing. Only if the server
     returns U does the client need to either try another well-known
     auth-method or retrieve the list of supported auth methods with
     the CAPS command. Clients MAY choose to remember what auth
     methods are supported by a particular host so as to avoid
     choosing an unsupported auth-method in their next session.

   * Servers MUST NOT close the session immediately after a
     successful response to the AUTH command. If the login would
     normally be successful but the server wishes to close the
     session, it must use the A response code.

   * The server cannot issue the C (connection close) response
     modifier with a successful response to this command. If the
     server wishes to close the connection and supply the C response
     modifier, it must use the temporary error A response.

   * The only positive responses used by the server are "K token?"
     (if further information is needed to finish authenticating the
     user), or "K ok" if the authentication was successful.

   Examples:

   C:  AUTH PLAIN dXNlckBob3N0LmRvbWFpbgBteSBwYXNzd29yZAA=
   S:  K ok

   C:  AUTH PLAIN dXNlckBob3N0LmRvbWFpbgBteSBwYXNzd29yZAA=
   S:  AC sorry, server too busy, closing connection

6.1.3. CAPS

   Function: List the capabilities of the server.

   Syntax: CAPS

   Possible Responses:

   * Positive multi-line. The text portion of the continuation lines
     is required and strictly formatted. The text portion of the
     final K-line is required and strictly formatted.

   * Negative single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   Notes:

   * The format of the text in each multi-line response line is "
     capability-token [ capability-info ... ]".

   * The format of the text in the final K-line is "server-type
     server-version".

   * A server with no additional capabilities MUST NOT send a
     negative response simply because it has no capabilities to list.
     It MUST respond with an empty capability list (i.e. a simple K
     success response).

   C:  CAPS
   S:  K Example 0.9.0

   C:  CAPS
   S:  EC service not available, closing connection

6.2 Index State

6.2.1. CAPS

   Function: List the capabilities of the server. See CAPS command in
   Opening State above.

6.2.2. QUIT

   Function: End session and close connection.

   Syntax: QUIT

   Possible Responses:

   * None. The server will close the connection immediately. The
     client SHOULD close the connection as soon as it has finished
     sending the QUIT command.

   Notes:

   * This command cannot fail. The server MUST close the connection
     when the QUIT command is received.

   * The QUIT command is only valid in the index state. If a client
     wishes to close a connection while in the opening state (i.e.
     before successfully logging in), it just closes the connection
     without sending a command.

   Examples:

   C:  QUIT
   [connection closes]

6.2.3. LISTDIRS

   Function: Retrieve list of directories and mail folders in mail
   store.

   Syntax: LISTDIRS

   Possible Responses:

   * Positive multi-line. The text portion of the intermediate lines
     of a positive multiline response is the path to a directory or
     mail folder relative to the mail store root. Directories end
     with a slash. Mail folders do not end with a slash.

   * Negative single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   Notes:

   * As every BikINI mail store (as presented to the client) must
     contain the "inbox" mail folder, a positive response to the
     LISTDIRS command will never have zero continuation + lines.
     Servers MUST include the "inbox" mail folder in LISTDIRS output.

   * The order of items in the listings is undefined. Servers MAY
     output the continuation + lines in any order they choose.
     Clients MUST be prepared for listings where a folder or
     directory is listed before the parent directory containing it.

   * The order of items in the listings is not guaranteed to be
     stable. Servers MAY change the order of items on each LISTDIRS
     command. Clients MUST NOT assume the order of listings will be
     the same between two LISTDIRS commands.

   * Servers MAY support multiple clients accessing the same mail
     store simultaneously. Folders and directories can therefore be
     created, deleted, moved, or renamed in situations other than in
     response to commands by the client. Clients MUST NOT assume that
     the directory and folder structure is stable. Clients MUST be
     prepared for a folder or directory to be renamed, moved, or
     deleted in between their last LISTDIRS command and a subsequent
     attempt to access that folder or directory.

   Examples:

   C:  LISTDIRS
   S:  + inbox
       + proj/
       + proj/a
       + proj/b

6.2.4. MKDIR

   Function: Create a new directory in the mail store.

   Syntax: MKDIR directory-path

   Possible Responses:

   * Positive single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   * Negative single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   Notes:

   * Clients MUST NOT attempt to create a directory in a parent
     directory that does not yet exist. To create a new hierachy, a
     client may have to issue a MKDIR command for a new directory,
     then another command to create a sub-directory within that
     directory.

   Examples:

   C:  MKDIR proj/a
   S:  K ok, directory created

   Notes:

   * Clients MUST NOT attempt to create a folder in a parent

   Function: Move an existing message from one mail folder to another.

   Syntax: MVMSG message-path folder-path

   Possible Responses:

   * Positive single-line. The text portion of the response is
     required and contains the message-identifier for the message's
     new location.

   * Negative single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   Notes:

   * The new message identifier is returned in the successful
     response.

   Examples:

   C:  MVMSG inbox/1045853047.5854.example.net proj/a
   S:  K 1045853047.5854.localhost

   Possible Responses:

   * Positive single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   * Negative single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   Notes:

   * If the client includes <folder-path>, then only the Trashed
     messages in <folder-path> are removed. If the client does not
     include <folder-path>, then all Trashed messages are removed.

   * If the client sends EXPUNGE when no Trashed messages exist, then
     the server MUST respond with the successful completion response
     code.

   Examples:

   C:  EXPUNGE inbox
   S:  K inbox expunged

   C:  EXPUNGE
   S:  K all trashed messages expunged

   C:  EXPUNGE proj/a
   S:  E proj/a does not exist

6.2.18. SEND

   Function: Ask the BikINI server to send an existing message to one
   or more recipients.

   Syntax: SEND message-path content-size

   Possible Responses:

   * Positive single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   * Negative single-line. The text portion of the response is
     optional, free form, and continues until the end of the line.

   Notes:

   * Once the server has responded to the SEND command with a
     positive response, the client sends exactly <content-size>
     octets of 8-bit envelope data to the server, followed by
     "finished", followed by <LF>. The format of the envelope is an

     envelope sender address, followed by an ASCII NUL, followed by
     an envelope recipient address, followed by an ASCII NUL,
     optionally followed by additional envelope recipient addresses,
     each followed by an ASCII NUL.

   * All addresses in the envelope data MUST be in fully-qualified
     form.

   * The server MAY use any method it chooses to deliver the message
     to the recipients. This may be by handing the message to the
     local Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) for delivery via [SMTP] or
     another protocol, by delivering directly into another BikINI
     mail store on the server, other methods, or a combination of
     these methods.

   * Some delivery methods may impose stricter requirements on the
     format of a message than BikINI does. For example, messages with
     partial final lines (no trailing <LF>) cannot be transmitted
     as-is over [SMTP]. The server MAY choose to modify the message
     to enable it to be delivered (i.e. add a trailing newline to the
     message when it is delivered via [SMTP]), or it MAY choose to
     refuse to deliver the message. Should the server modify the
     message to enable it to be delivered, then the server MUST
     notify the client of the modification.

   * When delivering a message via [SMTP], a BikINI server MUST
     ensure that the message to be delivered meets at least the basic
     requirements of messages according to [RFC2822]. In particular,
     the server MUST ensure that the message header contains all
     required fields, and that all fields are syntactically correct.
     The server MAY choose to enforce stricter requirements (such as
     ensuring that the envelope sender or "From:" header addresses
     belong to the user).

   Examples:

   C:  SEND proj/a/1046273407.M181707P22689Q2.localhost 65
   S:  K ok, send envelope of 65 octets
   C:  sender@host.domain\0recip1@example.org\0recip2@example.net\0

   S:  K ok, message sent to 2 recipient(s)

   S:  E SEND not permitted

7. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234] including the core
   rules in Appendix B.1, [RFC3339] section 5.6, and [RFC3696].

   Except as noted otherwise, all ABNF literal text strings are
   case-sensitive. Implementations MUST accept these strings in a
   case-sensitive fashion.

   send-command        = SEND SP message-path SP content-size LF

   send-envelope       = 2*( envelope-spec NUL ) FIN LF

8. Examples

   Here are examples of various BikINI commands and responses.

8.1. Log in and retrieve new messages from default incoming mail

   Note that the message's N (new) flag is cleared by the successful
   GET operation.

8.2. Log in, retrieve the mail store structure, and store a message

   C:  AUTH PLAIN dXNlckBob3N0LmRvbWFpbgBteSBwYXNzd29yZAA=
   S:  K ok
   C:  LISTDIRS

       K ok
   C:  QUIT
   S:  K goodbye

   The client retrieves the directory structure, lists the contents of
   mail folder "foobar/pymsgauth" (which is empty), stores a message
   (and is given the message identifier for the stored message by the
   server), lists the contents of the mail folder again (showing the
   message), sets the F flag on the message, lists the contents of the
   mail folder again (showing the flag is now set), and quits.

   Note that the message's N (new) flag is initially clear when stored
   with the PUT command.

8.3. Log in procedure, including a failed login due to unsupported
   method

   C:  AUTH PLAIN dXNlckBob3N0LmRvbWFpbgBteSBwYXNzd29yZAA=
   S:  U AUTH PLAIN unsupported
   C:  CAPS
   S:  + STARTTLS
       + AUTH=GSSAPI
       + AUTH=KERBEROS_V5
       + MESSAGE-SIZE 2000000
       K Example 0.9.0
   C:  STARTTLS
   C & S:  <negotiate a TLS session, and check result of negotiation>
   S:  K TLS connection established
   C:  CAPS
   S:  + AUTH=PLAIN
       + AUTH=GSSAPI
       + AUTH=KERBEROS_V5
       + MESSAGE-SIZE 2000000
       K Example 0.9.0
   C:  AUTH PLAIN dXNlckBob3N0LmRvbWFpbgBteSBwYXNzd29yZAA=
   [...]

   The client connects and tries to log in using "AUTH PLAIN". The
   server forbids this in unencrypted sessions (no STARTTLS), so it
   replies with U "unsupported". The client issues the STARTTLS command
   to encrypt this session, then issues the CAPS command to retrieve a
   list of supported AUTH methods and logs in using one of them.

   Note that the server's CAPS response might be different after the
   STARTTLS command, as it might then include options such as "AUTH=
   PLAIN", and will not include STARTTLS.

9. Security Considerations

   Security considerations about the email system and messages are
   covered in [RFC5322] and [SMTP], and will not be covered here.

9.1. Authentication

   Authentication of the user is accomplished using a variety of AUTH
   methods including PLAIN. Implementations of this protocol SHOULD NOT
   allow PLAIN authentication unless the connection has been secured
   via a successfull STARTTLS command.

Internet-Draft        BikINI (BikINI Is Not IMAP)          February 2010


9.2. STARTTLS

   Implementors MUST implement the TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
   CipherSuite, and SHOULD implement the
   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA CipherSuite. This will ensure all
   compliant clients and servers can interoperate.

9.3. Announcements

   While some small amount of security may be gained through hiding the
   server type and version, use of that data when debugging problems is
   beyond dispute. BikINI servers MUST make their type and version
   information available in the final K-line of the CAPS command
   response.

10. IANA Considerations

   As a port will be used to access any servers using this protocol,
   the author requests assignment of TCP port 40 to BikINI.

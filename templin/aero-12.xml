      <t>Nodes attached to common multi-access link types (e.g.,
      multicast-capable, shared media, non-broadcast multiple access (NBMA),
      etc.) can exchange packets as neighbors on the link, but may not always

      selection. Such nodes should therefore be able to discover a trusted

      to reach off-link destinations and redirection services to inform the
      node of an on-link neighbor that is closer to the final destination.
      This redirection can provide a useful route optimization, since the
      triangular path from the ingress link neighbor, to the intermediate
      router, and finally to the egress link neighbor may be considerably
      longer than the direct path from ingress to egress. However, ordinary
      redirection may lead to operational issues on certain link types and/or

        </figure>This classical redirection can provide a useful route
      optimization, since the triangular path from the ingress link neighbor,
      to the intermediate router, and finally to the egress link neighbor may
      be considerably longer than the direct path from ingress to egress.
      However, ordinary redirection may lead to operational issues on certain
      link types and/or in certain deployment scenarios.</t>

      <t>For example, when an ingress link neighbor accepts an ordinary
      redirection message, it has no way of knowing whether the egress link
      neighbor is ready and willing to accept packets directly without
      forwarding through an intermediate router. Likewise, the egress has no
      way of knowing that the ingress is authorized to forward packets from
      the claimed network-layer source address. (This is especially important
      for very large links, since any node on the link can spoof the
      network-layer source address with low probability of detection even if
      the link-layer source address cannot be spoofed.) Additionally, the
      ingress would have no way of knowing whether the direct path to the
      egress has failed, nor whether the final destination has moved away from
      the egress to some other network attachment point.</t>

      <t>Therefore, a new approach is required that can enable redirection
      signaling from the egress to the ingress link node under the mediation
      of a trusted intermediate router. The mechanism is asymmetric (since
      only the forward direction from the ingress to the egress is optimized)
      and extended (since the redirection extends forward to the egress before
      reaching back to the ingress). This document therefore introduces an
      Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) capability that addresses
      the issues.</t>

      <t>While the AERO mechanisms were initially designed for the specific
      purpose of NBMA tunnel virtual interfaces (e.g., see: <xref
      target="RFC2529"></xref><xref target="RFC5214"></xref><xref
      target="RFC5569"></xref><xref target="I-D.templin-intarea-vet"></xref>)
      they can also be applied to any multiple access link types that support
      redirection. The AERO techniques are discussed herein with reference to
      IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"></xref><xref target="RFC4861"></xref><xref
      target="RFC4862"></xref><xref target="RFC3315"></xref>, however they can
      also be applied to any other network layer protocol (e.g., IPv4 <xref
      target="RFC0791"></xref><xref target="RFC0792"></xref><xref
      target="RFC2131"></xref>, etc.) that provides a redirection service
      (details of operation for other network layer protocols are out of
      scope.)</t>

      <t>This document is intended for publication on the experimental track,
      and therefore does not seek to define a new standard for the Internet.
      Experimental instead of standards-track is requested since the document
      proposes a new and different dynamic routing mechanism. Experimentation
      will focus on candidate multiaccess link types that can connect large
      numbers of neighboring nodes where the use of existing dynamic routing
      protocols may be impractical. Examples include NBMA tunnel virtual
      links, large bridged campus LANs, etc.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Motivation">
      <t>AERO was designed to operate as an on-demand route optimization
      function for nodes attached to a single multi-access link, i.e., similar
      to the standard ICMPv6 redirect mechanism. However, AERO differs in that
      the target of the redirection first receives a pre-authorization
      notification, after which it returns route optimization information to
      the source of the original packet. This scenario calls into question
      whether a standard dynamic routing protocol could be used instead of
      AERO, but a number of considerations indicate that standard routing
      protocols may be poorly suited for the use cases AERO was designed to
      address.</t>

      <t>First, AERO is designed to work on very large multiple access links
      that may connect a mix of many thousands of routers and hosts. Classical
      proactive dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF, IS-IS, RIP, OLSR and
      TBRPF may be inefficient in such environments due to the control message
      overhead scaling when large numbers of routers are present and/or when
      link capacity is low.</t>

      <t>Secondly, AERO is designed to work on-demand of data packet arrival,
      but only seeks to discover neighbors on the same link and not distant
      nodes that may be located many link hops away. Reactive dynamic routing
      protocols such as AODV and DSR also operate on-demand, however they
      flood specialized route discovery messages that reach all nodes on the
      link and may further traverse multiple link hops before a route reply is
      received. This requires a multicast-capable network and does not ensure
      delivery of the original data packet which may be dropped or delayed
      during route discovery.</t>

      <t>Additionally, AERO is designed to override an existing route to a
      destination if the existing route directs traffic along a sub-optimal
      path via an extraneous router on the shared link. AERO nodes send data
      packets over a pre-existing working route, and may subsequently receive
      notification of a better route based on route optimization feedback from
      a trusted on-link neighbor. This stands in contrast to on-demand routing
      protocols that were designed to operate when no pre-existing working
      routes are present and that multicast explicit route request messages to
      receive a route reply rather than simply unicast forwarding the data
      packet via a pre-existing route.</t>

      <t>Finally, AERO requires less control message and/or processing
      overhead than standard dynamic routing protocols on links for which the
      number of routes that must be maintained by each router is far smaller
      than the total number of routers on the link, and the routes maintained
      by each router may be changing over time. For example, on a link that
      connects N nodes it will often be the case that each node will only
      communicate with a small number link neighbors, and the set of neighbors
      may change dynamically over time. Therefore, the number of active
      neighbor pairs on the link is V*N (where V is a small variable number)
      instead of N**2. This is especially important on very large links, e.g.,
      for values of N such as 1,000 or more.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Example Use Cases">
      <t>AERO was designed to satisfy numerous operational use cases. As a
      first example, a hypothetical major airline has deployed an overlay
      network on top of the global Internet to track the aircraft in its
      fleet. The global Internet therefore acts as the "link" over which the
      overlay network is configured. Each aircraft acts as a mobile router
      that fronts for an internal network that includes various devices
      controlled and monitored by the airline. However, it would be
      impractical for each aircraft to track the changing locations of all
      other aircraft in the fleet due to control message overhead on limited
      capacity communication links.</t>

      <t>In this example, an aircraft 'A' en route to its destination needs to
      report its ETA and communicate passenger itineraries to other en route
      aircraft that will be servicing passenger connections. 'A' knows the
      overlay network addresses of the other aircraft, but does not know the
      current underlay address mappings. 'A' sends its initial messages
      targeted to the other aircraft via an airline central dispatch router
      'D', which may be located in a far away location. 'D' forwards the
      messages, but also initiates the AERO redirection procedure to step out
      of the triangular path and allow direct aircraft-to-aircraft
      communications.</t>

      <t>In a second example, Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are often
      deployed in environments with a high degree of mobility, attrition, and
      very limited wireless communications link bandwidth. Such environments
      typically also require the use of network layer security mechanisms that
      view the MANET as a "link" over which encrypted messages are forwarded
      in an overlay network. In such environments, a dynamic routing protocol
      running in the overlay network may serve to add unacceptable additional
      congestion to the already overtaxed wireless links. In that case, the
      AERO route optimization mechanism can eliminate costly extraneous
      routing hops without imparting additional control message overhead.</t>

      <t>In a further example, a large campus LAN that is joined by L2 bridges
      may connect many thousands of routers and hosts that appear to share a
      single common multi-access link. In that case, the AERO mechanisms can
      be applied to satisfy the necessary intra-link route optimization
      functions without employing an adjunct dynamic routing protocol that may
      be inefficient for reasons mentioned above.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>The route optimization mechanism must satisfy the following

    <section title="Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO)">
      <t>The following sections specify an Asymmetric Extended Route
      Optimization (AERO) capability that fulfills the requirements specified
      in Section 5.</t>

      <section anchor="routing-proto" title="AERO Link Dynamic Routing">
        <t>In many AERO link use case scenarios (e.g., small enterprise
        networks, small and stable MANETs, etc.), routers can engage in a
        classical dynamic routing protocol so that routing/forwarding tables
        can be populated and standard forwarding between routers can be used.
        In other scenarios (e.g., large enterprise/ISP networks, cellular
        service provider networks, dynamic MANETs, etc.), this might be
        impractical due to routing protocol control message scaling
        issues.</t>

        <t>When a classical dynamic routing protocol cannot be used, the
        mechanisms specified in this section can provide a useful on-demand
        route discovery capability. When both classical dynamic routing
        protocols and the AERO mechanism are active on the same link, routes
        discovered by the dynamic routing protocol should take precedence over
        those discovered by AERO.</t>

          network-layer addresses and prefixes.</t>

          <t>When the intermediate router completes a stateful network-layer
          address or prefix delegation transaction (e.g., as a DHCPv6
          relay/server, etc.), it establishes forwarding table entries that
          list the link-layer address of the client AERO node as the
          link-layer address of the next hop toward the delegated
          network-layer addresses/prefixes.</t>

          <t>When the intermediate router forwards a packet out the same AERO
          interface it arrived on, it initiates an AERO route optimization

        <t>In <xref target="no-onlink-prefix-fig"></xref>, intermediate AERO
        router ('A') connects to the AERO link and also connects to the IPv6
        Internet, either directly or via other IPv6 routers (not shown).
        Intermediate router ('A') configures an AERO link interface with a
        link-local network-layer address L3(A) and with link-layer address
        L2(A). The intermediate router next arranges to add L2(A) to a
        published list of valid intermediate routers for the link.</t>

        <t>AERO node ('B') is an AERO edge router that connects to the AERO
        link via an interface with link-local network-layer address L3(B) and
        with link-layer address L2(B). Node ('B') configures a default route
        with next-hop network-layer address L3(A) via the AERO interface, and
        also assigns the network-layer prefix 2001:db8:0::/48 to its attached
        EUN link. IPv6 host ('C') attaches to the EUN, and configures the
        network-layer address 2001:db8:0::1.</t>

        <t>AERO node ('D') is an AERO edge router that connects to the AERO
        link via an interface with link-local network-layer address L3(D) and
        with link-layer address L2(D). Node ('D') configures a default route
        with next-hop network-layer address L3(A) via the AERO interface, and
        also assigns the network-layer prefix 2001:db8:1::/48 to its attached
        EUN link. IPv6 host ('E') attaches to the EUN, and configures the
        network-layer address 2001:db8:1::1.</t>

        <t>AERO host ('F') connects to the AERO link via an interface with
        link-local network-layer address L3(F) and with link-layer address
        L2(F). Host ('F') configures a default route with next-hop
        network-layer address L3(A) via the AERO interface, and also assigns
        the network-layer address 2001:db8:2::1 to the AERO interface.</t>

        <t>Finally, IPv6 host ('G') connects to an IPv6 network outside of the
        AERO link domain. Host ('G') configures its IPv6 interface in a manner
        specific to its attached IPv6 link, and assigns the network-layer
        address 2001:db8:3::1 to its IPv6 link interface.</t>

        <t>In these arrangements, intermediate router ('A') must maintain
        state that associates the delegated network-layer addresses/prefixes
        with the link-local network-layer addresses of the correct edge
        routers and/or hosts on the AERO link. The nodes must in turn maintain
        at least a default route that points to intermediate router ('A'), and
        can discover more-specific routes either via a proactive dynamic
        routing protocol or via the AERO mechanisms specified in <xref
        target="predirect"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="predirect" title="AERO Specification">
        <t><xref target="avoidance-fig"></xref> describes the AERO reference
        operational scenario. We now discuss the operation and protocol
        details of AERO with respect to this reference scenario.</t>

        <section title="Classical Redirection Approaches">
          <t>With reference to <xref target="no-onlink-prefix-fig"></xref>,
          when IPv6 source host ('C') sends a packet to an IPv6 destination
          host ('E'), the packet is first forwarded via the EUN to ingress
          AERO node ('B'). The ingress node ('B') then forwards the packet
          over its AERO interface to intermediate router ('A'), which then
          forwards the packet to egress AERO node ('D'), where the packet is
          finally forwarded to the IPv6 destination host ('E'). When
          intermediate router ('A') forwards the packet back out on its
          advertising AERO interface, it must arrange to redirect ingress node
          ('B') toward egress node ('D') as a better next hop node on the AERO
          link that is closer to the final destination. However, this
          redirection process should only occur if there is assurance that
          both the ingress and egress nodes are willing participants.</t>

          <t>Consider a first alternative in which intermediate router ('A')
          informs ingress node ('B') only and does not inform egress node
          ('D') (i.e., "classic redirection"). In that case, the egress node
          has no way of knowing that the ingress is authorized to forward
          packets from their claimed source network-layer addresses, and may
          simply elect to drop the packets. Also, the ingress node has no way
          of knowing whether the egress is performing some form of source
          address filtering that would reject packets arriving from a node
          other than a trusted default router, nor whether the egress is even
          reachable via a direct path that does not involve the intermediate
          router. Finally, the ingress node has no way of knowing whether the
          final destination has moved away from egress node.</t>

          <t>Consider also a second alternative in which intermediate router
          ('A') informs both ingress node ('B') and egress node ('D')
          separately via independent redirection messages (i.e., "augmented
          redirection"). In that case, several conditions can occur that could
          result in communication failures. First, if the ingress receives the
          redirection message but the egress does not, subsequent packets sent
          by the ingress could be dropped due to filtering since the egress
          would not have neighbor state to verify their source network-layer
          addresses. Second, if the egress receives the redirection message
          but the ingress does not, subsequent packets sent in the reverse
          direction by the egress would be lost. Finally, timing issues
          surrounding the establishment and garbage collection of neighbor
          state at the ingress and egress nodes could yield unpredictable
          behavior. For example, unless the timing were carefully coordinated
          through some form of synchronization loop, there would invariably be
          instances in which one node has the correct neighbor state and the
          other node does not resulting in non-deterministic packet loss.</t>

          <t>Since neither of these alternatives can satisfy the requirements
          listed in Section 5, a new redirection technique (i.e., "AERO
          redirection") is needed.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="AERO Concept of Operations">
          <t>AERO redirection is used on links for which the classical
          redirection approaches described in Section 6.4.1 are insufficient
          to satisfy all requirements. We now discuss the concept of
          operations for this new approach.</t>

          <t>Again with reference to <xref
          target="no-onlink-prefix-fig"></xref>, when source host ('C') sends
          a packet to destination host ('E'), the packet is first forwarded
          over the source host's attached EUN to ingress node ('B'), which
          then forwards the packet via its AERO interface to intermediate
          router ('A').</t>

          <t>Using AERO redirection, intermediate router ('A') then forwards
          the packet out the same AERO interface toward egress node ('D') and
          also sends a "Predirect" message forward to the egress node as
          specified in Section 6.4.6. The Predirect message includes the
          identity of ingress node ('B') as well as information that egress
          node ('D') can use to determine the longest-match prefixes that
          cover the source and destination network-layer addresses of the
          packet that triggered the Predirect. After egress node ('D')
          receives the Predirect, it process the message and returns a
          Redirect message to the intermediate router ('A') as specified in
          Section 6.4.7. (During the process, it also creates or updates
          neighbor state for ingress node ('B'), and retains this (src, dst)
          "prefix pair" as ingress filtering information to accept future
          packets using addresses matched by the prefixes from ingress node
          ('B').)</t>

          <t>When the intermediate router ('A') receives the Redirect message,
          it processes the message and forwards it on to ingress node ('B') as
          specified in Section 6.4.8. The Redirect message includes the
          identity of egress node ('D') as well as information that ingress
          node ('B') can use to determine the longest-match prefixes that
          cover the source and destination network-layer addresses of the
          packet that triggered the Redirect. After ingress node ('B')
          receives the Redirect, it processes the message as specified in
          Section 6.4.9. (During the process, it also creates or updates
          neighbor state for egress node ('D'), and retains this prefix pair
          as forwarding information to forward future packets using addresses
          matched by the prefixes to the egress node ('D').)</t>

          <t>Following the above Predirect/Redirect message exchange,
          forwarding of packets with source and destination network-layer
          addresses covered by the longest-match prefix pair is enabled in the
          forward direction from ingress node ('B') to egress node ('D'). The
          mechanisms that enable this exchange are specified in the following
          sections.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Conceptual Data Structures and Protocol Constants">
          <t>Each AERO node maintains a per AERO interface conceptual neighbor
          cache that includes an entry for each neighbor it communicates with
          on the AERO link the same as for any IPv6 interface (see: <xref
          target="RFC4861"></xref>).</t>

          <t>Each AERO interface neighbor cache entry further maintains two
          lists of (src, dst) prefix pairs. The AERO node adds a prefix pair
          to the ACCEPT list if it has been informed by a trusted intermediate
          router that it is safe to accept packets from the neighbor using
          network-layer source and destination addresses covered by the prefix
          pair. The AERO node adds a prefix pair to the FORWARD list if it has
          been informed by a trusted intermediate router that it is permitted
          to forward packets to the neighbor using network-layer addresses
          covered by the prefix pair.</t>

          <t>When the node adds a prefix pair to a neighbor cache entry ACCEPT
          list, it also sets an expiration timer for the prefix pair to
          ACCEPT_TIME seconds. When the node adds a prefix pair to a neighbor
          cache entry FORWARD list, it also sets an expiration timer for the
          prefix pair to FORWARD_TIME seconds. The node further maintains a
          keepalive interval KEEPALIVE_TIME used to limit the number of
          keepalive control messages. Finally, the node maintains a constant
          value MAX_RETRY to limit the number of keepalives sent when a
          neighbor has gone unreachable.</t>

          <t>It is RECOMMENDED that FORWARD_TIME be set to the default
          constant value 30 seconds to match the default REACHABLE_TIME value
          specified for IPv6 neighbor discovery <xref
          target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

          <t>It is RECOMMENDED that ACCEPT_TIME be set to the default constant
          value 40 seconds to allow a 10 second window so that the AERO
          redirection procedure can converge before the ACCEPT_TIME timer
          decrements below FORWARD_TIME.</t>

          <t>It is RECOMMENDED that KEEPALIVE_TIME be set to the default
          constant value 5 seconds to providing timely reachability
          verification without causing excessive control message overhead.</t>

          <t>It is RECOMMENDED that MAX_RETRY be set to 3 the same as
          described for IPv6 neighbor discovery address resolution in Section
          7.3.3 of <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Different values for FORWARD_TIME, ACCEPT_TIME, KEEPALIVE_TIME
          and MAX_RETRY MAY be administratively set if necessary to better
          match the AERO link's performance characteristics; however, if
          different values are chosen all nodes on the link MUST consistently
          configure the same values. ACCEPT_TIME SHOULD further be set to a
          value that is sufficiently longer than FORWARD time to allow the
          AERO redirection procedure to converge.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="verify" title="Data Origin Authentication">
          <t>AERO nodes MUST employ a data origin authentication check for the
          packets they receive on an AERO interface. In particular, the node
          considers the network-layer source address correct for the
          link-layer source address if at least one of the following is
          true:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>the network-layer source address is an on-link address that
              embeds the link-layer source address, or</t>

              <t>the network-layer source address is explicitly linked to the
              link-layer source address through per-neighbor state, or</t>

              <t>the link-layer source address is the address of a trusted
              intermediate AERO router.</t>
            </list>When the AERO node receives a packet on an AERO interface,
          it processed the packet further if it satisfies one of these data
          origin authentication conditions; otherwise it drops the packet.</t>

          <t>Note that on links in which link-layer address spoofing is
          possible, AERO nodes may require additional securing mechanisms. To
          address this, future work will define a strong data origin
          authentication scheme such as the use of digital signatures.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="rmsg" title="AERO Redirection Message Format">
          <t>AERO redirection messages use the same format as for ICMPv6
          Redirect messages depicted in Section 4.5 of <xref

          <t>The AERO redirection message sender sets the 'Type' field to 0
          (since this is not an actual ICMPv6 message), and also sets the
          'Checksum' field to 0 (since the UDP checksum will provide
          protection for the entire packet). The sender further sets the 'P'

          <t>The AERO redirection message sender sets the UDP destination port
          number to 'AERO_PORT" and sets the UDP source port number to a
          (pseudo-)random value. The sender next sets the UDP length field to
          the length of the UDP message, then calculates the checksum across
          the message and writes the value into the UDP checksum field. Next,
          the sender sets the IP TTL/Hop-limit field to a small integer value
          chosen to provide a quick exit from any temporal routing loops. It
          is RECOMMENDED that the sender set IP TTL/Hop-limit to the value 8

        <section title="Forwarding Redirects">
          <t>When the intermediate router ('A') receives an AERO Redirect
          message, it accepts the message only if it satisfies the data origin
          authentication requirements specified in Section 6.4.4. Next, the
          intermediate router ('A') validates the message the same as
          described in Section 6.4.7. Following validation, the intermediate
          router ('A') processes the Redirect, and then forwards a
          corresponding Redirect on to the ingress node ('B') as follows.</t>

          <t>In the reference operational scenario, the intermediate router
          ('A') receives the AERO Redirect message from the egress node ('D')
          and prepares to forward a corresponding Redirect message to the
          ingress node ('B'). The intermediate router ('A') then verifies that
          the RIO encodes a network-layer address/prefix that the egress node
          ('D') is authorized to use, and discards the message if verification
          fails. Otherwise, the intermediate router ('A') changes the
          link-layer source address of the message to 'L2(A)', changes the
          network-layer source address of the message to the link-local
          network-layer address 'L3(A)', and changes the link-layer
          destination address to 'L2(B)' . The intermediate router ('A')
          finally decrements the IP TTL/Hop-limit and forwards the message to
          the ingress node ('B').</t>

        <section title="Processing Redirects">
          <t>When the ingress node ('B') receives an AERO Redirect message
          (i.e., one with P=0), it accepts the message only if it satisfies

          6.4.4. Next, the ingress node ('B') validates the message the same
          as described in Section 6.4.6. Following validation, the ingress
          node ('B') then processes the message as follows.</t>

          <t>In the reference operational scenario, when the ingress node
          ('B') receives the AERO Redirect message it either creates or
          updates a neighbor cache entry that stores the Target address of the
          message (i.e., the link-local network-layer address of the egress
          node 'L3(D)'). The ingress node ('B') then records the (src, dst)
          prefix pair associated with the triggering packet in the neighbor
          cache entry FORWARD list, i.e., it records its prefix that matches
          the redirected packet's network-layer source address and the prefix
          listed in the RIO as the prefix pair. The ingress node ('B') then
          sets/resets an expiration timer for the prefix pair to FORWARD_TIME
          seconds. If the timer later expires, the ingress node ('B') deletes
          the entry.</t>

          <t>Now, the ingress node ('B') has a neighbor cache FORWARD list
          entry for the prefix pair, and the egress node ('D') has a neighbor
          cache ACCEPT list entry for the prefix pair. Therefore, the ingress
          node ('B') may forward ordinary network-layer data packets with
          network-layer source and destination addresses that match the prefix
          pair directly to the egress node ('D') without forwarding through
          the intermediate router ('A'). Note that the ingress node must have
          a way of informing the network layer of a route that associates the
          destination prefix with this neighbor cache entry. The manner of
          establishing such a route (and deleting it when it is no longer
          necessary) is left to the implementation.</t>

          <t>To enable packet forwarding in the reverse direction, a separate
          AERO redirection operation is required which is the mirror-image of
          the forward operation described above but the link segments
          traversed in the forward and reverse directions may be different,
          i.e., the operations are asymmetric.</t>

        <section title="Sending Periodic Predirect Keepalives">
          <t>In order to prevent prefix pairs from expiring while data packets
          are actively flowing, the ingress node ('B') can send AERO Predirect
          keepalive messages directly to the egress node ('D') to solicit AERO
          Redirect messages. The node should send a keepalive message only
          when a data packet covered by the prefix pair has been sent
          recently, and should wait for at least KEEPALIVE_TIME seconds before
          sending each successive keepalive message in order to limit control
          message overhead.</t>

                 title="Neighbor Reachability Considerations">
          <t>When the ingress node ('B') receives an AERO Redirect message
          informing it of a direct path to a new egress node ('D'), there is a
          question in point as to whether the new egress node ('D') can be
          reached directly without forwarding through an intermediate router
          ('A'). On some AERO links, it may be reasonable for the ingress node
          ('B') to (optimistically) assume that reachability is transitive,
          and to immediately begin forwarding data packets to the egress node
          ('D') without testing reachability.</t>

          <t>On AERO links in which an optimistic assumption of transitive
          reachability may be unreasonable, however, the ingress node ('B')
          can defer the redirection until it tests the direct path to the
          egress node ('D'), e.g., by sending an IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation to
          elicit an IPv6 Neighbor Advertisement response. If the ingress node
          ('B') is unable to elicit a response after MAX_RETRY attempts, it
          should consider the direct path to the egress node ('D') as
          unusable.</t>

          <t>In either case, the ingress node ('B') can process any link
          errors corresponding to the data packets sent directly to the egress
          node ('D') as a hint that the direct path has either failed or has
          become intermittent. Conversely, the ingress node ('B') can further
          process any Redirect messages received as evidence of neighbor
          reachability.</t>

          configure both a non-advertising router interface on a provider AERO
          link and advertising router interfaces on its connected EUN links.
          When an EUN node ('E') in one of the egress node's connected EUNs
          moves to a different network point of attachment, however, it can
          release its network-layer address/prefix delegations that were

          EUN node ('E') via a trusted intermediate router and may
          subsequently receive new AERO Redirect messages to discover that the
          EUN node ('E' ) is now associated with a new AERO edge router.</t>

          <t>Note that any packets forwarded by the egress node ('D') via a
          departed forwarding table entry may be lost if the (mobile) EUN node
          ('E') moves off-link with respect to its previous EUN point of
          attachment. This should not be a problem for large links (e.g.,
          large cellular network deployments, large ISP networks, etc.) in
          which all/most mobility events are intra-link.</t>

        <section title="Link-Layer Address Change Considerations">
          <t>When an ingress node needs to change its link-layer address, it
          deletes each FORWARD list entry that was established under the old
          link layer address, changes the link layer address, then allows
          packets to again flow through an intermediate router. Any egress
          node that receives the packets will also receive new Predirect
          messages from the intermediate router. The egress node then deletes
          the ACCEPT entry that included the ingress node&rsquo;s old
          link-layer address and installs a new ACCEPT entry that includes the
          ingress node&rsquo;s new link-layer address. The egress then returns
          a new Redirect message to the ingress node via the intermediate
          router, which the ingress node uses to establish a new FORWARD list
          entry.</t>

          <t>When an egress node needs to change its link-layer address, it
          deletes each entry in the ACCEPT list and SHOULD also send NULL AERO
          Redirect messages to the corresponding ingress node (i.e., the same
          as described for mobility operations in Section 6.4.12) before
          changing the link-layer address. Any ingress node that receives the
          NULL Redirect messages will delete any corresponding FORWARD list
          entries and again allow packets to flow through an intermediate
          router. The egress then changes the link-layer address, and sends
          new Redirect messages in response to any Predirect messages it
          receives from the intermediate router while using the new link-layer
          address.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Prefix Re-Provisioning Considerations">
          <t>When an AERO node configures one or more FORWARD/ACCEPT list
          prefix pair entries, and the prefixes associated with the pair are
          somehow re-configured or renumbered, the stale FORWARD/ACCEPT list
          information must be deleted.</t>

          <t>When an ingress node ('B') re-configures it's network-layer
          source prefix in such a way that the ACCEPT list entry in the egress
          node ('D') would no longer be valid (e.g., the prefix length of the
          source prefix changes), the ingress node ('B') simply deletes the
          prefix pair form its FORWARD list and allows subsequent packets to
          again flow through an intermediate router ('A').</t>

          <t>When the egress node ('D') re-configures it's network-layer
          destination prefix in such a way that the FORWARD list entry in the
          ingress node ('B') would no longer be valid, the egress node ('D')
          sends a NULL AERO Redirect message to the ingress node ('B') the
          same as described for mobility and link-layer address change
          considerations when it receives either an AERO Predirect message or
          a data packet (subject to rate limiting) from the ingress node ('B')
          .</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="backward" title="Backward Compatibility">
          <t>There are no backward compatibility considerations since AERO
          redirection messages use a new UDP port number that distinguishes
          them from other kinds of control messages. Therefore, legacy nodes
          will simply discard ant AERO redirection messages they may
          accidentally receive.</t>

          <t>Note however that AERO redirection requires that all three of the
          ingress, intermediate router and egress participate in the protocol.
          Additionally, the intermediate router SHOULD disable ordinary ICMPv6
          Redirects when AERO redirection is enabled.</t>

    <section anchor="secure" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>AERO link security considerations are the same as for standard IPv6
      Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"></xref> except that AERO
      improves on some aspects. In particular, AERO is dependent on a trust
      basis between AERO edge nodes and intermediate routers, where the edge
      nodes must only engage in the AERO mechanism when it is facilitated by a
      trusted intermediate router.</t>

      <t>AERO links must be protected against link-layer address spoofing
      attacks in which an attacker on the link pretends to be a trusted
      neighbor. Links that provide link-layer securing mechanisms (e.g., WiFi
      networks) and links that provide physical security (e.g., enterprise
      network LANs) provide a first-line of defense that is often sufficient.
      In other instances, sufficient assurances against link-layer address
      spoofing attacks are possible if the source can digitally sign its
      messages through means outside the scope of this document.</t>

    <section anchor="scaling" title="Intermediate Router Interworking">
      <t><xref target="no-onlink-prefix-fig"></xref> depicts a reference AERO
      operational scenario with a single intermediate router on the AERO link.
      In order to support scaling to larger numbers of nodes, the AERO link
      can deploy multiple intermediate routers, e.g., as shown in <xref
      target="chaining-fig"></xref></t>

        </figure>In this example, the ingress AERO node ('B') (in this case an
      edge router, but could also be a host) associates with intermediate AERO
      router ('C'), while the egress AERO node ('F') (in this case an edge
      router, but could also be a host) associates with intermediate AERO
      router ('E'). Furthermore, intermediate routers ('C') and ('E') do not
      associate with each other directly, but rather have an association with
      a "core" router ('D') (i.e., a router that has full topology information
      concerning its associated intermediate routers). Core router 'D' may
      connect to either the AERO link, or to other physical or virtual links
      (not shown) to which intermediate routers 'C' and 'E' also connect.</t>

      <t>When host ('A') sends a packet toward destination host ('G'), IPv6
      forwarding directs the packet through the EUN to edge router ('B') which
      forwards the packet to intermediate router ('C') in absence of
      more-specific forwarding information. Intermediate router ('C') forwards
      the packet, and also generates an AERO Predirect message that is then
      forwarded through core router ('D') to intermediate router ('E'). When
      intermediate router ('E') receives the Predirect, it forwards the
      message to egress router ('F').</t>

      <t>After processing the AERO Predirect message, egress router ('F')
      sends an AERO Redirect message to intermediate router ('E').
      Intermediate router ('E') in turn forwards the message through core
      router ('D') to intermediate router ('C'). When intermediate router
      ('C') receives the Redirect, it forwards the message to ingress edge
      router ('B') informing it that host 'G's EUN can be reached via egress
      router 'F', thus completing the AERO redirection.</t>

      <t>The interworkings between intermediate and core routers (including
      the conveyance of pseudo Predirects and Redirects) must be carefully
      coordinated in a manner outside the scope of this document. In
      particular, the intermediate and core routers must ensure that any
      routing loops that may be formed are temporal in nature. See <xref
      target="I-D.templin-ironbis"></xref> for an architectural discussion of
      coordinations between intermediate and core routers.</t>

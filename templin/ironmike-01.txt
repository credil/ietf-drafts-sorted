Abstract

   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a new routing and
   addressing architecture based on encapsulation of inner network layer
   packets within outer network layer headers using a non-broadcast,
   multiple access (NBMA) virtual interface model.  The IKEv2 Mobility
   and Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE) allows a Virtual Private Network
   (VPN) client to keep a connection to a VPN gateway active across
   multiple network points of attachment or while moving from one
   network point of attachment to another.  This document examines the
   similarities between IRON and MOBIKE, and observes that they are
   addressing the same fundamental networking objectives.  It further
   proposes ways in which the basic MOBIKE model could be extended
   through adoption of IRON architectural constructs.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) [RFC6179] is a new
   routing and addressing architecture based on encapsulation of inner
   network layer packets within outer network layer headers using a non-
   broadcast, multiple access (NBMA) virtual interface model.  It allows
   client routers to keep a connection to their serving routers active
   across multiple network points of attachment or while moving from one
   network point of attachment to another.  IRON provides end user
   networks (EUN) with stable IP prefixes taken from a home virtual
   overlay network aggregated prefix that can be used across multiple
   ISP connections with support for mobility and multihoming.  IRON
   clients use bidirectional tunnels to connect to their home servers,
   and use unidirectional tunnels to forward packets to servers that are
   closer to the final destination.  In this arrangement, the clients
   can access resources in the virtual overlay network and/or Internet
   as well as connect to other clients using the virtual overlay network
   as a transit.

   The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol [RFC4306] and its
   associated IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE) [RFC4555]
   provide a Virtual Private Network (VPN) management system for
   managing IP Security Protocol (IPsec) tunnels [RFC4301].  As an
   adjunct to IKEv2, MOBIKE allows client routers to keep a connection
   to a serving router active across multiple network points of
   attachment or while moving from one network point of attachment to
   another.  MOBIKE establishes and maintains bidirectional VPN tunnels
   to connect mobile and/or multihomed clients and their EUNs to servers
   in a home enterprise network.  The EUNs can then use stable IP
   prefixes taken from the home enterprise network's address space even
   if the tunnels connect across multiple ISP connections.  In this
   arrangement, the clients can access resources in the enterprise
   network and/or Internet as well as connect to other clients using the
   enterprise network as a transit.

   This document examines the similarities between IRON and MOBIKE, and
   observes that they are addressing the same fundamental networking
   objectives.  It further proposes ways in which the basic MOBIKE model
   could be extended through adoption of IRON architectural constructs.


2.  IRON Conceptual Model

   IRON is descended from the RANGER architecture [RFC5720][RFC6139]; it
   uses Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) [I-D.templin-intarea-vet] and
   the Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL)
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal] as its functional building blocks.  IRON
   uses the VET NBMA virtual interface model for coordination between

   neighboring routers in a virtual overlay network.  It also uses SEAL
   as an IP-in-IP encapsulation sublayer, and uses the SEAL Control
   Message Protocol (SCMP) for signaling between tunnel endpoints.  In
   particular, IRON clients use SEAL and SCMP to establish bidirectional
   tunnels with their home servers and to inform the servers of any
   outer network layer address changes.  IRON also uses unidirectional
   tunnels to forward packets to servers that are closer to the final
   destination.

   IRON clients connect End User Networks (EUNs) which are assigned EUN
   prefixes (EPs) taken from highly-aggregated IP prefixes known as
   Virtual Prefixes (VPs).  IRON servers connect their clients to a
   virtual overlay network configured over an internetwork such as the
   global Internet.  IRON relays in turn connect the virtual overlay
   network to the native (i.e., non-IRON) Internet.  The IRON relays in
   the virtual overlay network belong to a single Autonomous System (AS)
   and use eBGP to advertise the VPs externally into the native Internet
   default-free routing system.  IRON relays and servers further use an
   interior routing protocol such as iBGP to track the EPs assigned to
   clients.

   To provide better service to clients, sufficient numbers of IRON
   relays and servers should be uniformly distributed throughout the
   internetwork over which the virtual overlay network is configured.
   Since the number of IRON servers needed may be substantial, each
   server is required only to keep track of its own set of clients and
   to convey its client constituency to each of the relays.  The
   interior routing between servers and relays is therefore arranged as
   a partial mesh in which servers have partial topology information and
   relays have full topology information.  In this partial topology
   arrangement, routing within the virtual overlay network may direct
   the initial packets in a flow through a suboptimal path that involves
   extraneous relays and servers as intermediate hops, but redirection
   messages will quickly inform the client of a better route
   [I-D.templin-aero].

   The three basic packet flow archetypes supported by this model
   include:

   1.  From a host A in IRON EUN A to a host B in IRON EUN B

   2.  From a host A in IRON EUN A to a host C in the Internet

   3.  From a host C in the Internet to a host A in IRON EUN A

   In case 1, the initial packets in the flow sourced from host A are
   forwarded through the bidirectional tunnel between the client and
   server connecting EUN A to the virtual overlay network.  The server



Templin                 Expires November 17, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                          May 2011


   then forwards the packets to a relay, which returns redirection
   messages and forwards the packets further to the server that serves
   EUN B. The EUN B server then forwards the packets via the
   bidirectional tunnel to the client connecting EUN B to the virtual
   overlay network, where they are delivered to host B. Following
   redirection, subsequent packets flow directly via a unidirectional
   tunnel from the EUN A client to the EUN B server while bypassing the
   relay and EUN A server.

   In case 2, packets sourced from host A are forwarded through the
   bidirectional tunnel between the client and server, then forwarded to
   a relay that connects the virtual overlay network to the rest of the
   Internet.  The packets are then forwarded via normal Internet routing
   until they reach host C.

   In case 3, packets sourced from host C are forwarded through normal
   Internet routing until they reach a relay that connects the virtual
   overlay network to the rest of the Internet.  The relay then forwards
   the packets to the correct server, where they are forwarded through
   the bidirectional tunnel to the client then delivered to host A.

   These fundamental packet flow archetypes apply to the case of IRON
   virtual overlay networks which connect tunnel endpoints that do not
   use symmetric securing mechanisms.  However, the same archetypes
   apply when the virtual overlay network consists of a system of VPN
   tunnels such as in the MOBIKE conceptual model described in the next
   section.


3.  MOBIKE Conceptual Model

   VPN clients use the Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol [RFC4306]
   to set up IPsec [RFC4301] security associations with VPN servers.
   The client then uses the security association to create a
   bidirectional VPN tunnel to the server, which in turn connects the
   VPN to a protected enterprise network.  Using MOBIKE, the client can
   then register multiple tunnel endpoint locator addresses with the
   server (e.g., one address per access technology link) and can change
   its set of locator addresses as it breaks connections with old access
   technology links and forms connections with new ones.  Hence,
   multihoming and mobility are naturally supported.

   The VPN client and all of the devices in its associated EUN then
   receive IP address/prefix configurations as though they were a
   virtual extension of the protected enterprise network ,and can access
   any available services and resources within the enterprise network.
   This could include services and resources both inside the protected
   enterprise network and within other EUNs connected by other VPN

   tunnels.  For example, hosts behind a VPN client router located in
   Phoenix could connect to hosts behind a VPN client router located in
   Miami using a protected enterprise network that spans the continental
   United States as a secure transit network.  This model is seen in
   common practice today for large corporate enterprise networks with
   their associated branch offices and nomadic laptop users.

   The protected enterprise network may be completely isolated, or it
   may further connect to the public Internet via firewalls, proxies
   and/or packet filtering gateways of some form.  These secure gateway
   devices in the MOBIKE conceptual model correspond directly to the
   relay function found in the IRON conceptual model.  Indeed, the same
   three packet flow archetypes described above for the IRON conceptual
   model apply also to the MOBIKE conceptual model.  When the protected
   enterprise network comprises native links and ordinary IP routing
   (i.e., as opposed to a strict full/partial mesh of tunnels), a fourth
   packet flow archetype is enabled in which simple hosts within the
   protected enterprise network can participate.


4.  IRON and MOBIKE Comparison

   The obvious fundamental distinction between the IRON and MOBIKE
   conceptual models lies in the nature of their respective tunneling
   models.  In the basic IRON model, tunnels are created using the SCMP,
   and tunneled packets are identified by a tunnel ID nonce that can be
   used to defeat off-path attacks.  Unlike the VPN tunnels used by
   MOBIKE, however, the basic IRON tunnel model does not provide for
   authentication, integrity and confidentiality; hence, it is open to
   on-path attacks and/or eavesdropping.  The basic IRON security model
   may be sufficient for certain scenarios (e.g., open Internet access
   for ISP customers) while the VPN tunnel model used by MOBIKE may be
   required for others (e.g., nomadic user access to protected corporate
   IT infrastructure resources).

   Aside from the fundamental tunneling model distinction, the IRON and
   MOBIKE conceptual models share striking similarities in their
   networking models.  First, IRON and MOBIKE clients locate nearby
   servers through some form of service discovery and use the SCMP and
   MOBIKE signaling mechanisms (respectively) to coordinate their tunnel
   endpoint locator addresses with the servers to support mobility and
   multihoming.  Moreover, the IRON virtual overlay network and the
   MOBIKE protected enterprise network models fulfill the same roles
   from the viewpoint of the clients - both networking abstractions
   provide transit service allowing hosts behind clients to participate
   in the communication flow archetypes discussed in Section 2 above.
   Finally, the IRON relays and MOBIKE enterprise network firewalls/
   proxies/packet filtering gateways provide the means for hosts to

5.  IRON Extensions for MOBIKE

   The basic MOBIKE model is agnostic to the routing architecture of the
   protected enterprise network.  As long as the enterprise network
   routing system ensures reachability for any desired resources or
   services, the basic service requirements for MOBIKE clients are
   satisfied.  However, the basic MOBIKE model does not address the
   requirement for a mobile VPN client to maintain generally shortest-
   path routes which can be maintained only if the mobile client has a
   means for transporting its VPN endpoint from a former serving gateway
   to one that is topologically closer.  In the IRON model, this tunnel
   endpoint mobility is naturally supported by the SCMP signaling
   protocol in a manner that could be applied equally to MOBIKE.

   If MOBIKE VPN clients were allowed to change between serving VPN
   gateways, however, these changes would need to be disseminated as
   updates in the protected enterprise network routing system.
   Depending on the number of mobile clients and the nature of the
   enterprise network routing system, such mobility could impart
   unacceptable routing churn.  In order to address this routing churn,

   the MOBIKE enterprise network could adopt the IRON routing model of
   using a dynamic routing protocol over a partial mesh of tunnels
   between relays and servers to prevent localized mobility events from
   imparting churn to the entire enterprise network routing system.

   IRON further uses the AERO redirection capability [I-D.templin-aero]
   so that unnecessary forwarding hops through servers and relays can be
   eliminated.  With reference to Figure 3, in the IRON model when
   Host(A) sends a packet to Host(C), the packet flows through the
   bidirectional tunnel between Client(A) and Server(A).  Server(A) then
   forwards the packet through Relay(B), which forwards the packet to
   Server(C) and also returns a redirection message.  Server(A) in turn
   forwards the redirect to Client(A) which can then forward future
   packets via a unidirectional tunnel directly to Server(C) thus
   effectively bypassing the unnecessary hops through Server(A) and
   Relay(B).  In the MOBIKE model, however, this form of route

   necessary IKEv2 transactions to establish a security association.

   MOBIKE deployments could therefore benefit from using either a full
   or partial route optimization capability modeled after IRON depending
   on the particular deployment scenario.  For example, in scenarios in
   which all VPN clients and gateways either share a full set of
   security associations or can establish security associations quickly,
   the full IRON route optimization model can be used.  Otherwise, a
   protected enterprise network servicing MOBIKE clients could support a
   partial route optimization in which a Server(A) would process the
   redirect message sent by Relay(B) without forwarding it on to
   Client(A).  Server(A) could then forward packets directly to
   Server(C) while bypassing Relay(B) in order to provide a shorter
   path.  However, this approach may require Server(A) to maintain
   considerable dynamic routing state due to route optimization if it
   services many clients and/or those clients connect to many
   correspondents.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for IRON and MOBIKE appear in their
   respective documents.


8.  Acknowledgements

   Dave Thaler and Gabriel Montenegro mentioned that MOBIKE addresses
   mobility and multihoming, and therefore may be related to the IRON
   solution space.

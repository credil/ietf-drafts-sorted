    <abstract>
      <t>Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth due to
      increasing demand, it is clear that current routing architectures and
      operational practices must be updated. This document proposes an
      Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) architecture that supports
      sustainable growth while requiring no changes to end systems and no
      changes to the existing routing system. IRON further addresses other
      important issues including routing scaling, mobility management,
      multihoming, traffic engineering and NAT traversal. While business
      considerations are an important determining factor for widespread
      adoption, they are out of scope for this document.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Growth in the number of entries instantiated in the Internet routing
      system has led to concerns regarding unsustainable routing scaling <xref
      target="RADIR"></xref>. Operational practices such as the increased use
      of multihoming with Provider-Independent (PI) addressing are resulting
      in more and more fine-grained prefixes being injected into the routing
      system from more and more end user networks. Furthermore, depletion of
      the public IPv4 address space has raised concerns for both increased
      address space fragmentation (leading to yet further routing table
      entries) and an impending address space run-out scenario. At the same
      time, the IPv6 routing system is beginning to see growth <xref
      target="BGPMON"></xref> which must be managed in order to avoid the same
      routing scaling issues the IPv4 Internet now faces. Since the Internet
      must continue to scale to accommodate increasing demand, it is clear
      that new routing methodologies and operational practices are needed.</t>

      <t>Several related works have investigated routing scaling issues.
      Virtual Aggregation (VA) <xref target="GROW-VA"></xref> and Aggregation
      in Increasing Scopes (AIS) <xref target="EVOLUTION"></xref> are global
      routing proposals that introduce routing overlays with Virtual Prefixes
      (VPs) to reduce the number of entries required in each router's
      Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and Routing Information Base (RIB).
      Routing and Addressing in Networks with Global Enterprise Recursion
      (RANGER) <xref target="RFC5720"></xref> examines recursive arrangements
      of enterprise networks that can apply to a very broad set of use-case
      scenarios <xref target="RFC6139"></xref>. IRON specifically adopts the
      RANGER Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) tunnel virtual-interface
      model, and uses Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) <xref
      target="INTAREA-VET"></xref> and the Subnetwork Adaptation and
      Encapsulation Layer (SEAL) <xref target="INTAREA-SEAL"></xref> as its
      functional building blocks.</t>

      <t>This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON)
      architecture with goals of supporting sustainable growth while requiring
      no changes to the existing routing system. IRON borrows concepts from VA
      and AIS, and further borrows concepts from the Internet Vastly Improved
      Plumbing (Ivip) <xref target="IVIP-ARCH"></xref> architecture proposal
      along with its associated Translating Tunnel Router (TTR) mobility
      extensions <xref target="TTRMOB"></xref>. Indeed, the TTR model to a
      great degree inspired the IRON mobility architecture design discussed in
      this document. The Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal techniques
      adapted for IRON were inspired by the Simple Address Mapping for
      Premises Legacy Equipment (SAMPLE) proposal <xref
      target="SAMPLE"></xref>.</t>

      <t>IRON supports scalable addressing without changing the current BGP
      <xref target="RFC4271"></xref> routing system. IRON observes the
      Internet Protocol standards <xref target="RFC0791"></xref><xref
      target="RFC2460"></xref>. Other network-layer protocols that can be
      encapsulated within IP packets (e.g., OSI/CLNP (Connectionless Network
      Protocol) <xref target="RFC1070"></xref>, etc.) are also within
      scope.</t>

      <t>IRON is a global routing system comprising Virtual Service Provider
      (VSP) overlay networks that service Virtual Prefixes (VPs) from which
      End User Network (EUN) prefixes (EPs) are delegated to customer sites.
      IRON is motivated by a growing customer demand for multihoming, mobility
      management, and traffic engineering while using stable addressing to
      minimize dependence on network renumbering <xref
      target="RFC4192"></xref><xref target="RFC5887"></xref>. IRON VSP overlay
      network instances use the existing IPv4 and IPv6 global Internet routing
      systems as virtual NBMA links for tunneling inner network protocol
      packets within outer IPv4 or IPv6 headers (see Section 3). Each IRON
      instance requires deployment of a small number of new BGP core routers
      and supporting servers, as well as IRON-aware clients in customer EUNs.
      No modifications to hosts, and no modifications to most routers, are
      required. The following sections discuss details of the IRON
      architecture.</t>

    <section anchor="iron" title="The Internet Routing Overlay Network">
      <t>The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a union of Virtual
      Service Provider (VSP) overlay network instances connected to a common
      Internetwork. While the principles presented in this document are
      discussed within the context of the public global Internet, they can
      also be applied to any autonomous Internetwork. The rest of this
      document therefore refers to the terms "Internet" and "Internetwork"
      interchangeably except in cases where specific distinctions must be
      made.</t>

      <t>Each IRON instance consists of IRON Agents (IAs) that automatically
      tunnel the packets of end-to-end communication sessions within
      encapsulating headers used for Internet routing. IAs use the Virtual
      Enterprise Traversal (VET) <xref target="INTAREA-VET"></xref> virtual
      NBMA link model in conjunction with the Subnetwork Encapsulation and
      Adaptation Layer (SEAL) <xref target="INTAREA-SEAL"></xref> to

        </figure></t>

      <t>VET specifies the automatic tunneling mechanisms used for
      encapsulation, while SEAL specifies the format and usage of the SEAL
      header as well as a set of control messages. Most notably, IAs use the
      SEAL Control Message Protocol (SCMP) to deterministically exchange and
      authenticate control messages such as route redirections, indications of
      Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) limitations, destination
      unreachables, etc. IAs appear as neighbors on an NBMA virtual link, and
      form bidirectional and/or unidirectional tunnel-neighbor
      relationships.</t>

      <t>Each IRON instance comprises a set of IAs distributed throughout the
      Internet to serve highly aggregated Virtual Prefixes (VPs). VSPs
      delegate sub-prefixes from their VPs, which they lease to customers as
      End User Network Prefixes (EPs). In turn, the customers assign the EPs
      to their customer edge IAs, which connect their End User Networks (EUNs)
      to the VSP IRON instance.</t>

      <t>VSPs may have no affiliation with the ISP networks from which
      customers obtain their basic Internet connectivity. Therefore, a
      customer could procure its summary network services either through a
      common provider or through separate entities. In that case, the VSP can
      open for business and begin serving its customers immediately without
      the need to coordinate its activities with ISPs or other VSPs. Further
      details on business considerations are out of scope for this
      document.</t>

      <t>IRON requires no changes to end systems or to most routers in the
      Internet. Instead, IAs are deployed either as new platforms or as
      modifications to existing platforms. IAs may be deployed incrementally
      without disturbing the existing Internet routing system, and act as
      waypoints (or "cairns") for navigating VSP overly networks. The
      functional roles for IAs are described in the following sections.</t>

      <section title="IRON Client">
        <t>An IRON client (or, simply, "Client") is a customer's router or
        host that logically connects the customer's EUNs and their associated
        EPs to the VSP IRON instance via tunnels, as shown in <xref
        target="IREP"></xref>. Client routers obtain EPs from VSPs and use
        them to number subnets and interfaces within their EUNs. A Client can
        be deployed on the same physical platform that also connects the
        customer's EUNs to its ISPs, but it may also be a separate router or
        even a standalone server system located within the EUN. (This model
        applies even if the EUN connects to the ISP via a Network Address
        Translator (NAT) -- see Section 6.7). Finally, a Client may also be a
        simple end system that connects a singleton EUN and exhibits the
        outward appearance of a host.</t>

        </figure>Each Relay connects the IRON instance directly to the
      underlying IPv4 and IPv6 Internets. It also advertises the VSP's IPv4
      VPs into the IPv4 BGP routing system and advertises the VSP's IPv6 VPs
      into the IPv6 BGP routing system. Relays will therefore receive packets
      with EPA destination addresses sent by end systems in the Internet and
      direct them toward EPA-addressed end systems connected to the VSP's IRON
      instance.</t>

      <t>Each VSP also manages a set of Servers that connect their Clients and
      associated EUNs to the IRON instance and to the IPv6 and IPv4 Internets
      via their associations with Relays. IRON Servers therefore need not be
      BGP routers themselves; they can be simple commodity hardware platforms.
      Moreover, the Server and Relay functions can be deployed together on the
      same physical platform as a unified gateway, or they may be deployed on
      separate platforms (e.g., for load balancing purposes).</t>

      <t>Each Server maintains a working set of bidirectional tunnel-neighbor
      Clients for which it caches EP-to-Client mappings in its Forwarding
      Information Base (FIB). Each Server also, in turn, propagates the list
      of EPs in its working set to each of the Relays in the IRON instance via
      a dynamic routing protocol (e.g., an overlay network internal BGP
      instance that carries only the EP-to-Server mappings and does not
      interact with the external BGP routing system). Therefore, each Server
      only needs to track the EPs for its current working set of Clients,
      while each Relay will maintain a full EP-to-Server mapping table that
      represents reachability information for all EPs in the VSP overlay
      network.</t>

      <t>Customers establish Clients that obtain their basic Internet
      connectivity from ISPs and connect to Servers to attach their EUNs to
      the IRON instance. Each EUN can further connect to the IRON instance via
      multiple Clients as long as the Clients coordinate with one another,
      e.g., to mitigate EUN partitions. Unlike Relays and Servers, Clients may
      use private addresses behind one or several layers of NATs. Each Client
      initially discovers a list of nearby Servers through an anycast
      discovery process (described below). It then selects one of these nearby
      Servers and forms a bidirectional tunnel-neighbor relationship with the
      server through an initial exchange followed by periodic keepalives.</t>

      <t>After the Client selects a Server, it forwards initial outbound
      packets from its EUNs by tunneling them to the Server, which, in turn,
      forwards them to the nearest Relay within the IRON instance. The Client
      may subsequently receive redirect messages informing it of a more direct
      route through a different Server within the IRON instance that serves
      the final destination EUN. This Server in turn provides a unidirectional
      tunnel-neighbor egress for route optimization purposes,.</t>

      <t>The IRON can also be used to support VPs of network-layer address
      families that cannot be routed natively in the underlying Internetwork
      (e.g., OSI/CLNP over the public Internet, IPv6 over IPv4-only
      Internetworks, IPv4 over IPv6-only Internetworks, etc.). Further details
      for the support of IRON VPs of one address family over Internetworks
      based on other address families are discussed in Appendix A.</t>

    <section anchor="initialization" title="IRON Initialization">
      <t>IRON instance initialization entails the startup actions of IAs and
      customer EUNs. The following sub-sections discuss these startup
      procedures.</t>

      <section title="IRON Relay Router Initialization">
        <t>Before its first operational use, each IRON Relay is provisioned
        with the list of VPs that it will serve as well as the locators for
        all Servers within the IRON instance. The Relay is also provisioned
        with external BGP interconnections -- the same as for any BGP
        router.</t>

        <t>Upon startup, the Relay engages in BGP routing exchanges with its
        peers in the IPv4 and IPv6 Internets the same as for any BGP router.
        It then connects to all of the Servers in the overlay network (e.g.,
        via a TCP connection over a bidirectional tunnel, via an Internal BGP
        (IBGP) route reflector, etc.) for the purpose of discovering
        EP-to-Server mappings. After the Relay has fully populated its
        EP-to-Server mapping information database, it is said to be
        "synchronized" with regard to its VPs.</t>

        <t>After this initial synchronization procedure, the Relay then
        advertises the overlay network's VPs externally. In particular, the
        Relay advertises the IPv6 VPs into the IPv6 BGP routing system and
        advertises the IPv4 VPs into the IPv4 BGP routing system. The Relay
        additionally advertises an IPv4 /24 companion prefix (e.g.,
        192.0.2.0/24) into the IPv4 routing system and an IPv6 ::/64 companion
        prefix (e.g., 2001:DB8::/64) into the IPv6 routing system (note that
        these may also be sub-prefixes taken from a VP). The Relay then
        configures the host number '1' in the IPv4 companion prefix (e.g., as
        192.0.2.1) and the interface identifier '0' in the IPv6 companion
        prefix (e.g., as 2001:DB8::0), and it assigns the resulting addresses
        as "Relay anycast" addresses for the IRON instance. (See Appendix A
        for more information on the discovery and use of companion prefixes.)
        The Relay then engages in ordinary packet-forwarding operations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IRON Serving Router Initialization">
        <t>Before its first operational use, each IRON Server is provisioned
        with the locators for all Relays within the IRON instance. Upon
        startup, each Server must connect to all of the Relays within the IRON
        instance (e.g., via a TCP connection, via an IBGP route reflector,
        etc.) for the purpose of reporting its EP-to-Server mappings. The
        Server then actively listens for Client customers that register their
        EP prefixes as part of establishing a bidirectional tunnel-neighbor
        relationship. When a new Client connects, the Server announces the new
        EP additions to all Relays; when an existing Client disconnects, the
        Server withdraws its announcements.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="EUN" title="IRON Client Initialization">
        <t>Before its first operational use, each Client must obtain one or
        more EPs from its VSP as well as the companion prefixes associated
        with the VSP's IRON instance (see Section 5.1). The Client must also
        obtain a certificate and a public/private key pair from the VSP that
        it can later use to prove ownership of its EPs. This implies that each
        VSP must run its own public key infrastructure to be used only for the
        purpose of verifying its customers' claimed right to use an EP. Hence,
        the VSP need not coordinate its public key infrastructure with any
        other organization.</t>

        <t>Upon startup, the Client sends an SCMP Router Solicitation (SRS)
        message to the VSP overlay network Relay anycast address to discover
        the nearest Relay. The Relay will return an SCMP Router Advertisement
        (SRA) message that lists the locator addresses of one or more nearby
        Servers. (This list is analogous to the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel
        Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) Potential Router List (PRL) <xref
        target="RFC5214"></xref>.)</t>

        <t>After the Client receives an SRA message from the nearby Relay
        listing the locator addresses of nearby Servers, it initiates a short
        transaction with one of the Servers carried by a reliable transport
        protocol such as TCP in order to establish a bidirectional
        tunnel-neighbor relationship. The protocol details of the transaction
        are specific to the VSP, and hence out of scope for this document.</t>

        <t>Note that it is essential that the Client select one and only one
        Server. This is to allow the VSP overlay network mapping system to
        have one and only one active EP-to-Server mapping at any point in
        time, which shares fate with the Server itself. If this Server fails,
        the Client can select a new one that will automatically update the VSP
        overlay network mapping system with a new EP-to-Server mapping.</t>

    <section anchor="operation" title="IRON Operation">
      <t>Following the initialization operations detailed in Section 5, IAs
      engage in the steady-state process of receiving and forwarding packets.
      All IAs forward encapsulated packets over the IRON instance using the
      mechanisms of VET <xref target="INTAREA-VET"></xref> and SEAL <xref
      target="INTAREA-SEAL"></xref>, while Relays additionally forward packets
      to and from the native IPv6 and IPv4 Internets. IAs also use SCMP to
      coordinate with other IAs, including the process of sending and
      receiving redirect messages, error messages, etc. (Note however that an
      IA must not send an SCMP message in response to an SCMP error message.)
      Each IA operates as specified in the following sub-sections.</t>

      <section title="IRON Client Operation">
        <t>After selecting its Server as specified in Section 5.3, the Client
        registers each of its active ISP connections with its IRON instance
        Server. To do so, it sends periodic beacons (e.g., cryptographically
        signed SRS messages) to the Server via each active ISP to maintain
        tunnel-neighbor address mapping state. The beacons should be sent at
        no more than 60 second intervals (subject to a small random delay) so
        that state in NATs on the path as well as on the Server itself is
        updated. Although the client may connect via multiple ISPs, a single
        tunnel-neighbor identifier ("NBR_ID") is used to represent the set of
        all ISP paths between the Client and the Server. The NBR_ID therefore
        names this "bundle" of tunnel-neighbor ISP connections.</t>

        <t>If the Client ceases to receive acknowledgements from its Server
        via a specific ISP connection, it marks the Server as unreachable from
        that ISP. (The Client should also inform the Server of this outage via
        one of its working ISP connections.) If the Client ceases to receive
        acknowledgements from the Server via multiple ISP connections, it
        marks the Server as unusable and quickly attempts to register with a
        new Server. The act of registering with a new Server will
        automatically purge the stale mapping state associated with the old
        Server, since dynamic routing will soon propagate the new
        Client/Server relationship among the IRON instance's Relay
        Routers.</t>

        <t>When an end system in an EUN sends a flow of packets to a
        correspondent, the packets are forwarded through the EUN via normal
        routing until they reach the Client, which then tunnels the initial
        packets to its Server as the next hop. In particular, the Client
        encapsulates each packet in an outer header with its locator as the
        source address and the locator of its Server as the destination
        address. Note that after sending the initial packets of a flow, the
        Client may receive important control messages, such as indications of
        PMTU limitations, redirect messages that indicate a better
        tunnel-neighbor next hop, etc.</t>

        <t>The Client uses the mechanisms specified in VET and SEAL to
        encapsulate each forwarded packet. The Client further uses the SCMP
        protocol to coordinate with Servers, including accepting redirects and
        other control messages. When the Client receives an SCMP message, it
        checks the NBR_ID field of the encapsulated packet-in-error to verify
        that the message corresponds to the tunnel-neighbor state for its
        Server.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IRON Serving Router Operation">
        <t>After the Server is initialized, it responds to SRS messages from
        tunnel-neighbor Clients by sending SRAs.</t>

        <t>When the Server receives a SEAL-encapsulated data packet from one
        of its bidirectional tunnel-neighbor Clients, it uses normal
        longest-prefix-match rules to locate a FIB entry that matches the
        packet's inner destination address. If the matching FIB entry is
        more-specific than default, the next hop is another tunnel-neighbor
        Client; otherwise, the next-hop is a Relay which serves as a default
        router. The Server then re-encapsulates the packet (i.e., it removes
        the outer header and replaces it with a new outer header of the same
        address family), sets the outer destination address to the locator
        address of the next hop and tunnels the packet to the next hop.</t>

        <t>When the Server receives a SEAL-encapsulated data packet from
        either a Relay or from a unidirectional tunnel-neighbor Client, it
        again locates a FIB entry that matches the packet's inner destination
        address. If the matching FIB entry is more-specific than default, the
        server re-encapsulates the packet and forwards it to the correct
        bidirectional tunnel-neighbor Client. If the Client has recently moved
        to a different Server, however, the Server also returns an SCMP
        redirect message listing a NULL next hop which informs the source that
        the Client has moved.</t>

        <t>After forwarding the packet into the tunnel, the Server may receive
        SCMP error or redirect messages. The Server then re-encapsulates the
        SCMP message and forwards it to the source of the original packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IRON Relay Router Operation">
        <t>After each Relay has synchronized its VPs (see Section 5.1) it
        advertises the full set of the company's VPs and companion prefixes
        into the IPv4 and IPv6 Internet BGP routing systems. These prefixes
        will be represented as ordinary routing information in the BGP, and
        any packets originating from the IPv4 or IPv6 Internet destined to an
        address covered by one of the prefixes will be forwarded to one of the
        VSP's Relays.</t>

        <t>When a Relay receives a packet from the Internet destined to an EPA
        covered by one of its VPs, it behaves as an ordinary IP router. In
        particular, the Relay looks in its FIB to discover a locator of the
        Server that serves the EP covering the destination address. The Relay
        then simply encapsulates the packet with its own locator as the outer
        source address and the locator of the Server as the outer destination
        address and forwards the packet to the Server.</t>

        <t>When a Relay receives a packet from the Internet destined to one of
        its Relay anycast addresses, it discards the packet if it is not SEAL
        encapsulated. If the packet is an SCMP SRS message, the Relay instead
        sends an SRA message back to the source listing the locator addresses
        of nearby Servers then discards the message. The Relay otherwise
        discards all other SCMP messages.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IRON Reference Operating Scenarios">
        <t>IRON supports communications when one or both hosts are located
        within EP-addressed EUNs. When both hosts are within the EUNs of the
        same VSP IRON instance, route redirections that eliminate unnecessary
        Servers and Relays from the path are possible. When only one host is
        within an IRON EUN, however, route optimization cannot be used. The
        following sections discuss the two scenarios.</t>

        <section title="Both Hosts within Same IRON Instance">
          <t>When both hosts are within EUNs served by the same VSP IRON
          instance, it is sufficient to consider the scenario in a
          unidirectional fashion, i.e., by tracing packet flows only in the
          forward direction from source host to destination host. The reverse
          direction can be considered separately and incurs the same
          considerations as for the forward direction.</t>

          <t>In this scenario, the initial packets of a flow produced by a
          source host within an EUN connected to the IRON instance by a Client
          must flow through both the Server of the source host and a Relay of
          the destination host, but route optimization can eliminate these
          elements from the path for subsequent packets in the flow. <xref
          target="example1"></xref> shows the flow of initial packets from
          host A to host B within EUNs of the same IRON instance:</t>

            </figure>With reference to <xref target="example1"></xref>, host A
          sends packets destined to host B via its network interface connected
          to EUN A.&nbsp; Routing within EUN A will direct the packets to
          Client(A) as a default router for the EUN, which then uses VET and
          SEAL to encapsulate them in outer headers with its locator address
          as the outer source address and the locator address of Server(A) as
          the outer destination address. Client(A) then simply forwards the
          encapsulated packets into its ISP network connection that provided
          its locator. The ISP will forward the encapsulated packets into the
          Internet without filtering since the (outer) source address is
          topologically correct. Once the packets have been forwarded into the
          Internet, routing will direct them to Server(A).</t>

          <t>Server(A) receives the encapsulated packets from Client(A) then
          rewrites the outer source address to one of its own locator
          addresses and rewrites the outer destination address to the address
          of a nearby IRON instance Relay(R). Server(A) then forwards the
          revised encapsulated packets into the Internet, where routing will
          direct them to Relay(R).</t>

          <t>Relay(R) will intercept the encapsulated packets from Server(A)
          then check its FIB to discover an entry that covers inner
          destination address B with Server(B) as the next hop. Relay(B) then
          returns SCMP redirect messages to Server(A) (*), rewrites the outer
          destination address of the encapsulated packets to the locator
          address of Server(B), and forwards these revised packets to
          Server(B).</t>

          <t>Server(B) will receive the encapsulated packets from Relay(R)
          then check its FIB to discover an entry that covers destination
          address B with Client(B) as the next hop. Server(B) then
          re-encapsulates the packets in a new outer header that uses the

          forward the redirects to Client(A), which will establish
          unidirectional tunnel-neighbor state and thereafter forward its

            <t>In this scenario, host A sends packets destined to host B via
            its network interface connected to IRON EUN A.&nbsp; Routing
            within EUN A will direct the packets to Client(A) as a default
            router for the EUN, which then uses VET and SEAL to encapsulate
            them in outer headers with its locator address as the outer source
            address and the locator address of Server(A) as the outer
            destination address. The ISP will pass the packets without
            filtering since the (outer) source address is topologically
            correct. Once the packets have been released into the native
            Internet, routing will direct them to Server(A).</t>

            <t>Server(A) receives the encapsulated packets from Client(A) then
            re-encapsulates and forwards them to Relay(A), which simply
            decapsulates them and forwards the unencapsulated packets into the
            Internet. Once the packets are released into the Internet, routing
            will direct them to the final destination B. (Note that Server(A)
            and Relay(A) are depicted in <xref target="example5"></xref> as
            two halves of a unified gateway. In that case, the "forwarding"
            between Server(A) and Relay(A) is a zero-instruction imaginary
            operation within the gateway.)</t>

          to a mobility event), it configures one or more new locators. If the
          Client has not moved far away from its previous network point of
          attachment, it simply informs its Server of any locator additions or
          deletions. This operation is performance sensitive and should be
          conducted immediately to avoid packet loss.</t>

          <t>If the Client has moved far away from its previous network point
          of attachment, however, it re-issues the anycast discovery procedure
          described in Section 6.1 to discover whether its candidate set of
          Servers has changed. If the Client's current Server is also included
          in the new list received from the VSP, this provides indication that
          the Client has not moved far enough to warrant changing to a new
          Server. Otherwise, the Client may wish to move to a new Server in
          order to reduce routing stretch. This operation is not performance
          critical, and therefore can be conducted over a matter of
          seconds/minutes instead of milliseconds/microseconds.</t>

          <t>To move to a new Server, the Client first engages in the EP
          registration process with the new Server, as described in Section
          5.3. The Client then informs its former Server that it has departed;
          again, via a VSP-specific reliable transaction. The former Server
          will then retain the (stale) FIB entries until their lifetime
          expires, allowing it to continue delivering packets to the Client
          for the short term while informing existing correspondents that the
          Client has moved.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Multihoming">
          <t>A Client may register multiple locators with its Server. It can
          assign metrics with its registrations to inform the Server of
          preferred locators, and it can select outgoing locators according to
          its local preferences. Therefore, multihoming is naturally
          supported.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Inbound Traffic Engineering">
          <t>A Client can dynamically adjust the priorities of its prefix
          registrations with its Server in order to influence inbound traffic
          flows. It can also change between Servers when multiple Servers are
          available, but should strive for stability in its Server selection
          in order to limit VSP network routing churn.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Outbound Traffic Engineering">
          <t>A Client can select outgoing locators, e.g., based on current
          Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as minimizing one-way
          delay or one-way delay variance.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Renumbering Considerations">
        <t>As new link-layer technologies and/or service models emerge,
        customers will be motivated to select their service providers through
        healthy competition between ISPs. If a customer's EUN addresses are
        tied to a specific ISP, however, the customer may be forced to undergo
        a painstaking EUN renumbering process if it wishes to change to a
        different ISP <xref target="RFC4192"></xref><xref
        target="RFC5887"></xref>.</t>

        <t>When a customer obtains EP prefixes from a VSP, it can change
        between ISPs seamlessly and without need to renumber. If the VSP
        itself applies unreasonable costing structures for use of the EPs,
        however, the customer may be compelled to seek a different VSP and
        would again be required to confront a renumbering scenario.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="NAT Traversal Considerations">
        <t>The Internet today consists of a global public IPv4 routing and
        addressing system with non-IRON EUNs that use either public or private
        IPv4 addressing. The latter class of EUNs connect to the public
        Internet via Network Address Translators (NATs). When a Client is
        located behind a NAT, it selects Servers using the same procedures as
        for Clients with public addresses, e.g., it can send SRS messages to
        Servers in order to get SRA messages in return. The only requirement
        is that the Client must configure its SEAL encapsulation to use a
        transport protocol that supports NAT traversal, e.g., UDP, TCP, SSL,
        etc.</t>

        <t>Since the Server maintains state about its Client customers, it can
        discover locator information for each Client by examining the UDP port
        number and IP address in the outer headers of the Client's
        encapsulated SRS packets. When there is a NAT in the path, the
        transport port number and IP address in each encapsulated packet will
        correspond to state in the NAT box and might not correspond to the
        actual values assigned to the Client. The Server can then encapsulate
        packets destined to hosts in the Client's EUN within outer headers
        that use this IP address and UDP port number. The NAT box will receive
        the packets, translate the values in the outer headers, then forward
        the packets to the Client. In this sense, the Server's "locator" for
        the Client consists of the concatenation of the IP address and
        transport port number.</t>

        <t>IRON does not introduce any new issues to complications raised for
        NAT traversal or for applications embedding address referrals in their
        payload.</t>

      <section title="Multicast Considerations">
        <t>IRON Servers and Relays are topologically positioned to provide
        Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) / Multicast Listener
        Discovery (MLD) proxying for their Clients <xref
        target="RFC4605"></xref>. Further multicast considerations for IRON
        (e.g., interactions with multicast routing protocols, traffic scaling,
        etc.) will be discussed in a separate document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Nested EUN Considerations">
        <t>Each Client configures a locator that may be taken from an ordinary
        non-EPA address assigned by an ISP or from an EPA address taken from
        an EP assigned to another Client. In that case, the Client is said to
        be "nested" within the EUN of another Client, and recursive nestings
        of multiple layers of encapsulations may be necessary.</t>

        <t>For example, in the network scenario depicted in <xref
        target="nest"></xref>, Client(A) configures a locator EPA(B) taken
        from the EP assigned to EUN(B). Client(B) in turn configures a locator
        EPA(C) taken from the EP assigned to EUN(C). Finally, Client(C)
        configures a locator ISP(D) taken from a non-EPA address delegated by
        an ordinary ISP(D). Using this example, the "nested-IRON" case must be
        examined in which a host A, which configures the address EPA(A) within
        EUN(A), exchanges packets with host Z located elsewhere in the
        Internet.</t>

        <t>The two cases of host A sending packets to host Z, and host Z
        sending packets to host A, must be considered separately, as described
        below.</t>

        <section title="Host A Sends Packets to Host Z">
          <t>Host A first forwards a packet with source address EPA(A) and
          destination address Z into EUN(A). Routing within EUN(A) will direct
          the packet to Client(A), which encapsulates it in an outer header
          with EPA(B) as the outer source address and Server(A) as the outer
          destination address then forwards the once-encapsulated packet into
          EUN(B). Routing within EUN(B) will direct the packet to Client(B),
          which encapsulates it in an outer header with EPA(C) as the outer
          source address and Server(B) as the outer destination address then
          forwards the twice-encapsulated packet into EUN(C). Routing within
          EUN(C) will direct the packet to Client(C), which encapsulates it in
          an outer header with ISP(D) as the outer source address and
          Server(C) as the outer destination address. Client(C) then sends
          this triple-encapsulated packet into the ISP(D) network, where it
          will be routed into the Internet to Server(C).</t>

          <t>When Server(C) receives the triple-encapsulated packet, it
          removes the outer layer of encapsulation and forwards the resulting
          twice-encapsulated packet into the Internet to Server(B). Next,
          Server(B) removes the outer layer of encapsulation and forwards the
          resulting once-encapsulated packet into the Internet to Server(A).
          Next, Server(A) checks the address type of the inner address 'Z'. If
          Z is a non-EPA address, Server(A) simply decapsulates the packet and
          forwards it into the Internet. Otherwise, Server(A) rewrites the
          outer source and destination addresses of the once-encapsulated
          packet and forwards it to Relay(Z). Relay(Z), in turn, rewrites the
          outer destination address of the packet to the locator for
          Server(Z), then forwards the packet and sends a redirect to
          Server(A) (which forwards the redirect to Client(A)). Server(Z) then
          re-encapsulates the packet and forwards it to Client(Z), which
          decapsulates it and forwards the inner packet to host Z.&nbsp;
          Subsequent packets from Client(A) will then use Server(Z) as the
          next hop toward host Z, which eliminates Server(A) and Relay(Z) from
          the path.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Host Z Sends Packets to Host A">
          <t>Whether or not host Z configures an EPA address, its packets
          destined to host A will eventually reach Server(A). Server(A) will
          have a mapping that lists Client(A) as the next hop toward EPA(A).
          Server(A) will then encapsulate the packet with EPA(B) as the outer
          destination address and forward the packet into the Internet.
          Internet routing will convey this once-encapsulated packet to
          Server(B), which will have a mapping that lists Client(B) as the
          next hop toward EPA(B). Server(B) will then encapsulate the packet
          with EPA(C) as the outer destination address and forward the packet
          into the Internet. Internet routing will then convey this
          twice-encapsulated packet to Server(C), which will have a mapping
          that lists Client(C) as the next hop toward EPA(C). Server(C) will
          then encapsulate the packet with ISP(D) as the outer destination
          address and forward the packet into the Internet. Internet routing
          will then convey this triple-encapsulated packet to Client(C).</t>

          <t>When the triple-encapsulated packet arrives at Client(C), it
          strips the outer layer of encapsulation and forwards the
          twice-encapsulated packet to EPA(C), which is the locator address of
          Client(B). When Client(B) receives the twice-encapsulated packet, it
          strips the outer layer of encapsulation and forwards the
          once-encapsulated packet to EPA(B), which is the locator address of
          Client(A). When Client(A) receives the once-encapsulated packet, it
          strips the outer layer of encapsulation and forwards the
          unencapsulated packet to EPA(A), which is the host address of host
          A.</t>

    <section title="Implications for the Internet">
      <t>The IRON architecture envisions a hybrid routing/mapping system that
      benefits from both the shortest-path routing afforded by pure dynamic
      routing systems and the routing-scaling suppression afforded by pure
      mapping systems. Therefore, IRON targets the elusive "sweet spot" that
      pure routing and pure mapping systems alone cannot satisfy.</t>

      <t>The IRON system requires a VSP deployment of new routers/servers
      throughout the Internet to maintain well-balanced virtual overlay
      networks. These routers/servers can be deployed incrementally without
      disruption to existing Internet infrastructure and appropriately managed
      to provide acceptable service levels to customers.</t>

      <t>End-to-end traffic that traverses an IRON virtual overlay network may
      experience delay variance between the initial packets and subsequent
      packets of a flow. This is due to the IRON system allowing a longer path
      stretch for initial packets followed by timely route optimizations to
      utilize better next hop routers/servers for subsequent packets.</t>

      <t>IRON virtual overlay networks also work seamlessly with existing and
      emerging services within the native Internet. In particular, customers
      serviced by IRON virtual overlay networks will receive the same service
      enjoyed by customers serviced by non-IRON service providers. Internet
      services already deployed within the native Internet also need not make
      any changes to accommodate IRON virtual overlay network customers.</t>

      <t>The IRON system operates between routers within provider networks and
      end user networks. Within these networks, the underlying paths traversed
      by the virtual overlay networks may comprise links that accommodate
      varying MTUs. While the IRON system imposes an additional per-packet
      overhead that may cause the size of packets to become slightly larger
      than the underlying path can accommodate, IRON routers have a method for
      naturally detecting and tuning out all instances of path MTU underruns.
      In some cases, these MTU underruns may need to be reported back to the
      original hosts; however, the system will also allow for MTUs much larger
      than those typically available in current Internet paths to be
      discovered and utilized as more links with larger MTUs are deployed.</t>

      <t>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the IRON system provides an
      in-built mobility management and multihoming capability that allows end
      user devices and networks to move about freely while both imparting
      minimal oscillations in the routing system and maintaining generally
      shortest-path routes. This mobility management is afforded through the
      very nature of the IRON customer/provider relationship, and therefore
      requires no adjunct mechanisms. The mobility management and multihoming
      capabilities are further supported by forward-path reachability
      detection that provides "hints of forward progress" in the same spirit
      as for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND).</t>

    <section anchor="research" title="Additional Considerations">
      <t>Considerations for the scalability of Internet Routing due to
      multihoming, traffic engineering, and provider-independent addressing
      are discussed in <xref target="RADIR"></xref>. Other scaling
      considerations specific to IRON are discussed in Appendix B.</t>

      <t>Route optimization considerations for mobile networks are found in
      <xref target="RFC5522"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="init" title="Related Initiatives">
      <t>IRON builds upon the concepts of the RANGER architecture <xref
      target="RFC5720"></xref> , and therefore inherits the same set of
      related initiatives. The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Routing
      Research Group (RRG) mentions IRON in its recommendation for a routing
      architecture <xref target="RFC6115"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Virtual Aggregation (VA) <xref target="GROW-VA"></xref> and
      Aggregation in Increasing Scopes (AIS) <xref target="EVOLUTION"></xref>
      provide the basis for the Virtual Prefix concepts.</t>

      <t>Internet Vastly Improved Plumbing (Ivip) <xref
      target="IVIP-ARCH"></xref> has contributed valuable insights, including
      the use of real-time mapping. The use of Servers as mobility anchor
      points is directly influenced by Ivip's associated TTR mobility
      extensions <xref target="TTRMOB"></xref>.</t>

      <t><xref target="RO-CR"></xref> discusses a route optimization approach
      using a Correspondent Router (CR) model. The IRON Server construct is
      similar to the CR concept described in this work; however, the manner in
      which customer EUNs coordinate with Servers is different and based on
      the redirection model associated with NBMA links.</t>

      <t>Numerous publications have proposed NAT traversal techniques. The NAT
      traversal techniques adapted for IRON were inspired by the Simple
      Address Mapping for Premises Legacy Equipment (SAMPLE) proposal <xref
      target="SAMPLE"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="secure" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security considerations that apply to tunneling in general are
      discussed in <xref target="V6OPS-TUN-SEC"></xref>. Additional
      considerations that apply also to IRON are discussed in RANGER <xref
      target="RFC5720"></xref> , VET <xref target="INTAREA-VET"></xref> and
      SEAL <xref target="INTAREA-SEAL"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The IRON system further depends on mutual authentication of IRON
      Clients to Servers and Servers to Relays. This is accomplished through
      initial authentication exchanges that establish tunnel-neighbor NBR_ID
      values that can be used to detect off-path attacks. As for all Internet
      communications, the IRON system also depends on Relays acting with
      integrity and not injecting false advertisements into the BGP (e.g., to
      mount traffic siphoning attacks).</t>

      <t>IRON Servers must ensure that any changes in a client's locator
      addresses are communicated only through an authenticated exchange that
      is not subject to replay. For this reason, Clients periodically send
      digitally-signed SRS messages to the Server. If the Client's locator
      address stays the same, the Server can accept the SRS message without
      verifying the signature as long as the NBR_ID of the SRS matches the
      Client. If the Client's locator address changes, the Server must verify
      the SRS message's signature before accepting the message. Once the
      message has been authenticated, the Server updates the client's locator
      address to the new address.</t>

      <t>Each IRON instance requires a means for assuring the integrity of the
      interior routing system so that all Relays and Servers in the overlay
      have a consistent view of Client&lt;-&gt;Server bindings. Finally,
      Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on IRON Relays and Servers can occur
      when packets with spoofed source addresses arrive at high data rates.
      However, this issue is no different than for any border router in the
      public Internet today.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)
            stresses the global routing system in a number of ways. One of the
            most costly stresses is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router
            hardware simply because the FIB has run out of space, and router
            vendors must design routers that have adequate FIB. FIB
            suppression is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT
            loading selected RIB entries into the FIB. Virtual Aggregation
            (VA) allows ISPs to shrink the FIBs of any and all routers, easily
            by an order of magnitude with negligible increase in path length
            and load. FIB suppression deployed autonomously by an ISP
            (cooperation between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist with
            legacy routers in the ISP. There are no changes from the 03
            version.</t>

            <t>Internet routing scalability has long been considered a serious
            problem. Although many efforts have been devoted to address this
            problem over the years, the IETF community as a whole is yet to
            achieve a shared understanding on what is the best way forward. In
            this draft, we step up a level to re-examine the problem and the
            ongoing efforts. we conclude that, to effectively solve the
            routing scalability problem, we first need a clear understanding
            on how to introduce solutions to the Internet which is a global
            scale deployed system. In this draft we sketch out our reasoning
            on the need for an evolutionary path towards scaling the global
            routing system, instead of attempting to introduce a brand new
            design.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Ivip (Internet Vastly Improved Plumbing) is a Core-Edge
            Separation solution to the routing scaling problem, for both IPv4
            and IPv6. It provides portable address "edge" address space which
            is suitable for multihoming and inbound traffic engineering (TE)
            to end-user networks of all types and sizes - in a manner which
            imposes far less load on the DFZ control plane than the only
            current method of achieving these benefits: separately advertised
            PI prefixes. Ivip includes two extensions for ITR-to-ETR tunneling
            without encapsulation and the Path MTU Discovery problems which
            result from encapsulation - one for IPv4 and the other for IPv6.
            Both involve modifying the IP header and require most DFZ routers
            to be upgraded. Ivip is a good basis for the TTR (Translating
            Tunnel Router) approach to mobility, in which mobile hosts retain
            an SPI micronet of one or more IPv4 addresses (or IPv6 /64s) no
            matter what addresses or access network they are using, including
            behind NAT and on SPI addresses. TTR mobility for both IPv4 and
            IPv6 involves generally optimal paths, works with unmodified
            correspondent hosts and supports all application protocols.</t>

            <t>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to
            roam and attach to different access networks without disrupting
            the ongoing sessions that nodes of the network may have. By
            extending the Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile Routers, nodes of the
            network are not required to support any kind of mobility, since
            packets must go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA)
            bi-directional tunnel. Communications from/to a mobile network
            have to traverse the Home Agent, and therefore better paths may be
            available. Additionally, this solution adds packet overhead, due
            to the encapsulation. This document describes an approach to the
            Route Optimisation for NEMO, based on the well-known concept of
            Correspondent Router. The solution aims at meeting the currently
            identified NEMO Route Optimisation requirements for Operational
            Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration. Based on the ideas that
            have been proposed in the past, as well as some other extensions,
            this document describes a Correspondent Router based solution,
            trying to identify the most important open issues. The main goal
            of this first version of the document is to describe an initial
            NEMO RO solution based on the deployment of Correspondent Routers
            and trigger the discussion within the MEXT WG about this kind of
            solution. This document (in an appendix) also analyses how a

            identified NEMO Route Optimisation requirements for Operational
            Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration.</t>

    <section title="IRON VPs over Internetworks with Different Address Families">
      <t>The IRON architecture leverages the routing system by providing
      generally shortest-path routing for packets with EPA addresses from VPs
      that match the address family of the underlying Internetwork. When the
      VPs are of an address family that is not routable within the underlying
      Internetwork, however, (e.g., when OSI/NSAP <xref
      target="RFC4548"></xref> VPs are used within an IPv4 Internetwork) a
      global mapping database is required to allow Servers to map VPs to
      companion prefixes taken from address families that are routable within
      the Internetwork. For example, an IPv6 VP (e.g., 2001:DB8::/32) could be
      paired with a companion IPv4 prefix (e.g., 192.0.2.0/24) so that
      encapsulated IPv6 packets can be forwarded over IPv4-only
      Internetworks.</t>

      <t>Every VP in the IRON must therefore be represented in a globally
      distributed Master VP database (MVPd) that maintains VP-to-companion
      prefix mappings for all VPs in the IRON. The MVPd is maintained by a
      globally managed assigned numbers authority in the same manner as the
      Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) currently maintains the
      master list of all top-level IPv4 and IPv6 delegations. The database can
      be replicated across multiple servers for load balancing, much in the
      same way that FTP mirror sites are used to manage software
      distributions.</t>

      <t>Upon startup, each Server discovers the full set of VPs for the IRON
      by reading the MVPd. The Server reads the MVPd from a nearby server and
      periodically checks the server for deltas since the database was last
      read. After reading the MVPd, the Server has a full list of
      VP-to-companion prefix mappings.</t>

      <t>The Server can then forward packets toward EPAs covered by a VP by
      encapsulating them in an outer header of the VP's companion prefix
      address family and using any address taken from the companion prefix as
      the outer destination address. The companion prefix therefore serves as
      an anycast prefix.</t>

      <t>Possible encapsulations in this model include IPv6-in-IPv4,
      IPv4-in-IPv6, OSI/CLNP-in-IPv6, OSI/CLNP-in-IPv4, etc.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Scaling Considerations">
      <t>Scaling aspects of the IRON architecture have strong implications for
      its applicability in practical deployments. Scaling must be considered
      along multiple vectors, including Interdomain core routing scaling,
      scaling to accommodate large numbers of customer EUNs, traffic scaling,
      state requirements, etc.</t>

      <t>In terms of routing scaling, each VSP will advertise one or more VPs
      into the global Internet routing system from which EPs are delegated to
      customer EUNs. Routing scaling will therefore be minimized when each VP
      covers many EPs. For example, the IPv6 prefix 2001:DB8::/32 contains
      2^24 ::/56 EP prefixes for assignment to EUNs; therefore, the IRON could
      accommodate 2^32 ::/56 EPs with only 2^8 ::/32 VPs advertised in the
      interdomain routing core. (When even longer EP prefixes are used, e.g.,
      /64s assigned to individual handsets in a cellular provider network,
      considerable numbers of EUNs can be represented within only a single
      VP.) Each VP also has an associated anycast companion prefix; hence,
      there will be one anycast prefix advertised into the global routing
      system for each VP.</t>

      <t>In terms of traffic scaling for Relays, each Relay represents an ASBR
      of a "shell" enterprise network that simply directs arriving traffic
      packets with EPA destination addresses towards Servers that service
      customer EUNs. Moreover, the Relay sheds traffic destined to EPAs
      through redirection, which removes it from the path for the vast
      majority of traffic packets. On the other hand, each Relay must handle
      all traffic packets forwarded between its customer EUNs and the non-IRON
      Internet. The scaling concerns for this latter class of traffic are no
      different than for ASBR routers that connect large enterprise networks
      to the Internet. In terms of traffic scaling for Servers, each Server
      services a set of the VSP overlay network's customer EUNs. The Server
      services all traffic packets destined to its EUNs but only services the
      initial packets of flows initiated from the EUNs and destined to EPAs.
      Therefore, traffic scaling for EPA-addressed traffic is an asymmetric
      consideration and is proportional to the number of EUNs each Server
      serves.</t>

      <t>In terms of state requirements for Relays, each Relay maintains a
      list of all Servers in the VSP overlay network as well as FIB entries
      for all customer EUNs that each Server serves. This state is therefore
      dominated by the number of EUNs in the VSP overlay network. Sizing the
      Relay to accommodate state information for all EUNs is therefore
      required during VSP overlay network planning. In terms of state
      requirements for Servers, each Server maintains tunnel-neighbor state
      for each of the customer EUNs it serves, but it need not keep state for
      all EUNs in the VSP overlay network. Finally, neither Relays nor Servers
      need keep state for final destinations of outbound traffic.</t>

      <t>Clients source and sink all traffic packets originating from or
      destined to the customer EUN. Therefore, traffic scaling considerations
      for Clients are the same as for any site border router. Clients also
      retain state for the Servers for final destinations of outbound traffic
      flows. This can be managed as soft state, since stale entries purged
      from the cache will be refreshed when new traffic packets are sent.</t>

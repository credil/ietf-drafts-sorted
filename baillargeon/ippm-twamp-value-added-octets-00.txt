INTERNET DRAFT          Value-Added TWAMP Octets        January 12, 2011


1  Introduction

   The notion of embedding a number of meaningful fields in the padding
   octets has been established as a viable methodology for carrying
   additional information within the TWAMP-Test protocol running between
   a Session-Sender and a Session-Reflector [RFC5357] [RFC6038]. 

   This memo defines an OPTIONAL set of value-added octets of
   information that are placed at the beginning of the Packet Padding
   field [RFC5357] or at the beginning of the Packet Padding (to be
   reflected) field [RFC6038] by the Session-Sender, and are reflected
   or returned by the Session-Reflector. The length of value-added
   octets varies in size between 6, 10 and 14 octets depending on the
   setting of the flag bits specified at the beginning of the value-
   added octets. The value-added octets MAY be used for demultiplexing
   packets to the correct test session, identifying packets belonging to
   a train of a test session and/or measuring the IP-layer available
   path capacity (APC), IP-layer tight link capacity (TLC) and UDP
   throughput on both the forward and reverse paths.

   This memo also defines the OPTIONAL behaviors of the Session-Sender
   and Session-Reflector to enable the demultiplexing of test packets to
   the correct test session and to enable the measurements of the IP-
   layer APC, IP-layer TLC and UDP throughput on both forward and
   reverse paths based on information provided in the TWAMP test packets
   including the value-added octets. 

   UDP throughput is defined in the Benchmarking Terminology for Network
   Interconnection Devices specification [RFC1242]. IP-Type-P APC and
   TLC are defined in the Defining Network Capacity specification
   [RFC5136] and Amendment 1 of the Quality of Service and Network
   Performance specification [Y1540A1]. The actual method to calculate
   the available path capacity, the tight link capacity or the UDP
   throughput from packet-level data performance data is not discussed
   in this memo. 

   The value-added padding octets MAY be used with any TWAMP modes
   including TWAMP Light [RFC5357]. This memo does not introduce any
   changes to the TWAMP-Control protocol.

   Measurement systems are not required to implement the value-added
   octets and related behaviors described in this memo to claim
   compliance with TWAMP [RFC5357].

1.1  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Purpose and scope

   The purpose of this memo is as follows: 

      o  Define a structure for embedding a sequence of value-added
         fields at the beginning of the Packet Padding field [RFC5037]
         or Packet Padding (to be reflected) field [RFC6038] in the
         TWAMP test packets and, 

      o  Define the Session-Sender and Session-Reflector behaviors to
         enable the demultiplexing of test packets to the correct test
         session and measurements of IP-layer APC, IP-layer TLC and UDP
         throughput on both the forward and reverse paths 


   The scope of the memo is limited to the specifications of the
   following functions:

      o  The definition of an OPTIONAL Session-Sender behavior

      o  The definition of an OPTIONAL Session-Reflector behavior

   The definition of the OPTIONAL Session-Sender behavior includes a
   description of the value-added fields to communicate version number,
   flag bits, sender discriminator, sequence number of the last packet
   in a train and desired inter-packet time interval (or per-packet
   waiting time) for the reverse path direction of transmission.

   The OPTIONAL packet padding octets are designed to retain backward
   compatibility with the original TWAMP test protocol [RFC5357]. 




3  Measurement Principles for Capacity and Throughput Metrics

   Most capacity estimation methods,e.g. [RRBNC][PDM][ENHJMMB][SBW] for
   available capacity and [RFC2544] for UDP throughput, need to send and
   receive packets in groups, called packet trains or simply trains.
   Each train is sent at a specific transmission rate in a given
   direction. These trains must be identified within each bi-directional

   test session stream.

   The first measurement principle is to send multiple trains within a
   test session stream from one IP node to another IP node in order to
   estimate the IP-layer available path capacity, IP-layer tight link
   capacity or UDP throughput in the forward direction. Each train
   consists of a group of test packets which are separated from each
   other by a packet interval, as shown in the picture below. 


         tt                      tt                      tt
   |<---------->|          |<---------->|          |<---------->|
   |            |          |            |          |            |
   +------------+          +------------+          +------------+     
   |  Packet 1  |          |  Packet 2  |          |  Packet 3  |
   +------------+          +------------+          +------------+
   |                       |                       |
   |<--------------------->|<--------------------->|
       packet interval 1       packet interval 2




   The packet interval between consecutive packets for each train sent
   by the Session-Sender and reflected by the Session-Reflector MUST be
   calculated and determined by the controller or an application or
   entity communicating with the controller. The packet interval MAY be
   constant within a train. Determination of the packet interval within
   a train as well as for consecutive trains for a given test session is
   implementation-specific. 

   The transmission time tt to send one packet (i.e. determined by the
   interface speed and the IP packet size) is also shown in the picture.
   Observe that the packet interval MUST be larger than or equal to tt. 

   At the Session-Reflector, each received test packet within a forward
   train is time stamped. This provides a second set of packet interval
   values. Methods for measuring IP-layer available path capacity, IP-
   layer tight link capacity and UDP throughput use the packet intervals
   obtained from both end points in the estimation process. The method
   to measuring the UDP throughput may also require the packet loss at
   the receiving end. The estimation process itself as well as any
   requirements on software or hardware is implementation-specific.

   The second measurement principle is referred to as self-induced
   congestion. According to this principle, in order to measure the
   available path capacity, tight link capacity and UDP throughput, some
   trains MUST cause momentary congestion on the network path. In
 


Baillargeon, et al.      Expires July 16, 2011                  [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT          Value-Added TWAMP Octets        January 12, 2011


   essence this means that some trains MUST be sent at a higher rate
   than what is available on the network path. The congestion is only
   transient, for the duration of the train which is typically short. 

   In order to fulfill the above measurement principles and to measure
   the IP-layer available path capacity, IP-layer tight link capacity
   and UDP throughput in the reverse direction, the reflected test
   packets MUST be re-grouped into trains at the Session-Reflector. 

4  Principles for Test packet Demultiplexing

   The controller (or the Session-Sender) requires a method for
   demultiplexing the received test packets to the correct test session
   especially when it manages multiple active test sessions. The
   responder also requires a method for demultiplexing the received test
   packets from multiple active test sessions originating from the same
   controller or from different controllers. 

   The purpose of this section is to provide some basic principles for
   identifying the test packets and to clarify the optional usage of the
   Sender Discriminator (SD) field described in this memo. It is
   important to note the actual method for identifying a test packet and
   the process for mapping it to the correct test session are
   implementation-specific. They may differ between various controllers
   and responders. 

   In general, the methods are based on fields available in the various
   headers of the TWAMP test packet (e.g. Ethernet, IP, UDP and TWAMP
   headers). Note the SID [RFC4656] is generally not used for
   identification purpose since it does not normally appear in the TWAMP
   test packets. As an example, a management system (controller or
   responder) may use the source IP address of the incoming test packet
   in order to associate it to the correct test session. This method is
   valid but has a number of limitations. It is simple and effective
   when each measurement system only requires a single test session for
   each peer but fails when multiple test sessions (with different
   characteristics) are running between the same pair of controller and
   responder.

   Another approach is to use a combination of the source IP address and
   source (or destination) UDP port. This method is also valid but to
   work effectively, it requires that the controller allocates multiple
   UDP ports (one for each test session for instance) and/or the
   responder listens on multiple ports. Ideally, a measurement system
   should limit the number of UDP ports for sending and receiving test
   packets. This approach may be improved by using a combination of the
   source IP address, source UDP port and DSCP codepoint. This method
   also has its limitations. For instance, it cannot identify test

INTERNET DRAFT          Value-Added TWAMP Octets        January 12, 2011


   packets from different test sessions running between the same pair of
   controller and responder if they are using the same UDP endpoints and
   the same DSCP codepoint.

   This memo introduces a new field, the Sender Discriminator (SD) field
   intended to simplify the identification of the test packets at the
   controller and responder. It is especially useful when multiple test
   sessions are expected to be running between the same pair of
   controller and responder. As described in 6.1.2, the SD is a number
   generated by the Session-Sender that uniquely identifies a test
   session on its system. With this field, the controller may explicitly
   identify the test packets belonging to a test session. The responder
   may also use the SD field in combination of the source IP address for
   instance to identify the test packets belonging to a test session.


5  TWAMP Control Considerations

   This memo does not introduce any changes to the TWAMP-Control
   protocol. The value-added padding octets are intended to work with
   any TWAMP modes including TWAMP Light test sessions [RFC5357] running
   without the TWAMP-control protocol. 

   Both the Reflect Octets mode and Symmetrical Size mode SHOULD be
   selected to ensure the reflection of the value-added padding octets
   by the Session-Reflector and symmetrical size TWAMP-Test packets in
   the forward and reverse directions of transmission.

   The forward and reverse APC, TLC and UDP throughput measurement
   characteristics depend on the size of the test packets. All test
   packets (forward and reverse test packets) belonging to a specific
   test session responsible to measure the available path capacity,
   tight link capacity and/or UDP throughput MUST have the same IP
   packet size.  

5.1  Padding Length

   The length of the value-added octets is as follows:

      o  6 octets when the Session-Sender supports the packet to session
         identification process based on a discriminator value (S flag
         bit is set 1, L flag bit set to 0 and D flag bit is set to 0,

      o  6 octets when the Session-Sender supports the packet train
         identification process based on a sequence number (S flag bit
         is set to 0, L flag bit set to 1 and D flag bit is set to 0),

      o  10 octets when the Session-Sender supports the packet to

INTERNET DRAFT          Value-Added TWAMP Octets        January 12, 2011


         session identification process and the packet train
         identification process (S flag bit is set to 1, L flag bit set
         to 1 and D flag bit is set to 0),

      o  10 octets when the Session-Sender supports the packet train
         identification process and the APC measurements (S flag bit is
         set to 0, L flag bit set to 1 and D flag bit is set to 1),

      o  14 octets when the Session-Sender supports the packet to
         session identification process, the packet train identification
         process and the APC/TLC measurements (S, D and L flag bits are
         set to 1).

         when specifying a test session using the Reflect Octets mode
         with a non-zero value in the Server octets field.


5.3  Additional Considerations

   The desired behavior at the Session-Reflector MAY be negotiated via
   the TWAMP-Control protocol in the future. This is outside the scope
   of this specification. 

6  Extended TWAMP Test

   The TWAMP-test protocol carrying the value-added padding octets is
   identical to TWAMP [RFC5357] except for the definition of first 6, 10
   or 14 octets in the Padding Octet field that the Session-Sender
   expects to be reflected. 

   The Session-Sender and Session-Reflector behaviors are also modified.

6.1  Sender Behavior

   This section describes the extensions to the behavior of the TWAMP
   Session-Sender. 

   When a test session is configured for demultiplexing test packets to
   a test session based on a discriminator value, the Session-Sender
   MUST set the Sender Discriminator Present bit to 1 and MUST generate
   and transmit a unique nonzero discriminator value in the Sender
   Discriminator field.

   When a test session is configured for tagging the packets belonging a
   train of a test session based on a sequence number corresponding, the
   Session-Sender MUST set the Last Seqno in Train Present bit to 1 and
   MUST generate and transmit a valid sequence number in the Last Seqno
   in Train field.

   When a test session is configured for APC/TLC or UDP throughput
   measurements (including the packet train identification process), the
   Session-Sender MUST set the Last Seqno in Train Present bit to 1 and
   the Desired Reverse Packet Interval Present bit to 1, and MUST
   generate and transmit the appropriate values in the Last Seqno in
   Train and Desired Reverse Packet Interval fields. The Session-Sender
   MUST also group the test packets in trains and send the trains
   towards the Session-Reflector at the desired forward packet intervals
   provided by the available path capacity or throughput measurement
   method, tool or algorithm. The setting of Desired Reverse Rate
   Interval parameters is implementation specific for a given available
   path capacity or throughput measurement method. It is outside the

   scope of this specification.

   The Session-Sender MUST not use any of the value-added padding octets
   when a test session is not configured for tagging the test packets
   with a discriminator value or last sequence number in a train, or
   when the test session is not configured for APC/TLC or UDP throughput
   measurements.

6.1.1  Packet Timings

   The Send Schedule is not utilized in TWAMP and this is unchanged in
   this memo.

6.1.2  Session-Sender Packet Format and Content

   The Session-Sender packet format and content follow the same
   procedure and guidelines as defined in TWAMP [RFC5357] and TWAMP
   Reflect Octets and Symmetrical Size Features [RFC6038]. 

   This feature allows the Session-Sender to set the first few octets in
   the TWAMP-Test Packet Padding field with information that are
   considered useful for identifying test packets belonging to a test
   session or packet train, or with information deemed necessary for
   calculating the one-way APC, one-way TLC and/or one-way UDP
   throughput in each direction of transmission. 

   A version number and a sequence of flag bits are defined at the very
   beginning of the value-added padding octets. The version number
   identifies the version of the value-added padding octets and meaning
   of the flag bits. Each flag bit indicates if a specific field of a
   specific size is present in the valued-added padding octets. The flag
   bits are designed to accommodate different combinations of fields
   while reducing padding overhead when certain fields are not needed.
   The version number and flag bits also provide an effective method for
   parsing information at Session-Reflector and Session-Sender. This
   document defines version 1 with three flag bits: S, L and D. In the
   future, other flag bits may be defined to allow additional padding
   fields. This is outside the scope of this specification.

   The format of the test packet depends on the TWAMP mode and flag bits
   being used.

   the version number of the value-added padding octets and meaning of
   the flag bits. This document defines version 1.

   The Sender Discriminator Present bit (S) MUST be the first flag. If
   the Sender Discriminator Present bit is set to 1, then a Sender
   Discriminator field MUST be present and MUST contain valid
   information.

   The Last Seqno in Train Present bit (L) MUST be the second flag. If
   the Last Seqno in Train Present bit is set to 1, then the Last Seqno
   in Train field MUST be present and MUST contain valid information.

   The Desired Reverse Packet Interval Present bit (D) MUST be the third
   flag. If the Desired Reverse Packet Interval Present bit is set to 1,
   then Desired Reverse Packet Interval Present field MUST be present
   and MUST contain valid information.

   The Reserved field is reserved for future use. All 9 bits of the
   Reserved field MUST be transmitted as zero by the Session-Sender.

   The Sender Discriminator (SD) field MUST contain an unsigned 32 bit
   integer generated by the Session-Sender. It is used by the Session-
   Reflector and/or Session-Sender to identify packets belonging to a
   test session. The Session-Sender MUST choose a nonzero discriminator
   value that is unique among all test sessions on its system. This
   field is present only if the Sender Discriminator Present bit is set
   to one.

   The Last Seqno in Train MUST contain an unsigned 32 bit integer
   generated by the Session-Sender. It MUST indicate the expected
   sequence number of the last packet in the train.  It SHOULD be used
   by the Session-Sender and Session-reflector to identify the train a
   test packet belongs to. The packets belonging to a train are
   determined by observing the test packet sequence number in relation
   to the Last Seqno for a train. The sequence number of a packet in a
   train MUST be lower than or equal to the Last Seqno for that train.
   The sequence number MUST also be larger than the Last Seqno for the
   previous train. This field is present only if the Last Seqno in Train
   Present bit is set to one.

   The Desired Reverse Packet Interval (DRPI) MUST contain an unsigned
   32 bit integer generated by the Session-Sender. It MUST indicate the
   desired inter-packet time interval (or the waiting time) that the
   Session-Reflector SHOULD use when transmitting the reflected test
   packets towards the Session-Sender. The format of this field MUST be
   a fractional part of a second as defined in OWAMP [RFC4656]. This
   field is present only if the Desired Reverse Packet Interval Present
   bit is set to one.

   The method by which the Sender Discriminator and Desired Reverse
   Packet Interval values are obtained is outside of the scope of this
   document.



6.2  Reflector behavior

   The TWAMP Session-Reflector follows the procedures and guidelines in
   Section 4.2 of [RFC5357], with some changes and additional functions.

   When the Session-Reflector is configured for packet to session
   identification based on a sender discriminator value:

      o  The Session-Reflector MUST read the Version field and the S
         flag as test packets are received. 

      o  If the Version field and the S flag bit are both equal to 1,
         the Session-Reflector MUST continue reading and extracting the
         information from the Sender Discriminator field in the value-
         added padding octets. 

      o  After reading and extracting the information from the Sender
         Discriminator field, the Session-Reflector MUST associate the
         test packets to the correct test session based on the value
         specified in the Sender Discriminator field and the source IP
         address specified in the IP header of the test packet. The
         actual method for demultiplexing the received test packets to
         the correct test session based on the Sender Discriminator and
         source IP address is outside the scope of this specification.
         The Session-Reflector MAY also use additional packet fields to
         demultiplex test packets to a test session.

      o  If the Version field or the S flag bit is not equal to 1, the
         Session-Reflector SHOULD ignore the Sender Discriminator field
         and SHOULD follow the procedures and guidelines described in
         section 4.2 of [RFC5357]. 



   When the Session-Reflector is configured for APC/TLC or UDP
   throughput measurements (including the packet train identification
   process):

      o  The Session-Reflector MUST read the Version field, the L flag
         and the D flag as test packets are received. 

      o  If the Version field, the L flag bit and the D flag bit are

INTERNET DRAFT          Value-Added TWAMP Octets        January 12, 2011


         equal to 1, the Session-Reflector MUST continue reading and
         extracting the information from the Last Seqno in Train and
         Desired Reverse Packet Interval fields in the value-added
         padding octets. 

      o  After reading and extracting the information from the Last
         Seqno in Train and Desired Reverse Packet Interval fields, the
         Session-Reflector MUST buffer the packets belonging to the
         current train (or store the packet-level performance data).
         When all packets belonging to the current train have been
         received, the Session-Reflector SHOULD transmit them in a new
         train with a waiting time (packet interval) for each packet
         indicated in the Desired Reverse Packet Interval field. If the
         Desired Reverse Packet Interval field is set to zero, then the
         Session-Reflector SHOULD transmit the packet as immediately as
         possible. The Session-Reflector MUST not reorder the test
         packets if they happen to arrive out-of-sequence. 

      o  For each incoming packet within a train of a test session
         stream, the Last Seqno in Train MUST be compared to Sequence
         number in the same packet in order to determine when a complete
         train has been collected. A train SHOULD be transmitted as
         immediately as possible after the last packet of the train has
         been received. The last packet within a train has Sender
         Sequence Number = Last Seqno in Train.

      o  The Last Seqno in Train of a packet MUST also be compared to
         the Last Seqno in Train of the previous packet in order to
         determine if a new train needs to be collected. In case of
         packet loss, the Session-Reflector MUST transmit the incomplete
         train when it receives a packet with a Last SeqNo in Train
         belonging to the another train (e.g. next train) of the test
         session, or after a timeout. The timeout MAY be the REFWAIT
         timer specified in section 4.2 of [RFC5357].

      o  Packets arriving out-of-order within a train MUST be buffered
         at the Session-Reflector if the train is not yet transmitted to
         the Session-Sender. If the train is already transmitted, the
         test packet SHOULD be returned to the Session-Sender as quickly
         as possible.

      o  If the Version field, the L flag or D flag is not equal to 1,
         the Session-Reflector SHOULD ignore the Last Seqno in Train and
         Desired Reverse Packet Interval fields fields, SHOULD follow
         the procedures and guidelines described in section 4.2 of
         [RFC5357] and SHOULD transmit the packet as immediately as
         possible including the test packets that are currently stored
         for the test session.

INTERNET DRAFT          Value-Added TWAMP Octets        January 12, 2011


   The Session-Reflector MUST implement the changes described above when
   the Session-Reflector supports the APC/TLC/UDP throughput
   measurements (including the packet train identification process) and
   the packet to session identification process.

   The Session-Reflector MUST ignore the value-added octets and MUST
   follow the procedures and guidelines described in section 4.2 of
   [RFC5357] when the Session-Reflector does not support APC/TLC/UDP
   throughput measurements or the packet to session identification
   process.



6.2.1  Session-Reflector Packet Format and Content

   The Session-Reflector packet format and content follow the same
   procedure and guidelines as defined in TWAMP [RFC5357] and TWAMP
   Reflect Octets and Symmetrical Size Features [RFC6038], with the
   following changes:

      o  The Session-Reflector MUST re-use (reflect) the value-added
         padding octets (6, 10 or 14 octets) provided in the Sender's
         Packet Padding.

      o  The Session-Reflector MAY re-use the rest of the padding octets
         in the Sender's Packet Padding.

   When using the recommended truncation process [RFC5357], the Session-
   Reflector MUST truncate exactly 27 octets of padding in
   Unauthenticated mode,and exactly 56 octets in Authenticated and
   Encrypted modes.


6.3  Additional Considerations

   It is not required to use the Sender Discriminator field for
   calculating the one-way APC, one-way TLC and/or one-way UDP
   throughput. The Sender Discriminator Present bit can be set to zero.
   However, the Session-Sender and Session-Reflector MUST implement a
   local policy to identify the test packets belonging to a specific
   test session. The method for demultiplexing the received test packets
   to the correct test session based on other packet fields (e.g. fields
   in the IP header) is outside the scope of this specification.

   APC/TLC/UDP throughput measurements introduce an additional
   consideration when the test sessions operate in TWAMP Light. When the
   Session-Reflector does not have knowledge of the session state, the
   measurement system will only be capable to estimate or calculate the

INTERNET DRAFT          Value-Added TWAMP Octets        January 12, 2011


   available path capacity, tight link capacity and UDP throughput in
   the forward path direction of transmission. APC/TLC/UDP Throughput
   measurements in the reverse path direction requires the Session-
   Reflector to have knowledge of the session state and be capable to
   identify the test packets belonging to a specific test session. The
   method for creating a session state from the initial test packets on
   the TWAMP Light Session-Reflector is outside the scope of this
   specification.


7  Security Considerations

   The value-added octets do not appear to permit any new attacks on
   hosts communicating with core TWAMP [RFC5357].

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well. See [RFC4656] and [RFC5357].


8  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

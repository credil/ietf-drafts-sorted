                IPv6 RA Option for DS-Lite AFTR Element
                      draft-lee-6man-ra-dslite-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a new optional extension to IPv6 Router
   Advertisement messages to allow IPv6 routers to advertise DS-Lite
   AFTR addresses to IPv6 hosts (i.e., a default IPv6 route for DS-Lite
   traffic).  The provisioning of the AFTR address is crucial to access
   IPv4 connectivity services in a DS-Lite context.  Means to ensure
   reliable delivery of this information to connecting hosts is a must.

   Furthermore, this RA option can be used as a means to distribute DS-
   Lite serviced customers among a set of deployed AFTRs without
   requiring a central knowledge of the underlying topology and deployed
   AFTRs.

Internet-Draft             RA for AFTR Element              October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] provides a means
   to guarantee IPv4 service continuity during the transition period
   where global IPv4 addresses become a scarce resource.  In the DS-Lite
   framework, the B4 element tunnels the IPv4-in-IPv6 datagrams towards
   one of the available AFTR entities deployed in the provider network.
   The B4 element can learn the AFTR address by DHCPv6
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option] or RADIUS
   [I-D.maglione-softwire-dslite-radius-ext].

   The provisioning of the AFTR information to connecting hosts
   embedding B4 is mandatory for the delivery of IPv4 connectivity
   services in the context of DS-Lite deployment.  As an analogy with
   native IPv6 connectivity provisioning, the AFTR information (i.e., IP
   address or FQDN) can be seen as a default IPv6 route for DS-Lite
   IPv4-in-IPv6 traffic.  Indeed, when no AFTR information is
   provisioned to a requesting host embedding a B4 element, no external
   IPv4 address would be assigned and the IPv4 traffic won't be
   delivered outside the local domain.  In other terms, fail to
   provision an AFTR to B4 element will break IPv4 connectivity.

   Service providers need a reliable and flexible method to provision
   the AFTR address(es) to the B4 elements in customers' premises.  This
   document describes a mechanism to use a new IPv6 RA Option to
   advertise the AFTR address to the IPv6 hosts.

   In the remaining part of the document, host is used for short to
   denote a host embedding B4 element.


2.  Motivation

   A service provider may want to deploy DS-lite without using DHCP.
   Auto-configuration [RFC4861] allows an IPv6 host to learn the IPv6
   prefix and IPv6 default gateway solely from the Router Advertisement
   (RA).  In this document, we define a new AFTR RA option so that a B4
   element can learn a set of AFTRs.


3.  Coexistence of RA Option and DHCPv6 Option

   The RA AFTR option and the DHCP option can be used together.  When
   the host receives a RA and the "O" flag is set in the RA, the host
   may send a DHCPv6 request for AFTR provisioning.  If the DHCP server
   returns the DS-Lite tunnel option, the host may use the address in
   the option.  If the RA does not contain the AFTR option, the RA may
   send the DHCP request to obtain the AFTR configuration from the DHCP

   server regardless of whether the "O" flag is set in the RA or not.


4.  Terminology

   This document uses terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].  In addition, we define the
   following new terms:

   o  AFTR Option: IPv6 RA option to deliver AFTR information (e.g., IP
      address) to IPv6 hosts.

   o  AFTR Element List: A data structure for managing AFTR Element
      Information in the IPv6 protocol stack in addition to the Neighbor
      Cache and Destination Cache for Neighbor Discovery.


5.  Overview

   This document defines a new ND option called AFTR option that
   contains the list of addresses of AFTR element.  This new option
   advertises a list of available AFTR elements.  This option follows
   the procedures defined in [RFC4861].  This works the same way that
   the hosts learn routers and prefixes.  The AFTR element is only
   useful for B4 elements, i.e.- ordinary IPv6 hosts must ignore this
   option.  The IPv6 host with B4 element implemented can learn a list
   of AFTR elements thanks to this option.

   The AFTR option can be sent along with other options in the same RA
   message simultaneously.  The router sending the AFTR option in RA
   must be configured with the AFTR information.  The information is
   provisioned in the first-hop router of the B4 elements.  The AFTR
   option can be used on any network that supports ND.


6.  Neighbour Discovery Extension

   This AFTR configuration mechanism in this memo defines a new ND
   option in Neighbor Discovery: The AFTR Element option.

6.1.  AFTR Element Option

   The AFTR Element Option contains one or more IPv6 addresses of the
   AFTR elements.  All of the addresses share the same lifetime value.
   If a particular AFTR is configured to have different lifetime values,
   a new AFTR option can be used.  Figure 1 shows the AFTR Element
   Option format.

   o  Lifetime is a 16-bit unsigned integer.  The lifetime associated

   o  Addresses of IPv6 AFTR Elements contain one or more 128-bit IPv6
      addresses of the AFTR elements.  The number of addresses is
      determined by the Length field.  That is, the number if addresses
      is equal to (Length - 1) / 2.

6.1.1.  Procedure in IPv6 Host with B4 Implementation

   When the host receives the option via RA, it checks whether the
   option is valid.

   o  If the AFTR option is valid, the host should copy the option's
      value into the B4 configuration.

   o  If the AFTR option is invalid, the host must discard the option.

Appendix A.  Load Balancing Use Case

   [[Note: The content of this section is still under discussion between
   authors.]]

   Load balancing and traffic dimensioning is one of the hot topic to be
   considered when deploying stateful devices such as AFTRs.  Service
   providers need means to distribute their DS-Lite serviced customers
   among a set of AFTR devices without experiencing any congestion
   neither traffic loss due to the overloading of a given AFTR while
   free AFTR resources are available.  This dimensioning task is not new
   per se.  In particular, VoIP service providers rely on DNS to
   redirect customers traffic to a given SBC (or P-CSCF) node.

   Various solutions to balance customers among a set of AFTRs can be
   considered as follows:

   o  DHCPv6 server returns an IPv6 address of an AFTR based on a
      identifier of the customer.

   o  DHCPv6 server returns a generic FQDN of AFTR nodes.  A DNS-based
      load balancing is implemented during the resolution of the FQDN.

   o  DHCPv6 returns a geographical domain search name which will be
      used to redirect the client to a given AFTR.  The DHCPv6 server
      needs to correlate the AFTR information with an identifier of the
      requesting customer.

   o  The DHCPv6 relay agent can insert locally configured information
      when responding back to a connecting client.

   o  Etc.

   As an alternative to these modes, RA can be used to implicitly
   redirect DS-Lite serviced customers to a given AFTR without requiring
   any use of a customer identifier.  DHCPv6 servers are not modified.

   Access routers can be configured to insert an IP address when sending
   RAs to attached hosts.  The configuration of the information to be
   inserted in RA messages can be achieved using already deployed tools.

Appendix B.  Scope

   It was tempting to define a generic option which is an extension of
   [RFC4191] to indicate a route which is used by IPv4-in-IPv6 traffic.
   Since DS-Lite is the only technique which is required crossing a
   stateful device after the de-capsulation.  We decided to limit the
   applicability scope of this option to DS-Lite.

Abstract

   This document describes the general problem of network stratum query
   for application optimization. Network Stratum query is an ability to
   query the network from an application controller such as those used
   in Data Centers so that application controller decisions such as
   server assignment or virtual machine instantiation/migration could be
   performed with better knowledge of the underlying network conditions.

   As application servers are distributed geographically across Data
   Centers, many application-related decisions such as which server to
   assign a new client or where to instantiate/migrate virtual machines
   will suffer from sub-optimality unless the underlying network
   conditions are factored in the decision process. The lack of network
   awareness may result in not meeting the end-user service objective
   for some key applications like video gaming/conferencing that require
   stringent latency and bandwidth requirement.

1. Introduction

   Cross Stratum Optimization is a joint optimization effort in
   allocating resources to end-users that involves both the Application
   Stratum and Network Stratum.

   The application stratum is the functional block which manages and
   controls application resources and provides application resources to
   a variety of clients/end-users. Application resources are non-network

   resources critical to achieving the application service
   functionality. Examples include: application specific servers,
   storage, content, large data sets, and computing power. Data Centers
   are regarded as tangible realization of the application stratum
   architecture.

   The network stratum is the functional block which manages and
   controls network resources and provides transport of data between
   clients/end-users to and among application resources. Network
   Resources are resources of any layer 3 or below (L1/L2/L3) such as
   bandwidth, links, paths, path processing (creation, deletion, and
   management), network databases, path computation, admission control,
   and resource reservation capability.

   Application services offered by Data Centers by their very nature
   utilize application resources (e.g., servers, storage, memory,
   etc...) in Data Centers, and the underlying network resources
   provided by LANs, MANs, and carrier's transport networks.

   As the application servers are distributed geographically across many
   Data Centers, decisions such as server assignment or new virtual
   machine instantiation/migration will suffer from sub-optimality
   unless the underlying network conditions are factored in the decision
   process. The lack of network awareness may result in not meeting the
   end-user service objective for some key applications like video
   gaming/conferencing that require stringent latency and bandwidth
   requirement.

   This document describes the general problem of network stratum query
   (NS Query) in Data Center environments. Network Stratum query is an
   ability to query the network from application controller in Data
   Centers so that application server assignment or virtual machine
   instantiation/migration decision would be jointly performed based on
   both the application resource/load status and the network
   resource/load status.

   The NS query is different from typical "horizontal" query
   capabilities in the network. The horizontal query in the network is
   carried by the head end (i.e., data source) that would "probe" the
   network to test the capabilities for data flows to/from particular
   point in the network. This is a horizontal scheme.

   NS Query is a two-stage query that consists of two stages:

     . A vertical query capability where an external point (i.e., the
        Application Control Gateway (ACG) in Data Center) will query
        the network (i.e., the Network Control Gateway (NCG)); and

     . A horizontal query capability where the NCG to gather the
        collective information of a variety of horizontal schemes
        (IPPM, IGP, RIB, etc.) implemented in the network stratum.

   NS Query does not re-invent the wheel on existing network
   capabilities but tries to reuse them where possible.

2. Network Contexts

   Figure 1 shows a typical data center architecture where an end-user
   (the point of consuming resource) needs to be connected for its
   application (e.g., gaming) to a server located in one of the data
   centers geographically spread.

   Figure 1 shows that the user application can be served by any of the
   servers in DC1, DC2 or DC3. When the initial request arrives to the
   proxy server in DC1, the proxy server (aka, the load balancer) would
   ideally assign an "optimal" server based on both server resource/load
   status and the network resources/load status. This server assignment
   decision today, however, is limited due to the lack of network
   awareness in this decision making process in the application.

   For example, the server close to the user in Data Center 1 may find a
   good server that can serve the application. Assume that this
   particular application requires x amount of minimum bandwidth
   guarantee and with less than y ms of latency limit. The route that
   serves Data Center 1 traffic to the end-user (PE1 - PE4) may not have
   enough capacity at a moment of service instantiation and therefore
   the service objective of the end-user may not be satisfied had such
   route been taken.

   On the other hand, there may be good servers available in Data
   Centers 2 and 3 and their routes (PE2-PE4 and PE3-PE4) may have
   enough capacity to meet the service requirement.

   This example illustrates the benefit of and the need for the joint
   optimization across the application and network strata. NS Query is
   the ability to query the network from an application to collect a
   certain level of network information. No such mechanisms exist in the
   today's Internet Protocol technologies.

   Figure 2 shows the context of NS Query in a more detail within the
   overarching data center architecture shown in Figure 1.

                     Figure 2. NS Query Architecture

   Figure 2 shows key architectural components that enable NS Query
   capability. The Application Control Gateway (ACG) is the proxy
   gateway that interfaces with network and generate queries to network.
   The ACG can query various metric values that may contribute to
   meeting the overall service objective of an application. This is a
   vertical query (Stage 1).

   In the network stratum, the Network Control Gateway (NCG) serves as
   the proxy gateway to the network. The NCG receives the query request
   from the ACG, probes the network to test the capabilities for data
   flow to/from particular point in the network, and gather the
   collective information of a variety of horizontal schemes (IPPM,
   IGP, MIB, TED, etc.) implemented in the network stratum. This is a
   horizontal query (Stage 2).

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query               April 2011


   Further, the NCG provides the responses to the original query sent
   from the ACG. The data collected by the NCG needs to be abstracted.
   This abstraction is needed on two grounds.

   First, the network does not usually reveal its details to the
   outside entity. Although the Data Center providers and the carriers
   are business partners in providing application services to the end-
   users and to the application providers (e.g., gaming providers),
   detail network data may not be leaked to the Data Centers, and vice
   versa.

   Secondly, detail network data may not be understood by the
   application. Link or node level data in and of themselves may not
   help the application to process the detail data. For instance,
   latency or bandwidth on a link level is too detail for application
   to handle. Instead, latency or bandwidth on a route level (i.e., PE1
   - PE4 in Figure 1) will help the application make its server
   selection/instantiation decision.

   The abstraction function needs to be provided by the NCG. Note that
   NCG plays a head end role within the network probing/collecting
   network performance/management data (e.g., IPPM, MIB, etc.) or
   routing data [MRT] (e.g., LSDB, TED, BGP-RIB, etc.) and others. Once
   the basic data is collected, the NCG will need to abstract/summary
   before it sends to the application.



3. Problem Statement

         3.1. Limitation of existing probing schemes

   The current state-of-the art probing schemes from an external point
   are based on ping or trace route like mechanisms based on the
   assumption that the underlying transport network is L3 network and
   that the routing is simple IP forwarding.

   In reality, the carrier's routing schemes are likely to include IP
   tunneling or MPLS tunneling on top of or in place of IP forwarding.
   In some cases, the actual network may be VPN, MPLS-TE or GMPLS-TE
   networks where trace route does not work.

   This implies that network status estimation technique made from
   application stratum cannot be accurate. Thus, application resource
   allocation to end-users can suffer sub-optimality and fail to meet
   performance objective for the application.

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query               April 2011


         3.2. Lack of vertical query schemes

   Currently, the query in the network is carried by the head end (i.e.,
   data source) that would "probe" the network to test the capabilities
   for data flows to/from particular point in the network. This is a
   horizontal scheme.

   There is no standard "vertical" query scheme that allows an
   application control gateway in Data Center to query network stratum
   in a way suitable for a third party (i.e. an entity "outside" the
   network).

   Due to the lack of standard vertical query scheme, there is a
   limitation on exchanging information between application and network
   that would increase efficiency of joint optimization across
   application to network. For instance, the ability to exchange the
   application profile information (defined in Section 4.1) or network
   capability information between application and network would increase
   efficiency of resource allocation across application to network.

         3.3. Limitation of SNMP MIB network monitoring techniques

   SNMP MIB monitoring techniques as defined in [RFC2261] and [RFC2265]
   do not provide mechanisms to guarantee synchronization of the data
   collection. This higher level of synchronization is necessary to
   service: a) application with stringent QoS and Bandwidth, or to b)
   better schedule massive quantities of small data flows.

   In addition, SNMP MIB Network Monitoring lacks a whole network query
   capability. A whole network query is a query to gather information
   across many boxes simultaneously under the control of a single
   administration domain (AD) as defined in RFC 1136. A single AD means
   the single AS or multiple ASes under the control of a single AD.

         3.4. Lack of abstraction mechanisms

   Most of the information needed to provide NS Query is currently
   available from the network; however, it is not aggregated into a form
   suitable for use by the application stratum. For example from
   commonly monitored SNMP based link statistics and current routing
   tables one can easily compute average available bandwidth and many
   other statistical performance measures such as packet loss, latency,
   etc.

   However, neither the raw SNMP nor routing table data should be
   delivered to the application stratum since (a) this reveals too much
   information concerning the carriers network, (b) presents too much
   information to transfer to each application. This warrants some works

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query               April 2011


   on abstraction from network side to preserve the privacy of network
   stratum details from the application stratum.



4. High-level requirements

   This section discusses high-level requirements to support NS Query in
   the Data Center environments.

   The ACG plays the key role functioning as an application gateway to
   network and runs the NS Query. The ACG has access to the end-user
   profile for the application and the candidate servers' locations
   locally and remotely located. How the ACG access these information is
   beyond the scope of this work.

         4.1. Application Profile

   The application Stratum needs to provide the application profile to
   network.

   Example service profile information that can be useful to network to
   understand is as follows:

      . End user IP address;

      . User access router IP address;

      . Authentication Profile: Authentication Key;

      . Bandwidth Profile: Minimum bandwidth required for the
        application;

      . Connectivity Profile: P-P, P-MP, Anycast (Multi-destination);

      . Directionality of the connectivity: unidirectional, bi-
        directional;

      . Path Estimation Objective Function: Min latency, etc.

   Additional profile information can be added depending on the network
   capability.

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query               April 2011


         4.2. Network Load Data to be queried (First Satge)

   For a given location mapping information (i.e., from the server
   location to end-user location), the query from an application can ask
   the following network load data:

     . Type of networks and the technical capabilities of the networks;
     . Bandwidth capabilities and availability;
     . latency;
     . jitter;
     . packet loss;
     . And other Network Performance Objective (NPO) as defined in
        section 5 of [ITU-T Y.1541].


   Note that this can be asked in a different way. For example, the
   query can simply ask:

     . Can you give me a route with x amount of b/w (from server to
       end-user) within y ms of latency?
     . Can you give me a route with x amount of b/w (from server to
       end-user) with no packet loss?


         4.3. A Whole Network Query capability (Second Stage)

   Upon the request from application (specifically, the ACG in Figure
   2), the network (specifically the NCG in Figure 2) should perform "a
   whole network query" of information.

   A whole network query is a query to gather information across many
   boxes simultaneously under the control of a single administration
   domain (AD) as defined in RFC 1136. A single AD means the single AS
   or multiple ASes under the control of a single AD.

   The scope of a whole network query can include the topology of the
   network, the bandwidth availability for the routes of interest, the
   capabilities and congestion of links and routes, and an indication of
   the contribution to delay and jitter that each link and route will
   contribute and so on.

         4.4. Data Synchronization Mechanism

   The ability to capture the data at the same instant should be
   provided.

         4.5. Responses to NS Query from network to application

   Given the network query from application, the network should provide
   the following mechanisms:


  - For a given location mapping information from application (i.e.,
     from the server location to end-user location) and the gathered
     information by the second stage query discussed in section 4.3.,
     the network needs to present the requested information in a
     standard format and respond to the application.

   The actual abstraction mechanism is beyond the scope of this
   document.

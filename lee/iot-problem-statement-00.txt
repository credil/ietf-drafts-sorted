      The Internet of Things - Concept and Problem Statement   April 2011 
                                                                       
                                    
    

1. Introduction 

   The Internet of Things (IoT) [1-3] is a novel paradigm that is 
   becoming popular with research and industries. The basic idea is that 
   IoT will connect objects around us (electronic, electrical, non 
   electrical) to provide seamless communication and contextual services 
   provided by them. Development of RFID tags, sensors, actuators, 
   mobile phones make it possible to materialize IoT which interact and 
   co-operate each other to make the service better and accessible 
   anytime, from anywhere.   
   There are so many applications that are possible because of IoT. For 
   individual users, IoT brings useful applications like home automation, 
   security, automated devices monitoring, and management of daily tasks. 
   For professionals, automated applications provide useful contextual 
   information all the time to help on their works and decision making. 
   Industries, with sensors and actuators operations can be rapid, 
   efficient and more economic. Managers who need to keep eye on many 
   things can automate tasks connection digital and physical objects 
   together. Every sectors energy, computing, management, security, 
   transportation are going to be benefitted with this new paradigm.  
   Development of several technologies made it possible to achieve the 
   vision of Internet of things. Identification technology such as RFID 
   allows each object to represent uniquely by having unique identifier.  
   Identity reader can read any time the object allows real time 
   identification and tracking. Wireless sensor technology allows 
   objects to provide real time environmental condition and context. 
   Smart technologies allow objects to become more intelligent which can 
   think and communicate. Nanotechnologies are helping to reduce the 
   size of the chip incorporating more processing power and 
   communication capabilities in a very small chip. 
   This document explains the concept of the Internet of Things and 
   several characteristics of objects. In addition, this document 
   investigates key technical issues and specifies problems for the IoT. 
   The main objective of this document is to develop a new architectural 
   framework in order to solve problems.  

    

2. Concept of IoT 

2.1. Basic concept of the IoT 

   o Definition of the "IoT"

      The Internet of Things - Concept and Problem Statement   April 2011 
                                                                       
                                    
      Internet: The original "Internet" is based on the TCP/IP protocol 
      suite but any network based on the TCP/IP protocol suite cannot 
      belong to the Internet because private networks and 
      Telecommunication networks are not part of the Internet even 
      though they are based on the TCP/IP protocol suite. In the 
      viewpoint of IoT, the "Internet" considers the TCP/IP suite and 
      non-TCP/IP suite at the same time. 

       

   o Definition and scope of "things" 

      In the vision of IoT, "things" are very various such as computers, 
      sensors, people, actuators, refrigerators, TVs, vehicles, mobile 
      phones, clothes, food, medicines, books, etc. These things are 
      classified as three scopes: people, machine (for example, sensor, 
      actuator, etc) and information (for example clothes, food, 
      medicine, books and etc). These "things" should be identified at 
      least by one unique way of identification for the capability of 
      addressing and communicating with each other and verifying their 
      identities. In here, if the "thing" is identified, we call it the 
      "object." 

       

   o Terminologies 

   o Goals (new architecture/framework) and vision 

2.2. Classification and characteristics of objects 

   Many studies are going on regarding IoT which is going to be an 
   advanced network including normal physical objects together with 
   computers and other advanced electronic appliances. Instead of 
   forming ad hoc network, normal objects will be a part of whole 
   network so that they can collaborate, understand real time 
   environmental data and react accordingly in need. 

    

   Objects can be classified as follows. 

   o Size: small, normal 

   o Mobility: mobile, fixed 

   o Power: without power supply, with power supply

3. Features of the IoT 

3.1. Overall aspects  

   (Order(s) of magnitude bigger than the Internet, No computers or 
   humans at endpoint, Inherently mobile, disconnected, unattended) 

3.2. Applications/services aspects 

3.3. Networking aspects 

3.4. Link/physical layer aspects

4. General issues 

   o Scalability 

      The IoT has larger overall scope than communications with 
      conventional hosts. There will be small (home environment) or 
      large scale (factory, building) application area. Objects 
      communicate with each other and with people seamlessly. Each 
      constituent might be offering different services. Basic 
      functionalities such as communication, service discovery need to 
      be functioning efficiently in both small and large scale 
      environment. Scalability regarding addressing can be taken as an 
      example. IPv4 address is finishing, object-to-object communication 
      needs huge number of IP addresses in order to uniquely identify 
      each objects. As a scalable solution, IPv6 can be used which can 
      accommodate as many things as required to include in the IoT.  

   o Interoperability

      The Internet of Things - Concept and Problem Statement   April 2011 
                                                                       
                                    
      World of physical objects is extremely diverse. They have 
      different communication, information and processing capabilities. 
      Each object would also be subjected to very different conditions 
      such as power energy availability and communication bandwidth 
      requirement. In order to facilitate communication and cooperation 
      common practices and standards are required. Interoperability 
      issue includes device, services heterogeneities. Devices are small, 
      large, with continuously powered, without power supply. 
      Interoperability solution should be maintained to provide seamless 
      interaction among them. Service description, publishing, and 
      discovery mechanisms should be interoperable otherwise the IoT 
      will be converted into islands of heterogeneous object network.  

   o Discovery 

      In dynamic environment of ubiquitous networking, suitable services 
      for objects must be automatically identified. As users want to 
      know product information and their availability all the time, it 
      requires appropriate semantic means of describing their 
      functionality.  

   o Data volumes 

      Depending on application and use cases there is variance in data 
      volume. In a scenario where there is brief collaboration among 
      objects data volume will be less. However, in case where there are 
      large number of objects and interact among very frequently there 
      are large volume of data. How to handle big volume of data is one 
      of the important challenges of ubiquitous networking. Volume can 
      be considered either from device or as a whole network perspective. 
      Each object has augmented memory, storage and processing 
      capability. If there are a large number of peer objects 
      communicating with each other, object runs out of processing, 
      memory and storage. From network perspective it is also difficult 
      to handle bulk amount of data if objects produce huge bytes of 
      data regularly. Solution can be periodic communication between 
      objects or some data compression and optimization techniques.  

   o Power supply

      The Internet of Things - Concept and Problem Statement   April 2011 
                                                                       
                                    
      Scope of object is broad in the IoT. It ranges from small to large. 
      Moreover, things move around and difficult to connect to power 
      supply all the time. So they need to operate with self-sufficient 
      energy source. Passive RFID does not contain power supply, which 
      requires reader in order to get information from it. Not all 
      objects can be connected to continuous power supply also, 
      providing battery for each small object may not be feasible. 
      Therefore, energy efficient communication mechanisms are essential.  

   o Fault-tolerance 

      The IoT consists of objects have less power. They are more dynamic 
      and mobile compare to current state. However, users rely and 
      believe that network will function properly. To maintain robust 
      and trust worthy dynamic ubiquitous networking requires redundancy 
      in several levels and ability to automatically adapt to changed 
      conditions depending on the required quality of service.  

   o Security and personal privacy 

      Users are fighting with security and privacy issue of current 
      Internet in large extent. When it will be broaden in to ubiquitous 
      networking, there is even more threat of security and personal 
      privacy. Confidentiality, authenticity and trustworthiness of 
      communication partners need to be maintained. Users may want to 
      give things limited service access not allowing them to 
      communicate in uncontrolled manner. 

   o Device adaptation 

      Initially started with retail and logistic application, the IoT is 
      covering very general applications scenario integrating things to 
      the network. It allows objects to collaborate each other and with 
      person. There are heterogeneous devices, application scenarios, 
      data format, and communication network. Each connected objects 
      should be able to adapt the situation where it is now. When a 
      person with smart phone enters home, it should adapt communication 
      mechanism, addressing and localized environment. When it reaches 
      in office environment it should adapt with new situation where the 
      mechanisms available in home can be different. Adaption in many 
      senses should be maintained.  

   o Intelligence

      The Internet of Things - Concept and Problem Statement   April 2011 
                                                                       
                                    
      The smart objects should be able to intelligently co-operate with 
      the environment in which it will be introduced. Sensing current 
      environment, acting intelligently according to situation is 
      required in order to realize true object-to-object communication. 
      The IoT makes possible for virtually any object around us to 
      exchange information and work in synergy to increase quality of 
      our life. There are smart clothes which will interact 
      intelligently with climate control of car and home to select the 
      most suitable temperature and humidity for the person. Smart book 
      interacts with entertainment devices such as TV in order to 
      elaborate the topic we are reading. Most of the devices act 
      according to their predetermined set of actions or they will 
      collaborate with each other based on current context and act 
      accordingly. 

  

5. Problems 

5.1. Identifier for objects and services 

   There are various kinds of identifier with different identification 
   codes according to objects and their services. Current identification 
   schemes for objects are also different from their purposes. 

   Solution:   

   o Identification (new naming space, globally unique ID) 

      With the huge evolved communication objects, the hierarchical 
      identification schemes are required. The aggregation feature of 
      IPv6 address is one of example. 

      According to the classification of Things, the different 
      identification schemes are required. That is, the information such 
      as books, medicine and clothes may not require the global 
      identification because revocation lists are required. It means 
      some objects will be destroyed. 

    

5.2. Object naming  

   Current Internet just identifies the specific server which contents 
   are stored. As the end points of current Internet are hosts,

      The Internet of Things - Concept and Problem Statement   April 2011 
                                                                       
                                    
   Solution: 

   o Naming/addressing for fixed/mobile objects 

    

   Object naming services 

   The name service of Internet such as DNS (Domain Name System) 
   [RFC1034] has already been one of the most important infrastructures 
   of the Internet nowadays. For example, DNS is an indispensable system 
   of the Internet used for translating the "human-friendly" host names 
   of computers on a TCP/IP network into their corresponding "machine-
   friendly" IP addresses. In general, DNS also stores other types of 
   information, such as the list of mail servers that accept email for a 
   given Internet domain. By providing a worldwide, distributed name 
   service, DNS is an essential component of the functionality of the 
   Internet. 

   Similarly, object name service will also be one of essential and key 
   elements in the IoT, which can be used for translating the "thing-
   friendly" names of object which maybe belong to heterogeneous name 
   spaces (e.g. EPC, uCode, and any other self-defined code) on 
   different networks (e.g. TCP/IP network, constrained network) into 
   their corresponding "machine-friendly" addresses or other related 
   information of another TCP/IP or constrained network. The object of 
   IoT based on a TCP/IP or constrained network can easily communicate 
   with other object on the same or any other network with the name of 
   the object by object name service, without considering whether the 
   address of the targeted object has been changed or not. 

   To fulfill the aforementioned objective, object naming service based 
   on the IoT needs to be researched. The compatibility of heterogeneous 
   name spaces and the efficiency for the constrained network of this 
   kind of service are supposed to be the most important issues to be 
   studied in future. 

    

5.3. Security/privacy/authority 

   The loss of security and privacy in communications and services, with 
   personal data is becoming available and unwanted communication 
   becoming rampant. 

   The overall problem is further aggravated by the diversification of 
   the Internet with new types of devices and heterogeneous networks.

      The Internet of Things - Concept and Problem Statement   April 2011 
                                                                       
                                    
   The user is confronted with a wide range of methods and devices with 
   which to access the digital world, and it can no longer be assumed 
   that a single, independent access per device will suffice, nor that 
   the user will actually own all these devices. 

   Solution: 

   o ID-management for things (security, authentication, privacy) 

      Basically each object should not be able to authenticate during 
      the short time because the hundreds of objects may request the 
      approval at the same time. Therefore, group authentication and 
      authorization methods are required.  

    

5.4. Presence (of people; of devices) 

5.5. Geographic location (self identification of location) 

    

   o awareness of location 

    

5.6. Discovery/search 

5.7. Tracking of mobile object 

   Solution: 

   o TBD 

      To support the routing and mobility protocols, the IoT networks 
      have structural characteristics. That is, the mobility support 
      models are required. Some objects move independently. Others will 
      move as the one of group. Therefore, according the moving feature, 
      the different tracking methods are required. 

    

5.8. Data processing /computing 

   For supporting various applications in the IoT environment, 
   information should be able to transfer among objects operating under 
   varied perspectives without humans.

   Solutions 

   o Information model (data store, retrieval, transfer, etc) 

      According the Information model, the functionality of data 
      processing should be distinguished.  

   o Policy/preferences 

    

5.9. Heterogeneous networking interfaces (IP and non-IP, etc) 

    

   o Interworking model with proxy (gateway) 

      Each gateway should support the multiple interfaces, which are 
      evolved in different heterogeneous network.  

    

5.10. Global connectivity (IPv6) 

      Each object should support the end-to-end communications. And also 
      outside-initiated services may be supported into the inner network. 

    

5.11. Scalability 

      In IETF LISP, Shim6 and Other WG, ID/LOC separation methods have 
      been developing. For more scalable and robust network, ID/LOC 
      separation features are required. 

    

5.12. Universal interoperability 

5.13. Autonomics (self-configuring, intelligence for control) 

    

   o Remote control and management/maintenance of objects

      The Internet of Things - Concept and Problem Statement   April 2011 
                                                                       
                                    
      IPv6 auto-configuration and multi-homing features are useful for 
      the autonomics. The scope-based IPv6 addressing features are 
      easily applied for self-configuration such as smart building and 
      smart grid.  

    

5.14. Power/energy storage 

5.15. Coordination among many objects 

      Like the Full-function device (FFD) and Reduced Function Devices 
      (RFD) in sensor network, the objects of IoT should be classified 
      in viewpoint of functionalities. 

       

5.16. Web Services 

      Each object may be identified through the web services. It means 
      that the object should be identified by the URL/URL. 

    

6. Summary and future work 

   This document has explained the concept of the Internet of Things and 
   several characteristics of objects. In addition, this document has 
   investigated key technical issues and specifies problems for the IoT. 

   For future work, we need to find possible solutions for each problem. 
   It would be a good starting point to develop a new architectural 
   framework in order to solve problems.  

    

7. Security Considerations 

   TBD 

    

8. IANA Considerations 

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Internet-Draft                6RD Over UDP                     July 2010


1.  Introduction

   6rd protocol [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd] enables service providers
   to rapidly deploy IPv6 over IPv4 network.  In [RFC5569], it describes
   the 6rd architecture to enable a service provider to deploy IPv6
   connectivity on an IPv4 network for 1.5 million residential
   customers.  The architecture involves two major components: (1) the
   6rd relays (6rd Border Router) in the ISP network and (2) 6rd CPE
   (6rd CE) in the customer premise.

   The 6rd CE in the customer home is a NAT [RFC3022] device which
   shares a single external IPv4 address to multiple internal IPv4
   hosts.  Note that the external IPv4 address can be either public or
   private.  If private address is used, the ISP will provide NAT
   function in the provider network.  Details is described in [RFC5569]
   Section 4.  The 6rd CE is also an IPv6 router which advertises an
   IPv6 prefix (6rd Delegated Prefix) to the internal IPv6 hosts.  The
   6rd Delegated Prefix consists of two part: the 6rd Prefix and the
   external IPv4 address.  The 6rd CE learns the 6rd Prefix,
   IPv4MaskLen, and 6rdPrefixLen from DHCP [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd]
   and calculate the 6rd Delegated Prefix.  Then, the 6rd CE advertises
   the 6rd Delegated Prefix to the customer's home network via Router
   Advertisement [RFC4861] or DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   The 6rd specification fits well to those ISPs who manage the
   customers' home gateway (HGW).  When the ISP is ready to deploy the
   6rd, a new firmware which contains the 6rd CE implementation will be
   pushed to the managed HGW.  For the ISPs who do not manage the
   customers' HWG, they cannot upgrade the customer's HWGs to support
   6rd.  This memo specific a UDP encapsulation to encapsulate 6rd over
   UDP which enables ISP to deploy 6rd to hosts behind unmodified HWG.
   There are two scenarios in which the ISP can use this specification.

   1.  First deployment scenario is the O/S in the host implements this
       specification.  The host is connect to the unmodified HGW's LAN
       interface.  One the host establishes IPv4 connectivity, it
       initiates the 6rd discovery procedure Section 5 and construct the
       6rd Delegated Prefix.  When the host sends an IPv6 datagram, it
       encapsulates the IPv4 datagram with a standard UDP header
       [RFC0768], then it encapsulates the IPv6 datagram in an IPv4
       header following the procedure defined in [RFC5569].  Details of
       the UDP encapsulation is described in Section 4.

   2.  Second deployment scenario is a dedicated server implements this
       specification.  The server is connected to the unmodified HGW's
       LAN interface.  Once the server establishes IPv4 connectivity, it
       initiates the 6rd discovery procedure Section 5 and construct the
       6rd Delegated Prefix.  Then, it advertises the 6rd Prefix via

       Router Advertisement or DHCPv6 to the HGW LAN so that IPv6
       datagram will use the server as a gateway to establish IPv6
       sessions.  This enables the hosts connecting to the HGW's LAN to
       access 6rd service without additional configuration.

   This specification defines the udp encapsulation that allows to
   deploy 6rd behind a 6rd unaware NAT-ed gateway.  The general
   mechanism is still stateless and requires little change to the IPv4
   networking.


2.  Terminology

   This documents users terms defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd].
   In addition, we defines the following new terms:

   o  HGW: is referred to the edge device installed in customer home.
      It typically provides NAT function to the home equipments.  The
      HGW in this context is unaware of 6rd.

   o  External IPv4 address: is referred to the external IPv4 address
      assigned by the ISP to the HGW.  This address can be either a
      public IPv4 address of a private [RFC1918] address.

   o  Internal IPv4 address: is referred to the internal IPv4 address
      assigned by the HGW to the 6rd host.  This address is a [RFC1918]
      address.

   o  6rd UDP Host: is the host implemented this specification.

   o  6rd UDP Delegated Prefix: is referred to the 6rd Delegated Prefix
      [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd] generated by the 6rd BR to identify
      the host implemented this specification.  The 6rd UDP Delegated
      Prefix is different from the 6rd Delegated Prefix in which the 16-
      bit udp source port information is part of the 6rd delegated
      prefix calculation.

   o  6rd UDP Host Delegated Prefix: is referred to the 6rd Delegated
      Prefix used by the host.  This is different from the 6rd UDP
      Delegated Prefix in which the 16-bit udp source port information
      in the IPv6 address will be replaced by zeros.

Internet-Draft                6RD Over UDP                     July 2010


3.1.  6rd UDP Host

   Before the host can use 6rd, it needs to discover five pieces of
   information: the 6rd prefix, the external IPv4 address, the
   IPv4MaskLen, the 6rdPreflixLen, and the 6rd BR IPv4 address.
   Section 5 discusses the process to discover the information.  The
   host calculates the 6rd UDP Host Delegated Prefix following the
   procedure described in Section 3.5.

   The 6rd udp host implemented this specification must be able to
   encapsulate and de-capsulate udp and IPv4 headers when sending and
   receiving IPv6 datagrams.  It must also allocate an available udp
   port during startup.  This port must be used in the 6rd encapsulation
   during the life time of the process.

   When the host wants to initiate an IPv6 session to an outside IPv6
   host, the first encapsulates is to append the IPv6 datagram with an
   udp header.  The udp source port is the udp port allocated at
   startup; the destination port is an IANA defined port.  The second
   encapsulate is to append the IPv4 header.  The source address will be
   the internal IPv4 address assigned by the HGW; the destination
   address will be the 6rd BR's IPv4 address.

   Since 6rd udp host is behind the HGW, it must send a keepalive
   message to the 6rd BR to maintain the udp NAT binding alive.  The
   keepalive is a simple udp packet which has special IPv6 destination
   address so that the 6rd BR will rsecognize this is a keepalive
   packet.  When the 6rd receives this special udp datagram, it must
   discard the datagram and sends a response to the 6rd udp host.  In
   the response, the IPv6 address contains only the 6rd udp delegated
   prefix and zero-pad the rest of the bits.  When the 6rd udp host
   receives this datagram.  It must discard it.  The 6rd udp host must
   send the keepalive frequent enough to keep the binding.

3.2.  Home Gateway

   The HGW in this specification is a typical HGW found in retailed
   stores.  In the WAN side, it connects to the ISP and runs DHCP
   client.  The ISP offers an IPv4 address, a default gateway, and list
   of DNS servers to the HGW.  In the LAN side, it runs DHCP server and
   offers [RFC1918] address to the hosts on the LAN.  The HGW provides
   standard NAT [RFC3022] functions to allow multiple hosts to share a
   single external IPv4 address.  When a host connects to the HGW, the
   host requests the Internal IPv4 address and the Internal IPv4 Gateway
   via DHCP.  The HGW is not aware of the 6rd service.

Internet-Draft                6RD Over UDP                     July 2010


3.3.  6rd Border Router

   The 6rd BR implemented this specification must be configured to
   receive UDP packet on port XXXX (TBD) in its IPv4 interface facing
   the 6rd udp hosts.  When it receives a udp packet, it de-capsulates
   the udp header and extract the udp source port information.  Then it
   replaces the 16-bit zero-padded bit to the udp source port
   information and forms the 6rd delegated prefix.  The 6rd BR must be
   pre-configured with the IPv4MaxLen and 6rdPrefixLen.

   When the 6rd BR receives an IPv6 packet in its IPv6 interface, it
   must extract the 16-bit udp source port from the IPv6 destination
   address and use it to construct the udp header for encapsulation.
   The 6rd BR must also zero-pad the 16-bit udp source port information
   in the IPv6 destination address before sending to the 6rd udp host.

   The 6rd BR performs the stateless header replacement function to
   embed the NAT-ed udp port information into the 6rd prefix.

3.4.  6rd UDP Delegated Prefix

   In order to keep 6rd BR operation stateless and to make 6rd
   implementations co-exist with the HGW NAT at the same time, this
   specification defines a new 6rd delegated prefix
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd] calculation procedure which is slightly
   different from the classic 6rd delegated prefix calculation.  This
   specification proposes to include the 16-bit UDP source port
   information in the 6rd delegated prefix.

   The 6rd udp delegated prefix is calculated by concatenating the 6rd
   prefix, a consecutive set of bits from the CE IPv4 address, and the
   16-bit udp source port.  The sum of the number of bits must be less
   than or equal to 64.

   For example, the 6rd prefix is 2001:DB8::/32; the IPv4 address is
   192.0.1.100/24; the IPv4MaskLen is 16; the 6rdPrefixLen is 32; and
   the source UDP is 12345.  The 6rd udp delegated prefix is 2001:DB8:
   0164:3039::/64

   The 6rd udp delegated prefix is generated and used by 6rd BR.

3.5.  6rd UDP Host Delegated Prefix

   Since the 6rd Host calculating the delegrated prefix is behind the
   NAT, it does not know the NAT-ed udp source port.  When the 6rd
   constructs the 6rd UDP Delegated Prefix, it will not populate the 16-
   bit UDP source port information.  Instead, it will zero-pad the 16-
   bit field.  This will also ensure that the 6rd udp host delegated

   prefix will not change if the old NAT-ed binding in the HGW expires
   and a new binding is formed.

   Following the previous example, the 6rd host udp delegated prefix
   behind the HGW is 2001:DB8:0164::/64

   The 6rd udp host delegated prefix is used by the 6rd udp host.

3.6.  Procedures

3.6.1.  Outbound Flow from the 6rd UDP Host

3.6.1.1.  6rd UDP Host

   When the 6rd udp operation on the host starts, it must allocate an
   available udp port.  This port is used in the source udp port of the
   udp encapsulation.

   When the 6rd host wants to send an IPv6 datagram to an IPv6
   destination, it puts the 6rd udp host delegated prefix in the source
   IPv6 address field.  Then the host encapsulates the IPv6 datagram
   with a udp header.  The source port is the udp port allocated during
   the startup process and the destination port is the well-known port
   assigned by IANA.  Then, the host encapsulates the udp datagram with
   an IPv4 header.  The IPv4 header contains the 6rd BR in the
   destination address field and the internal IPv4 address in the source
   address field.  The datagram is passed to the relevant routing
   mechanism.

3.6.1.2.  Home Gateway

   When the HGW receives the first udp datagram, it NATs the source port
   and source IPv4 address to create a NAT binding in its table.  Then,
   the HGW forwards the IPv4 udp datagram to the 6rd BR.  Any subsequent
   udp datagram designating the same udp port and IPv4 address from the
   same udp port and IPv4 address will use the same NAT binding.  This
   specification contains no new requirement to the HGW.

3.6.1.3.  6rd Border Router

   When the 6rd BR receives the udp datagram, it de-capsulates the IPv4
   and udp headers, and extracts the 16-bit udp source port information
   in the udp header.  Then, it calculates a new IPv6 source address by
   replacing the 6rd udp host delegated prefix with the 6rd udp
   delegated prefix.  Then, the 6rd BR forwards the IPv6 datagram to the
   IPv6 destination.

3.6.2.  Inbound Flow from the Subscriber IPv6 Host

3.6.2.1.  6rd Border Router

   When the 6rd BR receives the IPv6 datagram, it extracts the 16-bit
   udp destination port information from the IPv6 destination address.
   It calculates the new IPv6 destination address by replacing the 6rd
   udp delegated address with the 6rd udp host delegated address.  It
   also constructs the udp header by putting the extracted 16-bit into
   the destination port and XXXX (TBD) in the source port.  Finally, the
   6rd BR extracts the IPv4 address from the IPv6 destination address,
   encapsulate the IPv6 datagram with the udp header and IPv4 header,
   and forward it to the provider network.

3.6.2.2.  Home Gateway

   When the HGW receives the IPv4 datagram, it performs the standard NAT
   function by replacing the destination IPv4 address and udp
   destination port to the address and port stored in the NAT binding
   table.  Then, it forwards the datagram to the host in the LAN.  This
   specification contains no new requirement to the HGW.

3.6.2.3.  6rd UDP Host

   When the 6rd host receives the datagram.  It de-capsulates the udp
   and IPv4 headers and forwards the IPv6 datagram to its IPv6 interface
   or to connected destination.

3.7.  Examples

3.7.1.  Host Model

   This example explains how the Host Model works.  Both 6rd Host A and
   6rd Host B learn the 6rd prefix via static or dynamic configuration.
   They also learn the external IPv4 address by some external mechanism.
   Host A and Host B create the 6rd delegated prefix by concatenating
   6rd prefix, the external IPv4 address, and pads 16-bit at the end of
   the external IPv4 address.  The resulting 6rd udp host delegated
   prefix must be less than or equal to 64.

   This example is very similar to the Host Model.  Instead of the host
   implementing this specification, only a server device is required to
   implement this specification.  The server uses the same mechanism
   described in the Host Model to construct the 6rd udp host delegated
   prefix.  When the server is ready to provide the 6rd service, it
   announces the 6rd udp host delegated prefix in the Router
   Advertisement.  Client A and Client B receive the 6rd udp host
   delegated Prefix and auto-config the IPv6 interface.

   o  Destination Port must be the well-known port assigned by IANA.

   o  this specification does not introduce new requirement to the IPv4

5.  6rd Border Router Discovery

   In the classic 6rd framework, the 6rd CE connects directly to the
   ISP.  The ISP uses DHCP to pass the 6rd Prefix, IPv4MaskLen,
   6rdPrefixLen, and the 6rd BR address to the CPE CE.  In this
   specification, the 6rd host is not directly connected to the ISP.
   Between the ISP and the 6rd host, there is a HGW which is unaware of
   6rd.  The ISP can't use DHCP to pass the necessary information to the
   6rd hosts.  In this specification, we suggest two discovery
   mechanisms.

5.1.  Manual Discovery

   The ISP gives the customers the 6rd Prefix, IPv4MaskLen,
   6rdPreflixLen, and 6rd BR information.  If the customers want to
   start the 6rd service, they must enter the information manually.
   This method is only feasible in very small scale deployment and not
   recommended for any large scale deployment.

5.2.  Automatic Discovery

   The ISP uses RADIUS [RFC2865] or DIAMETER [RFC3588] to distribute the
   6rd Prefix, IPv4MaskLen, 6rdPrefixlen, and 6rd BR address
   information.  When the customer starts the 6rd service, he/she must
   authenticate him/herself to the ISP.  Upon a successful
   authentication, he/she will be given the necessary parameters through
   either RADIUS or DIAMETER response.


6.  MTU

   Similar to other tunnel encapsulations, this specification reduces
   the effect MTU size.  The encapsulation overhead is 20-byte for IPv4
   header and 8-byte for UDP.  The host and 6rd BR must account for this

   overhead.


7.  Comparison to the Classic 6rd

   This specification is considered more restrictive than the classic
   6rd.  There are three major areas:

7.1.  6rd Prefix Length

   In the classic 6rd model, the maximum 6rd Prefix length can be as
   long as 32 + IPv4MaskLen.  In this specification, the maximum 6rd
   Prefix length is 16 + IPv4MaskLen due to encapsulating the udp source
   port information in the 6rd udp delegated prefix.

7.2.  Additional 6rd BR Operation

   In the classic 6rd architecture, the 6rd BR does a simple de-
   capsulation and encapsulation.  When the 6rd BR receives a udp
   datagram from the ISP network, the 6rd BR must calculate a new IPv6
   source address after the de-capsulation.  The new IPv6 source address
   contains the 6rd udp delegated prefix in which the udp source port
   information is embedded in it.  When the 6rd BR receives an IPv6
   datagram from the IPv6 Internet, it reverses the process by replacing
   the 6rd udp delegated prefix to the 6rd host udp delegated prefix.

7.3.  Life Time of 6rd Delegated Prefix

   In classic 6rd model, the life time of the 6rd delegate prefix is
   bounced by the life time of the external IPv4 address.  The life time
   of the external IPv4 address could be hours or even days.  In this
   specification, the life time of the 6rd udp delegated prefix is
   bounced by the life time of the NAT binding in the HGW.  The HGW can
   expire the udp binding if there is no traffic passing for few
   seconds.  This specification requires the 6rd udp host to send
   keepalive to the 6rd BR to refresh the binding frequently.  However,
   the 6rd host udp delegated prefix used in the LAN will not suffer
   from the same short-lived interval.  Since the 6rd host udp delegated
   prefix does not contain the udp port information, its life time is
   equal to 6rd delegated prefix which is bounced by the life time of
   the IPv4 external address.


8.  Comparison to Softwire Hub-and-Spoke and Teredo

   Softwire Hub-and-Spoke [RFC5571] and Teredo [RFC4380] are two
   protocols that provide IPv6 connectivity to hosts behind typical HGW.
   Softwire Hub-and-Spoke uses L2TPv2 over UDP [RFC2661] for the tunnel

   protocol; Teredo defines its own tunneling protocol for UDP
   encapsulation.  This specification provides similar functionality.
   The benefit of this specification is that the operation is stateless
   and requires no control protocol.  However, this specification
   require external bootstrapping process to pass provisioning
   information to the 6rd udp host.


9.  Deployment Considerations

   The same 6rd BR can support both classic 6rd and 6rd UDP
   encapsulation.  To achieve this, the classic 6rd and 6rd udp
   encapsulation must use different 6rd prefixes.  In a deployment
   scenario where customers have mixed 6rd CE and typical HGW, this
   specification potentially saves operation cost by deploying only one
   type of network equipment.  This specification also useful for
   operator to speedup the 6rd deployment process by offering users a
   softwire download of 6rd udp host which works behind their home
   gateways, and for users who do not want to change their home
   gateways.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests IANA to assign a UDP port for the 6rd UDP
   encapsulation.

1. Introduction 

   The one of new capabilities for future network will be the ubiquitous 
   networking such as the Internet of things. This networking capability 
   should support "Any Time, Any Where, Any Service, Any Network and Any 
   Object (so-called "5-Any")" operation. In order to connect objects 
   (e.g., devices and/or machines) to large databases and networks, a 
   simple, unobtrusive and cost-effective system of item identification 
   is crucial. The concept of host should be extended to support all of 
   types objects. However, there is no consideration for certain new 
   type of objects (e.g., contents, RFID tags, sensors, etc) as end 
   points.  

   This document describes object to object communications. For 
   identification of network entities, we consider new type of 
   identifiers (e.g., RFID code, content ID, etc) for objects and 
   propose specific requirements for object identification in naming 
   point of view.  

   For architectural aspect, this document shows architecture for 
   identity processing and mapping relationship between several 
   identities with conceptual diagram for providing connectivity to 
   objects.  

   According to several alternative architectures for object naming, 
   this document aims to provide requirements and right direction for 
   protocol development for realization of object to object 
   communications.  

 

2. Object to Object Communications 

2.1. Definition of object 

   object: a model of an entity. An object is characterized by its 
   behavior. An object is distinct from any other object. An object 
   interacts with its environment including other objects at its 
   interaction points. An object is informally said to perform functions 
   and offer services (an object which performs a function available to 
   other entities and/or objects is said to offer a service). For 
   modeling purposes, these functions and services are specified in 
   terms of the behavior of the object and of its interfaces. An object 
   can perform more than one function. A function can be performed by 
   the cooperation of several objects.

     Naming Architecture for Object to Object Communications   March 2010 
                                     
                                     
   NOTE - Objects include terminal devices (e.g. used by a person to 
   access the network such as mobile phones, personal computers, etc), 
   remote monitoring devices (e.g. cameras, sensors, etc), information 
   devices (e.g. content delivery server), products, contents, and 
   resources. 

   NOTE - the above definition was quoted from ITU-T [Y.2002]. 

2.2. Concept of object to object communications 

   For ubiquitous networking [Y.2002], future network will require the 
   extensions of networking functionalities to all objects. New 
   networking concept will be considered for networking capabilities to 
   support various classes of applications/services which support "Any 
   Time, Any Where, Any Service, Any Network and Any Object" operation 
   using Internet. This networking capability should support human-to-
   human, human-to-object (e.g., device and/or machine) and object-to-
   object communications. 

2.3. Various types of objects 

   There are many different kinds of devices connecting to the network 
   supported for ubiquitous networking in Internet. RFID tag, sensors, 
   smart cards, medical devices, navigation devices, vehicles as well as 
   the existing personal devices such as PC, Smartphones are examples of 
   these. This document considers that the end points which are not 
   always humans but may be objects such as devices /machines, and then 
   expanding to small objects and parts of objects.  

   The object means that the user or other entity which is connected to 
   the network. It includes almost everything around us such as remote 
   monitoring and information device/machine/content, etc.  

   Figure 1 shows the connection of Internet with the relationship 
   between humans and objects in terms of identification and location in 
   specifically mobile environments. The types of objects on the end-
   user side include the following: personal devices, information 
   devices, RFID/sensors, contents, appliances, vehicles, etc.

3. Object Identification 

3.1. Classification of network entities to be identified 

   There are several network entities to be identified in the network. 
   These network entities have a layered architecture and are used for 
   naming, addressing and routing. 

   o  Services (i.e., information related to applications/services) 

   o  End points (i.e., global unique identifier) 

   o  Location (i.e., IP address) 

   o  Path (i.e., routing) 

   In particular, for object to object communications, information for 
   several kinds of object on top of end points should be identified in 
   the network.

3.2. Identification codes 

   Identification of all objects for providing end-to-end connectivity 
   in ubiquitous networking environment is crucial. An identifier is 
   capable of identifying all objects and facilitates objects-to-objects 
   communications. In particular, a globally unique identifier enables a 
   lot of applications including item tracking, access control, and 
   protection, etc [1]. 

   There are many kinds of identifiers such as E.164 numbering plan, 
   Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)-64, Media Access Control (MAC) 
   address, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)/ Uniform Resource Locator 
   (URL), etc.  

   These identification codes can be classified as follows. 

   o  Object IDs: include RFID, Content ID, telephone number, URL/URI, 
      etc 

   o  Communication IDs: include session/protocol ID, IP address, MAC 
      address, etc 

   In this document basically consider an "Object ID" which generally 
   takes the form of an application-specific integer or pointer that 
   uniquely identifies an object. 

3.3. Examples of IDs for objects 

3.3.1. RFID 

   The identification codes, so-called Electronic Product Code (EPC), 
   for RFID/sensors are very important in ubiquitous networking 
   environment. An EPC is simply a number assigned to an RFID tag 
   representative of an actual electronic product code. Their value is 
   that they have been carefully characterized and categorized to embed 
   certain meanings within their structure. Each number is encoded with 
   a header, identifying the particular EPC version used for coding the 
   entire EPC number. An EPC manager number is defined, allowing 
   individual companies or organizations to be uniquely identified; an 
   object class number is present, identifying objects used within this 
   organization, such as product types. Finally, a serial number is 
   characterized, allowing the unique identification of each individual 
   object tagged by the organization [2].

3.3.2. Content ID 

   The Content ID is a unique identifier that can specify and 
   distinguish any kind of digital content that is distributed. As a 
   unique code attached to a content object, the Content ID serves well 
   enough as an identifier, but actually it is much more than just that. 
   It is also the key to a complete set of attribute information about a 
   content object stored as metadata including the nature of the 
   contents, rights-related information, information about distribution, 
   and more. The Content ID provides the key enabling metadata to be 
   uniquely associated with a particular digital object [3].                 

3.4. Requirements for naming using object identification 

   For object to object communications, how to map/bind IP address (i.e., 
   communications IDs) with other identifiers (i.e., object IDs) for 
   providing end-to-end IP connectivity is challenging issue.  

   Additionally, the following features should be provided using naming 
   capability through object identification.  

   o  Scalability with enough name space to support new devices/machines 
      enabling communications 

   o  Protection of object (including right management) using security 
      function 

   o  Connecting to anything for providing the connectivity to end 
      device without additional equipment such as Network Address 
      Translator using object identification 

   o  Service and location discovery through performing two functions; 
      Routing using network prefix information and identification code 
      using object IDs 

    

4. Naming Architecture for Objects 

4.1. Layered architecture for identity processing 

   As shown in Figure 2, the layered architecture of identity processing 
   requires  specific  processing  capabilities  at  each  layer.  Each 
   user/object in applications identifies by identity like name with a 
   set of attributes of an entity. An attribute can be thought of as 
   metadata that belongs to a specific entity in a specific context, 
   some of which could to be highly private or sensitive. The identity

   should be associated with object IDs through identification and 
   authorization.  Each  object  ID  also  should  be  associated  with 
   communication IDs through mapping/binding [Y.ipv6-ID].

4.2. The mapping relationships between host and object(s) 

   In this document, host means a device that communicates using the 
   Internet protocols (i.e., IP addresses). 

4.2.1. Host = Object (one to one mapping) 

   In case of a host is equal to an object, there is one to one mapping 
   relationship between host and object. Most of information devices 
   such as PC, etc are included in this case.  

   Current HIP has been typically designed for this case. 

4.2.2. Host =! Object (one to many mapping) 

   In case of a host is not equal to an object, there is one to many 
   mapping relationship between host and object(s). Content server, RFID 
   tags/Reader, etc are included in this case. 

   There are two kinds of one to many mapping as follows (see Figure 3): 

   o  As shown in Figure 3 (a), host including objects such as content 
      server, a host includes many objects and these objects should be 
      identified using content ID, etc. 

   o  As shown in Figure 3 (b), host with remote objects such as RFID 
      tags, a host has many remote objects and these objects should be 
      identified using RFID code, etc. In this case, each object might 
      be non IP. 

    

4.3. The stack architecture 

   The original stack architecture of HIP can be extended according to 
   the mapping relationships between host and object(s). 

   o  As shown in Figure 4 (a), objects in a host (case #1), the end 
      point is the same with current HIP architecture. However, each 
      object in service layer should be identified by a host using 
      mapping protocol for object. 

   o  As shown in Figure 4 (b), remote objects (case #2), the end point 
      will be each object. This means that host location is different 
      from end point(s). Thus, current HIP should be extended to support 
      several end points with a host. From object information in service 
      layer, each object identity should be defined.

4.4. Object mapping schemes 

   There are two kinds of object mapping schemes using one to many 
   mapping relationship as follows: 

   o  Direct mapping (Figure 4 (a)) 

      An object at application layer is directly reachable to host 
      entity at network attachment point which IP is terminated. An 
      object is located on top of TCP/IP protocol stack. For example, 
      host including objects such as content server, a host includes 
      many objects and these objects should be identified using content 
      ID, etc. 

   o  Indirect mapping (Figure 4 (b)) 

      An object at application layer is remotely reachable through non-
      IP interface to host entity at network attachment point which IP 
      is terminated. An object is located outside of physical network 
      attachment which IP is terminated. For example, host with remote 
      objects such as RFID tags, a host has many remote objects and 
      these objects should be identified using RFID code, etc. In this 
      case, each object might be non IP.

4.5. Providing connectivity to objects 

   For providing connectivity to objects using object identification, 
   the Figure 5 shows object mapping/ binding with IP address for IP 
   connectivity to all objects in end-user side. This scheme can provide 
   the  global  connectivity  with  Internet  to  objects  through  the 
   association (e.g., mapping/binding) between identifier for object and 
   IP address.

5. Considerations of Protocols for Naming Objects 

5.1. Security association 

   It is critical to provide security association for secure binding 
   between object identity and IP address similar with HIP [5].  

    

5.2. Support of DNS 

   An ID resolution server such as Domain Name System (DNS), can provide 
   a function to translate the identifier of object into service 
   /communication ID to access networking services provided by 
   database/application servers. 

   In order to support from existing infrastructure, including DNS, it 
   is required to define DNS resource records. The newly defined DNS 
   resource records should include information on object IDs.  

    

5.3. Protocol overhead 

   Real time communications and some limitation of power and packet size, 
   lightweight identity handshake for datagram transactions is critical. 

    

5.4. Common identifier for object 

   Most of identifiers for object specified with different format 
   according to applications. However, in order to contain information 
   of all objects in protocol message and interoperate globally, it is 
   required to specify common identifier and rules to accommodate all 
   objects with unified format. 

    

5.5. Relationship with locator for mobile object 

   As the location of object(s) is frequently changed in mobile 
   environment, the information of object ID should be resolved with the 
   information of location. It is required to use the concept of 
   ID/Locator separation considering object ID.

5.6. Specific user cases 

   Naming protocol for object can use original advantages of HIP for 
   specific user cases. 

   o  Identity-based roaming and mobility 

   o  Hierarchical routing 

   o  Addressing and location management 

   o  Multi-homing 

   o  Rendezvous service (or mechanism) 

   o  DNS service 

    

5.7. Services using naming objects 

   The proposed naming objects can provide an integrated solution for 
   personal location and management through identification /naming 
   /addressing including ID registration, location tracking, dynamic 
   mobility control, and security using the following networking 
   services: 

   o  Identity management (IdM) services for the management of the 
      identity life cycle of objects including managing unique IDs, 
      attributes, credentials, entitlements to consistently enforce 
      business and security policies. 

   o  Location management services for real-time location tracking, 
      monitoring, and information processing of moving objects similar 
      with Supply Chain Management. 

   o  Networked ID (N-ID) services for providing communication service 
      which is triggered by an identification process started via 
      reading an identifier from identifier storage such as RFID tag, 
      barcode label, smartcard, etc. 

   o  Home networking services for the management of multiple object 
      identities in a host and/or remote host using RFID tag, ubiquitous 
      sensor, etc.

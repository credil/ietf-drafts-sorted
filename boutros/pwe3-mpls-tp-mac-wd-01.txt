1. Introduction 

     An LDP-based MAC Address Withdrawal Mechanism is specified in 
   RFC4762 [2] to remove dynamically learned MAC addresses when the 
   source of those addresses can no longer forward traffic. This is 
   accomplished by sending an LDP Address Withdraw Message with a MAC 
   List TLV containing the MAC addressed to be removed to all other PEs 
   over LDP sessions. When the number of MAC addresses to be removed is 
   large, empty MAC List TLV may be used. [3] describes an optimized MAC 
   withdrawal mechanism which can be used to remove only the set of MAC 
   addresses that need to be re-learned in H-VPLS networks. The solution 
   also provides optimized MAC Withdrawal operations in PBB-VPLS 
   networks. 

   A PW can be signaled via LDP or can be statically provisioned. In the 
   case of static PW, LDP based MAC withdrawal mechanism cannot be used. 
   This is analogous to the problem and solution described in [4] where 
   PW OAM message has been introduced to carry PW status TLV using in-
   band PW Associated Channel. In this document, we propose to use PW 
   OAM message to withdraw MAC address(es) learned via static PW.

3. MAC Withdraw OAM Message 

     LDP provides a reliable packet transport for control plackets for 
   dynamic PWs. This can be contrasted with static PWs which rely on re-
   transmission and acknowledgments (ACK) for reliable OAM packet 
   delivery as described in [4]. The proposed solution for MAC 
   withdrawal over static PW also relies on re-transmissions and ACKs. 
   However, ACK is mandatory. A given MAC withdrawal notification is 
   sent as a PW OAM message, and the sender keeps re-transmitting the 
   message until it receives an ACK for that message. Once a receiver 
   successfully remove MAC address(es) in response to a MAC address 
   withdraw OAM message, it should not unnecessarily remove MAC 
   address(es) upon getting refresh message(s). To facilitate this, the

   proposed mechanism uses sequence number, and defines a new TLV to 
   carry the sequence number. 

   The format of the MAC address withdraw OAM message is shown in Figure 
   1. The PW OAM message header is exactly the same as what is defined 
   in [4]. Since the MAC withdrawal PW OAM message is not refreshed for 
   ever, the "Refresh Timer" field in the message header is not used. A 
   MAC address withdraw OAM message MUST contain a "Sequence Number TLV" 
   otherwise the entire message is dropped. It may contain PE-ID or MAC 
   Flush Parameter TLVs defined in [3] when static PWs are deployed in 
   H-VPLS and PBB-VPLS scenarios. The sequence number TLV has U 
   (Unknown) and F (Forward) bits set to 1 and 0 respectively so that if 
   a receiver does not recognize the TLV, it drops the whole message. 

   In this section, MAC List TLV, PE-ID TLV, and MAC Flush Parameter TLV 
   are collectively referred to as "MAC TLV(s)". The processing rules of 
   MAC List TLV is governed by [2], and the corresponding rules of PE-ID 
   TLV and MAC Flush Parameter TLV are governed by [3].

   Figure 1 except that: 

       . A-bit is set. 

       . It does not include MAC TLV(s).

Internet-Draft  draft-boutros-pwe3-mpls-tp-mac-wd-01.txt      March 2011 
    

       . It must include the Sequence Number TLV. 

4. Operation 

     This section describes how the initial MAC withdraw OAM messages 
   are sent and retransmitted, as well as how the messages are processed 
   and retransmitted messages are identified.  

4.1.1. Operation of Sender 

   Each PW is associated with a counter to keep track of the sequence 
   number of the transmitted MAC withdrawal messages. Whenever a node 
   sends a new set of MAC TLVs, it increments the transmitted sequence 
   number counter, and include the new sequence number in the message. 

   The sender expects an ACK from the receiver within a time interval 
   which we call "Retransmit Time" which can be either a default or 
   configured value. If the ACK arrives within the Retransmit Time, the 
   sender assumes that the message transmission is successful. 
   Otherwise, it retransmits the message with the same sequence number 
   as the original message. 

4.1.2. Operation of Receiver 

   Each PW is associated with a counter to keep track of the sequence 
   number of the MAC withdrawal message received last. Whenever a MAC 
   withdrawal message is received, and if the sequence number on the 
   message is greater than the receive counter, the MAC address(es) 
   contained in the MAC TLV(s) is/are removed, and the receive counter 
   is incremented. The receiver sends an ACK whose sequence number is 
   the same as the received message. 

   If the sequence number in the received message is smaller than or 
   equal to the receive counter, the MAC TLV(s) is/are not processed. 
   However, an ACK whose sequence number is the same as the received 
   message is sent. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any additional security constraints. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA needs to assign the type value for Sequence Number TLV.

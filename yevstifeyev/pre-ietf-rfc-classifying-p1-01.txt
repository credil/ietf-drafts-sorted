INTERNET DRAFT   Pre-IETF RFCs Classifying: RFCs 1-100 November 29, 2010


1.  Introduction

   There are near 800 RFCs on the RFC Editor's archive with no definite
   status. This was caused by the time these RFCs were published at.
   Early RFCs (also called as 'Pre-IETF') were classified and marked
   according to RFC 100 [RFC100]. RFC 2026 [RFC2026] mentioned that all
   RFCs must be classified as 'Standards Track', 'Experimental',
   'Informational', 'Best Current Practice' or 'Historic'. In order to
   conform to this requirements, the series of document, which assign
   Pre-IETF RFCs to one of the aforementioned status, were made.

   This document classifies RFCs 1-100 in accordance with RFC 2026
   [RFC2026].

INTERNET DRAFT                    EUDP                    April 28, 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document is a specification of experimental Extendable User
   Datagram Protocol (EUDP), which is based on User Datagram Protocol
   (UDP) [RFC0768], but allows to extend its header and, therefore, its
   functionality with options.

   Such solution may be useful in the situations when UDP provides lack
   of features while other transport-layer protocols, such as
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC0793] or Datagram Congestion
   Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340], have excessive facilities, which
   might not be needed in such particular case.  Current transport-layer
   protocols are not able to cope with such situations.  

   Unlike them, EUDP allows to choose what features it will provide to
   the users via the options.  Options allow to append different
   capabilities to EUDP's core transport functionality.  Therefore, it
   may suit to almost any requirements.

   Please note that EUDP is experimental protocol.  Therefore any
   suggestions for improvements and comments, directed to the author of
   this document, are encouraged and welcome.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Protocol Description

2.1. Lower Layer Protocols Considerations

   EUDP is a transport-layer protocol, per RFC 1122 [RFC1122] (Layer 4
   in Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model [OSI]).  It is
   implemented on the top of Internet Protocol (IP).  EUDP SHALL support
   as IPv4 [RFC0791], as IPv6 [RFC2460] as lower-layer protocol.  The IP
   Protocol number to be used with EUDP is TBD1. 

   Moreover, EUDP SHALL be able to operate on the any protocol that
   provides the same functionality as IP, such as EIP (Extended Internet
   Protocol) [RFC1385] or IPv7 (also known as TP/IX) [RFC1475].

2.2.2. Fields

   Source Port (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defined and is to be
   used as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC0768].  EUDP
   uses the same port set as UDP.

   Destination Port (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defined and is
   to be used as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC0768]. 
   EUDP uses the same port set as UDP.

   Data Offset (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is the number of 32 bit
   words in the EUDP header.  The EUDP header (even one including
   options) SHALL be an integral number of 32 bits long.

   Options (variable length) - OPIONAL field, that is used to carry EUDP
   options in.  EUDP option are described in Section 2.3.

   Padding (variable length) - OPTIONAL field.  The EUDP header padding
   is used to ensure that the EUDP header ends and data begins on a 32
   bit boundary.  The padding MUST be composed of zeros.

     NOTE: Bits 48-63 are reserved for future use and MUST be ignored by
     EUDP hosts until their use will be properly specified.

INTERNET DRAFT                    EUDP                    April 28, 2011


   EUDP options are placed into the 'Options' header field.  Options may
   occupy space at the end of the EUDP header and are a multiple of 8
   bits in length.  An option may begin on any octet boundary.  There
   are two cases for the format of an option:

     a) a single octet of option-kind.

     b) an octet of option-kind, an octet of option-length, and the
     actual option-data octets.  The option-length counts the two octets
     of option-kind and option-length as well as the option-data octets.

   Note that the list of options MAY be shorter than the data offset
   field might imply.  The content of the header beyond the 'End Of
   Options List' option MUST be header padding (i.e., zero).

   All options fall into two categories: _critical_ and _elective_ . 
   These categories prescribe the host's behavior in the case when it
   receives an unsupported option, as described below.  The even numbers
   of option-kind, including zero, (i. e. 0, 2, 4, 6...) are used to
   identify _critical_ options whereas odd numbers of option-kind
   identify _elective_ options.

   If EUDP host receives the packet with unsupported _critical_ option,
   this packet SHALL be discarded.  If the unknown option is _elective_,
   the receiver of the packet with it MAY continue its processing.

     NOTE: While _critical_ and _elective_ categories are used to ensure
     how the options are processed, they do not describe the support
     criteria for them.  The support of all options is OPTIONAL for EUDP
     hosts.

   Pre-defined options are specified in Section 2.3.2.

2.3.2. Pre-Defined Options

2.3.2.2. 'End Of Options List' Option

   +--------+
   | Kind=2 |

   Figure 3.  'End Of Options List' Option

   This option code indicates the end of the options list.  This might
   not coincide with the end of the EUDP header according to the 'Data
   Offset' header field.  This option SHALL be used at the end of all
   options, not the end of each option, and need only to be used if the
   end of the options would not otherwise coincide with the end of the
   EUDP header.

   The option is _critical_, per Section 2.3.1.

2.3.2.3. 'Echo Request' Option

   | Kind=1 | Length |      Data      |
   +--------+--------+-------//-------+

   Figure 4.  'Echo Request' Option

   The 'Echo Request' option is used to provide the possibility of echo
   debugging using the EUDP.  The option-data octets of option MAY
   consist of arbitrary octets.  The receiver of the packet with this
   option SHALL answer with the packet with 'Echo Response' option (see
   Section 2.3.2.4), if it supports echo debugging via EUDP.

   The option is _elective_, per Section 2.3.1.

   The 'Echo Response' option is put in the packets that are sent in
   response to packets with 'Echo Request' option (see Section 2.3.2.3).
    The packet containing 'Echo Response' option SHALL be send by the
   EUDP host after receiving any EUDP packet with 'Echo Request' option,
   if echo debugging via EUDP is supported by it.  The option-data

   octets of the option MUST be the same as in 'Echo Request' option in
   the received packet.

   The option is _elective_, per Section 2.3.1.

2.3.2.5. 'Packet Identifier' Option

   +--------+--------+--------+-------+
   | Kind=4 |Length=4|    Packet ID   |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------+

   Figure 6.  'Packet Identifier' Option

   The 'Packet Identifier' option is to request the acknowledgment of
   the single separate packet.  The 'Packet ID' field is filled by
   arbitrary bytes by the sender of the packet with this option.  The
   receiver of the packet with 'Packet Identifier' option MUST answer
   with the packet with 'Packet Acknowledgment' option (see Section
   2.3.2.6). See Section 2.5 for details.

   The option is _critical_, per Section 2.3.1.

2.3.2.6. 'Packet Acknowledgment' Option

   +--------+--------+--------+-------+
   | Kind=6 |Length=4| ACK Packet ID  |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------+

   Figure 7.  'Packet Acknowledgment' Option

   The 'Packet Acknowledgment' option is used in the packets that are
   sent in response to the packets with 'Packet Identifier' option.  The
   'ACK Packet ID' field in the option in the packet sent to the
   originating host for packet with 'Packet Identifier' option MUST be
   the same as in the 'Packet Identifier' option-data octets in received
   from this host packet.  See Section 2.5 for details.

   The option is _critical_, per Section 2.3.1.

2.3.2.7. 'Packet Checksum' Option

   calculated using the method described in RFC 768 [RFC0768].  Packets
   containing this option with bad checksum SHOULD be discarded by EUDP
   host, if this option is supported by it.

   The option is _elective_, per Section 2.3.1.

2.4. Pseudo Header

   EUDP does not use pseudo header.

2.5. Packet Delivery Acknowledgment Mechanism

   EUDP provides the possibility to request the acknowledgment of the
   single EUDP packet.  This is provided by 'Packet Identifier' and
   'Packet Acknowledgment' options (see Section 2.3.2.5 and Section
   2.3.2.6, respectively).  In the simplest form, the delivery
   acknowledgment mechanism works as below.

   If EUDP host (let it be A) wants to request the acknowledgment of
   delivery of some packet, it puts the 'Packet Identifier' option in it
   and sends this packet to another EUDP host (let it be B).  Once B
   receives the A's packet, it checks the 'Packet Identifier' option to
   find out the packet identifier.  After it finds it out, this number
   becomes the 'ACK Packet Identifier', that is put into 'Packet
   Acknowledgment' option, which is put into the EUDP packet, and sent
   to A.  The packet identifiers MAY be reused once they are
   acknowledged, since EUDP does provides stateless connection.

   Compared with acknowledgment mechanism of TCP [RFC0793], EUDP
   provides simpler and more liberal system.  While TCP makes using the
   packet sequence numbers and acknowledgement mandatory, EUDP allows
   the host to decide whether the packet needs to be acknowledged by the
   other side or not.

2.6. Compatibility with UDP

   The applications which use UDP can safely use EUDP with no options
   instead.


3.  Security Considerations

   UDP is inheritedly insecure.  It provides neither reliable packet
   delivery nor authentication features.  EUDP without any options does
   not cover these issues as well.  However, the 'Packet Identifier' and
   'Packet Acknowledgment' options (see Section 2.3.2.5 and Section
   2.3.2.6, respectively) introduce the packet delivery acknowledgment
   mechanism, defined in Section 2.5.  Further options may add more

   security features, such as e. g. congestion control, to EUDP.  These
   options are not defined in this document.


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1. 'EUDP Options Numbers' Registry

   IANA is asked to create and maintain the registry named 'EUDP Options
   Numbers Registry' following the guidelines below.

   The registry consists of 4 values: Option Kind, Option Length, Name
   and Reference. They are described below.

     Option Kind - an integer; refers to the value used in EUDP options.
     Values from 0 to 255 are assigned.

     Option Length - an integer, 'variable' (for multi-octet options) or
     'N/A' (for one-octet options).

     Name - contains the name of the option.

     Reference - the reference to the document, that defines the option.

   The initial values are given in Table 1; new assignments are to be
   made following the 'RFC Required' policies. [RFC5226]

   +-------+-------+------------------------------+-----------+
   | Kind  | Length| Name                         | Reference |
   +-------+-------+------------------------------+-----------+
   | 0     | N/A   | No Operation                 | RFC xxxx  |
   | 1     | var.  | Echo Request                 | RFC xxxx  |
   | 2     | N/A   | End Of Options List          | RFC xxxx  |
   | 3     | var.  | Echo Response                | RFC xxxx  |
   | 4     | 4     | Packet Identifier            | RFC xxxx  |
   | 5     | 4     | Packet Checksum              | RFC xxxx  |
   | 6     | 4     | Packet Acknowledgment        | RFC xxxx  |
   | 7-252 | --    | Unassigned                   | RFC xxxx  |
   | 253   | --    | Used for Experimentation     | RFC xxxx  |
   | 254   | --    | Used for Experimentation     | RFC xxxx  |
   | 255   | --    | Reserved                     | RFC xxxx  |

   As EUDP uses the same port set as UDP, IANA is asked to mark the UDP
   port numbers registry values may be used with EUDP as well. 

4.3. IP Protocol Number Assignment

   IANA has assigned the IP protocol number TBD1 to be used with EUDP.

INTERNET DRAFT    'Informational' Class for IP Options  November 8, 2010


1  Introduction

   Sometimes it is needed to allocate some information in an IPv4
   option. While developing the specification of such an option,
   developers prefer to use 'debugging and measurement' class. It is not
   correct. That is why a specific class should be allocated for
   informational options. This document specifies such a class named
   'Informational'

1.1  Terminology

   IPv4 refers to the Internet Protocol defined in [RFC791]

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Overview

   This document specifies an 'Informational' class for IPv4 options.
   The class SHOULD be used for options that carry any kind of
   information. The options which are intended to be assigned as
   'Informational' MUST be assigned through IANA. 

   This document updates [RFC791] in the part of options classes so that
   the class 2 takes 'informational' value.

3  Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in this document.


4  IANA Considerations

   Allocation terms of 'Informational' class options remain the same as
   for existing classes.

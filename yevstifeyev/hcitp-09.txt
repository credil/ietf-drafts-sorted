INTERNET DRAFT                 HCITP v0.9              December 17, 2010


1. Introduction

   The protocol, defined by this document - HCITP, is used to provide
   possibility to request and transfer the information about hardware
   configuration and can occasionally be used for requesting information
   about OS.

   The main purpose of defined protocol is to provide the auxiliary
   service (in addition to some sort of 'major' protocol, such as HTTP
   or FTP), which will allow the server to check its client's hardware
   so that it would get known if the service it provides is appropriate
   for it. For instance, some HTTP server (let it be A) is going to
   transfer to its client (let it be B) some software, which requires
   special hardware or its configuration. So A sends HCITP request to B
   to check the configuration of B's hardware. When it receives answer
   it may continue transferring the information or warn the client that
   the information is not appropriate for it. Nevertheless client may
   choose to download it or not.

   Another way it can be used is controlling large networks, where some
   kind of hardware may be added but needs to be controlled.

   This document defined he preliminary version of HCITP - HCITP/0.9.
   Note that the protocol is Experimental and intended to be in Limited
   Use while experimenting. The final version - 1.0 - will include many
   issues not discussed by this document.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation and core rules of [RFC5234]. The construction <n>#<m>element
   is used as defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616].

    Picture 1. The interaction of protocols.

2.2. Functional Description

   HCITP is used to request and transfer information about hardware 
   configuration of the computer.

   HCITP uses TCP a as a lower level protocol.

   TCP-based HCITP uses text commands and response codes to exchange
   information. HCITP commands and response codes are defined in Section
   3.2.

2.3. Model of Work

   HCITP is a client-server protocol. Each computer can be as server, as
   client. A computer which requests information is a client. A computer
   which answers the client is a server.

   The server listens a TCP port TBD1 for incoming TCP connections. As
   soon as TCP connection is established, nodes begin to exchange
   commands and answers.  A server closes a transaction if a client sent
   a corresponding command or the server hasn't received the commands
   for a definite period of time.

   While processing request some errors may occur. In this case a server

   SHOULD send an Error Response (ER). After receiving ER a client MAY
   repeat the request.

   If the information is requested about the device which is not present
   in the server's system, it SHOULD send ER with the corresponding
   error code. In that case a client shouldn't repeat the request.

INTERNET DRAFT                 HCITP v0.9              December 17, 2010


   The following commands MUST be supported by all HCITP nodes.

   HCITP commands:
   OPE - is used to open the HCITP connection. The syntax is given
   below.
       ope_command = "OPE" SP timeout
       timeout     = 1*3DIGIT ;connection timeout in seconds
   REQ - is used to request the information about device. The syntax is
   given below. 
       req_command = "REQ" SP device_code
       device_code = 1*3DIGIT ;see Section 3.3
   ACK - acknowledgment of received information - is used to sure that
   the client has received the information. Refers to the latest answer.
   The syntax is given below. SHOULD be sent after each server response
   with codes 200, 402 and 404 (see Section 3.2.3).
       ack_command = "ACK"

   The reaction of server is described below (see Section 3.2.4 )

3.2.2. Server Response Codes

   This section describes the codes which are used by servers to answer
   the commands.

   The general syntax of HCITP Response is:
   hcitp_response       = response_code [SP response_information]
   response_code        = 3DIGIT ;see description below
   response_information = token  ;the information which concerns the
                                 ;answer

   <command_information> part of Response MAY be as REQUIRED as
   OPTIONAL, depending on the code.

   syntax is given below.
       conn_cl_response            = "202" [SP response_information]
   400 - HCITP not used. Used to answer the OPE command. The syntax is
   given below.
       hcitp_not_used_response     = "400" [SP response_information]  
   401 - HCITP not allowed to be used. Used to answer the OPE command.
   The syntax is given below.
       hcitp_not_allowed_response  = "401" [SP response_information]
   402 - Information about the requested device is not allowed to be
   transferred. Used to answer the REQ command. The syntax is given
   below.
       device_not_allowed_response = "402" [SP response_information]
   403 - TCP-based HCITP not used. Used to answer the OPE command. The
   syntax is given below.
       tcp_hcitp_not_used_response = "403" [SP response_information]
   404 - Information is requested about absent device. Used to answer
   the REQ command. The syntax is given below.
       device_absent_response      = "404" [SP response_information]
   405 - Wrong command. Used to answer the unknown command (not listed
   in Section 3.2.2). The syntax is given below.
       wrong_command_response      = "405" [SP response_information]

3.2.3. The Reaction of Server

   This section defines a reaction of server to the commands (see
   Section 3.2.2) and other events.

   If a server receives an 'OPE' command, it can send 201, 400, 401 or
   403 codes. Code 201 is sent if server is able to open a connection.
   In this case it opens a connection with a corresponding timeout value
   (defined in command option). If HCITP is not used, it sends a code
   400 and closes the TCP connection. If HCITP is not allowed to be
   used, the server sends 401 code and closes TCP connection. If TCP-
   based HCITP is not supported, the server sends code 403 and closes
   TCP connection.

   If a server receives 'REQ' command, it can send 200, 402 or 404
   codes. Code 200 is sent with an 'Information' part containing
   information about the requested device (defined in the command
   option). (See Section 3.5 for device numbers.) In this case the
   server keeps the TCP connection alive. Code 402 is sent if the
   information about requested device is not allowed to be transferred.
   In this case the server keeps the TCP connection alive. Code 404 is
   sent if the information is requested about the device, which is not
   present in the client's system. In this case the server keeps the TCP
   connection alive.

   If a server receives the 'ACK' command, it continues to listen for

   other commands. No response is sent.

   If a server doesn't receive the 'ACK' command after sending the
   response, it MAY try to repeat the answer. If an ACK command haven't
   been received during the timeout value, server closes TCP connection
   without sending any codes.

   If a server receives the 'INF' command, it sends 200 code followed
   with an information about the transaction. The 'Information' part of
   this response syntax is arbitrary.

   If a server receives the 'RST' command, it closes the TCP connection
   without sending any response codes.

   If a server receives the 'CLS' command, it SHOULD send 202 command
   and close the TCP connection.

   If a server haven't received any commands during the timeout value
   time, it closes TCP connection without sending any response codes.

4.  Security Considerations

   HCITP itself does not provide any security possibilities. It is
   considered that it may be used to find out vulnerable systems via
   receiving information about vulnerable OS version etc. Because of
   this all HCITP implementations SHOULD support ACL (access control
   lists), which would allow or restrict transferring information about
   definite device or to definite destination. 

   HCITP does not provide any authentication or encryption services.
   These issues are intended to be added to the final version of HCITP.

   Moreover, HCITP nodes SHOULD NOT open more than 256 connections at
   the same time. This restriction will make DDoS-like attacks through
   HCITP impossible.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1. Port Assignment

   IANA has assigned the TCP port number TBD1 to be used with HCITP.

5.2. Devices Numbers Registry

   IANA has created the registry called 'HCITP Devices Numbers', which
   consists of following values: Number, Device Name, Reference. Initial
   values are given below; new assignments for numbers 17-254 are to be
   made trough Expert Review, for numbers 257-9999 - following the First
   Came - First Served policies; the syntax rule fors information about
   registered device MUST be provided for registration.

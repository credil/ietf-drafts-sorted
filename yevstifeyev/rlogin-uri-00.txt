1.  Introduction

   The Rlogin protocol was firstly defined in RFC 1258 [RFC1258], that
   has been made obsolete by RFC 1282 [RFC1282].  This protocol is used
   for access to remote Unix terminal; in fact it provides the same
   service as Telnet protocol [RFC854].

   This document specifies the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme
   for access to the resources, available via this protocol - 'rlogin'
   URI scheme.

   Generic URI syntax is defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]; registration
   procedures for new URI schemes are described in RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

INTERNET DRAFT            'rlogin' URI scheme           February 2, 2011


2.  Scheme Definition 

   The 'rlogin' URI scheme is used to access the resources available via
   Rlogin protocol [RFC1282].  This scheme support only Rlogin over TCP,
   as described in its original specification; Rlogin over SSH, TLS,
   etc. are not provided by this URI scheme.

   The 'rlogin' URI takes the following form (described in Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]):

     rlogin-uri = "rlogin:" hier-part
     hier-part  = "//" host [":" port] ["/"]

   The rules 'host' and 'port' are defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  If
   the 'port' is omitted, it SHALL default to 513.  The final character
   "/" MAY be omitted.

3.  Security Considerations

   The Rlogin protocol uses ACLs (access control lists) to control the
   access to the terminals.  It does not provide any authentification
   features, that may be provided in the next versions of the protocol.

   The 'rlogin' URI scheme designates the access to resources, available
   by Rlogin over TCP, but does not support more secure Rlogin over SSH,
   TLS, etc.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'rlogin' URI scheme using the following
   template (see RFC 4395 [RFC4395]):

     URI scheme name: rlogin

     Status: Permanent

     URI scheme syntax: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme semantics: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme encoding considerations: generic encoding considerations
     for URI schemes, defined in Section 2 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986],
     concern 'rlogin' one as well.  Non-ASCII characters are to be
     mapped as defined in Section 3.1 of RFC 3987 [RFC3987]

     Protocols that use the scheme: Rlogin protocol [RFC1282]

     Security considerations: see Section 3 of RFC xxxx

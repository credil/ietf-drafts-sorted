                        The 'tn3270' URI Scheme 
                   <draft-yevstifeyev-tn3270-uri-18>

Abstract

   This document is the specification of the 'tn3270' Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) scheme, which is used to designate the access to the
   resources available via Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) and Telnet 3270
   Enchanted mode (TN3270E).  It updates RFC 1041 and RFC 2355, which
   specify these protocols, and RFC 1738, which firstly mentioned this
   URI scheme without defining its syntax and semantics.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the 'tn3270' Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) scheme, which is used to designate the access to the resources
   available via Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270), as described in RFC 1041
   [RFC1041] (especially, see Section 4 of RFC 1041; visit RFC 1576
   [RFC1576] for TN3270 practices), and Telnet 3270 Enchanted mode
   (TN3270E), as described in RFC 2355 [RFC2355].

   The 'tn3270' URI scheme was firstly mentioned in RFC 1738 [RFC1738]
   as used in URIs that designate the access to "Interactive 3270
   emulation sessions".  Following the creation of the URI scheme
   registries per RFC 4395 [RFC4395], this scheme was added to the
   "Provisional URI Schemes" sub-registry in the "Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) Schemes" IANA registry [URIREG].  However RFC 1738
   [RFC1738] does not give any definition of syntax and semantics of the
   'tn3270' URIs and does not have any guidelines for registration of
   this scheme.

   Since there is no acceptable specification of 'tn3270' URI, there is
   a risk that somebody might try to implement it with some new,
   possibly undocumented, syntax, just by looking at IANA registry.  In
   order to minimize such risk, this document gives precise definition
   of syntax, semantics and use of this URIs and registers the
   corresponding scheme.  It also updates RFC 2355 [RFC2355], RFC 1738

INTERNET DRAFT            'tn3270' URI Scheme              April 6, 2011


   [RFC1738] and RFC 1041 [RFC1041].

   The generic syntax of URIs is described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. 
   Registration procedures for new URI schemes are defined in RFC 4395
   [RFC4395].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  'tn3270' URI Definition

   The 'tn3270' URI is used to access services which are available via
   Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270), as described in RFC 1041 [RFC1041], and
   Telnet 3270 Enchanted mode (TN3270E), as described in RFC 2355
   [RFC2355].  In fact these protocols are a modified form of Telnet
   [RFC0854]; see their specifications for details.

   Note: This document does not specify the TN3270 and TN3270E 
         services themselves, but only the URI scheme for them.

   There already is the 'telnet' URI scheme [RFC4248], which designates
   the access to resources available via usual Telnet [RFC0854].  The
   syntax of 'tn3270' URI is similar to that of 'telnet' one (except the
   <scheme> part) and takes the form of <tn3270-uri> rule below (given
   in ABNF, as described in RFC 5234 [RFC5234]):

   tn3270-uri       = "tn3270:" "//" authority ["/"]
                      ;the 'tn3270' URI takes the form
                      ;tn3270://<userinfo>@<host>:<port>/
                      ;that is formally defined via the <authority>

   The <authority> rule is specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  If <port>
   (in the <authority>) is omitted, it SHALL default to 21, as
   registered in [PORTREG].  The final character "/" MAY be omitted. 
   The <userinfo> (in the <authority>) is assumed to provide information
   for authentication using RFC 2941 [RFC2941] Telnet Authentication
   option.


3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of [RFC3986].

INTERNET DRAFT            'tn3270' URI Scheme              April 6, 2011


   Since 'tn3270' URIs provide access to services that are available via
   TN3270 and TN3270E, which do not add any new security issues to
   Telnet session, as they are a modified form of it, there are no other
   security considerations for 'tn3270' URIs not discussed in RFC 4248
   [RFC4248] - the 'telnet' URI scheme specification.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update the registration of the 'tn3270' URI scheme
   using the following registration template (see [RFC4395]):

     URI scheme name: tn3270

     Status: Permanent

     URI scheme syntax: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme semantics: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme encoding considerations: there are no other encoding
     considerations for 'tn3270' URIs not described in RFC 3986
     [RFC3986]

     Protocols that use the scheme: Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) [RFC1041]
     and Telnet 3270 Enchanted Mode (TN3270E) [RFC2355]

     Security considerations: see Section 3 of RFC xxxx

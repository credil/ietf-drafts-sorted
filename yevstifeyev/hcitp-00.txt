1 Introduction

  Many protocols of the Internet are used to transfer large amount of
  information which can be displayed at the receiver's computer only if
  required hardware is present or its configuration allow to do this.

  Now if the receiver is not able to display the information, this
  information is being sent. This causes the overload of the network.
  Using HCITP will solve this problem by preceding transfer of
  information about hardware configuration of the client.
  
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
  this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2 Functional Description

  HCITP is used to request and transfer information about hardware
  configuration of the computer.

  HCITP supports TCP as well as UDP as a lower level protocol.
  Every HCITP node MUST support TCP-based HCITP, but its use
  is OPTIONAL. TCP-based HCITP is RECOMMENDED for common use.

Internet-Draft                   HCITP                  October 30, 2010

  TCP-based HCITP uses text commands and response codes to
  exchange information. HCITP commands and response codes are
  defined in Section 3.2.

  UDP-based HCITP use packets to exchange information. Packets 
  consist of header and body. The format of packets is described
  in this document (see Section 3.3).

  Each node mustn't open more than 256 connection
  at the same time.

2.3 Modes of Work
  
  TCP-based HCITP has no modes of work.
  
  UDP-based HCITP has 3 modes of work:
   a) casual. If HCITP works in this mode, it just transfers the
  information about hardware configuration.
   b) "If has". This mode allows to get known the fact of presence
  of a device.
   c) trace. This mode is similar to ICMP Echo messages and is used
  to check the availability of using HCITP.

  These modes will be described below more detailed.

2.4 Model of Work

  HCITP is a client-server protocol. Each computer can be as server,
  as client. A computer which requests information is a client.
  A computer which answers the client is a server.
  
  Models of work of TCP-based and UDP-based HCITP are different.
  
  If a server uses TCP-based HCITP (see Section 3.2), it listens a 
  TCP port XXXX for incoming TCP connections. As soon as TCP connection
  is estabilished, nodes begin to exchange commands and answers. 
  A server closes a trnsaction if a client sent a corresponding command
  or the server hasn't received the commands for a defenite period 
  of time.

  If a server uses UDP-based HCITP (see Section 3.3), it listens the 
  UDP port XXXX. After a server receives the HCITP request, it forms
  an answer and sends it to a client. Then a client should send Thank
  You Message (TUM) in order a server close a transaction.

  While processing request some errors may occur. In this case a
  server should send an Error Response (ER). After receiving ER
  a client may repeat the request.

  If the information is requested about the device which is not
  present in the server's system, it should send ER with the
  corresponding error code. In that case a client shouldn't repeat the
  request.

  HCITP trace messages (UDP-based HCITP) can be used like ICMP Echo
  messages. Generally they are used to check if HCITP can be used.
  The text of body in HCITP trace request must be similar to the text
  in HCITP trace answer.

3.2.2 Client Commands

  This section defines client commands which are used
  with HCITP.  
  
  Commands are used by clients to request a defenite information
  or send any information to the server (e. g. openning the connection)
  
  The general scheme of HCITP command is:
  +---------+-+----------
  | Command | | Options
  +---------+-+----------
              \
             space
  
  'Options' part in th command MAY be as obligatory as OPTIONAL,
  depending on the command.
  
  The following commands MUST be supported by all HCITP nodes.
  
  HCITP commands:
   OPE - is used to open the HCITP connection. Has an option
  'Connection Timeout' (in sec.) (up to 3 characters; integer -
  from 1 to 128). Can be used only in CLOSED state.
   REQ - is used to request the information about device. Should
  be followed with the number of device (up to 3 characters; integer - 
  from 0 to 255) (see Section ). Can be used only in OPEN state.
   ACK - acknowledgment of received information - is used to
  shoe that the client has received the information. Refers to
  the latest answer. Has no options. Should be sent after each
  server response with codes 200, 402 and 404.
   INF - is used to request the information about the transaction.
  Has no options.
   RST - is used to reset the connection. Has no actions.
   CLS - is used to close the transaction. Has no options.
   
  The reaction of server is described below (see Section )

Internet-Draft                   HCITP                  October 30, 2010  	
  
  The 'Information' part of Response MAY be as obligatory
  as OPTIONAL, depending on the code.
  
  HCITP response codes:
   200 - OK. IS used to answer the REQ and INF commands. The 
  'Information' part MUST be present in this response.
   201 - Connection opened. Is used to answer the OPE command.
  'Information' part is OPTIONAL.
   202 - Connection closed. Is used to answer the CLS command.
  'Information' part is OPTIONAL.
   400 - HCITP not used. Used to answer the OPE command.
  'Information' part is OPTIONAL.   
   401 - HCITP not allowed to be used. Used to answer the OPE command.
  'Information' part is OPTIONAL.
   402 - Information about the requested device is not allowed 
   to be transferred. Used to answer the REQ command.
  'Information' part is OPTIONAL.
   403 - TCP-based HCITP not used. Used to answer the OPE command.
  'Information' part is OPTIONAL.
   404 - Information is requested about absent device.
  Used to answer the REQ command. 'Information' part is OPTIONAL.
   405 - Wrong command. Used to answer the unknown command
  (not listed in Section 3.2.2). 'Information' part is OPTIONAL.
  
3.2.4 The Reaction of Server

  This section defines a reaction of server to the commands 
  (see Section 3.2.2) and other events.

  If a server receives an 'OPE' command, it can send 201, 400, 401 
  or 403 codes. Code 201 is sent if server is able to open a connection.
  In this case it opens a connection with a corresponding timeout value
  (defined in command option). If HCITP is not used, it sends a code 400 
  and closes the TCP connection. If HCITP is not allowed to be used, the 
  server sends 401 code and closes TCP connection. If TCP-based HCITP is 
  not supported, the server sends code 403 and closes TCP connection.
  
  If a server receives 'REQ' command, it can send 200, 402 or 404 codes.
  Code 200 is sent with an 'Information' part containing information 
  about the requested device (defined in the command option). 
  (See Section for device numbers.) In this case the server keeps 
  the TCP connection alive. Code 402 is sent if the information about 
  requested device is not allowed to be transferred. In this case the
  server keeps the TCP connection alive. Code 404 is sent if the 
  information is requested about the device, which is not present in 
  the client's system. In this case the server keeps the TCP connection
  alive.
  
  If a server receives the 'ACK' command, it continues to listen for 
  other commands. No response is sent.

Internet-Draft                   HCITP                  October 30, 2010  
  
  If a server doesn't receive the 'ACK' command after sending the
  response, it MAY  try to repeate the answer. If an ACK command 
  haven't been received during the timeout value, server closes
  TCP connection without sending any codes.
  
  If a server receives the 'INF' command, it sends 200 code followed
  with an information about the transation. The 'Information' part 
  of this response syntax is arbitrary.

  If a server receives the 'RST' command, it closes the TCP connection
  without sending any response codes.

  If a server receives the 'CLS' command, it should send 202 command and
  close the TCP connection.
  
  If a server haven't received any commands during the timeout 
  value time, it closes TCP connection without sending any response
  codes.

3.5 Device Numbers to Be Used with HCITP 

  This section defines devices, which can be used to transfer
  information about and their number to be used in HCITP packets
  and commands.
  
  The first values is decimal (used in TCP-based HCITP) and the
  second is binary (used in UDP-based HCITP).
  
  0, 00000 - used for Trace MSGs and TUMs (UDP-based HCITP);
  1, 00001 - processor information;
  2, 00010 - RAM information;
  3, 00011 - motherboard information;
  4, 00100 - Hard drive information;
  5, 00101 - Network interface card information;
  6, 00110 - VGA information;
  7, 00111 - Sound Card information;
  8, 01000 - CD drive information;

  9, 01001 - floppy drive information;
  10, 01010 - monitor information;
  11, 01011 - printer information;
  12, 01100 - scanner information;
  13, 01101 - web-camera information;
  14, 01110 - mouse information;
  15, 01111 - keyboard information;
  16, 10000 - OS information;
  17-31, 10001-11111 - not used.
  
3.6 Error Messages Formation for UDP-based HCITP

  This section defines the rules for formation the error
  responses in UDP-based HCITP.

  If an error occurs while processing the request or a device
  is not present, the server should send the Error Response (ER).
  It is done by setting AT in 10 and putting the error code into
  the body of the packet.

  Error codes are similar to that in TCP-based HCITP. See Section 3.2.3
  for details.

4 IANA Considerations
  
  IANA should assign TCP and UDP ports number and Protocol Number 
  to be used by HCITP. The coresponding application has been made and
  at the moment it is being processing.
  
5 Security Considerations

  HCITP, as mentioned before, supports only 256 connection at the same
  time on one of the side of exchange. It won't make possible DDoS
  attacks using HCITP.

  We consider that formation of HCITP answers is laborious task. That
  is why we make the restriction, mentioned in previous paragraph.

  It is considered that some information can be used for hacker goals.
  That is why each HCITP client should support ACL (access control
  lists) which can allow or restrict transferring some kinds of 
  information.

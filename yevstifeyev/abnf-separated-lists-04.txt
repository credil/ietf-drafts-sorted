INTERNET DRAFT     ABNF Notation for Separated Lists   December 16, 2010


1.  Introduction

   ABNF does not provide the possibility to express the separated lists
   of elements via specific construction. If it is needed (generally for
   defining HTTP headers or human-readable forms), the following ABNF
   construction is used:

   (*LWS element n*m(*LWS separator *LWS element))

   It is obvious that this construction is too simplified and bulky.
   This document specifies universal ABNF notation for lists, separated
   by arbitrary specified characters.

1.1.  Conventions

   This document uses ABNF notation and core rules defined in RFC 5234
   [RFC5234]. The construction in {} is used for expressing arithmetic
   expressions. For instance, if a=2, b=3 and c={b-a}, c is 1. If the
   result after using the {} construction is less then zero, it MUST be
   treated as zero, if not mentioned another. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Notation Description

   This document augment the ABNF notation <n>*<m>element with OPTIONAL
   separator part, so that the construction for separated lists is:

   <n>*<m>[#(<a>)]element

   where <a> is a separator. This construction indicates at least <n>
   and at most <m> elements separated by <a>.

   The corresponding construction <n>element is also updated so that for
   separated lists it stands as:

   <n>[#(<a>)]element

   indicating exactly <n> elements separated by <a>.

   The ABNF for this construction is:

   n*m#(a)(element) = (n_1*m_1(element 1*SP a) f(element)) 
   n#(a)(element)   = (n_1(element 1*SP a) element)
   n               = *DIGIT        ;the minimum amount of elements
   m               = *DIGIT        ;the maximum amount of elements
   n_1             = {n-1}
   n_1             =/ *DIGIT
   m_1             = {m-1}
   m_1             =/ *DIGIT
   u               = <the number of used elements>
   f               = {u-(u-1)}
   f               =/ 1*DIGIT      ;will be 0 if no elements are used
                                   ;and 1 if at least one is used

   <n> MAY be omitted indicating that any amount of elements not more
   than <m> is allowed (including zero). In this case <n_1> is to be
   omitted too.

   <m> MAY be omitted indicating that any amount of elements not less
   than <n> is allowed (including <n>). In this case <m_1> is to be
   omitted too.

   <n> and <m> MAY be omitted indicating that any amount of elements is
   allowed (including zero). In this case <m_1> and <n_1> are to be
   omitted too.

2.1. Examples

   The section contains a few examples of using the defined
   construction.

   1*3#(";")element indicates the list of elements separated by
   semicolons (";") and OPTIONAL spaces which consists of at least 1 and
   at most 3 elements.

   1*#(SP)element indicates the list of elements separated by spaces and
   OPTIONAL spaces which consists of any amount of elements but not less
   than 1.

   *3#(",")element indicates the list of elements separated by commas
   (",") and OPTIONAL spaces which consists of any amount of elements
   but not more than 3 (including zero).

   *#("-")element indicates the list of elements separated by hyphens
   ("-") and OPTIONAL spaces which consists of any amount of elements
   (including zero). 

   *#(SP "." SP)element indicates the list of elements separated be the
   following sequence of characters: space-point-space and OPTIONAL
   spaces which consists of any amount of elements (including zero).

   1*#(";" / ":")element indicates the list of elements separated by
   colons or semicolons which consists of at least 1 element.

   2#(SP)element indicates the list of two elements separated by spaces.

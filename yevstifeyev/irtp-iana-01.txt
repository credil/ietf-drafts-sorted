   Internet Reliable Transaction Protocol (IRTP) IANA Considerations
                    <draft-yevstifeyev-irtp-iana-01>

Abstract

   This document defined IANA considerations for Internet Reliable
   Transaction Protocol (IRTP). This protocol uses several values that
   are to be assigned by IANA, but no appropriate registries have been
   created so far. This document serves as a foundation for such
   registries. It updates RFC 938.

INTERNET DRAFT          IRTP IANA Considerations       December 28, 2010


1.  Introduction

   Internet Reliable Transaction Protocol (IRTP) was originally defined
   in RFC 938 [RFC938]. This protocol uses several values that are to be
   assigned by IANA (such as port numbers or packet types), but no
   appropriate registries have been created so far. This document serves
   as a foundation for such registries.

2.  'IRTP Packet Types' Registry

2.1. The Name of the Registry

   The name of created registry is 'IRTP Packet Types'.

2.2. The Format of the Registry

   The 'IRTP Packet Types' registry consists of 3 values: Packet Type
   Number, Description and Reference. They are described below:

     Packet Type Number - an integer; refers to the value used in IRTP
     header. Values form 0 to 255 are assigned.

     Description - a brief decryption of packet type.

     Reference - the reference document, that defines the packet type.

2.3. Registration Procedures

   New assignments to 'IRTP Packet Types' registry are to be made
   following the 'IETF Consensus' policies [RFC5226].

2.4. The Initial Contents of the Registry

   This section contains the initial contents of the 'IRTP Packet Types'
   registry.

   +--------+-------------------------------------+-----------+

   |1       | SYNCH ACK                           | RFC 938   |
   |2       | DATA                                | RFC 938   |
   |3       | DATA ACK                            | RFC 938   |
   |4       | PORT NAK                            | RFC 938   |
   |5-253   | Unassigned                          | RFC xxxx  |
   |254     | Used for Experimentation            | RFC xxxx  |
   |255     | Reserved                            | RFC xxxx  |
   +--------+-------------------------------------+-----------+
   [RFC Editor: Replace xxxx with assigned RFC number]

2.5. Sub-Registries

   No sub-registries are currently defined in 'IRTP Packet Types'
   registry.

   The name of created registry is 'IRTP Port Numbers'.

3.2. The Format of the Registry

   The 'IRTP Port Numbers' registry consists of 3 values: Port Number,
   Description and Reference. They are described below:

     Port Number - an integer; refers to the value used in IRTP header.
     Values form 0 to 255 are assigned.

     Description - a brief decryption of port usage.

     Reference or Registrant Information - the reference document, that
     defines the port usage or information about the registrant of the
     port number.

3.3. Registration Procedures

   New assignments to 'IRTP Port Numbers' registry are to be made
   following the 'IESG Approval' policies [RFC5226].

4.  Security Considerations

   The creation of these registries is not believed to introduce any new
   security issues to IRTP not discussed in RFC 938 [RFC938].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the IP Protocol Number 23 to IRTP.

   IANA has created the 'IRTP Packet Types' and 'IRTP Port Numbers'
   registries following Section 2 and Section 3 of this document.

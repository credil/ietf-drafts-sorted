Abstract 
    
   EAP-TTLS is an EAP method that provides secured authentication as 
   described in RFC 5281. This method makes generally use of two phases 
   in order to complete authentication. The first one consists in the 
   authentication of the TTLS server to the client, established by a 
   TLS handshake between the client and the TTLS server. The handshake 
   may be either mutual or one-way. The authentication of the client to 
   the server may then be negotiated during phase two of EAP-TTLS, 
   thanks to widely-deployed authentication mechanisms such as CHAP, 
   PAP, MS-CHAP or MS-CHAP-V2. 
    
   The purpose of EAP-BIO is to define how to use a biometric 
   authentication mechanism during phase two of EAP-TTLS. This 
   authentication mechanism ranges from physiological characteristics 
   such as fingerprint identification, to behavioral characteristics 
   such as voice or signature analysis. Hence, EAP-BIO combines the 
   security features of EAP-TTLS and biometric authentication.

1 Overview 
    
   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC 3748] defines a 
   standard message exchange that allows a server to authenticate a 
   client using an authentication method agreed upon by both parties. 
   EAP may be extended with additional authentication methods by 
   registering such methods with IANA or by defining vendor specific 
   methods. 
    
   EAP Tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS) [RFC 5281] defines an authentication 
   protocol performing mutual authentication between the client and the 
   server. This authentication can be directly negotiated during the 
   TLS handshake if the client uses a certificate, but contrary to EAP-
   TLS such a configuration is not required from the client. If the 
   client cannot authenticate to the server with a certificate, then 
   the TLS handshake is used as a first phase allowing the client and 
   the server to implicitly generate keying material in order to create 
   a secure tunnel where the following data are to be transferred. The 
   second phase of EAP-TTLS allows the client to securely authenticate 
   to the server using common protocols such as CHAP, PAP, MS-CHAP or 
   MS-CHAP-V2. Nevertheless, any authentication protocol, such as 
   biometric mechanisms, may be defined. 
    
   Biometric authentication involves the use of physical and/or 
   behavioural characteristics of individuals to identify them and to 
   control access to places or things, such as computerized equipment, 
   or more specifically, applications running on that equipment. 
   Biometrics has some advantages over more conventional authentication 
   techniques (login and password, PIN codes, etc.) since nothing has 
   to be carried or remembered that might be stolen. Among the many 
   biometric technologies in use are fingerprint analysis, hand 
   geometry analysis, retina scanning, iris scanning, signature 
   analysis, facial recognition, keystroke analysis, and voice 
   analysis. 
    
   Based on original measurement of a biometric characteristic (i.e. 
   enrolment), a person's identity can thereafter be verified 
   automatically when requesting access to a computer application or to 
   any other resource by re-sampling the characteristic and comparing 
   the biometric data with the enrolment. If a sufficiently close match 
   is found, then the identity is verified. 
    
   However, the time needed for biometric comparisons with samples in 
   database is much longer than the time required for more widely-
   deployed authentication mechanisms. Thus, the protocol MUST ask a 
   login from the user before processing its biometric characteristic. 
   Such an implementation will significantly reduce the time required 
   for the authentication since the server only needs to compare the 
   biometric characteristic with one sample from the database.

2 Terminology 
    
   AAA 
    
   Authentication, Authorization and Accounting - functions that are 
   generally required to control access to a network and support 
   billing and auditing. 
    
   AAA protocol 
    
   A network protocol used to communicate with AAA servers; examples 
   include RADIUS and Diameter. 
    
   AAA server 
    
   A server which performs one or more AAA functions: authenticating a 
   user prior to granting network service, providing authorization 
   (policy) information governing the type of network service the user 
   is to be granted, and accumulating accounting information about 
   actual usage. 
    
   AAA/H 
    
   A AAA server in the user's home domain, where authentication and 
   authorization for that user are administered. 
    
   Access Point 
    
   A network device providing users with a point of entry into the 
   network, and which may enforce access control and policy based on 
   information returned by a AAA server. Since the access point 
   terminates the server side of the EAP conversation, for the purposes 
   of this document it is therefore equivalent to the "authenticator" 
   as used in the EAP specification [RFC 3748]. 
   Since the access point acts as a client to a AAA server, for the 
   purposes of this document it is therefore also equivalent to the 
   "NAS", as used in AAA specifications such as [RFC 2865]. 
    
   Access Domain 
    
   The domain, including access points and other devices, that provides 
   users with an initial point of entry into the network; for example, 
   a wireless hot spot. 
    
   Client 
    
   A host or device that connects to a network through an access point; 
   since it terminates the client side of the EAP conversation, for the 
   purposes of this document, it is therefore equivalent to the "peer", 
   as used in the EAP specification [RFC 3748]. 

    
   Urien & All        Informational - Expires April 2010      [Page 5] 

 
    
   Domain 
    
   A network and associated devices that are under the administrative 
   control of an entity such as a service provider or the user's home 
   organization. 
    
   Minutia 
    
   A generic term in biometrics that designates specific points in a 
   fingerprint record such as ridge bifurcations or endpoints. 
    
   TTLS server 
    
   A AAA server which implements EAP-TTLS. This server may also be 
   capable of performing user authentication, or it may proxy the user 
   authentication to a AAA/H. 
    
   User 
    
   The person operating the client device; though the line is often 
   blurred, "user" is intended to refer to the human being who is 
   possessed of an identity (username), password or other 
   authenticating information, and "client" is intended to refer to the 
   device which makes use of this information to negotiate network 
   access. There may also be clients with no human operators; in this 
   case the term "user" is a convenient abstraction.

   The architecture depicted above only displays the general 
   organization for message transmission, which means that additional 
   security features are not visible. An overview of the security 
   offered by this architecture will be described below. 
    
3.1 Carrier Protocols 
    
   As explained in RFC 5281, the entities shown above, except the 
   biometric reader and the client, communicate with each other using 
   carrier protocols capable of encapsulating EAP. The client and the 
   access point communicate typically using a link layer carrier 
   protocol such as PPP or EAPOL. The access point, TTLS server and 
   AAA/H server communicate using a AAA carrier protocol such as RADIUS 
   or Diameter. 
    
   EAP, and therefore EAP-TTLS, must be initiated via the carrier 
   protocol between the client and the access point. In PPP or EAPOL, 
   for example, EAP is initiated when the access point sends an EAP-
   Request/Identity packet to the client. 
    
   The keying material used to encrypt and authenticate the data 
   connection between the client and the access point is developed 
   implicitly between the client and TTLS server as a result of EAP- 
   TTLS negotiation. This keying material must be communicated to the 
   access point by the TTLS server using the AAA carrier protocol. 
    
3.2 Security overview 
    
   The architecture inherits all the security features of EAP-TTLS, and 
   as such allows secure authentication between the client and the TTLS 
   server. However, the biometric elements have to be implemented with 
   proper security in order not to compromise the whole new 
   authentication protocol. 
    
   Some of the potential attacks related to biometrics may indeed 
   compromise the security of the protocol and may result in 
   unauthorized access: 
   - If the user gives a false sample to the biometric reader (false 
   finger, mask, eye picture), the reader may grant access according to 
   the false credentials it was given. 
    
   - If the user manages to send previously acquired samples from 
   another user, the protocol may grant access if it has no protection 
   against replay attacks. 
    
   These are two potential attacks that are not covered by the security 
   offered by EAP-TTLS. The security features addressing these flaws 
   mainly rely on smart cards and digital signatures, and will be 
   discussed in later sections.

4 EAP-BIO Overview 
    
   Since EAP-BIO relies on EAP-TTLS, the authentication process is the 
   same as EAP-TTLS protocol. It consists of two phases, where phase 1 
   is a TLS handshake that either performs mutual authentication, or 
   authenticates the TTLS server to the client and allows a secure 
   tunnel to be created, in which authentication data and other 
   significant information will be exchanged during phase 2 of the 
   protocol. 
    
4.1 Phase 1: Handshake 
    
   In phase 1, the TLS handshake protocol is used to authenticate the 
   TTLS server to the client and, optionally, to authenticate the 
   client to the TTLS server. 
    
   The TTLS server initiates the EAP-TTLS method with an EAP-TTLS/Start 
   packet, which is an EAP-Request with Type = EAP-TTLS and the S 
   (Start) bit set. This indicates to the client that it should begin 
   TLS handshake by sending a ClientHello message. 
    
   EAP packets continue to be exchanged between client and TTLS server 
   to complete the TLS handshake, as described in [RFC 5216]. Phase 1 
   is completed when the client and the TTLS server exchange 
   ChangeCipherSpec and Finished messages. At this point, additional 
   information may be securely tunnelled. 
    
   As part of the TLS handshake protocol, the TTLS server will send its 
   certificate along with a chain of certificates leading to the 
   certificate of a trusted CA. The client will need to be configured 
   with the certificate of the trusted CA in order to perform the 
   authentication. 
    
   If certificate-based authentication of the client is desired, the 
   client must have been issued a certificate and must have the private 
   key associated with that certificate. 
    
4.2 Phase 2: Tunneled Authentication 
    
   In phase 2, the TLS Record Layer is used to securely tunnel 
   information between the client and the TTLS server. This information 
   is encapsulated in sequences of attribute-value pairs (AVPs), whose 
   use and format are described in the next paragraph. 
    
   The server will ask the client to send its credentials for 
   authentication, and before asking for biometric data, the server 
   MUST ask the user's login. The user will then be asked to submit his 
   biometric characteristic to the reader. 
    


    
   Urien & All        Informational - Expires April 2010      [Page 8] 

 
   Such a procedure will allow the biometric characteristic to be 
   compared only with the sample of the specified user, instead of 
   testing all the database samples. Since the comparison algorithm may 
   be complex, a significant amount of time may be saved for the 
   authentication. 
    
   The login and the biometric characteristic are encapsulated in AVPs, 
   and then transmitted to the server through the secured TLS tunnel. 
   In accordance with the EAP-TTLS protocol, other data may be 
   exchanged between the client and the server using AVPs. 
    
   The TTLS server recovers the AVPs in clear text from the TLS record 
   layer. If the AVP sequence includes authentication information, it 
   forwards this information to the AAA/H server using the AAA carrier 
   protocol. Note that the EAP-TTLS and AAA/H servers may be one and 
   the same, in which case it simply processes the information locally. 
    
   When the TTLS server has gathered enough information, it issues 
   either an EAP-Success or EAP-Failure. Thus, if the AAA/H rejects the 
   client based on forwarded authentication information, the TTLS 
   server MUST issue an EAP-Failure. If the AAA/H accepts the client, 
   the TTLS server MUST issue an EAP-Success. 
    
   The TTLS server distributes data connection keying information and 
   other authorization information to the access point in the same AAA 
   carrier protocol message that carries the EAP-Success. 
    
4.3 AVP format 
    
   The format of an AVP is shown below. All items are in network, or 
   big-endian, order; that is, they have most significant octet first.

      |    Data... 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   AVP Code 
    
   The AVP Code is four octets and, combined with the Vendor-ID field 
   if present, identifies the attribute uniquely. The first 256 AVP 
   numbers represent attributes defined in RADIUS. AVP numbers 256 and 


    
   Urien & All        Informational - Expires April 2010      [Page 9] 

 
   above are defined in Diameter. The codes used in EAP-BIO are yet to 
   be defined. 
    
   AVP Flags 
    
   The AVP Flags field is one octet, and provides the receiver with 
   information necessary to interpret the AVP. 
    
   The 'V' (Vendor-Specific) bit indicates whether the optional 
   Vendor-ID field is present. When set to 1, the Vendor-ID field is 
   present and the AVP Code is interpreted according to the namespace 
   defined by the vendor indicated in the Vendor-ID field. 
    
   The 'M' (Mandatory) bit indicates whether support of the AVP is 
   required. If this bit is set to 0, this indicates that the AVP may 
   be safely ignored if the receiving party does not understand or 
   support it. If set to 1, this indicates that the receiving party 
   must fail the negotiation if it does not understand the AVP; for a 
   TTLS server, this would imply returning EAP-Failure, for a client, 
   this would imply abandoning the negotiation. 
    
   The 'r' (reserved) bits are unused and must be set to 0. 
    
   AVP Length 
    
   The AVP Length field is three octets, and indicates the length of 
   this AVP including the AVP Code, AVP Length, AVP Flags, Vendor-ID 
   (if present) and Data. 
    
   Vendor-ID 
    
   The Vendor-ID field is present if the 'V' bit is set in the AVP 
   Flags field. It is four octets, and contains the vendor's IANA-
   assigned "SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Codes" [9] 
   value. Vendors defining their own AVPs must maintain a consistent 
   namespace for use of those AVPs within RADIUS, Diameter and EAP-
   TTLS. 
   A Vendor-ID value of zero is equivalent to absence of the Vendor-ID 
   field altogether. 
    
4.4 AVP Sequences 
    
   Data encapsulated within the TLS Record Layer must consist entirely 
   of a sequence of zero or more AVPs. Each AVP must begin on a 4-octet 
   boundary relative to the first AVP in the sequence. If an AVP is not 
   a multiple of 4 octets, it must be padded with 0s to the next 4-
   octet boundary. 
    
   Note that the AVP Length does not include the padding.

5 Signatures and Smart Cards 
    
   Though EAP-TTLS offers high security for authentication, the 
   biometric equipments might be flawed and compromise the whole EAP-
   BIO protocol. The potential security flaws described in section 3.2 
   MUST be addressed with smart cards and cryptographic solutions such 
   as digital signatures. The number of signatures used in the protocol 
   will depend on the level of security required. 
    
5.1 Elements to be secured 
    
   The most important element to be secured should be the biometric 
   reader. In order to prevent material flaws, the reader MUST be 
   certified as secure. If it is not, a signature from the reader would 
   have no meaning. The secure biometric reader should then be affected 
   a smart card in order to store the private key required for the 
   signature. Thus, the biometric characteristic SHOULD be signed by 
   the reader, along with a trusted timestamp in order to prevent 
   replay attacks. 
    
   The client, whose the biometric characteristic is transmitted to, 
   SHOULD also sign the characteristic before sending it to the TTLS 
   server through the TLS record layer. 
    
   The third element which may require specific security is the user. 
   Depending on the use case of the EAP-BIO protocol, the 
   authentication may require a smart card from the user, containing 
   his personal public-key certificate. Such a security level may be 
   required in places such as airports. 
    
   Hence, the biometric authentication requires two or three 
   signatures, depending of the security requested. 
    
5.2 PKCS #1 Signature 
    
   The signature of the biometric characteristic, along with a trusted 
   timestamp in the case of the biometric reader, is computed according 
   to the PKCS #1 specifications [RFC 3447]. It is here encapsulated in 
   the data field of EAP-TTLS phase 2 AVPs (fourth octet and 
   following). 
    
   The signature is generated from two steps. The first one consists in 
   encoding the message using EMSA-PSS, described in section 9.1.1 of 
   RFC 3447. Since this is a probabilistic function, the signer has to 
   choose not only a hash function, but also a mask generation function 
   and a salt. The second one consists in the output of the RSA 
   signature. This signature is calculated out of three steps: 
    
   a. Converting the hashed message to an integer message 
   representative.  

    
   Urien & All        Informational - Expires April 2010      [Page 11] 

 
    
   b. Applying a RSA signature primitive (described in section 5.2.1 of 
   RFC 3447) to the private key and the message representative to 
   produce an integer signature representative. 
    
   c. Converting the signature representative to a signature of k 
   octets, where k is the length in octets of the RSA modulus n. 
    
6 Biometric Formats 
    
   Many biometric formats, protocols and definitions have been 
   standardized by international organizations such as ISO 
   (International Organization for Standardization), IEC (International 
   Electrotechnical Commission) or JTC1 (Joint Technical Committee 
   One). 
    
   EAP-BIO shall use the CBEFF (Common Biometric Exchange Formats 
   Framework) data structure, a standard regarding biometrics which 
   describes the necessary data to be inserted in the headers so that 
   different systems may exchange biometric data within only one file. 
   The CBEFF data structure is composed of three parts: the Standard 
   Biometric Header, the Biometric Data Block, and the Signature Block. 
   This data structure is used as a reference in the standards defined 
   for the different biometric characteristics. 
    
6.1 Fingerprint format 
    
   The requirements for fingerprint analysis are described in the 
   [ISO/IEC 19794] standard. It specifies the content, format and 
   measure units from a fingerprint picture to be used in 
   identification or authentication of a user. 
   The basic entities for fingerprint analysis are ridges and valleys 
   of the finger pattern, and more particularly specific points such as 
   ridge bifurcations (where a ridge is divided in two) and ridge 
   endpoints (where a ridge suddenly stops). The layout of these points 
   is specific to each individual, and as such represents significant 
   information for identification or authentication. 
   The format of a Finger Minutiae Record is described in the ISO/IEC 
   19794-2 standard, and can be represented as follows: 
    
   +------------------+------------------------+-------------------+ 
   |  Record Header   |  Single Finger Record  |  Extended Data    | 
   |    (24 bytes)    |         Format         | (variable length) | 
   |                  |   (variable length)    |                   | 
   +------------------+------------------------+-------------------+ 
    
   The header contains information about the characteristics and 
   options of the recording process (equipment, image size, resolution, 
   number of views). 
    

    
   Urien & All        Informational - Expires April 2010      [Page 12] 

 
   The Single Finger Record Format block is divided in two parts: the 
   Finger Header block (4 bytes) and the Finger Minutiae Data blocks (6 
   bytes per block). The Finger Header contains information about the 
   finger position, its quality, as well as the number of minutiae, 
   i.e. bifurcations or endpoints recorded on the fingerprint. The 
   Finger Minutiae Data blocks contain technical data about each 
   minutia recorded (position, angle, quality). One block is added for 
   each minutia. 
    
   The Extended Data fields may contain any relevant information about 
   the finger minutiae or about the record that could be of use to the 
   equipment retrieving the fingerprint data. The length of these 
   fields (there may be several of them) should be as small as 
   possible. 
    
6.2 Fingerprint Card format 
    
   The ISO/IEC 19794 standard also defines two possible formats for 
   cards: the Normal Size Finger Minutiae Format, in which the minutiae 
   data are encoded on five octets for each minutia (containing the 
   type, coordinates and angle), and the Compact Size Finger Minutiae 
   Format, in which these data are encoded with lower resolution on 
   three octets. 
    
7 PKCS #7 capsule 
    
   The biometric characteristic will be signed by two or three signers 
   before being sent to the TTLS server through AVPs. The format 
   described in [RFC 2315] defines two main types for the signature: 
   SignerInfo and SignedData. 
 
   For each signer, the encrypted message digest and other signer-
   specific information are collected into a SignerInfo value. 
   Certificates and certificate-revocation lists for each signer, and 
   those not corresponding to any signer, are collected in this step.  
   The defined format is the following: 
    
   SignerInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
   version Version, 
   issuerAndSerialNumber      IssuerAndSerialNumber, 
   digestAlgorithm            DigestAlgorithmIdentifier, 
   authenticatedAttributes    [0] IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL, 
   digestEncryptionAlgorithm  DigestEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier, 
   encryptedDigest            EncryptedDigest, 
   unauthenticatedAttributes  [1] IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL  
   } 
   EncryptedDigest ::= OCTET STRING 
    
   The timestamp required for the biometric reader signature may be 
   inserted in the authenticatedAttributes field.

   The message-digest algorithms and the SignerInfo values for all the 
   signers are collected together with the content into a PKCS#7 
   SignedData structure (Object Identifier 1.2.840.113549.1.7.2), the 
   format of which is defined as follows: 
 
   SignedData ::= SEQUENCE { 
   version Version, 
   digestAlgorithms DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers, 
   contentInfo ContentInfo, 
   certificates [0] IMPLICIT ExtendedCertificatesAndCertificates 
   OPTIONAL, 
   crls[1] IMPLICIT CertificateRevocationLists OPTIONAL, 
   signerInfos SignerInfos  
   } 
    
   DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers ::= SET OF DigestAlgorithmIdentifier 
    
   SignerInfos ::= SET OF SignerInfo 
    
   ContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
     contentType ContentType, 
     content 
       [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY contentType OPTIONAL } 
    
   ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
    
8 AVP examples 
    
   The EAP-BIO protocol makes use of AVPs in the second phase of the 
   EAP-TTLS protocol. These AVPs contain information as described in 
   the preceding sections, and can be represented as follows: 
    
   8.1 AVP containing biometric data 
    
   This example displays an AVP containing CBEFF fingerprint data 
   comprised of two minutiae block of the same finger:

                               HIP for IoT               October 2009 
 
1 Introduction 
    
   There are currently two main definitions for the Internet Of Things 
   (IoT): IoT dealing with tags, and IoT based on IP Smart Objects. 
    
1.1 Tags and Internet Of Things 
    
   The term Internet of Things (IoT) was invented by the MIT Auto-ID 
   Center, in 2001, and refers to an architecture that comprises four 
   levels, 
    
   - Passive tags, such as Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFIDs, introduced 
   by the EPC Global consortium and operating in the 860-960 MHz range. 
    
   - Readers plugged to a local (computing) system, which read the 
   Electronic Product Code [EPC]. 
    
   - A local system, offering IP connectivity, which collects 
   information pointed by the EPC thanks to a protocol called Object 
   Naming Service (ONS) 
    
   - EPCIS (EPC Information Services) servers, which process incoming 
   ONS requests and returns PML (Physical Markup Language) files [PML], 
   e.g. XML documents that carry meaningful information linked to tags. 
    
1.2 Smart Objects and Internet of Things 
    
   According to [IP-IOT], the IP protocol should be used to extend the 
   Internet Of Things to smart objects. Until recently, smart objects 
   were realized with limited communication capabilities, such as RFID 
   tags, but the new generation of devices has bidirectional wireless 
   communication and sensors that provide real-time data such as 
   temperature, pressure, vibrations, and energy measurement.  
   Smart objects can be battery-operated, but not always and typically 
   have three components:  
   - a CPU (8-, 16- or 32-bit micro-controller),  
   - memory (a few tens of kilobytes)  
   - and a low-power wireless communication device (from a few 
   kilobits/s to a few hundreds of kilobits/s).  
   The size is small and the price is low: a few square mm and few 
   dollars. 
    
2 Open issues 
    
2.1 What is a thing? 
    
   We distinguish two classes of things 
    
   1- Things that are computers equipped with communication interfaces. 
   2- Things that are not computers, but who are associated with 
   computers equipped with communication interfaces.

                               HIP for IoT               October 2009 
 
2.2 What is the identifier of a thing? 
    
   They are several proposals: 
    
   1- A serial number, such as an EPC code. 
   2- An IP address. 
   3- Other, for example a fix hash value such HIT proposed by [HIP], 
   or adhoc naming scheme [HIP-Naming]. 
    
2.3 Authentication 
    
   Is there a way to authenticate a thing? In other words is it 
   possible and needed to prove the identity of a thing. This proof 
   could establish the physical/logical integrity of a computer, or the 
   integrity of an electronic passport. 
    
2.4 Identity Protection 
    
   Things can be used to track people or objects, which are identified 
   by a set of things. Identity protection enforces privacy by hiding 
   things identities thanks to cryptographic means. For example such 
   mechanisms are described in [HIP-TAG]. 
    
2.5 Communication Protocol 
    
   A thing communicates with the Internet network by various interfaces 
    
   1- Via MAC (OSI2) radio protocols, as defined in [EPCGLOBAL] 
   2- Thanks the IP protocol, in that case the thing is an IP node, and 
   is natively plugged in the Internet Cloud. 
   3- Other, for example the Host Identity Protocol [HIP] 
    
2.6 Things to Things communications 
    
   In some cases, things communicate with other things. If identity 
   protection is required, the associated infrastructure is complex 
   from a cryptographic or physical point of view, because classical 
   routing techniques can't be used. 
    
3 HIP for the Internet Of Things 
    
3.1 HIP Benefits 
    
   We suggest defining a new version of the HIP protocol, dedicated to 
   the Internet Of Things issues, according to the following arguments 
    
   1- Things are associated to Identifiers. IP addresses are usually 
   understood as locators and not identifiers. In this identity-based 
   approach the infrastructure to which the thing is connected belongs 
   to the internet network, but even if the thing comprises an IP 
   stack, the IP address is not correlated with the thing identity.

   2- The actual version of HIP provides inter HIP nodes communications 
   thanks to ESP secure channels. This paradigm could be re-used for 
   things to things communication, compatible with the IP 
   infrastructure. 
    
3.2 HIP issues for the Internet Of things 
    
   1- Identifiers. HIP Identifiers (HIT) rely on cryptographic 
   procedures, i.e. a digest of an RSA public key. A new naming scheme 
   SHOULD be defined 
    
   2- Identity Protection. No Identity Protection is supported. 
   Therefore HIP nodes MAY be easily tracked. We believe that Identity 
   Protection MUST be supported. 
    
   3- Communication Architecture. If identity protection is supported, 
   some trusted gateways SHOULD be used in order to establish 
   communications with things.

5 Security Considerations

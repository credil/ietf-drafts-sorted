Abstract 
    
   Most of privacy exchanges over the Internet rely on the TLS protocol. 
   According to this protocol two entities the client and the server 
   computes a master secret from which are deduced cryptographic keys 
   used for data privacy and security. Digital transactions may deal 
   with critical information (payments ...) that need to be recorded for 
   traceability issues or for legal requirements. However messages are 
   secured by the TLS protocol, so it is not possible for a third party 
   that logs packets to perform decryption operations upon legitimate 
   requests. 
    
   The goal of this draft is to support a Trusted Third Party (TTP) that 
   could recover the protected information when needed. The proposed 
   protocol uses the Tripartite Diffie-Hellman (tdh) algorithm based on 
   bilinear pairings over elliptic curves.

          TLS tripartite Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange      June 2010 
 
1 Overview 
    
   Most of privacy exchanges over the Internet rely on the TLS protocol. 
   According to this protocol two entities the client and the server 
   computes a master secret from which are deduced cryptographic keys 
   used for data privacy and security. 
    
   Digital transactions may deal with critical information (payments 
   ...) that need to be recorded for traceability issues or for legal 
   requirements. 
    
   However messages are secured by the TLS protocol, so it is not 
   possible to a third party that logs packets to perform decryption 
   operations upon legitimate requests. 
    
   The idea of this proposal is to support a Trusted Third Party (TTP) 
   that could recover the protected information when needed. 
    
   The Tripartite Diffie-Hellman (tdh) idea was initially introduced in 
   [TDH]. 
    
   Toady cryptography provides efficient software tools [PBC] computing 
   bilinear pairing over elliptic curve. The [TLS-ECC] standard already 
   supports cryptographic operations based on elliptic curves, mainly 
   for key exchange based on ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman) or the 
   ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signature. 
    
   The Weil pairing for example works with classical elliptic curves; 
   server and client are equipped with DH public and private keys. 
    
   The classical TLS pre-master-secret is computed according to the 
   relation 
    
   pre-master-secret = abP (or g^ab with multiplicative notations) 
    
   Where P is a point of an elliptic curve point (a generator) defined 
   over a Fq field, aP and bP are respectively the server and client DH 
   public keys, and a,b their private keys. 
    
   If the client and the server agree to use a TTP, identified by an 
   attribute ttp-name and owning a DH public key cP, the pre-master-
   secret is computing according to the following relation: 
    
   Sclient = e(aP,cP)^b  
   Sserver = e(bP,cP)^a  
   Sttp    = e(aP,bP)^c, 
    
   S = Sserver = Sclient = Sttp = shared-secret 
    
   S is an element of F(q^k), with k integer

          TLS tripartite Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange      June 2010 
 
   pre-master-secret = h(S), h a hash function producing p bits 
    
   In other words each entity (client, server, TTP) computes a shared 
   secret S by using its private DH key and the two other public DH 
   keys. 
    
   The master-secret is thereafter produced: 
    
   master_secret = PRF(pre-master-secret, 
                       "master secret", 
                        ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random). 
    
   The master secret is computed by the client and the server without a 
   dialog with the TTP. But the TTP will be able to recover the master 
   secret from the TLS session logs. 
    
    
                Client                       Server

2 About Bilinear Pairing 
    
2.1 Symmetric Bilinear Pairing 
    
   Z is the set of integer. 
   r is a prime integer 
    
   Let (G1,+) be a cyclic group of order r, (with additive operation +) 
   Let (G2,*) be a cyclic group of order r, (with multiplicative 
   operation x). 
    
   Let e a non-degenerate bilinear map, G1 x G1 -> G2 
    
   A non-degenerate bilinear pairing satisfies the following conditions: 
    
   - Bilinear: 
     for P,Q elements of G1, a,b elements of Z, e(aP,bP)=e(P,Q)^ab

          TLS tripartite Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange      June 2010 
 
   - Non-Degenerate: 
     e(P,P)#1 is a generator of G2 
    
   The Weil pairing [ECC] has been defined for elliptic curve [ECC] over 
   finite field of prime characteristic p (Fp) 
    
   - ECC is an elliptic curve over Fp 
   - G1 is a subgroup in ECC(Fp), whose order is r 
   - G2 is a subgroup in F(p^k), k an integer 
    
2.2 Asymmetric Bilinear Pairing 
    
   In that case the bilinear map works with two different groups G1, 
   whose order is r, and G1', where each element has order dividing r. 
    
   e is a non-degenerate bilinear map, G1 x G1' -> G2 
    
   For P elements of G1, Q element of G1', a,b elements of Z : 
   e(aP,bQ)=e(P,Q)^ab 
    
   The Tate pairing [ECC] has been defined for elliptic curve [ECC] over 
   finite field of prime characteristic p (Fp). 
    
   - ECC is an elliptic curve over Fp 
   - G1  is a subgroup in ECC(Fp), whose order is r 
   - G1' is a subgroup in ECC(Fp^k), with k integer (k is the elliptic 
   curve embedding degree) 
   - G2  is a subgroup in F(p^k) 
    
    
2.3 The Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) problem. 
    
   P is a generator of G1 
    
   a,b,c are elements of Zr* 
    
   BDH: Knowing P, aP, bP, cP the computation of e(P,P)^abc is 
   'impossible' 
    
   Furthermore the classical computational Diffie Hellman (CDH) 
   assumption is assumed for the group G1. 
    
   CDH: Knowing P, aP, bP the computation of abP is 'impossible' 
    
2.4 Practical properties 
    
  2.4.1 Symmetric Pairing 
    
   We suppose three entities A (server), B (client), C (ttp) equipped 
   with three pairs of public and private keys, associated with a group 
   G1 and a generator P. 

   Urien                    Expires January 2011           [Page 6] 
 
          TLS tripartite Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange      June 2010 
 
    
   aP and a, are respectively the public and the private keys for A 
   bP and b, are respectively the public and the private keys for B 
   cP and c, are respectively the public and the private keys for C 
    
   A shared secret (S) may be computed by these three entities, 
   according to the following scenario: 
    
   - A computes S = e^a(bP,cP) = e(P,P)^abc 
   - B computes S = e^b(aP,cP) = e(P,P)^abc 
   - C computes S = e^c(aP,bP) = e(P,P)^abc 
    
   In other word each entity computes a shared secret key, deduced from 
   its private key and the two other public key. 
    
   If A is a client, B a server and C a trusted party, all security 
   properties such as encrypted packets exchanged between client and 
   server may be recovered by the trusted party. 
    
  2.4.2 Asymmetric pairing 
    
   We suppose three entities A (server), B (client), C (ttp) equipped 
   with pairs of public and private keys, associated with the group G1 
   (generator P) and the group G1' (generator P'). 
    
   aP, aP' and a, are respectively the public and the private keys for A 
   bP and b, are respectively the public and the private key for B 
   cP, cP' and c, are respectively the public and the private keys for C 
    
   A shared secret (S) may be computed by these three entities, 
   according to the following scenario 
    
   - A computes S = e^b(bP,cP') = e(P,P')^abc 
   - B computes S = e^b(aP,cP') = e(P,P')^abc 
   - C computes S = e^c(aP,bP') = e(P,P')^abc

   The TLS dialog is illustrated by figure 2. A new extension is used 
   both by client and server in order to negotiate a pairing scheme. The 
   TTP is selected thanks attributes exchanged in the ServerKeyExchange 
   and ClientKeyExchange messages. Elliptic curve and DH parameter are 
   specified according to [TLS-ECC]. 
    
4. Bilinear Pairing Operations details 
    
4.1 TLS Extension 
    
   A new TLS extension is defined in this specification: the pairing-
   scheme extension. 
    
   The general structure of TLS extensions is described in [TLS 1.1], 
   and this specification adds one new item to ExtensionType. 
    
   enum { pairing-scheme(xx)} ExtensionType; 
    
   The client negotiates the pairing-scheme via the corresponding 
   extension inserted in the client hello message 
    
   The server selects one of the proposed items and inserts it in the 
   server hello message. 
    
    
   Two other extensions are imported from [TLS-ECC]: 
    
   - elliptic-curves(10), 
   - ec_point-formats(11); 
    
  4.1.1 Supported Pairing Scheme 
    
   Supported Pairing Scheme 
           enum { 
                  Weil-Pairing (1) 
                } NamedScheme; 
    
4.2 Key Exchange 
    
   A new KeyExchange Algorithm is defined: ec-bilinear-pairing 
    
  4.2.1 Trusted-Third-Party list 
    
   Each trusted third party (TTP) is identified by a name. A DH public 
   key is implicitly deduced from its identifier.

   struct { 
           TTP-Name ttp-name-list<0..2^24-1>; 
          } TTP-List; 
    
    
  4.2.1 Server Key Exchange 
    
   The ServerKeyExchange message is extended as follows. 
    
           enum { ec-bilinear-pairing } KeyExchangeAlgorithm; 
    
           select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) { 
               case ec_bilinear-pairing: 
                   ServerECDHParams    params; 
                   Signature           signed-params; 
                   TTP-List            ttp-list 
           } ServerKeyExchange; 
    
   The attributes ServerECDHParams and Signature are imported from [TLS-
   ECC] 
    
  4.2.2 Client Key Exchange 
    
   The ClientKeyExchange message is extended as follows. 
    
           struct { 
               select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) { 
                   case ec_bilinear-pairing: 
                   ClientECDiffieHellmanPublic; 
                   TTP-Name: ttp-name  
                   } exchange-keys; 
           } ClientKeyExchange; 
    
   The attribute ClientECDiffieHellmanPublic is imported from [TLS-ECC]. 
    
4.3 PreMasterSecret computing 
    
   aP and bP are respectively the server and the client DH public values

5. Example of pairings 
    
   This example has been computed with the Pairing-Based Cryptography 
   Library [PBC] [BL]. 
    
5.1 Symmetric pairing 
    
   The elliptic curve (ECC) is chosen as: 
   y^2 = x^3 + x, with x, y elements of a Field Fq 
    
   q is a prime number, with q = 3 modulus 4 
   G1 is a subgroup of ECC(Fq) 
   G2 is a subgroup of Fq^2 
    
   There are q+1 points on the ECC curve, i.e. #ECC(Fq) = q+1 
    
   r = order of G1 = prime factor of q+1. 
   h = cofactor = #ECC(Fq) / r  
    
   q=8780710799663312522437781984754049815806883199414208211028653399266

           Extensible XDR Discriminated Union Primitive Type
                     draft-keiser-afs3-xdr-union-02

Abstract

   AFS-3 relies upon XDR to carry Rx RPC call payloads.  XDR
   discriminated unions are ill-suited to cases where the protocol needs
   to evolve without inventing new RPCs, i.e., unknown discriminant
   values cause the entire XDR payload to fail the decoding step.  While
   this can be circumvented through the use of opaque payloads (and
   recursive XDR invocations), such solutions are inelegant and
   difficult to implement.  This memo defines a new XDR primitive type,
   "ext-union", which is derived from the XDR discriminated union
   primitive type, but with two key variations: 1) each leg contains a
   length field, and 2) no default leg is supported.

1.  Introduction

   AFS-3 [AFS1] [AFS2] is a distributed file system that has its origins
   in the VICE project [CMU-ITC-84-020] [VICE1] at the Carnegie Mellon
   University Information Technology Center [CMU-ITC-83-025], a joint
   venture between CMU and IBM.  VICE later became AFS when CMU moved
   development to a new commercial venture called Transarc Corporation,
   which later became IBM Pittsburgh Labs.  AFS-3 is a suite of un-
   standardized network protocols based on a remote procedure call (RPC)
   suite known as Rx [AFS3-RX].  While de jure standards for AFS-3 fail
   to exist, the various AFS-3 implementations have agreed upon certain
   de facto standards, largely helped by the existence of an open source
   fork called OpenAFS that has served the role of reference
   implementation.  In addition to using OpenAFS as a reference, IBM
   wrote and donated developer documentation that contains somewhat
   outdated specifications for the Rx protocol and all AFS-3 remote
   procedure calls, as well as a detailed description of the AFS-3
   system architecture.

   The Rx RPC protocol utilizes XDR [RFC4506] as its means of encoding
   RPC call and response payloads.  XDR provides a discriminated union
   type.  However, the semantics of the discriminated union base type do
   not lend themselves to evolution of the discriminant namespace:
   introduction of new discriminants--when there is no default leg--
   cause the remainder of the XDR octet stream to be un-parseable (due
   to the lack of a length field in the encoding) by older peers.  This
   memo introduces a new XDR primitive type that is identical to the XDR
   discriminated union, except that: 1) each leg contains a length
   field, and 2) the default leg is disallowed.

1.1.  Use Case

   Given that this design doubles the overhead from 4 to 8 octets
   (relative to the XDR discriminated union primitive type), it is ill-
   suited for use with small implied legs.  Within the AFS-3 protocol
   suite, the primary use case for the extensible union type is to wrap
   large data structures, rather than small primitive types.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Extensible Discriminated Union

   The extensible discriminated union will contain a length field in
   every leg so that decoding peers can compute the offset of the next
   object in the XDR octet stream, regardless of whether the
   discriminant is recognized.  For small legs, this will result in
   significant encoding inefficiency, but it is necessary to permit the
   union to evolve over time (without peers failing to decode the entire
   XDR octet stream).

3.1.  Extensible Union Type

   The definition of the extensible discriminated union is derived from
   the XDR union defined in section 4.15 of the XDR specification
   [RFC4506].  Unlike XDR discriminated unions, the XDR types mapped to
   each arm of the union need not be defined a priori.  Instead, the
   length of the arm is always included in the wire encoding along with
   the discriminant value, thus permitting the decoder to continue
   decoding past an unknown discriminant in an XDR octet stream.

   How undefined discriminants are handled by the decoder is
   deliberately left unspecified by this document.  Rather, this memo
   merely specifies which error conditions must be flagged to the caller
   (see Section 3.4.1).  The error handling semantics--for both length
   mismatches and unknown discriminants--are left up to the definition
   of any type built upon the ext-union primitive type.  While this
   lends significant flexibility to the design, it also permits XDR
   decoding to continue when the expected implied arm length doesn't
   match the length on the wire.  It is RECOMMENDED that implementations
   fail to decode the entire XDR stream when such a length mismatch is
   encountered, as such a length mismatch is indicative of either: 1) a
   significant divergence in RPC-L definitions across the peers, or 2)
   an undetected bit error in the XDR octet stream.

   Extensible discriminated unions are defined in RPC-L as follows:

       ext-union switch (discriminant-definition) {
       case discriminant-value-A:
          arm-declaration-A;
       case discriminant-value-B:
          arm-declaration-B;
       ...
       } identifier;

                                 Figure 1

   Because the discriminant namespace of an extensible union must be
   capable of evolving over time, it is not possible to support a
   default leg.

   The extensible discriminated union is encoded on the wire as: a
   4-octet discriminant, followed by a 4-octet arm length, and finally
   the variable-length implied arm.  The arm length field SHALL count
   the length of the implied arm in octets, and only the implied arm.
   In other words, the 8 octets occupied by the discriminant and arm
   length fields SHALL NOT be counted as part of the arm length value.

               0   1   2   3
             +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
             |  discriminant |   arm length  |  implied arm  |
             +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
             |<---4 octets-->|<---4 octets-->|

                                 Figure 2

   Thus, in terms of existing XDR primitives, we can describe an
   extensible discriminated union as follows:

       struct ext_union {
           unsigned int discriminant;
           opaque implied_leg<>;
       };

                                 Figure 3

   It should be noted that this design makes it convenient to implement
   extensible discriminated unions on top of existing XDR primitive
   types.

3.2.  RPC-L Changes

   In order to implement the above, the XDR grammar, as specified in
   Section 6.3 of [RFC4506], will need to be modified in the following
   ways:

   o  "type-specifier" will require a new production rule mapping to
      "ext-union-type-spec", and

   o  an "ext-union-type-spec" production rule will need to be defined.

   The "type-specifier" grammar will now include a new production rule
   for "ext-union-type-spec":

       type-specifier:
            [ "unsigned" ] "int"
          | [ "unsigned" ] "hyper"
          | "float"
          | "double"
          | "quadruple"
          | "bool"
          | enum-type-spec
          | struct-type-spec
          | union-type-spec
          | identifier
          | ext-union-type-spec

                                 Figure 4

   The new "ext-union-type-spec" production rule, and the production
   rule for its nonterminal symbol dependency "ext-union-body", are
   defined as follows:

       ext-union-type-spec:
          "ext-union" ext-union-body

       ext-union-body:
          "switch" "(" declaration ")" "{"
             case-spec
             case-spec *
          "}"

                                 Figure 5

3.3.  Encoding

   It is RECOMMENDED that encoding of an AFS-3 extensible union proceed
   using the following algorithm:

   1.  encode an XDR unsigned 32-bit integer (see Section 4.2 of
       [RFC4506]) containing the discrimant,

   2.  XDR encode into temporary storage the implied leg (according to
       the type definition of the type specified for this discriminant

       value in the ext-union definition), and

   3.  encode the implied leg using the XDR variable-length opaque
       specification (see Section 4.10 of [RFC4506]).

3.4.  Decoding

   It is RECOMMENDED that decoding of an AFS-3 extensible union proceed
   using the following algorithm:

   1.  XDR decode the 32-bit unsigned integer containing the
       discriminant;

   2.  XDR decode the variable-length opaque blob into temporary
       storage;

   3.  If this is a known discriminant:

       1.  Lookup the discriminant, and compare the expected length with
           the length of the previously-decoded XDR variable-length
           opaque;

       2.  If the expected and actual lengths match:

           1.  The implied leg's payload should be XDR decoded
               (according to the type definition of the type specified
               for this discriminant value in the ext-union definition);

       3.  If the expected and actual lengths do not match:

           1.  Mark the union as failed to decode due to a length
               mismatch;

   4.  However, if this is an unknown discriminant:

       1.  Mark the union as failed to decode due to an unknown
           discriminant;

   5.  XDR decoding continues at the current offset plus the length of
       the previously-decoded XDR variable-length opaque.

3.4.1.  Error Handling

   While the specific decoding algorithm used is left up to the
   implementor, error handling MUST be implemented as described in this
   section.

   Unknown Discriminant:

       When a decoder encounters an unknown discriminant, it MUST mark
       the discriminant as unknown, and SHOULD proceed to decoding the
       next element in the XDR stream by seeking past the length and
       implied leg fields.

   Unexpected Length for Discriminant:

       When a decoder encounters a length field that doesn't agree with
       the length expected for this discriminant, it MUST mark the
       discriminant as failed to decode due to a length mismatch, and
       SHOULD fail to decode the rest of the XDR octet stream.


4.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Jeffrey Hutzelman for proposing
   standardization of a new XDR primitive type; and Andrew Deason, Simon
   Wilkinson, Derrick Brashear, and Matt Benjamin for helping to refine
   the design of this extensible union type.  Finally, the author would
   like to thank the attendees of the 2011 Pittsburgh AFS Hackathon for
   their review and comments regarding the -01 draft.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


6.  AFS Assign Numbers Registrar Considerations

   This memo includes no request to the AFS Assigned Numbers Registrar.


7.  Security Considerations

   Users of this extensible type should understand that any Rx XDR
   payload is only as secure as the security class bound to the Rx
   connection in question.  This document merely standardizes a
   primitive type; it is up to the authors of standards defining new
   types (upon the "ext-union" primitive type) to ensure that the
   contents of their types are only marshalled over sufficiently-secure
   security classes.

   Decoders should take special care when encountering unexpected
   implied arm lengths.  This could be indicative of serious errors,
   such as octet stream bit errors that were undetected by lower-layer

   checksums.  At the very least, this error condition implies that the
   peers do not agree upon their ext-union type-to-discriminant
   mappings.  It is RECOMMENDED that decoders treat this as a hard error
   and fail to decode the remainder of the XDR octet stream.

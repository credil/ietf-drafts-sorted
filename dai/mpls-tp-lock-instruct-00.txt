Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP Lock Instruction            October 2009


1.  Introduction

   MPLS-TP OAM Requirements document[MPLS-TP OAM Requirements] lists
   architectural and functional requirements for the Operations,
   Administration and Maintenance of MPLS Transport Profile.  One of
   these functionalities is Lock Instruction, which can enable an End
   Point of a PW, LSP or Section to instruct its associated End Point(s)
   to lock the PW, LSP or Section.  Further, this function SHOULD be
   performed on-demand between End Points of PWs, LSPs and Sections.

   Besides, MPLS-TP OAM Requirements document also requires that the
   protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function MUST also
   apply to point-to-point associated bidirectional[RFC5654] LSPs,
   point-to-point unidirectional LSPs and point-to-multipoint LSPs.

   The solutions proposed in this draft can meet all the above
   requirements.

   When an operator wants to set a path into loopback mode for
   management purposes, e.g., to test or verify connectivity to a
   specific node on the path, to test the performance with respect to
   delay/jitter/throughput, etc., especially out-of-service performance
   measurement, which may affect user traffic transmition, one SHOULD
   first set that path to lock mode.  Through this mechnism, associated
   nodes can distiguish this management situation from a failure
   situation on the tested path.

3.  MPLS-TP Lock Instruction Message

   This section proposes one message format for lock instruction
   operation, and two optional TLVs.

3.1.  MPLS-TP Lock Instruction message Indentification

3.1.1.  In-band message Indentification

   In the in-band option, under MPLS label stack of the MPLS-TP LSP, the
   ACH[RFC5586] with "MPLS-TP Lock Instruct" code point indicates that
   the message is an MPLS-TP Lock Instruction message, the ACH format in
   this case is shown as Figure 1:



          0                   1                   2                   3
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |0 0 0 1|Version|   Reserved    |0xHH(MPLS-TP Lock Instruct)    |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



                 Figure 1: In-band message Indentification

   The first nibble (0001) indicates the ACH.  The version and the
   reserved values are both set to 0.  MPLS-TP lock instruction code
   point is 0xHH.  [HH to be assigned by IANA from the PW Associated
   Channel Type registry.]

3.1.2.  Out-of-band message Indentification

   [To be added in future]

3.2.  MPLS-TP Lock Instruction Message Format

   The proposed format of an MPLS-TP Lock Instruction Message is shown
   in Figure 2.

   Version

   The Version Number is currently 0.  (Note: the version number is to
   be incremented whenever a change is made that affects the ability of
   an implementation to correctly parse or process an MPLS-TP Lock
   Instruction message.  These changes include any syntactic or semantic
   changes made to any of the fixed fields, or to any Type-Length-Value
   (TLV) or sub-TLV assignment or format that is defined at a certain
   version number.  The version number may not need to be changed if an
   optional TLV or sub-TLV is added.)

   Message Type

   Two message types are defined as shown below:


                   Message Type           Description

                       0x2               unlock request
                       0x3               unlock response


   Lock Type

   Three lock types are defined as shown below:

                        ---------             ------------------
                         0x0                   unidirectional lock
                         0x1                   bidirectional lock

   The Return code and Cause code only have meaning in a Lock response
   message.  In a Lock request message, the return code and cause code
   must be set to zero and ignored on receipt.

   This section defines two TLV types that will be used in an MPLS-TP
   lock instruction message, both these two TLVs are optional.

   This TLV is used to identify the source or destination node(s) of the
   path that will be locked by an operator.  In a Lock message, it MUST

4.  MPLS-TP Lock Instruction Operations

4.1.  General Procedures

4.1.1.  Sending a lock request message

   When an operator wants to lock an LSP, it first creates lock request
   messages according to lock type: unidirectional lock or bidirectional
   lock.  Then it sends lock request messages periodically to
   destination node(s) according to the interval specified by period
   feild.  This message may carries source/destination MEP TLV, or
   authentication TLV.

4.1.2.  Receiving a lock request message

   When a node receives a lock request message, it first examines
   whether the source or destination MEP match with itself.  If source
   MEP does not match, the event is logged and processing ceases.  In
   case of bidirectional lock, if the destination MEP does not match, it
   will send a response message with a return code of 0 and a cause code
   1.  Futhermore, it will excute more examinations as specified in
   section 4.2.

4.1.3.  Sending a lock response message

   Note: In case of unidirectional lock, the receipt node first
   identifies whether the path is a bidirectional path or a
   unidirectional path.  If the requested path is unidirectional, it
   will not send lock response messages to the source node; otherwise,
   it will send a response message along the backward direction to the
   source node.

   After all the examinations in the former step, the receipt node of
   lock request message will create a response message according to the
   examined results, with proper return code and cause code.

4.1.4.  Receiving a lock response message

   When the source node receive a lock response, it will parse this
   message, and:

   (1) if the return code is "success", it will cease to send lock
   request messages to destination node(s).

   (2) if the return code is "failure", it will keep on sending lock
   request messages to destination node(s) until it receives the first
   lock response message with return code "success".

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP Lock Instruction            October 2009


4.1.5.  Unlock procedures

   When the source node wants to unlock a path which is in a locked
   state, it SHOULD do as below:

   (1) The source node sends an unlock request message to destination
   node(s), thereinto lock type is "lock clear" and message type is
   "unlock request".

   (2) When a destination node receives such a unlock request message,
   if it agrees to unlock this path as well as this path is a
   bidirectional path, it will send an unlock response message to the
   source node with a return code "success".  If this path is a
   unidirectional path, it won't send a respose message.

   The source node will stop sending unlock request messages once it
   receives a response message with a return code "success".

4.2.  Example Topology

   Assume an MPLS-TP bidirectional LSP (either associated bidirectional
   or co-touted bidirectional[RFC5654]) A--B--C--D, where node A and D
   are MEPs, B and C are MIPs[MPLS-TP Framework].

   For unidirectional lock instruction, in case of lock the direction
   from A to D:

   (1) Node A periodcally sends Lock instruction messages to node D, in
   which lock type is unidirectional lock, and message type is lock
   request.

   (2) On receipt of such a message, node B and C transparently transmit
   it to next downstream node(s).

   (3) While node D receives the message, it will analyse it and node D
   knows that this is an unidirectional lock. it will create a lock
   response massage according to the rules below:

   a. if the source MEP ID does not match, the event is logged and
   processing ceases.

   b. if the destination MEP ID does not match, D sends a response with
   a return code of 0 and a cause code 1.

   Then D examines the message, and:

   c. if the message is malformed, it sends a response with a return
   code of 0 and a cause code 2 back to A.

   d. if message authentication fails, it MAY sends a response with a
   return code of 0 and a cause code 4 back to A.

   e. if any of the TLVs is not known, it sends a response with a return
   code of 0 and a cause code 3 back to A. It may also includes the
   unknown TLVs.

   f. if the path is already locked, it sends a response with return
   code of 1 (success) and a cause code 5 back to A.

   g. if the path is not already locked and cannot be locked, it sends a
   response with a return code of 0 and a cause code 7 back to A.

   h. if the path is successfully locked, it sends a response with an
   return code of 1 (success) and a cause code 0 back to A

   After the above operations, the direction from A to D is locked,
   while node D can also transmits user traffic and OAM massages to node
   A.

   For bidirectional lock instruct, which means lock both directions
   from A to D and D to A:

   (1) Node A periodcally sends Lock instruction messages to node D, in
   which lock type is bidirectional lock, and message type is lock
   request.

   (2) On receipt of such a message, node B and C transparently transmit
   it to next node(s).

   (3) While node D receives this message, it will analyses it.  After
   that, node D knows that this is an bidirectional lock, it will create
   a lock response massage according to the rules above, and sends it to
   node A.

   Through the above operations, both directions of this bidirectional
   path are locked, which means node A and D can neither transmit user
   traffic to each other.

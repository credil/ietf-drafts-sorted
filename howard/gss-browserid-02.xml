      <t>
This document defines protocols, procedures and conventions for a Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) security mechanism based on the BrowserID authentication mechanism. Through the GS2 family of mechanisms defined in RFC 5801, these protocols also define how Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC 4422) applications may use BrowserID.</t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction" anchor="d1e825">
      <t><xref target="BrowserID"/> is a web-based three-party security protocol by which user agents can present to a Relying Party (RP) a signed assertion of e-mail address ownership. BrowserID was intended to be used for web authentication. We find BrowserID to be useful in general, therefore we define herein how to use it in many more applications.</t>
      <t>
The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) <xref target="RFC4422"/> is a framework for providing authentication and message protection services via pluggable mechanisms. Protocols that support it include IMAP, SMTP, and XMPP.</t>
      <t>
The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) <xref target="RFC2743"/> provides a framework for authentication and message protection services through a common programming interface. This document conforms to the SASL and GSS-API bridge specified in <xref target="RFC5801"/>, so it defines both a SASL and GSS-API mechanism.</t>
      <t>
The BrowserID mechanism described in this document reuses the existing web-based BrowserID protocol, but profiles it for use in applications that support SASL or GSS-API, adding features such as key agreement, mutual authentication, and fast re-authentication.</t>
      <t>
The following diagram illustrates the interactions between the three parties in the GSS BrowserID protocol. Note that the terms client, initiator and user agent (UA) are used interchangeably in this document, as are server, acceptor and relying party (RP). </t>

      <section title="Discovery and Negotiation" anchor="d1e893">
        <t>
The means of discovering GSS-API peers and their supported mechanisms is out of this specification's scope. They may use SASL <xref target="RFC4422"/> or the Simple and Protected Negotiation mechanism (SPNEGO) <xref target="RFC4178"/>.</t>
        <t>
Discovery of a BrowserID identity provider (IdP) for a user is described in the BrowserID specification. A domain publishes a document containing their public key and URIs for authenticating and provisioning users, or pointer to an authority containing such a document.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Authentication" anchor="d1e917">
        <t>
The GSS-API protocol involves a client, known as the initiator, sending an initial security context token of a chosen GSS-API security mechanism to a peer, known as the acceptor. The two peers subsequently exchange, synchronously, as many security context tokens as necessary to complete the authentication or fail. The specific number of context tokens exchanged varies by security mechanism: in the case of the BrowserID mechanism, it is typically two (i.e. a single round trip), however it can be more in some cases. Once authentication is complete, the initiator and acceptor share a security context which identifies the peers and can optionally be used for integrity or confidentiality protecting subsequent application messages.</t>
        <t>
The original BrowserID protocol, as defined outside this document, specifies a bearer token authentication protocol for web applications. The user agent generates a short-term key pair, the public key of which is signed by the user's IdP. (The user must have already authenticated to the IdP; how this is done is not specified by BrowserID, but forms-based authentication is common.) The IdP returns a certificate for the user which may be cached by the user's browser. When authenticating to a Relying Party (RP), the browser generates an identity assertion containing the RP domain and an expiration time. The user agent signs this and presents both the assertion and certificate to the RP. (The combination of an assertion and zero or more certificates is termed a “backed assertion”.) The RP fetches the public key for the IdP, validates the user's certificate (and those of any intermediate certifying parties) and then verifies the assertion.</t>
        <t>
The GSS BrowserID protocol extends this by having the RP always send back a response to the user agent, which at a minimum provides key confirmation (this is needed for some key agreement methods) and indicates the lifetime of the established security context. The key confirmation token is also required for mutual authentication, when the initiator application requests that feature.</t>

      <section title="Message protection services" anchor="d1e933">

 shared key derivation (e.g., for keying external confidentiality+integrity layers)</t>
          </list>
        </t>

    <section title="Naming" anchor="d1e979">
      <t>
The GSS-API provides a rich security principal naming model. At its most basic the query forms of names consist of a user-entered/displayable string and a “name-type”. Name-types are constants with names prefixed with “GSS_C_NT_” in the GSS-API. Names may also have attributes <xref target="RFC6680"/>.</t>

        <t>
The BrowserID GSS-API mechanism performs no name canonicalization. The mechanism's GSS_Canonicalize_name() returns an MN whose display form is the same as the query form. Of course, the principal named obtained from a CREDENTIAL HANDLE may be canonical in that the IdP might only issue credentials for canonical names, but credential acquisition is out of scope here.</t>

        <t>
          <cref>
Do we wish to say anything about the exported composite name token format? It should be an encoding of the initiator's leaf certificate.</cref>

The acceptor MAY surface attributes from the assertion and any certificates using GSS_Get_name_attribute() (see <xref target="RFC6680"/>). The URN prefix is "urn:&lt;TBD&gt;:params:gss:jwt". If a SAML assertion is present in the "saml" parameter of the leaf certificate, it may be surfaced using the URN prefix "urn:&lt;TBD&gt;:params:gss:federated-saml-attribute".</t>

Attributes from the assertion MUST be marked as unauthenticated unless otherwise validated by the acceptor (e.g. the audience).</t>

Unlike many other GSS-API mechanisms such as Kerberos, this token framing is not used by subsequent context or by <xref target="I-D.zhu-negoex"/> metadata tokens. As such, pure SASL implementations of this mechanism do not need to deal with DER encoding the mechanism object identifier.</t>
          <t>
GSS BrowserID is a family of mechanisms, where the last element in the OID arc indicates the <xref target="RFC4121"/> encryption type supported for message protection services. The OID prefix is 1.3.6.1.4.1.5322.24.1. The NULL encryption type is valid, in which case services that require a key are not available.</t>
          <t>
The innerToken consists of the initiator context token ID concatenated with a backed assertion for the audience corresponding to the target name passed into GSS_Init_sec_context(). In addition, the assertion MAY contain the additional claims, which are described later in this document:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
ECDH key agreement parameters (see  <xref target="sub_request_ecdh"/>)</t>

A nonce for binding the request to a response signed with a private key for mutual authentication (see  <xref target="sub_request_nonce"/>)</t>

A ticket identifier for fast re-authentication using an established session key rather than a BrowserID certificate (see  <xref target="sub_request_tkt"/>)</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
The call to GSS_Init_sec_context() returns GSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED to indicate that a subsequent context token from the acceptor is expected.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Acceptor context token" anchor="sub_Acceptor_context_token">
          <t>
Upon receiving a context token from the initiator, the acceptor validates that the token is well formed and contains a valid BrowserID mechanism OID and the initiator context token ID.</t>
          <t>
The acceptor then verifies the backed identity assertion per the BrowserID specification. This includes validating the expiry times, audience, certificate chain, and assertion signature. The acceptor then verifies the channel binding token, if present, and any other GSS-specific claims in the assertion. In case of failure, a response assertion containing GSS major and minor status codes SHOULD be returned.</t>
          <t>
If the <xref target="RFC3961"/> encryption type for the selected mechanism is not ENCTYPE_NULL, the acceptor generates a ECDH public key using the parameters received from the client (see  <xref target="sub_response_ecdh"/>), and from it derives the RP Response Key (RRK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_RRK"/>). The acceptor then generates a response assertion containing its ECDH public key and context expiration time (note that the context expiration time is a purely informational quantity). The response assertion will be:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
signed in the acceptor's private key, if mutual authentication was requested, and the acceptor has a key (see <xref target="sub_Extensions_for_mutual"/>);</t>
              <t>
signed in the RRK, if the encryption type for the selected mechanism is not ENCTYPE_NULL;</t>

The response assertion is encoded as a backed assertion, prefixed with the acceptor context token ID. It SHALL have a certificate count of zero.</t>
          <t>
Finally, the Context Root Key (CRK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_CRK"/>) is derived from the ECDH shared secret (if present) and GSS_S_COMPLETE is returned, along with the initiator name from the verified assertion. If the CRK is available, the replay_det_state (GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG), sequence_state (GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG), conf_avail (GSS_C_CONF_FLAG) and integ_avail (GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG) security context flags are set to TRUE.</t>
          <t>
Other assertion/certificate properties MAY be made available via GSS_Get_name_attribute().</t>

        <section title="Initiator context completion" anchor="sub_Initiator_context_completion">
          <t>
Upon receiving the acceptor context token, the initiator unpacks the response assertion and, if applicable, computes the ECDH shared secret and RRK. The RRK is used to verify the response assertion unless mutual authentication is available, in which case the acceptor's public key will be used.</t>
          <t>
The initiator sets the context expiry time with that received in the response assertion, if present; otherwise, the context expires when the initiator principal's certificate expires.</t>
          <t>
The CRK is derived from the ECDH shared secret and GSS_S_COMPLETE is returned to indicate the initiator is authenticated and the context is ready for use. No output token is emitted. Security context flags are set as for the acceptor context.</t>

      <section title="Mutual authentication" anchor="sub_Extensions_for_mutual">
        <t>
Mutual authentication allows the acceptor to be authenticated to the initiator. The mechanism SHALL set the mutual_state security context flag (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) to TRUE if mutual authentication succeeded. Support for mutual authentication is OPTIONAL.</t>
        <t>
The base protocol is extended as follows to support this:</t>
        <section title="Initiator mutual authentication context token" anchor="d1e1470">
          <t>
If the initiator requested the mutual_state flag, a nonce (see  <xref target="sub_request_nonce"/>) is included in the assertion to bind the initiator and acceptor tokens. The presence of a nonce in a certificate-signed assertion indicates that mutual authentication is desired.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Acceptor mutual authentication context token" anchor="d1e1482">
          <t>
If the acceptor has a private key and certificate available and received a nonce in the initiator assertion, it signs the response using a private key rather than the RP Response Key (RRK). The response includes the nonce from the initiator's assertion, to bind the two.</t>
          <t>
While the response is a backed assertion, in order to take advantage of existing keying infrastructures BrowserID certificates MUST NOT be included in the backed assertion. Rather, an X.509 certificate SHALL be included as a value for the "x5c" header property in the assertion (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature"/> 4.1.6). The certificate MUST be valid for signing.</t>
          <t>
            <cref>
We don't want to burden the initiator with having to implement both methods of authenticating acceptors, and given that initiators and acceptors both will generally need a PKIX implementation, and given that acceptors will need a PKIX credential for TLS, and that there is as yet no standard protocol for automatic provisioning of BrowserID credentials for servers, using PKIX to authenticate the server seems to be the easiest way to go.</cref>

The initiator verifies the assertion signature and that the nonce matches, and validates the certificate chain. Trust anchors SHOULD be configurable both system-wide and specifically for the BrowserID mechanism.</t>

If the initiator policy requires the acceptor service name to be validated in addition to the acceptor host name, the service name MUST be validated against one of the following:</t>

          <t>
If the initiator policy only requires the acceptor host name to be authenticated, or an EKU binding is used (rather than the id-pkinit-san or URI SAN, which contain a host name), then the host component of the service name (service-host) MUST be present as a value for the dNSName SAN or as the least significant Common Name RDN. </t>

        <t>
Fast re-authentication allows a security context to be established using a secret key derived from the initial certificate-signed ECDH key agreement.</t>
        <t>
The re-authentication assertion is signed with a HMAC using the Authenticator Root Key (ARK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_ARK"/>), rather than a initiator principal's BrowserID certificate.</t>
        <t>
Support for fast re-authentication is OPTIONAL and is indicated by the acceptor returning a ticket in the response assertion.</t>
        <section title="Ticket generation" anchor="d1e1626">
          <t>
If the acceptor supports re-authentication, the following steps are added to  <xref target="sub_Acceptor_context_token"/>:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
A unique, opaque ticket identifier is generated.</t>
              <t>
The acceptor creates a JSON object containing the ticket identifier and expiry time and returns it in the response to the initiator (see  <xref target="sub_response_tkt"/>).</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
The acceptor must be able to use the ticket identifier to securely retrieve the subject, issuer, audience, expiry time, ARK and any other relevant properties of the original security context. One implementation choice may be to use the ticket identifier as a key into a dictionary containing this information. Another would be to encrypt this information in a long-term secret only known to the acceptor and encode the resulting cipher-text in the opaque ticket identifier.</t>
          <t>
The ticket expiry time by default SHOULD match the initiator's certificate expiry, however it MAY be configurable so the ticket expires before or after the certificate.</t>
          <t>
The initiator MAY cache tickets, along with the ARK, received from the acceptor in order to re-authenticate to it at a future time.</t>

        <section title="Initiator re-authentication context token" anchor="d1e1658">

The initiator looks in its ticket cache for an unexpired ticket for the desired acceptor. If none is found, the normal certificate-based authentication flow is performed, otherwise:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
The initiator generates a re-authentication assertion containing: the name of the acceptor (see  <xref target="sub_request_aud"/>), an expiry time (see  <xref target="sub_request_exp"/>) and/or the current time (see  <xref target="sub_request_iat"/>), optional channel binding information (see  <xref target="sub_request_cbt"/>), a random nonce (see  <xref target="sub_request_nonce"/>), and the ticket identifier (see  <xref target="sub_request_tkt"/>).</t>

The initiator signs the re-authentication assertion with the ARK, using the hash algorithm associated with the original context key (see  <xref target="sub_OID_Registry"/>; HS256 is specified for the encryption types referenced in this document).</t>

The re-authentication assertion is packed into a backed assertion. The certificate count is zero as the assertion is signed with an established symmetric key.</t>

The initiator generates an Authenticator Session Key (ASK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_ASK"/>) which is used to verify the response and derive the CRK.</t>

The acceptor validates that the ticket and re-authentication assertion have not expired.</t>

The acceptor generates a response and signs and returns it. Note that, unlike the certificate-based mutual authentication case, the nonce need not be echoed back as the ASK (and thus the RRK) is cryptographically bound to the nonce.</t>

If the ticket cannot be found, or the authentication fails, the acceptor SHOULD return a REAUTH_FAILED error, permitting the initiator to recover and fallback to generating a BrowserID assertion.

The mutual authentication state of a re-authenticated context is transitive. The initiator MUST NOT set the mutual_state flag for a re-authenticated context unless the original context was mutually authenticated.</t>

        <t>
The extra round-trip (XRT) option adds an additional round trip to the context token exchange. It allows the initiator to prove knowledge of the Context Master Key (CMK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_CMK"/>) by sending an additional token signed in a key derived from the CMK and an acceptor-issued challenge. Support for the XRT option is OPTIONAL in the acceptor and REQUIRED in the initiator. The initiator is allowed to not request it, but MUST perform XRT if the acceptor requires it.</t>
        <t>
(Note that the term “extra round trip” is something of a misnomer; it only adds an additional token to the context token exchange. It is anticipated however that this mechanism will most commonly be used with pseudo-mechanisms or application protocols that require an even number of tokens.)</t>
        <section title="Initiator XRT advertisement" anchor="d1e1784">
          <t>
The initiator may advertise to the acceptor that it desires the XRT option by sending in its request assertion an “opts” claim (see  <xref target="sub_request_opts"/>) containing the “xrt” value. This option MUST be set if the caller requested GSS_C_DCE_STYLE (see <xref target="RFC4757"/>). Otherwise, the setting of this option is implementation dependent.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Acceptor XRT advertisement" anchor="d1e1802">

If the initiator requested the XRT option and the acceptor supports it, or the acceptor requires it, the acceptor sends a “jti” claim (see  <xref target="sub_response_jti"/>) in the response assertion containing a random base 64 URL encoded value. This value MUST be at least 64 bits in length. The acceptor then returns GSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED to indicate that an additional context token is expected from the initiator.</t>

      <section title="Response (acceptor/RP) assertion" anchor="d1e2222">
        <t>
The response assertion is sent from the acceptor to the initiator to provide key agreement, and either key confirmation or mutual authentication. It is formatted as a backed assertion, however in the current specification it consists of a single assertion with zero certificates; that is, it is "unbacked". (It is encoded as a backed assertion in order to provide future support for mutual authentication using native BrowserID certificates. Such support is not specified here.)</t>
        <t>
In the case of a key successfully being negotiated, the response assertion is signed with the RP Response Key (RRK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_RRK"/>). Alternatively, it may be signed with the acceptor's private RSA or DSA key. In this case, the acceptor's X.509 certificate is included in the "x5c" property of the JWT header.</t>
        <t>
The HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) algorithm MUST be supported by implementors of this specification.</t>
        <t>
If the <xref target="RFC3961"/> encryption type for the mechanism is ENCTYPE_NULL, then the signature is absent and the value of the "alg" header claim is "none". No signature verification is required in this case.</t>
        <t>
Claims not specified here MUST be ignored by the initiator.</t>
        <t>
Here is an example response assertion:</t>

          <t>
The current acceptor time, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970. This allows the initiator to compensate for clock differences when generating assertions. This claim is OPTIONAL.</t>

This contains a JSON object containing the coordinates of the acceptor's ECDH public key: "x" contains the X coordinate and "y" the Y coordinate (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token"/> Section 5.2). This claim is REQUIRED unless the associated encryption type is ENCTYPE_NULL, or there is already an established session key, as is the case for re-authentication assertions.</t>
          <t>
The “crv” property MUST NOT be present; it is determined by the initiator.</t>

          <t>
This contains the time when the context expires, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970. This claim is OPTIONAL; the initiator should use the certificate or ticket expiry time if absent.</t>

          <t>
The nonce as received from the initiator. This MUST NOT be present unless a nonce was received from the initiator, and the acceptor is signing the assertion with a private key.</t>

        <section title="“tkt” (Ticket)" anchor="sub_response_tkt">
          <t>
This contains a JSON object that may be used for re-authenticating to the acceptor without acquiring an assertion. Its usage is optional. It has two properties: “jti”, an opaque identifier to be presented in a re-authentication assertion; and “exp”, the expiry time of the ticket. This claim is OPTIONAL.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="”jti” (JWT ID)" anchor="sub_response_jti">
          <t>
This contains a base64 URL encoded random value of at least 64 bits that is used to uniquely identify the acceptor response, in the case that the extra round trip option is used. It SHOULD not be present unless the initiator requested the extra round trip option.</t>

      <section title="Error (acceptor/RP) assertion" anchor="d1e2341">
        <t>
Error assertions are backed assertions containing any or all of the following claims. In addition, they MUST have the “iat” claim, for initiator clock skew correction. All other response assertion claims are OPTIONAL or not applicable in error assertions. Conversely, the claims listed below MUST NOT be present in a non-error response assertion.</t>
        <t>
The error assertion MAY be signed if a key is available, otherwise the signature is absent and the value of the "alg" header claim is "none".</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="d1e3328">
      <t>
This document defines a GSS-API security mechanism, and therefore deals in security and has security considerations text embedded throughout. This section only addresses security considerations associated with the BrowserID GSS mechanism described in this document. It does not address security considerations associated with the BrowserID protocol or the GSS-API themselves.</t>
      <t>
This mechanism provides for authentication of initiator principals using private keys to public key crypto-systems, using the BrowserID specification for user certificates (which are NOT PKIX <xref target="RFC5280"/> certificates). Authentication of the acceptor principal is optional. Fast re-authentication is supported via acceptor-issued fast re-authentication tickets.</t>
      <t>
All cryptography for per-message tokens is imported from the Kerberos GSS-API mechanism <xref target="RFC4121"/>.</t>
      <t>
This mechanism actually has several mechanism OIDs, composed of a prefix identifying this family of mechanisms followed by an arc identifying the <xref target="RFC3961"/> encryption type for use with per-message tokens and the GSS_Pseudo_random() function. The NULL encryption type is supported, and when it is used then the GSS-API per-message tokens and GSS_Pseudo_random() function are not available, but channel binding and mutual authentication may be available. Also, when using the NULL encryption type the fast re-authentication feature is not available because key exchange is only performed the initiator application uses the variant of this mechanism that supports per-message tokens and the GSS_Pseudo_random() function.</t>
      <t>
Acceptor credentials are PKIX <xref target="RFC5280"/> certificates and their private keys.</t>
      <section title="Host certificates for mutual authentication" anchor="d1e3374">
        <t>
Allowing a match on only the DNS subjectAltName in an acceptor's X.509 certificate permits different services on the same host to impersonate each other. This should be subject to local policy.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Error statuses" anchor="d1e3383">
        <t>
Returning rich error information in the clear (see  <xref target="sub_response_gss_min"/>) may leak information. Implementations may squash status codes and/or avoid returning minor statuses entirely. Indeed, applications may even not send back error tokens at all, instead closing the connection or whatever might be appropriate for the application. (This is a generic GSS-API security consideration.)</t>

Note: This mechanism describes the GSS BrowserID mechanism used with the aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 encryption type. The GSS-API OID for this mechanism is 1.3.6.1.4.1.5322.24.1.17. As described in RFC 5801 a PLUS variant of this mechanism is also required.</t>
        <t>
          <cref>
We could use the NULL encryption type variant for SASL, as the GS2 bridge does not use message protection services. However, because that mechanisms is unkeyed, re-authentication would not be available. Defining a single AES128 mechanism is consistent with GSS EAP.</cref>

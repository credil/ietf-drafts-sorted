      <t>
This document defines protocols, procedures and conventions for a Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) security mechanism based on the BrowserID authentication mechanism. Through the GS2 family of mechanisms defined in RFC 5801, these protocols also define how Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC 4422) applications may use BrowserID.</t>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction" anchor="d1e808">
      <t><xref target="BrowserID"/> is a web-based three-party security protocol by which user agents can present to a Relying Party (RP) a signed assertion of e-mail address ownership. BrowserID was intended to be used for web authentication. We find BrowserID to be useful in general, therefore we define herein how to use it in many more applications.</t>
      <t>
The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) <xref target="RFC4422"/> is a framework for providing authentication and message protection services via pluggable mechanisms. Protocols that support it include IMAP, SMTP, and XMPP.</t>
      <t>
The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) <xref target="RFC2743"/> provides a framework for authentication and message protection services through a common programming interface. This document conforms to the SASL and GSS-API bridge specified in <xref target="RFC5801"/>, so it defines both a SASL and GSS-API mechanism.</t>
      <t>
The BrowserID mechanism described in this document reuses the existing web-based BrowserID protocol, but profiles it for use in applications that support SASL or GSS-API, adding features such as key agreement, mutual authentication, and fast re-authentication.</t>
      <t>
The following diagram illustrates the interactions between the three parties in the GSS BrowserID protocol. Note that the terms client, initiator and user agent (UA) are used interchangeably in this document, as are server, acceptor and relying party (RP). </t>

      <section title="Discovery and Negotiation" anchor="d1e876">
        <t>
The means of discovering GSS-API peers and their supported mechanisms is out of this specification's scope. They may use SASL <xref target="RFC4422"/> or the Simple and Protected Negotiation mechanism (SPNEGO) <xref target="RFC4178"/>.</t>
        <t>
Discovery of a BrowserID identity provider (IdP) for a user is described in the BrowserID specification. A domain publishes a document containing their public key and URIs for authenticating and provisioning users, or pointer to an authority containing such a document.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Authentication" anchor="d1e900">
        <t>
The GSS-API protocol involves a client, known as the initiator, sending an initial security context token of a chosen GSS-API security mechanism to a peer, known as the acceptor. The two peers subsequently exchange, synchronously, as many security context tokens as necessary to complete the authentication or fail. The specific number of context tokens exchanged varies by security mechanism: in the case of the BrowserID mechanism, it is typically two (i.e. a single round trip), however it can be more in some cases. Once authentication is complete, the initiator and acceptor share a security context which identifies the peers and can optionally be used for integrity or confidentiality protecting subsequent application messages.</t>
        <t>
The original BrowserID protocol, as defined outside this document, specifies a bearer token authentication protocol for web applications. The user agent generates a short-term key pair, the public key of which is signed by the user's IdP. (The user must have already authenticated to the IdP; how this is done is not specified by BrowserID, but forms-based authentication is common.) The IdP returns a certificate for the user which may be cached by the user's browser. When authenticating to a Relying Party (RP), the browser generates an identity assertion containing the RP domain and an expiration time. The user agent signs this and presents both the assertion and certificate to the RP. (The combination of an assertion and zero or more certificates is termed a “backed assertion”.) The RP fetches the public key for the IdP, validates the user's certificate (and those of any intermediate certifying parties) and then verifies the assertion.</t>
        <t>
The GSS BrowserID protocol extends this by having the RP always send back a response to the user agent, which at a minimum provides key confirmation (this is needed for some key agreement methods) and indicates the lifetime of the established security context. The key confirmation token is also required for mutual authentication, when the initiator application requests that feature.</t>

    <section title="Naming" anchor="d1e962">
      <t>
The GSS-API provides a rich security principal naming model. At its most basic the query forms of names consist of a user-entered/displayable string and a “name-type”. Name-types are constants with names prefixed with “GSS_C_NT_” in the GSS-API. Names may also have attributes <xref target="RFC6680"/>.</t>

The BrowserID GSS-API mechanism performs no name canonicalization. The mechanism's GSS_Canonicalize_name() returns an MN whose display form is the same as the query form. Of course, the principal named obtained from a CREDENTIAL HANDLE may be canonical in that the IdP might only issue credentials for canonical names, but credential acquisition is out of scope here.</t>

          <t>
The initial context token is framed per Section 1 of <xref target="RFC2743"/>:</t>

          <t>
Unlike many other GSS-API mechanisms such as Kerberos, this token framing is not used by subsequent context or <xref target="I-D.zhu-negoex"/> metadata tokens. As such, pure SASL implementations of this mechanism do not need to deal with DER encoding the mechanism object identifier.</t>
          <t>
GSS BrowserID is a family of mechanisms, where the last element in the OID arc indicates the <xref target="RFC4121"/> encryption type supported for message protection services. The OID prefix is 1.3.6.1.4.1.5322.24.1. The NULL encryption type is valid, in which case key confirmation and message protection services are not provided.</t>
          <t>
The innerToken consists of the initiator context token ID concatenated with a backed assertion for the audience corresponding to the target name passed into GSS_Init_sec_context(). In addition, the assertion may contain the additional claims, which are described later in this document:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
ECDH key agreement parameters (see  <xref target="sub_request_ecdh"/>)</t>
              <t>
Channel binding information (see  <xref target="sub_request_cbt"/>)</t>
              <t>
A nonce for binding the request to a response signed with a private key for mutual authentication (see  <xref target="sub_request_nonce"/>)</t>
              <t>
A ticket identifier for fast re-authentication using an established session key rather than a BrowserID certificate (see  <xref target="sub_request_tkt"/>)</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
The call to GSS_Init_sec_context() returns GSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED to indicate that a subsequent context token from the acceptor is expected.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Acceptor context token" anchor="sub_Acceptor_context_token">
          <t>
Upon receiving a context token from the initiator, the acceptor validates that the token is well formed and contains a valid BrowserID mechanism OID and the initiator context token ID.</t>
          <t>
The acceptor then verifies the backed identity assertion per the BrowserID specification. This includes validating the expiry times, audience, certificate chain, and assertion signature. The acceptor then verifies the channel binding token, if present, and any other GSS-specific claims in the assertion. In case of failure, a response assertion containing GSS major and minor status codes is returned.</t>
          <t>
If the <xref target="RFC3961"/> encryption type for the selected mechanism is not ENCTYPE_NULL, the acceptor generates a ECDH public key using the parameters received from the client (see  <xref target="sub_response_ecdh"/>), and from it derives the RP Response Key (RRK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_RRK"/>). The acceptor then generates a response assertion containing its ECDH public key and context expiration time (note that the context expiration time is a purely informational quantity). The response assertion is signed using the RP Response Key (RRK) unless mutual authentication is desired, in which case it may be signed in the acceptor's private key (see  <xref target="sub_Extensions_for_mutual"/>).</t>
          <t>
The response assertion is encoded as a backed assertion, prefixed with the acceptor context token ID. It will typically have a certificate count of zero, because the signing key is the symmetric RRK, or because an X.509 certificate is included directly in the assertion's JWT header.</t>
          <t>
Finally, the Context Root Key (CRK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_CRK"/>) is derived from the ECDH shared secret (if present) and GSS_S_COMPLETE is returned, along with the initiator name from the verified assertion. Other assertion/certificate properties MAY be made available via GSS_Get_name_attribute().</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Initiator context completion" anchor="sub_Initiator_context_completion">
          <t>
Upon receiving the acceptor context token, the initiator unpacks the response assertion and, if applicable, computes the ECDH shared secret and RRK. The RRK is used to verify the response assertion unless mutual authentication is available, in which case the acceptor's public key will be used.</t>
          <t>
The initiator sets the context expiry time with that received in the response assertion, if present; otherwise, the context expires when the user's certificate expires.</t>
          <t>
The CRK is derived from the ECDH shared secret and GSS_S_COMPLETE is returned to indicate the user is authenticated and the context is ready for use. No output token is emitted.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Mutual authentication" anchor="sub_Extensions_for_mutual">
        <t>
Mutual authentication allows the acceptor to be authenticated to the initiator. The mechanism SHALL set the returned mutual_state flag (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) to TRUE if mutual authentication succeeded. Support for mutual authentication is OPTIONAL.</t>
        <t>
The base protocol is extended as follows to support this:</t>
        <section title="Initiator mutual authentication context token" anchor="d1e1424">
          <t>
If the initiator requested the mutual_state flag, a nonce (see  <xref target="sub_request_nonce"/>) is included in the assertion to bind the initiator and acceptor tokens. The presence of a nonce in a certificate-signed assertion indicates that mutual authentication is desired.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Acceptor mutual authentication context token" anchor="d1e1436">
          <t>
If the acceptor has a private key and certificate available and received a nonce in the initiator assertion, it signs the response using a private key rather than the RP Response Key (RRK). The response includes the nonce from the initiator's assertion, to bind the two.</t>
          <t>
While the response is a backed assertion, in order to take advantage of existing keying infrastructures BrowserID certificates SHOULD NOT be included in the backed assertion.

      <section title="Fast re-authentication" anchor="sub_Fast_re_authentication">
        <t>
Fast re-authentication allows a security context to be established using a secret key derived from the initial certificate-signed ECDH key agreement.</t>
        <t>
The re-authentication assertion is signed with a HMAC using the Authenticator Root Key (ARK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_ARK"/>), rather than a user's BrowserID certificate.</t>
        <t>
Support for fast re-authentication is OPTIONAL and is indicated by the acceptor returning a ticket in the response assertion.</t>
        <section title="Ticket generation" anchor="d1e1547">
          <t>
If the acceptor supports re-authentication, the following steps are added to  <xref target="sub_Acceptor_context_token"/>:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
A unique, opaque ticket identifier is generated.</t>
              <t>
The acceptor creates a JSON object containing the ticket identifier and expiry time and returns it in the response to the initiator (see  <xref target="sub_response_tkt"/>).</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
The acceptor must be able to use the ticket identifier to securely retrieve the subject, issuer, audience, expiry time, ARK and any other relevant properties of the original security context. One implementation choice may be to use the ticket identifier as a key into a dictionary containing this information. Another would be to encrypt this information in a long-term secret only known to the acceptor and encode the resulting ciphertext in the opaque ticket identifier.</t>
          <t>
The ticket expiry time by default SHOULD match the initiator's certificate expiry, however it MAY be configurable so the ticket expires before or after the certificate.</t>
          <t>
The initiator MAY cache tickets, along with the ARK, received from the acceptor in order to re-authenticate to it at a future time.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Initiator re-authentication context token" anchor="d1e1579">
          <t>
The initiator looks in its ticket cache for an unexpired ticket for the desired acceptor. If none is found, the normal certificate-based authentication flow is performed, otherwise:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
The initiator generates a re-authentication assertion containing: the name of the acceptor (see  <xref target="sub_request_aud"/>), an expiry time (see  <xref target="sub_request_exp"/>) and/or the current time (see  <xref target="sub_request_iat"/>), optional channel binding information (see  <xref target="sub_request_cbt"/>), a random nonce (see  <xref target="sub_request_nonce"/>), and the ticket identifier (see  <xref target="sub_request_tkt"/>).</t>
              <t>
The initiator signs the re-authentication assertion with the ARK, using the hash algorithm associated with the original context key (see  <xref target="sub_OID_Registry"/>; HS256 is specified for the encryption types referenced in this document).</t>
              <t>
The re-authentication assertion is packed into a backed assertion. The certificate count is zero as the assertion is signed with an established symmetric key.</t>
              <t>
The initiator generates an Authenticator Session Key (ASK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_ASK"/>) which is used to verify the response and derive the CRK.</t>

              <t>
The acceptor unpacks the re-authentication assertion and retrieves the ARK, ticket expiry time, mutual authentication state and any other properties (such as the initiator name) associated with the ticket identifier.</t>
              <t>
The acceptor validates that the ticket and re-authentication assertion have not expired.</t>
              <t>
The acceptor verifies the assertion using the ARK.</t>
              <t>
The acceptor generates the ASK (see  <xref target="sub_kd_ASK"/>) and derives the RRK and CRK from this (see  <xref target="sub_kd_RRK"/> and  <xref target="sub_kd_CRK"/>, respectively).</t>
              <t>
The acceptor generates a response and signs and returns it. Note that, unlike the certificate-based mutual authentication case, the nonce need not be echoed back as the ASK (and thus the RRK) is cryptographically bound to the nonce.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
If the ticket cannot be found, or the authentication fails, the acceptor SHOULD return a REAUTH_FAILED error, permitting the initiator to recover and fallback to generating a BrowserID assertion. It MAY also include its local timestamp (see  <xref target="sub_response_iat"/>) so that the initiator can perform clock skew compensation.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Interaction with mutual authentication" anchor="d1e1664">
          <t>
The mutual authentication state of a re-authenticated context is transitive. The initiator MUST NOT set the mutual_state flag for a re-authenticated context unless the original context was mutually authenticated.</t>
          <t>
As such, the initiator's ticket cache must store the mutual authentication state of the original context.</t>

        <section title="Ticket renewal" anchor="d1e1676">
          <t>
Normally, re-authentication tickets are only issued when the initiator authenticated with a certificate-signed assertion.

The issuing of new tickets MUST be subject to a policy that prevents them from being renewed indefinitely.</t>

      <section title="Extra round-trip (XRT) option" anchor="sub_XRT_option">
        <t>
The extra round-trip (XRT) option adds an additional round trip to the context token exchange. It allows the initiator to prove knowledge of the Context Master Key (CMK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_CMK"/>) by sending an additional token signed in a key derived from the CMK and an acceptor-issued challenge. Support for the XRT option is OPTIONAL. (Note that the term “extra round trip” is something of a misnomer; it only adds an additional leg to the context token exchange. It is anticipated however that this mechanism will most commonly be used with pseudo-mechanisms or application protocols that require an even number of legs.)</t>
        <section title="Initiator XRT advertisement" anchor="d1e1699">
          <t>
The initiator advertises to the acceptor that it supports the XRT option by sending in its request assertion an “opts” claim (see  <xref target="sub_request_opts"/>) containing the “xrt” value. This option MUST be set if the caller requested GSS_C_DCE_STYLE (see <xref target="RFC4757"/>). Otherwise, the setting of this option is implementation dependent.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Acceptor XRT advertisement" anchor="d1e1717">
          <t>
If the initiator advertised support for the XRT option, and the acceptor also supports this option, the acceptor sends a “jti” claim (see  <xref target="sub_response_jti"/>) in the response assertion, containing a random base 64 URL encoded value. This value SHOULD be at least 64 bits in length. (This top-level “jti” claim is unrelated to the “nonce” claim or to the “jti” ticket identifier claim.) The acceptor then returns GSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED to indicate that an additional context token is expected from the initiator.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Initiator XRT context token" anchor="d1e1730">
          <t>
If the initiator requested the XRT option and the acceptor indicated support for it by including a “jti” claim in its response, then the initiator sends an additional context token to the acceptor. This token contains the initiator context token ID concatenated with a backed assertion with zero certificates and an empty payload, signed using the XRTK (see  <xref target="sub_kd_XRTK"/>).</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Acceptor XRT context token validation" anchor="d1e1742">
          <t>
The acceptor MUST validate the XRT context token by first validating the context token ID, and then verifying the assertion signature with the XRTK. The acceptor SHOULD reject XRT context tokens with a certificate count greater than zero. Unknown claims in the assertion payload MUST be ignored. The acceptor then returns GSS_C_COMPLETE to the caller.</t>

The acceptor MAY avoid using a replay cache when this option is in effect.</t>

        <section title="Interaction with message protection services" anchor="d1e1754">
          <t>
When the XRT option is in effect, the XRTK is used instead of the CMK to derive the Context Root Key (CRK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_CRK"/>). Per-message tokens MUST have the AcceptorSubkey flag set (see <xref target="RFC4121"/> Section 4.2.2).</t>

The expiry and, if present, issued-at and not-before times of all elements in a backed assertion, MUST be validated. This applies equally to re-authentication assertions, public key assertions, and the entire certificate chain.

The response assertion is sent from the acceptor to the initiator to provide key agreement, and either key confirmation or mutual authentication. It is formatted as a backed assertion, however in the current specification it consists of a single assertion with zero certificates; that is, it is "unbacked". (It is encoded as a backed assertion in order to provide future support for mutual authentication using native BrowserID certificates. Such support is not specified here; implementations of this version of the specification MAY reject response assertions with BrowserID certificates.)</t>
        <t>
In the case of a key successfully being negotiated, the response assertion is signed with the RP Response Key (RRK) (see  <xref target="sub_kd_RRK"/>). Alternatively, it may be signed with the acceptor's private RSA or DSA key. In this case, the acceptor's X.509 certificate is included in the "x5c" property of the JWT header.</t>

If a key is unavailable, then the signature is absent and the value of the "alg" header claim is "none". No signature verification is required in this case, however the initiator MUST NOT return GSS_C_COMPLETE unless the <xref target="RFC3961"/> encryption type for the mechanism is ENCTYPE_NULL.</t>

This contains a GSS minor status code represented as a number. It MUST NOT be present if the acceptor did not return an error and MUST NOT be present if there is no minor status code for the given major error. This claim is OPTIONAL.</t>
          <t>
If REAUTH_FAILED is received, the initiator SHOULD attempt to send another initial context token containing a fresh assertion.</t>
          <t>
The following protocol minor status codes are defined. Note that the API representation of these status codes is implementation dependent. Status codes with the high bit set are GSS BrowserID protocol errors; the remainder are BrowserID protocol errors.</t>

    <section title="Key derivation" anchor="d1e2929">
      <t>
The following function is used as the base algorithm for deriving keys:</t>
      <t>
browserid-derive-key(K, salt) = HMAC(K, "BrowserID" || K || salt || 0x01)</t>
      <t>
The HMAC hash algorithm for all currently specified key lengths is SHA-256. Note that the inclusion of K in the HMAC input is for interoperability with some crypto implementations.</t>
      <section title="Diffie-Hellman Key (DHK)" anchor="sub_kd_DHK">
        <t>
This key is the shared secret resulting from the ECDH exchange. Its length corresponds to the selected EC curve. It is never used without derivation and thus may be used with implementations that do not expose the ECDH value directly.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Context Master Key (CMK)" anchor="sub_kd_CMK">
        <t>
This is the Diffie-Hellman Key (DHK) for all initially authenticated contexts and the Authenticator Session Key (ASK) for re-authenticated contexts.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Context Root Key (CRK)" anchor="sub_kd_CRK">
        <t>
The Context Root Key is used for <xref target="RFC4121"/> message protection services, e.g. GSS_Wrap() and GSS_Get_MIC(). If the extra round-trip option is in effect, it is derived as follows:</t>
        <t>
CRK = random-to-key(browserid-derive-key(XRTK, "CRK"))</t>
        <t>
Otherwise, the CMK is used:</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Authenticator Root Key (ARK)" anchor="sub_kd_ARK">
        <t>
The Authenticator Root Key (ARK) is used to sign assertions used for fast re-authentication. (The term “authenticator” is equivalent to “re-authentication assertion” and exists for historical reasons.) It is derived as follows:</t>
        <t>
ARK = browserid-derive-key(CMK, "ARK")</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Authenticator Session Key (ASK)" anchor="sub_kd_ASK">
        <t>
The Authenticator Session Key (ASK) is used instead of the DHK for re-authenticated contexts. It is derived as follows:</t>
        <t>
ASK = browserid-derive-key(ARK, reauth-assertion-as-jwt)</t>
        <t>
The salt (reauth-assertion-as-jwt) is the JWT encoding of the re-authentication assertion as sent by the initiator. This binds the nonce to the session key.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Extra Round Trip Key (XRTK)" anchor="sub_kd_XRTK">
        <t>
The Extra Round Trip Key (XRTK) is used to sign the extra round trip token, and also as the master key for the CRK when the extra round trip option is used.</t>
        <t>
XRTK = browserid-derive-key(CMK, acceptor-jti-binary)</t>
        <t>
The salt (acceptor-jti-binary) is the base64 URL decoding of the acceptor JWT ID claim.</t>

      <section title="GSS Pseudo-Random Function (PRF)" anchor="sub_GSS_PRF">
        <t>
The BrowserID mechanism shares the same Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) as the Kerberos GSS mechanism, defined in <xref target="RFC4402"/>. GSS_C_PRF_KEY_FULL and GSS_C_PRF_KEY_PARTIAL are equivalent. The protocol key to be used for GSS_Pseudo_random() SHALL by the Context Root Key (CRK).</t>

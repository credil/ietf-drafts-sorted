Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS              December 2009


1.  Introduction

   PCEP rfcs [RFC5440], [RFC5521], [RFC5541],[RFC5520] are focused on
   path computation requests in MPLS networks.  [RFC4655] defines the
   PCE framework also for GMPLS networks.  This document complements
   these documents by providing some consideration of GMPLS applications
   and routing requests, for example for OTN and WSON networks.

   The requirements on PCE extensions to support those characteristics
   is described in [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-wson-routing-wavelength].

1.1.  PCEP requirements

   This section provides a set of PCEP requirements to support signal
   compatibility constraints.  When requesting a path computation
   (PCReq) to PCE, the PCC should be able to indicate, according to
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req], the following additional attributes:

      (1) Switching capability: PSC1-4, L2SC, TDM, LSC, FSC

      (2) Encoding type: as defined in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], e.g.,
      Ethernet, SONET/SDH, Lambda, etc.

      (3) Signal Type: Indicates the type of elementary signal that
      constitutes the requested LSP.  A lot of signal types with
      different granularity have been defined in SONET/SDH and G.709
      ODUk, such as VC11, VC12, VC2, VC3 and VC4 in SDH, and ODU1, ODU2
      and ODU3 in G.709 ODUk [RFC4606] and [RFC4328].

      (4) Concatenation Type: In SDH/SONET and G.709 ODUk networks, two
      kinds of concatenation modes are defined: contiguous concatenation
      which requires co-route for each member signal and requires all
      the interfaces along the path to support this capability, and
      virtual concatenation which allows diverse routes for the member
      signals and only requires the ingress and egress interfaces to
      support this capability.  Note that for the virtual concatenation,
      it also may specify co-routed or separated-routed.  See [RFC4606]
      and [RFC4328] about concatenation information.

      (5) Concatenation Number: Indicates the number of signals that are
      requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated.  Also see
      [RFC4606] and [RFC4328].

      (6) Wavelength Label: as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-g-694-lambda-labels]

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS              December 2009


      (7) e2e Path protection type: as defined in [RFC4872], e.g., 1+1
      protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc.

      (8) Link Protection type: as defined in [RFC4203]

   We describe in this document a proposal to fulfill those
   requirements.

1.2.  PCEP existing objects related to GMPLS

   PCEP as of [RFC5440], [RFC5521] and [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext],
   supports the following information (in the PCReq and PCRep) related
   to the described RSVP-TE information.

   From [RFC5440]:

   o  numbered endpoints

   o  bandwidth (float)

   o  ERO

   o  LSP attribute (setup and holding priorities)

   o  Request attribute (include some LSP attributes)

   From [RFC5521]:

   o  Extensions to PCEP for Route Exclusions define a XRO object and a
      new semantic (F bit): Fail bit indicating that the existing route
      is failed and resources present in the RRO can be reused.  This
      object also allows to exclude (strict or not) resources; XRO
      include the diversity level (node, link, SRLG).  The requested
      diversity is expressed in the XRO.

   From [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext]:

   o  INTER-LAYER : indicates if inter-layer computation is allowed

   o  SWITCH-LAYER : indicates which layer(s) should be considered, can
      be used to represent the RSVP-TE generalized label request

   o  REQ-ADAP-CAP : indicates the adaptation capabilities requested,
      can also be used for the endpoints in case of mono-layer
      computation

   The shortcomings of the existing PCEP information are:

      BANDWIDTH does not describe the details of the signal (for example
      NVC, multiplier) in the context of TDM or OTN networks.

      END-POINTS does not allow specifying an unnumbered interface, nor
      the labels on the interface.  Those parameters are of interest in
      case of switching constraints.

   Current attributes do not allow to express the requested link level
   protection and end-to-end protection attributes.

   In order to improve the PCEP, a new object is introduced
   (GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH), a new object type is introduced for the END-
   POINTS object (generalized-unnumbered), and a TLV is added to the
   LSPA object.  In order to allow to restrict the range of labels
   returned, an additional object is added : LABEL SET

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  PCEP objects and extensions

   This section describes the required PCEP objects and extensions.  The
   PCReq/PCRep message is defined in [RFC5440], with extensions
   (GENERALIZED BANDWIDTH and LABEL Set)

2.1.  Traffic parameters encoding, GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH

   The PCEP BANDWIDTH does not describe the details of the signal (for
   example NVC, multiplier), hence the bandwidth information should be
   extended to use the RSVP Tspec.  The PCEP BANDWIDTH object defines
   two types: 1 and 2.  Ctype 2 is representing the existing bandwidth
   in case of re-optimization.

   The following possibilities cannot be represented in the BANDWIDTH
   object:

   o  Asymmetric bandwidth (different bandwidth in forward and reverse
      direction), as described in [RFC5467]

   o  Optical (SDH/SONET, G.709, ATM, MEF etc) parameters are not
      supported.

   We propose to add a new Object named GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH having the
   following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                              Reserved                     |R|O|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |             Traffic Spec                                      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The bits R and O have the following meaning:

      O bit : set when the value refer to the previous bandwidth in case
      of re-optimization

      R bit : set when the value refer to the bandwidth of the reverse
      direction

   The Object type determine which type of bandwidth is represented by
   the object.  The Following object type are defined:

   1.  Intserv

   2.  SONET/SDH

   3.  G.709

   4.  Ethernet MEF (see [I-D.ietf-ccamp-ethernet-traffic-parameters])

   The encoding of the field Traffic Spec is the same as in RSVP-TE, it
   can be found in the following references.

   Object Type  Name        Reference
   2            Intserv     [RFC2210]
   4            SONET/SDH   [RFC4606]
   5            G.709       [RFC4328]
   6 (TBA by    Ethernet    [I-D.ietf-ccamp-ethernet-traffic-parameters]
   IANA)        MEF

                        Traffic Spec field encoding

   The GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH MAY appear more than once in a PCReq
   message.  If more than one GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH have the same Object
   Type, Reserved, R and O values, only the first one is processed, the
   others are ignored.  On the response those objects MAY be included.

2.2.  Endpoints encoding

   In GMPLS context the endpoints can:

   o  Be unnumbered

   o  Have label(s) associated to them

   o  May have different switching capabilities

   The traffic type is expressed in the following objects/type:

   o  Endpoint label types (Enc, switch, gpid),

   o  TSPEC: Signal type

   o  SWITCH layer (enc, switching)

   Only the TSPEC and SWITCH layer need to be coherent, the endpoint
   labels could be different The PCE might know the node internal
   adaptation capabilities, and handle the internal routing, but this is
   not a requirement.  Since the PCEP ENDPOINTS object does not support
   unnumbered endpoints information, a new Ctype is proposed.  In any
   case the unnumbered interface id has to be encoded as an object new
   Ctype.  The proposed format is (generalized unnumbered interface id
   endpoint):

     0                   1                   2                   3

   Label or label range may be specified for the TE-LSP endpoints.
   Those are encoded in the sub-TLVs.  The label value cannot be
   interpreted without a description on the Encoding and switching type.
   The REQ-ADAP-CAP object from [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext] can be
   used in case of mono-layer request, however in case of multilayer it

   is possible to have in the future more than one object, so it is
   better to have a dedicated subtlv for the label (the scope is then
   more clear).  TLVs are encoded as follow (following [RFC5440]) :

      as follow:

   A label subTlv represent the label used on the unnumbered interface,
   bits I and U are used to indicate which exact unnumbered interface/
   direction is considered. the fields are encoded as in the RSVP-TE.
   The Encoding Type indicates the encoding type, e.g., SONET/SDH/GigE

   etc., that will be used with the data associated with the LSP.  The
   Switching type indicates the type of switching that is being
   requested on the link.  G-PID identifies the payload of the TE-LSP.
   The label type indicates which type of label (2) for generalized
   label is carried.  A Label Set Sub-TLV represents a set of possible
   labels that can be used on the unnumbered interface.  The action
   parameter in the Label set indicates the type of list provided.
   Those parameters are described by [RFC3471]

                The I and U bits have the following meaning

   I: Ingress bit, set when the label or label set is applicable to the
      ingress endpoint
   U: Upstream direction : set when the label or label set is in the
      reverse direction

2.3.  LABEL SET object

   The LABEL SET object is carried within a PCReq message to restrict
   the set of labels to be assigned during the routing.  Any label
   included in the ERO object on the response must comply with the
   restrictions stated in the LABEL SET, whose encoding is defined as

   The fields and U bit are as defined in Section 2.2, See also
   [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] for the definitions of the fields.

   It is allowed to have more than one LABEL SET object per PCEReq (for
   example in case of multiple SWITCH-LAYER present).

   In the case of unsuccessful path computation, the PCRep message also
   contains a NO-PATH object, and the LABEL SET object MAY be used to
   indicate the set of constraint that could not be satisfied.

2.4.  LSPA extensions

   The LSPA carries the LSP attributes.  In the end-to-end protection
   context this also includes the protection state information.  The
   LSPA object can be extended by a protection TLV type: Type TBA by
   IANA: protection attribute

   The content is as defined in [RFC4872], [RFC4873].

   LSP Flags can be considered for routing policy based on the
   protection type.  The other attributes are only meaningful for a
   stateful PCE.

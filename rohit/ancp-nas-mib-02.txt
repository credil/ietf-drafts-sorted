Internet-Draft                ANCP NAS MIB                 November 2010


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for managing Network Access Servers (NAS) that are using Access Node
   Control Protocol defined in [ANCPPR]


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Overview

   In [ANCPFW], the framework for the Access Node Control Protocol
   (ANCP) is described.  It defines 2 network entities, the Access Node
   (AN) and the Network Access Server (NAS), between which ANCP sessions
   are established.  The detailed protocol specification of ANCP is
   described in [ANCPPR].  This document specifies a MIB module for a
   Network Access Server that supports ANCP.

   Note: the current MIB definition is specific for [ANCPPR] If [ANCPPR]
   gets updated later, then the MIB definition in this document will
   also follow these changes.


4.  Structure of the MIB Module

4.1.  Textual Conventions

   The following new textual conventions are introduced:
   AncpSessionState, AncpSessionCapabilities, AncpDslLineState, and
   AncpDslLineType.

4.2.  The ANCP NAS MIB Module Subtree

   This document defines mib modules ANCP-NAS-MIB under mib-2.

4.3.  The Notifications Subtree

   Notifications are defined to inform the management station about
   state changes of ANCP sessions and ANCP ports.  The notification
   ancpNasPortUp is to inform the management station when a ANCP Port-Up
   message is received, and ancpNasPortDown is to inform when a ANCP
   Port-Down message is received.  The notification ancpNasSessionUp is
   to inform when a session comes up and ancpNasSessionDown to inform

   session going down.

   To enable and disable the generation of these notifications,
   attributes ancpNasPortStatusNotifEnable and ancpNasSessionNotifEnable
   are defined.  The attribute ancpNasPortStatusNotifEnable controls the
   generation of ancpNasPortUp and ancpNasPortDown, and
   ancpNasPortStatusNotifEnable controls the generation of
   ancpNasSessionUp and ancpNasSessionDown.

4.4.  The Table Structures

   The ANCP MIB module for the NAS has the following tables:

   o  ancpNasIfConfigTable

      This table is used to configure interface specific ANCP parameters
      including neighbors (i.e DSLAMs).  A neighbor is identified with a
      name, ID and a client-ID.  The name is generally the hostname of
      the neighbor, neighbor's IP or MAC can be used as the ID which is
      unique.  The client-ID is the port's identity, or the Access-Loop-
      Circuit-ID which will take a well defined form based on the access
      technology used.  In the case of ATM based local loop, the string
      will be of the form:

         Access-Node-Identifier atm slot/port:vpi.vci

      In case of Ethernet based (and tagged) local loop, the string will
      be of the form:

         Access-Node-Identifier eth slot/port[:vlan-id]

   o  ancpNasSessionTable

      This table shows the operational state of ANCP sessions on the
      NAS.

   o  ancpNasPortTable

      This table shows the ports known to the NAS and their state and
      DSL line parameters.  The ports can be configured or learnt (via
      ANCP Event messages).  Configured ports have a corresponding entry
      in the ancpNasIfConfigTable.

   Following groups are defined:

   o  ancpNasSessionGroup

      This group contains all objects specific to ANCP session.

Internet-Draft                ANCP NAS MIB                 November 2010


   o  ancpNasPortGroup

      This group contains all port specific objects for ANCP.

   o  ancpNasConfigGroup

      This group contains all configurable objects for ANCP.

   o  ancpNasNotifControlGroup

      This group contains the attributes which control the generation of
      ANCP session and port status notifications.

   o  ancpNasNotificationGroup

      This group contains the notifications that indicate state changes
      of ANCP sessions and ports (ancpNasNotifications).


5.  Relationship With Other MIB Modules

   ANCP NAS MIB module uses ifIndex (defined in ifTable of IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]) to index ancpNasIfConfigTable.

5.1.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The ANCP MIB module for Network Access Server requires following MIB
   modules for IMPORTS:

   o  SNMPv2-SMI defined in [RFC2578]

   o  RMON2-MIB defined in [RFC4502]

   o  IF-MIB defined in [RFC2863]

   o  INET-ADDRESS-MIB defined in [RFC4001]

   o  SNMPv2-CONF defined in [RFC2580]

   o  GSMP-MIB defined in [RFC3295]

   o  SNMPv2-TC defined in [RFC2579]

7.  Security Considerations

   Unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause a denial of
   service and/or widespread network disturbance.  Hence, the support
   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These

Internet-Draft                ANCP NAS MIB                 November 2010


   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  ancpNasAdjacencyTimer

      Unauthorized changes to ANCP adjacency timer, like changing the
      adjacency timer to a very small value will increase the adjacency
      protocol messages generated and increase traffic on the NAS port,
      this could impact other traffic on the NAS.

   o  ancpNasIfEnable

      Unauthorized changes to ancpNasIfEnable can result in adverse
      operational effect by enabling ANCP when that was supposed to be
      disabled, or service being made un-available to legitimate users.

   o  ancpNasIfNeighbourName, ancpNasIfID

      Unauthorized changes to ancpNasIfNeighbourName and ancpNasIfID can
      result in a spurious ANCP neighbor (AN) being added or an actual
      neighbor being removed disrupting all ANCP traffic from than AN.

   o  ancpNasIfClientID

      Unauthorized changes to ancpNasIfClientID could result in spurious
      subscribers being added or legitimate subscribers being removed.
      Also ancpNasIfClientID being a unique identity of a port, a change
      to any object may also cause service disruption.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410] , section
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).  Further, deployment of SNMP
   versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is
   RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
   It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/
   create/delete) them.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign OID (marked xxx) under mib-2 for ANCP-
   NAS-MIB.

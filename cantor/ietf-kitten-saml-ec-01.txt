            SAML Enhanced Client SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms
                draft-cantor-ietf-kitten-saml-ec-01.txt

Abstract

   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a generalized
   framework for the exchange of security-related information between
   asserting and relying parties.  Simple Authentication and Security
   Layer (SASL) and the Generic Security Service Application Program
   Interface (GSS-API) are application frameworks to facilitate an
   extensible authentication model.  This document specifies a SASL and
   GSS-API mechanism for SAML 2.0 that leverages the capabilities of a
   SAML-aware "enhanced client" to address significant barriers to
   federated authentication in a manner that encourages reuse of
   existing SAML bindings and profiles designed for non-browser
   scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
   [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] is a modular specification that provides
   various means for a user to be identified to a relying party (RP)
   through the exchange of (typically signed) assertions issued by an
   identity provider (IdP).  It includes a number of protocols, protocol
   bindings [OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os], and interoperability profiles
   [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os] designed for different use cases.
   Additional profiles and extensions are also routinely developed and
   published.

   Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] is a
   generalized mechanism for identifying and authenticating a user and
   for optionally negotiating a security layer for subsequent protocol
   interactions.  SASL is used by application protocols like IMAP, POP
   and XMPP [RFC3920].  The effect is to make authentication modular, so
   that newer authentication mechanisms can be added as needed.

   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] provides a framework for applications to support multiple
   authentication mechanisms through a unified programming interface.
   This document defines a pure SASL mechanism for SAML, but it conforms
   to the bridge between SASL and the GSS-API called GS2 [RFC5801].
   This means that this document defines both a SASL mechanism and a
   GSS-API mechanism.  We want to point out that the GSS-API interface
   is optional for SASL implementers, and the GSS-API considerations can
   be avoided in environments that uses SASL directly without GSS-API.

   The mechanisms specified in this document allow a SASL- or GSS-API-
   enabled server to act as a SAML relying party, or service provider
   (SP), by advertising this mechanism as an option for SASL or GSS-API
   clients that support the use of SAML to communicate identity and
   attribute information.  Clients supporting this mechanism are termed
   "enhanced clients" in SAML terminology because they understand the
   federated authentication model and have specific knowledge of the
   IdP(s) associated with the user.  This knowledge, and the ability to
   act on it, addresses a significant problem with browser-based SAML
   profiles known as the "discovery", or "where are you from?"  (WAYF)
   problem.  Obviating the need for the RP to interact with the client
   to determine the right IdP (and its network location) is both a user
   interface and security improvement.

   The SAML mechanism described in this document is an adaptation of an
   existing SAML profile, the Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) Profile
   (V2.0) [SAMLECP20], and therefore does not establish a separate
   authentication, integrity and confidentiality mechanism.  It is
   anticipated that existing security layers, such as Transport Layer

   Security (TLS), will continued to be used.

   Figure 1 describes the interworking between SAML and SASL: this
   document requires enhancements to the RP and to the client (as the
   two SASL communication endpoints) but no changes to the SAML IdP are
   assumed apart from its support for the applicable SAML profile.  To
   accomplish this, a SAML protocol exchange between the RP and the IdP,
   brokered by the client, is tunneled within SASL.  There is no assumed
   communication between the RP and the IdP, but such communication may
   occur in conjunction with additional SAML-related profiles not in
   scope for this document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The reader is also assumed to be familiar with the terms used in the
   SAML 2.0 specification, and an understanding of the Enhanced Client
   or Proxy (ECP) Profile (V2.0) [SAMLECP20] is necessary, as part of
   this mechanism explicitly reuses and references it.

   This document can be implemented without knowledge of GSS-API since
   the normative aspects of the GS2 protocol syntax have been duplicated
   in this document.  The document may also be implemented to provide a
   GSS-API mechanism, and then knowledge of GSS-API is essential.  To
   faciliate these two variants, the references has been split into two
   parts, one part that provides normative references for all readers,
   and one part that adds additional normative references required for
   implementers that wish to implement the GSS-API portion.

3.  Applicability for Non-HTTP Use Cases

   While SAML is designed to support a variety of application scenarios,
   the profiles for authentication defined in the original standard are
   designed around HTTP [RFC2616] applications.  They are not, however,
   limited to browsers, because it was recognized that browsers suffer
   from a variety of functional and security deficiencies that would be
   useful to avoid where possible.  Specifically, the notion of an
   "Enhanced Client" (or a proxy acting as one on behalf of a browser,
   thus the term "ECP") was specified for a software component that
   acted somewhat like a browser from an application perspective, but
   included limited, but sufficient, awareness of SAML to play a more
   conscious role in the authentication exchange between the RP and the
   IdP.  What follows is an outline of the Enhanced Client or Proxy
   (ECP) Profile (V2.0) [SAMLECP20], as applied to the web/HTTP service
   use case:

   1.  The Enhanced Client requests a resource of a Relying Party (RP)
       (via an HTTP request).  In doing so, it advertises its "enhanced"
       capability using HTTP headers.

   2.  The RP, desiring SAML authentication and noting the client's
       capabilities, responds not with an HTTP redirect or form, but
       with a SOAP [W3C.soap11] envelope containing a SAML
       <AuthnRequest> along with some supporting headers.  This request
       identifies the RP (and may be signed), and may provide hints to
       the client as to what IdPs the RP finds acceptable, but the
       choice of IdP is generally left to the client.

   3.  The client is then responsible for delivering the body of the
       SOAP message in a new envelope to the IdP it is instructed to use
       (often via configuration ahead of time).  The user authenticates
       to the IdP ahead of, during, or after the delivery of this
       message, and perhaps explicitly authorizes the response to the
       RP.

   4.  Whether authentication succeeds or fails, the IdP responds with
       its own SOAP envelope, generally containing a SAML <Response>
       message for delivery to the RP.  In a successful case, the
       message will include a SAML <Assertion> containing
       authentication, and possibly attribute, information about the
       user.  Either the response or assertion alone is signed, and the
       assertion may be encrypted to a key negotiated with or known to
       belong to the RP.

   5.  The client then delivers a new SOAP envelope containing the
       <Response> to the RP at a location the IdP directs (which acts as
       an additional, though limited, defense against MITM attacks).

Internet-Draft     SAML ECP SASL & GSS-API Mechanisms         March 2011


       This completes the SAML exchange.

   6.  The RP now has sufficient identity information to approve the
       original HTTP request or not, and acts accordingly.  Everything
       between the original request and this response can be thought of
       as an "interruption" of the original HTTP exchange.

   When considering this flow in the context of an arbitrary application
   protocol and SASL, the RP and the client both must change their code
   to implement this SASL mechanism, but the IdP can remain untouched.
   The existing RP/client exchange that is tunneled through HTTP maps
   well to the tunneling of that same exchange in SASL.  In the parlance
   of SASL [RFC4422], this mechanism is "client-first" for consistency
   with GS2.  The client may accompany its "initial response" with a
   SAML <Response> obtained from an IdP.  The steps are shown below:

   1.  The server MAY advertise the SAML20EC and/or SAML20EC-PLUS
       mechanisms.

   2.  The client initiates a SASL authentication with SAML20EC or
       SAML20EC-PLUS.  It MAY include a SAML <Response>.

   3.  The server sends the client one of two responses:

       1.  an indication of success or failure (if the client included a
           SAML <Response>).

       2.  a challenge containing a SOAP envelope containing a SAML
           <AuthnRequest>.

   4.  In the latter case, the SASL client unpacks the SOAP message and
       communicates with its chosen IdP to relay the SAML <AuthnRequest>
       to it.  This communication, and the authentication with the IdP,
       proceeds separately from the SASL process.

   5.  Upon completion of the exchange with the IdP, the client responds
       to the SASL server with a SOAP envelope containing the SAML
       <Response> it obtained, or a SOAP fault, as warranted.

   6.  The SASL Server indicates success or failure.

   Note: The details of the SAML processing, which are consistent with
   the Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) Profile (V2.0) [SAMLECP20], are
   such that the client MUST interact with the IdP in order to complete
   any SASL exchange with the RP.  The assertions issued by the IdP for
   the purposes of the profile, and by extension this SASL mechanism,
   are short lived, and therefore cannot be cached by the client for
   later use.

   Encompassed in step four is the client-driven selection of the IdP,
   authentication to it, and the acquisition of a response to provide to
   the SASL server.  These processes are all external to SASL.

   With all of this in mind, the typical flow appears as follows:

4.  SAML SASL Mechanism Specification

   Based on the previous figures, the following operations are defined
   by the SAML SASL mechanism:

4.1.  Advertisement

   To advertise that a server supports this mechanism, during
   application session initiation, it displays the name "SAML20EC"
   and/or "SAML20EC-PLUS" in the list of supported SASL mechanisms
   (depending on its support for channel binding).

4.2.  Initiation

   A client initiates "SAML20EC" or "SAML20EC-PLUS" authentication.  If
   supported by the application protocol, the client MAY include an
   initial response, otherwise it waits until the server has issued an
   empty challenge (because the mechanism is client-first).

   The format of the initial client response is as follows:

    saml-response = *%x00-FF

    initial-response = gs2-cb-flag "," [gs2-authzid] "," [saml-response]

   If the "saml-response" token is present, the client is attempting to
   use a SAML <Response> negotiated earlier.  In this case, the server's
   next step is Outcome (Section 4.6).

   The gs2-cb-flag MUST be set as defined in [RFC5801] to indicate
   whether the client supports channel binding.  This takes the place of
   the PAOS HTTP header used in [SAMLECP20] to indicate channel binding
   support.

   The optional "gs2-authzid" field holds the authorization identity, as
   requested by the client.

4.3.  Server Response

   Assuming no SAML <Response> from the client, the SASL server responds
   with a SOAP envelope constructed in accordance with section 2.3.2 of
   [SAMLECP20].  This includes adhering to the SOAP header requirements
   of the SAML PAOS Binding [OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os], for
   compatibility with the existing profile.

Internet-Draft     SAML ECP SASL & GSS-API Mechanisms         March 2011


4.4.  User Authentication with Identity Provider

   Upon receipt of the Server Response (Section 4.3), the steps
   described in sections 2.3.3 through 2.3.6 of [SAMLECP20] are
   performed between the client and the chosen IdP.  The means by which
   the client determines the IdP to use, and where it is located, are
   out of scope of this mechanism.

   The exact means of authentication to the IdP are also out of scope,
   but clients supporting this mechanism MUST support HTTP Basic
   Authentication as defined in [RFC2617] and SHOULD support client
   authentication via TLS as defined in [RFC5246].

4.5.  Client Response

   Assuming a response is obtained from the IdP, the client responds to
   the SASL server with a SOAP envelope constructed in accordance with
   section 2.3.7 of [SAMLECP20].  This includes adhering to the SOAP
   header requirements of the SAML PAOS Binding
   [OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os], for compatibility with the existing
   profile.  If the client is unable to obtain a response from the IdP,
   it responds to the SASL server with a SOAP envelope containing a SOAP
   fault.

4.6.  Outcome

   The SAML protocol exchange having completed, the SASL server will
   transmit the outcome to the client depending on local validation of
   the client responses.

4.7.  Additional Notes

   Because this mechanism is an adaptation of an HTTP-based profile,
   there are a few requirements outlined in [SAMLECP20] that make
   reference to a response URL that is normally used to regulate where
   the client returns information to the RP.  There are also security-
   related checks built into the profile that involve this location.

   For compatibility with existing IdP and profile behavior, and to
   provide for secure identification of the RP to the client, the SASL
   server MUST populate responseConsumerURL and
   AssertionConsumerServiceURL attributes with its service name,
   expressed as an absolute URI.  The parties then perform the steps
   described in [SAMLECP20] as usual.

5.  SAML EC GSS-API Mechanism Specification

   This section and its sub-sections and all normative references of it
   not referenced elsewhere in this document are INFORMATIONAL for SASL
   implementors, but they are NORMATIVE for GSS-API implementors.

   The SAML SASL Enhanced Clients mechanism is also a GSS-API mechanism.
   The messages are the same, but a) the GS2 header on the client's
   first message and channel binding data is excluded when SAML EC is
   used as a GSS-API mechanism, and b) the RFC2743 section 3.1 initial
   context token header is prefixed to the client's first authentication
   message (context token).

   The GSS-API mechanism OID for SAML EC is 1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.4.6.

   SAML EC security contexts always have the mutual_state flag
   (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) set to TRUE.  SAML EC does not support credential
   delegation, therefore SAML EC security contexts alway have the
   deleg_state flag (GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG) set to FALSE.

   The SAML EC mechanism does not support per-message tokens or
   GSS_Pseudo_random.

5.1.  GSS-API Principal Name Types for SAML EC

   SAML EC supports standard generic name syntaxes for acceptors such as
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see [RFC2743], Section 4.1).  These
   service names MUST be associated with the SAML "entityID" claimed by
   the RP, such as through the use of SAML metadata
   [OASIS.saml-metadata-2.0-os].

   SAML EC supports only a single name type for initiators:
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME.  GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME is the default name type for
   SAML EC.

   The query, display, and exported name syntaxes for SAML EC principal
   names are all the same.  There are no SAML EC-specific name syntaxes
   -- applications should use generic GSS-API name types such as
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME and GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see [RFC2743],
   Section 4).  The exported name token does, of course, conform to
   [RFC2743], Section 3.2, but the "NAME" part of the token should be
   treated as a potential input string to the SAML EC name normalization
   rules.

   GSS-API name attributes may be defined in the future to hold the
   normalized SAML EC Identifier.

6.  Example

   Suppose the user has an identity at the SAML IdP saml.example.org and
   a Jabber Identifier (jid) "somenode@example.com", and wishes to
   authenticate his XMPP connection to xmpp.example.com (and example.com
   and example.org have established a SAML-capable trust relationship).
   The authentication on the wire would then look something like the
   following:

   Step 1: Client initiates stream to server:


   <stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client'
   xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'
   to='example.com' version='1.0'>


   Step 2: Server responds with a stream tag sent to client:


   <stream:stream
   xmlns='jabber:client' xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'
   id='some_id' from='example.com' version='1.0'>


   Step 3: Server informs client of available authentication mechanisms:


   <stream:features>
    <mechanisms xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'>
     <mechanism>DIGEST-MD5</mechanism>
     <mechanism>PLAIN</mechanism>
     <mechanism>SAML20EC</mechanism>
    </mechanisms>
   </stream:features>


   Step 4: Client selects an authentication mechanism and sends the
   initial client response (it is base64 encoded as specified by the
   XMPP SASL protocol profile):


   <auth xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl' mechanism='SAML20EC'>
   biws
   </auth>


   The initial response is "n,," which signals that channel binding is

   not used, there is no authorization identity, and the client did not
   provide a SAML <Response>.

   Step 5: Server sends a challenge to client in the form of a SOAP
   envelope containing its SAML <AuthnRequest>:

7.  Security Considerations

   This section will address only security considerations associated
   with the use of SAML with SASL applications.  For considerations
   relating to SAML in general, the reader is referred to the SAML
   specification and to other literature.  Similarly, for general SASL
   Security Considerations, the reader is referred to that
   specification.

   Version 2.0 of the Enhanced Client or Proxy Profile [SAMLECP20] adds
   optional support for channel binding and use of "Holder of Key"
   subject confirmation.  The former is strongly recommended for use
   with this mechanism to detect "Man in the Middle" attacks between the
   client and the RP without relying on flawed commercial TLS
   infrastructure.  The latter may be impractical in many cases, but is
   a valuable way of strengthening client authentication, protecting
   against phishing, and improving the overall mechanism.

7.1.  Risks Left Unaddressed

   The adaptation of a web-based profile that is largely designed around
   security-oblivious clients and a bearer model for security token
   validation results in a number of basic security exposures that
   should be weighed against the compatibility and client simplification
   benefits of this mechanism.

   When channel binding is not used, protection against "Man in the
   Middle" attacks is left to lower layer protocols such as TLS, and the
   development of user interfaces able to implement that has not been
   effectively demonstrated.  Failure to detect a MITM can result in
   phishing of the user's credentials if the attacker is between the
   client and IdP, or the theft and misuse of a short-lived credential
   (the SAML assertion) if the attacker is able to impersonate a RP.
   SAML allows for source address checking as a minor mitigation to the
   latter threat, but this is often impractical.  IdPs can mitigate to
   some extent the exposure of personal information to RP attackers by
   encrypting assertions with authenticated keys.

7.2.  User Privacy

   The IdP is aware of each RP that a user logs into.  There is nothing
   in the protocol to hide this information from the IdP.  It is not a
   requirement to track the activity, but there is nothing technically
   that prohibits the collection of this information.  SASL servers
   should be aware that SAML IdPs will track - to some extent - user
   access to their services.

   It is also out of scope of the mechanism to determine under what



Cantor & Josefsson      Expires September 3, 2011              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft     SAML ECP SASL & GSS-API Mechanisms         March 2011


   conditions an IdP will release particular information to a relying
   party, and it is generally unclear in what fashion user consent could
   be established in real time for the release of particular
   information.  The SOAP exchange with the IdP does not preclude such
   interaction, but neither does it define that interoperably.

7.3.  Collusion between RPs

   Depending on the information supplied by the IdP, it may be possible
   for RPs to correlate data that they have collected.  By using the
   same identifier to log into every RP, collusion between RPs is
   possible.  SAML supports the notion of pairwise, or targeted/
   directed, identity.  This allows the IdP to manage opaque, pairwise
   identifiers for each user that are specific to each RP.  However,
   correlation is often possible based on other attributes supplied, and
   is generally a topic that is beyond the scope of this mechanism.  It
   is sufficient to say that this mechanism does not introduce new

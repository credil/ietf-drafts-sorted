            draft-jesske-dispatch-servicenumber-routeing-00

Abstract

   The combination of "rn" and "npdi" parameters which are normally used
   for number portability (NP) can also solve numbering and routing
   problems.  Database dips to obtain routing numbers are not only
   needed for NP, but also for the routing of service numbers and short
   code numbers in the PSTN and also in SIP networks.  This document
   defines the use of the tel URI parameters defined for NP ("rn" and
   "npdi") to route service numbers and short code numbers.

3.  Overview

   Within [E.164] the numbering schemes for national and international
   numbers are defined.

   The following numbers within E.164 are known:

   International E.164-number for geographic areas.

   International E.164-number for global services.

   International E.164-number for Networks.

   International E.164-number for Groups of Countries.

   International E.164-number for Trials.

   [RFC3966]defines the tel URI to reflect the numbering schema for
   E.164 Numbers used within SIP networks.

   But specific numbers used by operators like service numbers for
   directory services, short numbers, specific networks or voting
   numbers and many others are not within this scope.  The routing of
   such numbers is difficult in such case and depends on the environment
   used.

   Service numbers can result in many possible terminations, e.g. a 0800
   service can be allocated to a nationwide company, or e.g. in Germany
   a special number for local government services is used with the
   number 115.

   Due to the fact that such numbers must be routed based on the
   location of the user within the network, and that the direct
   reachability of the terminating user shall be avoided, the routing is
   mainly based on a HEX digit prefix, like it is also used for ported
   numbers.

   For number portability RFC4694 [RFC4694] defines a routing number to
   route correctly the dialled number of the user which is ported to an
   other carrier domain.  To allow the routing to a ported user the
   originally dialled number has to be extended by an routing number.
   This routing number points to the other network domain where the user
   is now located.  In many countries HEX digit are used for such
   routing.

   Also PSTN is using routing prefixes not only for ported numbers but
   also for service numbers.  In many cases the routing is depended on
   the location where the call was originated.  In such cases within the
   SIP network a specific mechanism is needed.


4.  Requirements

   REQ-1:

   A mechanism is needed to route telephone numbers which are not E.164
   numbers.

   REQ-2:

   A mechanism is needed where routing prefixes have to be interworked
   from PSTN to SIP.


5.  Overall Applicability

   The SIP procedures specified in this document are foreseen to define
   an routing mechanism for service numbers that is equal as defined for

   ported numbers within RFC 4694.  Service numbers maybe defines within
   E.164 as global service numbers or within the national numbering pan.
   Short code numbers normally defined within the national numbering
   plan.  The SIP procedures specified in this document are foreseen to
   define an routing mechanism for service numbers.  This mechanism that
   is equal as to the procedures defined for ported numbers within RFC
   4694.  According to E.164 Service numbers may be defines within

   Such numbers will be reformatted within specific service platforms
   (Intelligent Network IN) to route that through the network.  Such
   numbers are not dialable for the user, they have HEX digits or digits
   that are not publicly allocated.

   A format of such reformatted service number looks like <0> + <routing
   prefix> + <service specific number> e.G <0> + < BC123> + <61511131>.
   Note that the <0> in Germany is dialled to identify the call as a
   national call and the <0> is not shown within the number it is
   indicated as "Nature of address indicator" is National Significant
   Number,.

   As shown in Figure 1 a SIP interworking Gateway receives an Initial
   Address Message (IAM) with the Called Party Number including the
   routing prefix.

   The SIP procedures specified in this document define a routing
   mechanism for service numbers.  This mechanism is equal to the
   procedures defined for ported numbers within RFC 4694.  According to
   E.164 service numbers may be defined as global service numbers or
   within the national numbering plan.

   Short code numbers are normally defined within the national numbering
   plan.  Such numbers will be reformatted within specific service
   platforms (Intelligent Network IN) in order to enable the routing
   through the network.  Such numbers can not be dialled by the user,
   they have HEX digits or digits that are not publicly allocated.

   A format of such reformatted service number looks like <0> + <routing
   prefix> + <service specific number> e.G <0> + < BC123> + <61511131>.
   Note that the <0> in Germany is dialled to identify the call as a
   national call and the <0> is not shown within the number, it is
   indicated as "Nature of address indicator" is National Significant
   Number.

   As shown in Figure 1 a SIP interworking gateway receives an Initial
   Address Message (IAM) with the Called Party Number including the
   routing prefix.

   Example: A received IAM (Initial Address Message) from the PSTN/ISDN

   network includes a CdPN: BC123-6151-1131 and the "Nature of address
   indicator" is National Significant Number.  The routing prefix in
   this case is the BC123.  The coding of ISUP is described within
   [Q.763]

   The interworked coding of the request URI in the INVITE should looks
   like the following INVITE:
   sip:+496151131;rn=+49BC1236151131@own-domain.com;user=phone

                         Figure 1 Gateway Scenario


                          +-----------+
            IAM (CdPN)    |           |  INVITE sip URI, rn, npdi

                          |           |
                          +-----------+




   In principle either a tel URI or sip URI could be used the format at
   the SIP outgoing side of the PSTN GW could be as follows.

   INVITE
   sip:+49-6151-1131;rn=+49-BC123-6151-1131@own-domain.com;user=phone

   INVITE tel:+49-6151-1131;rn=+49-BC123-6151-1131

            +-----------+                  +-----------+

            |    DB     |   Dip to DB      |    DB     | Dip to
            |           |   to find        |           | translate to
            +-----------+   destination    +-----------+ terminating URI
                  |                              |
                  |                              |
    INVITE  +-----------+ INVITE           +-----------+ INVITE
    tel URI |           | tel URI, rn, npdi|           | tel URI

   SIP      |   SP A    |                  |    SP B   |    SIP
   UA       +-----------+                  +-----------+    UA


   Another scenario is a SIP network which is used to apply the service
   number routing based on the same principles.  Prefixes are used where
   service numbers or short code numbers are dialled.  Such a scenario
   is a service provider B which is hosting a service which can be

Internet-Draft               Sevicerouteing                    July 2010


   accessed also by customers of other networks.  Meanwhile such numbers
   are not ported and they are very generic, and the originating
   (geographical E.164 Number) of the dialling user has to be taken into
   account.  Or the service is hosted within the PSTN of the same
   operator So the SIP Server of SP B in Figure 2 could be also an
   application within the PSTN.  And finally it can also be a local data
   base only accessable by the owner e.g. a private network or PBX.

   European number 115 for the "Single Government Service Telephone" is
   used in this example.  The user dials 115 for a the "Government
   Service Telephone".  He is living in village A and has the telephone
   local area code 6201.  But the l "Government Service Telephone" is
   centralised and is in city B with the telephone local area code 6221.
   So now to find the correct destination there is routing mechanism
   needed to route the INVITE to the correct terminating UA.

   Due to the fact that such numbers (115) could be routed in principle
   to more than one location.  To avoid that the caller is routed to
   city C instead of city B a data base needs to include a routing
   number to identify the termination application or network.  So the
   tel URI sent from the UA hat to be attached by the correct phone
   context like country code plus local area code.  So that the URI
   looks like: INVITE tel:+49-115; phone-context=+49-6201

   So the phone context of URI shows to which area the dialled number
   belongs.  Dipping the database for s numbers the dialled number
   including the phone context is pointing to the related routing number
   which is put into the INVITE as follows.

   INVITE tel:115; phone-context=+49-6201;rn=+49-1986-115; npdi

   Note that other service numbers or emergency numbers in Germany are
   using HEX digits within the routing number

   As mentioned in RFC 4964 how the call is actually routed based on the
   routing number in the "rn" parameter is outside the scope of this
   document.  The terminating SIP Server could dip a second data base
   either convert the request URI to the URI of the terminating UA.


6.  Normativ Rules

   This section describes the use of the parameters defined within
   RFC4694 [RFC4694] that are used for the routing of service numbers,
   short code numbers or other non E.164 numbers using additional
   routing information to reach the destination.

6.1.  Handling "tel" URI with NP Parameter or Parameters in addition to
      the procedures described within RFC4694

   The "npdi" parameter is used as described within RFC4694.

   The "cic" parameter is NP+freephone specific and is not needed for
   the purpose described within this document.  The "cic" describes when
   the call is sent to an other carrier where service numbers are
   located.  RFC4694 describes this case as ported free phone number.
   This could be each service number like voting calls or 0900 services.
   Also not each free phone number is ported it is given to the operator
   by the regulator.

   The "rn" parameter is used for routing to the destination.  The
   principles used for "rn" parameter in this document are the same as
   described within RFC4694.  The "rn" parameter identifies the
   destination that could be a network domain, service number
   application server or a PSTN application behind a PSTN GW.  The
   network node may access a data base or routing table or forward the
   request to a default address where further call handling on the
   request URI could appear.  The data bases used are not within the
   scope of NP.  Note that the routing for NP is only described within
   RFC4694.

6.2.  Adding NP Parameter or Parameters to the "tel" URI

   RFC 4684 describes two cases in terms of NP database access.  One is
   for an geographical telephone number and the other is for a free
   phone number.

   This document extends the use of routing database access for other
   numbers like service numbers and shortcut numbers where a "rn"
   parameter for routing is needed.  As already mentioned this could be
   numbers like 115 or 0900 and others.

   The principle of adding the parameters "rn" and "npdi" are the same
   as described within RFC 4694.

6.2.1.  Retrieving Routinginformation for a Service Telephone Number

   Service numbers could be personal numbers, 0900 numbers or other
   specific service extensions.  The rules of generating the "rn" and
   "npdi" parameter in RFC4694 apply in such cases.  The "cic" is not
   used in such cases.

6.2.2.  Adding NP Parameter or Parameters Due to Protocol Conversion

   For interworking between PSTN and SIP networks the "rn" and "npdi"
   parameters are used for numbers using routing extensions within the
   request URI.  The mapping of the Called Party Number to the "rn"
   parameter and request URI depends on the national ISUP implementation
   and is outside the scope of this document.  For not ported service
   number the "cic" is not within the scope of this document.


7.  Examples

   A "tel" URI, tel:+49-900-5331, contains a service telephone number
   "+49-900-5331".  This service number does not include any
   geographical information on that could be routed.  So the global
   context should also include the validity indicating the local area.
   Assume that this number cannot be routed via its own number the
   number is associated with a routing number "+49-CC202-900-0000".
   After retrieving the service-related information, the "tel" URI would
   be set to tel:+49-900-5331;npdi;rn=+49-CC202-900-0000


8.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as described within RFC4694 apply.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any implications for IANA.

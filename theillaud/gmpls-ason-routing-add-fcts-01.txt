Abstract

   [OSPF-ASON] defines OSPFv2 extensions to fulfill the requirements
   defined in [RFC4258].  In OIF discussion of ASON routing, OIF members
   have noted that some additional functionality beyond that defined in
   [OSPF-ASON] would be useful for deployment of ASON routing by OIF
   carriers.

   The purpose of this document is to list such additional
   functionalities, so that CCAMP experts study whether such
   functionalities can be fulfilled by existing GMPLS mechanisms, or
   whether extensions to [OSPF-ASON] are required.

   Some proposals for potential extensions are provided for review by
   IETF CCAMP.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   The ITU-T Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) control plane
   architecture is defined in [G.8080].  [G.7715] further defines the
   architecture and requirements for routing in ASON networks; and
   [G.7715.1] specifically refines such architecture and requirements
   for link state protocols.

   [RFC4258] captured those ITU-T requirements.  [RFC4652] evaluated he
   existing GMPLS routing protocols against the same requirements.  The
   necessary extensions to OSPFv2 to meet such requirements were defined
   in [OSPF-ASON].

   In discussing potential deployment of ASON routing, OIF members have
   identified additional functions that would be useful for routing in
   OIF carrier member ASON networks.  The purpose of this document is to
   identify and bring these functions to the IETF CCAMP working group,
   so that the IETF experts may study how to fulfill such new functions
   using existing GMPLS routing protocols mechanisms, or if necessary,
   define extensions to [OSPF-ASON] to support these additional
   functions.

   The two additional functions discussed in this document are:

   1.  Layer-scoped link attributes

   2.  Link associated local connection type

   This document also provides proposals for routing extensions that
   have been discussed within OIF for ASON routing.  They are provided
   for the purposes of clarifying the function they address and serving
   as proposals for extensions in CCAMP.


2.  Layer-scoped link attributes

2.1.  ITU-T G.7715.1 requirement

   [G.7715.1] section 9.5.1 specifies the set of link characteristic
   that are specific to a particular layer network.

   o  Link capacity: This attribute provides the sum of the available
      and potential link connections for a particular network transport
      layer.

   o  Link Weight: This attribute represents a vector of one or more
      metrics, each of which indicates the relative desirability of a
      particular link over another during path selection.

Internet-Draft  draft-theillaud-gmpls-ason-rting-add-fcts   October 2009


   o  Resource Class: This attribute corresponds to a set of
      administrative groups assigned by the operator to this link.  A
      link may belong to zero, one or more administrative groups.

   o  Local Connection Type: This attribute identifies whether the local
      SNP represents a TCP, CP, or can be flexibly configured as either
      a TCP or a CP.

   o  Link Availability: This attribute represents a vector of one or
      more availability factors for the link or link end.  Availability
      may be represented in different ways between domains and within
      domains.  Within domains it may be used to represent a
      survivability capability of the link or link end.  In addition,
      the availability factor may be used to represent a node
      survivability characteristic.

   o  Diversity Support: This attribute represents diversity information
      with respect to links, nodes and Shared Risk Groups (SRGs) that
      may be used during path computation.

   o  Local Client Adaptations Supported: This attribute represents the
      set of client layer adaptations supported by the TCP associated
      with the Local SNPP.  This is only applicable when the local SNP
      represents a TCP or can be flexibly configured as either a TCP or
      CP.

   Protocol extensions for all of these attributes, except Local
   Connection Type and Local Client Adaptations Supported, are already
   defined for TE-Links in [RFC3630] and [RFC4203].

   In OIF discussions it has been suggested that most of these
   attributes would be common across ITU-T layer networks supported by a
   particular link, however some attributes may take different values
   for different layer networks.

   For example, administrative weight associated with the link may have
   one value for VC-3 connectivity across the link and another value for
   VC-4 connectivity across the link in order to provide finer control
   of routing on a per layer basis.

   On the other hand diversity support is more likely to be based on
   physical link characteristics such as conduits that may be traversed
   by multiple physical links and be a common point of failure.

   Given that some attributes may differ per layer network and others
   are likely to be common across layer networks, an extension that
   supports advertisement of common attributes on a per link basis but
   allows some attributes to be scoped to a layer would be highly useful

2.2.  IETF extensions for ASON routing

   [RFC4258] does not require to scope an attribute to a specific layer,
   therefore [OSPF-ASON] does not provide a clear way to achieve such
   scoping.

   It has been recently suggested that GMPLS routing protocols may be
   able to meet such a requirement by using a specific TE LSA per layer
   (and so multiple TE LSAs for the same TE-Link).  The LSA itself
   scopes the attributes, the ISCD being used to identify the layer.  If
   multiple layers share the same attributes, then a single LSA with
   multiple ISCDs is fine.  However, this would lead to the
   advertisement of multiple TE LSAs for the same TE-Link, and it is not
   clear whether this is allowed by GMPLS routing protocols, or is an
   efficient solution.

2.3.  Proposed extension

   [OIF-EXP] details how the link capacity attribute has been scoped to
   a specific layer in ASON routing prototypes used in past OIF
   interoperability demonstrations.

   For all other attributes that must be scoped to a layer per
   [G.7715.1], this draft proposes a new sub-TLV of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA)
   top-level link TLV.  The proposed Link Attribute Scoping sub-TLV is
   defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type (tbd)                    | Length = 4 + x                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Switching Cap | Encoding      | Signal Type   | Connect Type  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   ~ Scoped TE-Link Attribute SubTLVs                              ~
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Note: x is the length of all the SubTLVs (including Type and Length
   fields) contained within the scoping subTLV.

   The Connect Type field is discussed in Section 3 below.

   The following sub-TLVs can be encoded within a Link Attribute Scoping
   sub-TLV:

   o  Traffic Engineering Metric sub-TLV.

Internet-Draft  draft-theillaud-gmpls-ason-rting-add-fcts   October 2009


   o  Administrative Group sub-TLV (Resource Class).

   A given sub-TLV may appear both as a sub-TLV of the top-level Link
   TLV, and as a sub-TLV of a Link Attribute Scoping sub-TLV.  In such a
   case, the former is relevant for all layers except the layer
   identified by the Link Attribute Scoping sub-TLV.


3.  Link associated local connection type

   The Local Connection Type is one of the link attribute required by
   [G.7715.1].

   This uni-directional attribute is used to identify if traffic
   presented on the associated far-end interface has access to the
   switching function contained within the network element for the
   specific layer.  If this attribute states that the far-end interface
   does not have access to this switching function, path computation
   will check to see if the element on the other side of the link is the
   intended destination, and if not disregard the link.

3.1.  IETF extensions for ASON routing

   [OSPF-ASON] section 4.1 suggests the local connection type can be
   inferred from ISCDs.

   The ISCD provides three fields that can be used to identify a layer:
   a switching type, an encoding type and for some switching types, a
   minimun bandwidth.  However, these three fields together may not
   allow distinguishing every layer, and as a consequence relying on
   ISCDs to infer each link-end local connection type may not work for
   all layers.

   One example that was brought up to the authors is about
   distinguishing:

   1.  An interface that supports high-order VC-4 and high-order VC-3
       layers.

   2.  An interface that supports high-order VC-4 and low-order VC-3
       layers.

3.2.  Proposed extension

   The Connect Type field of the Link Attribute Scoping sub-TLV defined
   in Section 2.3 can be used to specify the link connection type.

   The local connection type link attribute is considered layer-

   specific.  This proposed extension carries the local connection type
   within the Link Attribute Scoping sub-TLV, and therefore scopes this
   attribute to a specific layer.

   The connection type is encoded using a bit vector:

   o  0bxxxxxxx1 - Transit (i.e.  CTP)

   o  0bxxxxxx1x - Trail Sink (i.e.  TTP)

   Other bits are in this bit-vector are reserved, and must be sent as 0
   and ignored on reception.

                 DNS Redirect Use by Service Providers
                    draft-livingood-dns-redirect-03

Abstract

   The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-called
   DNS Redirect services deployed today by Internet Service Providers
   (ISPs), DNS Application Service Providers (ASPs), and other
   organizations providing so-called DNS Redirect services via their
   recursive DNS servers, as well as to describe the recommended
   practices regarding relating to DNS redirect.  This document
   specifically and narrowly addresses those cases where DNS Redirect is
   being utilized to provide a web error redirect service to end users,
   and describes the critical implications for DNS Redirect when DNSSEC
   is deployed.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Internet users typically are provided with several IP addresses for
   recursive DNS servers, as described in Section 2.3 of [RFC1591], by
   their respective ISPs, typically in an automated fashion via DHCP
   [RFC2131].  Some other users and organizations choose to use a
   different set of IP address for their DNS servers, which are hosted
   and managed by another organization, such as a DNS ASP.  It is also
   the case that a number of users and organizations choose to operate
   their own DNS servers, though those use cases are outside of the
   scope of this document.

   ISPs and DNS ASPs have over time created &quot enhanced &quot DNS
   services for their users, which often rely upon DNS Redirect
   functionality.  These enhanced services, which are offered on an
   opt-in or opt-out basis, can perform a number of enhanced services
   for users, such as attempting to interpret web address errors when an
   invalid fully qualified domain name (FQDN, Section 5.1 of [RFC1035])
   has been typed by a user.

   This document describes the design and function of a DNS Redirect
   service, as well as recommended practices and practices to avoid.  It
   also describes the critical implications for DNS Redirect when DNSSEC
   is adopted, in Section 4.


3.  Document Scope

   This document focuses on the systems and practices of ISPs and DNS
   ASPs.  All other use cases, such as when an Internet user or
   organization chooses to operate their own DNS servers is outside of
   the scope of this document.

   There are several ways that such entities can provide users with
   these enhanced DNS services.  In addition to methods which rely
   primarily upon a recursive DNS server, alternate methods include (a)
   interception and replacement of the error by a web browser client
   software, (b) interception and replacement of the error by a tool
   bar, plug-in, personal firewall security software or other web
   browser client add-on.  These alternate methods, which rely upon
   various types of client software, are also outside of the scope of



Creighton, et al.        Expires April 25, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    DNS Redirect Use by Service Providers     October 2010


   this document.

   It is important to note that while these alternate methods are
   considered out of scope for this document, this should not be
   interpreted as a negative judgment of their suitability or
   applicability to the relevant problem space.  Instead, these should
   simply be considered as alternate methods since, as with most any
   technical problem, there are a variety of valid methods for solving a
   problem.

   Lastly, while Section 7 indicates that users must be able to opt into
   or out of DNS Redirect services, the reasons for why an ISP or DNS
   ASP may choose one or the other as the default are out of scope.


4.  DNSSEC Considerations and Implications

   DNS security extensions defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035] use cryptographic digital signatures to provide origin
   authentication and integrity assurance for DNS data.  This is done by
   creating signatures for DNS data on a DNS Security-Aware
   Authoritative Name Server that can be used by DNS Security-Aware
   Resolvers to verify the answers.

   DNSSEC is now in the process of being deployed on authoritative
   servers, now that the DNS root has been signed and several key Top
   Level Domains (TLDs) have been signed.  DNSSEC is also starting to be
   adopted by service providers, which are now in the process of adding
   DNSSEC validation in DNS recursive resolvers.

   It is critically important that service providers understand that
   adoption of DNSSEC is technically incompatible with DNS redirect.  As
   such, in order to properly implement DNSSEC and maintain a valid
   chain of trust, DNS redirect MUST NOT be used any longer.  Thus, once
   DNSSEC is in widespread use, this document should be considered
   historical.  That being said, sections of this document concerning
   opt-in and opt-out practices may be useful for future reference in
   other, unrelated documents.


5.  Terminology

   While these terms are generally well known, it is important to define
   them in the context of this document.

Internet-Draft    DNS Redirect Use by Service Providers     October 2010


5.1.  Internet Service Provider (ISP)

   An Internet Service Provider, which provides Internet services,
   including basic network connectivity.  It is not germane to this
   document what the method of connection is, such as wired or wireless,
   what the speed of such a connection is, or what other services are
   included or available to users.  It is, however, assumed that the ISP
   is providing recursive DNS services to their users and is in some
   manner providing users with the IP addresses of these DNS servers,
   whether via DHCP, static assignment by users, or some other method.

5.2.  DNS Application Service Provider (ASP)

   A DNS Application Service Provider, which provides managed and/or
   hosted recursive DNS services (and possibly other DNS services) to
   their users.  In the case of managed services, the DNS ASP may
   remotely manage the recursive DNS servers in a user's network.  For a
   hosted recursive DNS service, these servers are typically located
   outside of the user's network and these hosted resources are shared
   across multiple users.  In most instances, these are hosted services
   and users are manually configuring either their DHCP server or their
   individual computing devices with the IP addresses of the recursive
   DNS servers operated by their ASP.

5.3.  Internet User

   An Internet user, which is generally a person using a computing
   device to connect to and make use of the Internet.  Such users are
   typically connected at the edge of the network, though the method by
   which they connect to the Internet is not particularly relevant to
   this document.

5.4.  DNS Recursive Resolver

   A DNS recursive resolver processes fully qualified domain name
   queries (FQDN, Section 5.1 of [RFC1035]) into IP addresses by finding
   the resource records in the authoritative DNS servers for the domain
   associated with the FQDN.  The resource records are then cached on
   the recursive server for future requests until an expiration timer
   expires called time to live (TTL), as described in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC2181].  These servers are in most cases provided by ISPs for name
   resolution.

5.5.  Web Browser

   Client software operated by the user locally on their computing
   device, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple
   Safari, Google Chrome, etc.

Internet-Draft    DNS Redirect Use by Service Providers     October 2010


5.6.  Web Error Landing Server

   The host that a user is directed to when the DNS Recursive Server
   receives a NXDOMAIN response.  The contents of the web page that the
   web server sends the user varies widely across different ISPs and DNS
   ASPs.  In some cases it is simply a more descriptive error that the
   user would otherwise receive, while in other cases it may include
   links to sites similar to the URL attempted and/or a search page,
   among many other possibilities.

5.7.  User Options Web Server

   The web server that a user is directed to via a link on a page served
   by the Web Error Landing Server, the Malicious Domain Web Error
   Landing Server, from another system such as an account management
   system, or via direct access, which enables a user to control whether
   or not they are opted into or opted out of DNS Redirect services.
   This is described in additional detail in the Section 7 section.

5.8.  NXDOMAIN Response

   In this document, an NXDOMAIN (nonexistent domain) response can be
   used interchangeably with an RCODE 3 response.  The RCODE 3 response
   was first documented in see Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035]).  Subsequent
   RFCs introduced the term NXDOMAIN response, which is synonymous with
   RCODE 3 and tends to be used more frequently, as noted in Section 2.2
   of [RFC2136], and Section 1 of [RFC2308].


6.  Web Error Redirect

   A web error redirect service enables an ISP or ASP to provide a user,
   who is generally utilizing a web browser, with an improved user
   experience when an attempt to reach a nonexistent domain is made.

6.1.  Web Error Redirect Problem Statement

   A user enters an incorrect URL into their web browser, such as
   http://www.example.invalid, where .invalid is a nonexistent Top Level
   Domain (TLD, see Section 2 of [RFC1591]).  In such a case, a user
   would typically receive an error.

6.2.  Web Error Redirect Solution Description

   When a recursive DNS server detects such a nonexistent domain error
   (NXDOMAIN, see Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035]), the ISP or ASP can
   instead provide a IP address for a Web Error Landing Server that can
   present the user with a list of suggested destinations rather than



Creighton, et al.        Expires April 25, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    DNS Redirect Use by Service Providers     October 2010


   simply an error page.  This page must also provide the user with a
   link to a method of opting out in the future.  See Figure 1,
   Figure 2, and Figure 5 for examples below.

6.3.  Web Error Redirect Solution Considerations

   It is important to note that this technology can directly impact non-
   web clients such as instant messaging, VPNs, FTP, email filters-
   related DNS queries.  Thus, special exclusions may need to be made in
   order to prevent unintentional side effects.  Design considerations
   for the Web Error Search and Malicious Site Protection services
   should include properly and promptly terminating non-HTTP connection
   requests.  Only A and AAAA resource records should be redirected, all
   other resource record types must be answered as if there was no
   redirection.


7.  Opt-In or Opt-Out Mechanisms

   ISPs and DNS ASPs MUST provide their users with a method to opt into
   (opt-in) or out (opt-out) of some or all DNS Redirect services.  Opt-
   out and opt-in methods should be reliable and should take into
   consideration the Section 8 section below.  Whether such services are
   offered on an opt-in or opt-out basis depends on a range of factors
   which are outside of the scope of this document.  The two different
   methods, opt-out and opt-in, are described below.

7.1.  Opt-Out

   Opt-Out is used when the users are by default offered all or some DNS
   Redirect services.  As a result, the user must take an action to
   disable some or all such services.  This is typically performed via a
   User Options Web Server.  Users that have chosen to opt-out should
   receive DNS responses which are indistinguishable from those
   responses provided by a DNS server with no DNS Redirect
   functionality.  In addition, opt-out should be persistent in nature,
   which means that opt-out should be tied to a fixed credential or
   attribute of some type, such as an account identifier, billing
   identifier, or equipment identifier, which is not typically subject
   to change on a regular basis.

7.2.  Opt-In

   Opt-In is used when the users are by default not offered any DNS
   Redirect services.  As a result, the user must take an action to
   enable some or all such services.  This is typically performed via a
   User Options Web Server.

Internet-Draft    DNS Redirect Use by Service Providers     October 2010


7.3.  Automated Mechanisms and Reasonable Processing Times

   Once a user has selected to opt-in or opt-out of DNS Redirect
   services, such changes should occur automatically, when this is
   technically possible, without requiring the user to manually change
   any settings on their computing device.  Such changes should also
   occur within a reasonable period of time.  In some cases, however, a
   user may be offered the ability to speed the period of time for these
   changes to take effect, such as by restarting the computing device or
   a piece of network equipment which connects them to their ISP's
   network, for example.

   While an automated mechanism may be the easiest for users, since it
   requires no manual reconfiguration of their network settings, the
   authors also recognize that there may be extenuating circumstances
   where this is not achievable.  In such cases, which may for example
   be due to the particular attributes of one or another ISP's network
   design, a fully automated mechanism may not be possible.  Another
   example is where a user is switching from their ISP's DNS server IP
   addresses to those of a DNS ASP.  As a result, a user in all of these
   cases, as well as other possible cases, must manually reconfigure
   their network with different DNS IP addresses.

7.4.  Type of Opt-Out Method

   There are several workable methods that can be employed to effect the
   actual opt-out for a given user.  These include setting a local user
   application attribute, such as via a cookie in a web browser, as well
   as setting a network attribute, via a DHCP change or manually
   configuring the DNS IP addresses (in the operating system, modem,
   home gateway device, or router) in order to change the DNS IP
   addresses for a particular user.

   While all of these methods are workable and can be made reliable, the
   best current method is via a network-based change of some sort.  In
   this way, all Internet-connected computing devices within a given
   household are included in the opt-out (these devices are generally
   connected in some manner to the LAN side of some type of customer
   premise device, such as a cable modem or DSL modem).  This is in
   contrast to a method which uses a local user application attribute,
   such as a cookie in a web browser, where deletion of cookies, upgrade
   to a new operating system, upgrade to a new web browser, use of a
   different web browser, or countless other factors on that device
   could cause the user to be opted back into a DNS Redirect service.
   Thus, a network-based approach which sets opt-out-related attributes
   at the device, or household level, is the most inclusive and
   persistent method for providing a reliable opt-out method, and is the
   recommended practice.

8.  Practices to Avoid

   This document primarily focuses on the recommended practices for an
   ISP or ASP to provide users with DNS Redirect services.  However, it
   is important to note that some entities may not operate in accordance
   with such practices.  As such, some of these are catalogued below in
   order to contrast them with recommended practices and provide
   information which may be of interest and use to the community.

8.1.  Use of DNS Redirect with DNSSEC

   When DNSSEC has been implemented in a service provider's resolvers,
   DNS redirect MUST NOT be used, as it is technically incompatible with
   DNSSEC and breaks the chain of trust critical to proper DNSSEC
   validation functionality.

8.2.  Improper Redirect of Valid Responses

   It has been observed that some service providers improperly utilize
   DNS Redirect services when there is a valid DNS resource record
   returned in response to a DNS recursive query.  The effect is to
   redirect users to a server not maintained by the intended
   destination, such as a web site that looks like the intended web site
   but is not actually the intended site and is instead controlled by
   the service provider.  For example a DNS query for www.example.com
   results in a valid A record response, but this valid response is
   instead replaced with an A record controlled by the service provider.
   In this case the intended server identified with the valid A record
   contained valid, lawful, non-malicious content, and there would
   otherwise appear to be no valid justification for a redirect to
   occur.  See Figure 6 for an example below.

   If there is a valid and reasonable justification for such a redirect
   to occur, examples of which are not currently known by the authors of
   this document, then the resulting connection to the server that the
   user has been redirected to should clearly and prominently disclose
   that this is not the intended site.  For example, in the case of an
   attempt by a user to connect to a web site, the site may contain a
   banner or frame which indicates that this is not the intended site or
   that the site is in some manner controlled by the service provider.
   In addition, such a notice should also offer a clear method to opt-
   out of this redirect function.

   Thus, to summarize, redirection of valid responses SHOULD NOT be
   performed.

Internet-Draft    DNS Redirect Use by Service Providers     October 2010


8.3.  Redirect of SERVFAIL Responses

   Redirection of SERVFAIL responses SHOULD NOT occur.  SERVFAIL
   responses may occur intermittently in an operational network for a
   variety of highly transient reasons.  As a result, a DNS Redirect
   should not be performed when a SERVFAIL response is received, as
   normal retry a short time later is likely to result in a valid
   response.

8.4.  Routinely Broken, Purposefully Broken, and Otherwise Unreliable
      Opt-Out Mechanisms

   There are several well known and dependable methods of opt-out
   mechanisms that ISPs and DNS ASPs can deploy for users to opt-out of
   their DNS Redirect services.  These methods can rather easily be
   employed and are highly recommended, as noted in Section 7.  However,
   some ISPs and DNS ASPs may instead choose to employ a less dependable
   mechanism, which routinely fails to work as expected by users or is
   known not to function properly.

   For example, one routinely unreliable method for opt-out is the
   cookie-based method.  When a user opts out of a DNS Redirect service,
   a cookie is installed in their web browser.  The problem with this
   method occurs when a user clears their cookies or the cookies are
   deleted for some reason.  In some cases, users may configure their
   web browsers to clear all cookies every time the close their web
   browser.  Thus, one possible effect upon the user in this case is
   that they are once again opted into the redirect service.
   Furthermore, a cookie-based method has the effect of only opting out
   browser-based protocols (generally HTTP and HTTPS), which means that
   the user may have non-web applications affected by DNS Redirect, even
   though they believe they have opted-out.  As a result, there is no
   assured permanency with this opt-out method, nor does it work
   consistently across all applications and protocols, which can be
   aggravating to users who do not wish to utilize DNS Redirect
   services.

   Another example of an unreliable method for opt-out is one where opt-
   out is tied to the IP address of the user, where that address may be
   subject to change on a regular basis, such as via an ISP-based DHCP
   lease.  In such a case, if opt-out was tied to what can be considered
   a largely dynamic IP address, then the user would be opted-in every
   time they received a new IP address, forcing them to repeatedly opt-
   out.

   Thus, to summarize, the opt-out mechanism provided to users SHOULD be
   reliable and SHOULD NOT be routinely broken, purposefully broken, or
   otherwise unreliable.

8.5.  Markedly Slower DNS Query Performance

   An ISP or DNS ASP should also understand that DNS query latency, the
   time between when a user's stub resolver issues a DNS query and
   receives a DNS response, should be kept as low as is reasonably
   possible.  High DNS query latency is often perceived by users, and
   can have an adverse effect on a variety of applications where low DNS
   query latency may be especially important.  Any additional processing
   which must be performed in order to provide DNS Redirect services
   should be monitored closely, in order that DNS Redirect functionality
   does not markedly slow DNS query performance.

   Thus, to summarize, when DNS redirect is performed, DNS query
   performance SHOULD NOT suffer as a result, since this could provide
   an incrementally inferior user experience as compared to when DNS
   redirect is not performed.

8.6.  Override of a User's DNS Selection

   Some users may decide to use the DNS server IP addresses of a DNS ASP
   or other non-ISP-provided DNS servers.  Such selections should be
   preserved as the free choice of a user, particularly when DNS
   Redirect services are offered.  Thus, an ISP SHOULD NOT redirect port
   53 DNS traffic from servers intended by the user via their selection
   of non-ISP DNS servers to the DNS servers of the ISP, except in
   reasonable and justifiable cases where a user has been placed into a
   so-called "walled garden" for reasons of abuse, security compromise,
   account non-payment, new service activation, etc.

   An exception to this is when, unbeknownst to the user, malicious
   software (malware) has changed the IP address of their DNS server to
   a known malicious DNS server.  In such cases, it may be in the best
   interests of the user to take steps to ensure they do not use such a
   malicious DNS server, particularly since they did not intend to do so
   and may be infected with malware.  While this is unrelated to DNS
   Redirect per se, it merits mentioning based on feedback received from
   the security community.


9.  Functional Design

   The functional design described in this section is intended to be
   generally representative of the many different ways that DNS Redirect
   services are deployed today.  As such, they are necessarily high
   level and different implementations may vary somewhat, due to any
   number of factors.

9.1.  DNS Recursive Resolver

   The DNS Recursive Resolver is used by the host computer to translate
   fully qualified domain names into IP addresses, according to Section
   3.6.1 of [RFC1034].  When a FQDN does not exist in authoritative DNS
   a NXDOMAIN response, as described in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035] is
   normally returned (see Figure 1).  In the case of DNS Redirect, the
   NXDOMAIN response is changed to reply with a resource record (RR)
   response which instructs the host computer to send the original
   request to a new IP address (see Figure 1).


                   Request                  Request

9.2.  Web Error Landing Server

   When a user requests an invalid URL or Domain, their web client is
   redirected to a Web Error Landing Server which presents several
   possible helpful website views (see Figure 2).  The first is "Did you
   mean..." response which presents the user with possible correct
   results based on their original invalid request.  The search server
   can also present search engine results to the user.

9.3.  Web Browser Client

   The Web Browser Client is redirected to a Web Server Landing Page
   instead of presenting an error page when there is no valid DNS record
   present.

   Examples of common Web Browser Clients include:

   o  Microsoft Internet Explorer

   o  Mozilla Firefox

   o  Apple Safari

   o  Google Chrome

   o  Opera

9.4.  Domain White List

   There may be certain domains which should be not be redirected under
   any circumstances for technical, legal, business, or other reasons.
   The Domain White List can contain both domains, such as
   *.example.com, as well as specific FQDNs, such as www.example.com.

   For instance, the owner of example.com may request that the ISP or
   DNS ASP not perform DNS Redirect for the example.com domain, so that
   there is no DNS Redirect resulting from queries to nonexistent names,
   such as invalid.example.com.

   flows, in order to better explain certain DNS and HTTP use cases.

10.4.  Improper Redirect of Valid Response Redirect and HTTP Flow

   This example represents an improper redirect occurring when a valid
   DNS RR should have been returned in response to a DNS recursive query
   for an example website, the resulting HTTP transaction, and that no
   DNS query or HTTP traffic was sent to the valid authoritative DNS
   server and valid web server.  Section 4 shows one of the reasons why
   this practice is problematic.  Another reason is that a user intends
   to visit a valid resource with lawful and legitimate content, such as
   a web site, and is instead sent to a different destination (which may

11.  Security Considerations

   The critical considerations relating to DNS Security Extensions are
   detailed in Section 4.

   Security best practices should be followed regarding access to the
   opt-in and opt-out functions, in order that someone other than the
   user is able to change the user's DNS Redirect settings.  For
   example, the User Options Web Server must not permit someone to
   modify a page URI to access and change another user's options.  Thus,
   if the URI is
   "http://www.example.net/redirect-options.php?account=1234", someone
   must not be able to modify the account to be "=1235" and then be able
   to change the options for a different user with some other additional
   validation being performed.  While web site security practices are
   outside the scope of this document, the authors believe it is
   important to identify such problematic use cases to any ISPs and DNS
   ASPs offering and/or implementing DNS Redirect functionality.

12.  Controvery Surrounding DNS Redirect

   It is clear based on the community feedback that this document has
   elicited, and from debates which have occurred over the years prior
   to this document, that DNS Redirect is a controversial topic.  Views
   on whether DNS Redirect should be performed or not vary widely.  Some
   feel strongly that it is a valid practice from which end users derive
   benefits.  Some others feel that DNS Redirect should not be performed
   and that it puts at risk trust in and stability of the DNS.  Others
   in the community are neutral on the topic and have expressed the view
   that as long as DNS Redirect does not slow the deployment of DNSSEC,
   that it is transparently disclosed to end users, and that those end
   users have easy opt-out methods, that it is an acceptable, or at
   least tolerated, practice.  This moderate view is probably the
   majority view, though critics of DNS Redirect have expressed their
   views firmly and many of those holding such strongly critical views
   have played and continue to play a key role in DNS protocols and
   other critical areas of the IETF and the Internet community.  Some
   strong critics also describe resolvers that perform DNS Redirect as
   "lying resolvers", explaining that the accurate and therefore honest
   response is an NXDOMAIN response and that anything else is not
   intended and is considered a lie.

   Thus, it is important for readers to understand that DNS Redirect
   remains a practice which is subject to some controversy and that
   there is not strong consensus in support of it.  At best, there is
   what could be described as grudging acceptance of the practice if it
   has been implemented along the lines recommended in this document.
   In addition, many critics take solace in the view that as DNSSEC is
   increasingly deployed that DNS Redirect is likely to decline
   correspondingly over time.

   Finally, any provider implementing DNS Redirect is well advised to
   follow the recommendations outlined herein.  This is because many
   critics of DNS Redirect have explained that their strong views
   developed or deepened when they observed that some implementers have
   deployed systems which fail to provide an easy and/or reliable opt-
   out method, redirect valid responses, or follow practices noted as
   ones to avoid in Section 8.


13.  Future Prospects for DNS Redirect

   As noted in Section 4, there exists today a technical incompatibility
   between DNSSEC and DNS Redirect.  While it is possible that some
   provider implementing DNS Redirect today will uncover a method to
   implement DNSSEC and DNS Redirect, currently these two functions do
   not go well together.  As such, providers will soon or are now facing

   a decision between embracing and deploying DNSSEC or continuing to
   perform DNS Redirect.  It is likely that many of these providers will
   choose to deploy DNSSEC, as some already are doing [Comcast DNSSEC
   Rollout Announced].  It is also possible that some others will deploy
   DNSSEC-validating DNS recursive resolvers alongside those resolvers
   performing DNS Redirect, giving their customers the choice between
   the two.  In this case, it is likely that over time customers will
   express a preference for greater levels of Internet security,
   including DNSSEC and other forms of security, and that their
   respective service providers will evolve their offerings to satisfy
   these customer needs.


14.  Why This Document Merits Publishing

   Documentation of DNS Redirect is beneficial for the Internet
   community in and of itself.  Prior to this document, the IETF lacked
   a stable reference document that described how DNS Redirect was
   designed and implemented, even though the practice has become
   relatively widespread.  As a result, one benefit of publishing this
   is to document the design and implementation of DNS Redirect on the
   Internet.

   An additional benefit of the document is to guide those providers
   which decide to implement DNS Redirect on what practices should be
   avoided and what steps should be taken to ensure that end users are
   able to easily and reliably opt out of such a system.  While it does
   not seem appropriate, based on the community response noted in
   Section 12, to identify this as a Best Current Practices (BCP)
   document, this can guide implementers on what to avoid and on "least
   worst" practices as some in the community have described them.

   Furthermore, this documents other key aspects of DNS Redirect that
   are valuable.  For example, this document encourages transparency and
   disclosure of DNS Redirect practices on the Internet, and notes
   community concerns and controversy regarding the practice, all of
   which may be valuable to refer back to in future documents or to
   refer to during future debates in the Internet community.  There will
   also be future systems which call for well functioning opt-out
   systems.  For such systems, the sections referring to automated opt-
   out mechanisms and reasonable processing times of opt-out requests,
   in Section 7.3, and the reliability of opt-out systems, in
   Section 8.4, may be valuable.  Finally, Section 8.6 describes that a
   user's selection of an alternative DNS server IP address should not
   be overridden, which seems an important principle to highlight.

Appendix A.  Document Change Log

   [RFC Editor: This section is to be removed before publication]

   -03: Changed some text to make it more neutral, and introduced new
   sections: Controvery Surrounding DNS Redirect, Future Prospects for
   DNS Redirect, and Why This Document Merits Publishing.  Also closed
   out an open issue to remove references to RFC 2535, which is
   obsolete.  Lastly, updated the section 8.6 on override of user DNS
   choices to note a malware case raised during a document review.

   -02: Fixed some small grammatical nits.

   -01: Removed sections regarding malicious domain protection, legally-
   mandated redirect, and content-based redirect based on DNSOP WG
   feedback to split those out into separate documents which will be
   published in the future.  Also significantly modified the DNSSEC
   section and moved it to the top of the document.  Also, capitalized
   applicable 2119 language.

   -00: First version published.


Appendix B.  Open Issues

   [RFC Editor: This section is to be removed before publication]

   1.  RW: Consider whether it is a good idea to add to section 4.9
       (NXDOMAIN RESPONSE) a reference to Authenticated Denial of
       Existence described in RFC4035 section 5.4 as these should be
       also redirected.

   2.  MB: Consider addressing how opt-out works when a user roams
       across a shared WiFi AP.

   3.  Ensure that references are in the appropriate section (normative
       vs. informative).

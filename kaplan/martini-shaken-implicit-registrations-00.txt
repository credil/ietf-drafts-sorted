1. Introduction 
    
   The SIP protocol, as defined in [RFC3261] and its extensions, 
   supports multiple means of resolving the connection information 
   necessary to deliver out-of-dialog SIP requests to their intended 
   targets.  When a SIP UA or Proxy needs to send a request to a target 
   which is scoped in a domain for which it is not 
   authoritative/responsible, the UA/Proxy can use [RFC3263] procedures 
   for using DNS to resolve the next-hop connection information.  When 
   a UA/Proxy needs to send a request to a target address-of-record 
   (AoR) within its domain, it can use its location service to resolve 
   the Registered Contact URI, and potentially any Path information 
   attached to it per [RFC3327], to build a route set to reach the 
   target UA(s). 
    
   It is not uncommon, however, to use REGISTER requests to provide the 
   reachability information for such cases, even for AoRs and domains 
   the REGISTER request does not explicitly identify it is registering

   for.  This draft defines the behavior of such a mechanism, coined 
   "Implicit Registration". 
    
   This authors know of at least four organizations using this type of 
   model: the SIP Forum, ETSI, 3GPP, and CableLabs.   
 
2. Definitions 
    
   For brevity's sake, this document uses the word "request" instead of 
   "out-of-dialog request", but in all cases this term means out-of-
   dialog request. 
 
   AoR: address-of-record, as defined by RFC 3261: a URI by which the 
   user is canonically known (e.g., on their business cards, in the 
   From header field of their requests, in the To header field of 
   REGISTER requests). 
    
   Domain Name: An explicit identifier which defines a separate scope 
   of authority, following the syntax and semantics of DNS. 
    
   Explicitly Registered AoR: A mutually agreed-upon AoR used for the 
   REGISTER transaction, identified in the To-URI of the REGISTER 
   request. 
    
   Implicit Registration: implicitly providing the reachability 
   information for something other than the AoR indicated in the 
   Register transaction. 
    
   Reachability Information: a set of URIs identifying the host and 
   path of Proxies to reach that host; like any URI, these URIs may 
   identify the specific connection transport, IP Address, and port 
   information, or they may only identify FQDN's. 
    
   SSP: SIP Service Provider, as defined by [RFC5486]. 
    
3.   Background Discussion  
    
   In some environments, notably the Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) 
   market, SIP devices in the Enterprise are effectively IP-PBX's, 
   behind which are other devices (including SIP devices) supporting 
   individual users within the Enterprise. The SIP IP-PBX receives 
   Primary Rate Interface (PRI) type SIP trunk services from a SIP 
   Service Provider (SSP).  The SIP IP-PBX device is authoritative for 
   its local AoRs and uses Implicit Registration to provide 
   reachability information to the SSP for those AoRs. 
    
   In SIP, there is an assumption that AoRs of a given SIP Domain are 
   under the authority of that Domain, and it alone has the right and 
   responsibility to provide SIP services for those AoRs, such as call-

   forwarding, forking, fallback to voicemail, etc.  When a SIP UA 
   registers an AoR, it is actually claiming authority/responsibility 
   for that AoR. Likewise, when a SIP UA (e.g., a SIP IP-PBX) performs 
   an Implicit Registration, it is actually claiming 
   authority/responsibility for the set of AoRs it is implicitly 
   Registering for. 
    
3.1. The Need for Implicit Registration 
    
   Even if the SMB has its own Domain Name, not every small business 
   owner has a DNS, or has the technical capability to provision DNS 
   entries (e.g., SRV's) appropriately in their DNS, or has the ability 
   to do so through any third party which hosts their domain name(s), 
   or has the wish to make their SIP device address known publicly.  In 
   many cases, DNS resolution would not be sufficient to route requests 
   to the SMB, because specific SIP Proxies need to be traversed to 
   reach the SMB.  Furthermore, the SMB may not have its own Domain 
   Name at all, and instead merely has an IP Address. 
    
   Because a single SSP may support multiple thousands of such SMB IP-
   PBX's, it is impractical and cost-prohibitive to manually provision 
   their IP Addresses in every SIP node along the path which needs to 
   reach the SMB IP-PBX customer.  Instead, a dynamic reachability 
   mechanism is needed. 
    
   Such a mechanism already exists for SIP: the REGISTER method.  A 
   REGISTER request provides dynamic reachability information for an 
   AoR's authoritative domain. 
    
   Since a REGISTER request mechanism is generally supported by most 
   SIP Service Providers' equipment, it has become common practice for 
   small SIP IP-PBX's to use the mechanism as a means of providing 
   their reachability information.  In some cases interoperability 
   problems have arisen, due to differing expectations and 
   implementations of how such a mechanism should work in practice.

3.2. Benefits of using REGISTER 
    
   Using a REGISTER request for providing reachability information has 
   several benefits: 
     . It alleviates the Enterprise from having a SIP signaling 
        address publicly viewable in DNS.  
     . It provides mechanisms that make the SIP device publicly 
        reachable even if a NAT exists between the device and the 
        Service Provider network. 
     . It avoids having to statically provision the path from the 
        Service Provider core through edge proxies per Enterprise, 
        because the Path header field can be used. 
     . It allows the Service Provider to give the SIP device a pre-
        loaded route set for subsequent requests, using the Service-
        Route header field per [RFC3608]. 
     . It provides a periodic keep-alive mechanism, in order to detect 
        service outages, and service restoration. 
     . It is an existing SIP request method type, known to be 
        supported by most SIP devices. 
     . It is conceptually similar to the Registration behavior model 
        in RFC 3261. 
    
4.   Implicit Registration Mechanism 
    
4.1. Overview of the Mechanism 
    
   In an Implicit Registration model, the SIP UA (i.e., an IP-PBX) 
   Registers using a single, mutually agreed-upon, Address-of-Record 
   (AoR).   
    
   The Contact URI it Registers for that AoR, along with any Path 
   header field information, represents the reachability information 
   used to route subsequent requests from the SSP to the SIP UA, for 
   the Registered AoR and any implicitly registered AoRs. 
    
   The REGISTER transaction creates a real SIP Registration per 
   [RFC3261], and updates a location service database for the SIP AoR 
   being Registered as well as other mutually agreed-upon AoRs. 
    
   The mechanics of routing out-of-dialog requests to the AoRs, 
   however, is different from "normal" Registration-based location 
   service resolution routing.  In particular, in order for the UA to 
   determine which AoR is being targeted by a request, the request-URI 
   is not replaced by the Registered Contact-URI; instead the Contact-
   URI is inserted as a loose-route Route header field value, along 
   with any stored Path information.

Internet-Draft        SIP Implicit Registrations         December 2009 
 
 
4.2. Administrative Responsibility of AoRs 
                                                                         
   In an Implicit Registration model, the SIP UA (i.e., an IP-PBX) is 
   technically authoritative for its explicitly and implicitly 
   Registered AoRs.  What this means is that a request from one AoR of 
   the IP-PBX targeted for another AoR of the same IP-PBX would be 
   routed locally within the IP-PBX, directly to the other AoR.  This 
   implies that UAs behind the IP-PBX need to Register reachability 
   information for their AoRs with the SIP IP-PBX, so that they can be 
   reached from the SIP-PBX. If they were to Register their 
   reachability information with the SSP instead, they would not be 
   reachable from within the IP-PBX, only from the SSP. By registering 
   with the IP-PBX, which in turn uses implicit registration to 
   register their AoRs with the SSP, those UAs can be reached either 
   from within the IP-PBX or from the SSP (via the IP-PBX).   
    
4.3. User Agent Behavior 
    
4.3.1     Generating the REGISTER Request 
    
   All procedures for constructing the REGISTER request defined in 
   section 10.2 of [RFC3261] apply, with the additional constraints 
   defined in this section. 
    
   The target Request-URI of the REGISTER request MUST be the Domain 
   Name of the SSP or a Registrar host name of the SSP. 
    
   The To and From URIs of the REGISTER request MUST contain the 
   mutually agreed-upon explicit AoR to be Registered, in a SIP or SIPS 
   URI format.  The URI MUST have a user portion, to uniquely identify 
   the IP-PBX. 
    
   Note that using a SIP URI instead of a SIPS URI for the AoR does not 
   preclude using TLS for the entire path between the UA and the 
   Registrar, nor does it preclude using SIPS URIs for the explicit or 
   implicit AoRs in other SIP requests to or from the Registering SIP 
   UA.  For a SIPS scheme to be usable, the Implicit Registration would 
   have to be done over a transport which SIPS allows (e.g., TLS). 
    
   The To header field MUST contain a new "multi" header parameter, 
   with the value "true".  This indicates the AoR being Registered may 
   not be the only AoR being registered, and that instead the mechanism 
   defined in this document is being used.  A new option-tag defined 
   later in this document will require the Registrar to support this 
   new parameter. 
    
   The REGISTER request MUST contain one and only one Contact URI, 
   which MUST be the transport connection reachability address 
   information for reaching the UA/IP-PBX.  If a UA/IP-PBX has multiple

Internet-Draft        SIP Implicit Registrations         December 2009 
 
 
   connection paths it can be reached through (e.g., multiple 
   transports or multiple interfaces), each one MUST be Registered 
   separately, in separate REGISTER transactions with their individual 
   respective Contact URIs.   
    
   The Contact header field of the REGISTER request MAY contain a 'q' 
   q-value parameter to indicate a relative preference for this 
   particular reachability information, as defined in [RFC3261] section 
   20.10.  Note that only a single Contact URI is allowed in a single 
   REGISTER request based on this document's mechanism, and thus the q-
   value is relative to all REGISTER requests for the same UA/IP-PBX.  
   The default q-value, if not explicitly indicated, is 0.5. 
    
   The Contact header field MUST contain an 'expires' parameter, 
   indicating how long the Contact URI is valid, as defined in 
   [RFC3261]. 
    
   The Contact URI MUST contain an "lr" URI parameter, indicating the 
   URI is used as a loose-route.  The option-tag defined for this 
   mechanism later is used to require the Registrar to support this 
   parameter in the Contact URI. 
    
   The procedures in [SIP-Outbound] SHOULD be followed, if both the SIP 
   UA and the SSP support Outbound.  Using Outbound procedures does not 
   change the fundamental behavior of the mechanism described in this 
   document; it only provides additional procedures and fields for 
   Registering multiple flows using identifiers, with specific keep-
   alive mechanisms and timers. 
    
   The REGISTER request MUST contain the new 'implicit' option-tag in a 
   Require header field.  This option-tag indicates the Registrar must 
   support the mechanism identified in this document to process the 
   Register request successfully.  In particular, it will require the 
   Registrar to detect the "lr" URI parameter in the Contact URI which 
   indicates the Contact URI is a loose-route for the AoR being 
   Registered, and detect the "multi=true" To header field parameter. 
    
4.4. Registrar Behavior 
    
   This document uses the same logical location service database 
   concept of [RFC3261] residing in the Registrar, for the purpose of 
   describing the behavior of the mechanism in this document.  Specific 
   implementations need not follow this data structure, so long as they 
   maintain the same logical external behavior. 
    
4.4.1     Processing the REGISTER Request 
    
   All REGISTER processing rules for Registrars defined in section 10.3 
   of [RFC3261] apply, except as noted herein.

Internet-Draft        SIP Implicit Registrations         December 2009 
 
 
    
   When receiving a REGISTER request with a Require header field 
   containing "implicit", and the Registrar supports this extension, 
   and assuming valid authentication, the Registrar MUST check the To 
   header field for the new "multi" parameter.  The procedures below 
   apply only if this parameter is present and has the value "true". 
    
   The "multi=true" parameter indicates the AoR being Registered may 
   not be the only AoR being Registered, and that one or more mutually 
   pre-agreed-upon AoRs will also be Registered with the reachability 
   information of this REGISTER request.  In such a case, each location 
   service database entry for the set of mutual agreed-upon AoRs is 
   updated with the reachability information (Contact and Path) and q-
   value of the received REGISTER request. 
    
   If a matching entry is found in the database and the Contact URI 
   being Registered does not match any already in the database for the 
   entry, the Registrar MUST add the entry as a serial-forking entry 
   only.  Parallel forking to multiple contacts of the same AoR does 
   not make sense in an SSP-to-IP-PBX model.   
    
   If a q-value is received, it MUST be added as well, otherwise the 
   default q-value of 0.5 MUST be used.  The q-value affects the serial 
   forking decision for multiply registered Contacts. 
    
   The Registrar MUST indicate support for this mechanism by inserting 
   the new "implicit" option-tag in a Supported header field, and by 
   keeping the "multi=true" To-header parameter, in the REGISTER 
   response. 
    
   The Registrar SHOULD indicate all of the implicitly Registered AoRs 
   in a P-Associated-URI header field(s) in the 200 response to the 
   REGISTER, if it supports [RFC3455]. 
   [OPEN ISSUE: should we mandate PAU support?  Should we document a 
   legal/compliant means of indicating AoR username "wildcards"?] 
    
4.4.2     Routing SIP Requests 
    
   If the SSP receives a SIP request containing a Request-URI that 
   identifies an AoR registered either explicitly or implicitly using a 
   REGISTER request with "multi=true" in the To header field, then the 
   SSP MUST NOT replace the Request-URI with the Registered Contact 
   URI.  Instead, a Route header field(s) MUST be inserted with the 
   value of the Registered reachability information, after any other 
   Route header field values generated from local policies.  Note the 
   Registered reachability information comprises any received Path URIs 
   and the entire Registered Contact URI, including any userinfo 
   portion, URI parameters, and embedded headers.  As per [RFC3327], 
   the created Route header field values would be based on the

   Registered Path URI list in received order, with the Registered 
   Contact URI appended as the last and final entry.   
    
   If multiple matching entries are found, for example due to multiple 
   Registered Contact URIs for the same explicit AoR, then the q-value 
   of each Registered Contact URI MUST be used to select the route set 
   for serial forking.  The highest q-value is selected first, and only 
   if it fails is the next highest one attempted, and so on. 
    
5.   Examples 
    
   The following sections provide example cases of the mechanism 
   defined in this document.  Each example includes more than one 
   concept being shown at the same time.  The first example shows a 
   single Registrar-Proxy case, using an implicit q-value, where there 
   are no implicit AoRs.  The second example shows a separate edge-
   Proxy before the Registrar, with the Path header field mechanism 
   being used and an explicit q-value, with one implicit AoR.  Both 
   examples show a REGISTER transaction and an initial INVITE request.  
    
5.1. Example-1: Registrar only 
    
   As an example, assume the following scenario: 
    
      UA1----REG-----UA2 
    
   The node marked UA1 is the Registering IP-PBX; REG is a registrar 
   and a proxy, and serves as the authoritative proxy for 
   ssp.example.net; and UA2 is another UA trying to reach a user of 
   UA1. 
    
   Note that some header fields (e.g., Content-Length) and session 
   descriptions are omitted to provide a shorter and hopefully more 
   readable presentation.

5.2. Example-2: Registrar with Proxy 
    
   As an example, assume the following scenario: 
    
      UA1----P1-----REG-----UA2 
    
   The node marked UA1 is the Registering IP-PBX; P1 is the SSP's edge 
   proxy; REG is a registrar and a proxy, and serves as the 
   authoritative proxy for ssp.example.net; and UA2 is another UA 
   trying to reach a user of UA1. 
    
   In this example, there are implicitly registered AoRs. 
    
   Note that some header fields (e.g. Content-Length) and session 
   descriptions are omitted to provide a shorter and hopefully more 
   readable presentation.

6.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This document will request IANA for a new SIP option-tag named 
   "implicit", for the purpose defined herein; a new header field 
   parameter named "multi" with a single value of "true", as defined 
   previously; and to update the applicability of the "lr" URI 
   parameter to apply to the Contact URI.

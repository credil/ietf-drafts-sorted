Internet-Draft        SIP INFO Package for DTMF           August 2010 
 
 
Abstract

   The SIP INFO request method now supports explicit indication and 
   exchange of specified application information.  Such usages are 
   documented as an "INFO Package", following the requirements outlined 
   in [info-packages].  This document specifies one such SIP INFO 
   Package, for the purpose of indicating DTMF signals.

1. Introduction
    
   Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency tones are used in numerous telephony 
   applications, in multiple ways and for multiple purposes.  From a 
   SIP protocol perspective, they follow one or both of two paths: the 
   RTP media path, and/or the SIP signaling path.  DTMF in the media 
   path is handled by [RFC4733], with a reasonable level of 
   interoperability, if both ends of the session support it. 
    
   There are, however, numerous cases in which DTMF tones need to be 
   sent in the signaling path.  The most often cited use-case for such 
   is calling-card applications, where the calling-card application 
   server is not in the media path but needs to detect DTMF tones.  
   There are many other use-cases, however, including SIP-to-H.323 
   Interworking Gateways, distributed IVR and voicemail-retrieval 
   systems, and some IP-PBX systems. 
    
   Historically there have been multiple ways of exchanging DTMF in the 
   SIP signaling path: INFO, NOTIFY and KPML [RFC4730].  KPML works by 
   having the application server(s) create Subscriptions to the end 
   User-Agent (UA), and the UA sends NOTIFY messages within the

Internet-Draft        SIP INFO Package for DTMF           August 2010 
 
 
   SUBSCRIBE dialog to indicate the DTMF tones.  To date, KPML has seen 
   limited deployment.  Another method, using non-KPML NOTIFY requests, 
   has usually been implemented by sending NOTIFY messages in the 
   INVITE-based dialog, without a SUBSCRIBE; but the use of NOTIFY as 
   such is not very common. 
    
   Legacy INFO usage for DTMF is widely deployed, but has no documented 
   standard and there are at least two known variants in use (although 
   one is arguably far more popular).  The two variants use different 
   MIME bodies in the INFO message to indicate the DTMF: an 
   "application/dtmf" and an "application/dtmf-relay" MIME body type, 
   with dtmf-relay being the most commonly used one.  Although no 
   standard exists for dtmf-relay, it is documented on several websites 
   and extremely simple, with a high level of interoperability.  This 
   document is intended to standardize such a mechanism, using the INFO 
   Package model, for a "dtmf" INFO Package. 
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  The 
   terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary". 
    
3. The "dtmf" INFO Package 
    
   This document defines a new INFO Package called "dtmf", for the 
   purpose of exchanging DTMF tone signals in the SIP signaling path. 
    
3.1. Overall Description 
    
   The dtmf INFO Package is used to carry DTMF tone signals, indicating 
   the specific tone and duration, in "application/dtmf-relay" type 
   MIME bodies in INFO requests messages inside an INVITE-based dialog. 
    
4. Overview of Operation 
    
   The general concept is that the UAC and UAS negotiate support for a 
   "dtmf" INFO Package during the initial INVITE transaction, using the 
   [info-package] mechanism.  Including the "dtmf" INFO Package name in 
   the Recv-Info header field means the UA sending the header supports 
   receiving DTMF events using this mechanism.  When the far-end has 
   indicated that the it supports receiving "dtmf", and the user 
   presses a DTMF digit, the UA sends it in an INFO request.  The digit 
   pressed and the duration it was pressed for are encoded in an 
   "application/dtmf-relay" MIME type attachment in the INFO, described 
   later in this document.

Internet-Draft        SIP INFO Package for DTMF           August 2010 
 
 
   If a SIP server in the signaling path between the calling UAC and 
   answering UAS wants to receive DTMF indications following this 
   mechanism, they must act as a B2BUA.  Such behavior is out of scope 
   of this document.  
    
5. INFO Package Definition  
    
5.1. INFO Package Name 
    
   This document defines a SIP INFO Package as defined in [info-
   packages].  The INFO Package token name for this package is "dtmf". 
    
5.2. INFO Bodies 
    
   Applications using this INFO Package MUST include an 
   "application/dtmf-relay" body in INFO requests to indicate which 
   digit was pressed by the user.  The body contains exactly two lines: 
   one of the button pushed, the other of the duration.  The body is 
   described in ABNF form as follows: 
    
   Dtmf-relay-body = digit-line CRLF duration-line 
    
   digit-line      = "Signal" EQUAL SP button 
   button          = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "*" / "#" 
    
   duration-line   = "Duration" EQUAL SP msecs 
   msecs           = 1*4(DIGIT)  ;100-5000 millisecs 
    
    
5.3. UA Behavior 
    
   A UA supporting this draft MUST indicate the user-pressed button 
   through INFO if the remote UA indicated it supports receiving the 
   "dtmf" INFO Package, per the rules in [info-packages].  If [RFC4733] 
   (i.e., RTP-based DTMF events) was also indicated by the far-end in 
   SDP, and the local UA supports sending such, it MUST send the event 
   indication through both means simultaneously.  If the UA also 
   supports [KPML] and some entity subscribed for the "kpml" package 
   for the same call, the UA still MUST send dtmf indication through 
   the INFO, and MUST also send such through a [KPML] Notify assuming 
   it would have done so otherwise. (i.e., assuming the regex matched 
   and so on) 
 
   The UA MUST populate the "application/dtmf-relay" body, as defined 
   earlier, with the button pressed and the duration it was pressed 
   for.  Technically, this actually requires the INFO to be generated 
   when the user *releases* the button, however if the user has still 
   not released a button after 5 seconds, which is the maximum duration

   supported by this mechanism, the UA should generate the INFO at that 
   time. 
    
    
6. Example Exchange 
 
   In the following example, Alice initiates a call to Bob.  Alice can 
   support sending or receiving "dtmf" events. 
    
   Alice generates the following: (note: much has been left out for 
   simplicity) 
      INVITE sip:bob@example.com SIP/2.0 
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.1:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds10 
      To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com> 
      From: Alice <sip:alice@example.net>;tag=1234567 
      Call-Id: 123456mcmxcix 
      CSeq: 1 INVITE 
      Contact: <sip:alice@192.0.2.1> 
      Accept: application/sdp, application/dtmf-relay 
      Recv-Info: dtmf 
    
   Bob checks the headers, and can support receiving "dtmf".   
    
      SIP/2.0 180 Ringing 
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.1:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds10 
      To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=abcdefg 
      From: Alice <sip:alice@example.net>;tag=1234567 
      Call-Id: 123456mcmxcix 
      CSeq: 1 INVITE 
      Accept: application/sdp, application/dtmf-relay 
      Recv-Info: dtmf 
    
   Since he sent the Recv-Info header in the 180, Bob also sends it in 
   the 200. 
    
      SIP/2.0 200 OK 
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.1:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds10 
      To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=abcdefg 
      From: Alice <sip:alice@example.net>;tag=1234567 
      Call-Id: 123456mcmxcix 
      CSeq: 1 INVITE 
      Contact: <sip:bob@192.0.2.2> 
      Accept: application/sdp, application/dtmf-relay 
      Recv-Info: dtmf

   At some later time, Alice presses number 6 on her keypad, for 100ms.  
   She sends the following: 
    
      INFO sip:bob@192.0.2.2 SIP/2.0 
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.1:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnabcdef 
      From: Alice <sip:alice@example.net>;tag=1234567 
      To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=abcdefg 
      Call-Id: 123456mcmxcix 
      CSeq: 2 INFO 
      Contact: <sip:alice@192.0.2.1> 
      Info-Package: dtmf 
      Content-Disposition: Info-Package 
      Content-Type: application/dtmf-relay 
      Content-Length: 26 
    
      Signal= 6 
      Duration= 100 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   There are no specific security issues for this mechanism, beyond 
   those already applicable to SIP-based session signaling and [info-
   packages].  
    
    
8.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This document will presumably register the INFO Package name "dtmf" 
   and "application/dtmf-relay" MIME type, if it moves forward.

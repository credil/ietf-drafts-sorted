Internet-Draft     EDNS Option Code for SIP Source          July 2010 
 
 
Abstract 
    
   This document requests an IANA allocation for an EDNS Option code, 
   per [RFC2671], for an opaque field for private use.  The intended 
   use of this field is for providing source information for the query.

1. Introduction 
    
   In certain circumstances, DNS clients querying a private DNS server 
   need to provide the server with some additional private data 
   concerning the source of the query, which may aid the server in 
   providing an answer.  The additional data is in the form of a text 
   string, which needs to be provided in the DNS query request.  The 
   Extension Mechanism for DNS (EDNS) defined in [RFC2671] provides a 
   suitable means by which to encode such a string into the DNS 
   request, using the OPT RR and a new EDNS Option code indicating this 
   field use.   
    
   This document requests IANA for assignment of such an Option code, 
   for providing SIP source reference information in DNS requests used 
   for ENUM, in private, controlled environments only.  This is NOT 
   applicable to nor appropriate for the general public Internet DNS, 
   and the only reason this document exists is to obtain a reserved 
   option code number, for interoperability among vendors within 
   private environments. 
    
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  The

Internet-Draft     EDNS Option Code for SIP Source          July 2010 
 
 
   terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary". 
    
    
3. Applicability 
    
   This draft requests a new Option code value based on [EDNS0].  
    
    
4. OPTION-DATA Format 
    
   The format of the OPTION-DATA contents is an ascii-text string, with 
   no character termination (the OPTION-LENGTH field identifies the 
   length). 
    
   Although the text string should be opaque in general, for the 
   private use envisioned for it the contents of the text string are a 
   URI, typically a SIP URI.  One example is a SIP/SIPS/TEL-URI, 
   including the "sip:", "sips:", or "tel:" schemes.  Non-Ascii 
   characters, or characters not allowed in the ABNF for a SIP-
   URI/SIPS-URI/TEL-URI format per [RFC3261] or [RFC3966] MUST be 
   escaped per those formats. 
    
   The usage and source of the text content is outside the scope of 
   this document.   
    
   The query option is of a multi-hop, transitive nature. 
    
    
5. Security Considerations 
    
   There are privacy concerns with regard to passing on SIP source 
   reference information in a DNS query.  The intent of this option is 
   for a purely private use, in a controlled environment. 
    
    
6.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This document requests that IANA register in the in the "Domain Name 
   System (DNS) Parameters" registry at 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters in sub-registry "DNS 
   EDNS0 Options", a new option named "SIP Source Reference".

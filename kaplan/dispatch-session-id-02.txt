Internet-Draft          SIP Session Identifier               July 2010 
 

Abstract
    
   There is a need for having a globally unique session identifier for 
   the same SIP session, which can be consistently maintained across 
   Proxies, B2BUAs and other SIP middle-boxes, for the purpose of 
   Troubleshooting.  This draft proposes a new SIP header to carry such 
   a value: Session-ID.

1. Introduction
    
   The SIP [RFC3261] Call-ID header value is a globally unique 
   identifier, mandatory in all requests/responses, which identifies 
   SIP messages belonging to the same dialog or registration.  It 
   provides a portion of the SIP message dialog-matching criteria, and 
   is used in such things as [Replaces] headers and [dialog-events] 
   package for matching to dialogs, and in [SIP-Identity] and 
   [Connected-identity] as one of the inputs for signing.

Internet-Draft          SIP Session Identifier               July 2010 
 
 
    
   In practice, the Call-ID is often changed by B2BUAs and other such 
   middle-boxes in the logical end-to-end message path.  A B2BUA 
   logically represents a UAS and UAC, and as such generates a new 
   Call-ID value for the dialog it creates on its UAC side; in fact for 
   some B2BUA scenarios the Call-ID must be changed for SIP to function 
   properly. 
    
   At the same time, there is a need for a unique, common, consistent 
   end-to-end identifier to help troubleshoot SIP sessions and message-
   flows as they cross SIP nodes.  Troubleshooting is more complicated 
   if multiple legs of the session are on different sides of B2BUAs, 
   due to the lack of a common identifier such as a Call-ID to tie the 
   legs together.  Proprietary mechanisms are currently used to achieve 
   this goal. 
    
   Therefore, in order to provide an identifier which will not be 
   modified/replaced by B2BUAs, this draft proposes a new SIP Header 
   "Session-ID", and mandatory rules for the value of such a header.  
   The rules are designed to be such that the value in the Session-ID 
   header is not considered unsafe, private, or have any property which 
   would cause B2BUAs to change it.  The goal of this draft is to 
   enable use-cases which need a unique identifier for a given session 
   which can successfully cross B2BUAs, such as Application Servers, 
   Softswitches, PBXs, SBCs, Feature Servers, etc. 
    
1.1. Requirements 
    
   The following requirements drive the need for Session-ID: 
    
   REQ1: It must be possible for an administrator to use the identifier 
   to identify a set of dialogs which have a direct correlation with 
   each other such that they represent the same SIP session, with as 
   high a probability as possible. 
    
   REQ2: It must be possible to pass the identifier through SIP B2BUAs, 
   with as high a probability as possible.  This requirement drives the 
   following requirements: 
    
   REQ2a: The identifier must not reveal any information related to any 
   SIP device or domain identity, including IP Address, port, hostname, 
   domain name, username, Address-of-Record, MAC address, IP address 
   family, transport type, etc. 
    
   REQ2b: The identifier must not reveal to the receiver of it that the 
   Call-ID, tags, or any other SIP header or body portion have been 
   changed by middle-boxes, with as high a probability as possible.

Internet-Draft          SIP Session Identifier               July 2010 
 
 
   REQ2c: The identifier must not be used for anything at a SIP layer 
   to change the behavior of the SIP protocol. 
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  The 
   terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary". 
    
   This document uses the terms "header field" and "header field value" 
   following the definition of those terms in [RFC3261], which are not 
   interchangeable.  The "header field" is the entire SIP header's 
   contents, including any parameters.  The "header field value" is 
   only the field-value portion, which does not include header 
   parameters. 
    
3. Overview of Operation 
    
   The general concept is that the UAC generating an out-of-dialog 
   request generates a new, pseudo-random, unique value which remains 
   constant for the duration of the transaction, any dialog created 
   from that request, or for a registration.  The value is inserted in 
   a new Session-ID header field defined in this draft.  The UAC and 
   UAS then reflect this header field value in all messages for the 
   duration of the dialog.  In other words, the Session-ID provides a 
   value similar in nature to Call-ID, except one which crosses B2BUAs 
   and which has no sensitive information in it. 
    
   To aid in migration of deployments, a B2BUA or Proxy MAY also 
   generate and/or insert the value on behalf of a UAC or UAS, if one 
   or the other does not support this document's mechanism. 
    
   Although the Session-ID concept is similar to the Call-ID, it is not 
   used for message dialog-matching rules in RFC 3261, nor does it 
   change the Call-ID usage, nor does it replace the Call-ID value.  
   Instead this new header field provides an identifier for 
   troubleshooting uses only. 
    
   The format of the Session-ID value is restricted, both to avoid 
   detection of the system type which generated it, and to keep it a 
   hexadecimal representation such that it can be stored as a 128-bit 
   binary value in log records.

4. Session-ID Behavior 
    
4.1. Generating a Session-ID value 
    
   This draft proposes the Session-ID header value be generated based 
   on a defined hash mechanism for creating a 128-bit pseudo-random 
   value, and encode it as its lower-case hex representation.  The 
   reason for specifying the mechanism is two-fold: to make it 
   impossible to determine the manufacturer of the device which 
   generated it by looking at its format or value, and to allow devices 
   to generate the same value if they have the same private key.   
    
   The Session-ID value is generated by taking the Call-ID header 
   value, and SHA-1 hashing it based on [RFC2104] HMAC using a locally 
   generated pseudo-random 128-bit system secret key, to create a 128-
   bit resultant HMAC value.  The secret key makes the resultant HMAC 
   value not re-creatable by other parties, which is necessary to 
   prevent detection of Call-IDs being changed, as required by Req-2b.  
   Otherwise, middle-boxes may have motivation to remove the Session-ID 
   in order to hide the fact that they changed the Call-ID. 
    
   Per [RFC2104], the algorithm is thus HMAC-SHA-1-128(Call-ID_value, 
   secret_key), and the 128-bit result is encoded using lowercase 
   alphanumeric hex representation, as defined in the ABNF section of 
   this document. 
    
   In order to enable trouble-shooting of in-dialog messages, a 
   generator needs to remember or re-create the same Session-ID value 
   for the duration of a given dialog(s).  This is described in more 
   detail in following sections of this document. 
    
4.2. UAC Behavior 
    
   The rules for when a UAC generates a new Session-ID value are 
   similar as those for Call-ID value: a UAC supporting this document's 
   mechanism MUST generate a new unique Session-ID value whenever it 
   generates an out-of-dialog request, or for a new Registration.  The 
   exception to this rule is for out-of-dialog REFER requests, or 
   INVITE with [RFC3891] Replaces header field, as described in section 
   5. 
    
   The UAC MUST re-use the same Session-ID value for in-dialog messages 
   as that of the original dialog-creating request, and for any out-of-
   dialog request it retransmits or re-generates in response to a 3xx, 
   or it re-formulates due to failure responses.  This follows the 
   rules in [RFC3261] for Call-ID generation. 
    
   Session-ID values in Registration "refreshes" - REGISTER requests 
   which are used to update the expiry time but not to register a new

Internet-Draft          SIP Session Identifier               July 2010 
 
 
   contact - MUST use the same Session-ID value as previous REGISTER 
   requests.  New Registrations, which add or change the Contact URI 
   for the AoR, but not simply to delete them, MUST use a new Session-
   ID value.  This follows the behavior of Call-ID per RFC 3261; it is 
   re-iterated here because some devices incorrectly change their Call-
   ID value for every re-Registration, and MUST NOT do the same to the 
   Session-ID. 
    
   The UAC MUST include the Session-ID header field in every SIP 
   message it transmits. 
 
4.3. UAS Behavior 
    
   A UAS compliant with this document MUST copy a received Session-ID 
   header field in a request, into responses and subsequent upstream 
   requests sent within the dialog. 
    
   If an out-of-dialog request is received without a Session-ID header 
   field, the UAS SHOULD generate a new one for subsequent use in the 
   transaction and dialog, as defined for a UAC, and use the same value 
   in all responses and upstream in-dialog requests for the same 
   dialog. 
    
4.4. Proxy Behavior 
    
   A Proxy MUST NOT remove or modify the Session-ID header field it 
   receives, if one is in the message.  By definition, an RFC 3261 
   compliant Proxy would not modify or remove such a header.   
    
   If the Proxy forks a request, it MUST copy the same Session-ID 
   header field into all the forked request copies.  If the Proxy 
   recurses requests due to 3xx redirection, or regenerates requests 
   due to failures, it MUST use the same Session-ID header field as the 
   original request, just as the UAC does. 
    
   If the Proxy locally generates any response or request based on a 
   received request, including 100 Trying, it MUST insert any received 
   Session-ID header field from the original request into the response 
   message it locally creates.  This is necessary for troubleshooting 
   purposes. 
    
   A Proxy compliant with this draft MAY generate a new Session-ID or 
   insert a previously saved one, if and only if none existed in a 
   received message, following the rules for doing so as a B2BUA 
   defined later. 
    
4.5. B2BUA Behavior 
    

 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - January 2010                [Page 6] 
Internet-Draft          SIP Session Identifier               July 2010 
 
 
   A B2BUA compliant with this document MUST copy the Session-ID header 
   field it receives in requests as a UAS into the related requests it 
   generates as a UAC; and any Session-ID field it receives in 
   responses as a UAC into the correlated responses it generates as a 
   UAS. 
    
   If the B2BUA forks or creates multiple requests as a UAC, from a 
   request it received as a UAS, the B2BUA MUST copy the same Session-
   ID header field it received into all the forks/requests.  If the 
   B2BUA recurses requests due to 3xx redirection, or regenerates 
   requests due to failures, it MUST use the same Session-ID field, 
   just as the UAC does. 
    
   If the B2BUA locally generates any response or request based on a 
   received request, including 100 Trying, it MUST insert any received 
   Session-ID field from the original request into the response message 
   it locally creates. 
    
   A B2BUA MAY remember the received Session-ID value for the duration 
   of the transaction and dialog, for the purpose of re-insertion, in 
   case the far-end does not support this draft. 
    
   In all cases, if the SIP message received by a B2BUA contained a 
   Session-ID header field, a B2BUA compliant with this document MUST 
   NOT remove, modify or replace it as it "forwards" the message on the 
   other logical UA "side" of itself. 
    
4.5.1     B2BUA Generation of New Session-ID 
    
   If an out-of-dialog request is received by a B2BUA compliant with 
   this document, and the request does *not* contain a Session-ID 
   header field, the B2BUA MAY generate a new one.  The new Session-ID 
   value MUST be calculated based on the received Call-ID of the 
   received request, even if the B2BUA uses a different Call-ID value 
   for requests generated on its other "side(s)".  It MUST then insert 
   it in any requests or responses it generates, as if it had actually 
   received the new Session-ID from the UAC, following the rules 
   previously defined for a B2BUA.  This allows for a B2BUA to provide 
   a migration to Session-ID deployment, on behalf of upstream nodes 
   that do not yet support it.   
    
   As defined previously, if any received message already had a 
   Session-ID, a B2BUA compliant with this document would not replace 
   it. 
    
4.5.2     B2BUA Insertion of Saved Session-ID 
    
   If a Session-ID was received in an out-of-dialog request, or the 
   B2BUA locally generated one because none existed, the B2BUA SHOULD 
 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - January 2010                [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft          SIP Session Identifier               July 2010 
 
 
   insert the same Session-ID field into all responses and upstream in-
   dialog requests if and only if a Session-ID is not already in them.  
   This allows for a B2BUA to provide a migration to Session-ID 
   deployment, on behalf of downstream nodes that do not yet support 
   it. 
    
5. Handling SIP Transfer Scenarios 
    
   The transfer or movement of SIP sessions represents a complication 
   for a Session-ID type mechanism.  On the one hand, the replacement 
   SIP session represents a new one, and could reasonably be expected 
   to use a new Session-ID value; on the other hand, from a 
   troubleshooting and human user perspective, it is clearly related 
   to, if not just a continuation of, the previous session.  Since the 
   purpose of this document's mechanism is to aid monitoring and 
   troubleshooting, and not used for actual SIP protocol mechanics, the 
   behavior defined in this section is to re-use the same Session-ID 
   value for the replacement SIP session. 
    
   In order to do so, the Session-ID of the "original" session is 
   transferred as well, in the Refer-To URI of a [RFC3515] REFER 
   request.  Furthermore, out-of-dialog REFER and INVITE with [RFC3891] 
   Replaces requests use the appropriate Session-ID values.  This 
   assumes, of course, that the UAs involved support the Session-ID 
   mechanism.  If they do not, then it is possible for the Session-ID 
   to not be "carried forward" to the new SIP dialog.  Unfortunately, 
   this means troubleshooting such dialogs is not improved/aided by 
   this document's mechanism; but it would not "break" anything at a 
   SIP layer. 
    
   It should also be noted that using the same Session-ID for the 
   transferred-to dialog means the same Session-ID now exists in two 
   independent dialogs, because the original one may well continue due 
   to the implicit Subscription usage created by a REFER - that 
   implicit Subscription based usage will continue to use the same 
   Session-ID as the new dialog created to the transferred-to party. 
    
   For the following sub-sections, the term "UA" is used for User 
   Agent.  The language applies to the SIP device which creates the 
   request, whether it be a UA or B2BUA. 
    
5.1. Out-of-Dialog REFER 
    
   A UA compliant with this document MUST use the same Session-ID 
   header field value for an out-of-dialog REFER request it generates, 
   as the original dialog the REFER is targeted to (i.e., as if the 
   REFER had been in-dialog).  For example, if UA Bob has a SIP dialog 
   X to Alice, and Bob sends an out-of-dialog REFER to Alice to refer 

 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - January 2010                [Page 8] 
Internet-Draft          SIP Session Identifier               July 2010 
 
 
   her to Charlie, the Session-ID header field value of the REFER 
   request would be the same as that used in dialog X. 
   [Open issue: an alternative is to insert the Session-ID as a new 
   parameter in a [RFC4538] Target-Dialog header of the REFER] 
    
5.2. Refer-To URI 
    
   A UA compliant with this document MUST add the Session-ID header 
   field as an embedded header in the Refer-To header field URI of any 
   REFER request it generates, using the value of the session it is 
   referring to.  For example, if UA Bob has a SIP dialog X to Alice 
   and dialog Y to Charlie, and Bob sends a REFER request to Alice to 
   refer her to Charlie, the Session-ID header field value embedded in 
   the Refer-To URI of the REFER request would be the same as that used 
   in dialog Y. 
    
5.3. Out-of-Dialog INVITE with Replaces 
    
   When generating an out-of-dialog INVITE with [RFC3891] Replaces 
   header field, a UA compliant with this document MUST use the same 
   Session-ID header field value for the INVITE request as that used 
   for the dialog it is replacing, if it knows the value.  Typically it 
   would know the value by having received it in the Refer-To header 
   field of a REFER, as described previously.  For example, if UA Bob 
   has a SIP dialog X to Alice and dialog Y to Charlie, and Bob sends a 
   REFER request to Alice to refer her to Charlie, the Session-ID 
   header field value embedded in the Refer-To URI of the REFER request 
   would be the one used in dialog Y, which Alice would use as the 
   Session-ID header field value for her INVITE to Charlie. 
    
   If the UA does not know the Session-ID of the dialog it is 
   replacing, for example because it is not embedded in the Refer-To 
   URI of a received REFER, then it MUST use a new Session-ID value, 
   calculated using the mechanism as defined in section 4.1 with the 
   Call-ID of the INVITE. 
    
6. Session-ID Migration and Failure Scenarios 
    
   SIP is already widely deployed on the Internet, and it is 
   impractical to expect all UAs to be upgraded to support this 
   document's mechanism in the near future.  A solution for gradual 
   migration is necessary, which this document provides by allowing 
   B2BUAs or Proxies to perform the Session-ID generator and inserter 
   role.  Even within those device types, it is impractical to expect 
   all B2BUAs to support this mechanism all at once, or any time in the 
   near future.  Therefore, it is expected that some B2BUAs and/or UAs 
   will support generating and inserting Session-ID, while others will 
   not support Session-ID at all. 
    
 
 
Kaplan                  Expires - January 2010                [Page 9] 
Internet-Draft          SIP Session Identifier               July 2010 
 
 
   Due to the varying types of B2BUAs, such as PBXs, SBCs, Application 
   Servers, Feature Servers, and Softswitches of various flavors, and 
   the numerous SIP deployment models in use, there are going to be 
   cases in which Session-ID will fail to be a consistent value for all 
   related dialogs, or fail to successfully match.  The goal of this 
   draft is to improve troubleshooting of current deployments as much 
   as possible - and in this author's opinion that is the best that can 
   be done given the constraints. 
    
   One example is for forked requests: if a UAC which does not support 
   this mechanism sends a request to a Proxy or B2BUA which also does 
   not support this mechanism, each fork could reach B2BUAs or UASs 
   which *do* support this mechanism.  In such a case, each of those 
   forked-to B2BUA/UAS will generate unique Session-IDs and put them in 
   their responses, temporarily leading to multiple, different Session-
   ID values for the same related early dialogs.  Typically, the UAC 
   would eventually only accept one of the dialogs, and only one 
   Session-ID would remain. 
    
7. New 'Session-ID' Header 
 
   This draft adds the "Session-ID" token to the definition of the 
   element "message-header" in the SIP message grammar.  The Session-ID 
   header is a single-instance header. 
    
7.1. Augmented BNF Definitions 
    
   Session-ID           =  "Session-ID" HCOLON sess-id 
                           *( SEMI generic-param ) 
   sess-id              =  32(DIGIT / %x61-66)  ;32 chars of [0-9a-f] 
    
   NOTE: The sess-id value is technically case-INSENSITIVE, but note 
   that only lower-case characters are allowed. 
    
   See the Security Considerations section for discussion about using 
   header parameters in Session-ID header fields.

8. Example Exchange 
 
   In the following example, Alice initiates a call to Bob.  Alice 
   generates a Session-ID header in the out-of-dialog INVITE. 
    
   Alice generates the following: (note: much has been left out for 
   simplicity) 
      INVITE sip:bob@example.com SIP/2.0 
      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.1:5060;branch=z9hG4bKnashds10 
      From: Alice <sip:alice@example.net>;tag=1234567 
      To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com> 
      Call-Id: 123456mcmxcix@1.2.3.4 
      Session-ID: f81d4fae7dec11d0a76500a0c91e6bf6 
      CSeq: 1 INVITE 
      Contact: <sip:alice@192.168.1.1> 
    
9. Security Considerations 
    
   There are several security considerations surrounding this 
   document's mechanism. 
    
   The Session-ID generation algorithm should provide a reasonably 
   random 16-character Session-ID value, to avoid collisions, and would 
   not let one re-create the original Call-ID. 
    
   There is no known security issue with viewing or modifying the 
   Session-ID, other than to hamper troubleshooting efforts. 
    
9.1. Security considerations for administrators 
    
   The requirement for the Session-ID is to be an identifier which 
   cannot be used by a recipient to identify if the Call-ID has been 
   changed by middle-boxes.  As such, a UAS/UAC cannot detect the 
   original Call-ID, nor whether it has been changed, and thus should 
   not cause administrators concern to be "passed through". 
    
9.2. Security considerations for Session-ID extensions 
    
   The Session-ID's value is created from the Call-ID using a hashing 
   mechanism based on [RFC2104], using SHA-1 and a secret key known 
   only to the system generating the Session-ID.  Because the algorithm 
   is defined in this document, it should be fairly secure from 
   detecting the generator of the Session-ID, in terms of manufacturer 
   or code base. 
    
   The Session-ID generation algorithm should provide a reasonably 
   random 128-bit Session-ID value, to avoid collisions, and would not 
   let one re-create the original Call-ID.  The secret key MUST only be

   used for the Session-ID mechanism, in case a weakness is found which 
   reveals the key.  One such weakness may be that a UAC generates one 
   or more Call-IDs which have a property that makes determining the 
   key more likely. 
    
   In general, B2BUA behavior cannot be dictated by standards.  They do 
   whatever their owners/operators wish them to do, or whatever is 
   necessary to make their applications work.  This document attempts 
   to normatively specify some B2BUA behavior, by creating a SIP header 
   value for which the properties are such that B2BUAs should have no 
   legitimate reason to interfere.  This effectively creates a 
   "promise" that future uses of this Session-ID header field, 
   including its value *and* any future defined parameters, maintain 
   this benign property.  Any future extensions to the Session-ID 
   mechanism and header field MUST maintain this property, or else 
   B2BUAs will begin to modify it again or remove it, and its value 
   will be lost. 
    
   Manufacturers of SIP devices should note that there is no guarantee 
   that a B2BUA will not inspect the Session-ID header field, and 
   remove it if it does not comply with this document's value 
   restrictions.  Any Session-ID header parameters MUST be registered 
   with IANA and documented in IETF RFCs, pursuant to the requirements 
   of [RFC3968]. 
    
10.  IANA Considerations 
    
   This document asks IANA to register a new SIP header field named 
   'Session-ID', pursuant to the registration policies for such in 
   [RFC5727].  This is a single-instance header field, and is 
   appropriate for any SIP message, of any Method type, in any request 
   or response. 
    
   The ABNF rules for this new header allow for header parameters, 
   however they must be registered following the rules of [RFC3968], as 
   required by [RFC5727].

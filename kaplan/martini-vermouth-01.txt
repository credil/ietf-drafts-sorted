Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH             October 2010 


Abstract
    
   The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX 
   type devices to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based 
   Address of Records, using the GIN mechanism defined in [draft-gin].  
   Two other drafts, [draft-olive] and [draft-glass], propose the same 
   for non-E.164-based AoRs.  This document defines a means by which 
   the IP-PBX can verify the resolution entries in the SSP for open-
   ended or full AoRs of any GIN-based mechanism, using a new Event-
   Package named "vermouth".

1. Introduction 
    
   In many deployed SIP Service Provider (SSP) architectures, it is 
   common to use REGISTER requests to provide the reachability 
   information for IP-PBXs, instead of DNS-based resolution and 
   routing.  An IETF-defined mechanism for doing so is defined in 
   [draft-gin].  Another draft, [draft-olive], uses the [draft-gin] GIN 
   mechanism for Local-Number AoRs as well; and a new draft [draft-
   glass] does the same for literal alpha-numeric/email-style AoRs.

Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH             October 2010 
 
 
    
   In all cases, the IP-PBX or another SIP entity may wish to learn 
   about all of the AoRs which were implicitly Registered by [draft-
   gin] or [draft-olive], or to learn about changes in their 
   provisioned AoRs through asynchronous notifications.  Even in non-
   Registration scenarios, where requests for specific AoRs in a SSP 
   may instead be statically routed to an IP-PBX, it may be useful for 
   the IP-PBX to learn what those AoRs are in order to detect 
   mismatches or changes. 
    
   In theory, the [draft-gin] mechanism is simply a short-hand single 
   REGISTER transaction for a bulk set of AoRs in lieu of multiple, 
   separate REGISTER transactions for each AoR.  In practice, however, 
   the E.164 user numbers may be an "open" numbering plan/range, such 
   that the SSP only really knows about a certain number of digits and 
   the rest are only known to the IP-PBX.  Likewise, when [draft-olive] 
   is used, the Local-Number may be only partially known to the SSP. 
    
   Therefore, it is not possible for the SSP to actually provide state 
   information for each possible unique AoR instance.  Instead, it 
   needs to provide an indication for the registration state of the 
   prefix or digit portion it does know about. 
    
   This document proposes to provide such information using a new 
   Event-Package. 
 
2. Definitions 
    
   For brevity's sake, this document uses the word "request" instead of 
   "out-of-dialog request", but in all case means out-of-dialog 
   request. 
 
   AoR: address-of-record, as defined by RFC 3261: a URI by which the 
   user is canonically known (e.g., on their business cards, in the 
   From header field of their requests, in the To header field of 
   REGISTER requests, etc.). 
    
   Bulk-AoR: a SIP or SIPS address-of-record with a "range" URI user 
   parameter which expands the user string based on a heuristic. 
    
   Local-Number: an AoR which follows the form of local-number in 
   [RFC3966], but may be encoded in a SIP or TEL URI.  The local-number 
   contains a 'phone-context' parameter identifying the scope of its 
   number. 
    
   Email-style URI: a SIP AoR which does not identify a global E.164 
   number or Local-Number.

   Implicit Registration: implicitly providing the reachability 
   information for something other than the AoR explicitly indicated in 
   the Register transaction. 
    
   Reachability Information: a set of URI's identifying the host and 
   path of Proxies to reach that host; like any URI, these URI's may 
   identify the specific connection transport, IP Address, and port 
   information, or they may only identify FQDN's. 
    
   SSP: SIP Service Provider, as defined by [RFC5486]. 
    
3. The Solution - an Overview 
    
   The general concept is a SIP device, such as an IP-PBX, Subscribes 
   to a new "vermouth" Event-Package by issuing a SUBSCRIBE request 
   targeted at the SIP URI AoR it explicitly registered using GIN, or 
   some other mutually-agreed-upon SIP-URI if GIN was not used.    
    
   If the Subscription is successful, the returned NOTIFY contains a 
   userinfo XML document that lists all of the usernames of the AoR's 
   domain that the SSP will route to the IP-PBX.  The XML document does 
   not contain the Contact/Path routing reachability information, since 
   that information is already in the reg-event package information for 
   the explicitly registered AoR of the IP-PBX, and may also be more 
   sensitive in nature. 
    
   To handle the open-numbering-plan problem, an XML "range" attribute 
   is used, which is similar to a regular expression pattern but with a 
   very limited, specified syntax.  The limited syntax is used to avoid 
   ambiguities and reduce confusion - rationale for this is provided in 
   Appendix A.  
    
   Furthermore, this document specifies that the To-URI used for the 
   [draft-gin] REGISTER request, be usable as the target for the 
   SUBSCRIBE request, both for the new 'vermouth' Event-Package, and 
   for Subscribing to the [RFC3680] registration event-package for that 
   explicitly registered AoR. 
    
4. Event Package Definition 
    
   This section fills in the details needed to specify an event package 
   as defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC3265]. 
    
4.1. Event Package Name 
    
   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to specify 
   the name of their package or template-package. 
    

 
 
Kaplan                   Expires - April 2011                 [Page 4] 











Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH             October 2010 
 
 
   The name of this package is "vermouth".  As specified in [RFC3265], 
   this value appears in the Event header present in SUBSCRIBE and 
   NOTIFY requests. 
    
4.2. Event Package Parameters 
    
   The SIP Events specification requires package and template-package 
   definitions to specify any package specific parameters of the Event 
   header that are used by it. 
    
   No package specific Event header parameters are defined for this 
   event package. 
    
4.3. SUBSCRIBE Bodies 
    
   The SIP Events specification requires package or template-package 
   definitions to define the usage, if any, of bodies in SUBSCRIBE 
   requests. 
    
   A SUBSCRIBE for registration events MAY contain a body. This body 
   would serve the purpose of filtering the subscription. The 
   definition of such a body is outside the scope of this 
   specification. 
    
   A SUBSCRIBE for the registration package MAY be sent without a body. 
   This implies that the default registration filtering policy has been 
   requested. The default policy is: 
    
     o Notifications are generated every time there is any change in 
     the state of any of the registered contacts for the resource being 
     subscribed to. Those notifications only contain information on the 
     contacts whose state has changed. 
      
     o Notifications triggered from a SUBSCRIBE contain full state (the 
     list of all contacts bound to the address-of-record). 
    
   Of course, the server can apply any policy it likes to the 
   subscription. 
    
4.4. Subscription Duration 
    
   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to define 
   a default value for subscription durations, and to discuss 
   reasonable choices for durations when they are explicitly specified. 
    
   The Event Package defined herein is not tied to registration state, 
   nor to any value that has natural expiry times.  Therefore, the 
   suggested subscription duration is 86400 seconds (1 day).

Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH             October 2010 
 
 
   Of course, clients MAY include an Expires header in the SUBSCRIBE 
   request asking for a different duration. 
    
4.5. NOTIFY Bodies 
    
   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to 
   describe the allowed set of body types in NOTIFY requests, and to 
   specify the default value to be used when there is no Accept header 
   in the SUBSCRIBE request. 
    
   The body of a notification of a change in provisioned usernames 
   contains a user information document.  This document describes some 
   or all of the username expansions associated with the particular 
   address-of-record subscribed to.  All subscribers and notifiers MUST 
   support the "application/userinfo+xml" format described in Section 
   5. The subscribe request MAY contain an Accept header field. If no 
   such header field is present, it has a default value of 
   "application/userinfo+xml". If the header field is present, it MUST 
   include "application/userinfo+xml", and MAY include any other types 
   capable of representing registration information. 
    
   Of course, the notifications generated by the server MUST be in one 
   of the formats specified in the Accept header field in the SUBSCRIBE 
   request. 
    
4.6. Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests 
    
   The SIP Events framework specifies that packages should define any 
   package-specific processing of SUBSCRIBE requests at a notifier, 
   specifically with regards to authentication and authorization. 
    
   Provisioned usernames can be sensitive information.  Therefore, all 
   subscriptions to it SHOULD be authenticated and authorized before 
   approval.  Authentication MAY be performed using any of the 
   techniques available through SIP, including digest, S/MIME, TLS or 
   other transport specific mechanisms [1].  Authorization policy is at 
   the discretion of the administrator, as always.  However, a few 
   recommendations can be made. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that an IP-PBX be allowed to subscribe to its own 
   provisioned usernames.  Such subscriptions are useful for detecting 
   errors and changes. 
    
4.7. Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests 
    
   The SIP Event framework requests that packages specify the 
   conditions under which notifications are sent for that package, and 
   how such notifications are constructed. 
    
 
 
Kaplan                   Expires - April 2011                 [Page 6] 











Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH             October 2010 
 
 
    
   Instead of delivering the full list every time a notification is 
   sent, it is RECOMMENDED that notifications only list the username 
   entries that have changed state (i.e., been added or removed).  
    
   Notifications triggered as a result of a fetch operation (a 
   SUBSCRIBE with Expires of 0) or a new Subscription SHOULD result in 
   the full list of all usernames to be present in the NOTIFY. 
    
4.8. Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests 
    
   The SIP Events framework expects packages to specify how a 
   subscriber processes NOTIFY requests in any package specific ways, 
   and in particular, how it uses the NOTIFY requests to construct a 
   coherent view of the state of the subscribed resource.  
    
   Typically, the NOTIFY will only contain information for usernames 
   whose state has changed.  To construct a coherent view of the total 
   state of all usernames, the subscriber will need to combine NOTIFYs 
   received over time.  The details of this process depend on the 
   document format used to convey registration state.  Section 5 
   outlines the process for the application/userinfo+xml format. 
    
4.9. Handling of Forked Requests 
    
   The SIP Events framework mandates that packages indicate whether or 
   not forked SUBSCRIBE requests can install multiple subscriptions. 
    
   Provisioned usernames are normally stored in some repository 
   (whether it be co-located with a proxy/registrar or in a separate 
   database).  As such, there is usually a single place where the 
   username information for a particular address-of-record is resident. 
   This implies that a subscription for this information is readily 
   handled by a single element with access to this repository. There 
   is, therefore, no compelling need for a subscription to username 
   information to fork. As a result, a subscriber MUST NOT create 
   multiple dialogs as a result of a single subscription request. The 
   required processing to guarantee that only a Section 4.4.9 of the 
   SIP single dialog is established is described in Events framework 
   [RFC3265]. 
    
4.10.     Rate of Notifications 
    
   The SIP Events framework mandates that packages define a maximum 
   rate of notifications for their package. 
    
   For reasons of congestion control, it is important that the rate of 
   notifications not become excessive.  As a result, it is RECOMMENDED 

 
 
Kaplan                   Expires - April 2011                 [Page 7] 











Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH             October 2010 
 
 
   that the server not generate notifications for a single subscriber 
   at a rate faster than once every 5 seconds. 
    
4.11.     State Agents 
    
   The SIP Events framework asks packages to consider the role of state 
   agents in their design. 
    
   State agents have no role in the handling of this package. 
    
    
5. Username Information 
    
5.1. Structure of Username Information 
    
   Username information is an XML document [4] that MUST be well-formed 
   and SHOULD be valid.  Username information documents MUST be based 
   on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  This specification 
   makes use of XML namespaces for identifying registration information 
   documents and document fragments.  The namespace URI for elements 
   defined by this specification is a URN [5], using the namespace 
   identifier ietf defined by [6] and extended by [7]. This URN is: 
    
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:userinfo 
    
   A username information document begins with the root element tag 
   "userinfo".  It consists of any number of "userlist" sub-elements, 
   each of which contains the provisioning state for a particular list 
   of usernames, associated with the address-of-record subscribed to.  
   The username information for a particular address-of-record MUST be 
   contained within a single "userlist" element; it cannot be spread 
   across multiple "userlist" elements within a document.  Other 
   elements from different namespaces MAY be present for the purposes 
   of extensibility; elements or attributes from unknown namespaces 
   MUST be ignored.  
    
   There are two attributes associated with the "userinfo" element, 
   both of which MUST be present: 
    
    version: This attribute allows the recipient of username 
    information documents to properly order them.  Versions start at 0, 
    and increment by one for each new document sent to a subscriber. 
    Versions are scoped within a subscription. Versions MUST be 
    representable using a 32 bit integer. 
     
    state: This attribute indicates whether the document contains the 
    full list of provisioned usernames, or whether it contains only 
    information on those registrations which have changed since the 
    previous document (partial). 
 
 
Kaplan                   Expires - April 2011                 [Page 8] 











Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH             October 2010 
 
 
    
   Note that the document format explicitly allows for conveying 
   information on multiple addresses-of-record.  This enables 
   subscriptions to groups of usernames, where such a group is 
   identified by some kind of URI.  For example, a domain might define 
   sip:allusers@example.com as a subscribe-able resource that generates 
   notifications when the provisioning state of any address-of-record 
   in the domain changes. 
    
   The "userlist" element has a list of any number of "user" sub-
   elements, each of which contains information on a single username 
   entry, which may itself be a range-patterned name.  Other elements 
   from different namespaces MAY be present for the purposes of 
   extensibility; elements or attributes from unknown namespaces MUST 
   be ignored.  
    
   There are three attributes associated with the "userlist" element, 
   all of which MUST be present: 
    
     aor:   The aor attribute contains a URI which is the address-of- 
     record this list is associated with. 
      
     id: The id attribute identifies this list. It MUST be unique 
     amongst all other id attributes present in other userlist elements 
     conveyed to the subscriber within the scope of their subscription. 
     Furthermore, the id attribute for a "userlist" element for a 
     particular address-of-record MUST be the same across all 
     notifications sent within the subscription. 
      
     state: The state attribute indicates the state of the username 
     list. The valid values are "active" and "removed". 
    
   The "user" element contains the username.  There are several 
   attributes associated with the "contact" element which MUST be 
   present: 
    
     id: The id attribute identifies this user name. It MUST be unique 
     amongst all other id attributes present in other user elements 
     conveyed to the subscriber within the scope of their subscription.  
      
     state: The state attribute indicates the state of the user name. 
     The valid values are "active" and "removed". 
      
     type: The type attribute identifies the user name type.  Valid 
     values are "e614", "private", and "alpha". 
      
     range: the range attribute is defined in the next section.

Internet-Draft           SIP MARTINI VERMOUTH             October 2010 
 
 
     context: the context attribute is only meaningful when the type 
     attribute is "private", and in such a case the context identifies 
     the context of the private name space. 
    
    
5.2. The "range" Attribute 
    
   The range attribute's value defines the expansion of the username, 
   using a syntax similar to regular expressions.  The range pattern 
   applies after the last character of the user element's value. 
    
   range-value    = exp-char-set exp-char-count  
    
   exp-char-set   = digit-char-set / any-char-set 
   digit-char-set = "[" dsc-begin "-" dsc-end "]" 
   dsc-begin      = DIGIT 
   dsc-end        = DIGIT 
   any-char-set   = "." 
    
   exp-char-count = "{" exp-min "," exp-max "}" 
   exp-min        = DIGIT 
   exp-max        = DIGIT 
    
   The "digit-char-set" defines a range of digit characters, for 
   example 0-9 or 3-5, inclusive.  The "dsc-begin" digit value must be 
   less than or equal to the "dsc-end" digit value. 
    
   The "any-char-set" defines any single character allowed in the 
   'user' token field of [RFC3261]. 
    
   The "exp-char-count" defines a minimum and maximum number of times a 
   character within the exp-char-set may be repeated, inclusive.  The 
   "exp-min" digit value must be less than or equal to the "exp-max" 
   digit value.

6. Examples 
    
   Detailed scenario examples will be provided once the WG decides 
   which way to go with this mechanism. 
    
   The following is an example username information document: 
      
     <?xml version="1.0"?>  
          
         <userinfo xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:userinfo" 
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
            version="23" state="full">

Appendix A - Rationale for Constraining the Expansion Pattern 
    
   This document's mechanism defines a limited set of patterns which 
   may be used in the "<expansion>" portion of the Bulk-AoR.  This is 
   in contrast to the "Wildcarded AoR" mechanism used in some 
   deployments, which use any regular expressions (regex) for the

   pattern.  One of the reasons this document restricts the regex 
   syntax is to maintain [RFC3261] compliance, which does not allow 
   common regex characters such as '^', '[', ']','{', and '}' to appear 
   in SIP URIs.   
    
   The other reason this document does not use any arbitrary regex is 
   that one of the goals of this document is to be useful for an IP-PBX 
   to determine provisioning mismatches.  An arbitrary regex is 
   typically useful for verifying a given input string matches the 
   pattern, and not for actually determining the complete set of 
   strings the regex pattern implies.  In other words, a regex is 
   useful for authenticating a given number matches the pattern, but 
   not for determining what all of the provisioned numbers are.  
    
   For example, a regex syntax model for "sip:1234![5-9][0-
   9]*!@example.com" is useful for checking if "sip:123456@example.com" 
   is a matching number, but is extremely difficult for an IP-PBX to 
   verify that the SSP does not include numbers the PBX does not have 
   provisioned.  The IP-PBX could check each of its locally provisioned 
   numbers against the regex pattern, but has no clean way to determine 
   if the set allowed by the regex is not *greater* than its locally 
   provisioned set.   
    
   Furthermore, numerous regex patterns can be used to mean the exact 
   same set.  For example "sip:1234!(5|6|7|8|9)[0-9]*!@example.com", 
   "sip:1234![5-9][0-9]{0,}!@example.com", "sip:1234![5-
   9][[:digits:]]*!@example.com", and "sip:123!4[5-9][0-
   9]*!@example.com" all represent the same set of user strings as the 
   first regex example. 
    
   Therefore, to avoid such issues, this document uses a very narrow 
   set of possible "patterns", which can be used for both matching and 
   provisioning verification.

          Logging recommendations for Internet facing servers
             draft-durand-server-logging-recommendations-00

Abstract

   In the wake of IPv4 exhaustion and deployment of IP address sharing
   techniques, this document recommends that Internet facing servers log
   port number and accurate timestamps in addition to the incoming IP
   address.

1.  Introduction

   According to the most recent predictions, the global IPv4 address
   free pool at IANA will exhaust sometime in 2011.  After that, service
   providers will have a hard time finding enough IPv4 global addresses
   to sustain product and subscriber growth.  Due to the huge global
   existing infrastructure, both hardware and software, vendors and
   service providers must continue to support IPv4 technologies for the
   foreseeable future.  As legacy applications and hardware are retired
   the reliance on IPv4 will diminish but this is a years long perhaps
   decades long process.

   To maintain legacy IPv4 address support, service providers will have
   little choice but to share IPv4 global addresses among multiple
   customers.  Techniques to do so are outside of the scope of this
   documents.  All include some form of address translation/address
   sharing, being NAT44, NAT64 or DS-Lite.

   The effects on the Internet of the introduction of those address
   sharing techniques have been documented in
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues].

   Address sharing techniques come with their own logging infrastructure
   to track the relation between which original IP address and source
   port(s) were associated with which user and external IPv4 address at
   any given point in time.  In the past to support abuse mitigation or
   public safety requests, the knowledge of the external global IP
   address was enough to identify a subscriber of interest.  With
   address sharing technologies, only providing information about the
   external public address associated with a session to a service
   provider is no longer sufficient information to unambiguously
   identify customers.

   Note: this document provides recommendations for Internet facing
   servers logging incoming connections.  Its does not provide any
   recommendations about logging on carrier-grade NAT or other address
   sharing tools.


2.  Recommendations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   It is RECOMMENDED as best current practice that Internet facing
   servers logging incoming IP addresses also log:

   o  The source port number.

   o  A timestamp accurate to the second, with associated time zone.

   o  The transport protocol (usually TCP or UDP) and destination port
      number, when the server application is defined to use multiple
      transports or multiple ports.

   Discussion: Carrier-grade NATs may have different policies to recycle
   ports, some implementations may decide to reuse ports almost
   immediately, some may wait several minutes before marking the port
   ready for reuse.  As a result, servers have no idea how fast the
   ports will be reused and, thus, should log timestamps using a
   reasonably accurate clock.  At this point the RECOMMENDED accuracy
   for timestamps is to the second or better.

   Examples of Internet facing servers include, but are not limited to,
   web servers and email servers.

   Although the deployment of address sharing techniques is not
   immediately foreseen in IPv6, the above recommendations apply to both
   IPv4 and IPv6, if only for consistency and code simplification
   reasons.

   Discussions about data retention policies are out of scope for this
   document.


3.  ISP Considerations

   ISP deploying IP address sharing techniques should also deploy a
   corresponding logging architecture to maintain records of the
   relation between customers identity and IP/port resources they
   utilize.  However, recommendation on this topic are out of scope for
   this document.


4.  IANA Considerations

   None.


5.  Security Considerations

   In the absence of source port number and accurate timestamp,
   operators deploying any address sharing techniques will not be able
   to identify unambiguously customers when dealing with abuse or public
   safety queries.

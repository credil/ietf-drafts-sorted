		<abstract>
			<t> RFC 5965 defines an extensible, machine-readable format intended for mail operators to report feedback about received email 
			to other parties.  This document describes how this format is utilized for reporting at scale between large mailbox providers,
			and from large mailbox providers to other sending entities. </t>
		</abstract>
		
		<note title="Applicability Statement?">
			<t> [RFC Editor: please remove this section prior to publication.] </t>
			
			<t> This document is part of the experiment to reintroduce Applicability Statements, as defined in 
			section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC2026"/>, to the Applications Area. </t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t> The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) was initially developed for two very specific use cases.  First and foremost, it was 
				intended to be used for reporting feedback between large email operators or from large email operators to end user
				network access operators, who could be presumed to have automated abuse-handling systems.  Secondarily, it is used by 
				those same large mail operators to send those same reports to other entities, including those involved in sending bulk 
				email for commercial purposes.  In both cases, the reports would be triggered by an end user action such as clicking 
				on a "report spam" button in their email client. </t>
				
			<t> Though other uses for the format defined in <xref target="RFC5965"/> have been developed (and may be documented
				similarly in the future), those were (and remain) the primary applications. </t>
				
			<t> Further introduction to this topic may be found in <xref target="I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp"/>. </t>
			
			<section title="Definitions">
				<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
					"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
        			this document are to be interpreted as described in
        			<xref target="RFC2119"/>, and are intended to replace the Requirement Levels described in
					section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC2026"/>. </t>
				
				<t> Some of the terminology used in this document is taken from <xref target="RFC5598"/>. </t>
								
				<t> "Mailbox Provider" refers to an organization that accepts, stores, and offers access to 
					<xref target="RFC5322"/> messages ("email messages") for end users.  Such an organization MUST have implemented
					SMTP (<xref target="RFC5321"/>), and MAY provide access to messages through IMAP (<xref target="RFC3501"/>), 
					POP (<xref target="RFC1939"/>), a proprietary interface designed for HTTP (<xref target="RFC2616"/>), or a
					proprietary protocol. </t>

			<section title="Discussion">
				<t> [RFC Editor: please remove this section prior to publication.] </t>
				
				<t> This document is being discussed within the IETF MARF Working Group, on the marf@ietf.org mailing list. </t>

		<section title="Creating and Sending Reports">
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t> A Mailbox Provider receives reports of abusive or unwanted mail from their users, most often by providing 
						a "report spam" button (or similar nomenclature) in the MUA.  The method of transferring this message and
						any associated metadata from the MUA to the Mailbox Provider's ARF processing system is not defined, but
						is discussed further in section 3.2 of <xref target="I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp"/>.  Policy concerns related
						to the collection of this data are discussed in section 3.4 of <xref target="I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp"/>. </t>
						
					<t> The Mailbox Provider SHOULD process the reports to improve their spam filtering systems.  The design of
						these systems is discussed in <xref target="RFC2505"/> and elsewhere. </t>
							
					<t> The Mailbox Provider SHOULD (but is not required to) send reports to relevant parties who have requested
						to receive such reports.  The reports MUST be formatted per <xref target="RFC5965"/>, and transmitted as an
						<xref target="RFC5322"/> message using <xref target="RFC5321"/>. The process whereby such parties may request 
						the reports is discussed in section 3.5 of <xref target="I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp"/>. </t>
							
					<t> Ongoing maintenance of an ARF processing system is discussed in section 3.6 of
						<xref target="I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp"/>. </t>

		<section title="Receiving and Processing Reports">
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t> At the time this document is being written, for the use cases described here, mail operators need to proactively
						request a stream of ARF reports from Mailbox Providers.	Recommendations for preparing to make that request are
						discussed in section 4.1 of <xref target="I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp"/>. </t>
						
					<t> Mail operators MUST be prepared to receive reports formatted per <xref target="RFC5965"/> as
						<xref target="RFC5322"/> messages via <xref target="RFC5321"/>.  These and other types of
						<xref target="RFC5322"/> messages which may be received at discussed in section 4.2 of
						<xref target="I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp"/>. </t>
						
					<t> Mail operators SHOULD utilize an automated system to receive and process these reports, as discussed in 
						section 4.4 of <xref target="I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp"/>. </t>
						
					<t> Actions that mail operators MAY take upon receiving a report (or multiple reports) are discussed in
						section 4.3 of <xref target="I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp"/>. </t>

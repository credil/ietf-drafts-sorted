 Creation and Use of Email Feedback Reports: An Applicability Statement

                        draft-jdfalk-marf-as-00

Abstract

   RFC 5965 defines an extensible, machine-readable format intended for
   mail operators to report feedback about received email to other
   parties.  This document describes how this format is utilized for
   reporting at scale between large mailbox providers, and from large
   mailbox providers to other sending entities.

Applicability Statement?

   [RFC Editor: please remove this section prior to publication.]

   This document is part of the experiment to reintroduce Applicability
   Statements, as defined in section 3.2 of [RFC2026], to the
   Applications Area.

1.  Introduction

   The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) was initially developed for two very
   specific use cases.  First and foremost, it was intended to be used
   for reporting feedback between large email operators or from large
   email operators to end user network access operators, who could be
   presumed to have automated abuse-handling systems.  Secondarily, it
   is used by those same large mail operators to send those same reports
   to other entities, including those involved in sending bulk email for
   commercial purposes.  In both cases, the reports would be triggered
   by an end user action such as clicking on a "report spam" button in
   their email client.

   Though other uses for the format defined in [RFC5965] have been
   developed (and may be documented similarly in the future), those were
   (and remain) the primary applications.

   Further introduction to this topic may be found in
   [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].

1.1.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119], and are
   intended to replace the Requirement Levels described in section 3.3
   of [RFC2026].

   Some of the terminology used in this document is taken from
   [RFC5598].

   "Mailbox Provider" refers to an organization that accepts, stores,
   and offers access to [RFC5322] messages ("email messages") for end
   users.  Such an organization MUST have implemented SMTP ([RFC5321]),
   and MAY provide access to messages through IMAP ([RFC3501]), POP
   ([RFC1939]), a proprietary interface designed for HTTP ([RFC2616]),
   or a proprietary protocol.

1.2.  Discussion

   [RFC Editor: please remove this section prior to publication.]

   This document is being discussed within the IETF MARF Working Group,
   on the marf@ietf.org mailing list.


2.  Creating and Sending Reports

   1.  A Mailbox Provider receives reports of abusive or unwanted mail
       from their users, most often by providing a "report spam" button
       (or similar nomenclature) in the MUA.  The method of transferring
       this message and any associated metadata from the MUA to the
       Mailbox Provider's ARF processing system is not defined, but is
       discussed further in section 3.2 of [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].
       Policy concerns related to the collection of this data are
       discussed in section 3.4 of [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].
   2.  The Mailbox Provider SHOULD process the reports to improve their
       spam filtering systems.  The design of these systems is discussed
       in [RFC2505] and elsewhere.
   3.  The Mailbox Provider SHOULD (but is not required to) send reports
       to relevant parties who have requested to receive such reports.
       The reports MUST be formatted per [RFC5965], and transmitted as
       an [RFC5322] message using [RFC5321].  The process whereby such
       parties may request the reports is discussed in section 3.5 of
       [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].
   4.  Ongoing maintenance of an ARF processing system is discussed in
       section 3.6 of [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].


3.  Receiving and Processing Reports

   1.  At the time this document is being written, for the use cases
       described here, mail operators need to proactively request a
       stream of ARF reports from Mailbox Providers.  Recommendations
       for preparing to make that request are discussed in section 4.1
       of [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].
   2.  Mail operators MUST be prepared to receive reports formatted per
       [RFC5965] as [RFC5322] messages via [RFC5321].  These and other
       types of [RFC5322] messages which may be received at discussed in
       section 4.2 of [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].
   3.  Mail operators SHOULD utilize an automated system to receive and
       process these reports, as discussed in section 4.4 of
       [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].
   4.  Actions that mail operators MAY take upon receiving a report (or
       multiple reports) are discussed in section 4.3 of
       [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].

4.  Acknowledgements

   This document is a product of the IETF MARF Working Group, chaired by
   Barry Leiba and Murray Kucherawy.  The idea to present it in the form
   of an Applicability Statement originated (I believe) with Pete
   Resnick.

   All of the Best Practices referenced by this document are found in
   [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp], written within the Collaboration
   Committee of the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG), which is
   described further in [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].

   Finally, I must thank the doctors and staff at the University of
   Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for reasons which need not be
   explored here.

6.  Security Considerations

   Implementers are urged to review, at a minimum, the Security
   Considerations sections of [RFC5965] and [I-D.jdfalk-maawg-cfblbcp].

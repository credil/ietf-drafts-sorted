Editors' Note:

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an
   IETF Last Call.

   the published RFC has IETF Consensus.]

1. Introduction

   As noted in the multi-protocol label switching (MPLS-TP)
   Framework RFCs (RFC 5921 [5] and [6]), MPLS-TP is a packet-based
   transport technology based on the MPLS Traffic Engineering
   (MPLS-TE) and Pseudo Wire (PW) data plane architectures defined
   in RFC 3031 [1], RFC 3985 [2] and RFC 5659 [3] applicable in any
   packet network context.

   A subset of MPLS-TP is also applicable to ITU-T-defined packet
   transport networks (PTN), where the transport network
   operational model is deemed attractive.

   When MPLS-TP is deployed in PTN environment, application
   specific mechanisms (e.g., OAM) are required to allow service
   providers retaining the same operational experience in the MPLS-
   TP network as they had in their existing Synchronous Optical
   Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) and Optical
   Transport Network (OTN) networks.

   When MPLS-TP is deployed in other environments, e.g. in a Packet
   Switched Network (PSN), application specific mechanisms (e.g.,
   OAM) are required to allow service providers retaining the same
   operational experience in the MPLS-TP network as they had in
   their existing IP and MPLS networks.

   The standard MPLS-TP toolkit has to serve the interests of both
   communities of users.

   The standardization of the OAM toolset has not met the market
   needs of some PTN operators. Recognizing that it is very
   important for ITU-T and IETF to provide timely solutions to
   maintain support for the MPLS-TP agreements, the development
   of PTN application specific functions within ITU-T will allow
   ITU-T to satisfy the urgent needs expressed at the June 2010
   Study Group 15 meeting.

   Allocation of one Associated Channel Type value will allow ITU-T
   to develop the tools required to address the unique needs of PTN
   application and will make more efficient use of the resources of
   both organizations while providing a mechanism to prevent the
   accidental interconnection between PTN and PSN application
   specific tools. The use of this code point fully complies with
   the framework and architecture for MPLS-TP.

   This document describes the allocation of an Associated Channel
   Type to support ITU-T defined functions for packet transport
   network applications, such as Operations, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM), and applicable to MPLS-TP Pseudowires (PWs),
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs), Sub-path Maintenance Elements
   (SPMEs) and Sections.

   This document is intended to become a product of a joint
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
   Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector
   (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the
   IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and
   functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the
   ITU-T.

1.1. PTN Application Description

   In this application MPLS-TP will be used to add packet transport
   capability to an existing circuit switched (SDH/OTN) transport
   network.  A Transport Network is a connection oriented network that
   support transport paths that provides connectivity between service
   switches.  Currently only point to point co-routed bidirectional
   transport paths are supported.  It is expected that support for uni-
   directional point to point and uni-directional point to multipoint
   transport paths will be added in the future.

   A key characteristic for the transport network is the independence
   between services and transport i.e. the transport network is service
   agnostic.  In the context of MPLS-TP the transport network provides a
   transport path for a PW or a LSP.

   Within a transport network multi technology transport nodes that
   support a combination of MPLS-TP, Ethernet, OTN and SDH transport
   technologies are typically deployed. Multiple transport layer
   networks may be supported by a common node.  Note that in many
   existing transport networks, Ethernet technology has been already
   deployed to address some of the needs for packet transport
   capability. Ethernet is also a primary packet transport service for

   PTN.  In this application, the primary requirements are driven by a
   desire for compatibility and consistency with the existing transport
   network operational behaviour, operational functionality and
   operational processes.  In particular compatibility with the existing
   OAM and protection switching paradigm for SDH, OTN, Ethernet (i.e.,
   provide the same controls and indications).

   Compatibility (consistency) means that the same management
   information model is used.  This enables upgrades of the OSS infra
   structure in which it is only necessary to recognize the new type of
   layer network technology.

   It is also important to minimize the impact on the workforce that
   operates the existing transport network (e.g., the retraining
   required to add MPLS-TP to a network should be about the same as the
   retraining required when OTN is added to an SDH network).

1.2. Support for multiple applications

   Multiple applications are commonly supported from a single toolkit
   within the MPLS suite of protocols, with extensions that are applied
   to specific applications.

   As a consequence, the MPLS architecture allows multiple protocols to
   perform the same function for different network applications; e.g.

   o  Three different label distribution protocols (LDP, RSVP-TE, BGP)

   o  Two different routing protocols (OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE)

   o  Three different VCCV types

   For any given application, a subset of protocols are implemented;
   e.g.,

   o  LDP is used for connectionless MPLS,

   o  RSVP-TE is used for connection-oriented MPLS

   o  BGP is used with L2 and L3 VPNs

   There are no MPLS architecture barriers to allowing different
   protocols for network operations in "PTN" and "PSN" applications
   while the operational requirement in these two applications domains
   are sufficiently distinct to justify such an approach.

2.2. Definitions

   This document uses the term LSP to indicate either a service LSP or a
   transport LSP (as defined in RFC 5921 [5]).

   This document uses the terms Section and Sub Path Maintenance
   Element (SPME) as defined in RFC 5921 [5].

3. Usage of the Associated Channel Type allocated for PTN

   The usage of the associated channel type allocated for PTN
   applications will fully comply with the MPLS-TP data plane
   architecture and framework as described in RFC 5960 [7], RFC 5586
   [4], RFC 5921 [5] and RFC 6215 [6].

4. Compatibility Considerations

   As described in section 5 of RFC 5586 [4], an LER, LSR or PE that are
   not capable to processing packets on the Associated Channel Type
   allocated for PTN applications discards such packets when all the
   MPLS or PW labels have been popped.

5. Interconnection of PTN and PSN networks

   PTN and PSN networks can be interconnected together. Three scenarios
   for interconnection are described in this section.

5.1. PTN client over a PSN server

   In this case a LSP originates and terminates in a PTN network and
   crosses a PSN network. The end to end PTN LSP runs as a client over
   the PSN network.  In this case the PSN network must provide an
   appropriate class of service for the PTN LSP, e.g. it should use
   MPLS-TP or MPLS-TE. This is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

   Support of a PTN MIP within the PSN network is optional. Support of
   PTN alarm and lock reporting within the PSN network is optional.

5.2. PSN client over a PTN server

   In this case a LSP originates and terminates in a PSN network and
   crosses a PTN network.  The end to end PSN LSP runs as a client over
   the PTN network.  This is illustrated in Figure 2 below.

   Support of a PSN MIP within the PTN network is optional. Support of
   PSN alarm and lock reporting within the PTN network is optional.

5.3. LSP or PW originating in a PTN network and terminating in a PSN
   network

   In this case the PW (or LSP) originates (or terminates) in a PTN and
   terminates (or originates) in a PSN.  The default OAM for the end to
   end LSP or PW is PSN.  PTN OAM may be used if the network operators
   mutually agree to select this option.  The default option is
   illustrated in Figure 3 below.

   In this case the PTN network is required to support PSN OAM for the
   termination or origination of an end to end LSP or PW.  Support of
   the PSN MIP function in the PTN network is optional.

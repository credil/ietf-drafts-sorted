1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Several organizations (Project Honeypot, Spamhaus, RepuScore, etc.)
   maintain databases detailing the reputation of various IP address.
   These organizations use various ad hoc methods to collect the
   reputation data.  There is no standard for reporting events to
   reputation-collectors; this makes it hard to instrument a large
   number of systems to be data gatherers in a standard way.

   This draft proposes a standard for reporting events back to a
   reputation-collecting system.  A standard way to report events will
   make it easy to instrument systems to collect data and report it to
   one or more reputation-collection systems.

   This standard has the following goals:

   1.  To be bandwidth-efficient.  The overhead for event-reporting
       should be as small as possible.
   2.  To include security mechanisms such as authentication and anti-
       replay mechanisms.
   3.  To handle both IPv4 and IPv6.
   4.  To be open to extension in future.

   This protocol is currently in use by Roaring Penguin Software Inc's
   CanIt anti-spam products.  A web page devoted to the protocol is
   found at http://www.mimedefang.org/reputation; this page includes a
   link to a mailing list for discussions of the protocol.


3.  Definitions

   An EVENT is the basic unit of reputation reporting.  An event
   consists of an IPv4 or IPv6 address and an associated event TYPE.
   Examples of event types are "SMTP client at IP address issued an SMTP
   RCPT command for a nonexistent recipient" or "SMTP client at IP
   address delivered an email message considered by a human to be spam."

   A SUBREPORT is usually a list of one or more events.  However, a
   subreport may contain other types of information such as software
   name, version, etc.

Internet-Draft        Reputation Reporting Protocol            June 2010


   A SENSOR is a system that reports events.

   An AGGREGATOR is a system that receives events and builds a
   reputation database.

   A REPORT is a series of subreports sent from a sensor to an
   aggregator.

   A USER NAME is included in each report.  The user name is a key used
   by the aggregator to look up a shared secret.

   A SHARED SECRET is used by the sensor and aggregator to authenticate
   reports.

   A REPUTATION DATABASE is a dictionary indexed by IPv4 or IPv6 address
   that contains reputation information about a particular IP address.
   Note that the exact format of the reputation database as well as what
   constitutes "reputation" are beyond the scope of this document.  We
   are concerned only with a standard for reporting events.


4.  Report Format

   Reports are transported via UDP.  The aggregator SHOULD listen for
   UDP packets on port 6568, the IANA-assigned port number for this
   protocol [PORTS].

   A report consists of the following items:

   o  A one-byte protocol version number.  The version number is 2.  An
      aggregator MUST ignore a report with a version number other than
      2.
   o  A one-byte number indicating the length of a user name.  A
      username MUST range from 0 to 63 bytes in length.  An aggregator
      MUST reject a report with an over-long user name.
   o  A sequence of bytes indicating a user name.  This name is not
      terminated with a zero byte.  While this document does not specify
      the form of a user name, it SHOULD be a valid UTF-8 string.
   o  Eight randomly-generated bytes.  These bytes SHOULD be generated
      with a cryptographically-secure random number generator.
   o  A four-byte timestamp in network byte order.  This is constructed
      by computing the current time in seconds since midnight, January 1
      1970 UTC as an unsigned integer, and taking the low-order 32 bits
      of the result.
   o  One or more SUBREPORTS.
   o  Finally, ten bytes consisting of the ten most-significant bytes
      (in network byte order) of the SHA1 HMAC digest [RFC2104] of all
      data from the version number up to and including the EOR byte.

Internet-Draft        Reputation Reporting Protocol            June 2010


      The password used to calculate the HMAC is a shared secret known
      by the sensor; the aggregator MUST look up the secret based on the
      user name in the report.  An aggregator MUST reject a report that
      fails to validate.  It SHOULD log information about invalid
      reports.

4.1.  Subreports

   A subreport consists of either the single byte 0, indicating the end
   of the subreports, or a three-byte preamble followed by the subreport
   contents.  The three-byte preamble consists of:

   o  One FORMAT byte.
   o  A two-byte LENGTH field.  This is a 16-bit unsigned integer in
      network byte order indicating the length of the subreport
      contents, not including the three-byte preamble.

4.2.  Subreport Formats

   The following subreport formats are defined.  The value of the FORMAT
   byte is given in decimal.

   o  0.  EOR.  (End of Reports) This signifies the end of the
      subreports in the report.  It MUST NOT be followed by a LENGTH
      field.
   o  1.  IPv4-EVENTS.  The LENGTH must be a multiple of 5.
   o  2.  IPv6-EVENTS.  The LENGTH must be a multiple of 17.
   o  3.  REPEATED-IPv4-EVENTS.  The LENGTH must be a multiple of 6.
   o  4.  REPEATED-IPv6-EVENTS.  The LENGTH must be a multiple of 18.
   o  5.  VENDOR-NUMBER.  The LENGTH MUST be 3.
   o  6.  SOFTWARE-NAME.  The LENGTH can range from 1 to 63.
   o  7.  SOFTWARE-VERSION.  The LENGTH can range from 1 to 31.
   o  8 through 126.  RESERVED.  A sensor MUST NOT create a subreport
      with a RESERVED FORMAT value.  An aggregator MUST ignore such a
      subreport.
   o  127.  COLLECTOR-LEVEL.  The LENGTH MUST be 2.  See the section
      "Hierarchical Aggregation".
   o  128 through 254.  VENDOR-SPECIFIC.  The report MUST contain a
      VENDOR-NUMBER subreport before any VENDOR-SPECIFIC subreport.
   o  255.  RESERVED.

   An aggregator MUST skip over subreports with format values it does
   not understand.  (It can do this by skipping ahead LENGTH bytes.)

   An aggregator MUST ignore the entire report if any subreports have
   invalid LENGTHs.  For example, it MUST reject a subreport of IPv4-
   EVENTS if the LENGTH is not a multiple of 5.  The aggregator SHOULD
   log information about invalid reports.

5.  Subreport Format Definitions

   The following sections define exactly how various subreports are
   formatted.

5.1.  IP Address Subreports

   FORMAT values 1 and 2 specify IPv4 and IPv6 subreports, respectively.
   Each IPv4 and IPv6 subreport contains one or more events.  The length
   of each IPv4 event is 5, and the length of each IPv6 event is 17.
   The events themselves consist of:

   o  The 4-byte IPv4 address or the 16-byte IPv6 address in network
      byte order.
   o  A one-byte EVENT TYPE.

5.1.1.  IP Address Event Types

   The following event types are defined for IPv4 and IPv6 events:

   o  0.  RESERVED: Event type 0 is reserved.  A sensor MUST NOT report
      events of type 0.
   o  1.  GREYLISTED: An SMTP client at the specified IP address was
      greylisted.  Greylisting is described in [GREY].
   o  2.  UNGREYLISTED: An SMTP client at the specified IP address was
      previously greylisted, but has now passed the greylisting test.
   o  3.  AUTO-SPAM: An SMTP client at the specified IP address sent a
      message that was considered to be spam by automatic filtering
      software.
   o  4.  HAND-SPAM: An SMTP client at the specified IP address sent a
      message that was considered to be spam by a human being.
   o  5.  AUTO-HAM: An SMTP client at the specified IP address sent a
      message that was considered to be non-spam by automatic filtering
      software.
   o  6.  HAND-HAM: An SMTP client at the specified IP address sent a
      message that was considered to be non-spam by a human being.
   o  7.  VALID-RECIPIENT: An SMTP client at the specified IP address
      issued an SMTP RCPT command that specified a valid recipient
      address.
   o  8.  INVALID-RECIPIENT: An SMTP client at the specified IP address
      issued an SMTP RCPT command that specified an invalid recipient
      address.
   o  9.  VIRUS: An SMTP client at the specified IP address transmitted
      a message considered to be a virus by virus-scanning software.
   o  10 - 255.  FUTURE: Event types ranging from 10 to 255 are reserved
      for future use.

5.2.  Repeated IP Address Subreports

   FORMAT values 3 and 4 specify REPEATED-IPv4 and REPEATED-IPv6
   subreports, respectively.  Each REPEATED-IPv4 and REPEATED-IPv6
   subreport contains one or more events.  The length of each REPEATED-
   IPv4 event is 6, and the length of each REPEATED-IPv6 event is 18.
   The events themselves consist of:

   o  The 4-byte IPv4 address or the 16-byte IPv6 address in network
      byte order.
   o  A one-byte EVENT TYPE.
   o  A one-byte REPEAT.  This byte is interpreted as an unsigned
      number.  It MUST be greater than or equal to two.  A REPEATED
      event MUST be interpreted exactly as if REPEAT non-repeated events
      were received.

   The EVENT TYPE field for a REPEATED-IPv4 or REPEATED-IPv6 event is
   exactly the same as for IPv4 or IPv6 events.  The extra REPEAT byte
   allows a sensor to compress up to 255 identical IP address events
   into a single REPEATED event.

5.3.  Vendor Number Subreport

   FORMAT value 5 specifies the VENDOR-NUMBER subreport.  This subreport
   MUST have a LENGTH of 3.  The 3-byte content of the subreport is a
   24-bit unsigned integer in network byte order specifying an IANA-
   assigned Private Enterprise Number [PEN].

5.4.  Software Name Subreport

   FORMAT value 6 specifies the SOFTWARE-NAME subreport.  The LENGTH can
   range from 1 to 63.  The contents MUST be a valid UTF-8 string
   specifying the name of the software running on the aggregator.  The
   string MUST NOT be zero-terminated.  An aggregator MAY include a
   SOFTWARE-NAME subreport in each report, but MUST NOT include more
   than one SOFTWARE-NAME subreport.

5.5.  Software Version Subreport

   FORMAT value 7 specifies the SOFTWARE-VERSION subreport.  The LENGTH
   can range from 1 to 31.  The contents MUST be a valid UTF-8 string
   (and SHOULD be a valid ASCII string) specifying the version of the
   software running on the aggregator.  The string MUST NOT be zero-
   terminated.

   An aggregator MAY include a SOFTWARE-VERSION subreport in each
   report, but MUST NOT include more than one SOFTWARE-VERSION
   subreport.  If an aggregator includes a SOFTWARE-VERSION subreport,

Internet-Draft        Reputation Reporting Protocol            June 2010


   it MUST also include a SOFTWARE-NAME subreport.

5.6.  Vendor-Specific Subreport

   FORMAT values 128 through 254 specify a VENDOR-SPECIFIC subreport.  A
   VENDOR-SPECIFIC subreport MUST be preceded by a VENDOR-NUMBER
   subreport.  A given report MAY contain more than one VENDOR-NUMBER
   subreport; the interpretation of a VENDOR-SPECIFIC subreport MUST be
   made according to the VENDOR-NUMBER subreport that most closely
   preceded the VENDOR-SPECIFIC subreport.

   The contents of the subreport are vendor-specific and not defined
   here.  An aggregator that does not understand a VENDOR-SPECIFIC
   subreport for a given VENDOR-NUMBER MUST ignore the subreport.


6.  Hierarchical Aggregation

   Normally, a sensor detects events directly (for example, it
   communicates with an MTA to detect events) and reports them to an
   aggregator, which builds the event database.  However, it may be
   desirable to have an aggregator take all of the events from its
   sensors and report them to a higher-level "upstream" aggregator.

   Allowing aggregators to report events to other aggregators introduces
   the possibility of reporting loops.  To break these loops,
   aggregators MUST include a COLLECTOR-LEVEL subreport.  It MUST be the
   first subreport in the report.

   A sensor that detects events directly SHOULD NOT include a COLLECTOR-
   LEVEL subreport.  However, if it does include one, it MUST specify a
   level of zero.

   An aggregator that will forward reports to another aggregator MUST be
   configured to have an "intrinsic level" greater than zero.  The
   aggregator MUST reject reports with a COLLECTOR-LEVEL greater than or
   equal to its intrinsic level.  When the aggregator forwards reports,
   it MUST include a COLLECTOR-LEVEL subreport containing its intrinsic
   level.  (If the original report included a COLLECTOR-LEVEL subreport,
   the aggregator MUST NOT include the original COLLECTOR-LEVEL report,
   but MUST replace it with its own COLLECTOR-LEVEL.)  Note that
   assignment and management of intrinsic levels is beyond the scope of
   this document; such assignment must be agreed upon by aggregator
   managers based on the hierarchy of sensors and aggregators.

6.1.  Collector Level Subreport

   FORMAT value 127 specifies the COLLECTOR-LEVEL subreport.  The LENGTH
   MUST be 2, and the contents are an unsigned 16-bit integer in network
   byte order specifying the intrinsic level of the agent sending the
   report.  If the COLLECTOR-LEVEL subreport is present, it MUST be the
   first subreport.  If it is missing, the aggregator MUST assume a
   COLLECTOR-LEVEL of zero.


7.  Report Restrictions

   A sensor MUST NOT report GREYLISTED or UNGREYLISTED events unless it
   implements greylisting.  A sensor MUST NOT report HAND-SPAM or HAND-
   HAM events unless it has a reliable system for accepting a human's
   decision about a message and can show beyond a reasonable doubt that
   a human in fact made the decision about the reported message.  A
   sensor MUST NOT report VALID-RECIPIENT or INVALID-RECIPIENT events
   unless it is capable of validating recipient addresses.

   A sensor MUST NOT report events for an IPv4 address that is not a
   globally-routable unicast address.  In particular, no IPv4 address in
   the Private Address Space of [RFC1918] should appear in a report, nor
   should any address in 127/8 nor 224/4.  An aggregator MUST ignore
   such addresses and SHOULD log the fact that they were received.

   A sensor MUST NOT report events for an IPv6 address that is not an
   Aggregatable Global Unicast Address as defined in [RFC4291].  An
   IPv4-compatible IPv6 address or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address MUST be
   reported as an IPv4 event and not an IPv6 event.  An aggregator MUST
   ignore events that violate this requirement and SHOULD log the fact
   that they were received.

   A sensor MUST NOT report a VIRUS event unless a virus was detected
   using a signature-based virus scanner.

   A sensor SHOULD include as many events in its report as necessary to
   make the report size at least 400 bytes.  A sensor MAY send out a
   shorter report, but MUST NOT do so unless failing to do so would
   result in loss of data.  (For example, if a sensor process is about
   to exit and has buffered events in memory, it SHOULD report the
   buffered events before exiting, even if the report size would be less
   than 400 bytes.)

   A sensor SHOULD NOT send a report that would exceed 492 bytes unless
   it has a priori knowledge that such a large UDP datagram will be
   received intact by the aggregator.  An aggregator MUST be prepared to
   handle a report as large as the largest possible UDP datagram (65507

   bytes of actual data.)

   A sensor MUST NOT send an empty report (that is, a report with no
   subreports.)

   When an aggregator logs information about a report, it MUST log the
   originating IP address of the report.  If the report is well-formed,
   it MUST log the user name associated with the report.  It SHOULD log
   additional information concerning the disposition of the report and
   the reason for the disposition.

   If Hierarchical Aggregation is being used, a sensor MUST NOT report
   events to more than one aggregator.  A lower-level aggregator MUST
   NOT forward events to more than one higher-level aggregator.  These
   restrictions are required to avoid the possibility of counting the
   same event more than once.


8.  Report Layout

   The following diagram illustrates the layout of a report.  The
   version byte starts immediately after the UDP header.

   Note that there are no alignment requirements or padding bytes.  The
   preceding figure shows some fields aligned to a four-byte boundary
   purely for ease of drawing.

8.1.  Sample Report

   The following figure shows a sample report.  The report is from the
   user "dfs" with password "foo".  It contains two IPv4 events:
   192.0.2.2 sent mail automatically classified as spam, and 192.0.2.3
   was greylisted.  There is a repeated IPv4 event: 192.0.2.4 sent to an
   invalid recipient 3 times.  Finally, There is one IPv6 event: 2001:
   470:1d:e4:2e0:18ff:feab:147f sent mail to a valid recipient.  The
   bytes are shown in hexadecimal.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a one-byte SUBREPORT FORMAT.  Formats 0 through
   7 and 127 are defined in Section 4.2 of this document.  The IANA
   should set up the "IP Reputation Reporting Format Numbers" registry
   for registering formats 8 through 126.  Formats 128 through 254 are
   available for private use without requiring IANA registration.
   Format 255 should not be used.

   This document defines a one-bye EVENT TYPE.  Event types 1 through 9
   are described in Section 5.1.1 of this document.  Event type 0 is
   reserved.  The IANA should set up the "IP Reputation Reporting Event
   Types" registry for registering event types 10 through 255.


10.  Security Considerations

   Because reports are transmitted via UDP, aggregators are vulnerable
   to spoofing.  An aggregator MAY use techniques other than HMAC
   verification to reject reports.  For example, if it knows that a
   particular user always sends reports from a restricted set of IP
   addresses, it MAY discard reports claiming to be from that user if
   they originate from outside the restricted set of addresses.  The
   aggregator SHOULD log information about discarded reports.

   Reports are transmitted in the clear.  An eavesdropper can easily
   sniff user names from the reports.  The eavesdropper can also gain
   information about SMTP traffic as seen by sensors.  If this is
   undesirable, the sensor SHOULD arrange to transmit data to the
   aggregator over a secure channel using IPSec or some other VPN

   solution.

   The shared secret SHOULD be at least 8 bytes long and SHOULD be
   generated by a cryptographically-secure random number generator.  The
   shared secret SHOULD NOT be chosen by a human being because of the
   risk of picking a weak secret or a secret guessable from the user
   name.

   An aggregator SHOULD use the time stamp and random-number fields to
   detect duplicate reports and fend off replay attacks.  An aggregator
   SHOULD NOT accept a report whose timestamp is more than two minutes
   away from the current time.  (For this reason, both aggregators and
   sensors SHOULD synchronize their clocks to a standard time source
   using NTP [RFC1305].)

   Aggregators implicitly trust sensors.  Therefore, aggregator
   administrators SHOULD ensure that sensor administrators follow
   security best-practices.  Both aggregator and sensor administrators
   MUST take the utmost care to keep their shared secret from leaking
   out.

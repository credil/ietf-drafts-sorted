Abstract

   A set of requirements and a proposed solution for the control of
   hierarchical Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is found in [HIER].
   However, support of multiple client layer networks are not covered
   by [HIER]. This internet draft describes additional requirements and
   proposes a solution to support multiple client layer networks.

1. Introduction and Problem Statement

   [HIER] defines a set of extensions for the control of hierarchical
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs).It allows an LSP created in one network,
   i.e. server network, to be used in another network, i.e. client
   network. The LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID is used during server network
   LSP establishment to exchange information about how to identify and
   optionally advertise the link in the client network.

2. Requirements

   In order to support flexible adaptation where a server network LSP
   provides services to multiple client networks, it is necessary to
   identify to which layer the information carried in the
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID applies to. For example, an OTN LSP is
   established and is available to carry Ethernet or SDH client
   traffic.

   New Requirement: For each client network supported, it should be
   possible to exchange both the layer identification and a separate
   set of control plane identifiers associated with the client layer.

3. Mechanisms and Protocol Extensions

   The extension continues to use the current format for
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object as defined in [HIER], and just adds a

   new sub-TLV that identifies the specific client layer(s) that should
   use the information exchanged in the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID. This
   allows a single LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID to carry information for
   multiple client layers if they share common control information.
   Several LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID objects are required when there are
   client layers with different control plane identifier information.

   A new CLIENT_LAYER_ID_SUB_TLV Object is defined to indicate to which
   client layer(s) the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID is applicable. The TLV
   is formatted as described in Section 3.1.2 of [HIER]. The Type field
   has the value 3 (TBD), and the Value field has the following
   content:

    0                   1                   2                   3

Abstract

   A set of requirements and a proposed implementation for the control
   of the SONET/SDH inverse multiplexing capabilities known as VCAT/LCAS
   is given in [CCAMP-VCAT]. However, implementations based on OIF
   implementation agreements and their prototype extensions have
   identified gaps in [CCAMP-VCAT]. This draft proposes a wider scoped
   alternative implementation approach that addresses the requirements
   of [CCAMP-VCAT] and additional requirements of independent setup of
   the VCAT group and its members.

1. Introduction

   The Optical Internetworking Forum (www.oiforum.com) has demonstrated
   signaling for inverse multiplexing in several of its worldwide
   interoperability events in 2005, 2007 and 2009. The OIF demos
   included signaling for Ethernet over VCAT control plane enabled
   connections. The demos included separate call and connection
   signaling for Ethernet, VCAT and STS-1/VC-4.

   This is the model described in [LIAISON-291].

   In order to perform the various interoperability events, some
   experimental extensions were tested and included the use of the NVC
   field of SONET/SDH SENDER_TSPEC in the VCAT layer signaling to
   indicate that the RSVP signaling exchanged pertained to VCAT. This
   approach, however, is not compatible with GMPLS implementations and
   could only be used in this experimental setting.

   IMG: Inverse Multiplexing Group

3. Use Cases and Requirements

   In a scenario where several signals are inverse multiplexed together
   to form an Inverse Multiplexing Group (IMG), it is possible that the
   IMG is established by the control plane but that the IMG members are
   not. Even in the case that the IMG members are control plane
   established, the members might be separately administered and
   policies may prevent signaling control information related to the IMG
   to be exchanged in the IMG member signaling. This results in a
   requirement to support independent signaling for the IMG and its
   members. This is a gap in [CCAMP-VCAT] because it piggybacks the VCAT
   call signaling CALL_ATTRIBUTES onto VCAT member signaling. If the IMG
   members are provisioned or if it is control plane enabled but does
   not allow piggybacking of IMG information onto its own signaling, it
   is not possible to use the procedure described in [CCAMP-VCAT].

   Business and/or regulatory requirements have caused the separation of
   "advanced telecommunications service" entities from traditional
   transport entities. The result of this has placed the management of
   data equipment, e.g. Ethernet switches, into a separate group from
   transport equipment. Given that the inverse multiplexing of a number
   of TDM connections together to satisfy requirements of the "advanced
   telecommunications service" organization is opaque to the transport
   organization, the configuration of the VCAT group cannot be
   piggybacked on the signaling for the TDM connections.

4. Signaling Extensions

   This section proposes a solution where signaling for an IMG and its
   members are performed independently, each requiring its own RSVP
   session and associated messaging.

   The IMG member signaling follows existing RSVP-TE based GMPLS
   signaling for the corresponding member signal.

   The IMG signaling is based on existing RSVP-TE based GMPLS signaling
   described in [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] with the following
   modifications:

   - A mechanism to identify that RSVP-TE signaling is reserving member
     resources for an IMG, described in this document.

   - A more generic mechanism to specify the requested bandwidth,
     described in this document.

Internet-Draft      draft-roch-ccamp-gmpls-inv-mux         October 2009


   - A mechanism that allows an RSVP_HOP to include several sub-TLVs
     for each direction, where each sub-TLV uniquely identifies one of
     the members of the IMG. A suitable solution could reuse the
     encoding from [MT_BDL].

   4.1. Extension for IMG signaling identification

   In order to identify that the signaling is related to an inverse
   multiplexing group, there has to be an indication in the signaling
   message. For example, a new Switching Type value could be defined for
   the RSVP-TE Generalized Label Request [RFC3473][RFC3471].

   A new switching type (TBD) for Inverse Multiplexing Capable is
   defined.

   Value       Type
   -----       ----
   TBD       Inverse-Multiplex Capable (IMC)


   4.2. Extension for IMG bandwidth

   In order to identify the bandwidth for an IMG, a description of the
   members and their numbers is necessary. A new IMG SENDER_TSPEC (Class
   12, C-TYPE TBD)/FLOWSPEC (Class 9, C-TYPE TBD) is defined

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |        Length (Variable)      | Class (12/9)  | C-Type (TBD)  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Signal Type                   |      Number of Members        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Signal Type can take the following values, based on [CCAMP-VCAT]:

         Value  Type (Elementary Signal)
         -----  ------------------------
           1     VT1.5  SPE / VC-11
           2     VT2    SPE / VC-12
           3     STS-1  SPE / VC-3
           4     STS-3c SPE / VC-4
          11     OPU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbit/s
          12     OPU2 (i.e., 10  Gbit/s)
          13     OPU3 (i.e., 40  Gbit/s)

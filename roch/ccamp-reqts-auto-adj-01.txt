Abstract

   A set of requirements and a proposed solution for the control of
   hierarchical Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is found in [HIER].
   However, support of multiple client layer networks and address
   separation as allowed by the Automatically Switched Optical Network
   (ASON) architecture [G.8080] are not covered by [HIER]. This
   internet draft describes additional requirements to consider for the
   use of LSP hierarchy in ASON networks.

1. Introduction and Problem Statement

   This problem statement applies to the operation of multilayer
   networks according to the ASON architecture.

   [HIER] defines a set of extensions for the control of hierarchical
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs).. This internet draft describes

   additional requirements for the use of LSP Hierarchy in ASON
   networks.

   1.1. Separate control plane instances at different layers

   In ASON architecture, the control plane instance in a client layer
   may be a separate instance than the control plane instance for the
   client layer. This requires that when a server layer link is
   created, sufficient information must be passed to allow a new
   control (signaling and optionally routing) association to be created
   between the client control instances at the ends of the new link.
   This includes identification and addressing information for both the
   signaling control instance and routing control instance at each end.

   This draft identifies the additional requirements for ASON multi-
   layer control in addition to those in [HIER].

   The ASON architecture [G.8080] allows for separate control plane
   instances for each controlled layer. In a real deployment, this can
   be seen in a few scenarios. For example, in networks mixing legacy
   equipment and emerging technologies, existing legacy control plane
   for some layers and new control plane for other layers may be based
   on different protocols, requiring different instances.

   Additionally, some equipment may be entirely under management plane
   control whereas other is under control plane. There might also be
   business boundaries due to mergers and acquisitions or due to
   internal company organization. In these cases, the result is
   multiple instances of control plane.

   Another scenario is that different instances may be used to solve
   scalability problems.

   1.2. Address and identifier separation within a layer

   Separate identification of routing controller instances, signaling
   controller instances and resource identifiers is required in order
   to support ASON signaling and routing.  Separation of routing
   controller and resource identifier is already addressed as a
   requirement in [RFC4652], as referenced by the terms "Li" and "Pi"
   for the logical control plane entity and physical node identifiers,
   respectively.  This allows 1:n relationships between the control
   entity and the physical resources being controlled, for example.

   Separation of routing and signaling controller identifiers and their
   respective reachable addresses allows the routing and signaling
   controller identifiers to be independent of the specific network

   address by which they are reached. This allows the operator to
   modify the signaling communications network addressing scheme
   without impacting the control plane protocols. Routing controller
   addressing is further discussed in [RFC4258].

2. Requirements

   2.1. Client Layer Identification

   In order to support flexible adaptation where a server layer
   provides services to multiple client layers, it is necessary to
   identify to which layer the information carried in the
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID applies to.

   New Requirement: For each client layer supported, it should be
   possible to exchange both the layer identification and a separate
   set of control plane identifiers associated with the client layer.

   2.2. Routing Controller Identification

   In ASON architecture, a routing controller possesses two
   identifiers. The first is the Routing Controller Protocol Controller
   Identifier (RC PC ID). The second is the IPv4 address at which the
   routing controller can be reached, the Routing Controller Signaling
   Control Network address (RC PC SCN address).

   New requirement: Since different client layers may have different
   routing controllers, it must be possible to exchange RC PC IDs and
   RC PC SCN addresses for each client layer that needs to advertise
   the link.

   2.3. Signaling Controller Identification

   In ASON architecture, signaling controller identifiers cannot be
   automatically derived from routing controller identifiers. In order
   to establish an RSVP-TE signaling adjacency between two client
   signaling controllers, a signaling mechanism is required in the
   server layer to identify the signaling controller. Each signaling
   controller requires two identifiers. The first is the Signaling
   Controller Protocol Controller Identifier (SC PC ID). The second is
   the IPv4 address at which the signaling controller can be reached.

   New Requirement: Since different client layers may have different
   signaling controllers, it must be possible to exchange SC PC IDs and
   SC PC SCN addresses for each client layer.

   2.4. Link Identification

   The following information is required for each link: area
   identifier, node identifier and interface identifier. Optionally, a
   bundle identifier may also be specified if a link is to be
   advertised as part of a bundle in the client layer.

   It should be noted that the node identifier is not the same as a
   routing controller or signaling controller identifier. It is the
   control plane identifier for the network element resources, i.e.,
   the Pi identified in [RFC4652].

   New requirement: Since different client layers may use different
   addressing spaces to name their resources, it must be possible to
   exchange separate link identification for each client layer.

   2.5. Requirements Summary

   The following table summarizes the information that is proposed to
   be exchanged on a per client layer basis as well as coverage in
   [HIER].

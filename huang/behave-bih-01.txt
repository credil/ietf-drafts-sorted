            Dual Stack Hosts Using "Bump-in-the-Host" (BIH)
                       draft-huang-behave-bih-01

Abstract

   This document describes the "Bump-In-the-Host" (BIH), a host based
   protocol translation mechanism that allows a subset of applications
   supporting only one IP address family to communicate with peers that
   are reachable or supporting only the other address family.

   This specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided dual
   stack or IPv6 only network connectivity.  In the dual stack network
   case, single address family applications in the host sometime will
   communicate directly with other hosts using the different address
   family.  In the case of IPv6 only network or IPv6 only destination,
   IPv4 originated communications have to be translated into IPv6.  The
   BIH makes the IPv4 applications think they talk to IPv4 peers and
   hence hides the IPv6 from those applications.

   Acknowledgement of previous work

   This document is an update to and directly derivative from Kazuaki
   TSHUCHIYA, Hidemitsu HIGUCHI, and Yoshifumi ATARASHI [RFC2767] and
   from Seungyun Lee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin Kim, Alain Durand, and
   Erik Nordmark's [RFC3338], which similarly provides a dual stack host
   means to communicate with other IPv6 host using existing IPv4
   appliations.  This document combines and updates both [RFC2767] and
   [RFC3338].

   The changes in this document reflect five components

      1.  Supporting IPv6 only network connections

      2.  IPv4 address pool use private address instead of the
      unassigned IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.1 - 0.0.0.255)

      3.  Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently

      4.  Adding an alternative way to implement the ENR

1.  Introduction

   While IPv6 support is being widely introduced throughout the
   Internet, a class of applications are going to remain IPv4-only.
   This document describes a Bump-in-the-Host (BIH), successor and
   combination of Bump-in-the-Stack (BIS) [RFC2767] and Bump-in-the-API
   (BIA) [RFC3338] technologies, which enables accommodation of
   significant set of the legacy IPv4-only applications in the IPv6-
   world.

   Bump-In-the-Host is not a general purpose translation solution.  The
   class of IPv4-only applications the described host-based NAT46
   protocol translation solution provides Internet connectivity over
   IPv6-only network access includes those applications that use DNS for
   IP address resolution and that do not embed IP address literals in
   protocol payloads.  This includes essentially all DNS using legacy
   client-server model applications, which are agnostic on IP address
   family used by the destination, but not other classes of
   applications.  The transition towards IPv6-only Internet is made
   easier by decreasing number of key applications that must be updated
   to IPv6.

   BIH technique includes two major implementation options: inserts a
   protocol translator between the IPv4 and the IPv6 stacks of a host or
   between the socket API module and the TCP/IP module.  Essentially,
   IPv4 is translated into IPv6 at the socket API level or at the IP
   level.

   When the BIH is implemented at the socket API layer, and IPv4
   applications communicate with IPv6 peers, the API translator
   intercepts the socket API functions from IPv4 applications and
   invokes the IPv6 socket API functions to communicate with the IPv6
   hosts, and vice versa.

   When the BIH is implemented at the networking layer, the IPv4 packets
   are intercepted and converted to IPv6 using the IP conversion
   mechanism defined in SIIT [RFC2765].  The translation has the same
   benefits and drawbacks as SIIT.

   In order to support communication between IPv4 applications and the
   target IPv6 hosts, pooled IPv4 addresses will be assigned through the
   extension name resolver.

   The BIH can be used whenever an IPv4-only application needs to
   communicate with an IPv6 peer, independently of the address families
   supported by the access network.  Hence the access network can be
   IPv6-only or dual-stack capable.

    Figure 2: Architecture of the dual-stack host using BIH at network
                                   layer

   Dual stack hosts defined in RFC2893 [RFC2893] need applications,
   TCP/IP modules and addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6.  The proposed
   hosts in this document have an API or network layer translator to
   communicate with other IPv6 hosts using existing IPv4 applications.
   The BIH translator consists of an entension name resolver, an address
   mapper, and depending on implementation either a function mapper or
   an protocol translator.

2.1.  Function Mapper

   Function mapper translates an IPv4 socket API function into an IPv6
   socket API function, and vice versa.

   When detecting the IPv4 socket API functions from IPv4 applications,
   it intercepts the function call and invokes new IPv6 socket API
   functions which correspond to the IPv4 socket API functions.  Those
   IPv6 API functions are used to communicate with the target IPv6
   hosts.  When detecting the IPv6 socket API functions from the data
   received from the IPv6 hosts, it works symmetrically in relation to
   the previous case.

Internet-Draft                     BIH                         July 2010


2.2.  Translator

   Translator translates IPv4 into IPv6 and vice versa using the IP
   conversion mechanism defined in SIIT [RFC2765].

   When receiving IPv4 packets from IPv4 applications, translator
   converts IPv4 packet headers into IPv6 packet headers, then, if
   required, fragments the IPv6 packets (because header length of IPv6
   is typically 20 bytes larger than that of IPv4), and sends them to
   IPv6 networks.  When receiving IPv6 packets from the IPv6 networks,
   translator works symmetrically to the previous case, except that
   there is no need to fragment the packets.

2.3.  Extension Name Resolver

   Extension Name Resolver returns a proper answer in response to the
   IPv4 or IPv6 application's request.

   In the case of socket API implementation option, when an IPv4
   application in an IPv6 only network tries to do forward lookup to
   resolve names via the resolver library (e.g. gethostbyname()), BIH
   intercept the function call and instead calls the IPv6 equivalent
   functions (e.g. getnameinfo()) that will resolve both A and AAAA
   records.

   If only AAAA record is available for the name queried, ENR requests
   the address mapper to assign an IPv4 address corresponding to the
   IPv6 address, creates an A record for the assigned IPv4 address, and
   returns the A record to the IPv4 application.

   If both A and AAAA record are available in the IPv6 only network, ENR
   does not require address mapper to assign IPv4 address, but instead
   asks address mapper to store relationship between the A and AAAA
   records, and then directly passes the received A record to the IPv4
   application.

        Application | Network  | ENR behaviour
        query       | response |
        ------------+----------+---------------------
           A        |   A      |  <return A record>
           A        |   AAAA   |  <synthesize A record>
           A        | A/AAAA   |  <return A record>

                   Figure 3: ENR behaviour illustration

   NOTE: An implementation option is to have ENR support in host's
   (stub) DNS resolver itself as described in [DNS64], in which case
   record synthesis is not needed and advanced functions such as DNSSEC

Internet-Draft                     BIH                         July 2010


   are possible.  If the ENR is implemented in network layer, same
   limitations arise as when DNS record synthesis is done on network.  A
   host also has option to implement recursive DNS server by itself.

2.3.1.  Reverse DNS lookup

   When an application initiates a reverse DNS query for a PTR record,
   to find a name for an IP address, the ENR MUST check whether the
   queried IP address can be found in the cache of the Address Mapper
   and is a local IP address.  If an entry is found and queried address
   is locally generated, the ENR must initiate corresponding reverse DNS
   query for the real IP address.

   For example, when application initiates reverse DNS query for a
   synthesized locally valid IPv4 address, the ENR needs to intercept
   that query query.  The ENR shall do reverse query for the
   destination's IPv6 address and return the name received as response
   to IPv6 reverse query to application that initiated the IPv4 query.

2.4.  Address Mapper

   Address mapper ("the mapper" later on ), maintains an IPv4 address
   pool in the case of dual stack network and IPv6 only network.  The
   pool consists of private IPv4 addresses as per [RFC1918].  Also,
   mapper maintains a table consisting of pairs of these locally
   selected IPv4 addresses and a destinations's IPv6 addresses.

   When the extension name resolver, translator, or the function mapper
   requests mapper to assign an IPv4 address corresponding to an IPv6
   address, mapper selects and returns an IPv4 address out of the pool,
   and registers a new entry into the table dynamically.  The
   registration occurs in the following 3 cases:

   (1) When the extension name resolver gets only an 'AAAA' record for
   the target host name in the dual stack or IPv6 only network and there
   is not a mapping entry for the IPv6 address.

   (2) When the extension name resolver gets both an 'A' record and an
   'AAAA' record for the target host name in the IPv6 only network and
   there is not a mapping entry for the IPv6 address.  But it doesn't
   need an IPv4 address out of the pool, just registers both IPv4 and
   IPv6 address from 'A' and 'AAAA' records into a new entry into the
   table.

   (3) When the function mapper gets a socket API function call from the
   data received and there is not a mapping entry for the IPv6 source
   address.

   When the resolver, translator, or the function mapper requests mapper
   to assign an IPv4 address corresponding to an IPv6 address, mapper,
   if required, selects and returns an IPv4 address out of the pool, and
   registers a new entry into the table dynamically.  The following
   table describes how mappings are created into the table in each
   possible scenario:

          Mapping table | Access    | Peer   | Created
          entry for     |link type  | support| address mapping
       -------------------+-------------+-------------------------------
       (1) real IPv4    |IPv4 or DS | v4     | < no mapping needed >
       (2) real IPv6    |IPv6 or DS | v6     | < no mapping needed >
       (3) real IPv4    |IPv6       | v4 & v6| real IPv4 -> real IPv6
       (4) real IPv6    |IPv4       | v4 & v6| real IPv6 -> real IPv4
       (5) local IPv4   |IPv6 or DS | v6     | local IPv4 -> real IPv6
       (6) local IPv6   |IPv4 or DS | v4     | local IPv6 -> real IPv4
       (7) real IPv4    |IPv6       | v4     | out of scope
       (8) real IPv6    |IPv4       | v6     | out of scope

           Figure 4: Address Mapper's mapping table illustration

   Below are examples for all eight scenarios:

   (1) When the resolver gets an 'A' reply for application's 'A' query
   on access network supporting IPv4, there is no need to create mapping
   (or just stub mapping real IPv4 -> real IPv4).

   (2) When the resolver gets an 'AAAA' reply for application's 'AAAA'
   query on access network supporting IPv6, there is no need to create
   mapping (or just stub mapping real IPv6 -> real IPv6).

   (3) When the resolver gets both 'A' and 'AAAA' replies for
   application's 'A' query on IPv6-only access, there shall be mapping
   for real IPv4 to real IPv6.

   (4) When the resolver gets both 'A' and 'AAAA' replies for
   application's 'AAAA' query on IPv4-only access, there shall be
   mapping for real IPv6 to real IPv4.

   (5) When the resolver gets only an 'AAAA' record for the target host
   name for application's 'A' request on IPv6 only or DS access network,
   a local IPv4 address will be given to application and mapping for
   local IPv4 address to real IPv6 address is created.

   (6) When the resolver gets only an 'A' record for the target host
   name for application's 'AAAA' request on IPv4 only or DS access
   network, a local IPv6 address will be given to application and

   (7) When the resolver gets only an 'A' record for the target host
   name for application's 'A' request on IPv6 only access network, a
   double translation would be required and thus is out of the scope of
   this document.

   (8) When the resolver gets only an 'AAAA' record for the target host
   name for application's 'AAAA' request on IPv4 only access network, a
   double translation would be required and thus is out of the scope of
   this document.

   NOTE: There is only one exception.  When initializing the table,
   mapper registers a pair of its own IPv4 address and IPv6 address into
   the table statically.

3.  Behavior and network Examples

   Figure 5 illustrates the very basic network scenario.  An IPv4-only
   application is running on a host attached to IPv6-only Internet and
   is talking to IPv6 enabled server.  A communication is made possible
   by bump in the host.

                       Figure 5: Network Scenario #1

   Figure 6 illustrates a possible network scenario where an IPv4-only
   application is running on a host attached to a dual-stack network,
   but the destination server is running on a private site that is
   numbered with public IPv6 addresses and private IPv4 addresses
   without port forwarding setup on NAT44.  The only means to contact to
   server is to use IPv6.

4.  Considerations

   Other considerations in [RFC3338] are still the same, here only
   clarify the section of IPv4 Address Pool and Mapping Table and
   Internally Assigned IPv4 or IPv6 Addresses to support private IPv4
   address.

4.1.  Socket API Conversion

   IPv4 socket API functions are translated into semantically the same
   IPv6 socket API functions and vice versa.  IP addresses embedded in
   application layer protocols (e.g., FTP) can be translated in API
   functions.  Its implementation depends on operating systems.

   NOTE: Basically, IPv4 socket API functions are not fully compatible
   with IPv6 since the IPv6 has new advanced features.

4.2.  ICMP Message Handling

   When an application needs ICMP messages values (e.g., Type, Code,
   etc.) sent from a network layer, ICMPv4 message values MAY be
   translated into ICMPv6 message values based on [SIIT], and vice
   versa.  It can be implemented using raw socket.

4.3.  IPv4 Address Pool and Mapping Table

   The address pool consists of the private IPv4 addresses as per
   [RFC1918].  This pool can be implemented at different granularity in
   the node e.g., a single pool per node, or at some finer granularity
   such as per user or per process.  However, if a number of IPv4
   applications communicate with IPv6 hosts or IPv6 applications
   communicate with IPv4 hosts, the available address spaces will be
   exhausted.  As a result, it will be impossible for IPv4 applications
   to communicate with IPv6 nodes.  It requires smart management
   techniques for address pool.  For example, it is desirable for the
   mapper to free the oldest entry and reuse the IPv4 address or IPv6
   address for creating a new entry.  This issues is the same as [BIS].
   In case of a per-node address mapping table, it MAY cause a larger
   risk of running out of address.

   The RFC1918 address space was chosen because generally legacy
   applications understand that as a private address space.  A new
   dedicated address space would run a risk of not being understood by
   applications as private.  The RFC1918 addresses have a risk of
   conflicting with other interfaces.  The conflicts can be mitigated by
   using least commonly used network number of the RFC1918 address space
   (TO BE SELECTED) and, if possible, cease using BIH on IPv6-interface
   after an IPv4-enabled interface is activated.

4.4.  Internally Assigned IPv4 Addresses

   The IPv4 addresses, which are internally assigned to IPv6 target
   hosts out of the pool, are the private IPv4 addresses.  IPv4
   addresses, which are internally assigned to IPv6 target hosts out of
   the spool, never flow out from the host, and so do not negatively
   affect other hosts.

   The internally assigned IPv4 address, which applications see as the
   source address, MUST be from different subnet than the IPv4 addresses
   used by the address synthesis function.  This approach ensures legacy
   applications realize they are not on the same link with their
   destination node and if needed, will trigger NAT traversal procedures

5.  Considerations due ALG requirements

   Support for IP-embedding applications, such as FTP and RTSP, requires
   implementation of Application Layer Gateway functions.  No ALG
   functionality is specified herein as ALG design is generally not
   encouraged for host based translation and as BIH is intented for
   applications not including IP addresses in protocol payload.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration of BIH mostly relies on that of [RFC2766].

   In the socket layer implementation approach the differences are due
   to the address translation occurring at the API and not in the
   network layer.  That is, since the mechanism uses the API translator
   at the socket API level, hosts can utilize the security of the
   network layer (e.g., IPsec) when they communicate with IPv6 hosts
   using IPv4 applications via the mechanism.  As well, there is no need
   for DNS ALG as in NAT-PT, so there is no interference with DNSSEC
   either.

   In the network layer implementation approach hosts can not utilize
   the security above network layer when they communicate with IPv6
   hosts using IPv4 applications via BIH and encrypt embedded IP
   addresses, or when the protocol data is encrypted using IP addresses
   as keys.  In these cases it is impossible for the mechanism to
   translate the IPv4 data into IPv6 and vice versa.  Therefore it is
   highly desirable to upgrade to the applications modified into IPv6
   for utilizing the security at communication with IPv6 hosts.

   The use of address pooling may open a denial of service attack
   vulnerability.  So BIH should employ the same sort of protection tec
   hniques as [NAT-PT] does.

Appendix A.  Implementation option for the ENR

   It is not necessary to implement the ENR at the kernel level, but it
   can be implemented instead at the user space by setting the default
   DNS server to point to 127.0.0.1.  DNS queries would then always be
   sent to the ENR, which furthermore ensures both A and AAAA queries
   are sent to the actual DNS server and A queries are always answered
   and required mappings created.

Appendix B.  API list intercepted by BIH

   The following functions are the API list which SHOULD be intercepted
   by BIH module when implemented at socket layer.

   The functions that the application uses to pass addresses into the
   system are:

      bind()

      connect()

      sendmsg()

      sendto()

   The functions that return an address from the system to an
   application are:

      accept()

      recvfrom()

      recvmsg()

      getpeername()

      getsockname()

   The functions that are related to socket options are:

      getsocketopt()

      setsocketopt()

   The functions that are used for conversion of IP addresses embedded
   in application layer protocol (e.g., FTP, DNS, etc.) are:

      recv()

      send()

      read()

      write()

   As well, raw sockets for IPv4 and IPv6 MAY be intercepted.

   Most of the socket functions require a pointer to the socket address
   structure as an argument.  Each IPv4 argument is mapped into
   corresponding an IPv6 argument, and vice versa.

   According to [RFC2553], the following new IPv6 basic APIs and
   structures are required.

         IPv4                     new IPv6
         ------------------------------------------------
         AF_INET                  AF_INET6
         sockaddr_in              sockaddr_in6
         gethostbyname()          getaddrinfo()
         gethostbyaddr()          getnameinfo()
         inet_ntoa()/inet_addr()  inet_pton()/inet_ntop()
         INADDR_ANY               in6addr_any

                                 Figure 9

   BIH MAY intercept inet_ntoa() and inet_addr() and use the address
   mapper for those.  Doing that enables BIH to support literal IP
   addresses.

   The gethostbyname() call return a list of addresses.  When the name
   resolver function invokes getaddrinfo() and getaddrinfo() returns
   multiple IP addresses, whether IPv4 or IPv6, they SHOULD all be
   represented in the addresses returned by gethostbyname().  Thus if
   getaddrinfo() returns multiple IPv6 addresses, this implies that
   multiple address mappings will be created; one for each IPv6 address.

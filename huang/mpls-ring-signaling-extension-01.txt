Abstract

   When using Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths
   (LSP) on a ring topology, it is needed to minimize the labels for
   protection purpose and minimize the configuration effort. Though MPLS
   Fast Re-Route [MPLS-FRR] can achieve automatic LSP service protection,
   it is not optimized as many labels are used to create lots of detour
   LSPs.

   This document describes a MPLS ring mechanism and some extensions on
   signaling protocol to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) using Label Distribution Protocol [LDP] or RSVP-TE
   protocol [RSVP-TE] to achieve automated link and node protection.

1. Introduction

   More and more network operators have considered using unified IP/MPLS
   technology in a single network infrastructure to provide multi-
   service, including fixed and mobile services. Since a large amount of
   access and aggregation network segments are fiber ring topology
   network, it is expected to use MPLS on a ring topology network. The
   industry is interested to find a lightweight planning, easy provision
   and little resource consumption solution for MPLS ring.

   MPLS Fast Re-Route [MPLS-FRR] can automatically create protection LSP
   and minimize the network provision work, but it is not optimized
   since it uses many labels and creates lots of detour  LSPs,
   especially in ring topology.

   This document describes a simple MPLS ring mechanism under which
   numerous service LSPs can be created automatically across the ring
   with some extensions on signaling protocol. The extensions on
   signaling solves label switch disruption because of node failure.
   Section 3 describes the ring protection scheme based on wrapping

   mechanism. Section 4 describes the signaling extensions for both LDP
   and RSVP-TE.

3. Ring Protection Scheme

   Several Internet Drafts on MPLS Ring said that both Steering mode and
   Wrapping mode can be used in a ring network. The scheme in this
   document only discusses wrapping mechanism. The idea is that steering
   method takes no advantage of ring topology and can just be achieved
   by known technology, such as MPLS TE FRR or PW redundancy. It is not
   indented to compare the two methods and to say which one is better
   than the other in this document and it should only be the operator's
   choices.

   In general, the scheme includes several technical points as following.

   1. For data transport layer on the ring, for each upstream
   /downstream direction, assigning CW as working path direction and
   CCW as protection path direction or vice versa. (The following
   examples in this document take CW as working direction on the
   ring). On working ring direction (CW), the packet outermost label is
   service LSP label. That is to say, no SPME label be added to service
   LSP packet at ring working direction.

   2. Pre-provision a closed protection LSP on ring protection
   direction. The ring protection LSP is to protect all service LSPs
   when a link or node failure occurs.

   3. Control layer, service LSPs crossing the ring can be created
   normally by LSP signaling with the extension in section 4. The
   extension is to send label switch information to downstream ring node
   or backup node.

   4. Normally, service LSP packet is forwarded along working direction,
   each ring node performs the normal MPLS forwarding at service LSP
   label level.

   5. When a link or node failure occurs, upstream node adjacent to the
   failure performs wrapping and pushes a protection ring label to
   the service LSP packet, and the packet is wrapped around in the
   protection ring direction and goes to downstream node adjacent to
   the failure.

   6. For a link failure, the downstream node adjacent to the failure
   is the immediate downstream node, it just pops the protection
   label and forwards the packet to the working direction.

   7. For a node failure, the downstream node adjacent to the failure
   is one hop away from the upstream node adjacent to the failure. After
   popping the protection label, the downstream node adjacent to the
   failure can do the label switching work in working direction with
   additional label switching information got from the failure node
   during the setup of the service LSP. The detailed procedure and the
   definition of the information is referred to section 4.

   8. To protect failure of ingress or egress node of a ring, a backup
   node can be assigned during MPLS ring provisioning. The signaling
   extensions defined in section 4 also provide the ability to notify
   the backup node the label switching information.

   Following sections provide some examples in details.

3.1. P-to-p LSP example

3.1.1. Link Failure example

   A LSP (LSP 1 in figure 1) crosses ring nodes A->B->C->D with
   labels:  . . . [L1]->[L2]->[L3]->[L4]->[L5]-> . . .

   A protection LSP is a closed LSP in CCW direction and is denoted as:
   [p1]->[p2]->[p3]->[p4]->[p5]->[p6]->[p1].

    Here we give some symbol illustration for the label stack
     1.  The label stack will be enclosed in square brackets ("[]")
     2.  Each level in the stack will be separated by the '|' character

     3.  The bottom of the stack will be denoted by the string "B" for
  two or more label layer.

   For example, the link between B and C goes down as shown in figure 2.
   After recovering, the packet forwarding path is denoted by '***' in
   the working direction and '###' in the protection direction.

   The forwarding path and encapsulation on link is: A-> [l2]-> B   -
   >[P6|L3|B] -> A -> [P1|L3|B] -> F -> [P2|L3|B] -> E -> [P3|L3|B] -> D
   -> [P4|L3|B] -> C -> [L4] -> D.

   When node B finds the link to C is failed, it push protection label
   [P5] to the out going packet with [L3] at egress port to C, so the
   label stack is [P5|L3|B], do wrapping and switch [P5|L3|B] to
   [P6|L3|B], then send out to link B-A.

   Node A,F,E,D just do Protection label switching and send the packet
   to C, and C receives the packet with [P4|L3|B].

   When node C finds the link to B has failed, at egress port to B, it
   pops protection label [P5] and extracts [L3], do wrapping and switch
   [L3] to [L4] based on normal label switching table entry, then send
   out [L4] to link C-D. Then at node D, the service LSP drops the ring
   after normal label switching.

3.1.2. Node Failure example

   For example, the Node B goes down as shown in figure 3.

   After recovering, the packet forwarding path is denoted by '***' in
   working direction and '###' in protection direction.

   The forwarding path and the encapsulation on link is:  A -> [P1|L2|B]
   -> F -> [P2|L2|B] -> E -> [P3|L2|B] -> D -> [P4|L2|B] -> C -> [L4] ->
   D.

   When node A finds the link to B is failed, it push protection label
   [P6] to the outgoing packet with [L2] at egress port to B, thus the
   label stack is [P6|L2|B], do wrapping and switch [P6|L2|B] to
   [P1|L2|B], then send out to link A-F.

   Node F,E,D just do Protection label switching and send the packet to
   C, and C receives the packet with [P4|L2|B].

                 Figure 3: packet flow when node B failure

   When node C finds the link to B is failed, it pops the protection
   label [P5] and gets [L2] at egress port to B, does wrapping and
   switches [L2] to [L4] supported by label switching information
   notified by node B during setup of the LSP. This notification
   operation uses the signaling extensions defined in section 4. Node C
   then sends out packet with [L4] to link C-D. At node D, the service
   LSP drops the ring after normal label switching.

3.3. OAM Consideration

   Each pair of adjacent nodes on the ring should deploy OAM continuity
   check (CC) mechanism to detecting failures between each other. When
   one node gets event(s) that the CC check to one peer node fails, it
   will inform from the opposite direction to inform the event for the
   ring. That is to say, using section OAM can do the job.

Internet-Draft  Signaling Extension for MPLS Ring Protection      October 2010


   Section OAM also can meet the need for multiple logical ring
   instances be deployed in one physical link. The possible scenario in
   industry regarding this is two tangent rings which share one or more
   links between two ring nodes (the ring nodes can be adjacent or not).
   Theoretically one may worry about the case that when do wrapping, how
   to recognize different logical ring and push related protection label
   on the packets. In reality, as long as we design the two ring under
   the same policy, that is, taking CW (or vice versa) as working
   direction on both rings (this is the most popular case), there is no
   problem in question on the shared link(s).

   How to perform the OAM CC and how to inform the failure event to the
   right receiver, is out of scope of this document. We think that both
   MPLS and MPLS-TP OAM mechanism can be used for the purpose.

4. Signaling extension

   The purpose of the signaling extension is to backup the protected
   node's label switching information to one backup node. Under ring
   topology the backup type has two case:

   Case 1: For protecting transit ring node, the backup node is the
   immediate downstream node to the protected one.

   Case 2: For protecting ingress/egress ring node, backup node is
   provisioned by operator.

   Case 1 can be illustrated in the same example shown in figure 3, the
   normal forwarding path and labels on links are: A -> [L2] -> B -> [L3]
   -> C -> [L4] -> D. During the LSP setup, when node B gets the mapping
   label from C [L3], it allocate [L2] to node A and locally generate
   label switching information <L2-to-L3> for forwarding.  At this point
   of time, Node C send a new message to Node C containing the local
   switching information <L2-to-L3>.

   When node C gets the message containing the label mapping information
   <L2-to-L3>, combines it's local label switching information <L3-to-
   L4>, and generates a new label mapping info as <L2-to-L4>. The new
   label switching information can help node C to finish the work
   described in section 3.1.2.

   Every protected node should perform the signaling procedure like node
   B in above example.

   Note that above mechanism needs to do some label planning work to
   avoid duplicate label for adjacent links (e.g.  link C-D and link B-C
   are adjacent links).

   Case 2 can be illustrated in figure 4.

                 Figure 4 Packet flow when node D failure

   Definition for illustration:

   Port E-T : Means physical port at node E which connects node T.

   Backup id: An id number to correlate two ports.

   To protect node D which is the egress node of some service LSPs (e.g.
   LSP 1 in figure 4), a backup node E should be selected and configured.
   The port E-T and port D-T are configured one same backup id for
   example 1000.

   When node D gets the allocated label [L5] from downstream node T
   which is not the ring node, it allocate label [L4] to node C. At the
   mean time, node D send a new message containing label mapping
   information <L4-to-L5> and backup id 1000 to pre-configured backup
   node E.

   At node E, after getting the message, E generate a new local label
   switching information <L4-to-L5> take in-port as ring port E-D and
   out-port as the port E-T according to backup id.

   In figure 4, When E gets packets from the protection ring direction
   with encapsulation [P2|L4|B], it pop the protection label and switch
   [L4] to [l5] and send out the packet to node T. Node T can handle the
   packet from port T-E just like it comes from port T-D.

4.1. LDP extension

   A TLV bearing the label mapping information described above can meet
   both case 1 and case 2. The TLV can be named as Label Mapping
   Information TLV.

   For LDP protocol, it use Notification message ([LDP] Section 3.5.1 )
   to contain the new TLV. The TLV is optional.

   If a LSR is configured to perform ring protection as section 3, after
   it gets one label (egress label) from it's downstream peer and
   allocate a new label (ingress label) to the peer LSR which stands at
   upstream, it SHOULD send a Notification message containing the Label
   Mapping Information TLV to the downstream LSR under the Case 1 or to
   the backup LSR under the Case 2. The LSR can discriminate the
   different cases by the fact that whether the egress port for the
   label is the port which belongs to the ring.

   If a LSR gets the Notification message which contains the Label-
   Mapping-Info TLV, it SHOULD generate a new local label switching
   information for forwarding. The LSR can recognize the cases by the
   TLV content.

   The Label-Mapping-Info TLV will be put in the optional parameter
   field following the status TLV and be described as following:

   Optional Parameter     Type     Length  Value

   Label-Mapping-Info     TBD        20    See below

   Label Mapping Information TLV 's format is shown in figure 5.

   Following gives some explanation of Label Mapping Info TLV.

   IMT  Ingress Mapping Type

     0: Denote that the value in field Ingress Ring id/Backup id is the
     ring id to which the LSP belongs at the ingress port.

     1: Denote that the value in field Ingress Ring id/Backup id is the
     backup id which the ingress port correlates.

     Other: Reserved.

   EMT  Egress Mapping Type

     0: Denote that the value in field Egress Ring id/Backup id is the
     ring id to which the LSP belongs at the egress port.

     1: Denote that the value in field Egress Ring id/Backup id is the
     backup id which the egress port correlates.

     Other: Reserved.

   Ingress ring/backup id:  The value of ingress ring id or backup id of
       the ingress port.

   Ingress Label: The value of ingress label.

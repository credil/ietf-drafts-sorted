Abstract 

   When using Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths 
   (LSP) on a ring topology, it is needed to minimize the labels for  
   protection purpose and minimize the configuration effort. Though MPLS 
   Fast Re-Route [MPLS-FRR] can achieve automatic LSP service protection, 
   it is not optimized as many labels are used to create lots of detour 
   LSPs.  

   This document describes a MPLS ring mechanism and some extensions on 
   signaling protocol to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched 
   Paths (LSPs) using Label Distribution Protocol [LDP] or RSVP-TE 
   protocol [RSVP-TE] to achieve automated link and node protection.

1. Introduction 

   More and more network operators have considered using unified IP/MPLS 
   technology in a single network infrastructure to provide multi- 
   service, including fixed and mobile services. Since a large amount of 
   access and aggregation network segments are fiber ring topology 
   network, it is expected to use MPLS on a ring topology network. The  
   industry is interested to find a lightweight planning, easy provision 
   and little resource consumption for a MPLS ring solution.   

   MPLS Fast Re-Route [MPLS-FRR] is a good technology to automatically 
   create protection LSP and minimize the network provision work, but it 
   is not optimized since it uses many labels and creates lots of detour  
   LSPs, especially in ring topology.  

   This document describes a simple MPLS ring mechanism under which 
   numerous LSP service can be created automatically across the ring 
   with some extensions on signaling protocol. The extensions on 
   signaling solves label switch disruption because of node failure. 
   Section 3 describes the ring protection scheme based on wrapping

   mechanism. Section 4 describes the signaling extensions for both LDP 
   and RSVP-TE.

3. Ring Protection Scheme 

   Several Internet Drafts on MPLS Ring said that both Steering mode and  
   Wrapping mode can be used in a ring network. The scheme in this 
   document only discusses wrapping mechanism. The idea is that steering 
   method takes no advantage of ring topology and can just be achieved 
   by known technology, such as MPLS TE FRR or PW redundancy. It is not 
   indented to compare the two methods and to say which one is better 
   than the other in this document and it should only be up to the 
   operator's choices. 

   In general, the scheme includes several technical points as following.  
   1. For data transport layer on the ring, for each upstream   
   /downstream direction, assigning CW as working path direction and    
   CCW as protection path direction or vice versa. (The following    
   examples in this document take CW as working direction on the     
   ring). On working ring direction (CW), the transport outermostlabel 
   is service LSP label. That is to say, no PSME label be added to 
   service LSP packet at ring working direction.  

   2. Pre-provision a closed protection LSP on ring protection    
   direction. The ring protection LSP is to protect all service LSPs    
   when a link or node failure occurs.  

   3. Control layer, service LSPs crossing the ring can be created    
   normally by LSP signaling with the extension provided in section     
   4. The extension is to send label switch information to downstream 
   ring node or backup node.

   4. Normally, service LSP packet is forwarded along working direction,    
   each ring node performs the normal MPLS forwarding at service LSP     
   label level.   

   5. When a link or node failure occurs, upstream node adjacent to the     
   failure performs wrapping and pushes a protection ring label to    
   the service LSP packet, and the packet is wrapped around in the    
   protection ring direction and goes to downstream node adjacent to    
   the failure.  

   6. For a link failure, the downstream node adjacent to the failure    
   is its immediate downstream node, it just pops the protection    
   label and forwards the packet to the working direction. 

   7. For a node failure, the downstream node adjacent to the failure    
   is one hop away from the upstream node adjacent to the failure    
   performs the wrapping operation. Then the downstream node adjacent to 
   the failure can do the label switching work by receiving the label 
   switching information from the failure node during the setup of the 
   service LSP. How to notify the LSP information will be defined in 
   section 4.  

   8. To protect failure of ingress or egress node of a ring, a backup    
   node can be assigned during provisioning. The signaling extensions 
   defined in section 4 also provide the ability to notify the backup 
   node the label switching information. 

   Following sections provide some examples in details. 

3.1. P-to-p LSP example 

3.1.1. Link Failure example 

   A LSP (LSP 1 in figure 1) crosses ring nodes A->B->C->D with 
   labels:  . . . [L1]->[L2]->[L3]->[L4]->[L5]-> . . .  

   A protection LSP is denoted as: [p1]->[p2]->[p3]->[p4]->[p5]->[p6]-
   >[p1]. 

   Here we give some symbol illustration for the label stack 
    1.  The label stack will be enclosed in square brackets ("[]") 
    2.  Each level in the stack will be separated by the '|' character 
    3.  The bottom of the stack will be denoted by the string "B" for 
 two or more label layer.

   The forwarding path is: A-> [l2]-> B   ->[P6|L3|B] -> A -> [P1|L3|B] 
   -> F -> [P2|L3|B] -> E -> [P3|L3|B] -> D -> [P4|L3|B] -> C -> [L4] -> 
   D.   

   When node B finds the link to C is failed, it push protection label 
   [P5] to the out going packet with [L3] at egress port to C, thus the 
   label stack is [P5|L3|B], do wrapping and switch [P5|L3|B] to 
   [P6|L3|B], then send out to link B-A.   

   Node A,F,E,D just do Protection label switching and send the packet 
   to C, and C receives the packet with [P4|L3|B]. 

   When node C finds the link to B has failed, at egress port to B, it 
   pops protection label [P5] and extracts [L3], do wrapping and switch 
   [L3] to [L4] based on normal label switching table entry, then send 
   out [L4] to link C-D. 

3.1.2. Node Failure example 

   For example, the Node B goes down as shown in figure 3.  
    
   The packet forwarding path is denoted by '***' in working direction 
   and '###' in protection direction.  
    
   The forwarding path is:  A -> [P1|L2|B] -> F -> [P2|L2|B] -> E -> 
   [P3|L2|B] -> D -> [P4|L2|B] -> C -> [L4] -> D. 
    
   When node A finds the link to B is failed, it push protection label 
   [P6] to the outgoing packet with [L2] at egress port to B, thus the 
   label stack is [P6|L2|B], do wrapping and switch [P6|L2|B] to 
   [P1|L2|B], then send out to link A-F. 
    
   Node F,E,D just do Protection label switching and send the packet to 
   C, and C receives the packet with [P4|L2|B].

   label [P5] and gets [L2] at egress port to B, does wrapping and 
   switches [L2] to [L4] based on label switching information notified

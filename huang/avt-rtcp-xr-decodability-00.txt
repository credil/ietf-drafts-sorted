Internet-Draft      RTCP XR Decodability Report Blocks      October 2010


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in Transport Stream.  The new block type supports
   the reporting of consistency of Transport Stream [ETSI].  This new
   block type can be useful for identifying the existence, and
   characterising the severity, of a packet transport problem which may
   affect users' perception of a service delivered over RTP, also useful
   for Verifying the continued correct operation of an existing system
   management and providing accurate measures of Transport Stream
   quality for operators.

   The metric is applicable to any other types of RTP application that
   use TS standard format for transmission and storage of audio, video,
   and data.


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

2.2.  Acronyms

   SSRC
      Synchronization Source [RFC3550]

   TS
      Transport Stream [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007]


3.  TR 101 290 Decodability Statistics Metric Report Block

   This block reports decodability statistics metric beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  Information
   is recorded about the number of Transport Stream Synchronization
   Losses, Sync byte errors, Continuity count errors, Transport errors,
   Program Clock Reference (PCR) errors, PCR repetition errors, PCR
   discontinuity indicator errors, and Presentation Time Stamp (PTS)
   errors [ETSI].  Such information can be useful for network management
   and video quality monitoring.

   Note that this is not only applicable to MPEG-2 RTP streams

   [RFC2250],but also applicable to any other video codec using
   Transport Stream as input.

   The report block contents are dependent upon a series of flag bits
   carried in the first part of the header.  Not all parameters need to
   be reported in each block.  Flags indicate which are and which are
   not reported.  The fields corresponding to unreported parameters MUST
   be present, but are set to zero.  The receiver MUST ignore any
   Decodability Metrics Block with a non-zero value in any field flagged
   as unreported.

   The Decodability Metrics Block has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

4.  SDP Signaling

   One new parameters are defined for the one report blocks defined in
   this document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].
   They have the following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute
   [RFC3611]:

                     / "Transport error"
                     / "PCR related error"
                     / "PTS error"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


5.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns one new block type values in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:

      Name:       TDM
      Long Name:  TR 101 290 Decodability Metrics
      Value       <TDM>
      Reference:  section 3

   This document also registers one SDP [RFC4566] parameters for the
   "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:

      *  "decodability-metrics"

   The contact information for the registrations is:

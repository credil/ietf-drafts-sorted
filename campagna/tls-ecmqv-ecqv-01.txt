      ECMQV_ECQV Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                    draft-campagna-tls-ecmqv-ecqv-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocols that use
   Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) certificates to authenticate an
   Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) exchange.  These cipher
   suites provide forward secrecy.

1.  Introduction

   Elliptic curve implicit certificates, combined with the Elliptic
   Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) key agreement schemes, provide
   significant computation and bandwidth savings over traditional
   certificate schemes and the Diffie-Hellman key agreement schemes,
   while still affording equivalent security properties.

   Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) is an implicit certificate scheme
   that removes the need for explicitly signing a public key and
   associated data in the certificate.  Details of the security
   properties provided by ECQV can be found in [SEC4].  Compared to
   currently prevalent certificate schemes, ECQV provides smaller
   certificate sizes for equivalent security levels.  This is
   illustrated in the following table, which compares the minimial
   number of bit required to convey the public key and, if required, the
   explicit signature in the certificate, at various symmetric key
   security levels.  In the table columns with (p/2^m) shows sizes for
   elliptic curve groups over prime fields of size p or 2^m,
   respectively.

         +-----------+--------------+---------------+------------+

   [RFC4492] defines a set of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based
   cipher suites for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and
   describes the use of ECC certificates for client authentication.  In
   particular, it specifies the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDH) key agreement in a TLS handshake and the use of Elliptic Curve
   Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for authentication.

   ECMQV key agreement with ECQV implicit certifcates, denoted
   ECMQV_ECQV, provides the same security properties as provided by
   ephemeral ECDH (ECDHE) with ECDSA certificates, but requires less
   computation.  The following table compares the number of operations
   required by each party in the two schemes.

   +--------------------------------+----------------------------------+

   The computational and bandwidth savings make ECMQV_ECQV particularly
   attractive for bandwidth-constrained environments and devices with
   constrained computational power.

   ECMQV and ECQV are used in the Certificate Based Key Exchange (CBKE)
   defined in the ZigBee Smart Energy Specification [ZigBeeSE].  ZigBee
   is developing an Internet Protocol (IP) capability to support a
   unified Smart Energy profile to run over HomePlug.  This document is
   meant to help support the general ZigBee and HomePlug efforts to use
   IETF protocols and achieve application-layer security, bandwidth, and
   computational goals.

   This document describes additions to TLS and DTLS to support
   ECMQV_ECQV, applicable to TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246], TLS version 1.1
   [RFC4346], and TLS version 1.2 [RFC5246], as well as DTLS version 1.0
   [RFC4347] and DTLS version 1.2 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4347-bis].  In
   particular, it defines:

   o  the use of the Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) key
      agreement scheme with long-term and ephemeral keys to establish
      the premaster secret, and

   o  the use of Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certificates
      for authentication of peers.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Section 3
   provides an overview of ECMQV_ECQV-based key exchange algorithms for
   TLS.  Section 4 describes the data structures and actions required to
   implement the new authenticated key agreement scheme.  Section 5
   defines new ECMQV_ECQV-based cipher suites and identifies a small
   subset of these as recommended for all implementations of this
   specification.  Section 7 discusses security considerations.
   Section 8 describes IANA considerations for the name spaces created
   by this document.

3.  ECMQV_ECQV Key Exchange Algorithm

   This document describes a new ECC-based key exchange algorithm for
   TLS and DTLS.  It uses ECMQV to compute the premaster secret.  The
   derivation of the master secret from the premaster secret and the
   subsequent generation of bulk encryption/MAC keys and initialization
   vectors is independent of the key exchange algorithm and not impacted
   by the techniques in this document.

   ECMQV_ECQV key exchange provides forward secrecy and mutual
   authentication.  It provides a new server authentication mechanism
   and a new client authentication mechanism, both using ECQV
   certificates.  This document treats the ECQV certificates as an
   opaque data structure that is defined outside this specification; for
   example, this structure could be an X.509 format.

3.1.  ECMQV_ECQV Handshake Protocol Overview

   The handshake defined for ECMQV_ECQV requires that a server has an
   ECQV certificate.  In the case that the client also has a certificate
   no CertificateVerify message is required: proof of possession of the
   private key is demonstrated by the verify_data in the Finished
   method.  This is a property afforded by ECMQV that also applies to
   ECQV certificates and can reduce the bandwidth and computational
   complexity of a mutually authenticated key establishment.

3.2.  Server Authentication

   The ECMQV_ECQV scheme provides server authentication by the exchange
   of an ECQV certificate issued by a certificate authority recognized
   by the client.

3.3.  Client Authentication

   The ECMQV_ECQV scheme provides client authentication by the exchange
   of an ECQV certificate issued by a certificate authority recognized
   by the clientserver.

   The server MUST request ECQV-based client authentication by including
   this certificate type in its CertificateRequest message.  The client
   MUST check if it possesses a certificate appropriate for this method
   suggested by the server and is willing to use it for authentication.

   If these conditions are not met, the client SHOULD send a client
   Certificate message containing no certificates.  In this case, the
   ClientKeyExchange message is as described in .  If the server
   requires client authentication, it MAY respond with a fatal handshake
   failure alert.

   If the client has an appropriate certificate and is willing to use it
   for authentication, it MUST send that certificate in the client's
   Certificate message (as per Section 4.4) and prove possession of the
   private key corresponding to the certified key.  The process of
   proving possession is described below.

   The cipher suites described in this document make use of the elliptic
   curve parameter negotiation mechanism defined in [RFC4492], which
   makes use of TLS extensions [RFC4366].  When the cipher suites
   defined in this document are used, the 'ecmqv_ecqv' case inside the
   ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange structure MUST be used (i.e.,
   the ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange messages MUST include the
   ECQV parameters).

4.  Data Structures and Computations

   This section specifies the data structures and computations used by
   ECMQV key mechanisms specified in Section 5.  The presentation
   language used here is the same as that used in TLS [RFC4346].  Since
   this specification extends TLS, these descriptions should be merged
   with those in the TLS specification and any others that extend TLS.
   This means that enum types may not specify all possible values, and
   structures with multiple formats chosen with a select() clause may
   not indicate all possible cases.

   The ClientHello message and the ServerHello messages are unchanged
   and utilize those used in [RFC4492].

4.1.  Server Certificate

   When this message is sent:

   This message is sent in all ECMQV_ECQV-based cipher suites.

   Meaning of this message:

   This message is used to authentically convey the server's static
   public key to the client.  ECC public keys MUST be encoded in a
   Certificate message.

   Structure of this message:

       opaque ECQVCert<1..2^8-1>

       struct {
           ECQVCert certificate_list<0..2^16-1>
       } Certificate;

   The ECQVCert value is defined by the underlying application
   specification.  For general details on the necessary components see
   SEC 4 [SEC4].

   The server constructs an appropriate Certificate structure and
   conveys it to the client in the Certificate message.  If the client
   has used a Supported Elliptic Curves Extension, the public key in the
   server's certificate MUST respect the client's choice of elliptic
   curves; in particular, the public key MUST employ a named curve (not
   the same curve as an explicit curve) unless the client has indicated
   support for explicit curves of the appropriate type.  If the client
   has used a Supported Point Formats Extension, both the server's
   public key point and (in the case of an explicit curve) the curve's
   base point MUST respect the client's choice of point formats.  (A

   server that cannot satisfy these requirements MUST NOT choose an
   ECMQV_ECQV cipher suite in its ServerHello message.)

   Actions of the receiver:

   The client validates the information in the ECQVCert and extracts the
   server's public key using the operations specified in SEC 4 [SEC4]
   section 2.3, under the curve specified in the Server Key Exchange
   message defined in Section 4.2.  (A possible reason for a fatal
   handshake failure is that the client's capabilities for handling
   elliptic curves and point formats are exceeded; cf. [RFC4492],
   Section 5.1.)

4.2.  Server Key Exchange

   When this message is sent:

   This message is sent in all ECMQV_ECQV-based cipher suites.

   Meaning of this message:

   This message is used to convey the server's ephemeral ECMQV public
   key (and the corresponding elliptic curve domain parameters) to the
   client.

   Structure of this message:

       struct {
           ECParameters curve_params;
           ECPoint      public;
       } ServerECMQVParams;

   curve_params: Specifies the elliptic curve domain parameters
   associated with the ECMQV public key and is as specified in
   [RFC4492], Section 5.4.

   public: The ephemeral ECMQV public key.

   The ServerKeyExchange message is extended as follows.

       enum {
           ec_mqv (xx)
       } KeyExchangeAlgorithm;

   ec_mqv: Indicates the ServerKeyExchange message contains an ECMQV
   public key.

   The ServerKeyExchange structure is extended as follows:

Internet-Draft              ECMQV_ECQV in TLS               January 2010


       select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
           case ec_mqv:
               ServerECMQVParams params;
       } ServerKeyExchange;

   params: Specifies the ECMQV public key and associated domain
   parameters.

   Actions of the sender:

   The server selects elliptic curve domain parameters and an ephemeral
   ECMQV public key corresponding to these parameters according to the
   ECKAS-MQV scheme as specified in [SEC1], Section 6.2.  It conveys
   this information to the client in the ServerKeyExchange message using
   the format defined above.

   NOTE: curve_params MUST specify the same curve that is used by the
   CA, and the curve on which the point in the Certificate from the
   server's Certificate message lies.

   Actions of the receiver:

   The client retrieves the server's elliptic curve domain parameters
   and ephemeral ECMQV public key from the ServerKeyExchange message and
   MUST validate the parameters in accordance with [SEC1], Section
   6.2.1, and MUST validate the ephemeral public keys in accordance with
   [SEC1], Section 6.2.2.  (A possible reason for a fatal handshake
   failure is that the client's capabilities for handling elliptic

4.3.  Certificate Request

   When this message is sent:

   This message is sent by the server when requesting client
   authentication.

   Meaning of this message:

   The server uses this message to suggest acceptable client
   authentication methods.

   Structure of this message:

   The CertificateRequest message is extended as follows.

       enum {
           ecqv_ecmqv (xx),

       } ClientCertificateType;

   ecqv_ecmqv: Indicates that the server would like to use the
   corresponding client authentication method specified in Section 4.4.

   The SignatureAndHashAlgorithms are extended by the addition of a
   hashing algorithm which uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   functions AES-128 and AES-256 in Matyas-Meyer-Oseas (MMO) hash
   function mode ([ZigBee], Section B.6; see also [MOV96], Section
   9.4.1) and an implicit certificate type signature for ECQV.

       enum {
           aes_128_mmo (xx), aes_256_mmo (xx)
       } HashAlgorithm;

       enum {
           ecqv (xx)
       } SignatureAlgorithm;

       struct {
           ClientCertificateType certificate_types<1..2^8-1>;
           SignatureAndHashAlgorithm
               supported_signature_algorithms<1..2^16-1>;
           DistinguishedName certificate_authorities<0..2^16-1>;
       } CertificateRequest;

   The benefit of ECQV certificate exchanges is the reduction in packet
   sizes.  It is expected that most of the parties communicating via
   ECQV certificates belong to the same or a small list of acceptable
   certificate authorities, and that these certificate authorities are
   identified within the certificates.  As such, it is expected that the
   certificate_authorities list will often be empty.

   The interaction of the certificate_types and
   supported_signature_algorithms fields is further complicated when
   using TLS version 1.2 [RFC5246].  The following rules augment the
   existing rules in [RFC5246]:

   o  If the ecqv SignatureAlgorithm type is specified, it only applies
      to the public key contained in the end-entity certificate.  It
      cannot be used to sign certificates.

   Actions of the sender:

   The server decides which client authentication methods it would like
   to use, and conveys this information to the client using the format
   defined above.

Internet-Draft              ECMQV_ECQV in TLS               January 2010


   Actions of the receiver:

   The client determines whether it has a suitable certificate for use
   with any of the requested methods and whether to proceed with client
   authentication.

4.4.  Client Certificate

   When this message is sent:

   This message is sent by the client in response to a
   CertificateRequest when a client has a suitable certificate and has
   decided to proceed with client authentication.  (Note that if the
   server has used a Supported Point Formats Extension, a certificate
   can only be considered suitable for use with the ECQV_ECMQV
   authentication methods if the public key point specified in it
   respects the server's choice of point formats.  If no Supported Point
   Formats Extension has been used, a certificate can only be considered
   suitable for use with these authentication methods if the point is
   represented in uncompressed point format.)

   Meaning of this message:

   This message is used to authentically convey the client's static
   public key to the server in an ECQV certificate.

   Structure of this message:

   Identical to the ECQV Certificate format specified in Server
   Certificate Section 4.1.

   Actions of the sender:

   The client constructs an appropriate Certificate message.

   NOTE: The ECQV certificate MUST be issued by a CA on the same curve
   specified in the ECParameters sent in the Server Key Exchange
   message.  The point in the ECQV certificate MUST also be on the same
   curve.

   Actions of the receiver:

   The server validates the information in the ECQVCert, and extracts
   the client's public key using the operations specified in [SEC4]
   section 2.3, under the curve specified in the Server Key Exchange
   message defined in Section 4.2.

4.5.  Client Key Exchange

   When this message is sent:

   This message is sent in all ECMQV_ECQV-based cipher suites.

   Meaning of the message:

   This message is used to convey the client's ephemeral ECMQV public
   key.

   Structure of this message:

   The ClientKeyExchange message mimics [RFC4492] as follows.

       enum { implicit, explicit } PublicValueEncoding;

   implicit, explicit: For ECMQV_ECQV cipher suites, this indicates
   whether the client's has one ECMQV public key in the client's
   certificate ("implicit") and is providing one ephemeral ECMQV public
   key or if it is providing two ephemeral ECMQV public keys, in the
   ClientKeyExchange message ("explicit").

       struct {
           select (PublicValueEncoding) {
               case implicit:
                   ECPoint ecmqv_q2;
               case explicit: struct {
                   ECPoint ecmqv_q1;
                   ECPoint ecmqv_q2;
               };
           } ecmqv_public;
       } ClientECMQVPublic;

   ecmqv_q1: Contains the client's ephemeral ECMQV public key as a byte
   string ECPoint.point, which may represent an elliptic curve point in
   uncompressed or compressed format.  Here, the format MUST conform to
   what the server has requested through a Supported Point Formats
   Extension if this extension was used, and MUST be uncompressed if
   this extension was not used.

   ecmqv_q2: Is the same as above.

   The ClientKeyExchange message is extended as follows.

               case ecmqv:
                   ClientECMQVPublic;
           } exchange_keys;
       } ClientKeyExchange;

   Actions of the sender:

   The client selects an ephemeral ECMQV public key corresponding to the
   parameters it received from the server according to the ECKAS-MQV
   scheme as specified in [SEC1], Section 6.2.  It conveys this
   information to the client in the ClientKeyExchange message using the
   format defined above.

   Actions of the receiver:

   The server retrieves the client's ephemeral ECMQV public key(s) from
   the ClientKeyExchange message, checks that the public key(s) is(are)
   on the same elliptic curve as the server's ECMQV key, and validates
   the ephemeral public keys in accordance with [SEC1], Section 6.2.2.

   The premaster secret is formed as follows.  First, recover the static
   public key in the ECQV certificate as described in [SEC4], Section
   2.5, and then perform the ECMQV computation as described in [SEC1],
   Section 6.2.  Let premaster secret be the octet string produced by
   this computation.

5.  ECMQV_ECQV-Based Cipher Suites

5.1.  ECMQV_ECQV Cipher Suites Using the SHA-1 Hash Function

   The document specifies four cipher suites using ECMQV key exchange
   and ECQV certificates with RC-4, Triple-DES (3DES), or Advanced
   Encryption Standard (AES) encryption and the SHA-1 hash function:

     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_RC4_128_SHA          = {0xXX,0xXX};
     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA     = {0xXX,0xXX};
     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA      = {0xXX,0xXX};
     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA      = {0xXX,0xXX};

5.2.  ECMQV_ECQV Cipher Suites Using the SHA2 Hash Function Family

   The document specifies two cipher suites using ECMQV key exchange and
   ECQV certificates with AES encryption and the SHA2 hash function
   family:

     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256   = {0xXX,0xXX};
     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384   = {0xXX,0xXX};

   The above two cipher suites are the same as the corresponding AES
   cipher suites in Section 5.1 above, except for the hash and PRF
   algorithms, which are as follows.

   For TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256:

   o  The MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA-256 as the hash function.

   o  When negotiated in a version of TLS prior to 1.2, the PRF from
      that version is used; otherwise the PRF is the TLS version 1.2 PRF
      [RFC5246] with SHA-256 as the hash function.

   For TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384:

   o  The MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA-384 as the hash function.

   o  When negotiated in a version of TLS prior to 1.2, the PRF from
      that version is used; otherwise the PRF is the TLS version 1.2 PRF
      [RFC5246] with SHA-384 as the hash function.

5.3.  ECMQV_ECQV Cipher Suites Using AES-MMO Hash Functions

   The document specifies two cipher suites using ECMQV key exchange and
   ECQV certificates with AES encryption and AES-MMO hash functions:

    CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_AES_128_CCM_AES_128_MMO = {0xXX,0xXX};

    CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_AES_128_CCM_AES_256_MMO = {0xXX,0xXX};

   The AES-MMO hash functions are specified in [ZigBee], Section B.6.

   These two cipher suites are similar to the above and are included to
   accommodate the Certificate-Based Key Establishment (CBKE) scheme in
   [ZigBeeSE].

   o  The MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with AES-128-MMO or AES-256-MMO,
      respectively, as the hash function.

   o  When negotiated in a version of TLS prior to 1.2, the PRF from
      that version is used; otherwise the PRF is the TLS version 1.2 PRF
      [RFC5246] with AES-128-MMO or AES-256-MMO, respectively, as the
      hash function.

6.  ECMQV_ECQV-Based Cipher Suites With NULL Encryption

   This section specifies cipher suites using the NULL encryption
   algorithm.  As a result, these cipher suites provide only
   authentication, not confidentiality.

6.1.  ECMQV_ECQV Cipher Suite Using the SHA-1 Hash Function with NULL
      Encryption

   The following cipher suite matches the cipher suites defined in
   Section 5.1, except that we define a suite with NULL encryption.

       CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_NULL_SHA             = {0xXX,0xXX};

6.2.  ECMQV_ECQV Cipher Suites Using the SHA2 Hash Function Family with
      NULL Encryption

   The following two cipher suites are the same as the corresponding
   cipher suites in Section 5.2, but with NULL encryption.

     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_NULL_SHA256          = {0xXX,0xXX};
     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_NULL_SHA384          = {0xXX,0xXX};

6.3.  ECMQV_ECQV Cipher Suites Using AES-MMO Hash Functions with NULL
      Encryption

   The following two cipher suites are the same as the corresponding
   cipher suites in Section 5.3, but with NULL encryption.

     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_NULL_AES_128_MMO     = {0xXX,0xXX};
     CipherSuite TLS_ECMQV_ECQV_WITH_NULL_AES_256_MMO     = {0xXX,0xXX};

7.  Security Considerations

   This document provides new cipher suites for the Transport Layer
   Security protocol.  For the most part, the security considerations
   involved in using the Transport Layer Security protocol apply.
   Additionally, implementers should be aware of security considerations
   specific to elliptic curve cryptography.

   For ECMQV authenticated key exchange, the current best known
   technique for breaking the cryptosystems is by solving the elliptic
   curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP).

   The difficulty of breaking the ECDLP depends on the size and quality
   of the elliptic curve parameters.  Certain types of curves can be
   more susceptible to known attacks than others.  For example, curves
   over finite fields GF(2^m), where m is composite, may be susceptible
   to an attack based on the Weil descent.  All of the named curves
   specified in [RFC4492], Section 5.1.1, do not have this problem.
   System administrators should be cautious when enabling named curves
   other than the ones specified in [RFC4492] or in supporting explicit
   curves, and should make a more detailed investigation into the
   security of the curve in question.

   It is believed (see for example Section B.2.1 of [SEC1]) that when
   curve parameters are generated at random the curves will be resistant
   to special attacks, and must rely on the most general attacks.  The
   named curves in [RFC4492], Section 5.1.1, were all generated
   verifiably pseudorandomly.  The runtime of general attacks depends on
   the algorithm used.  At present, the best known algorithm is the
   Pollard-rho method.  (Shor's algorithm for quantum computers can
   solve the ECDLP in polynomial time, but at present large-scale
   quantum computers have not been constructed and significant
   experimental physics and engineering work needs to be done before
   large-scale quantum computers can be constructed.  There is no solid
   estimate as to when this may occur, but it is widely believed to be
   at least 20 years from the present.)

   Based on projections of computation power, it is possible to estimate
   the running time of the best known attacks based on the size of the
   finite field.  Table 1 in [RFC4492] gives an estimate of the
   equivalence between elliptic curve field size and symmetric key size.
   Roughly speaking, an N-bit elliptic curve offers the same security as
   an N/2-bit symmetric cipher, so a 256-bit elliptic curve (such as the
   secp256r1 curve) is suitable for use with 128-bit AES, for example.

   Many estimates consider that 2^80-2^90 operations are beyond
   feasible, so that would suggest using elliptic curves of at least
   160-180 bits.  The REQUIRED curves in this documents are 256-, 384-,



Campagna & Stebila        Expires July 20, 2010                [Page 19]

   and 521-bit curves; implementations SHOULD NOT use curves smaller
   than 160 bits.

   A detailed discussion on the security considerations of elliptic
   curve domain parameters and the ECMQV algorithm can be found in
   Appendix B of [SEC1].

   Additionally, the cipher suites defined in this document rely on the
   SHA-1 hash function, the SHA2 family of hash functions, and the AES-
   MMO hash function, as well as the DES, Triple-DES, and AES block
   ciphers.  The appropriate security considerations of the documents
   defining those functions apply.  Although some weaknesses have been
   discovered in SHA-1, it still provides a reasonable level of security
   for lower security lebels.  No weaknesses in the SHA2 family are
   known at present.  The SHA2 family consists of four variants -- SHA-
   224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-521 -- named after their digest
   lengths.  In the absence of special purpose attacks exploiting the
   specific structure of the hash function, the difficulty of finding
   collisions, preimages, and second preimages for the hash function is
   related to the digest length.

   Since ECMQV allow for elliptic curves of arbitrary sizes and thus
   arbitrary security strength, it is important that the size of
   elliptic curve be chosen to match the security strength of other
   elements of the cipher suite.  In particular, key sizes, hashing
   algorithms and bulk encryption algorithms must be chosen
   appropriately.  Information regarding estimated equivalence of key
   sizes is available in [NIST-800-57]; the discussion in [RFC3766] is
   also relevant.

   System administrators and implementers should take careful
   consideration of the security issues when enabling curves other than
   the named curves defined in [RFC4492].  Not all elliptic curves are
   secure, even if they are over a large field.

   Implementers SHOULD ensure that any ephemeral private keys or random
   values -- including the ephemeral private key values in ECMQV -- are
   generated from a random number generator or a properly-seed
   pseudorandom number generator, are protected from leakage, are not
   reused outside of the context of the protocol in this document, and
   are erased from memory when no longer needed.  Additionally,
   implementers SHOULD ensure that any public keys received are
   validated as per the specification to avoid known attacks.

1.  Introduction

   Enterprise applications (such as databases) have requirements that go
   beyond the traditional use cases for NFS.  The requirements falls
   into two broad categories: (1) data integrity and (2) quality of
   service.  This document proposes a set of operatons for a future
   minor version of NFSv4 to support requirements of enterprise
   applications.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Operation XX: INITIALIZE - Initialize File

2.1.  ARGUMENT

   struct INITIALIZE4args {
              /* CURRENT_FH: file */
              stateid4        ia_stateid;
              offset4         ia_offset;
              length4         ia_blocksize
              length4         ia_blockcount;
              length4         ia_reloff_pattern;
              length4         ia_reloff_blocknum;
              opaque          ia_pattern<>;
   };


2.2.  RESULT

    nfsstat4;

2.3.  MOTIVATION

   Most enterprise applications that use files almost always need to
   initialize such files to a known state.  Even with existing files,
   after such a file grows, the application needs to initialize the
   expanded region the file.  The most trivial initial state is
   intialize every byte to zero.  The problem with initializing to zero
   is that it is often difficult to distinguish a byte-range of
   initialized to all zeroes from data corruption, since a pattern of
   zeroes is a probable pattern for corruption.  Instead, some
   applications, such as database management systems, use pattern
   consisting of bytes or words of non-zero values.  Ideally one would

   like to efficiently initialize an entire file to a specified pattern
   without having to send WRITE requests for the entire file.  The
   INITIALIZE operation is bandwidth conserving operation for
   initializing file state.

2.4.  DESCRIPTION

   The INITIALIZE operation is used to initialize an open file to an
   iterated pattern.  The pattern consists of a fixed string, and a
   block number.  The pattern is defined by the arguments.

   o  ia_offset: where to start the iterated pattern.  This value is
      specified in bytes.

   o  ia_blocksize: the size of each iteration of the pattern.  Each
      iteration is called a block.

   o  ia_reloff_pattern: the relative offset within a block where to
      write the specified pattern encoded in ia_pattern.

   o  ia_reloff_blocknum: the relative offset within a block where to
      write a 64 bit block number.  The block number is incremented once
      a block is written.  The block number is always written in little
      endian order.  If ia_reloff_blocknum is set to NFS4_UINT64_MAX,
      then this informs the server that no block number is to be
      written.

   o  ia_pattern: a fixed string written to every block.  If the length
      of ia_pattern is zero, then this informs the server that no string
      is to be written.

   The field ia_stateid is the stateid corresponding to the current
   filehandle's share reservation, delegation, or byte range lock.

   An example will illustrate how the client uses INITIALIZE.  Suppose
   the arguments (except for ia_stateid) are: { 0, 500, 1000, 8, 0,
   "DeadBeef" }.  Then starting with offset zero, the content of the
   file will have these contents.

   8      'D' 'e' 'a' 'd' 'B' 'e' 'e' 'f'
   16-499 zeroes

   500    0   0   0   0   0   0   0   1
   508    'D' 'e' 'a' 'd' 'B' 'e' 'e' 'f'

   499508  'D' 'e' 'a' 'd' 'B' 'e' 'e' 'f'
   499516-499999 zeroes


2.5.  IMPLEMENTATION

   When an NFS server receives this operation, instead of writing the
   iterated pattern over each block, it should de-allocate the data of
   affected range of the file and record the the values of ia_offset,
   ia_blocksize, ia_blockcount, ia_reloff_pattern, ia_reloff_blocknum,
   and ia_pattern<> in the file's system metadata.  When a client sends
   a READ request, instead of returning zeroes, it should construct a
   response corresponding to the pattern specified in the arguments to
   INITIALIZE.

   An application likely has a legacy pattern for initialized blocks
   which cannot be mapped to that specified for INITIALIZE.  The
   application should modified to detect that the block corresponds to
   INITIALIZE's pattern.  When the application sees such a block, it can
   overwrite the block with the legacy pattern.  Note that will cause
   the block to be allocated on the NFS server.

   When the length of ia_pattern is zero and the value of
   ia_reloff_blocknum is NFS4_UINT64_MAX, then the client is requesting
   that a hole be punched into the file.

    access pattern

       default:
               void;
      };


3.3.  MOTIVATION

   The client is in a better position to deduce the intended I/O pattern
   than the server, especially if the application provides this
   information.  With this information, the server can optimize I/O to
   the file.

3.4.  DESCRIPTION

   The IO_ADVISE operation is used advise the server as to how the
   holder of the stateid intends to access the file over the specified
   byte range (iod_offset through iod_offset + ioaa_count - 1).

   o  IO_ADVISE4_SEQUENTIAL_CACHE: Sequential access to data expected.
      The server should leave data in its cache.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_SEQUENTIAL_DONTCACHE: Sequential access to data
      expected.  The server does not need to leave data in its cache.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_RANDOM: Random access to data expected.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_PREFETCH: Stateid holder expects to access the data
      soon; prefetch data in preparation.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_PREFETCH_OPPORTUNISTIC: Stateid holder expects to
      access the data soon; prefetch if it can be done at a marginal
      cost.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_INTENT_TO_WRITE: Byte range will be written soon so no
      point in caching data.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_RECENTLY_USED: The client has recently accessed the
      byte range in its own cache.  This informs the server that the
      data in the byte range remains important to the client.  When the
      server reaches resource exhaustion, knowing which data is more
      important allows the server to make better choices about which
      data to, for example purge from a cache, or move to secondary
      storage.  It also informs the server which delegations are more
      important, since if delegations are working correctly, once
      delegated to a client, a server might never receive another I/O
      request for the file.

   The results indicate which advice the server intends to follow.  The
   server MUST NOT return an error if it does not recognize or does not
   support the requested advice.  The server MAY return different advice
   than what the client requested.  If it does, then this might be due
   to one of several conditions, including, but not limited to: another
   client advising of a different I/O access pattern; a different I/O
   access pattern from another client that that the server has
   heuristically detected; or the server is not able to support the
   requested I/O access pattern, perhaps due to a temporary resource
   limitation (for example, a request for IO_ADVISE4_SEQUENTIAL_CACHE
   might not be supported because the server cannot afford to cache
   data, and/or cannot afford to queue read-a-head requests).

4.3.  MOTIVATION

   Under some circumstances, the IO_ADVISE operation is insufficient
   when the client is also performing a READ operation.  Some advice
   needs to be communicated atomically with the READ operation and an
   IO_ADVISE in the same COMPOUND operation as the READ operation would
   fail to provide the necessary advice.  For example, if IO_ADVISE
   proceeded READ, and the server was given advice to not cache the data
   requested by READ, the IO_ADVISE would be too late, because the
   server might already have cached the data.  If IO_ADVISE preceded
   READ, in order to be effective, the advice would have to be
   communicated across two operations in the same COMPOUND.  This would
   complicate the server implementation.

   addition to providing I/O hints, READ_WITH_ADVICE uses 64 bit data
   lengths, which anticipates the expected improvements in average
   network speeds and network buffer capacities.  Because the XDR
   standard does not support 64 bit array lengths, the large_buffer4
   data type is introduced to encode an array of zero or more buffers of
   fixed size of 2^32 bytes, followed by a variable length array of up
   to 2^32 - 1 bytes

       default:
               void;
      };


5.3.  MOTIVATION

   Under some circumstances, the IO_ADVISE operation is insufficient
   when the client is also performing a WRITE operation.  Some advice
   needs to be communicated atomically with the WRITE operation and an
   IO_ADVISE in the same COMPOUND operation as the WRITE operation would
   fail to provide the necessary advice.  For example, if IO_ADVISE
   proceeded WRITE and the server was given advice to not cache the data
   requested by WRITE the IO_ADVISE would be too late, because the
   server might already have cached the data.  If IO_ADVISE preceded
   WRITE in order to be effective, the advice would have to be
   communicated across two operations in the same COMPOUND.  This would
   complicate the server implementation.

   This operation adds a new enumerated value for stable_how4 called
   LAYOUT_SYNC4 in order to reduce the need for LAYOUT_COMMIT
   operations.

5.4.  DESCRIPTION

   The WRITE_WITH_ADVICE operation is used write to a file and to advise
   the server as to how the writer intends to access the file over the
   specified byte range (iod_offset through iod_offset + amount of data
   in wwaa_data - 1).

   o  IO_ADVISE4_SEQUENTIAL_CACHE: Sequential access to data expected.
      The server should leave data in its cache.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_SEQUENTIAL_DONTCACHE: Sequential access to data
      expected.  The server does not need to leave data in its cache.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_RANDOM: Random access to data expected.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_PREFETCH_OPPORTUNISTIC: Not applicable.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_INTENT_TO_WRITE: Byte range will be over-written soon
      so no point in caching data.

   o  IO_ADVISE4_RECENTLY_USED: Explicit hint to keep data of byte range
      in cache.

   The results indicate which advice the server intends to follow.  The
   server MUST NOT return an error if it does not recognize or does not
   support the requested advice.

   The intent is that WRITE_WITH_ADVICE is preferred over WRITE.  In
   addition to providing I/O hints, WRITE_WITH_ADVICE uses 64 bit data
   lengths, which anticipates the expected improvements in average
   network speeds and network buffer capacities.  Because the XDR
   standard does not support 64 bit array lengths, the large_buffer4
   data type is introduced to encode an array of zero or more buffers of
   fixed size of 2^32 bytes, followed by a variable length array of up
   to 2^32 - 1 bytes

   If general, if the value of wwaa_stable is valid, then the value of
   wwar_committed in the reply MUST NOT be less than the value of
   wwaa_stable.  The exception is if the wwaa_stable is LAYOUT_SYNC4.
   LAYOUT_SYNC4 is an enumerated value that can be used by the client
   when the server is an pNFS data server, and the client has a layout
   that covers the byte range specified by iod_offset and the amlount of
   data in wwaa_data.  If the client sends a WRITE_WITH_ADVICE to a data
   server with wwaa_stable set to LAYOUT_SYNC4, then a successful reply
   MUST return value of wwar_committed equal to LAYOUT_SYNC4 or
   FILE_SYNC4.  Regardless what value wwaa_stable is, if the server is a
   pNFS data server, it MAY return a value of wwar_committed equal to
   LAYOUT_SYNC4.  Whenever wwar_committed is LAYOUT_SYNC4, this
   indicates that range of the layout covered by iod_offset and
   wwar_count has been committed to the metadata server, and there is
   not need to send a LAYOUT_COMMIT for that range.

7.3.  MOTIVATION

   The introduction of the session model in NFSv4.1 imposes an explicit
   limitation on the number of outstanding requests a client can make of
   an NFS server.  In enterprise applications, it is possible each NFS
   request corresponds to a single application request.  Thus, the size
   of the slot table can bound the number of outstanding application

   requests.  While there are workarounds (examples include (1)implement
   a mapping layer between application's request slot list and the
   client's slot table (2) create additional sessions in order to
   preserve a one-to-one mapping between application and client slots),
   these workarounds introduce complexity.  The application's needs for
   more slots are dynamic.  The NFSv4.1 model assumes a dynamic slot
   table, but the size of the slot table is driven by the server via the
   reply to the SEQUENCE operation and the CB_RECALL_SLOT operation.
   What is missing is a method for the client to request a larger slot
   table.

7.4.  DESCRIPTION

   This operation allows the client to request changes to the session's
   parameters.  There are three major fields in the arguments and
   results:

   o  sc_flags.  These flags correspond to the csa_flags and csr_flags
      argument and result of CREATE_SESSION.  In the result, the value
      of a bit in sc_flags MUST be one of:

      *  The corresponding bit in sc_flags of the arguments to
         SESSION_CTL.

      *  The corresponding bit in sc_flags of the result of the previous
         SESSION_CTL that the server executed.

      *  If the server has not executed a previous SESSION_CTL, then the
         corresponding bit in the csr_flags field of the reply the
         CREATE_SESSION operation that created the session.

   o  sc_fore_chan_attrs.  In the arguments of SESSION_CTL, the fields
      within sc_fore_chan_attrs correspond to the fields of the argument
      csa_fore_chan_attrs in the arguments of CREATE_SESSION.  In the
      results of SESSION_CTL, the values fields within
      sc_fore_chan_attrs correspond to the fields of the result
      csr_fore_chan_attrs in the response to CREATE_SESSION.  The values
      of the fields in the result sc_fore_chan_attrs are governed
      according to the same rules that govern the values of the fields
      of csr_fore_chan_attrs.

   o  sc_back_chan_attrs.  In the arguments of SESSION_CTL, the fields
      within sc_back_chan_attrs correspond to the fields of the argument
      csa_back_chan_attrs in the arguments of CREATE_SESSION.  In the
      results of SESSION_CTL, the values fields within
      sc_back_chan_attrs correspond to the fields of the result
      csr_back_chan_attrs in the response to CREATE_SESSION.  The values
      of the fields in the result sc_back_chan_attrs are governed

      according to the same rules that govern the values of the fields
      of csr_back_chan_attrs.

   The SESSION_CTL operation MUST be sent on a COMPOUND operation
   prefixed by a SEQUENCE operation with the sa_slotid argument set to
   zero.  If SESSION_CTL requests a smaller slot table on the fore
   channel, and there are operations in progress on other slots of the
   fore channel, the server MUST do one of (1) return
   NFS4ERR_FORE_CHAN_BUSY (a new error); (2) allow SESSION_CTL to
   succeed, wait for the in progress operations to complete and reply to
   those operations before replying to SESSION_CTL; or (3) if all the in
   progress operations allow the one or both of the errors NFS4ERR_DELAY
   or NFS4ERR_SERVERFAULT, allow SESSION_CTL to succeed, abort the in
   progress operations, reply with to those operations with either
   NFS4ERR_DELAY or NFS4ERR_SERVERFAULT, and then reply to SESSION_CTL.
   Because a server is free to return NFS4ERR_FORE_CHAN_BUSY, it is
   strongly RECOMMENDED that when a client sends a SESSION_CTL operation
   that it have no other requests in progress.

   If SESSION_CTL request a smaller slot table on the backchannel and
   there are operations in progress on other slots of the backchannel,
   the server MUST do one of (1) return NFS4ERR_BACK_CHAN_BUSY; (2)
   allow SESSION_CTL to succeed, and for wait replies to the in progress
   backchannel operations before replying to SESSION_CTL; or (3) if all
   the in progress operations allow the one or both of the errors
   NFS4ERR_DELAY or NFS4ERR_SERVERFAULT, allow SESSION_CTL to succeed,
   abort the in progress operations, reply with to those operations with
   either NFS4ERR_DELAY or NFS4ERR_SERVERFAULT, and then reply to
   SESSION_CTL.  Before a client sends a SESSION_CTL operation, it
   SHOULD reply to all in progress backchannel requests of the same
   session as the SESSION_CTL operation.

8.3.  MOTIVATION

   Enterprise applications require guarantees that an operation has
   either aborted or completed.  NFSv4.1 provides this guarantee as long
   as the session is alive: simply send a SEQUENCE operation on the same
   slot with a new sequence number, and the successful return of
   SEQUENCE indicates the previous operation has completed.  However, if
   the session is lost, there is no way to know when any in progress
   operations have aborted or completed.  In hindsight, the NFSv4.1
   specification should have mandated that DESTROY_SESSION abort/
   complete all outstanding operations.

8.4.  DESCRIPTION

   A client SHOULD request the EXCHGID4_FLAG_SUPP_FENCE_OPS capability
   when it sends an EXCHANGE_ID operation.  The server SHOULD set this
   capability in the EXCHANGE_ID reply whether the client requests it or
   not.  If the client ID is created with this capability then the
   following will occur:

   o  The server will not reply to DESTROY_SESSION until all operations
      in progress are completed or aborted.

   o  The server will not reply to subsequent EXCHANGE_ID invoked on the
      same Client Owner with a new verifier until all operations in
      progress on the Client ID's session are completed or aborted.

   o  When DESTROY_CLIENTID is invoked, if there are sessions (both idle
      and non-idle), opens, locks, delegations, layouts, and/or wants
      (Section 18.49) associated with the client ID are removed.
      Pending operations will be completed or aborted before the
      sessions, opens, locks, delegations, layouts, and/or wants are
      deleted.

   o  The NFS server SHOULD support client ID trunking, and if it does
      and the EXCHGID4_FLAG_SUPP_FENCE_OPS capability is enabled, then a
      session ID created on one node of the storage cluster MUST be
      destroyable via DESTROY_SESSION.  In addition, DESTROY_CLIENTID
      and an EXCHANGE_ID with a new verifier affects all sessions
      regardless what node the sessions were created on.

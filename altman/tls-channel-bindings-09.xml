	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	    <t>Subsequent to the publication of "On Channel Bindings"
		<xref target="RFC5246"/>, three channel binding types
		for Transport Layer Security (TLS) were proposed,
		reviewed and added to the IANA channel binding type
		registry, all in accordance with <xref
		    target="RFC5246"/>.  Those channel binding types
		are: 'tls-unique', 'tls-server-end-point', and
		'tls-unique-for-telnet'.  It has become desirable to
		have these channel binding types re-registered through
		an RFC so as to make it easier to reference them, and to
		correct them to describe actual implementations.  This
		document does just that.  The authors of those three
		channel binding types have, or have indicated that they
		will, transferred "ownership" of those channel binding
		types to the IESG.</t>

	    <t>We also provide some advice on the applicability of these
		channel binding types, as well as advice on when to use
		which.  And we provide an abstract API that TLS
		implementors should provide, by which to obtain channel
		bindings data for a TLS connection.</t>

	    <t>WARNING: it turns out that the first implementor
		implemented and deployed something rather different than
		what was described in the IANA registration for
		'tls-unique'.  Subsequently it was decided that we
		should adopt that form of 'tls-unique'.  This means that
		this document
		makes a backwards-incompatible change to 'tls-unique'.
		See <xref target="changes"/> for more details.</t>

	</section>

	<section anchor='tls-unique' title="The 'tls-unique' Channel Binding Type">

	    <t>IANA is hereby directed to update the registration of the
		'tls-unique' channel binding type to match the
		following.  There are material and substantial changes
		from the original registration, both in the description
		as well as registration meta-data (such as registration
		ownership).</t>

	    <section title="Description">

		<t>Description: The first TLS Finished message sent
		    (note: the Finished struct) in the most recent TLS
		    handshake of the TLS connection being bound to
		    (note: TLS connection, not session, so that the
		    channel binding is specific to each connection
		    regardless of whether session resumption is used).
		    If TLS re-negotiation takes place before the channel
		    binding operation, then the first TLS Finished
		    message sent of the latest/inner-most TLS connection
		    is used.  Note that for full TLS handshakes the
		    first Finished message is sent by the client, while
		    for abbreviated TLS handshakes (session resumption)
		    the first Finished message is sent by the
		    server.</t>

		<t>Interoperability note: this definition of tls-unique
		    means that the channel's bindings data may change
		    over time, which in turn creates a synchronization
		    problem should the channel's bindings data change
		    between the time that the client initiates
		    authentication with channel
		    binding and the time that the server begins to
		    process the client's first authentication message.
		    If that happens the authentication will fail
		    spuriously.  To avoid this problem client
		    applications SHOULD ensure that TLS re-negotiation
		    does not occur between the start and completion of
		    authentication.</t>

		<t>WARNING: The definition, security and
		    interoperability considerations of this channel
		    binding type have changed since the original
		    registration.  Implementors should read the document
		    that last updated this registration for more
		    information.</t>

	<section title="Applicability of TLS Channel Binding Types">

	    <t>The 'tls-unique-for-telnet' channel binding type is only
		applicable to TELNET <xref target="RFC0854"/>, and is
		available for all TLS connections.</t>

	    <t>The 'tls-unique' channel binding type is available for
		all TLS connections, while 'tls-server-end-point' is
		only available when TLS cipher suites with server
		certificates are used, specifically: cipher suites that
		use the Certificate handshake message, which
		typically involve the use of PKIX <xref
		    target='RFC5280'/>.  For example,
		'tls-server-end-point' is available when using TLS
		ciphers suites such as (this is not an exhaustive list):

		<list style='symbols'>
		    <t>TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_RSA_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_SRP_SHA_DSS_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_SRP_SHA_RSA_WITH_*</t>
		</list>

		but is not available when using TLS cipher suites such
		as (this is not an exhaustive list):

		<list style='symbols'>
		    <t>TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_DH_anon_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_ECDH_anon_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_KRB5_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_PSK_WITH_*</t>
		    <t>TLS_SRP_SHA_WITH_*</t>
		</list>

		Nor is this channel binding type available for use with
		OpenPGP server certificates <xref target='RFC5081'/>
		<xref target='RFC4880'/> (since these don't use the
		Certificate handshake message).

	    </t>

	    <t>Therefore 'tls-unique' is generally better than
		'tls-server-end-point'.  However, 'tls-server-end-point'
		may be used with existing TLS server-side proxies
		("concentrators") without modification to the proxies,
		whereas 'tls-unique' may require firmware or software
		updates to server-side proxies.  Therefore there may be
		cases where 'tls-server-end-point' may interoperate but
		where 'tls-unique' may not.</t>

	    <t>Also, authentications mechanisms may arise which depend
		on channel bindings to contribute entropy, in which case
		unique channel bindings would have to always be used in
		preference to end-point channel bindings.  At this time
		there are no such mechanisms, though one such SASL
		mechanism has been proposed.  Whether such mechanisms
		should be allowed is out of scope for this document.</t>

	    <t>In other words, for many applications there may be two
		potentially applicable TLS channel binding types.
		Channel binding is all or nothing for the GSS-API <xref
		    target="RFC2743"/>, and likely other frameworks.
		Therefore agreement on the use of channel binding, and a
		particular channel binding type is necessary.  Such
		agreement can be obtained a priori, by convention, or
		negotiated.</t>

	    <t>The specifics of whether and how to negotiate channel
		binding types are beyond the scope of this document.
		However, it is RECOMMENDED that application protocols
		making use of TLS channel bindings, use 'tls-unique'
		exclusively, except, perhaps, where server-side proxies
		are common in deployments of an application protocol.
		In the latter case an application protocol MAY specify
		that 'tls-server-end-point' channel bindings must be
		used when available, with 'tls-unique' being used when
		'tls-server-end-point' channel bindings are not
		available.  Alternatively, the application may negotiate
		which channel binding type to use, or may make the
		choice of channel binding type configurable.</t>

	    <t>Specifically, application protocol specifications MUST
		indicate at least one mandatory to implement channel
		binding type, MAY specify a negotiation protocol, MAY
		allow for out-of-band negotiation or configuration, and
		SHOULD have a preference for 'tls-unique' over
		'tls-server-end-point'.</t>

	</section>

        <section title="Required Application Programming Interfaces">

	    <t>TLS implementations supporting the use of 'tls-unique'
		and/or 'tls-unique-for-telnet' channel binding types,
		MUST provide application programming interfaces by which
		applications (clients and servers both) may obtain the
		channel bindings for a TLS connection.  Such interfaces
		may be expressed in terms of extracting the channel
		bindings data for a given connection and channel binding
		type.  Alternatively the implementor may provide
		interfaces by which to obtain the initial client
		Finished message, the initial server Finished message
		and/or the server certificate (in a form that matches
		the description of the 'tls-server-end-point' channel
		binding type).  In the latter case the application has
		to have knowledge of the channel binding type
		descriptions from this document.  This document takes no
		position on which form these application programming
		interfaces must take.</t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="changes" title="Description of backwards-incompatible changes made herein to 'tls-unique'">

	    <t>The original description of 'tls-unique' read as follows:
	    </t>

	    <figure title="Original 'tls-unique' description">
		<artwork>
   |OLD| Description: The client's TLS Finished message (note: the
   |OLD| Finished struct) from the first handshake of the connection
   |OLD| (note: connection, not session, so that the channel binding
   |OLD| is specific to each connection regardless of whether session
   |OLD| resumption is used).
		</artwork>
	    </figure>

	    <t>In other words: the client's Finished message from the
		first handhske of a connection, regardless of whether
		that handshake was a full or abbreviated handshake, and
		regardless of how many subsequent handshakes
		(re-negotiations) might have followed.</t>

	    <t>As explained in <xref target="intro"/> this is no longer
		the description of 'tls-unique', and the new description
		is not backwards compatible with the original except in
		the case of TLS connections where: a) only one handshake
		has taken place before application-layer authentication,
		and b) that one handshake was a full handshake.</t>

	    <t>This change has a number of implications:

		<list style='symbols'>

		    <t>Backwards-incompatibility.  It is possible that
			some implementations of the original
			'tls-unique' channel binding type may have been
			deployed.  We know of at least one TLS
			implementation that exports 'tls-unique' channel
			bindings with the original semantics, but we
			know of no deployed application using the
			same.  Implementations of the original and new
			'tls-unique' channel binding type will only
			interoperate when: a) full TLS handshakes are
			used, b) TLS re-negotiation is not used.</t>

		    <t>Security considerations -- see <xref
			    target='seccons'/>.</t>

		    <t>Interoperability considerations.  As described in
			<xref target='tls-unique'/> the new definition
			of the 'tls-unique' channel binding type has an
			interoperability problem that may result in
			spurious authentication failures unless the
			client implements the technique described in
			that section.</t>

	<section title="IANA Considerations">

	    <t>The IANA is hereby directed to update three existing

	</section>

	<section anchor='seccons' title="Security Considerations">

	    <t>The Security Considerations sections of <xref
		    target="RFC5056"/>, <xref target="RFC5246"/> and
		<xref target="RFC5746"/> apply to this document.</t>

	    <t>The TLS Finished messages (see section 7.4.9 of <xref
		    target="RFC5246"/>) are known to both endpoints of a
		TLS connection, and are cryptographycally bound to it.
		For implementations of TLS that correctly handle
		re-negotiation <xref target="RFC5746"/> each handshake
		on a TLS connection is bound to the preceding handshake,
		if any.  Therefore the TLS Finished messages can be
		safely used as a channel binding provided that the
		authentication mechanism doing the channel binding
		conforms to the requirements in <xref
		    target='RFC5056'/>.  Applications utilizing
		'tls-unique' channel binding with TLS implementations
		without support for secure re-negotiation <xref
		    target="RFC5746"/> MUST ensure that that
		ChangeCipherSpec has been used in any and all
		re-negotiations prior to application-layer
		authentication, and MUST discard any knowledge learned
		from the server prior to the completion of
		application-layer authentication.</t>

	    <t>The server certificate, when present, is also
		cryptographically bound to the TLS connection through
		its use in key transport and/or authentication of the
		server (either by dint of its use in key transport, by
		its use in signing key agreement, or by its use in key
		agreement).  Therefore the server certificate is
		suitable as an end-point channel binding as described in
		<xref target='RFC5056'/>.</t>

	    <section title="Cryptographic Algorithm Agility">

		<t>The 'tls-unique' and 'tls-unique-for-telnet' channel
		    binding types do not add any use of cryptography
		    beyond that used by TLS itself.  Therefore these two
		    channel binding types add no considerations with
		    respect to cryptographic algorithm agility.</t>

		<t>The 'tls-server-end-point' channel binding type
		    consist of a hash of a server certificate.  The
		    reason for this is to produce manageably small
		    channel binding data, as some implementations will
		    be using kernel-mode memory (which is typically
		    scarce) to store these.  This use of a hash
		    algorithm is above and beyond TLS's use of
		    cryptography, therefore the 'tls-server-end-point'
		    channel binding type has a security consideration
		    with respect to hash algorithm agility.  The
		    algorithm to be used, however, is derived from the
		    server certificate's signature algorithm as
		    described in <xref target="tsep-desc"/>; to recap:
		    use SHA-256 if the certificate signature algorithm
		    uses MD5 or SHA-1, else use whatever hash function
		    the certificate uses (unless the signature algorithm
		    uses no hash functions or more than one hash
		    function, in which case 'tls-server-end-point' is
		    undefined).  This construction automatically makes
		    'tls-server-end-point' hash algorithm agile, with a
		    dependency on PKIX and TLS for hash agility.</t>

		<t>Current proposals for randomized signatures
		    algorithms <xref target="I-D.irtf-cfrg-rhash"/>
		    <xref target="NIST-SP.800-106.2009"/> use hash
		    functions in their construction -- a single hash
		    function in each algorithm.  Therefore the
		    'tls-server-end-point' channel binding type should
		    be available even in cases where new signatures
		    algorithms are used that are based on current
		    randomized hashing proposals (but we cannot
		    guarantee this, of course).</t>

		    concerned about was the possible impact on the
		    security of the TLS channel, of disclosure of the
		    channel bindings data by authentication mechanisms.
		    This can happen, for example, when an authentication
		    mechanism transports the channel bindings data, with
		    no confidentiality protection, over other transports
		    (for example, in communicating with a trusted third
		    party), or when the TLS channel provides no
		    confidentiality protection and the authentication
		    mechanism does not protect the confidentiality of
		    the channel bindings data.  This section considers
		    that concern.</t>

		<t>When the TLS connection uses a cipher suite that does
		    not provide confidentiality protection, the TLS
		    Finished messages will be visible to eavesdroppers,
		    regardless of what the authentication mechanism
		    does.  The same is true of the server certificate
		    which, in any case, is generally visible to
		    eavesdroppers.  Therefore we must consider our
		    choices of TLS channel bindings here to be safe to
		    disclose by definition -- if that were not the case
		    then TLS with cipher suites that don't provide
		    confidentiality protection would be unsafe.
		    Furthermore, the TLS Finished message construction
		    depends on the security of the TLS PRF, which in
		    turn needs to be resistant to key recovery attacks,
		    and we think that it is, as it is based on HMAC, and
		    the master secret is, well, secret (and the result
		    of key exchange).</t>

		<t>Note too that in the case of an attempted active
		    man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker will already
		    possess knowledge of the TLS finished messages for
		    both inbound and outbound TLS channels (which will
		    differ, given that the attacker cannot force them to
		    be the same).  No additional information is obtained
		    by the attacker from the authentication mechanism's
		    disclosure of channel bindings data -- the attacker
		    already has it, even when cipher suites providing
		    confidentiality protection are provided.</t>

		<t>None of the channel binding types defined herein
		    produce channel bindings data that must be kept
		    secret.  Moreover, none of the channel binding types
		    defined herein can be expected to be private (known
		    only to the end-points of the channel), except that
		    the unique TLS channel binding types can be expected
		    to be private when a cipher suite that provides
		    confidentiality protection is used to protect the
		    Finished message exchanges and the application data
		    records containing application-layer authentication
		    messages.</t>

Abstract 

   To cope with the lack of IP multicast support in today's Internet, a 
   multiparty transport overlay architecture is presented in this 
   document. The goal behind placing the overlay paradigm at the 
   transport layer is to support both multicast-capable and non-
   multicast IP networks while providing an application-agnostic 
   delivery service for group communications. In particular, this 
   document specifies the Multiparty Transport Overlay Control Protocol 
   (MTOCP) used to create, update and remove multiparty transport trees 
   in an IP network.

1. Introduction 

   A Multiparty Transport Overlay (MTO) is generic, scalable, and 
   efficient transport service for group communications. MTO allows 
   hiding the heterogeneity of underlying networks in terms of IP 
   multicast capabilities and IPv4/v6 support; thus allowing any user to 
   participate in a multiparty delivery session irrespective of the 
   network he/she is attached to and in a transparent manner to the 
   application.  

   The MTO applies the overlay paradigm at the transport layer, while 
   most of the existing multiparty overlay solutions, whether in the 
   conceptual stage or deployed in today's networks, either use some 
   form of IP tunnelling (e.g. AMT [6]) or specify application layer 
   protocols [7]. The study of the prior art raised the lack of generic 
   MTO (some multiparty technologies are application-dependent while 
   others do not support IP multicast [2]) as well as the lack of 
   dynamic transport group management functionalities. 

   Conceptually, an MTO is a transport tree made up of overlay nodes 
   (ONs). The root of the tree represents the source overlay node; the 
   closest overlay node to the data source. The leaf of the tree (the 
   leaf overlay node) is the closest overlay node to the receiver.  

   The branches of the MTO tree are made of transport connections. Each 
   transport connection is identified by a unicast source address and 
   port, and a unicast/multicast destination address and port.  Each ON 
   forwards data from one incoming transport connection to one or 
   multiple transport connections based on its own forwarding table.   

   In addition, each overlay node has to maintain mapping information 
   between the multiparty transport connection ID (actually, equivalent 
   to MTO tree ID) and the IDs of associated multicast and unicast 
   transport connections forming the branches of the MTO tree. 

   In the proposed design, The MTO tree ID is only used to manage the 
   transport connections of a given MTO tree (i.e. addition or removal 
   of multicast/unicast transport connections of an MTO tree). In 
   particular, the MTO tree ID is not included in the data packets and 
   it is not explicitly used by the packet forwarding process on the 
   ONs. Indeed, each ON forwards data packets based on local information

   of its forwarding table indicating that packets received on a given 
   "input" unicast/multicast transport connection are to be forwarded  
   to one or more "output" unicast/multicast transport connections. 
   Thus, the proposed design allows avoiding any extra overhead in data 
   packets related to identifying which MTO tree the data packets will 
   be delivered through. 

   To properly manage the MTO tree, an MTO controller entity is defined. 
   In particular, this entity is in charge of creating, updating and 
   removing multiparty transport trees in an IP network. All those 
   operations are enabled by the Multiparty Transport Overlay Control 
   Protocol (MTOCP) defined in the present document. The proposed design 
   is centralized and typically applies to a single operator domain, but 
   it could also apply to a multi-operator scenario. A decentralized 
   design, encompassing collaboration between multiple MTO Controllers, 
   is out of the scope of the present document. 

   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's 
   mailing list at fecframe@ietf.org and/or the authors. 

2. MTO Architecture Components 

2.1. MTO Tree  

   An MTO tree is made up of a set of ONs interconnected through 
   multicast or unicast connections. There are three types of ONs in an 
   MTO tree (see Figure 1): 

   o Source Overlay Node (S-ON): it represents the functional component 
      of the MTO tree that receives the application data flow directly 
      from the source. 

   o Leaf Overlay Node (L-ON): it represents the functional component 
      of the MTO tree that is the last hop ON from the source to the 
      receiver. 

   o On-tree Overlay Node (O-ON): it represents the functional 
      component of the MTO tree that is on the path between the S-ON and 
      L-ON. 

   Figure 1 shows an example of an MTO tree made of 5 overlay nodes and 
   connecting a source to 5 receivers. The tree is made of 2 multicast 
   transport connections and 5 unicast transport connections.

2.2. MTO Controller 

   The MTO controller (MTO-Ctrl) represents the functional component 
   that is in charge of managing the configuration of an MTO tree in the 
   network (i.e. creation/update/removal of the MTO tree). This 
   basically consists in what follows: 

   o Management of port numbers for transport connections of the MTO 
      tree: each time a new MTO tree is to be created, the MTO-Ctrl 
      SHOULD assign a couple of unique ports (source and destination 
      ports) per MTO tree. These ports SHOULD be used for all transport 
      connections belonging to a same MTO tree. This avoids any possible 
      conflicts among different MTO trees for data transmission. For 
      instance, one ON serving two different MTO trees (i.e. ON is bound 
      to two different MTO tree IDs) SHOULD have two couples of unique

      ports (one couple per MTO tree): <SrcPort1, DstPort1> and 
      <SrcPort2, DstPort2>. The MTO-Ctrl MAY choose to use a different 
      destination port for a given connection of an MTO tree. In such a 
      case the MTO-Ctrl MAY learn the destination port through a 
      mechanism which is out of the scope of the present document. For 
      example, the MTO-Ctrl MAY obtain the destination port of a unicast 
      connection terminating at a receiver from the receiver itself.   

   o Management of MTO tree ID: the MTO-Ctrl SHOULD manage the MTO tree 
      ID and ensure that a unique ID is assigned for each different MTO 
      tree.   

   o Push to (and further update for) each ON its MTO Tree-specific 
      forwarding table in the form of a list of input and output 
      transport connections.

          Figure 2 : Example of Multiparty Transport Overlay Tree. 

   As shown in Figure 2, the Multiparty Transport Overlay Control 
   Protocol (MTOCP) is used by the MTO controller to configure the 
   overlay nodes of the MTO tree.  

   The message exchange between MTO-Ctrl and ONs is carried over TCP to 
   avoid packet loss. This TCP connection is initiated by MTO-Ctrl.  

   In addition, the default listening port at ON for MTOCP protocol is 
   11224.   

3. MTO Controller Operations 

   The management of multiparty transport connections is ensured by the 
   MTO controller. This entity communicates with the different ONs of

Internet-Draft                  MTOCP                        July 2010 
    

   the MTO tree (source ON, on-tree ONs, and leaf ONs) to enable them 
   configuring their respective input and output transport connections.  

   A connection is defined in MTO-Ctrl's command as follows: 

   o <IP source address, source port, IP destination/listening address, 
      destination/listening port> for the input connection of ON, and  

   o <IP source/forwarding address, source/forwarding port, IP 
      destination address, destination port> for ON' output connection.  

   For data transport over these connections, UDP protocol is used.  

   In the following section, the different message exchange types 
   between MTO-Ctrl and ON are described. Note that in each command 
   message it sends to ON, the MTO-Ctrl includes the MTO Tree ID to 
   indicate which MTO tree it is referring to. Likewise, in each 
   response sent to MTO-Ctrl, the ON indicates the ID of the MTO tree it 
   is referring to.  

3.1. Connection Addition 

   When the MTO-Ctrl wants to add one or multiple connections to an ON 
   (on session setup or update), it sends to this ON a CONNECTION_START 
   command including the parameters of the input and/or output 
   connection(s) to be added along with the MTO tree ID of the concerned 
   overlay tree. 

   On reception of this command the ON configures its input and/or 
   output connections (as described in section 4.1. ) and replies the 
   MTO-Ctrl with an ACK_CONNECTION_START message including the result of 
   the connection configuration operation (success/failure). 

3.2. Connection Removal 

   When the MTO-ctrl wants to remove one or multiple connections of an 
   ON (e.g., on session termination or update), it sends to this ON a 
   CONNECTION_STOP command including the parameters of the input and/or 
   output connections to be deleted. On reception of this command the ON 
   deletes the entries of the concerned connections (as described in 
   section 4.1. ) and replies the MTO-Ctrl with an ACK_CONNECTION_STOP 
   message including the result of the connection deletion operation 
   (success/failure).

Internet-Draft                  MTOCP                        July 2010 
    

3.3. Connection Flush 

   The last type of command that could be sent by MTO-Ctrl to an ON is a 
   CONNECTION_FLUSH to inform the ON that it should delete all the 
   connections it has for a given MTO tree ID. On reception of such a 
   command, the ON flushes its connections list related to the MTO tree 
   ID mentioned in MTO-Ctrl's command (cf. section 4.1. ). The ON then 
   replies the MTO-ctrl with an ACK_CONNECTION_FLUSH message including 
   the result of the connection deletion operation (success/failure). 

4. ON Operations 

4.1. Control Plane 

   When an ON receives a CONNECTION_START command from MTO-Ctrl, it sets 
   up new input and/or output connections and updates its forwarding 
   table so as to consider the added connections. If MTO-Ctrl's command 
   is a CONNECTION_STOP or a CONNECTION_FLUSH, the ON stops receiving 
   from and/or forwarding traffic to the concerned connections, and 
   removes the concerned entries from the forwarding table. Also, 
   whatever the command type, the ON replies back to the MTO-Ctrl with 
   an ACK (ACK CONNECTION START, ACK CONNECTION STOP, or ACK CONNECTION 
   FLUSH). In its reply to MTO-Ctrl, the ON includes the result of the 
   operations it performed upon receiving MTO-Ctrl's command. If a 
   CONNECTION START or a CONNECTION STOP fails, the ON includes in its 
   response the list of connections that it could not add or remove for 
   some reason (e.g., the connection to be added does not correspond to 
   ON's IP address, the connection to be removed does not exist, etc).   

4.2. Data Plane 

   For a given MTO tree, the data forwarding process on ON consists in 
   receiving the traffic from an input transport connection and 
   forwarding this traffic to the appropriate output transport 
   connection(s) as indicated by its MTO Tree-specific forwarding table. 

   To receive or send multicast traffic, the ON uses the source address 
   of the multicast input (respectively, output) connection to select 
   the downstream (respectively upstream) interface. Of course, the 
   source address of the multicast input/output connection is mentioned 
   by MTO-Ctrl. ON is also an IGMP/MLD listener [4][5]. So, as such, it 
   sends an IGMP/MLD report whenever it should receive multicast packets 
   from other ONs or from the source.

5. Message Structure 

5.1. Command Message Structure 

   The command message is sent from MTO-Ctrl to ON. It includes a 
   command header (Command_Number, Command_Type, Command_Length, and 
   MTO_Tree_ID), possibly followed by zero, one or multiple connection 
   options.

      Command Number  
 
                A 32-bit unsigned integer incremented for each command.  
                It allows to match ON's responses to MTO-Ctrl's  
                commands. 
 
      Command_Type 
             
               A 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the type of command   
               sent by MTO-Ctrl to ON (CONNECTION_START,  
               CONNECTION_STOP and CONNECTION_FLUSH). The following  
               table gives the values of the different command types.

      Command_length      
 
               A 16-bit unsigned integer that represents the length (in  
               bytes) of the data field following the command header. 
 
 
      MTO_Tree_ID   
 
               A 32-bit unsigned integer serving as the unique  
               identifier of an MTO tree corresponding to a unique  
               multiparty session. 
 
5.2. Response Message Structure 

   As shown hereafter, ON's response message structure is almost the 
   same as that of MTO-Ctrl's command message structure. The response 
   message is sent from ON to MTO-Ctrl. It includes a response header 
   (Response_Number, Response_Type, Response_Length, Status, and 
   MTO_Tree_ID), possibly followed by zero, one or multiple connection 
   options.

      Response Number  
 
                A 32-bit unsigned integer set to the same value as the  
                command number of the command which this response  
                replies to. It allows to match ON's responses to MTO- 
                Ctrl's commands.

      Response_Type 
             
               A 8-bit unsigned integer. It indicates the type of 
               response sent by ON to MTO-Ctrl (ACK_CONNECTION_START,  
               ACK_CONNECTION_STOP and ACK_CONNECTION_FLUSH). The  
               following table gives the values of the different  
               response types. 
 
                     +--------------------------------+  
                     | Response Type            Value | 
                     |                                | 
                     | ACK_CONNECTION_START     4     | 
                     | ACK_CONNECTION_STOP      5     | 
                     | ACK_CONNECTION FLUSH     6     | 
                     |                                | 
                     +--------------------------------+ 
       
 
      Response_length     
 
               A 16-bit unsigned integer. It represents the length (in  
               bytes) of the data field following the response header. 
     
 
      Status 
               A 8-bit unsigned integer. It is set to zero if ON  
               detects no error upon execution of MTO-Ctrl's command.  
               Otherwise, it is set to an error value. This value  
               is followed by a list of connections concerned by the  
               failure if the response concerns an add/delete command  
               (i.e. not an ACK_CONNECTION_FLUSH). One type only of  
               error value is defined in this document: 1, for command  
               failure.   
 
 
      MTO_Tree_ID   
 
               A 32-bit unsigned integer serving as the unique  
               identifier of an MTO tree corresponding to a unique  
               multiparty session.

5.3. Connection Option 

   This field is optional, and concerns both command and response 
   messages. A connection option field contains the description of one 
   transport connection of the MTO tree. As mentioned in section 5.1. , 
   one or multiple connection options can follow the command header of a 
   CONNECTION_START or a CONNECTION_STOP command message. On the other 
   hand, this option is useless in the CONNECTION_FLUSH command message. 

   Also, connection options SHOULD be included in the response message 
   only in case of operation failure on ON when processing a 
   CONNECTION_START or a CONNECTION_STOP command.

               the connection. 
    

6. Security Considerations 

   As the present documents deals with the MTO architecture, only the 
   control plan security (security of the message exchange between the 
   MTO controller and ONs) will be considered.  

   To protect the message exchange between the MTO controller and ONs, 
   the MTO Controller SHOULD establish an IPsec SA with each ON. IPsec 
   AH [3] MAY be used during the exchange. This protection offers data 
   origin authentication and data integrity.  

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document recommends the reservation of port 11224 for the 
   exchange of command/response messages between the MTO-Ctrl and ON. 

8. Conclusions 

   This document has described the Multiparty Transport Overlay Control 
   Protocol (MTOCP) and related operations. The goal behind designing 
   such a protocol is to hide the heterogeneity of underlying networks 
   in terms of IP multicast capabilities and IPv4/v6 support; thus 
   allowing any user to participate in a multiparty delivery session 
   irrespective of the network he/she is attached to and in a 
   transparent manner to the application.

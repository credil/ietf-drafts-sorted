Internet-Draft         Encoding of ROADM                     Nov 9, 2009
Abstract

   Reconfigurable add/drop optical multiplexers(ROADM) featured highly 
   asymmetric switching capability, is an essential element in current 
   wavelength switched optical network(WSON).Because the multiple degree
   Reconfigurable add/drop optical multiplexer(ROADM) can not only add/
   drop wavelength but also switch wavelength, it is necessary to know
   the switch connectivity offered by such a network element. With the 
   development of ROADM, the constraint of wavelength and direction is 
   abated, so the encoding of the ROADM needs improvement. This memo 
   provides a novel encoding for different ROADMs, Which is applicable 
   to the encoding of different kind of ROADMs.

1. Introduction 

   Reconfigurable add/drop optical multiplexers is an essential element
   in current WSON. As the multiple degree ROADM has properties of both
   a switch and a multiplexer, it is necessary to know the switch 
   connectivity offered by such a network element.[WSON-Framework] In a 
   ROADM, there are some connectivity constraints between line side port 
   and add/drop port. An ingress or more typically an egress (drop) port
   restricted to a single channel of fixed wavelength is known as 
   colored port, while the port without such constraint is called 
   colorless port. With the development of ROADM towards colorless and 
   directionless add drop switching, the constraints mentioned above is
   abated, so the encoding of the ROADM needs improvement to accommodate
   the novel ROADMs.[ROADM-ARCH] The current encoding retains lots of 
   redundancy, in our encoding we describe the connectivity of ROADM as 
   sets of the line side port's properties to reduce the information's 
   redundancy. 

2. Encoding of ROADM

   The current encoding of ROADM is represented as Connectivity Matrix 
   Sub-TLV by encoding pairs of links, each pairs represent one 
   direction of transmission. Considering the application of 
   bi-directional fiber, some link identifiers (especially line side 
   links identifiers) appear repeatedly. Lots of redundancies due to the
   repetitional encoding of the same links will degrade the performance

   of encoding. Our novel encoding of ROADM describes the connectivity 
   as the line side port's property which contains the links that can 
   connect to the port. In online routing and wavelength assignment 
   (RWA), processing delay influences the blocking probability of the
   request. Improving the encoding can relieve the massive processing
   of information and reduce the blocking probability.

The encoding of a ROADM is:

An example of encoding


   We use the example in [WSON-Encode] to explain the encoding in 
   detail. Using our novel encoding, this representation uses only 11 
   32-bit words.The more degrees of the ROADM the better our novel 
   encoding performs. Suppose we have a typical 2-degree 40 channel

   ROADM. In addition to its two line side ports it has 80 add and 80 
   drop ports. The picture below illustrates how a typical 2-degree                          
   ROADM system that works with bi-directional fiber pairs is a highly
   asymmetrical system composed of two unidirectional ROADM subsystems.

                West Line ingress      East Line egress 
    

   Referring to the figure we see that the ingress direction of ports 
   #3-#42 (add ports) can only connect to the egress on port #1. While 
   the ingress side of port #2 (line side) can only connect to the 
   egress on ports #3-#42 (drop) and to the egress on port #1 (pass 
   through). Similarly, the ingress direction of ports #43-#82 can only
   connect to the egress on port #2 (line). While the Ji, ingress 
   direction of port #1 can only connect to the egress on ports #43-#82
   (drop) or port #2 (pass through). We can now represent this 
   connectivity as follows.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Service discovery using multicast DNS (mDNS) as defined in <xref
      target="RFC6762"></xref> is limited in scope to L3 boundaries due to the
      use of link-local scoped multicast addresses. Networks are partitioned
      into multiple segments by means of virtual local area networks (VLANs)
      or subnet creation for various reasons. The need for network wide,
      seamless service discovery demands the extension of the discovery
      protocol beyond the L3 boundary. There are also challenges in Wi-Fi
      networks when a large number of multicast messages are exchanged due to
      existing 802.11 multicast implementations.</t>

      <t>Enabling Service Discovery across L3 boundaries can be accomplished
      in one of the following ways using existing, unmodified protocols:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Unicast DNS-SD only: Use of DNS servers and allowing the client
          to use dynamic DNS updates and Long Lived Queries (LLQs) to announce
          and learn services dynamically <xref
          target="I-D.sekar-dns-llq"></xref></t>

          <t>mDNS only: Defining a mDNS gateway entity at the L3 boundary that
          will extend services across the links it is attached to</t>

          <t>Combination of unicast DNS and mDNS - Hybrid proxy approach as
          described in <xref target="I-D.cheshire-mdnsext-hybrid"></xref></t>

          <t>mDNS with extended scope multicast - Modifying mDNS to use a
          wider scope multicast address for message exchange</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>As a first step, this draft lists out the approach to use a mDNS
      gateway on a network element (2) to extend the services across all the
      network segments attached to the element. While this approach does not
      preclude (1) or (3), it allows the extension of service discovery in a
      limited number of segments with minimal provisioning. Approach (4) is
      not explored further as it would add to the flood of service discovery
      messages in the scope defined by the multicast address and it would also
      require changes on mDNS clients, which is undesirable.</t>

      <section title="Requirements">
        <t>This section describes requirements for extending multicast DNS in
        an enterprise environment:<list style="numbers">

            of the provider/user, role of the device or user

            <t>Defining and enforcing a policy to selectively filter queries
            and announcements from specific clients or over specific network
            links</t>

            <t>Filtering of link-local-only information - Services that

    <section title=" Conventions and Terminology Used in this Document   ">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
      RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].</t>

      <t>This document uses the multicast DNS and DNS terminology and
      conventions from <xref target="RFC6762"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC6763"></xref>. It uses the same convention for services on
      the same link as defined in <xref
      target="I-D.cheshire-mdnsext-hybrid"></xref>, repeated here for quick
      reference:</t>

      <t>Multicast Multicast DNS works between a hosts on the same link. A set
      of hosts is considered to be "on the same link", if:</t>

      <t>when any host A from that set sends a packet to any other host B in
      that set, using unicast, multicast, or broadcast, the entire link-layer
      packet payload arrives unmodified, and</t>

      <t>a broadcast sent over that link by any host from that set of hosts
      can be received by every other host in that set</t>

      <t>The link-layer *header* may be modified, such as in Token Ring Source
      Routing [802.5], but not the link-layer *payload*. In particular, if any
      device forwarding a packet modifies any part of the IP header or IP
      payload then the packet is no longer considered to be on the same link.
      This means that the packet may pass through devices such as repeaters,
      bridges, hubs or switches and still be considered to be on the same link
      for the purpose of this document, but not through a device such as an IP
      router that decrements the TTL or otherwise modifies the IP header.
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>mDNS gateway - An application that listens to services and
          extends the services across links</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Solution overview">
      <t>The solution introduces a mDNS gateway function which is co-located
      on the network element that connects to multiple links, typically an IP
      router. The mDNS gateway function will be responsible for:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Caching - Learn and cache services. Maintain services in the
          cache according to service announcements, service removals and the
          TTL of the records.</t>

          <t>Respond to queries - Advertise in response to queries with
          services in the cache that are not in the same link-local domain
          where the query is received.</t>

          <t>Service filtering - Filter services to be added to the cache and
          to be included in the advertisements as per configured policies.</t>

          <t>Service redistribution - forwarding of unsolicited service
          announcements across links based on configuration</t>

          <t>Active query - Service queries sent by the mDNS gateway itself to
          learn about services or keep services 'fresh' in the cache. Can be
          sent on one or more of the links the gateway is attached to.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Service Cache">
        <t>The mDNS gateway maintains a database of DNS Resource Records (RR)
        required to advertise and resolve services. At a minimum, the cache
        will contain PTR, SRV,TXT and A/AAAA RRs for each service with NSEC RR
        support for optimization. In addition, the link on which the service
        and host are seen is also remembered. This is required to refresh the
        records on TTL expiry.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Filters">
        <t>A service filtering policy is configured with an action to permit
        or deny services into the cache or to filter services included in the
        response / advertisement messages based on matching criteria. The
        matching criteria can be defined based on:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Service type</t>

            <t>Service instance names</t>

            <t>Link on which the message is received</t>

            <t>Type of message - query or advertisement</t>

            <t>Location of the host querying or advertising a service</t>
          </list>A Service filtering policy is applied for incoming and
        outgoing messages. Each link can be applied with a unique filtering
        policy.</t>

        <t>When a mDNS message is received by the mDNS gateway that matches
        the action set for the link, policy matching is executed. The incoming
        advertisement is processed against the mDNS gateway filtering policy
        applied in the incoming direction on the link where the advertisement
        is received. If the action is 'permit' the service is added to the
        cache. For a response or advertisement to be sent out, a filtering
        policy applied in the outgoing direction is processed and if the
        resulting action is 'deny' then the service and its corresponding RRs
        are not included in the message sent out.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Announcement">
        <t>The mDNS gateway listens for all service announcements. When a
        service announcement is received, the announcement and all the
        additional RRs learnt are added to the cache or ignored based on the
        result of the configured filter policy.</t>

        <t>The RRs containing link-local information e.g. A or AAAA RRs that
        contain link-local scoped addresses are not stored in the cache.</t>

        <t>When the mDNS gateway learns a service it can also forward the
        advertisement on other attached links.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Query">
        <t>The mDNS gateway processes all the queries against the configured
        filtering policy. If the response to the query is permitted then it
        constructs the answers and additional records required to resolve the
        service from its cache for the services that are permitted. Services
        that reside on the same link where the query is received are not
        included as the owner of the service will also see the query and would
        send the response directly. Only services learnt from different links
        are considered in the response.</t>

        <t>Any query received for additional RRs to resolve the service e.g.
        query for SRV, A, AAAA etc are responded to in the same way. If the
        records do not exist in the cache due to expiry or purging of cache
        for any other reason, mDNS gateway sends out an explicit query to
        fetch the records on the link where the service resides.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Probing">
        <t>According to <xref target="RFC6762"></xref> before registering a RR
        probing is performed to ensure unique names. As the mDNS gateway
        maintains cache of all the RRs that are extended across the links it
        responds to probe records like any other query. This will help in
        detecting and resolving conflicts across links for names that are
        extended across links.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service update, Service withdrawal">
        <t>When the mDNS gateway receives a service update or withdrawal it
        updates or removes the service and all corresponding records from its
        cache. It forwards the withdraw messages to other attached links.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Refresh">
        <t>The RRs describing the service and resolving it have a TTL that
        defines the validity of the RR. The mDNS gateway can continuously
        refresh each of the RRs in the cache as per the TTL rules. For the
        purpose of optimization, the mDNS gateway can rely on the host
        interested in the RRs to trigger a refresh by setting the TTLs in the
        response to the time remaining since the record was learnt by the mDNS
        gateway. If a client is interested in the RR then it would trigger a
        refresh when a fraction of the TTL is reached. While responding to
        queries from hosts, the mDNS gateway inturn sends out queries to
        refresh the records that are about to expire on the link where the
        records were learnt.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="mDNS Gateway for Wireless Network">
        <t>Deploying the mDNS gateway in wireless networks has a few
        additional requirements w.r.t to multicast radio optimization and
        mobility aspects. This section describes some additional capabilities
        added to the mDNS gateway to satisfy these requirements.</t>

        <section anchor="advertising_wireless"
                 title="Advertising services on wireless networks">
          <t>In order to conserve wireless bandwidth due to limitations of the
          multicast implementation in 802.11, the mDNS gateway sends service
          advertisements to wireless devices as L2 unicast messages.</t>

          <t>In a wireless network, the mDNS gateway co-located on the network
          element that bridges the link-local multicast packets can act as a
          passive device and respond only if wireless clients sends a mDNS
          query. When bridging is turned off sending layer 2 unicast message
          is needed to on even when the provider is on the same link as the
          requestor. Bridging of link-local mDNS messages can be turned off
          based on configuration. This is useful in the following
          scenario:</t>

          <t><list style="numbers">
              <t>Save computation resources on the device which are used to
              replicate the multicast packet as a L2 unicast for all wireless
              clients.</t>

              <t>If the wireless client is in power saving mode, sending a
              mDNS advertisement as a L2 unicast would forcefully awake the
              client and it would result into more power consumption by the
              wireless client.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>mDNS functionality is not impacted by acting as a passive gateway
          because the client would always send the mDNS query when inquiring
          for a service.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Device Tracking">
          <t>Wireless clients are mobile in nature. The mDNS gateway should
          learn the service instance only from the authenticated wireless
          client. The mDNS gateway should tag each service instance from a
          wireless client with the client's MAC address. This MAC address
          should be used for device tracking. If the wireless client leaves
          the network, the mDNS gateway should not wait until the TTL expires
          but it should actively clean up the service instance provided by
          that wireless client. This is done to protect the mDNS gateway cache
          resources.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Mobility Considerations">
          <t>Wireless deployments supports seamless mobility. In such a
          scenario, the mDNS gateway needs to be aware of the client location.
          If the location changes, the mDNS gateway needs to update its mDNS
          cache. The mDNS gateway should tag each service instance with the
          device location. The device location can be derived based on the
          Access Point (AP) to which the wireless client is attached. If the
          client, which is providing any service, changes its location, this
          change needs to be reflected in the mDNS gateway. If the client
          roams from one mDNS gateway to another mDNS gateway, then the old
          gateway should provide the service instance information pertaining
          to the roamed client to the new gateway and then it must clear the
          mDNS cache for that particular client. If the mDNS gateway is not
          acting as a passive gateway, it may choose to update the network
          about the new service instance it has learnt.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="mDNS traffic optimization">
          <t>All mDNS packets are sent to the multicast link-local IP address.
          When the mDNS gateway starts forwarding the mDNS advertisements
          across L3 boundaries then the number of such advertisement on any
          network would increase. 802.11 wireless networks operate in half
          duplex mode so any packet on air would need to contend for the
          wireless medium to transmit the packet. If there are many mDNS
          packets going on air then it would impact other data traffic. Hence
          mDNS traffic optimization is required.</t>

          <t>When services are advertised, each record has an associated TTL
          value. When the TTL expires, the gateway needs to send a query (at
          85%, 90% and 95% of the TTL) for that record to confirm its
          validity. If the TTL value of each record is different, then mDNS
          gateway needs to send a query for individual records. To minimize
          the mDNS traffic, queries for multiple RRs for that service record
          set can be initiated towards the source of the service. Such a query
          can be sent with the QU bit set as described in <xref
          target="RFC6762"></xref> to solicit a unicast response.</t>

          <t>The mDNS gateway for wireless networks should act as a passive
          gateway as explained in <xref target="advertising_wireless"></xref>.
          When it is acting as a passive gateway and bridging of mDNS packets
          is turned off it has to respond to queries on the link even when the
          provider of the service resides on the same link.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Name conflict resolution across links: Name conflict resolution
          depends on probing followed by service registration. This is done by
          the host which is providing the service. Name conflict resolution
          across links depends on the mDNS gateway cache to have a conclusive
          list of names already present to be able to authoritatively respond
          to probe requests. However, this may not always be posible due to
          timing issues when the cache gets updated, records having expired
          from the cache etc.</t>

          <t>Multi-homed hosts: There is also the case of a multihomed host
          connected via multiple links to the same mDNS gateway that may end
          up wrongly assuming conflict and getting into a continuous renaming
          loop.</t>

          <t>Multiple mDNS gateways on the link: If there are multiple mDNS
          gateways enabled on the same link queries may get duplicate
          responses.</t>

          <t>Loops in the network: If there is a loop in the network with
          multiple mDNS gateways enabled in such a topology it may end up
          continuously cycling the service around the loop and keeping the RRs
          alive forever.</t>

          <t>Refreshing resource records: Balancing an excessive number of
          queries to maintain the records in the cache vs. having the cache
          up-to-date with all the known record names requires optimizations
          that may lead to corner cases where wrong results or conflicts
          arise.</t>
        </list></t>

    <section title="Future work">
      <t>The solution documented here is limited to extending services in a
      across links attached to a single network element or mDNS gateways. For
      a broader application, the service discovery solution described in <xref
      target="I-D.cheshire-mdnsext-hybrid"></xref> should be realized with any
      provisioning as needed.</t>

      <t>Similar to auto provisioning and realization of the hybrid proxy
      approach for homenet as described in <xref
      target="I-D.stenberg-homenet-dnssdext-hybrid-proxy-ospf"></xref> a
      solution needs to be built for enterprise and campus networks extending
      what has been described in this draft.</t>

      <t>There are other considerations such as including the location
      information so that services can be ordered based on proximity of the
      service.</t>

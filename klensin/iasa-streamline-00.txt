      Streamlining the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)
                 draft-klensin-iasa-streamline-00.txt

Abstract

   There have been many opportunities to examine the functioning of the
   IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) since its creation in
   2005 and the subsequent addition of the IETF Trust to its scope.
   Suggestions to do so have generally not progressed, in part because
   of constraints imposed by the IETF Trust.  Those constraints have now
   expired.  The IASA has often fallen short of the expectations about
   openness and transparency called for in BCP 101, with members of the
   IAOC and IETF Trust claiming excessive workload as a major cause of
   that problem.  This document proposes to change the workload
   requirements.

Internet-Draft              IASA Streamlining                  July 2010


1.  Introduction

   There have been many opportunities to examine the functioning of the
   IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) since its creation in
   2005 and the subsequent addition of the IETF Trust to its scope.
   Suggestions to do so have generally not progressed, in part because
   of constraints imposed by the IETF Trust.  Those constraints have now
   expired.  The IASA has often fallen short of the expectations about
   openness and transparency called for in BCP 101 [RFC4071] [RFC4371],
   with members of the IAOC and IETF Trust claiming excessive workload
   as a major cause of that problem.  This document proposes to change
   the workload requirements.

   There is no guarantee that a change in the workload for individual
   members of the IAOC will improve transparency and communication with
   the community.  If the workload is really the cause of infrequent and
   inadequate minutes or other lapses, this specification should fix
   that.  If it is not, the proposal will create opportunities for:

   o  Better matches of people and their skills to particular tasks.
      There is no inherent reason to believe that the right set of
      skills for the IAOC in its administrative oversight rule is the
      right set of skills for the IETF Trust and its intellectual
      property and legal administration role.  Most tasks that benefit
      from shared knowledge between IAOC members and Trustees would
      benefit from broader exposure to the community even if that is
      slightly less efficient.

   o  Understanding and fixing the real problems with lack of openness
      and transparency.

   It is hence desirable in its own right although perhaps less
   compelling if the workload issue does not exist..


2.  Proposal

   Modify BCP 101 as described more specifically in the subsections
   below.

   RFC 4071 provides for the different members of the IAOC to be
   selected using a number of different mechanisms.  The IETF Trust
   Agreement and the update in RFC 4371 provides that the Trustees of
   the IETF Trust will be the same as the members of the IAOC.  That was
   certainly the best idea at the time, but some of the considerations
   that led to it no longer apply and it appears that the workload is
   excessive, especially for people with other responsibilities inside
   and outside of the IETF.  So the membership of the two bodies is now

   separated, as described in detail below for each of the categories of
   appointment or designation.

2.1.  Members Appointed by the NomCom, IESG, and IAB

   The NomCom, IESG, and IAB will continue to appoint IAOC members as
   specified in BCP 101.  At the same time, they will appoint Trustees
   for the IETF Trust, using the same procedures.  At the discretion of
   those bodies and with agreement by the appointees, the same person
   may serve in both positions, but this is not a requirement.  To the
   extent to which the appointing bodies believe that any of the
   problems with the IASA result from excessive workload for
   individuals, there is a clear advantage of appointing different
   people to the two roles.

2.2.  Member Appointed by the ISOC Board of Trustees

   The ISOC Board of Trustees will continue to appoint an IAOC member as
   specified in BCP 101.  Using the same procedure, or another procedure
   of their choosing, they will appoint a Trustee for the IETF Trust.
   They may choose to stagger the terms if they conclude that is
   desirable.  At their discretion and with agreement by the appointees,
   the same person may serve in both positions, but this is not a
   requirement or recommendation.

2.3.  IESG Member

   The IESG shall select, annually and at or immediately after the first
   IETF meeting of the year, one of their membership to serve on the
   IAOC.  The IETF Chair shall serve, ex-officio, as a Trustee of the
   IETF Trust.  The IETF Chair may serve in both roles at the discretion
   of the IESG.  There are several reasons for the IETF Chair to serve
   in both roles, but, while the Trustee one is critical given the
   relationships involved (including the role of the General Area AD
   with regard to IETF Intellectual Property work), an incumbent Chair
   and sitting IESG should be able to make decisions about balancing
   workload and priorities for IAOC representation with other other IETF
   requirements.  Within the term of the IAOC position, the appointee
   serves at the pleasure of the IESG.

2.4.  IAB Member

   The IAB shall select, annually and at or immediately after the first
   IETF meeting of the year, one of their membership to serve on the
   IAOC and one to serve as a Trustee of the IETF Trust.  The same
   person may serve in both roles at the discretion of the IAB.  There
   are several reasons for the IAB Chair to serve in one or both roles,
   but, at the time the IAB appoints its Chair, the incoming Chair and

Internet-Draft              IASA Streamlining                  July 2010


   sitting IAB should be able to make decisions about balancing
   workload, priorities for IAOC and Trustee representation, continuity,
   and other other IETF requirements.  Within the terms of the two
   positions, the appointee serves at the pleasure of the IAB.

2.5.  The ISOC President/CEO

   The ISOC President/CEO shall continue to serve, ex-officio, as a
   member of the IAOC.  At the discretion of that individual and
   recognizing ISOC's historical role in holding and management of IETF
   resources, a different person may be designated to serve as Trustee
   of the IETF Trust or to act in that role when the ISOC President/CEO
   is unavailable.  Any such designee or alternate serves at the
   pleasure of the ISOC President/ CEO.

2.6.  IETF Administrative Director

   The IETF Administrative Director continues, unchanged, as an ex-
   officio non-voting member of both the IAOC and IETF Trust.


3.  Transition

   Members of the IAOC who were appointed by the IESG, IAB, NomCom, or
   ISOC Board of Trustees as provided for in RFC 4071 shall continue in
   both roles until the ends of their current terms.  If they find the
   dual roles burdensome relative to their available time and other
   commitments, they may resign from one, with the vacancy being filled
   as specified by RFC 4071 or the procedures of the appointing body.

   The IETF and IAB Chairs are expected to continue in their current
   roles (i.e., both the IAOC and Trustee positions, ex-officio) until
   the first IETF meeting of the calendar year after this specification
   is adopted unless the IESG or IAB choose to change the arrangements
   sooner.

   Should the ISOC President/CEO choose to appoint a designee or
   alternate to act as Trustee of the IETF Trust, that appointment may
   be made at any time after this specification is adopted.

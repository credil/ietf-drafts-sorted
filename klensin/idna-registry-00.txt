                  draft-klensin-idna-registry-00.txt

Abstract

   As part of the IDNA package, the IANA Considerations Section of RFC
   5892 specified an "IDNA Derived Properties" registry.  Experience
   with that specification demonstrated it to be insufficiently clear on
   several details.  This document respecifies that registry to
   eliminate any confusion.

Internet-Draft          IDNA IANA Considerations               June 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Reasons for this Specification

   As part of the IDNA package [RFC5890], the IANA Considerations
   Section of RFC 5892 [RFC5892] specified an "IDNA Derived Properties"
   registry.  Experience with that specification demonstrated it to be
   insufficiently clear on several details.  This document respecifies
   that registry to eliminate any confusion.  In particular,
   clarifications are required for the following:

   Preservation of tables
      The registry actually consists of one table per Unicode version
      starting with the Unicode 5.2 table that was included in RFC 5892.

   Identification of tables
      Each table in the registry will be identified with a reference to
      the particular Unicode version from which it was generated and the
      date on which it was installed.

   Timing and Mechanism for Generating Tables
      The text in RFC 5982 is not clear about who is responsible for
      generating tables and when new tables are to be installed and this
      requires clarification.


2.  Explanation of the Updating Model

   [[RFC Editor, please remove this section -- Note in Draft only]]

   As of the time of posting the first draft of this document, there had
   been no real discussion in the community of the mechanisms and timing
   for getting new versions posted.  The suggestion made below is very
   tentative and intended to encourage discussion.  It tries to preserve
   the intent and discussions leading up to RFC 5892 to the extent
   possible by putting the burden of deciding when new table versions
   are appropriate on the expert reviewer.  Itj also makes IANA
   responsible for the actual work of producing and installing new
   tables, but identifies mechanisms by which they can get help with
   tables and with identifying the existence of new versions of Unicode
   as needed.

   The procedure outlined below delays any posting of a table by IANA
   until either (i) the expert reviews signs off that no changes to RFC
   5892 rules are needed or (ii) IESG, after being notified by the
   expert reviewer that there is a problem, figures out how to handle
   things in terms of documentation and community consensus, and
   approves the result.  If the community would prefer posting of a

   table for comparison or checking purposes as soon as possible after a
   new Unicode version is completed, it would be possible to devise a
   model for "Preliminary" (just after Unicode gets through) and "Final"
   (after IETF is sure it is through) versions of a table with
   procedures for getting from one to the other..


3.  Specific Updates to RFC 5892

   The following subsections are added to the specification of RFC 5892
   Section 5.1 "IDNA-Derived Property Value Registry".  The numbers in
   parentheses are the subsection numbers the paragraphs would have if
   actually inserted in RFC 8582.

   (5.1.1)   The registry consists of a set of tables, one table per
             version of Unicode starting with Unicode 5.2 and continuing
             with each new version of Unicode as specified below.

   (5.1.2)   Each table in the registry shall be identified with the
             Unicode version, a reference to the specification of that
             version, and the date the table was last updated.

   (5.1.3)   As soon as feasible after a new version of Unicode is
             finalized and published, IANA or the expert reviewer (as
             they mutually agree) will generate a new version of the
             table.  The expert reviewer will then conduct a review.  If
             issues are found, they are brought to IESG attention as
             discussed in RFC 5892.  If not, the expert reviewer will
             advise IANA to install the new table version in the
             registry, identifying it as described above.

             Members of the community are encouraged to call new
             versions of Unicode to the attention of IANA and the expert
             reviewer.  IANA is encouraged to call on the expert
             reviewer or others for assistance in compiling and
             verifying Preliminary tables as needed.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies the management, content, and organization of
   an IANA registry.  It does not introduce any security issues not
   already covered in RFC 5890 and 5892.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document is a specification of the requirements for an IANA

   registry.  Details appear in Section 3.

   This specification was motivated by issues with the clarity of the
   RFC 5892 "IANA Considerations" section identified by Roni Even, Paul
   Hoffman, Russ Housley, and others.

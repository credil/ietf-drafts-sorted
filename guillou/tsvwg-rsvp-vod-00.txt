Internet-Draft                RSVP for VoD                    March 2010


1.  Introduction

   SFR is the second largest telecommunications operator in France,
   operating both a mobile and a wireline network.  In particular, 4
   millions homes are attached to the broadband residential service.
   The broadband service portfolio includes a triple play service
   (Internet, Video/TV, telephony) with free and paying Video on Demand
   (VoD) services.

   Section 2 summarizes SFR resource control requirements associated
   with the delivery of these VoD services.  Section 3 describes the
   approach based on RSVP for addressing those requirements.

   Finally, Section 4 recommends that the IETF continues maintenance and
   extension of RSVP so that the industry can continue benefiting from
   quality interoperable resource control solutions based on RSVP.

   This document is provided as an input to the IETF 77 RSVP-mini-BOF
   and more generally to the IETF decision process regarding RSVP
   standardisation.

2.  Resource Control Requirements For A Triple Play Video On Demand
    Service

   Video and streaming traffic is growing continuously in a service
   provider network.  The corresponding bandwidth needed in the network
   will increase more and more because of two different factors:

   o  The number of subscribers will increase because of the free Video
      on Demand (VoD) and the broader offering in terms of paying VoD

   o  The bandwidth of the individual streams will increase because of
      High Definition (HD) and maybe the 3D in the future.

   We can divide the network in three parts: the backbone, the
   aggregation ring and the access (DSLAM for example).

   To control the maximum video load on the backbone, the best way is to
   open more VoD POPs to be able to stream the flow closer to the
   customer.

   On the aggregation ring, to support network outage, we will make some
   over-provisioning on most of the access, but it will not be possible
   everywhere.  In some cases, the cost of this over-provisioning will
   be too expensive.  Also, on the aggregation equipment, it will not
   always be possible to increase the bandwidth at will because of the
   equipment limitation.  With the diffserv model, we have two problems.
   If we put very high priority for the VoD traffic, in case of
   saturation of a link (network outage, video surge due to a big event)
   the VoD traffic could hog most, or all, of the bandwidth and make the
   internet access totally unusable.  On the other hand, if we put less
   priority for the VoD stream, in the same situation, VoD quality will
   not be enough for our customers and Internet access will still be
   unusable.  We do have an interest for RSVP on the aggregation ring
   and on the IP edge to solve this problem.  We will use RSVP to put a
   limitation on the number of simultaneous VoD streams to always have
   good quality and still keep an acceptable internet access.  RSVP will
   protect the quality of established VoD sessions and of the less
   prioritised traffic by rejecting the additional excessive video
   session attempts during unpredictable peaks, during link or node
   failures, or combination of those factors.  Another point of interest
   in RSVP is to be able to use the Application ID to put different
   limitation on different kind of streams.  With this functionality, we
   could be able to put a higher limitation on free VoD to save
   bandwidth for paid VoD and, in some cases, pre-empt free VoD.

3.  RSVP Deployment Approach for VoD Admission Control

   As we describe in the previous section, we do not have to implement
   RSVP on all the nodes.  With the distribution of VoD POP they should
   not be so many VoD streams going thru the backbone links so the over-
   provisioning of the backbone will be enough to support peaks and
   network outage.  All that we want the backbones router to do is to
   let the RSVP messages going thru transparently with no processing
   (other than regular IP-based forwarding).

   On the aggregation nodes, RSVP will be processed and reservations
   should be done as described in[RFC2205].  RSVP is normally an end to
   end reservation protocol, but allowing RSVP message to/from the end-
   user raises some security problems.  An effective way to protect the
   network from an RSVP attack is to deny every RSVP messages from the
   outside of the network.  The RSVP receiver proxy functionality
   ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-approaches],
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-proxy-proto]) is in this case the best way to
   use RSVP without allow our customers to be part of the RSVP cloud.

   In this model, we need to couple the RSVP reservation and the
   corresponding RTSP stream.  The best equipment to do so is the VoD
   Pump.

Internet-Draft                RSVP for VoD                    March 2010


   VoD service is operational in SFR (without RSVP) since 2007.  The
   RSVP solution is being validated and deployment strategies are being
   defined.

   While part of the aggregation nodes are capable of supporting RSVP
   and RSVP Receiver Proxy, some nodes are not.  This forces us to
   consider the network in two different part:

   o  the RSVP-capable aggregation network: It will have a RSVP proxy
      and then will be protected by RSVP admission control.

   o  The non-RSVP-capable aggregation network.  It will not have RSVP
      proxy and will not be protected by admission control

   The implementation of the coupling between RSVP and RTSP on the VoD
   streamer has to take care of this two topologies: we have to allow
   the streamer to send his RTSP flow even if RSVP reservation is not
   fully reserved on the path.  Here is how VoD streamers will made the
   link between RSVP and RTSP :

   o  When the streamer receive an RTSP SETUP, it will start the RTSP
      streaming and send his RSVP PATH message

   o  If the streamer receives an RSVP RESV message, it means that the
      path is protect by RSVP and the streamer keep its RTSP stream and
      its RSVP context

   o  If the RSVP timer expired, it means that the path is not is
      protected by RSVP so the streamer tear down its RSVP context but
      keep its RTSP session

   o  If the streamer receives an RSVP ERROR message, it means that path
      is protected by RSVP but there is not enough bandwidth so the
      streamer tears down its RSVP session and its RTSP session.

   This kind of behavior of the RSVP streamer also allows us to deploy
   RSVP on the network step by step with no impact on the customer
   quality.

4.  Recommendation

   SFR will deploy the RSVP admission control to protect the VoD streams
   of its residential broadband customers.  Therefore, it will be
   beneficial to SFR if the IETF keeps working on open RSVP-based
   solutions benefiting from different industry experts to unsure good
   interoperability between different vendors.

5.  Security Considerations

   As explained in Section 3, opening our control plane to an on-path
   admission control protocol raises some security concerns.  Without
   proper security measures, we can not control that a reservation is
   really made for a VoD flow, and we expose ourselves to an attack on
   our control plane.  To solve this problem, we will filter all RSVP
   messages from untrusted network (peering, transit, customer) and rely
   on RSVP receiver proxy on the interface facing the DSLAM and the
   customers that need RSVP protected VoD flows.  On each router where
   RSVP is enabled, we will also activate pacing and rate limiting of
   RSVP messages to protect the CPU of the node.

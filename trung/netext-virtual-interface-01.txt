   technology handover requires the new interface to use the same
   network prefix with the old one and all the IP address/prefix at the
   old interface are removed.  These requirements disable multihoming
   function which requires different network prefixes for different
   interfaces.  In this Internet draft we address this problem and
   suggest the necessary changes in PMIPv6 operations to support a
   mobile node to perform multihoming as well as seamless inter
   technology handover with virtual interface.

Internet-Draft          PMIPv6 Virtual Interface            October 2009


1.  Introduction

   In the real system, a mobile node can connect to the network by using
   multiple interfaces with different access technologies such as WiFi,
   CDMA.  At the same time it can perform multiple connections for
   multiple services such as video, voice, or just chatting.  As time
   goes by, due to the changing of network status or other reasons, it
   may want to perform partial handoff [4].  Some connections are moved
   to a new interface, while the other ones keep using the current
   interface.  The draft [5] describes the minimum requirements on the
   mobile node for handovers across interfaces using Proxy Mobile IPv6
   [1].  First, the mobile node removes the IP address/prefix from the
   old interface.  Second, it sets the same IP address/prefix on the new
   interface.  Finally, it updates active socket structures to the new
   interface.  When removing an IP address from an interface, its link-
   layer connection is torn down, leading to the removal of the entire
   auto configured IP addresses/prefixes of the old interface.  In
   addition, at local mobility anchor, all of the home network prefixes
   associated with the old interface will be associated with a new one.
   These practices can terminate all other connections using the old
   interface and disable the multihoming function.

   The Internet draft [4] outlines extensions to PMIPv6 protocol in
   order to support a multiple interfaced mobile node to achieve such
   partial vertical handoff of selected prefixes.  In their solution,
   the multihoming sessions are protected while moving some flows from
   an interface to another.  However it requires the application
   sessions at a mobile node to be aware of the interface changing.  In
   addition the local mobility anchor also has to track the interface
   changing of each connection at the mobile node.  These limitations
   may threat the survivability of sessions across handovers.

   The virtual interface is a well known technique [6].  It can help us
   to hide all the changing of physical interfaces from application
   sessions and perform seamless inter technology handover without any
   interruption of multihoming sessions.  However there are few
   documents that discuss about how to support virtual interface in
   PMIPv6.  In this Internet draft we suggest the necessary changes in
   PMIPv6 operations to support the mobile nodes to perform multihoming
   as well as seamless inter technology handover with virtual interface.


2.  Inter technology handover and multihoming scenario

   The draft [5] discusses about the multiple interfaces scenarios in
   detail.  In this draft we consider a scenario that can support
   multiple access technologies using multiple mobile access gateways.
   A local mobility anchor is used to manage the mobility of all the

   mobile nodes.  A multiple local mobility anchors scenario is out of
   the scope of this draft.  Each mobile node in the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain can be equipped with more than one interface using different
   technologies such as WiFi, HSDP or CDMA.  At the same time, the
   mobile node can connect to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain using
   multiple interfaces simultaneously, called multihoming support.  When
   moving across the mobile access gateways, or when suffering from the
   instability of network status, the mobile node can move some flows
   from an interface to others, called inter technology/interfaces
   handover.  Figure 1 shows a use case that is considered in this
   draft.

3.  Virtual interface support at mobile node

   Most of the current systems, such as Linux, MAC-OS or Windows, offer
   support to create a virtual interface over multiple physical
   interfaces.  The virtual interface represents for all other physical
   interfaces and provides a single IP link for the upper layers.  All
   of the changes of physical interfaces are transparent to the upper
   layers.  Meanwhile the physical interfaces are limited to any global
   IP addresses, they have only link-local addresses.  The applications

   only recognize the global IP address of the virtual interface.
   Figure 2 shows an example of a virtual interface architecture
   implemented at a mobile node.  The detailed configuration parameters
   are showed in the table 1.  We can see in this example that only the
   virtual interface is assigned a global IP address, 2009:1234:5678:

         Figure 2: The virtual interface support at a mobile node

   There are several ways for setting a virtual interface at a mobile
   node.  The detailed discussion of setting procedures is out of the
   scope of this draft.  For further information we can refer to NET:
   BRIDGE [7] or Interface bonding [8].

4.  PMIPv6 operations with the supporting of virtual interface at mobile
    node

   Since the mobile node uses a virtual interface, from the layer 3
   point of view, all of the links of multiple interfaces are hidden
   under a single IP link.  As a result, the mobile node is offered a
   capability to hide interface changes due to handovers so as to
   preserve the same home network prefix in use.

   When the mapping between the virtual interface and the multiple
   interfaces is available, the mobile node can connect to Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 domain by using multiple links simultaneously.  All of these
   links will use the same home network prefix of the virtual interface.

   However, when all of the links share the same home network prefix,
   the local mobility anchor should be able to identify the flows that
   need to be forwarded to corresponding interfaces.

   For PMIPv6 to work with the mobile node using virtual interface, we
   suggest to extend the signaling between the mobile access gateway and
   the local mobility anchor, as well as to modify the control logic at
   local mobility anchor.

   The mobile access gateway should include the flow information in the
   Proxy Binding Update sent to the local mobility anchor.  To get the
   flow information, the mobile access gateway can collect information
   about the service identifier at layer 2 when a mobile node attach to
   it.  We can refer to the draft [9] for more detail about the service
   identifier.  The mobile access gateway can inform the flow
   information to the local mobility anchor by using the Service
   Selection option in the Proxy Binding Update as discussed in [2].

   When receiving the Proxy Binding Update message from the mobile
   access gateway, the local mobility anchor checks the flow information
   and creates or updates the flow filters.  The flow filters then may
   be stored in the binding cache entry for the mobile node.

   The figure 3 shows an example of use case with address configuration
   of using virtual interface at the mobile node.  The virtual interface
   of the mobile node is assigned to the same network prefix with the
   access interface of the mobile access gateway 1 and 2 (MAGA1, MAGA2).
   The detail address configuration is showed in the table 2.  Note that
   only the virtual interface, VIF, of the mobile node is assigned a
   global IP address, all of the physical interfaces, such as IF1 and
   IF2, are not assigned any global IP address.  They have only link-
   local address as showed in the table 1.

5.  Conclusion

   Supporting both multihoming and inter technology handoff using PMIPv6
   is challenge since no mobile node involvement is allowed.  Modifying
   the mobile node is also limited.  In this draft we introduce a
   solution that can support and solve the problems of both multihoming
   and inter technology handoff by using virtual interface at the mobile
   node.  The key advantage of virtual interface architecture is that it
   can hide all the changing of physical interface from upper layers.
   From that the mobile node can performs seamless handoff between

   interfaces without any session loss.  The mobile node can also
   perform multihoming when the mapping between virtual interface and
   multiple physical interfaces is available.

   In the future work we will discuss more detail about several
   technical requirements in section 4.

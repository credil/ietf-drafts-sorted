Internet-Draft  RADIUS Extensions for NAT Forwarding Port February 2011

Abstract

   This memo proposes two new RADIUS attributes with each to carry
   an Internal Port number and a Configured External Port number,
   both are associated with a specific NAT device and a specific user,
   and are configured on a RADIUS server such that when the user
   requests an Internet connection, the port mapping information can
   be conveyed to NAS that co-locates with the NAT device via RADIUS
   protocol, and is used during the NAT operation for IP flows to and
   from that user. The two attributes also include an IPv4 address or
   IPv6 address, respectively, as the pinhole internal IP address at
   the NAT device.

1. Introduction

   In most of the scenarios, the port mapping on a NAT device is
   dynamically created when the IP packets of an IP connection
   initiated by a user arrives. For some applications, the port
   mapping needs to be pre-defined allowing IP packets of
   applications from outside a NAT device to pass through and
   "port forwarded" to the correct user located behind the NAT
   device.

   Port Control Protocol or PCP ([I-D.draft-ietf-pcp-base]),
   provides a mechanism to create pinholes from an external IP
   address to an internal IP address and port on a NAT device
   just to achieve the "port forwarding" purpose. PCP is a
   server-client protocol capable of creating or deleting a pinhole
   along with a rich set of features on a NAT device in dynamic
   fashion. In some deployment, all users need is a few, typically
   just one pre-configured port mapping for applications such

   as web cam at home, and the lifetime of such a port mapping
   remains valid throughout the duration of the customer's Internet
   service connection time. In such an environment, it is possible
   to statically configure a port mapping on the RADIUS server for
   a user and let the RADIUS protocol to propagate the information
   to the associated NAT device.

   In a broadband network, customer information is usually stored
   on a RADIUS server and at the time when a user initiates an
   Internet service request, the RADIUS server will populate
   the user's configuration information to the NAS, which is
   usually co-located with the BNG, after the connection
   request is granted. In many cases, the NAT function is also on
   the BNG, and therefore the port forwarding information can be
   configured on the RADIUS server as part of the user profile.

   This memo proposes two new RADIUS attributes to carry Internal
   Port number and Configured External Port number, both are associated
   with a specific NAT device and a specific user, with an IPv4
   address or IPv6 address as the pinhole internal address,
   respectively, and are configured on a RADIUS server such that
   when the user requests an Internet connection, the port mapping
   information can be conveyed to the NAS that co-locates with the
   NAT device via RADIUS protocol, and is used during the NAT operation
   for IP flows to and from that user.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Operation

   Port mapping information for NAT for a user (e.g., a CPE or host)
   is configured on a RADIUS server, along with other user information
   such as credentials. The port mapping information that is to be
   used during the NAT procedure is going to be populated from
   the RADIUS server to the NAT device using RADIUS protocol.

   In Figure-1, a Network Access Server (NAS), co-located with a NAT
   device on a BNG, operates as a RADIUS client. The NAT device that
   resides on the BNG performs a single NAT (or firewall) function
   such as NAT44, NAT64, etc.

   When the user sends a service request, the NAS on the BNG sends
   a RADIUS Access-Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting

   authentication. Once the RADIUS server receives the request, it
   validates the sending client and if the request is approved, the
   RADIUS server replies with an Access-Accept message including a
   list of attribute-value pairs that describe the parameters to be
   used for this connection, including the port forwarding mapping
   specifically configured for the user.

   When the RADIUS Access-Accept message arrived at the BNG, the
   port mapping information is used to create a pinhole on the NAT,
   along with the associated pinhole internal IP address, and also the
   external IP address, when it becomes available, for the specific
   user. A service granted message is then sent to the user, and after
   that point, IP packets from application initiated from network side
   (e.g., web cam) can be "port forwarded" by the NAT on the BNG to
   the user that is behind the NAT. IP packets belonging to the same
   flow but on opposite direction also traverse the same pinhole.

Internet-Draft  RADIUS Extensions for NAT Forwarding Port February 2011

   When an IP packet travels from behind the NAT outwards (outbound),
   the NAT must change the source port number, i.e., the internal port
   to the configured external port, and when an IP packet travels from
   outside to the inside of the NAT (inbound), the NAT must change the
   target port number, i.e., the configured external port to the
   internal port.

   Note that the service request that is initiated by a user can be
   associated with a PPP session or relevant DHCPv4/DHCPv6 message,
   with the same communication sequence between the RADIUS server and
   the NAS, and the installation of the port mapping on the NAT. Also,
   there may be different mechanisms as how an internal IP address and
   an external IP address (in the context of the NAT) assigned
   or determined, respectively, on the NAT for a specific user, but the
   forwarding port mapping information will remain the same as
   configured on the RADIUS server and is bonded to the specific user
   with one of its specific IP address.

   A port mapping, once created on the NAT, will remain permanently
   in the duration of the user's Internet connection. When the
   connection is torn down, the mapping on the NAT must then be
   removed accordingly.

   In the NAT444 scenario, in order to allow an IPv4 packet generated
   from outside of the BNG reaching the user, a forwarding port mapping
   is required on the NAT residing on the BNG as described above, but
   a separate forwarding port mapping is required on the user, typically
   a CPE, and in addition, the two sets of mapping need to be
   coordinated, so that an inbound IP packet, i.e., from outside of the
   BNG destined to the user, will successfully traverse two NATs before
   arriving at the user. The required mechanism for the NAT444 case is
   out of the scope of this document.

4. RADIUS Attributes

   Two new RADIUS attributes are defined in this document, for IPv4
   address and IPv6 address as the NAT pinhole internal address,
   respectively.

   NAT-IPv4-Forwarding-Port-Map Attribute  (Figure-2)
   NAT-IPv6-Forwarding-Port-Map Attribute  (Figure-3)

   Description

   Both of the two attributes contain a 16-bit Internal Port that
   identifies the source TCP/UDP port number of an IP packet sent
   by the user, or the destination port number of an IP packet destined

   to the user, and in both cases, the IP packet travels behind the
   NAT device. Also they contain a 16-bit Configured External Port that
   identifies the source TCP/UDP port number of an IP packet sent
   by the user, or the destination port number of an IP packet
   destined to the user, and in both cases, the IP packet travels
   outside of the NAT device. In addition, the two attributes contain
   a 32-bit IPv4 address or 128-bit IPv6 address, respectively, as
   their respective NAT pinhole's internal IP address. Together, the
   port pair and IP address determine the port mapping rule for a
   specific IP flow that traverses a NAT device.

   The attribute MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet, and may also
   appear in an Accounting-Request packet. In either case, the attribute
   MUST NOT appear more than once in a single packet.

   Neither of these attributes MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packets.

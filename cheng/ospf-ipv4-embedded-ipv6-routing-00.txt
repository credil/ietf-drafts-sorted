Internet-Draft         IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Routing            June 2010

1. Introduction

   This document describes a routing scenario where IPv4 packets are
   transported over IPv6 backbone.

1.1. The scenario

   Due to exhaustion of public IPv4 addresses, there has been
   continuing effort within IETF on IPv6 transitional techniques. In
   the course of transition, it is certain that networks based on IPv4
   and IPv6, respectively, will co-exist at least for some time. One
   scenario of the co-existence is that IPv4-only networks inter-
   connecting with IPv6-only networks, and in particular, when an IPv6-
   only network serves as a transit network that inter-connects several
   segregated IPv4-only networks. In this scenario, IPv4 packets are
   transported over the IPv6 transit network between IPv4 networks. In
   order to forward an IPv4 packet from a source IPv4 network to the
   destination IPv4 network, IPv4 reachability information must be
   exchanged among involved networks by some means.

1.2. Routing Solution by RFC5565

   In fact, the scenario above is well described in [RFC5565], i.e.-
   IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario, where the network core is IPv6-only, and
   the inter-connected IPv4 networks are called IPv4 client networks.
   The P routers in the core only support IPv6 but the AFBRs support
   IPv4 on interface facing IPv4 client networks, and IPv6 on interface
   facing the core. The routing solution defined in [RFC5565] for this
   scenario is to run i-BGP among AFBRs to exchange IPv4 routing
   information with each other, and the IPv4 packets are forwarded from
   one IPv4 client network to the other through a softwire using
   tunneling technology such as MPLS LSP, GRE, L2TPv3, etc.

   Some of the terms that are used in [RFC5565] are used in this
   document and they include AFBR, IPv4 client networks, IPv6 transit
   network, etc.

1.3. An Alternative Routing Solution with OSPFv3

   In this document, we propose an alternative routing solution for
   this scenario. Since the scenario occurs most in a single ISP
   operating environment, an IPv6 prefix can be locally allocated and
   used to construct IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses according to [I-
   D.ietf-behave-address-format] by each AFBR, where the embedded IPv4
   addresses are associated with an IPv4 client network that is
   connected to the AFBR, and each IPv4 address is an individual IPv4
   address or prefix. An AFBR injects IPv4-Embedded IPv6

   addresses/prefixes into the IPv6 transit network using OSPFv3 and
   also installs those advertised by other AFBRs. When an IPv4 packet
   is sent from one IPv4 client network to the other, it is first
   encapsulated with an IPv6 header, where the source and destination
   IPv6 address are constructed, in a stateless manner, as IPv4-
   Embedded IPv6 address, respectively, and then forwarded to the
   destination AFBR that is the advertising router of the destination
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address. The destination AFBR replaces the IPv6
   header by the corresponding IPv4 header, where the source and
   destination IPv4 addresses are derived from the IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   source and destination addresses, respectively, and then forwards
   the IPv4 packet using its IPv4 routing table in the attached IPv4
   client network.

   There are use cases where the proposed routing solution is useful.
   One case is that some AFBRs do not participate i-BGP for routes
   exchange (one example is documented in [I-D.boucadair-dslite-
   interco-v4v6]), or i-BGP is not used at all. Another case is that
   tunnel mechanism is not used in the IPv6 transit network, or native
   IPv6 forwarding is preferred. Note also that with this routing
   solution, the IPv4-IPv6 inter-connection and associated header
   translation that occurs at an AFBR is stateless.

1.4. OSPFv3 Routing with a Specific Topology

   Routing IPv4-Embedded IPv6 packets in the IPv6 transit network using
   OSPFv3, in general, may be performed by the OSPFv3 operation that is
   already running in the IPv6 network. One concern however, is that
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routes would flood throughout the entire transit
   network and stored on every router, which may not be desirable. Also,
   since all IPv6 routes are stored in the same routing table, it might
   be more difficult to manage the resource required for routing and
   forwarding based on traffic category, if so desired. To solve this
   problem, a separate OSPFv3 routing table can be constructed that is
   dedicated to IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology, and that table is solely
   used for routing IPv4-Embedded IPv6 packets (i.e., IPv4 part of the
   Internet) in the transit network. Further, only a set of routers in
   the transit network are required to be involved in such routing
   scheme, including AFBRs that connect to IPv4 client networks along
   with a set of P routers in the core for routing path.

   There are two methods to build a separate OSPFv3 routing table for
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing.

   - The first one is to run a separate OSPFv3 instance for IPv4-
      Embedded IPv6 topology in the IPv6 transit network according to
      [RFC5838],



Cheng, et al.         Expires December 21, 2010               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Routing            June 2010

   - The second one is to stay with the existing OSPFv3 instance that
      already operates in the transit network, but maintain a separate
      IPv4-Embedded topology, according to [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3].

   With both methods, there would be a dedicated IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   topology that is maintained by OSPFv3 speakers and thus a dedicated
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing table, which is then used for routing
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 packets (i.e., packets destined to an IPv4
   destination). It would be operators' preference as which method is
   going to be used and in this document. This document elaborates on
   how configuration is done for each method and related routing issues
   that is common to both.

   This document only focuses on unicast routing for IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   packets using OSPFv3.

2. Provisioning

2.1. Deciding the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Topology

   Before making appropriate configuration in order to generate a
   separate OSPFv3 routing table for IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   addresses/prefixes, decision must be made on the set of routers and
   their interfaces in the IPv6 transit network that should be on the
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology.

   For the purpose of this topology, all AFBRs that connect to IPv4
   client networks should be members of this topology, and also at
   least some of their network core facing interfaces, which depends on
   which P routers in the IPv6 transit network would be on this
   topology.

   The IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology is a sub-topology of the entire IPv6
   transit network, and if all routers (including AFBRs and P-routers)
   and their interfaces are included, the two topologies converge. In
   general, as more P routers and their interfaces are configured on
   this sub-topology, it would increase the inter-connectivity and
   potentially, there would be more routing paths cross the transit
   network from one IPv4 client network to the other, at the cost that
   more routers need to participate the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing. In
   any case, the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology must be continuous with no
   partitions.

2.2. Maintaining a Dedicated IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Routing Table

   In an IPv6 transit network, in order to maintain a separate IPv6
   routing table that contains routes for IPv4-Embedded IPv6

   destinations only, OSPFv3 needs to use the mechanism defined either
   in [RFC5838] or [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] with required
   configuration tasks, as described in the following sub-sections.

2.3. Maintaining a Dedicated IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Routing Table

   It is assumed that the scenario as described in this document is
   under a single ISP and as such, an OSPFv3 instance ID (IID) is
   allocated locally and used for an OSPFv3 operation dedicated to
   unicast IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing in an IPv6 transit network. This
   IID is configured on each OSPFv3 interface of routers that
   participates in this routing instance.

   The range for a locally configured OSPFv3 IID is from 128 to 255,
   inclusively, and this number must be used to encode the "Instance
   ID" field in the OSPFv3 packet header on every router that executes
   this instance in the IPv6 transit network.

   In addition, the "AF" bit in the OSPFv3 Option field must be set.

   During the Hello packets processing, adjacency may only be
   established when received Hello packets contain the Instance ID as
   also configured on the receiving interface for OSPFv3 instance
   dedicated to the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing.

   More details are referred to [RFC5838].

2.4. OSPFv3 Topology with the Default Instance

   Similar to that as described in the previous section, an OSPFv3
   multi-topology ID (MT-ID) is locally allocated and used for an
   OSPFv3 operation including unicast IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing in an
   IPv6 transit network. This MTID is configured on each OSPFv3
   interface of routers that participates in this routing topology.

   The range for a locally configured OSPFv3 MT-ID is from 32 to 255,
   inclusively, and this number must be used to encode the "MT-ID"
   field that is included in some of the extended LSAs as documented in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3].

   In addition, the "MT" bit in the OSPFv3 Option field must be set.

   More details are referred to [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3].

3. IP Header Translation

   When transporting IPv4 packets across an IPv6 transit network with
   the mechanism described above, the IPv4 header is replaced by an
   IPv6 header at an ingress AFBR and restored at an exit AFBR. The IP
   header translation is accomplished in stateless manner according to
   rules specified in [I-D.draft-ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate], with the
   address translation detail explained in the next sub-section.

3.1. Address Translation

   Prior to the operation, an IPv6 prefix is allocated by the ISP and
   it is used to form an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address.

   The IPv6 prefix can either be a well-known IPv6 prefix (WKP)
   64:FF9B::/96, or a network-specific prefix that is unique to the
   ISP, and for the later case, the IPv6 prefix length may be 32, 40,
   48, 56 or 64. In either case, this IPv6 prefix is used during the
   address translation between an IPv4 address and an IPv4-Embedded
   IPv6 address, which is performed according to [I-D.ietf-behave-
   address-format].

   During translation from an IPv4 header to an IPv6 header at an
   ingress AFBR, the source IPv4 address and destination IPv4 address
   are translated into the corresponding IPv6 source address and
   destination IPv6 address, respectively, and during translation from
   an IPv6 header to an IPv4 header at an exit AFBR, the source IPv6
   address and destination IPv6 address are translated into the
   corresponding IPv4 source address and destination IPv4 address,
   respectively. Note that the address translation is accomplished in a
   stateless manner.

4. Advertising IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Routes

   In order to forward IPv4 packets to the proper destination across
   IPv6 transit network, IPv4 reachability needs to be disseminated
   throughout the IPv6 transit network and this work is performed by
   AFBRs that connect to IPv4 client networks using OSPFv3.

   With the scenario described in this document, i.e.- a set of AFBRs
   that inter-connect a bunch of IPv4 client networks with an IPv6
   transit network, we view that IPv4 networks and IPv6 networks belong
   to separate Autonomous Systems, and as such, these AFBRs are OSPFv3
   ASBRs.

Internet-Draft         IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Routing            June 2010

4.1. Advertising IPv4-Embedded Ipv6 Routes into IPv6 Transit Network

   IPv4 addresses and prefixes in an IPv4 client network are translated
   into IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes, respectively, using
   the same IPv6 prefix allocated by the ISP and the method specified
   in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format], and then advertised by one or
   more attached ASBRs into the IPv6 transit network using AS External
   LSA ([RFC5340]), i.e.- with the advertising scope throughout the
   entire Autonomous System.

4.1.1. Routing Metrics

   By default, the metric in an AS External LSA that carries an IPv4-
   Embedded IPv6 address or prefixes is a Type 1 external metric, which
   is then to be added to the metric of an intra-AS path during OSPFv3
   routes calculation. By configuration on an ASBR, the metric can be
   set to a Type 2 external metric, which is considered much larger
   than any intra-AS path. The detail is referred to OSPFv3
   specification ([RFC5340]). In either case, an external metric may be
   exact the same unit as in an IPv4 network (running OSPFv2 or
   others), but may also be specified by a routing policy, the detail
   is outside of the scope of this document.

4.1.2. Forwarding Address

   If the "Forwarding Address" field of an OSPFv3 AS External LSA is
   used to carry an IPv6 address, that must also be an IPv4-Embedded
   IPv6 address where the embedded IPv4 address is the actual address
   in an IPv4 client network to which, data traffic is forwarded to.
   [Editors note - this is stated differently as in Section 2.6 of
   RFC5838; this is for consistence of the encoding rule on all IPv4-
   Embedded IPv6 addresses/prefixes. Is that an issue here?]

4.2. Advertising IPv4 Addresses into Client Networks

   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routes injected into the IPv6 transit network
   from one IPv4 client network may be advertised into another IPv4
   client network, after the associated destination addresses/prefixes
   are translated back to IPv4 addresses/prefixes format. This
   operation is similar to the regular OSPFv3 operation, wherein an AS
   External LSA can be advertised in a non-backbone area by default.

   An IPv4 client network that does not want to receive such
   advertisement can be configured as a stub area or with other routing
   policy.

Internet-Draft         IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Routing            June 2010

   For the purpose of this document, IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routes must not
   advertised into any IPv6 client networks that also connected to the
   IPv6 transit network.

5. Aggregation on IPv4 Addresses and Prefixes

   In order to reduce the amount of AS External LSAs that are injected
   to the IPv6 transit network, effort must be made to aggregate IPv4
   addresses and prefixes at each AFBR before advertising.

6. Forwarding

   There are three cases in forwarding IP packets in the scenario as
   described in this document, as follows:

   1) On an AFBR, if an IPv4 packet that is received on an interface
      connecting to an IPv4 client network with the destination IPv4
      address belong to another IPv4 client network, the header of the
      packet is translated to a corresponding IPv6 header as described
      in Section 3, and the packet is then forwarded to the destination
      AFBR that advertises the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address through the
      IPv6 transit network.


   2) On an AFBR, if an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 packet is received and the
      embedded destination IPv4 address is in its IPv4 routing table,
      the header of the packet is translated to a corresponding IPv4
      header as described in Section 3, and the packet is then
      forwarded accordingly.


   3) On any router that is within the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology
      located in the IPv6 transit network, if an IPv4-Embedded IPv6
      packet is received and a route is found in the IPv4-Embedded IPv6
      routing table, the packet is forwarded accordingly.


   The classification of IPv4-Embedded IPv6 packet is according to the
   IPv6 prefix of the destination address, which is either a WKP (i.e.,
   64:FF9B::/96) or locally allocated as defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-
   address-format].

7. MTU Issue

   In the IPv6 transit network, there is no new MTU issue introduced by
   this document. If a separate OSPFv3 instance (per [RFC5838]) is used
   for IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing, the MTU handling in the transit
   network is the same as that of the default OSPFv3 instance. If a
   separate OSPFv3 topology (per [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3]) is used for
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing, the MTU handling in the transit network
   is the same as that of the default OSPFv3 topology.

   However, the MTU in the IPv6 transit network may be different than
   that of IPv4 client networks. Since an IPv6 router will never
   fragment a packet, the packet size of any IPv4-Embedded IPv6 packet
   entering the IPv6 transit network must be equal to or smaller than
   the MTU of the IPv6 transit network. In order to achieve this
   requirement, it is recommended that AFBRs to perform IPv6 path
   discovery among themselves and the resulting MTU, after taking into
   account of the difference between IPv4 header length and IPv6 header
   length, must be "propagated" into IPv4 client networks, e.g.-
   included in the OSPFv3 Database Description packet.

   The detail of passing the proper MTU into IPv4 client networks is
   beyond the scope of this document.

8. "Backdoor" Connections

   In some deployments, there may exist direct connections among IPv4
   client networks themselves in addition to the IPv6 transit network,
   as "backdoor" connections referring to, where IPv4 packets can
   either be transported between those IPv4 client networks via
   backdoor connections, or through the IPv6 transit network. In
   general, routing policies should be as such that the "backdoor" path
   is preferred since the transportation is within a single address
   family without the need for IP header translation, among other
   things.

           Home Agent Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6
                 draft-xia-mext-ha-init-flow-binding-03

Abstract

   There are scenarios in which home agent initiated flow binding
   operations towards the mobile node is needed such as revoking a flow
   binding or moving a flow from one interface to another because of
   network resource availability.  This document defines one new
   Mobility Header, two messages, several actions and two new sub-
   options to perform home agent initiated interactions for flow
   bindings in a mobile node.  Home agent initiated flow bindings are
   supported for both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled mobile nodes.

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      June 2010


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] allows a mobile node to bind a
   particular flow to a care-of address without affecting other flows
   using the same home address.  Binding Update (BU)/Binding
   Acknowledgement(BA) messages are extended for the mobile node to add,
   modify, remove and refresh flow binding in a home agent.  The
   operations are always initiated by the mobile node.

   In some cases, the home agent would like to initiate flow binding
   operations. e.g, the home agent revokes a flow binding for reasons
   such as accounting insufficiency of the mobile node; for the mobile
   node equipped with multiple interfaces, the home agent moves a flow
   binding from one interface to another based on network resource
   availability; the home agent provisions default flow binding rules to
   the mobile node based on the mobile node's default profile.

   This document defines one new Mobility Header and two new messages
   for the home agent to control flow bindings in the mobile node.  Flow
   mobility for the mobile nodes with IPv4 home address and IPv4 address
   of the home agent as described in [RFC5555] is also supported.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC3775] and [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].


3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Default Flow Binding Provisioning

   Michael purchases a dual mode phone equipped with both 3GPP and WiFi
   interfaces.  He also signs a Service Level Agreement(SLA) with an
   operator including the following information:

   o  3GPP access takes priority over WiFi access when providing Voice-
      over-IP (VoIP) service.  That is, the 3GPP network is always used
      when Michael makes a call if the network is accessible.
   o  WiFi access is primarily selected to serve IPTV service.
   o  Peer-to-peer (p2p) download is only allowed through WiFi access.

   Michael's default profile can be downloaded from AAA server through

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      June 2010


   the home agent to its mobile node when registering.

3.2.  Flow Binding Revocation

   For administrative reasons, such as the utilization of CPU of a home
   agent reaches a threshold or the home agent needs to reboot some of
   it line cards, sometimes it becomes necessary to inform the mobile
   node that its flow binding has been revoked and the mobile node is no
   longer able to receive IP mobility service for a given flow.  Apart
   from revocation, the home agent may decide to delete a flow binding
   with a delete operation.

3.3.  Inter-Interface Flow Binding Movement

   Michael stays home using WLAN access for voice call and downloading.
   However, the operator does its routine maintenance of its WiFi
   devices.  The operator then moves all the calls and downloading to
   its 3GPP interface.  Once the maintenance is over, the operator then
   moves back the service.

3.4.  Exceeding traffic quota

   The 3G operator offers a mobile broadband service with a flat rate
   subscription limited to 5G Byte per month.  Once the quota is reached
   the service is downgraded to 64 K bit per second.  This limitation
   does not prevent the user from using the 3G access for mobile
   broadband services and there is no reason for the operator to change
   the policy since the service is still available.  However, since the
   operator has more information available than the user, the operator
   can indicate this to the user by sending modified flow descriptors to
   the user as a proposal to change access for an ongoing session.

   Please observe that there is no need for the HA to say which
   interface to use.  The operator may have this information, but if no
   such information is available then sending an existing flow
   descriptor excluding the BID could serve as an indication for the
   mobile node to take action and change access for a specific flow.

3.5.  Real-time off-load

   The 3G operator may want to move traffic flows from the 3G access to
   another access due to increased traffic load in the 3G access network
   and a need to ensure that bandwidth is available for prioritized
   services.  Hence, already established sessions are moved by the home
   agent by sending down an updated flow descriptor to the mobile node.

   As for the previous scenario there is no need for the HA to say which
   interface to use.

4.  Protocol Operation

   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] makes use of Binding Update (BU)
   /Binding Acknowledgement(BA) signalling to forward, i.e. register or
   discard a flow binding in a home agent.  That is, flow binding
   operations are always initiated from the mobile node.  The mechanism
   specified in this document is complimentary to the method described
   in [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].  It is assumed that the home agent
   has already created Binding Cache entries for the mobile node before
   launching flow binding operations.

   In this document, one new Mobility Header and two new messages are
   defined, that is, Flow Binding Indication (FBI) Section 5.1.1 and
   Flow Binding Acknowledgement (FBA)Section 5.1.2.  FBI is used by the
   home agent to initiate flow binding operations, while FBA is used for
   acknowledging FBI.

4.1.  Adding flow bindings

   Adding the flow binding implies associating a flow with a particular
   care-of address for the mobile node.  The care-of address concerned
   with the flow binding is present in the destination address of the
   packet or the alternate care-of address option.  Alternatively, the
   care-of address may be indicated by the Target Care-of Address sub-
   option defined in Section 5.2.3.  Binding Identification number (BID)
   described in [RFC5648] is not used in the flows initiated by the home
   agent.

   When adding a new flow binding, the home agent sends a FBI with a
   Flow Identification Mobility option to the mobile node.  The Flow
   Identification Mobility option defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] includes a unique Flow Identifier (FID).
   The Action field of the option MUST indicate an Add operation defined
   in Section 5.2.1.  The FID needs only be unique for the receiver of
   the message that adds a flow, i.e. the same FID can be used across
   different receivers of the message.  A lifetime value is included to
   indicate the remaining lifetime of the flow binding.

4.2.  Deleting flow bindings

   When removing a flow binding, the home agent node sends a FBI with a
   Flow Identification Mobility option in which Action field indicates
   Delete operation.  The Flow Identification Mobility option includes a
   unique FID for the mobile node to locate the flow binding and remove
   it.

   The trigger for the delete operation is MN sending a BU with Flow
   Identification Mobility Option that registers a new flow.  Using the

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      June 2010


   delete operation the home agent revokes the new flow registered by
   MN.

4.3.  Modifying flow bindings

   When modifying a flow binding (either the care-of address or other
   attributes of the flow), the home agent sends the mobile node a FBI
   message with Flow Identification Mobility option.  The option
   includes the FID for the binding being modified.  A Traffic Selector
   sub-option may come with the Flow Identification Mobility Option and
   contain the new attributes needed to classify the flow such as in
   [I-D.ietf-mext-binary-ts].  Hence, flow modification is essentially a
   process where an existing flow definition is removed and a new flow
   (included in the option) is added and given the same FID as the flow
   that was removed.

4.4.  Refreshing flow bindings

   A flow binding is refreshed by simply including the Flow
   Identification Mobility option with Refresh Action field in the FBI
   message.  The message should be sent before the expiration of the
   flow binding.  The message updates existing bindings with new
   information.  Hence, all information previously sent in the last
   refreshing message need to be resent, otherwise such information will
   be lost.

4.5.  Moving flow bindings

   The home agent can move a flow associated to one interface of the
   multi-interfaced mobile node to another by sending a FBI message to
   the mobile node.  A Flow Identification Mobility option whose Action
   field is set to Move is included.  The address of the target
   interface is also included in the Flow Identification Mobility option
   in Target Care-of Address sub-option.

   In some cases the mobile node manually decides to move an IP Flow
   from one interface, e.g. 3GPP to another e.g.  WLAN.  The home agent
   receives such a request to forward a flow and performs the action.
   We recognize that the manual intervention is always possible and
   generally has precedence to other policies.  On such a flow HA-
   initiated move operation SHOULD not be used.  If used, MN will move
   it back and a set of ping-pong move operations will take place.  Home
   agent SHOULD move such a flow only if network conditions require it
   to be moved such as congestion on the current interface because such
   conditions can best be detected by the home agent only and not by the
   mobile nodes.

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      June 2010


4.6.  Switching flow bindings

   Here are some example scenarios where a home agent signal to the
   mobile node that it should acquire a new home agent for some specific
   flows:
   o  The home agent is overloaded.
   o  An operator may wish to balance the load among home agents.
   o  Operators do periodic maintenance in order to maintain reliability
      [I-D.ietf-mip6-hareliability].
   o  Some other scenarios.

   The home agent sends the mobile node a FBI with Flow Identification
   Mobility Option to indicate that the mobile node should bind a flow
   to a new home agent.  The alternative home agent addresses are
   included for the mobile node to initiate the flow binding to a new
   home agent.

   The switch operation is similar to hard switch described in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hareliability] where standby and active home agents
   have different IP addresses.  In the switch operation both home
   agents continue to serve the mobile node using the same Home Address
   while in hard switch the active home agent stops serving and the
   standby home agent takes over.

4.7.  Acknowledging flow bindings

   The mobile node sends FBA message to acknowledge the reception of FBI
   to Add, Delete, Modify, Refresh, Move, or Switch a flow binding.  On
   receiving messages with Flow Identification Mobility Option(s), the
   mobile node should copy each Flow Identification Mobility Option to
   the Acknowledgement messages.

4.8.  Revoking flow bindings

   Home agent revokes a flow binding registration by the mobile node,
   i.e. flow identification mobility option sent by MN with action set
   to forward.  One possible reason is the home agent if overloaded.
   There could be other reasons.

   HA sends Binding Revocation Indication message defined in [RFC5846]
   extended with flow identification mobility option.  HA includes the
   flow identification mobility option received from MN.  HA sets the
   action field to Revoke.

   MN MUST send a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message defined in
   [RFC5846] to indicate that it has received Binding Revocation
   Indication message.  If MN accepts the Binding Revocation Indication
   message it MUST set the status code to 0 for success or to 1 for

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6      June 2010


   partial success as described in [RFC5846].

4.9.  Handling of the Flow Bindings List

   Flow bindings list defined in [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] needs to
   be modified after each protocol operation defined above as follows:

   If FBI contains a flow binding add operation and if the corresponding
   FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST add a new entry
   to the flow bindings list.  FID, Flow Descriptor, FID-PRI and Action
   fields are taken from the Flow Identification Mobility Option.  BID
   is copied from the Binding Reference sub-option.  Active/Inactive
   Flag is set to Active.  Note that if BID is not available it may be
   replaced by Care-of-Address.

   If FBI contains a flow binding delete operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then delete the
   entry.

   If the home agent sends a Binding Revocation Indication message with
   Flow Mobility Option where the action field is set to Revoke and if
   the corresponding Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message
   indicates acceptance, home agent MUST locate the list entry
   corresponding to this flow and then delete the entry.

   If FBI contains a flow binding modify operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   delete the list entry corresponding to this flow and then add a new
   entry setting the values as defined in the Flow Identification
   Mobility Option.

   If FBI contains a flow binding refresh operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then set Active/
   Inactive Flag to Active.

   If FBI contains a flow binding move operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then change the
   BID value to the Care-of-Address in the Flow Identification Mobility
   Option.

   If FBI contains a flow binding switch operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then delete the
   entry.

   Flow binding operations apply equally to IPv6 packets as well as IPv4
   packets as in Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 [RFC5555].

   The Flow Binding Indication messages are used by the home agent to
   initiate flow binding operations to the mobile node.  The Flow
   Binding Indication messages use the MH Type value (IANA-TBD1) for
   Flow Binding message and a Flow Binding Type value of 1, and the
   format of the Message Data field in the Mobility Header is as
   follows:

5.1.2.  Flow Binding Acknowledgement

   The Flow Binding Acknowledgement is used to acknowledge receipt of a
   Flow Binding Indication.  The Flow Binding Acknowledgement has the MH
   Type value (IANA-TBD1) for Flow Binding message and a Flow Binding
   Type value of 2.  When this value is indicated in the MH Type field,
   the format of the Message Data field in the Mobility Header is as
   follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3

      The sequence number in the Flow Binding Acknowledgement is copied
      from the Sequence Number field in the Flow Binding Indication.
   Status

      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the result of processing the
      Flow Binding Indication message by the receiving mobile node.
      Values of the Status field less than 128 indicate that the Flow
      Binding Indication was processed successfully by the receiving
      node.  Values greater than or equal to 128 indicate that the Flow
      Binding Indication was rejected by the receiving node.  The
      following status values are currently defined:
   0  success
   1  partial success
   128  Binding Does NOT Exist
    All other values are Reserved
   Mobility Options

      Variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility
      Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  This field
      contains zero or more TLV-encoded mobility options.  Flow

5.2.1.  New Actions in Flow Identification Mobility Option

   This specification defines new actions to be carried in Action
   parameter of the Flow Identification Mobility Option defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].
   Action

      This is a 8-bit field that describes the required processing for
      the option.  It can be assigned one of the following new values in
      addition to 0-2 already assigned:
   11  Add a flow binding
   12  Delete a flow binding
   13  Modify  a flow binding
   14  Refresh  a  flow binding
   15  Move a flow binding
   16  Switch a flow binding  to alternative home agents
   17  Revoke a flow binding
   All other values are reserved

5.2.2.  Alternate Home Agent sub-option

   This section introduces the Alternate Home Agent sub-option, which
   may be included in the Flow Identification Mobility option.  This
   sub-option is used to indicate the mobile node to switch a flow
   binding from one home agent to another.

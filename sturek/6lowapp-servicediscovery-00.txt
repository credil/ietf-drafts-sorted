Abstract

   IEEE 802.15.4 networked solutions employing [RFC4944] for 
   applications like Smart Grid Home Area Networking require unattended 
   service discovery which can be supported with small, single packet 
   (or few packet) exchanges.  At the same time, it is desirable to mix 
   wired devices into the same network so interoperation of service 
   discovery between devices with differing operational characteristics 
   is desired.

Internet-Draft    Service Discovery for 6LowApp             October 2009

1.  Introduction

   Service Discovery for 6LowAPP envisions extending the Service 
   Location Protocol ([RFC2608]) for deployment on small packet size 
   devices.  The focus for Service Discovery for 6LowAPP is around 
   extending SLP to permit tokenized exchange of XML strings.

   A previous expired Internet Draft exists extending SLP for embedded
   device.  This prior Internet Draft was evaluated but did not include
   full exchange of tokenized strings.  

   This internet-draft addresses requirements stated in 
   [I-D.bormann-6lowpan-6lowapp-problem].

2.  Description

    The IETF Service Location Protocol ([RFC2608]) is a standards track 
   RFC deployed for internet applications.  SLP enables definition of 
   service scopes, services and attributes.   The discovery mechanism 
   utilizes User Agents (devices wishing to locate services), Service 
   Agents (devices supplying services) and Directory Agents (proxies 
   which can cache service information on behalf of Service Agents).    
   SLP utilizes text strings in the service request and response 
   messages.

2.1  Service Discovery Messaging
   
   The specification of Service Discovery for 6LowAPP envisions the 
   following:
        o   Creation of a new RFC which preserves the core features of 
            SLP but replaces the message exchange with tokenized fields

   The new RFC preserves the semantics of the following SLP messages:
        o   Service Request
        o   Service Reply
        o   Service Registration
        o   Service Acknowledgement
        o   Directory Agent Advertisement
        o   Service Agent Advertisement

   The new RFC envisions extending the SLP messages to include the 
   following:
        o   (new command)  Directory Agent Token Map Request
        o   (new command)  Directory Agent Token Map Response

   The new Internet Draft supports the following message semantics:
        o   Scope and Scope Lists
        o   Services and Service Lists
        o   Attributes and Attribute Lists
        o   (new message semantic)  Token Map for Scope, Services and 
            Attributes

Internet-Draft    Service Discovery for 6LowApp             October 2009

2.2   Service Discovery Semantics

   The key architectural aspect of the proposed Internet Draft is a 
   mapping of the features and capabilities of the binary service 
   discovery protocol used in previous IEEE 802.15.4 deployments to the 
   features and capabilities of [RFC2608].  The similarities between the 
   ZigBee binary protocol and SLP ([RFC2608]) include:
        o   Held discovery information in Service Agents (self 
            describing data held in the individual devices)
        o   Unicast and Multicast discovery requests via Service Request 
            primitives
        o   Unicast discovery responses via Service Reply
        o   (Optional) Service Registration (Directory Agent support
            for cached discovery information)

   Here are the proposed architectural principles for the proposed 
   Internet Draft:
        o   Use the Directory Agent to cache (via an XML Schema 
            exchange) a mapping between Scope strings and a well known 
            token
        o   Use the Directory Agent to cache (via an XML Schema 
            exchange) a mapping between Service strings and a well known 
            token
        o   Use the Directory Agent to cache (via an XML Schema 
            exchange) a mapping between Attribute strings and well known 
            tokens

   The above mapping works in an IEEE 802.15.4 network and, importantly,
   interoperates with SLP with networked wired devices if the following
   is performed operationally:
        o   Create a small set of well known Scope strings for the 
            deployment.  This set can be extended via a schema exchange 
            but the management of the set of Scope strings is important 
            to maintain in a consistent manner
        o   Create a small set of well known Service strings and 
            Attribute strings.
        o   Host the exchange of XML strings and tokens in the same
            Directory Agent supported by SLP.
        o   Support Service Discovery for 6LowAPP using a well known UDP
            port enabling interoperation with SLP on TCP port 427
        o   Support a setup phase where the IEEE 802.15.4 devices
            exchange well known XML strings  (operationally defined) for
            well known tokens.  After the initial exchange of XML 
            strings for tokens, all requests and responses are via 
            tokens.

2.3   Service Discovery Operations

   The following operations are proposed for the new Internet Draft:
        o   Identify a Directory Agent for each instance of the HAN.  
            Unlike RFC 2608 [RFC2608], the main role of the DA in the 
            proposed I-D is for storage of the mapping between well 
            known tokens and the SLP Scope, Service and Attribute 
            strings.
        o   Devices joining the network perform DA discovery then use 
            the new DA Token Map Request and populate their local tables 
            with the DA Token Map Response.
        o   Devices use the new I-D Service Request and Service Reply 
            where the tokens in the map replace the strings used in RFC 
            2608 [RFC2608].  For search functions, the portion of the 
            string operations needed to perform the service match must 
            be included in the proposed I-D messaging

   The following operational aspects are desired for the proposed I-D:
        o   Outside of the initial download of the Token Map, the 
            operations proposed mirror the features currently deployed 
            in existing IEEE 802.15.4 deployments like ZigBee.  The 
            intent is that we use Service Agents (SA) not the Directory 
            Agent (DA) but we have the flexibility to use the DA for 
            sleeping devices if we want
        o   Since the proposed I-D maps to SLP RFC 2608 [RFC2608], it 
            is envisaged that both can be supported in the same network 
            with a mechanism to communicate to the requesting device 
            which service discovery method is supported by a given 
            device.

   Here are a couple of points to keep in mind with new I-D:
        o   The proposed I-D proposes to maintain the same types of SLP 
            messages but not retain the exact packet format.  In 
            particular, the proposed I-D will reformulate the message 
            frames to remove some fields and to tokenize the rest
        o   The proposed I-D seeks to maintain a mapping to SLP RFC 2608 
            [RFC2608] to enable use of either service discovery method 
            in the same network (supported through the Token Map)
        o   The proposed I-D seeks to maintain the same unicast, 
            multicast and advertisement communication paradigm as RFC 
            2608 [RFC2608].

3.  Future Work

   The outline of work presented in this I-D needs to be evaluated 
   against the requirements presented in the 6LowAPP charter and against 
   RFC 2608 [RFC2608].  If accepted, the next step is to create a 
   concrete protocol proposal.


4.  Conclusions

   [RFC2608] forms a good basis of design for service discovery.  
   However, the use of XML strings in the protocol are problematic for 
   IEEE 802.15.4 devices.  This I-D seeks to extend the concepts of SLP 
   into a parallel binary service discovery protocol which enables 
   operations from a common Directory Agent.  


5.  Security Considerations

   No new security issues have been identified in this draft.  This I-D 
   envisions using the same security considerations employed in RFC 
   2608 [RFC2608].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft envisions assignment of a dedicated port for 6LowAPP 
   Service Discovery.

  XML2RFC offers an include feature described in the XML2RFC README
  file.  That syntax, however, contradicts the DTD requirements to
  have <reference> elements within the <references> element, so an 
  XML parser is likely to find your XML file invalid.  It may be
  possible that XML2RFC will change their DTD so that the XML file
  remains valid when their style of include is used.

  In the meantime therefore, we use an alternative valid-XML approach
  to includes, which unfortunately require that define your includes
  at the beginning of the file. Since the biggest benefit of includes
  is for references, this requires that your references be defined in
  ENTITY clauses here before being "included" and cited elsewhere in
  the file.

    <abstract>
    <t>This document specifies the use of several ECC Brainpool elliptic curves for authentication and key exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</t>
    </abstract>

  </front>

  
  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">

  <t>In <xref target='RFC5639' />, a new set of elliptic curve groups over
   finite prime fields for use in cryptographic applications was specified. These groups, denoted as ECC Brainpool curves, were generated in a verifiably pseudo-random way and comply with the security requirements of relevant standards from ISO <xref target='ISO1' /> <xref target='ISO2' />, ANSI <xref target='ANSI1' />, NIST <xref target='FIPS' />, and SecG <xref target='SEC2' />. </t>
      
  
   <t>Usage of elliptic curves for authentication and key agreement in TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 is defined in  <xref target='RFC4492' />. While the ASN.1 object identifiers defined in <xref target='RFC5639' /> already allow usage of the ECC Brainpool curves for TLS (client or server) authentication through reference in X.509 certificates according to <xref target='RFC3279' />, their negotiation for key exchange according to <xref target='RFC4492' /> requires the definition and assignment of additional NamedCurve IDs. This document specifies such values for three curves from <xref target='RFC5639' />.</t>
   </section>

   <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target='RFC2119' /> </t>.

-->
 
  <section anchor="Spec" title="Values to be Used in the Supported Elliptic Curve Extension">
  
 
     <t>According to <xref target='RFC4492' />, the Supported Elliptic Curve Extension allows the negotiation of elliptic curve groups during a handshake starting a new TLS session. A client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its ClientHello message SHOULD include this extension to indicate the elliptic curves it supports through NamedCurve IDs, and a server that receives a ClientHello containing this extension MUST use the client's enumerated capabilities to guide its selection of an appropriate cipher suite. Furthermore, the server SHOULD use a NamedCurve ID, if applicable, to specify the elliptic curve corresponding to its ephemeral ECDH public key.</t>
     <t>The values of NamedCurve, by which the elliptic curves are identified, are governed by the EC Named Curve Registry of IANA <xref target='IANA-TLS' />. In <xref target='namedCurves' />, new values for NamedCurve for three of the ECC Brainpool curves defined in <xref target='RFC5639' /> are specified. All three curves are suitable for usage in DTLS <xref target='RFC6347' />.</t>

<t>Test vectors for a Diffie-Hellman key exchange using these ECC Brainpool curves are provided in <xref target='test_vectors' /></t>
 </section>
 


   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
   <t>The security considerations of <xref target='RFC5246' /> apply accordingly. </t>
    <t>The confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of the TLS communication is limited by the weakest cryptographic primitive applied. In order to achieve a maximum security level when using one of the elliptic curves from <xref target='namedCurves' /> for authentication and / or key exchange in TLS, the key derivation function, the algorithms and key lengths of symmetric encryption and message authentication as well as the algorithm, bit length and hash function used for signature generation should be chosen according to the recommendations of <xref target="NIST800-57"/> and <xref target="RFC5639"/>. Furthermore, the private Diffie-Hellman keys should be selected with the same bit length as the order of the group generated by the base point G and with approximately maximum entropy.</t> 

    
	<t>Implementations of elliptic curve cryptography for TLS may be susceptible to side-channel attacks.  Particular care should be taken for implementations that internally transform curve points to points on the corresponding "twisted curve", using the map (x',y') = (x*Z^2, y*Z^3) with the coefficient Z specified for that curve in <xref target='RFC5639' />, in order to take advantage of an an efficient arithmetic based on the twisted curve's special parameters (A = -3): although the twisted curve itself offers the same level of security as the corresponding random curve (through mathematical equivalence), an arithmetic based on small curve parameters may be harder to protect against side-channel attacks. General guidance on resistence of elliptic curve cryptography implementations against side-channel-attacks is given in <xref target='BSI1' /> and <xref target="HMV"/>.</t>

  </section>

      
  <section title="IANA Considerations">
  <t> Before this document can become an RFC, IANA is required to assign numbers for the elliptic curves specified in <xref target='namedCurves' /> to the NamedCurve name space in its Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters registry <xref target='IANA-TLS' />. For all these elliptic curves, suitability with DTLS shall be indicated in the registry. </t>
  </section>

    
   <section title="Intellectual Property Rights">

   <t>Although, the authors have no knowledge about any intellectual property rights
   which cover the general usage of the ECP groups defined herein, implementations based on these
   domain parameters may require use of inventions covered by patent rights. In particular, techniques for an efficient arithmetic exploiting the special parameters of the twisted curves (see <xref target="Security"/>) may be covered by patents.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of <xref target='RFC2223bis' /> specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.

<t>This document specifies version 1.2 of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  The DTLS protocol provides communications privacy for datagram protocols.  The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.  The DTLS protocol is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and provides equivalent security guarantees.  Datagram semantics of the underlying transport are preserved by the DTLS protocol.  This document updates DTLS 1.0 to work with TLS version 1.2. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

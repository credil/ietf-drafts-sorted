Internet-Draft    Structure of the GSS Negotiation Loop    November 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Generic Security Service Application Program Intervace version 2
   [RFC2743] provides a generic interface for security services, in the
   form of an abstraction layer over the underlying security mechanisms
   that an application may use.  A GSS initiator and acceptor exchange
   messages, called tokens, until a security context is established.
   Such a security context allows for mutual authentication of the two
   parties, the passing of confidential or integrity-protected messages
   between the initiator and acceptor, the generation of identical
   pseudo-random bit strings by both participants [RFC4401], and more.
   The number of tokens which must be exchanged between initiator and
   acceptor in order to establish the security context is dependent on
   the underlying mechanism as well as the desired properties of the
   security context, and is in general not known to the application.
   Accordingly, the application's control flow must include a loop
   within which GSS security context tokens are exchanged, which
   terminates upon successful establishment of a security context (or an
   error condition).

   The GSS-API C bindings [RFC2744] provide some example code for such a
   negotiation loop, but this code does not specify the application's
   behavior on unexpected or error conditions.  As such, individual
   application protocol specifications have had to specify the structure
   of their GSS negotiation loops, including error handling, on a per-
   protocol basis.  [RFC4462], [RFC3645], [RFC5801], [RFC4752],
   [RFC2203] This represents a substantial duplication of effort, and
   the various specifications go into different levels of detail and
   describe different possible error conditions.  It is therefore
   preferable to have the structure of the GSS negotiation loop,
   including error conditions and token passing, described in a single
   specification, which can then be referred to from other documents in
   lieu of repeating the structure of the loop each time.  This document
   will perform that role.

   The necessary requirements for correctly performing a GSS negotiation
   loop are essentially all included in [RFC2743], but they are
   scattered in many different places.  This document brings all the
   requirements together into one place for the convenience of
   implementors, even though the normative requirements remain in
   [RFC2743].  In a few places, this document notes additional behavior
   which is useful for applications but is not mandated by [RFC2743].

Internet-Draft    Structure of the GSS Negotiation Loop    November 2013


2.  Loop Structure

   The loop is begun by the appropriately named initiator, which calls
   GSS_Init_sec_context() with an empty (zero-length) input_token and a
   fixed set of input flags containing the desired attributes for the
   security context.  The initiator should not change any of the input
   parameters to GSS_Init_sec_context() between calls to it during the
   loop, with the exception of the input_token parameter, which will
   contain a message from the acceptor after the initial call, and the
   input_context_handle, which must be the result returned in the
   output_context_handle of the previous call to GSS_Init_sec_context()
   (or GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT for the first call).  (In the C bindings, there
   is only a single read/modify context_handle argument.)  RFC 2743 only
   requires that the claimant_cred_handle argument remain constant over
   all calls in the loop, but the other non-excepted arguments should
   also remain fixed for reliable operation.

   The following subsections will describe the various steps of the
   loop, without special consideration to whether a call to
   GSS_Init_sec_context() or GSS_Accept_sec_context() is the first such
   call in the loop.  For the first call to each routine in the loop,
   the major status code from the previous call to
   GSS_Init_sec_context() or GSS_Accept_sec_context() should be taken as
   GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED.

2.1.  Anonymous Initiators

   If the initiator is requesting anonymity by setting the anon_req_flag
   input to GSS_Init_sec_context(), then on non-error returns from
   GSS_Init_sec_context() (that is, the major status is GSS_S_COMPLETE
   or GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED), the initiator must verify that the output
   value of anon_state from GSS_Init_sec_context() is true before
   sending the security context token to the acceptor.  Failing to
   perform this check could cause the initiator to lose anonymity.

2.2.  GSS_Init_sec_context

   The initiator calls GSS_Init_sec_context(), using the
   input_context_handle for the current proto-security-context and its
   fixed set of input parameters, and the input_token received from the
   acceptor (if not the first iteration of the loop).  The presence of a
   nonempty output_token and the value of the major status code are the
   indicators for how to proceed:

      If the major status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and the output_token is
      empty, then the context negotiation is fully complete and ready
      for use by the initiator with no further actions.

Internet-Draft    Structure of the GSS Negotiation Loop    November 2013


      If the major status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and the output_token is
      nonempty, then the initiator's portion of the security context
      negotiation is complete but the acceptor's is not.  The initiator
      must send the output_token to the acceptor so that the acceptor
      can establish its half of the security context.

      If the major status code is GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED and the
      output_token is nonempty, the context negotiation is incomplete.
      The initiator must send the output_token to the acceptor and await
      another input_token from the acceptor.

      If the major status code is GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED and the
      output_token is empty, the mechanism has produced an output which
      is not compliant with [RFC2743].  However, there are some known
      implementations of certain mechanisms which do produce empty
      context negotiation tokens.  For maximum interoperability,
      applications should be prepared to accept such tokens, and should
      transmit them to the acceptor if they are generated.

      If the major status code is any other value, the context
      negotiation has failed.  If the output_token is nonempty, it is an
      error token, and the initiator should send it to the acceptor.  If
      the output_token is empty, then the initiator should indicate the
      failure to the acceptor if an appropriate channel to do so is
      available.

2.3.  Sending from Initiator to Acceptor

   The establishment of a GSS security context between initiator and
   acceptor requires some communication channel by which to exchange the
   context negotiation tokens.  The nature of this channel is not
   specified by the GSS specification -- it could be a synchronous TCP
   channel, a UDP-based RPC protocol, or any other sort of channel.  In
   many cases, the channel will be multiplexed with non-GSS application
   data; the application protocol must provide some means by which the
   GSS context tokens can be identified and passed through to the
   mechanism accordingly.  It is in such cases where the application
   protocol has a means to indicate error conditions that the initiator
   could indicate a failure to the acceptor, as mentioned in some of the
   above cases conditional on "an appropriate channel to do so".

   However, even the presence of a communication channel does not
   necessarily indicate that it is appropriate for the initiator to
   indicate such errors.  For example, if the acceptor is a stateless or
   near-stateless UDP server, there is probably no need for the
   initiator to explicitly indicate its failure to the acceptor.
   Conditions such as this can be treated in individual application
   protocol specifications.

Internet-Draft    Structure of the GSS Negotiation Loop    November 2013


   If a regular security context output_token is produced by the call to
   GSS_Init_sec_context(), the initiator must transmit this token to the
   acceptor over the application's communication channel.  If the call
   to GSS_Init_sec_context() returns an error token as output_token, it
   is recommended that the intiator transmit this token to the acceptor
   over the application's communication channel.

2.4.  Acceptor Sanity Checking

   The acceptor's half of the negotiation loop is triggered by the
   receipt of a context token from the initiator.  Before calling
   GSS_Accept_sec_context(), the acceptor may find it useful to perform
   some sanity checks on the state of the negotiation loop.

   If the acceptor receives a context token but was not expecting such a
   token (for example, if the acceptor's previous call to
   GSS_Accept_sec_context() returned GSS_S_COMPLETE), this is probably
   an error condition indicating that the initiator's state is invalid.
   See Section 3.2 for some exceptional cases.  It is likely appropriate
   for the acceptor to report this error condition to the acceptor via
   the application's communication channel.

   If the acceptor is expecting a context token (e.g., if the previous
   call to GSS_Accept_sec_context() returned GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED), but
   does not receive such a token within a reasonable amount of time
   after transmitting the previous output_token to the initiator, the
   acceptor should assume that the initiator's state is invalid and fail
   the GSS negotiation.  Again, it is likely appropriate for the
   acceptor to report this error condition to the initiator via the
   application's communication channel.

   [Are there other checks to perform here?]

2.5.  GSS_Accept_sec_context

   The GSS acceptor responds to the actions of an initiator; as such,
   there should always be a nonempty input_token to calls to
   GSS_Accept_sec_context().  The input_context_handle parameter will
   always be given as the output_context_handle from the previous call
   to GSS_Accept_sec_context() in a given negotiation loop (or
   GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT on the first call), but the acceptor_cred_handle and
   chan_bindings arguments should remain fixed over the course of a
   given GSS negotiation loop.  [RFC2743] only requires that the
   acceptor_cred_handle remain fixed throughout the loop, but the
   chan_bindings argument should also remain fixed for reliable
   operation.

   The GSS acceptor calls GSS_Accept_sec_context(), using the
   input_context_handle for the current proto-security-context and the
   input_token received from the initiator.  The presence of a nonempty
   output_token and the value of the major status code are the
   indicators for how to proceed:

      If the major status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and the output_token is
      empty, then the context negotiation is fully complete and ready
      for use by the acceptor with no further actions.

      If the major status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and the output_token is
      nonempty, then the acceptor's portion of the security context
      negotiation is complete but the initiator's is not.  The acceptor
      must send the output_token to the initiator so that the initiator
      can establish its half of the security context.

      If the major status code is GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED and the
      output_token is nonempty, the context negotiation is incomplete.
      The acceptor must send the output_token to the initiator and await
      another input_token from the initiator.

      If the major status code is GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED and the
      output_token is empty, the mechanism has produced an output which
      is not compliant with [RFC2743].  output which is not compliant
      with [RFC2743].  However, there are some known implementations of
      certain mechanisms which do produce empty context negotiation
      tokens.  For maximum interoperability, applications should be
      prepared to accept such tokens, and should transmit them to the
      initiator if they are generated.

      If the major status code is any other value, the context
      negotiation has failed.  If the output_token is nonempty, it is an
      error token, and the acceptor should send it to the initiator.  If
      the output_token is empty, then the acceptor should indicate the
      failure to the initiator if an appropriate channel to do so is
      available.

2.6.  Sending from Acceptor to Initiator

   The mechanism for sending the context token from acceptor to
   initiator will depend on the nature of the communication channel
   between the two parties.  For a synchronous bidirectional channel, it
   can be just another piece of data sent over the link, but for a
   stateless UDP RPC acceptor, the token will probably end up being sent
   as an RPC output parameter.  Application protocol specifications will
   need to specify the nature of this behavior.

Internet-Draft    Structure of the GSS Negotiation Loop    November 2013


   If the application protocol has the initiator driving the
   application's control flow (with the acceptor just responding to
   actions from the initiator), it is particularly helpful for the
   acceptor to indicate a failure to the initiator, as mentioned in some
   of the above cases conditional on "an appropriate channel to do so".

   If a regular security context output_token is produced by the call to
   GSS_Accept_sec_context(), the acceptor must transmit this token to
   the initiator over the application's communication channel.  If the
   call to GSS_Accept_sec_context() returns an error token as
   output_token, it is recommended that the acceptor transmit this token
   to the initiator over the application's communication channel.

2.7.  Initiator input validation

   The initiator's half of the negotiation loop is triggered (after the
   first call) by receipt of a context token from the acceptor.  Before
   calling GSS_Init_sec_context(), the initiator may find it useful to
   perform some sanity checks on the state of the negotiation loop.

   If the initiator receives a context token but was not expecting such
   a token (for example, if the initiator's previous call to
   GSS_Init_sec_context() returned GSS_S_COMPLETE), this is probably an
   error condition indicating that the acceptor's state is invalid.  See
   Section 3.2 for some exceptional cases.  It may be appropriate for
   the initiator to report this error condition to the acceptor via the
   application's communication channel.

   If the initiator is expecting a context token (that is, the previous
   call to GSS_Init_sec_context() returned GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED), but
   does not receive such a token within a reasonable amount of time
   after transmitting the previous output_token to the acceptor, the
   initiator should assume that the acceptor's state is invalid and fail
   the GSS negotiation.  Again, it may be appropriate for the initiator
   to report this error condition to the acceptor via the application's
   communication channel.

   [Are there other checks to perform here?]

2.8.  Continue the Loop

   If the loop is in neither a success or failure condition, then the
   loop must continue.  Control flow returns to Section 2.2.

3.  After Security Context Negotiation

   Once a party has completed its half of the security context and
   fulfilled its obligations to the other party, the context is

   complete, but it is not necessarily ready and appropriate for use.
   (In some cases the context may be ready for use earlier than this,
   see Section 3.1.)  In particular, the security context flags may not
   be appropriate for the given application's use.

   The initiator specifies as part of its fixed set of inputs to
   GSS_Init_sec_context() values for the following booleans:
   deleg_req_flag, mutual_req_flag, replay_det_req_flag,
   sequence_req_flag, conf_req_flag, and integ_req_flag.  Upon
   completion of security context negotiation, the initiator must verify
   the values of the deleg_state, mutual_state, replay_det_state,
   sequence_state, conf_avail, and integ_avail flags from the last call
   to GSS_Init_sec_context() corresponding to the requested flags.  If a
   flag was requested but is not available, and that feature is
   necessary for the appplication protocol, the initiator must destroy
   the security context and not use the security context for application
   traffic.

   Application protocol specifications citing this document should
   indicate which context flags are required for the application
   protocol.

   The acceptor receives as output the following booleans: deleg_state,
   mutual_state, replay_det_state, sequence_state, anon_state,
   trans_state, conf_avail, and integ_avail.  The acceptor must verify
   that any flags necessary for the application protocol are set.  If a
   necessary flag is not set, the acceptor must destroy the security
   context and not use the security context for application traffic.

3.1.  Using Partially Complete Security Contexts

   For mechanism/flag combinations that require multiple token
   exchanges, an application protocol may find it desirable to begin
   sending application data protected with GSS per-message operations
   while continuing to exchange security context tokens to complete the
   security context negotiation.  The prot_ready_state output value from
   GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context() indicates when
   per-message operations are avaialble.

   Applications requiring confidentiality and/or integrity protection
   from such messages must check the value of the conf_avail and/or
   integ_avail output flags from GSS_Init_sec_context()/
   GSS_Accept_sec_context() as well as the conf_state output of
   GSS_Wrap() (if GSS_Wrap() is used).

3.2.  Additional Context Tokens

Internet-Draft    Structure of the GSS Negotiation Loop    November 2013


   Under some (rare) conditions, a context token will be received by a
   party to a security context negotiation after that party has
   completed the negotiation (i.e., after GSS_Init_sec_context() or
   GSS_Accept_sec_context() has returned GSS_S_COMPLETE).  Such tokens
   must be passed to GSS_Process_context_token() for processing.

   The most common cause of such tokens is security context deletion
   tokens, emitted when the remote party called GSS_Delete_sec_context()
   with a non-null output_context_token parameter.  With the GSS-API
   version 2, it is not recommended to use security context deletion
   tokens.

   Extra security context tokens can also be emitted if the selected
   mechanism specifies some functionality (such as per-message
   confidentiality protection) as optional-to-implement, and the
   acceptor's implementation does not implement the optional
   functionality, but the functionality was requested by the initiator.
   In this case, the acceptor's GSS implementation is required to emit
   at least one context token (even when one would not otherwise be
   needed to complete the context negotiation), and this can result in
   an "extra" token.

   In the rare case when an application receives an extra context token,
   GSS_Inquire_context() should be used after processing the extra token
   to re-verify that the context does support the features necessary for
   the application protocol.  This will also indicate whether the token
   was a deletion token, in which case the major status will be
   GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT.

4.  Sample Code

   This section gives sample code for the GSS negotiation loop, both for
   a regular application and for an application where the initiator
   wishes to remain anonymous.  Since the code for the two cases is very
   similar, the anonymous-specific additions are wrapped in preprocessor
   conditionals which may be ignored if anonymous processing is not
   needed.

   Since the communication channel between the initiator and acceptor is
   a matter for individual application protocols, it is inherently
   unspecified at the GSS-API level, which can lead to examples that are
   less satisfying than may be desired.  For example, the sample code in
   [RFC2744] uses an unspecified send_token_to_peer() routine.  In the
   interest of concreteness, this sample code uses pipes for
   communication between initiator and acceptor, so that explicit read()
   and write() may be used.

   This sample code is written in C, using the GSS-API C bindings
   [RFC2744].  It uses the macro GSS_ERROR() to help unpack the various
   sorts of information which can be stored in the major status field;
   supplementary information does not necessarily indicate an error.
   Applications written in other languages will need to exercise care
   that checks against the major status value are written correctly.

   This sample code should be compilable as a standalone program, linked
   against a GSS-API library.  With most implementations, in order for
   it to successfully run, the initiator will need to specify an
   explicit target name for the acceptor (which must match the
   credentials available to the acceptor).  A skeleton for how this may
   be done is provided, in a disabled block of code.

   This sample code assumes v2 of the GSS-API.  Applications wishing to
   remain compatible with v1 of the GSS-API may need to perform
   additional checks in some locations.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document provides a (reasonably) concise description and example
   for correct construction of the GSS-API security context negotiation
   loop.  Since everything relating to the construction and use of a GSS
   security context is security-related, there are security-relevant
   considerations throughout the document.  It is useul to call out a
   few things in this section, though.

   The GSS-API uses a request-and-check model for features.  An
   application using the GSS-API requests that certain features
   (confidentiality protection for messages, or anonynimity), but such a
   request does not require the GSS implementation to provide the
   feature.  The application must check the returned flags to verify
   whether a requested feature is present; if the feature was non-
   optional for the application, the application must generate an error.
   Phrased differently, the GSS-API will not generate an error if it is
   unable to satisfy the features requested by the application.

           Server notification mechanism for ALTO optimization
                    draft-sun-alto-notification-02.txt


Abstract

The cooperation between Internet application and network enhances not
only the efficiency of network transportation but also the experiences
of end users. To design the information exchanging protocol and
architecture that facilitate such cooperation is the objective of
Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) working group.

Currently, ALTO protocol adopts an efficient query/response message
based on the prevalent http protocol. However, such protocol cannot
support rapid dispatch of ALTO information. Noted that many scenarios
require the updated network information to be dispatched to clients as
soon as possible, such as when part of the network is congested, when a
new policy is to be deployed urgently, or when unexpected network
maintenance is required. To tackle such problem, this draft proposed a
server notification extension to the original query/response mechanism.

1. Introduction

   Internet application, especially p2p applications, can benefit from
   knowing the underlying network topology information via the ALTO
   protocol [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol]. The ALTO clients query the ALTO
   server periodically to get the updated ALTO information. Such method
   is simple and effective given that the ALTO information is seldom
   changes.

   However, there are some situations that the ALTO information changes
   occasionally. For example, due to network congestion, traffic load

   fluctuation, or management requirement, an ISP may change its
   traffic optimization policy. This generally results in an update of
   ALTO information.

   With simple query/response method, a possible way to tackle such
   situations is to shorten the query interval. But this may flood the
   ALTO sever with a large amount of query messages. A shorter query
   interval also increases the traffic generated by ALTO. That is, a
   shorter query interval may exacerbate the network congestion in some
   sense. Moreover, as most of the ALTO information seldom changes, the
   information carried is not proportional to the amount of traffic
   generated.

   Another method is to modify the ALTO protocol. If the ALTO server
   can notify the ALTO clients proactively the change of ALTO
   information, the traffic formed by the ALTO clients will be
   optimized timely. The ALTO server and the ALTO clients will be
   relieved from the unnecessary query/response messages.

   This draft describes the ALTO server notification mechanism which
   can be incorporated into the current ALTO protocol, its main
   applicable scope and the detail process. Such mechanism can
   certainly increase the efficiency of ALTO protocol.



2. Server Notification Mechanism

2.1. Overview of Server Notification Mechanism

   Within currently ALTO protocol, the ALTO clients can only get the
   ALTO information via the query/response mechanism. The query period

Internet-Draft            < Notification >                    May 2010


   is one key parameter that needs to be considered. If this value is
   set very short, ALTO messages may burden the underlying network; if
   it is set very long, the ALTO clients may not able to get the
   updated ALTO information in time.

   Given that the ISP may change their policy occasionally, enable the
   ALTO server to notify the clients of updated ALTO information as
   soon as possible is reasonable. When an ALTO server determines that
   a major change has occurred and the clients should know the change,
   the server broadcast a notification message to its clients. On
   receiving the notification message, the ALTO clients can send a
   query message to the server and fetch the ALTO information that they
   interested in.



2.2. Scope of server notification mechanism

   The ALTO protocol is aimed to p2p and non-p2p internet applications
   that can utilize the network information to optimize their
   performances.

   From the statistics of China Telecom's IP traffic reports, the
   tracked-based p2p applications and other non-p2p, distributed web
   services (such as CDN-based web services) produce exceed 80% of the
   internet traffic. The developers of these applications are also more
   easily cooperative with ISP to increase the traffic transport
   efficiency.

   This draft will focus mainly on these applications that creating
   large amounts of flow in internet.

2.3. Registration Methods of ALTO Clients

   In order to notify the ALTO clients actively, the ALTO server needs
   to know the IP addresses and the listening ports of an ALTO client
   in advance. Such information can be gotten via the contracts with
   ISP or by other out-of-band methods.

   The ALTO Server will keep one table (referred as "candidate table"
   in following) that records the IP addresses/ports information of
   these ALTO clients (referred as "registered ALTO clients" in
   following). It will be kept permanently in ALTO sever unless changed
   or removed by the ISP.



2.4. Server Notification Mode

   The server notification mechanism can be designed in a general mode
   or in a specific mode.

   In the general mode, if there is any change of network condition,
   which leads to the information change of network map, cost map or
   other information provided by ALTO server, the server sends notify
   message to all the registered ALTO clients. These registered ALTO
   clients then send the query messages to ALTO server, together with
   their own map filter, to get the interested ALTO information
   respectively.

   With the specific mode, a specific notification message is send to
   all registered ALTO clients. This specific message points out which
   part of the ALTO information has been changed. The interested ALTO
   clients, not all registered ALTO clients, then send query message to

   ALTO server, together with the map filter, to get the changed ALTO
   information.





2.5. Implementation Consideration

   The notification service can lessen the burden of the ALTO server.
   That is, it is acceptable to incorporate such service in the ALTO
   server, as an independent module. However, notification service can
   also be provided by a dedicated notification server, if the
   notification service becomes a burden to the original ALTO server.



3. Server Notification Messaging

   This section specifies notification processing and message format.



3.1. The processing


   Once an ALTO server determines that a notification to its clients is
   required the ALTO server will build the notification message and
   send it to the ALTO clients. Upon receiving the notification, a
   client checks whether the notification is a general notification or
   a specific notification. The local ALTO information updating logic
   of the client determines the next processing step. If the client
   receives a general notification, and the client is willing to update

   its ALTO information, it sends the ALTO query message immediately to
   get the renewed network/cost map. Otherwise, it may just neglect the
   notification and send no more queries. Note that the above ALTO
   query message is the same as the current ALTO query message.

4. Discussion

4.1. tracker-less p2p situation

   The tracker-based and tracker-less p2p application now use different
   information distribution algorithm, and then have different impact
   on ALTO server for current query/response mechanism and the proposed
   notification mechanism. Further research should be devoted on how to
   distribute the ALTO information effectively among track-less p2p
   peers.  If such efficient algorithm can be found, it can then be
   used together with the notification mechanism to improve timely the
   transport efficiency of tracker-less p2p traffic as well.

   One alternative solution to tracker-less situation is that only some
   of p2p peers, which have similar capability (for example, have
   public IP address and are very stable etc.) as p2p tracker, will be
   contacted by the ALTO server directly to get the updated ALTO
   information timely. The other part of p2p peers will get the ALTO
   information via traditionally query/response manner.

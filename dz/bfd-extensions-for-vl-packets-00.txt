Abstract

   This document extends BFD mechanism to support detection function for
   packets with variable lengths.  Through dynamically changing the
   length of BFD packets, it can detect both traditional faults such as
   link failure or route fault, as well as non-forwarding problem for
   packets with a length in a special range, which maybe caused by
   equipment's internal defects.

1.  Introduction

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol (BFD) provides a
   mechanism for liveness detection of arbitrary paths between systems.
   It is intended to provide low-overhead, short-duration detection of
   failures in the path between adjacent forwarding engines, including
   the interfaces, data link(s), and to the extent possible the
   forwarding engines themselves.  It operates independently of media,
   data protocols, and routing protocols.  An additional goal is to
   provide a single mechanism that can be used for liveness detection
   over any media, at any protocol layer, with a wide range of detection
   times and overhead, to avoid a proliferation of different methods.

   BFD uses a three-way handshake mechanism to establish a BFD session,
   for detailed procedure refer to BFD-base document[BFD-base].

   BFD is a simple hello protocol, in many respects, it's similar to the
   detection components of well-known routing protocol.  A pair of
   systems transmit BFD packets periodically over each path between the
   two systems.  If a system stops receiving BFD packets for long
   enough, the detected path is assumed to have failed.  BFD control
   packet has a mandatory section and an optional authentication
   section.  The mandatory section is 24-bytes long, and BFD control
   packets are sent in an encapsulation appropriate to the enviroment.

   This document extends BFD mechanism to support detection function for
   packets with variable lengths.  Through dynamically changing the
   length of BFD packets, it can detect both traditional faults such as
   link failure or route fault, as well as non-forwarding problem for
   packets with a length in a special range.

3.  Motivations

   In actual application networks, there maybe several transmission
   equipments between BFD neighbours, sometimes may have switching
   networks.  Because data packets through the detected path may be of
   different lengths, there may exsit such situations that packets with
   some lengths can be normally forwarded but packets with other lengths
   can't be forwarded.  For example, under some specific implementation,
   packets within a special range may not be forwarded as a result of
   packet forwarding engine fault.  But the normal BFD packets can still
   be forwarded, because BFD packet length is out of the special packet
   range.  In this case, the BFD session is UP, but the customer service
   is DOWN.

   So there is a need to detect this kind of failure and implement Self-
   healing or switch, in order to avoid interruption of traffic
   transmission.

   However, traditional BFD mechanism can't resolve such problem, as a
   standard BFD control packet (no authentication section) is only 24
   bytes.  So BFD can't meet the detection requirements described in the
   former section.  That is to say, if service packets are longer than
   BFD packets, exsiting BFD mechanism can't detect such forwarding
   problem when these packets meet forwarding failures.

   To resolve such problem, this document extends BFD function to make
   it be capable of negotiating the length and change regulation of BFD
   packets.  Through dynamically changing the length of BFD packets, BFD
   mechanism can detect forwarding problems for packets with different
   lengths and implenments appropriate protection operations under a
   failure condition.  It's main characteristic consists in verifying
   the connectivity between BFD neighbours through transmitting BFD
   packets whose lengths change periodically, and switch to a backup
   path as soon as detection times out.  This protection may be
   completed in combination with fast reroute mechanism.

   The extended BFD mechanism in this document can detect forwarding
   failures for packets with a length in a special range, and implements
   protection scheme upon detecting such failures to avoid traffic
   interruption, thereby boosts up the flexibility of BFD.

4.  BFD Extensions

   In order to support transmitting BFD packets with variable lengths,
   there is a need to extend the standard BFD packets defined in BFD-
   base document[BFD-base], allowing BFD neighbours to negotiate the
   transmission regulation of BFD packets.

   Involved Extensions to BFD include: revise version number, extend the
   meaning of the P and F flags, and add a field used for variable
   length packets negotiation.  This new added field contains the
   following contents: Option, Reserved, Step length, Transmitted
   number, Max length and Min length.

5.  Theory of Operation

   BFD's detection function for packets with variable lengths is
   dynamically and regularly changing the length of BFD packets, to
   detect forwarding problem for packets with different lengths.

   This section is about operational procedures for the extended BFD
   mechanism.

   The first step is to negotiate BFD parameters, which includes
   standard parameters defined in BFD-base document as well as required
   parameters for detection function for packets with variable lengths.
   This step should be completed during the connection period for BFD.
   With respect to detection function for packets with variable lengths,
   It mainly negotiates the length intervals and change regulation for
   packets with variable lengths.  When it is a request to negotiate
   such parameters, the P flag in BFD packets should be set to 1, and
   wish to receive a packet with F bit set.

   Each field in extended BFD packets are set as described below:

   Version: it is set to 2 in this document.

   P: It is set to 1, indicating that the transmitting system is
   requesting a parameter change, including variable-length detection
   parameters negotiation, also it is expecting a packet with F bit in
   reply.

   F: It is set to 1, indicating that the transmitting system is
   responding to a received BFD control packet that had a P bit set.
   Note that P flag and Fflag can't be 1 simultaneitly.

   Option: it is set to 1, indicating that this is a BFD packet which
   supports detection function for packets with variable lengths.

   Step length: change gradient of BFD packets that local system
   transmits.  Actual step length requires negotiation with its peer.

   Step length=min( step length that local system supports, step length
   that the peer notified)

   Generally speaking , the longer the step length is , the faster a
   system detects a failure, whereas the worse the accuracy of packets
   length in trouble can be obtained.  In turn, the slower one can
   detect a failure , and the higher the accuracy obtained.

   Transmitted number of BFD packets: it's the number of packets
   transmitted for a specical length , and it also requires a

   negotiation with its peer.

   Transmitted number= min(transmitted number of BFD packets in local
   system, transmitted number of BFD packets the peer notified)

   Max length of BFD control packets:

   To notify its peer of the max length of control packets that local
   system can support, also needs to negotiate with its peer.

   Max length of BFD control packets=max( max length of BFD packets that
   local system supports , max length of control packets that the peer
   notified)

   Min length of BFD control packets:

   To notify its peer of the min length of BFD packets that it can
   support, also need to negotiate with its peer.  In addition, the min
   length should not be less than the length of standard BFD packets in
   BFD-base document.

   Min length of BFD control packets=min( min length of BFD packets that
   local system supports, min length of control packets that the peer
   notified)

   Detection time is dependent on the regulation of BFD control packets
   transmitted .  This document proposes a unidirectional repeatable
   algorithm, that is to say, each system first sends BFD control
   packets with Min length according to the negotiated transmitted
   packets number, then periodically sends control packets with the next
   length according to the negotiated step length, continue this kind of
   increment, and return to sends packets with Min length after coming
   up to the Max length.

   The selection for transmission regulation of BFD packets is shown as
   the figure below:

             Figure 2: transmission regulation of BFD packets

   After successful negotiation described above, both ends succesivelly
   send BFD control packets according to the negotiated parameters.  BFD
   control packets must be complete, that is to say, the min length of
   BFD packets must not be less than standard BFD control packets.  One
   can insert padding after the standard BFD packets in order to obtain
   packets that is longer than the standard packets.  As soon as
   detection times out, BFD indicates link DOWN failure to the client,
   and then implements appropriate operation, such as switch to a backup
   path.

   Upon receiving a BFD control packet, one can record the length of the
   last received packet.  By doing this, one can fix the fault length
   interval when detetion times out.

   In order to make this kind of detection more efficient, operators can
   set the length interval of BFD control packets according to service
   characteristics.

   The key technique of this document consists in selecting proper
   change gradient, this can be selected according to sevice type or
   characteristics.  Generally, if the gradient is too large, one can
   not determine accurately in which length interval does the failure
   occur; otherwise, if it is too small, it may take more time to find
   in which length interval does the failure occurs, and also will
   affect real-timing of BFD mechanism.

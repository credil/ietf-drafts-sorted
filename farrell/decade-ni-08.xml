    <abstract>
      <t>

This document defines a set of ways to identify a thing (a digital object in
this case) using the output from a hash function, specifying a new URI scheme
for this, a way to map those to http URLs, and binary
and human "speakable" formats for these names.  The various formats are
designed to support, but not require, a strong link to the referenced object
such that the referenced object may be authenticated to the same degree as the
reference to it.

    <section title="Introduction">
      
      <t>

Names or identifiers are used in various protocols for identifying resources.
In many scenarios those names or identifiers contain values that are hash
function outputs.  However, different deployments have chosen various different
ways to include hash function outputs in such names or identifiers.  This
document specifies standard ways to do that to aid interoperability.  We begin
with a few example uses for the various ways to include a hash in a name as
they are defined later in this document, for example <xref target="fig-intro"/>
shows an example of the "Named Information" (ni) URI scheme defined here.


</t>

<figure anchor="fig-intro" title="Example ni URI">
<artwork align="center">
<![CDATA[
ni:///sha-256;UyaQV-Ev4rdLoHyJJWCi11OHfrYv9E1aGQAlMO2X_-Q
]]></artwork></figure>

		<t>
Hash function outputs can be used to ensure uniqueness in terms
of mapping URIs <xref target="RFC3986"/> to a specific resource, or to make URIs
hard to guess for security reasons.  Since there is no standard
way to interpret those strings, today in general only the
creator of the URI knows how to use the hash function output.  Other
protocols, such as application layer protocols for accessing "smart objects"
in constrained environments also require more compact (e.g., binary)
forms of such identifiers, while in other situations people may have
to input such values or talk about them, e.g., in a voice call.

	</t>

      <t>

As another example, protocols for accessing in-network storage servers need a way to
identify stored resources uniquely and in a location-independent way so that
replicas on different servers can be accessed by the same name.  Also, such
applications may require verifying that a resource representation that has been
obtained actually corresponds to the name that was used to request the
resource, i.e., verifying the integrity of the name-data binding.

      </t>

	  <t>
        Similarly, in the context of information-centric networking
        <xref target="ref.netinf-design"/> <xref target="ref.ccn"/>
        and elsewhere there is value in being able to compare a
        presented resource against the URI that was dereferenced in
        order to access that resource. If a cryptographically-strong
        comparison function can be used then this allows for many
        forms of in-network storage, without requiring as much trust
        in the infrastructure used to present the resource. The
        outputs of hash functions can be used in this manner, if
        presented in a standard way.

		</t>

        <t>
	  Additional applications might include creating references from
	  web pages delivered over HTTP/TLS; DNS resource records
	  signed using DNSSEC or data values embedded in certificates,
	  Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), or other signed data objects.
	</t>
	
<!--
      <t>
        Accordingly, a standard form of name using a hash outout allows for checking of the
        integrity of the name-data mapping, but it is OPTIONAL for
        implementations to do so when sending, receiving or processing
        these name forms.
      </t>
-->
		
		<t>The "ni" URI scheme defined here is very similar to the "magnet
		link" informally defined in various other protocols. <xref target="magnet"/>
		</t>

      <t>

<!-- 
OLD:
The ni URI scheme also allows for the use of a query string, similar to the
way in which query strings are used in HTTP URLs. A companion specification <xref
target="I-D.hallambaker-decade-ni-params"/> describes specific values that can
be used in such query strings for various purposes and other extensions to this
basic format specification.
-->

Media content-type, alternative locations for retrieval and other additional
information about a resource named using this scheme can be provided using a
query string.  A companion specification <xref
target="I-D.hallambaker-decade-ni-params"/> describes specific values that can
be used in such query strings for these various purposes and other extensions
to this basic format specification.

      </t>

		<t>
			In addition, we also define a ".well-known"
			URL equivalent, and a way to include a hash as a segment
			of an HTTP URL,  
			as well as a binary format for use in protocols that 
			require more compact names and a human-speakable
			text form that could be used, e.g. for reading out (parts of)
			the name over a voice connection.
		</t>

		<t>
			Not all uses of these names require use of the full hash
			output - truncated hashes can be safely used in some
			environments. For this reason, we define a new IANA
			registry for hash functions to be used with this
			specification so as not to mix strong and weak (truncated) hash
			algorithms in other protocol registries.

          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
          document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.

<section anchor="basics" title="Hashes are what Count">

	<t>This section contains basic considerations related to how
we use hash function outputs that are common to all
	formats.</t>

  <t>

When verifying whether two names refer to same object, an implementation MUST
only consider the digest algorithm and the digest value, i.e., it MUST NOT
consider other fields defined below (such as an authority field from a URI or any
parameters).  Implementations MUST consider two hashes identical, regardless of
encoding, if the decoded hashes are based on the same algorithm and have 
the same length and the same binary value.  In that case, the two names can be
treated as referring to the same thing. 

  </t>

          <t>
The sha-256 algorithm as specified in <xref target="SHA-256"/> is mandatory to implement,
that is, implementations MUST be able to generate/send and to accept/process 
names based on a sha-256 hash. However implementations MAY support additional hash
algorithms and MAY use those for specific names, for example in a
constrained environment where sha-256 is non-optimal or where truncated names
are needed to fit into corresponding protocols (when a higher collision
probability can be tolerated).
          </t>

	<t>Truncated hashes MAY be supported if needed. When a hash value is 
	truncated the name MUST indicate this. Therefore we use different hash algorithm
	strings for these, such as sha-256-32 for a 32-bit truncation of a sha-256
	output. (A 32-bit truncated hash is essentially useless for
	security but might be useful for naming.)</t>

	<t>

When a hash value is truncated to N bits the left-most N bits, that is, the
most significant N bits in network byte order, from the binary representation
of the hash value MUST be used as the truncated value. An example of a 128-bit
hash output truncated to 32 bits is shown in <xref target="fig-trunc"/>. 

</t>

<figure anchor="fig-trunc" title="Example of Truncated Hash">
<artwork align="center">
<![CDATA[
         128-bit hash: 0x265357902fe1b7e2a04b897c6025d7a2
32-bit truncated hash: 0x26535790
]]></artwork></figure>

  <t> When the input to the hash algorithm is a public
  key value, as may be used by various security protocols, the hash SHOULD 
	be calculated over the public
  key in an X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure (Section 4.1 of <xref
  target="RFC5280"/>). This input has been chosen primarily for
   compatibility with DANE <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-protocol"/>, but also includes any relevant
	public key parameters in the hash input, which is sometimes
	necessary for security reasons. This does not force
	use of X.509 or full compliance with <xref target="RFC5280"/>
	since formatting any public key as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo is
	relatively straightforward and well supported by libraries. </t>

	<t>Any of the formats defined below can be used to represent the
	resulting name for a public key.</t>

	<t>Other than in the above special case where public keys are used,
	we do not specify the hash function input here. 
	Other specifications are expected to define this.</t>

</section>

      <section anchor="syntax" title="Named Information (ni) URI Format">

        <t>
			A Named Information (ni) URI consists of the following nine components:
        </t>

        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Scheme Name [Required]">The scheme name is 'ni'.  
			</t>
			<t hangText="Colon and Slashes [Required]">The literal "://" </t>
			<t hangText="Authority [Optional]">

The optional authority component may assist applications in accessing the
object named by an ni URI.  There is no default value for the authority field.
(See <xref target="RFC3986"/> Section 3.2.2 for details.) While ni
names with and without an authority differ syntactically from ni names with
different authorities, all three refer to the same object if and only if the
digest algorithm, length, and value are the same.  


			</t>
			<t hangText="One slash [Required]">The literal "/" </t>
            <t hangText="Digest Algorithm [Required]">
              The name of the digest algorithm, as specified in the IANA registry 
				defined in <xref target="IANAbin"/> below.

          </t>

			<t hangText="Separator [Required]">The literal ";" </t>
            <t hangText="Digest Value [Required]">
              The digest value MUST be encoded using the 
base64url <xref target="RFC4648"/> encoding.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Query Parameter separator [Optional] '?'">

			  The query parameter separator acts as a separator between the
digest value and the query parameters (if specified).  For compatibility with
IRIs, non-ASCII characters in the query part MUST be encoded as UTF-8, and the
resulting octets MUST be %-encoded (see <xref target="RFC3986"/> Section 2.1). 

            </t>
            <t hangText="Query Parameters [Optional]">
              A tag=value list of optional query parameters as are used with HTTP URLs
				<xref target="RFC2616"/>
			  with a separator character '&' between each. For example, "foo=bar&baz=bat"
            </t>
          </list>          
        </t>


  <t>
    It is OPTIONAL for implementations to check the integrity of the
    URI/resource mapping when sending, receiving or processing "ni"
    URIs.
  </t>


<!--
Took this out in response to durst review.

		  <t> 

The query segment of a URI is NOT hierarchical. Thus escape encoding of slash
'/' characters is NOT required. Note that application code often attempts to
enforce such encoding, and RFC 3896 requires decoders to recognize the use of
URI escape encoding (e.g., '%2f' or '%2F' for the slash character).  Section
3.4 of <xref target="RFC3986"/> states that "The characters slash ("/") and
question mark ("?") may represent data within the query component." All of this
is as per RFC 3986, and should anything here conflict with that, RFC 3986 rules
apply.

          </t>
-->

<!--
<t>
Note that when mapped to HTTP or HTTPS URLs, it might be advisable to
percent encode '/' and '?' characters in the query
string.
</t>
-->

		<!--
		<t>[[The above is maybe ambiguous, 'cause we're not sure of what's right.
		Is it better to say "decoders MUST treat %2f as /" or that they MUST NOT 
		do that, or that the world's a nasty place so you just need to know when
		to do which?]]</t>
		-->

		<!--
          <t>
            Consequently no special escaping mechanism is required for the
            query parameter portion of ni URIs. URI escaping is however frequently
            imposed automatically by scripting environments. Thus to
            ensure interoperability, implementations SHOULD NOT generate URIs that
            employ URI character escaping, and implementations MUST NOT reject any
            URIs that employ URI character escaping.
          </t>
		-->

	<t>

Escaping of characters follows the rules in RFC 3986. This means that
%-encoding is used to distinguish between reserved and unreserved
functions of the same character in the same URI component. As an
example, an ampersand ('&') is used in the query part to separate
attribute-value pairs; an ampersand in a value therefore has to be
escaped as '%26'. Note that the set of reserved characters differs for
each component, as an example, a slash ('/') does not have any reserved
function in a query part and therefore does not have to be escaped.
However, it can still appear escaped as '%2f' or '%2F', and
implementations have to be able to understand such escaped forms.
Also note that any characters outside those allowed in the respective
URI component have to be escaped.

	</t>

	

	<!-- 
		<t>Old way:</t>
        <t>
          The Named Information URI has the following syntax:
        </t>
		<figure title="ni Name syntax" anchor="fig_abnfo">
		<artwork type="abnf" align="center">

      val = 1*unreserved
      unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
		</artwork>
		</figure>
	-->

<t>
   The Named Information URI adapts the URI definition from the URI
   Generic Syntax <xref target="RFC3986"/>.  We start with the base URI production:
</t>

		<figure title="URI syntax" anchor="fig_uri">
		<artwork type="abnf" align="center">

URI = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
    ; from RFC 3986

<t>
   Adapting that for the Named Information URI:
</t>

	<!-- another version bites the dust;-)
		<figure title="ni Name syntax" anchor="fig_niabnf_dust">
		<artwork type="abnf" align="center">

		<figure title="ni Name syntax" anchor="fig_niabnf">

		</figure>



		<t>

The "val" field MUST contain the output of base64url encoding the result of
applying the hash function ("alg") to its defined input, which defaults to the
object bytes that are expected to be returned when the URI is dereferenced. 

		</t>

	<t> 

Relative ni URIs can occur. In such cases, the algorithm in <xref
target="RFC3986"/> Section 5 applies. As an example, in Figure 5, the absolute
URI for "this third document" is "ni://example.com/sha-256-128;...".

The authority field in an ni URI is not quite the same as that from an HTTP
URL, even though the same values (e.g. DNS names) may be usefully used in both.
For an ni URI, the authority does not control nearly as much of the structure
of the "right hand side" of the URI. With ni URIs we also define standard query
string attributes and of cousrse have a strictly defined way to include the
hash value.

Internationalisation of strings within ni names is handled

          <t>

The semantics of a digest being used to establish a secure reference from an
authenticated source to an external source may be a function of associated meta
data such as the content type. 
The Content Type "ct" parameter specifies the MIME Content Type of the
associated data as defined in <xref target="RFC4288"/>. See <xref
target="iana-ni-param"/> for the associated IANA registry for ni parameter
names.
as shown in <xref target="fig-ct"/>. Implementations of
this specification MUST support parsing the ct= query string attribute name.

	</t>

<figure anchor="fig-ct" title="Example ni URI with Content Type">
<artwork align="center">
<![CDATA[
ni:///sha-256-32;f4OxZQ?ct=text/plain
]]></artwork></figure>

	<t>

Protocols making use of ni URIs will need to specify how to verify name-data
integrity for the MIME Content Types that they need to process and will need to
take into account possible Content-Transfer-Encodings and other aspects of MIME
encoding.

  </t>

	<t>

Implementations of this specification SHOULD support name-data integrity
validation for at least the application/octet-stream Content Type with no
Content-Transfer-Encoding (which is equivalent to binary or 8bit).  Additional
Content Types and Content-Transfer-Encodings can of course also be supported,
but are OPTIONAL.

	</t>

	<t>

If a) the user agent is sensitive to the Content Type and b) the ni name used
has a ct= query string attribute and c) the object is retrieved (from a server)
using a protocol that specifies a Content Type, then, if the two Content Types
match, all is well. If, in this situation, the Content Types do not match, then
the client SHOULD ignore the Content Type received from the server and use that
from the ni name, or handle that situation as a potential security error.
Content Type matching rules are defined in <xref target="RFC2045"/> Section 5.1.

	</t>

        </section>


</section>

<section title=".well-known URL Format">

		<t>
We define a mapping between URIs following the ni URI scheme and HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> or
HTTPS <xref target="RFC2617"/> URLs that makes use of the .well-known URI <xref target="RFC5785"/> by defining an
"ni" suffix (see <xref target="IANACons"/>).
  </t>

    <t>
The HTTP(S) mapping MAY be used in any context where clients with
support for ni URIs are not available.
    </t>

	<t>

Since the .well-known name-space is not intended for general
information retrieval, if an application de-references a .well-known/ni URL via
HTTP(S), then it will often receive a 3xx HTTP re-direction response.  A server
responding to a request for a .well-known/ni URL will often therefore return a 3xx
response and a client sending such a request MUST be able to handle that, as
should any fully compliant HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> client.

	</t>

<t>

For an ni name of the form "ni://n-authority/alg;val?query-string" the
corresponding HTTP(S) URL produced by this mapping is
"http://h-authority/.well-known/ni/alg/val?query-string", where "h-authority"
is derived as follows: If the ni name has a specified authority (i.e., the
n-authority is non-empty) then the h-authority MUST have the same value.  If
the ni name has no authority specified (i.e. the n-authority string is empty),
a h-authority value MAY be derived from the application context.  For example,
if the mapping is being done in the context of a web page then the origin <xref
target="RFC6454"/> for that web site can be used.  Of course, there are in
general no guarantees that the object named by the ni URI will be available via
the corresponding HTTP(S) URL.  But in the case that any data is returned, the
retriever can determine whether or not it is content that matches the ni URI.

</t>

<t>
If an application is presented with a HTTP(S) URL with "/.well-known/ni/"
as the start of its pathname component, then the reverse mapping to an
ni URI either including or excluding the authority might produce an ni URI
that is meaningful, but there is no guarantee that this will be the
case.
</t>

<t>
When mapping from an ni URI to a .well-known URL, an implementation will
have to decide between choosing an "http" or "https" URL. If the object
referenced does in fact match the hash in the URL, then there is arguably
no need for additional data integrity, if the ni URI or .well-known URL
was received "securely." However TLS also provides confidentiality, so
there can still be reasons to use the "https" URL scheme even in this
case. 
Additionally, web server policy such as 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-websec-strict-transport-sec"/> 
may dictate that data
might only be available over "https".

In general however, whether to use "http" or "https" is something
that needs to be decided by the application.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="url-frag" title="URL Segment Format">

<t>

Some applications may benefit from using hashes in existing HTTP URLs or other
URLs. To do this one simply uses the "alg-val" production from the ni name
scheme ABNF which may be included for example in the pathname, query string or
even fragment components of HTTP URLs <xref target="RFC2616"/>. In such cases
there is nothing present in the URL that ensures that a client can depend on
compliance with this specification, so clients MUST NOT assume that any URL
with a pathname component that matches the "alg-val" production was in fact
produced as a result of this specification. That URL might or might not be
related to this specification, only the context will tell.

</t>

</section>

<section anchor="binary-format" title="Binary Format">

<t>If a more space-efficient version of the name is needed, the following
binary format can be used.  The binary format name consists of two fields:
a header and the hash value. The header field defines
  how the identifier has been created and the hash value contains a
  (possibly truncated) result of a one-way hash over whatever is being
  identified by the hash value. The binary format of 
  a name is shown in <xref

<t> The hash algorithm and truncation length are specified by the Suite
ID. For maintaining efficient encoding for the binary format,
only a few hash algorithms and truncation lengths are supported. See
<xref target="IANAbin"/> for details.</t>  

	<t>

A hash value that is truncated to 120 bits will 
result in the overall name being a 128-bit value which may be
useful for protocols that can easily use 128-bit identifiers.

</section>

<section anchor="nihsyntax" title="Human-speakable Format">

  <t> 

Sometimes a name may need to be referred to in a format that is easy or unambiguous
for humans to read out, for example, over the phone.
The ni URI format is not very suited for this, as, for example, base64url uses
both upper and lower case which can easily cause confusion.  For this
particular purpose, ("speaking" the value of an ni URI) the following more
verbose but less ambiguous (when spoken) URI format is defined with scheme name
"nih", standing for "Named Information for Humans." (Or possibly "Not Invented
Here," which is clearly false, and therefore worth including :-) Note that nih
URIs are not intended for general uses, but only for this specific use-case. 

</t>

<t>

The justification for using a URI scheme for this is that that might help a
user agent for the speaker to better display the value, or perhaps if there was
some use-case for a machine to speak the value.  We do not include the query
string since there is no way to ensure that its value might be spoken
unambiguously, and similarly for the authority, where e.g. internationalised
forms of domain name could not be usefully spoken.  This leaves the hash value
as the only part of the ni URI that we feel can be usefully included. But since
speakers or listeners (or speech recognition) may err, we also include a
check-digit to catch common errors.

</t>


  <t> 

Fields in nih URIs are separated by a semi-colon (;) character. The first field
is a hash algorithm string, as in the ni URI format.  The hash value is
represented using lower-case ASCII hex characters, for example an octet with
the decimal value 58 (0x3A) is encoded as '3a'. This is the same as base16
encoding as defined in RFC 4648 <xref target="RFC4648"/> except using
lower-case letters.

</t>

<t> 

The hash value is OPTIONALLY followed by a semi-colon ';' then a checkdigit.
The checkdigit MUST be calculated using Luhn's mod N algorithm (with N=16) as
defined in <xref target="ISOIEC7812"/>, (see also
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_mod_N_algorithm). The input to the
calculation is the ASCII-HEX encoded hash value (i.e. "val" in the ABNF
production below). This  maps the ASCII-HEX so that
'0'=0,...'9'=9,'a'=10,...'f'=15. None of the other fields are input when
calculating the checkdigit.

</t>

<figure title="Human-speakable syntax" anchor="fig_human_dig">
		<artwork type="abnf" align="center">
humanname  = "nih:" alg-val [ ";" checkdigit ]
alg        = 1*unreserved
val        = 1*unreserved
checkdigit = unreserved
		</artwork>
  </figure>

  <t> For algorithms that have a Suite ID reserved (see <xref
  target="fig-ids"/>), the alg field MAY contain the ID value as a
  ASCII encoded decimal number instead of the hash name string (for
  example, "3" instead of "sha-256-120"). Implementations MUST be able
  to match the decimal ID values for the algorithms and hash lengths
  that they support even if they do not support the binary
  format. 
  </t>

	<t> 

There is no such thing as a relative nih URI.

	</t>

      <section title="Examples">

          <t>
            The following ni URI is generated from the text
            "Hello World!" (without the quotes, being 12 characters),

	<section anchor="IANAbin" title="ni Hash Algorithm Registry">

	  <t> 

IANA is requested to create a new registry for hash algorithms as used in the
name formats specified here and called the "ni Hash Algorithm Registry".
Future assignments are to be made through Expert Review <xref
target="RFC5226"/>.  This registry has five fields, the suite ID, the hash
algorithm name string, the truncation length, the underlying algorithm
reference and a status field that indicates if algorithm is current or
deprecated and should no longer be used.  The status field can have the value
"current" or "deprecated".  Other values are reserved for possible future
definition.

</t>

<t>

If the status is "current", then that does not necessarily mean that
the algorithm is "good" for any particular purpose, since the cryptographic
strength requirements will be set by other applications or protocols.  

</t>

<!-- SM comment
<t>

The Designated Expert MUST allow for IETF review before approving a request to mark an
entry as "deprecated." Such requests may simply take the form of a mail to the
Designated Expert (an RFC is not required).  IETF review can be achieved if the
Designated Expert sends a mail to the IETF discussion list. At least two weeks
for comments MUST be allowed thereafter before the request is approved and
actioned.

</t>
-->

<t>

A request to mark an entry as "deprecated" can be done by sending
a mail to the Designated Expert.  Before approving the request,
the community MUST be consulted via a "call for comments" of
at least two weeks by sending a mail to the IETF discussion list.

</t>

<t>


Initial values are specified below.  The Designated Expert SHOULD
generally approve additions that reference hash algorithms that are widely used
in other IETF protocols. In addition, the Designated Expert SHOULD NOT accept
additions where the underlying hash function (with no truncation) is
considered weak for collisions. Part of the reasoning behind this
last point is that inclusion of code for weak hash functions, e.g.

The suite ID field ("ID") can be empty, or can have values between
0 and 63, inclusive.  Because there are only 64 possible values, this
field is OPTIONAL (leaving it empty if omitted).
Where the
binary format is not expected to be used for a given hash algorithm, this field
SHOULD be omitted. If an entry is registered without a suite ID, the Designated Expert MAY
allow for later allocation of a suite ID, if that appears warranted. 
The Designated Expert MAY consult the community via a "call for
comments" by sending a mail to the IETF discussion list before
allocating a suite ID.

      <section title="Creation of ni parameter registry" anchor="iana-ni-param">

        <t>

IANA is requested to create 
          a new registry entitled "Named Information URI
          Parameter Definitions".

        </t>

        <t>

The policy for future assignments to the registry is Expert Review, and as for
the ni Hash Algorithm Registry above, the Designated Expert is responsible
for ensuring that the document referenced for the paramater definition meets
the "specification required" rule." 

        </t>

	<t>

The fields in this registry are the parameter name, a description and a
reference. The parameter name MUST be such that it is suitable for
use as a query string parameter name in an ni URI.

	</t>

        <t>

The initial contents of the registry are:

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec_cons">
        <t>
          No secret information is required to
          generate or verify a name of the form described here. Therefore
          a name like this can only provide evidence for the integrity for the
          referenced object and the proof of integrity provided is 
          only as good as the proof of integrity for the name from which
	 	  we started.
          In other words, the hash value can provide 
		  a name-data integrity binding between the name 
		  and the
		  bytes returned when the name is de-referenced
		  using some protocol.
        </t>

        <t>
          Disclosure of a name value does not necessarily 
          entail disclosure of the referenced object but may enable
          an attacker to determine the contents of the referenced object
          by reference to a search engine or other data repository or,
			for a highly formatted object with little variation, 
		by simply guessing the value and checking if the digest
			value matches. So the fact that these names contain 
		hashes does not protect the confidentiality of the
		object that was input to the hash.
        </t>

        <t>
          The integrity of the referenced content would be compromised if
          a weak hash function were used. SHA-256 is
		currently our preferred hash algorithm which is why we've 
		only added SHA-256 based suites to the initial IANA registry.
        </t>

        <t>

		  If a truncated hash value is used, certain security properties will
be affected.  In general a hash algorithm is designed to produce sufficient
bits to prevent a 'birthday attack' collision occurring. To ensure that the
difficulty of discovering two pieces of content that result in the same digest
with a work factor O(2^x) by brute force requires a digest length of 2x.  Many
security applications only require protection against a 2nd pre-image attack
which only requires a digest length of x to achieve the same work factor.
Basically, the shorter the hash value used, the less security benefit you can
possibly get.

        </t>

		<t>

An important thing to keep in mind is not to make the mistake of thinking two
names are the same when they aren't. For example, a name with a 32 bit
truncated sha-256 hash is not the same as a name with the full 256 bits of hash
output, even if the hash value for one is a prefix of that for the other.

		</t>

		<t>

The reason for this is that if an application treats those as the same name
then that might open up a number of attacks. For example, if I publish an object
with the full hash, then I probably (in general) don't want some other
application to treat a name with just the first 32 bits of that as referring to
the same thing, since the 32 bit name will have lots of colliding objects. If
ni or nih URIs become widely used, there will be many cases where names will occur more than
once in application protocols, and it'll be unpredictable which instance of the
name would be used for name-data integrity checking, leading to threats.
For this reason, we require that the algorithm, length and value all 
match before we consider two names to be the same.

		</t>
	<t>

The fact that an ni URI includes a domain name in the authority field by
itself implies nothing about the relationship between the owner of the domain
name and any content referenced by that URI. 
While a name-data integrity service can be provided using ni URIs,
that does not in any sense validate the authority part of the name.
For example, there is nothing to stop anyone creating an ni URI
containing a hash of someone else's content.  Application developers
MUST NOT assume any relationship between the registrant of the domain
name that is part of an ni URI and some matching content just because
the ni URI matches that content.

	</t>

	<t>

If name-data integrity is successfully validated, and the hash is strong and
long enough, then the "web origin" <xref target="RFC6454"/> for the bytes of
the named object is really going to be the place from which you got the ni name
and not the place from which you got the bytes of the object. This appears to
offer a potential benefit if using ni names for, for example, scripts included
from a HTML page accessed via server-authenticated https.  If name-data
integrity is not validated (and it is optional), or fails, then the web origin
is, as usual, the place from which the object bytes were received. Applications
making use of ni names SHOULD take this into account in their trust models.

	</t>

	<t>

Some implementations might mis-handle ni URIs that include
non-base64 characters, whitespace or other non-conforming strings and
that could lead to erroneously considering names to be the same when
they are not. An ni URI that is malformed in such ways MUST NOT be
treated as matching any other ni URI. Implementers need to check the
behaviour of libraries for such parsing problems.

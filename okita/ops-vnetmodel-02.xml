			<t> Virtual switches on server virtualization platforms cause a
				problem in managing data center networks containing several hundred
				switches. Accordingly, a management information model for the
				network structure of data center networks containing virtual
				switches is proposed. The proposed model consists of a physical
				layer (which represents connections between physical switches) and a
				virtual layer (which represents connections between virtual
				switches). These layers also represent the association of the
				virtual switch with the corresponding physical switch. The model
				shortens the virtual LAN (VLAN) configuration time taken by
				operators of data center networks by a maximum of 35%. This
				result shows that the proposed model is effective in reducing the
				management time of data center networks containing virtual switches.

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t> In data center networks, a virtual switch on a
				server virtualization platform works as a virtual network element
				<xref target="VEB" />
				<xref target="EVB-PAR" />
				<xref target="PE-PAR" />
				.
				The virtual switch connects multiple virtual machines on the same
				server virtualization platform and connects these virtual machines
				to external physical switches.</t>
			<t> Virtual switches, however, cause a problem in managing
				data center networks because, mainly, a virtual switch and a
				physical switch require different management systems. Operators of
				data center networks therefore have to use multiple management
				systems for managing the whole data center network.</t>
			<t>To avoid this management difficulty, an integrated
				network management system (NMS) is effective. The integrated NMS
				collects and stores virtual-network management information that
				describes network structure of a managed target network. It then
				displays or transmits this management information as a response to a
				request from operators or other NMSs.</t>
			<t> The purpose of this document is to provide a
				management information model that represents the network structure
				of a data center containing virtual switches. Section 2 describes
				the model requirements, Section 3 describes the relationships to 
				the existing MIBs, Section 4 defines the model, and Section 5
				evaluates the model.</t>

			<section title="Problem Statement">
				<t>Virtual switches cause a difficulty in managing
					data center networks. They expand the data center network into the
					server virtualization platforms. Therefore, to manage the whole
					network structure of data center networks, network operators have
					to manage virtual switches in addition to physical switches.</t>
				<t> To manage these virtual and physical switches, operators have to
					use multiple management interfaces. Specifically, to manage virtual
					switches, they have to use a specific management system for the
					server virtualization platform that the target virtual switches are
					created on. Moreover, to manage physical switches, they use a
					network management system. Figure 1 shows an architectural overview
					of a conventional data center network management system.</t>

				<t>This conventional management architecture causes the

				<t> The following three types of elements exist around this VNMS.</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t> User clients or traditional NMS</t>
						<t> Network switches</t>
						<t> Server virtualization platforms</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>The user client or network application uses management
					information about device connections in the managed network. The
					network switches are virtualized as multiple virtual switches.
					Moreover, the server virtualization platforms are virtualized as
					multiple virtual machines and internal virtual switches. A set of
					virtual switches and virtual machines forms a virtual system for a
					user.</t>
				<t> Among the elements described above, we define the following two
					management interfaces.</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t> Network Management Interface (NMI)</t>
						<t> Device Management Interface (DMI)</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t> The network management interface (NMI) is set between the
					network application and the VNMS. This
					interface is used by the VNMS to transport
					virtual-network management information to network applications in
					response to their request.</t>
				<t> Datamodels provide the definition and format of the virtual-network 
				  management information transported on the NMI. The definition 
				  describes an encoding scheme and an underlying transport protocol. 
				  The VNMS may use, for example, SNMP (Simple Network Management 
				  Protocol) and MIB (Management Information Base) specified in the 
				  Internet-standard management framework [RFC3410] or an XML-based 
				  management framework [RFC3535] as the datamodel.</t>
				<t> The device-management interface (DMI) is set between the
					VNMS and network devices, which include the
					server virtualization platforms and network switches. The DMI is
					used by the VNMS to query management
					information about a target device. This interface is device
					specific and not standardized by this document.</t>

		<!-- Section3  -->
		<section title="Relationships to Existing MIBs">
			<t>
				A lot of RFCs about MIBs have been published from the IETF.
				These existing MIBs provide each information models implicitly.
				For avoiding inventing the wheel, we researched relationships 
				between the requirements for the virtual network management 
				information model and existing MIBs.</t>
			
			<!-- Section3.1 -->
			<section title="Relationships to LLDP-MIB">
				<t>
					Protocols for network topology discovery like Link Layer 
					Discovery Protocol (LLDP) use some of MIB modules. 
					These MIB modules are used to describe link state information 
					in the managed network. For example, the LLDP-MIB 
					<xref target="IEEE.802-1AB.2005" />
					standardized as 
					IEEE Standard 802.1AB supports this function.</t>
				<t>
					The LLDP-MIB can be used to describe a connection between 
					neighboring layer-2 MAC bridges. In the LLDP-MIB, there is an 
					lldpRemTable which contains one or more rows per physical 
					network connection. The row contains a chassis ID, a port ID, 
					a port description, and system information for each neighboring 
					layer-2 MAC bridge.</t>
				<t>
					As described above, the LLDP-MIB can be used to describe the 
					connection information between physical entities like physical 
					switches. However, the LLDP-MIB cannot be used to describe the 
					connection information between logical entities. Thus, it cannot 
					be used to describe the connection information between a virtual 
					switch and a virtual machine on the same physical server.
					Moreover, it cannot be used to describe the connection information 
					between a virtual switch and an external physical switch.</t>
				<t>
					As the result, the LLDP-MIB does not satisfy the first requirement 
					in section 2.3 for the virtual network management information model.</t>
			</section>
			
			<!-- Section3.2 -->
			<section title="Relationships to ENTITY-MIB">
				<t>
					The ENTITY-MIB
					<xref target="RFC2737" />
					was published by the IETF entmib WG.
					It can be used to represent a single SNMP agent which supports 
					multiple instances of one MIB. For example, a single physical 
					switch having a single SNMP agent can support multiple instances 
					of a bridge with the ENTITY-MIB.
				</t>
				<t>
					The ENTITY-MIB can be used to describe following two types of 
					information.
				</t>
				<t>
					One is mapping information between logical entities and physical 
					entities on one network element. The information can be represented 
					by the entLPMappingTable and the entAliasMappingTable in the 
					entityMapping group. For example, these tables support logical 
					entities which contain OSPF instances and 802.1d bridges.
					Moreover, these tables support physical entities which contain bridge 
					ports, backplanes and chassis.
				</t>
				<t>
					Another is information about hierarchy relationship among physical 
					entities. The information can be represented by the 
					entPhysicalContainsTable in the entityMapping group. 
					The entPhysicalContainsTable contains simple mapping information 
					between 'container' entity and 'containee' entity. For example, 
					a chassis is a 'container' entity. Its bridge ports and its 
					backplane are 'containee' entities.
				</t>
				<t>
					As described above, the ENTITY-MIB can be used to describe the mapping 
					information between logical entities and physical entities. Therefore, 
					the ENTITY-MIB satisfies  the second requirement in section 2.3 for 
					the virtual network management information model.
				</t>
				<t>
					However, the ENTITY-MIB cannot be used to describe the connection 
					information between logical entities. For example, it is impossible to 
					describe connection information between virtual switches with the ENTITY-MIB.
				</t>
				<t>
					As the result, the ENTITY-MIB does not satisfy the first requirement 
					in section 2.3 for the virtual network management information model.
				</t>

		<section title="Proposals of Virtual Network Management Information Model">
			<t>
				This section defines the proposed virtual-network management 
				information model, which is an object-oriented information model. 
				The model can satisfy both of the requirements included in section 
				2.3. The model is an abstract-information model independent from 
				encoding schemes and management protocols. The model is written in 
				Unified Modeling Language (UML)
				<xref target="UML" />
				.
			</t>
			<section title="TargetedNetwork Object">
				<t>The proposed model starts with a TargetedNetwork object. This
					object represents the overall network. In the network, two types of
					network exist: a physical network and a virtual network. In the
					proposed model, a PhysicalNetwork object represents a physical
					network, and a VirtualNetwork object represents a virtual network.
					To represent this structure, the TargetedNetwork object has one or
					multiple references to PhysicalNetwork objects and VirtualNetwork
					objects.</t>
				<t>Furthermore, the PhysicalNetwork object and the
					VirtualNetwork have a reference between them. Since a physical
					network can create multiple virtual networks, the PhysicalNetwork
					object can have multiple references to corresponding VirtualNetwork
					objects. On the contrary, the VirtualNetwork object has only one
					reference to the PhysicalNetwork object, since the virtual network
					is created on the specific physical network.</t>

		<section title="Experiment">
			<section title="Environment">
				<t> To confirm the applicability of the proposed model, a
					virtual network management system, deployed with virtual network
					information based on the proposed information model, was developed.
					This system stores configuration information of the managed network
					and displays the contents of this information via a command line
					interface. Operators can confirm the network structure with this
					system.</t>
				<t> In the experiment using the virtual network management system,
					operators made a virtual LAN (VLAN) configuration of switches in
					sample networks with and without the integrated NMS. The operation
					time for each VLAN configuration operation was evaluated.</t>
				<t> Two sample networks containing multiple virtual machines were
					used. One of the networks corresponds to a small private network.
					The other corresponds to a medium-sized enterprise network. Table 1
					lists the parameters of these sample networks.</t>

				<t> The sample network in example 1 consisted of an external
					physical switch, two internal physical switches, and four server
					blades in two blade-server chassis. Each server blade ran a
					server virtualization platform. The internal switches connected the
					two blades in the chassis, and the external switch connected these
					two internal switches. Each virtualization platform operated two
					virtual machines. On these server virtualization platforms, virtual
					switches connected an external physical switch and multiple virtual
					machines on the same platform .</t>
				<t> The sample network in example 2 consisted of four external
					switches, four internal switches, fourteen server blades in a
					four-blade server chassis. Each server blade ran a
					server virtualization platform, each of which operated one or two
					virtual machines. And four physical switches worked as an external
					gateway switch, a core switch, and two edge switches connected to a
					server virtualization platform.</t>
				<t> Figure 6 shows the virtual-network management information of the
					network used in example 1. Here, "VM" and "VSW" stand for a virtual
					machine and a virtual switch created on a server virtualization
					platform. PhysicalLink objects and VirtualLink objects
					are omitted to help readability.</t>

					reduced VLAN configuration time by 35%. It took 676 seconds
					for the operator to make the VLAN configuration by adding a virtual

				<t> While performing the VLAN-configuration operation without the

					the network.</t>
				<t> In contrast, while performing the operation with the
					virtual-network management system, the operators could read all the
					required management information from the management interface of

		<section title="Summary">
			<t>This document proposes a management information model for a
				virtual network in a data center network. This information model can
				represent the network structure of a virtual network composed of
				virtual switches and physical switches. It can also represent the
				mapping between the virtual switch and the physical switch.</t>
			<t>The network management system, which manages virtual-network
				management information according to the proposed information model,
				reduced VLAN configuration time by 35%. This result
				demonstrates that the virtual-network management information model
				is effective in reducing the management time of a data center
				network containing virtual switches.</t>
			<t>
				The proposed management information model does not contain
				implementation specifications. Therefore, to implement the
				information model, developers have to select an encoding scheme and
				a management protocol for transporting management information data.
				For example, developers can use SNMP and MIB specified in the
				Internet-standard management framework
				<xref target="RFC3410" />
				or an XML
				<xref target="W3C.REC-xml" />
				-based management framework
				<xref target="RFC3535" />
			</t>

		<section title="Security Considerations">
			<t> The virtual-network management information as defined in this
				document provides administrative information about a data center
				network. This information could be used to aid an attack on the
				network.</t>
			<t> It is assumed that accesses to the data defined in this document
				are subject to appropriate access control in the network management
				system.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="IANA Considerations">
			<t>The document does not request any IANA action, since the
				proposed model is an abstract information model. However, a concrete
				data model based on this information model should request IANA
				actions if necessary.</t>

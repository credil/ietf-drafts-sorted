Internet-Draft              VWRAP Client Caps                 March 2010


1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  overview

   This note defines the use of "Client" side capabilities within the
   VWRAP specifications.  Client Capabilities are Capabilities, as
   defined by the VWRAP specifications, on the client or virtual worlds
   viewer.

   Client side capabilities will often represent resources hosted on
   devices and systems behind firewalls, and will thus be accessed via
   event queues are similar mechanisms.  This note defines patterns for
   using client side capabilities, and an URI scheme for addressing such
   capabilities.  A fairly complete worked example is provided.  The
   exact LLSD, the exact URI formats, and the example service are
   provided to illustrate the service pattern, and are extremely
   provisional.  The sequence diagrams used to illustrate the flows, as
   well as the structural diagrams represent one possible approach to
   implementing the service pattern.  Nothing beyond the interfaces
   would be normative.  This note is an informational draft.  It is very
   preliminary and is intended to drive discussion.

   Questions of note:

   1.  How much run time / latency cost is associated with this design?
       As we move things from UDP to client side caps, what are the
       performance implications for the client?

   2.  This design is intended to permit the substitution of r-http,
       websockets, or xmpp or similar transports in the architecture.
       How close do we come to that ideal?

   3.  Will this model fit well with the security and trust policy model
       being contemplated for VWRAP?

   4.  Do we really want to specify that requests to the client should
       be valid on 'any' event queue pipe??  For instance, if I am an
       untrusted region, maybe I do not want to service a request for
       friendship.  Maybe i don't trust the region enough to take
       friendship requests, maybe i only want to accept them from my
       nice safe trusted agentd.

   5.  Is everything in the eventq uri needed?  The viewer wouldn't be
       servicing requests for other agents

   6.  Why is host_end_cap specified the way it is?  Why is it not just
       a URI like it is today?

   7.  Are we missing any key requirements here?


3.  Motivation

   The VWRAP specifications derive much of their initial structure from
   the design patterns embodied in Linden Lab(TM)'s Second Life(Tm)
   virtual world service.  This service has been characterized by a
   fairly straightforward deployment pattern, where services are
   clustered and facaded behind large, unitary interfaces.

   In a facaded model it is easy to manage message routing.  From the
   client's perspective, all traffic terminates in the facade.  There is
   an event queue or a two way pipe, and the client accepts asynchronous
   traffic from any services within the facade from that message source.
   The facade pattern hides any internal routing within the service
   deployment.  There may be internal routing occurring, but the client
   is kept unaware of these issues.

   The VWRAP specifications describe a set of services.  When those
   services are decomposed into multiple deployment patterns, the
   question of how a given service can delivery asynchronous information
   to another service or client becomes cogent.

   The "caps granting" pattern makes it straight forward to return a cap
   to a separate service.  A client may contact the seed cap granter at
   a URI and be handed a URI to a service hosted on a separate server
   and indeed a service which is not even hosted by the cap granter.
   Services returned by a single caps grant may span trust and
   administrative domains.  When these services need to deliver
   asynchronous messages the routing problem becomes clear.

   The second motivation for this work is managing pairwise addition and
   evolution of protocols.  The current design assumes that the "client"
   is a unitary, process with a deep understanding of the expected
   services available on the servers.  As the VWRAP specification grow,
   and we build and explore various ways of delivering services, we will
   want to allow new services to be described, and we will almost
   certainly find the current client approach limiting.  Having an
   explicit way of saying "For this service, please route notification
   to this endpoint" allows people to easily build a range of possible
   client side structures including ones which are different than

Internet-Draft              VWRAP Client Caps                 March 2010


   current clients.

   These two sets of motivations drive a desire to explicitly model the
   service deployment and client deployment model in a way that allows a
   dynamic association between the services.


4.  Requirements

   This note addresses the following requirements for service/client
   modeling in VWRAP:

   1.  Support deploying services across arbitrary domain and hosting
       models In particular, permit services to be deployed across
       multiple hosts within a domain, clustering pipes, and securely
       sharing event queues and event delivery.

   2.  Abstract away a specific single bidirectional pipe from the VWRAP
       specs Support event queues, r-http if it becomes a common
       pattern, websockets, if they become common, and full duplex
       schemes, such as xmpp, if they become viable

   3.  Provide a model for architecturally describing resources on the
       client.  This, in effect, is "addressing" client side resources,
       providing references to them.

   4.  Permit service side deployers to pass around references to these
       client side resources within the service cloud safely and
       transparently

   5.

       *  Prevent services from spoofing messages to resources others
          than those they have been granted access to

       *  Provide a endpoint independent path to the client (via any
          eventq available, or any URI representing the client resource)

       *  Preventing guessing of endpoint resource addresses

   6.  Closely model the current event queue implementations

   Support deploying services on multiple domains and hosting models
   Virtual worlds have a wide range of deployment patterns, and require
   a broad range of services, with different computational profiles.  We
   want to enable people to delegate services to arbitrary servers.
   This should enable clouds to host services, and permit deployers to
   choose deployment models which meet their needs.  Abstracting away

   specific pipes This is the single largest driver.  We want to divorce
   the VWRAP specifications from the current Linden Lab event queue
   implementation, the UDP pipes, and any single approach to delivering
   bits to the client.  VWRAP aspires to support virtual worlds over a
   period of multiple years.  We assume that the pipes to clients will
   evolve over time.  Creating a web services, URI addressed approach to
   managing connections to regions, is a powerful way to de-couple
   transport choices from protocol handlers.


5.  Options

   There are basically two broad strokes of options and then severl
   variations.  In all of the options for solving this set of
   requirements, we need to allow the client and a set of servcies
   determine how to wire each other together in the face of possible
   transports.  In particular, we need to signal to the client if it
   needs to take specific actions to permit servcies to signal it, and
   services, the actions they may need to take as well.

   Currently, services simply chose to use either UDP or the eventq
   managed by the region to access the client.  The client is forced to
   assume a message might come over either pipe.  This exposes the
   client to complexity, and open up potential security exposures, if an
   attack is delivered over an unexpected channel.  The notion of
   listening on all possible channesl also becomes problematic as
   additional possible channels become available, such as websockets, or
   xmpp.

   The broad stroke options are to either have an asynchronous pipe for
   each service of cluster of facaded services, or to permit one or more
   aynchronous pipe to proxy for other services.  Note that aynchronous
   pipe might be an event queue, a websocket connection, or other
   appropriate transport.  In any of these cases, the question will
   devolve onto either sharing some connectoin(s) or having a single
   connectoin per service/Service facade.  (A faceded servie collection
   is effectively sharing an event path, it merely hides it in the
   details of its implementation.  Servcies aggregated by a single
   provider can easily facade in this fashion, although potentially at
   he cost of creating bottlenecks.  Aggregatign services provided by
   multiple provdiers exposes trust and API boundaries.


6.  Rest/Caps style model for client resources

   This represents one pattern which could address the requirements.
   One open question is whether simply permitting each service to create
   an event queue as needed is sufficient.

Internet-Draft              VWRAP Client Caps                 March 2010


   Once we want to model the client's resources separate from the
   communications pipes used to access those resources, we are faced
   with the problem of naming, and addressing those resources.  The
   current client, mostly assumes that it can parse from message type to
   determine where the message should be routed.  The overall
   justifications for using REST approaches are as cogent for the
   client, as any other portion of VWRAP.  The REST model affords a
   consistent approach to modeling resources


7.  One approach

   We approach the overall design as describing access to resources
   hosted by clients.  As many clients are inaccessible for full HTTP
   access from the services which wish to contact them, we describe the
   overall approach, in a way which permits event queues to be used in
   the current implementation, and approaches such as reverse-HTTP
   (Sometimes referred to as rhttp, r-http or ptth) in the future with
   no changes to the basic approach. (and ideally none to the code,
   beyond supporting r-http listeners.)  Named client side resources The
   major addition to the current model is that of addressable client
   side resources.  This effectively extends the REST/ Capabilities
   model to interactions involving sending data to the client.  Instead
   of sending them to the client as a single endpoint, we can route the
   data to specific endpoints managed by the client.  By using the basic
   REST model for manipulating these resources, we get a simple, well
   defined set of interactions between services and client side
   resources.


8.  A simple example (friendship)

   So, instead of embedding friendship inside a IM message, or even in a
   separate message, and requiring the client to parse the header and
   then route the message, we instead define a resource on the client,
   which is associated with friendship messages.  This resource is then
   passed to the service(s) which need to manipulate the resource.  The
   common case will be that services will post messages to the client,
   but we define the model generally so that services can invoke normal
   REST semantic operations on the resources.

   Exposing client side resources with an event queue

   Since the client cannot directly expose its resources, the client
   relies on event queues to fetch requests destined for these resources
   from services.  This is mediated via a COMET style event queue.  The
   client polls the service, and when there are requests destined for
   it, it collects those requests and routes them to the handlers which



Levine & Deffeyes       Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              VWRAP Client Caps                 March 2010


   process them.

   The requests contain the resource they are routed to, and the method
   to be invoked on the resource, as well as the payload of the request.


   <map>
   <key>sequence</key><int>sequence number</int>
   <key>resource</key><string>path of resource</string>
   <key>method</key><string>POST</string>
   <key>payload</key>{LLSD of payload}
   </map>

   Each request can be routed by the client side event queue to the
   desired handler.  Note the separate event queues sharing one map of
   resource to handlers, and delivering events to shared handlers.  Now,
   in order to complete this story, we need to describe how the services
   know what resources on the client they should post to, and how these
   resources are addressed.


9.  An eventq URI

   To support addressing client side resource reached event queues, we
   introduce an "eventq:" URI.
   eventq://client_id@fqdn_of_eventq_host/{path to resource} or
   eventqs://client_id@fqdn_of_eventq_host/{path to resource} For
   details on URI format, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme and
   more formally: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 We are describing a
   scheme "eventq" with hierarchical part broken into the traditional
   "authority" and "path" Our authority is addressed as "client_id@
   fqdn_of eventq_host" What this says is "for the unique client
   (client_id) you can route via an event queue hosted by the host
   listed as "fqdn_of_eventq_host" which will be a hostname.  To address
   the specif resource, on that client, you must provide the path.  The
   client_id, is a short term unique string representing the client,
   during this session with the services cloud.  This is provided to
   permit several important options.  First, it permits us to pass a
   capability with an eventq: URI to a service which already has a
   connection to the client, and allows the transport level software to
   understand it already has a connection to the client.  It also allows
   correct behavior in the face of an attempt to re-establish a
   connection to the eventq host, and finally, it allows services to
   chose *any* event queue it knows about which connects to the client
   for delivering it's requests to the client.  This allows a number of
   potential deployment patterns which permit scaling of the
   computational fabric with no changes to the client, or necessarily
   the services.  The eventqs scheme, is identical to the eventq scheme,

Internet-Draft              VWRAP Client Caps                 March 2010


   with the added requirement that the underlying event queue be
   implemented using https or an equally secure transport, so that
   messages cannot be intercepted, and there is a high degree of
   confidence that the host holding the service end of the eventq is the
   desired host.


10.  Putting it all together

   To actually use this plumbing, we need to associate the client side
   resource with the service which wishes to use it.  We incorporate
   this into the setup flow needed to use the resource.  The client/
   viewer requests a capability from a seed cap in the services network.
   (from initial login, or transitively from other caps) The service
   returns with a URI of the service side resource.  The client then
   creates a client side resource (or resources) for the service to use,
   and passes them up to the service, which then begins to issue
   requests against these resources.

   1.  Client/Viewer logs into a service and acquires one or more
       seedcaps

   2.  The client requests a set of capabilities from the seedcaps.

   3.  One or more of these capability requests includes an event queue

   4.  The client establishes the event queues, posting its "client_id"
       to the event queue host.

   5.  Zero or more of the capabilities requested use client side
       resources.  For these capabilties, the client creates and
       registers a client side resource, in the form of a client
       capability, composes a URI for the resources, and informs the
       service of the URIs of the client side resources.

   6.  The service side service begins posting requests on the
       associated event queues

   7.  The client routes the requests to the registered handlers.

   8.  We flow a response from the handler back to the invoker


11.  From login to a client cap delivered message

   A small worked example.  The actual service involved, and the
   deployment details of the service are purely notional.  Do not focus
   on the specific service messages, but the routing and setup flows

   which enable the messages to flow.


12.  Login/Auth initial cap grants

   This is pretty much VWRAP business as usual.  The client connects to
   the authentication service, and gets a seedcap, on an Agent Domain
   Service (n, one of many)

                   caps_granted(array of caps, URIs, of caps)


13.  Setting up an event queue

   Pretty straight forward.  We create a handler on the client, which
   calls the cap the client got from the login step.  There is one
   additional tidbit that flows at this point, which is that we get the
   Host end of our caps.  This fetches from the host side of the agent
   domain event queue, which we will use in our URIs.  XXX dummy needs
   explanation here.

   <key>host_end_cap</key>
   <string>fully.qualified.domain.com</string>
   </map>


14.  Wiring up the client side resource of a service

   The next step is the major addition to the sequence.  We take the cap
   for a service we requested earlier, and then create the client side

   handler, associate it with a client side resource, and pass that
   resource to the service side cap.[NOTE: this seems confusing, i think
   in part because I'm not sure who "we" is.  So it is hard to tell who
   is telling whom.  I think u know what you mean, but it's not coming
   across in the text.  Also, Is there a step where the client
   'advertises' what services it can provide on a specific event queue?
   And Does the server side 'ask' for a list of client side caps like
   the viewer asks for caps from the AD and region? ]

15.  Flowing a message to the handler

   Finally, with all the bits in place, the invoker can send an event,
   and expect it to get picked up at the far end by the handler.  XXX is
   this the AD handler, the friendship services handler, or do you mean
   the client eq handler??  This thing just aches for an actual diagram.
   XXX Our hypothetical message is:


   <map>
   <key>request_type</key>
   <string>friendship request</string>
   <key>user social name</key>
   <string> Hippo The Avatarian</string>
   <key>user uuid</key>
   <string>4509971b-b2f3-43a9-bc71-1736c971a8f7</string>
   <key>message</key>
   <string>Please be my friend, we met at the hippo wallow last week
   </string>
   </map>

   So, the Friendship services takes that payload, and the URI of the
   client's resource.  It is out of scope, how it posts the request to
   the service end of the event queue. (being a deployer issue, not part
   of the public spec) It passes the URI, and the payload, and it gets
   to the input hopper of the event queue, along with the method being
   invoked. (in this case "POST") The event queue then packages up the
   message as part of the array of messages it has bound to the client:
   XXX not quite sure why you need to state it is out of scope. plz
   explainie.

16.  Flowing a response

   No such resource: If there is no client side handler at the resource
   listed in the request the event queue handler flows back a 404
   responds per traditional http; XXX if we arent requiring http, do we
   need our own set of error codes defined?

   Successful responses When the client's friendship handler has
   accepted the request, it can post a response.  This can, of course,
   include simply accepting the request, and then posting an "accept
   friendship" message to the main cap, or accepting it directly,
   depending on the design of the friendship service.  We will do both,
   for illustrative purposes

   Simple OK

   For the simple, accepted response, the handler will post back to the
   event queue an OK.  (This is an internal flow, not part of the VWRAP
   architecture) and the event queue will then pass on the response to
   the invoker.  It Structurally, this is very similar to the request.
   The get() call will pass up responses for handling by the service
   side event queue.

   <integer>98726</integer>

   <key>response code</key>
   <integer>200</integer>
   <key>payload</key>
   </map>
   </map>
   </array>


17.  Passing back content

   The final case, is actually passing back content on a reply.  This
   merely adds the payload.

   The overall pattern and other URIs..  The overall pattern is intended
   to provide a framework for handling not just eventq: scheme URIs, but
   any URI which will successfully flow the data between the two
   services.  For this to work, the basic pattern, of setting a client
   side cap needs to keep in mind that the "eventq/eventqs" scheme is
   not the only URI which might be passed in the future.


18.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   If this specification progresses, a request to IANA to register the
   eventq scheme might be contemplated


19.  Security Considerations

   Event queues expose client side resources to messages from servers.
   The URI for eventq provides routing to these resources.  This exposes
   these resources to a number of possible attacks.  The use of
   capabilities, and the limitation that in order to access a client
   side capability, one has to have access to the host side of an event

   queue, eliminates most of the possible attacks.  The current
   capabilities specification uses a 128 bit UUID, generated for each
   session, for each capability, to make the resource portion of the
   capability essentially un-guessable.  This requires care in passing
   around capabilities, as if they are passed in plain text, they would
   be subject to sniffing, and if passed in open sessions, such as HTTP,
   they would be vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.  Control of
   the services side endpoint of event queues provides a separate means
   of limiting the security issues.  Nothing described here defines how
   the host end of an event queue is exposed to services.  Depending on
   the host implementation, the resource could be accessible broadly, or
   only to programs running in the address space of the event queue.  If
   the resource is made available broadly, the capability design limits
   the exposure of the resource to messages aimed at the actually
   resource, but opens up the event queue itself as a vehicle for denial
   of service attacks.

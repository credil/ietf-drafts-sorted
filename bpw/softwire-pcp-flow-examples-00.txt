Internet-Draft              PCP Flow Examples                  June 2010


1.  Introduction

   As a companion document to [I-D.wing-softwire-port-control-protocol],
   this document provides examples to help understanding the PCP
   machinery and exchanged PCP messages in various usage contexts.

   For more details about PCP protocol specification, the reader is
   invited to refer to [I-D.wing-softwire-port-control-protocol].

   Examples included in this document make use of the IPv4 and IPv6
   address blocks defined in [RFC5737] and [RFC3849] for documentation
   purposes.

1.1.  PCP Server Mapping Table

   The structure of the PCP Server mapping table when controlling a
   stateful NAT44 or NAT64 [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] is
   shown below.  Some information such as DSCP may not be supported.
   Internal IP addresses can be IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

                  +----------------------+-------------+
                  |                      | Entry Index |
                  +----------------------+-------------+
                  |       Client-ID      |             |
                  |  Transport Protocol  |             |
                  |  Internal IP Address |             |
                  | Internal Port Number |             |
                  |  External IP Address |             |
                  | External Port Number |             |
                  |     Internal DSCP    |             |
                  |     External DSCP    |             |
                  |       Lifetime       |             |
                  +----------------------+-------------+

   As for the DS-Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], the mapping
   table would be as follows:

                  |       Client-ID      |             |
                  |       Tunnel-ID      |             |
                  |  Transport Protocol  |             |
                  |  Internal IP Address |             |
                  | Internal Port Number |             |
                  |  External IP Address |             |
                  | External Port Number |             |
                  |     Internal DSCP    |             |
                  |     External DSCP    |             |
                  |       Lifetime       |             |
                  +----------------------+-------------+

   Tunnel-ID is an IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:DB8:0:0:1::1) of the B4
   element.

   Decimal and dotted-decimal values are used in the examples listed in
   the following sections.


2.  Create Mapping

   The following figure illustrates the messages which are exchanged to
   create a mapping in a PCP-controlled device.

                +------+                           +------+

                |Client|                           |Server|
                +------+                           +------+

                    |                                  |


                  Figure 1: Example of creating a mapping

   The following sub-sections provide several examples depending on the
   included IEs in the PCP Map Create Request.

2.1.  Create a Mapping with Mandatory IEs

   This example illustrates the content of exchanged PCP messages when
   the PCP Client includes only mandatory IEs: Client-ID, Transport
   protocol (TCP), Internal Port Number and Internal IP Address.

2.4.  Create Mapping with a Preferred Lifetime

   In this example, the PCP Client includes all mandatory IEs, a
   preferred external port number and a preferred mapping lifetime.  The
   PCP Server returns a mapping using values it assigns according to its
   configured policies and port numbers availability.

          Hinted External Port Number IE (25685)

          Requested Mapping Lifetime IE (1800)

          Client-ID IE (ID)

          Transport Protocol IE (2)

          Internal Port Number IE (16254)

          Internal IP Address IE (198.51.100.1)

          External Port Number IE (16532)

          Assigned Mapping Lifetime IE (1800)

2.5.  Create Mapping with all Various Optional IEs

   This flow shows an example of the content of PCP messages that will
   be exchanged to create a mapping in a PCP-controlled device.  In this
   example, the PCP Client indicates a requested external UDP port
   number and also a DSCP marking policy (Internal DSCP <=> External
   DSCP).

   In reference to Figure 1, the content of exchanged PCP messages is as
   follows:

   1.  PCP Map Create Request

          Client-ID IE (Client-ID=ID)

          Transport Protocol IE (1)

          Internal Port Number IE (15968)

          Internal IP Address IE (192.168.0.1)

          Hinted External Port Number IE (15648)

          Internal DSCP IE (45)

          External DSCP IE (32)

          Requested Mapping Lifetime IE (8965)

   2.  PCP Map Create Response

2.6.  Create a Mapping with a Port Reservation Option

   The following example depicts a scenario where the PCP Client
   indicates its UDP port parity preference (using Port Reservation
   Option IE).  The PCP Server, if it supports such option, may assign
   an external port number according to the requested policy.

2.10.  Create Mapping with Distinct External IP Addresses

   Figure 3 shows a PCP Server with a pool of public IPv4 addresses
   (192.0.2/24) and two PCP Clients associated with different
   subscribers.  The PCP Clients each make a port mapping request to the
   PCP Server which creates the mapping from its 192.0.2/24 pool.

   This example shows the PCP exchange that occurs in order to retrieve

   The value of the transport protocol is positioned to 0 (i.e., all

   associated with a client/subscriber are to be returned whatever their
   associated transport protocol.

   this message, the PCP Client updates its local states.  The current
   PCP base document states that a a response is sent back to the PCP
   Client asking to delete a mapping which does not exist.  The
   motivation is that a previous delete request has been sent by the PCP
   Client but the response from the PCP Server has been lost.]]

6.  Retrieve the External IP Address

6.1.  Retrieve the External IP Address

   In order to retrieve the IP address used on the external side of the
   PCP-controlled device (Figure 8), a PCP Client issues a PCP PING
   message.  Once received by the PCP Server, a PCP PONG message is sent
   by the PCP Server in return.  This message conveys only the External
   IP Address IE.  This IE includes the external IP address used by the
   PCP-controlled device for all outbound communications established by
   the subscriber.

   An External IP Address IE is included in the PCP PONG response only
   if the PCP PING message included an Internal IP Address IE.

6.2.  Assess the Reachability of the PCP Server

   In this example, the PCP Client issues a PCP PING with no IEs to an
   IP address of a PCP Server.  Once received by the PCP Server, since
   it is configured to reply to such request, it sends back a PCP PONG
   including a Capability IE.

Abstract

   This document specifies the behavior of the UPnP IGD (Internet
   Gateway Device)/PCP interworking function.  An UPnP IGD-PCP
   Interworking function is required to be embedded in CP routers to
   allow for transparent NAT control in environments where UPnP is used
   in the LAN side and PCP in the external side of the CP router.

Internet-Draft     UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function     September 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overall Context

   PCP [I-D.wing-softwire-port-control-protocol] discusses the
   implementation of NAT control features that rely upon Provider NAT
   devices such as DS-Lite AFTR [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] or
   NAT64 [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  Nevertheless, in
   environments where UPnP is used in the home LAN, an interworking
   function between UPnP IGD and PCP is required to be embedded in the
   CP router (an example is illustrated in Figure 1).

                            UPnP-PCP
   UPnP Control           Interworking

        |--------------------->|                          |
        |                      |(2) PCP Map Create Request|
        |                      |------------------------->|

                          Figure 1: Flow Example

   This specification takes into account the requirements identified in
   PCP base document, particularly it avoids chatty exchanges (e.g., in
   case of invoking AddPortMapping()) and prevents against overload
   phenomena (e.g., avalanche restart).  The UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking
   Function maintains a local mapping table which stores all active
   mappings instructed by internal UPnP Control Points.  This design
   choice restricts the amount of PCP messages to be exchanged with the
   PCP Server.

   Triggers for deactivating the UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function from
   the CP router and relying on a PCP-only mode are out of scope of this
   document.

1.2.  Purpose of this Document

   The objective of this document is to specify a UPnP IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function to ensure successful control of PCP-controlled
   devices by UPnP Control Points.  Two configurations are considered:

   o  No NAT function is embedded in the CP router.  This function is
      required for instance in DS-Lite or NAT64 deployments;

   o  The CP router embeds a NAT function.

2.  Acronyms

   This document make use of the following abbreviations:

   o  CP router: Customer Premise router

   o  DS-Lite: Dual-Stack Lite

   o  IGD: Internet Gateway Device

   o  IE: Informational Element

   o  PCP: Port Control Protocol

   o  UPnP: Universal Plug and Play


3.  Architecture Model

   As a reminder, Figure 2 illustrates the architecture model adopted by
   UPnP IGD.  In Figure 2, the following UPnP terminology is used:

   o  Client refers to a host located in the local network.

   o  IGD Control Point is a UPnP control point using UPnP to control an
      IGD (Internet Gateway Device).

   o  Host represents a remote host reachable in the Internet.

   In the updated model depicted in Figure 3, one or two levels of NAT
   can be encountered in the data path.  Indeed, in addition to the
   Provider NAT, the CP router may embed a NAT function (Figure 4).

                      Figure 4: Cascaded NAT scenario

   To ensure a successful interworking between UPnP IGD and PCP, an
   interworking function is embedded in the CP router.  In the model
   defined in Figure 3, all UPnP IGD server-oriented functions, a PCP
   Client [I-D.wing-softwire-port-control-protocol] and a UPnP IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function are embedded in the CP router (i.e., IGD).  In
   the rest of the document, IGD-PCP Interworking Function refers to PCP
   Client and UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function.

   UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function is responsible for generating a
   well-formed PCP (resp., UPnP IGD) message from a received UPnP IGD
   (resp., PCP) message.


4.  UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function: Overview

   Table 1 provides the mapping between WANIPConnection parameters and
   PCP parameters while Table 2 focuses on the correspondence between
   supported methods.  Note that some enhancements have been integrated
   in WANIPConnection as documented in [IGD2].

   In the following table, IE stands for Informational Element.  PCP IEs
   are defined in the base PCP document.

5.  Specification of the IGD-PCP Interworking Function

   This section covers the scenarios with or without NAT in the CP
   router.

5.1.  PCP Server Discovery

   The IGD-PCP Interworking Function implements one of the discovery
   methods identified in [I-D.wing-softwire-port-control-protocol]
   (e.g., DHCP [I-D.bpw-softwire-pcp-dhcp]).  The IGD-PCP Interworking
   Function behaves as a PCP Client when communicating with the
   provisioned PCP Server.

Internet-Draft     UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function     September 2010


   When the IGD-PCP Interworking Function encounters reachability
   problems (e.g., failure to retrieve an IP address of the PCP Server,
   routing issue, etc.) to reach a PCP Server, and if an IP address has
   been successfully assigned to the external interface of the device
   embedding the IGD-PCP Interworking Function, IGD-PCP Interworking
   Function MUST NOT be invoked.  Indeed, UPnP machinery is used to
   control that device.

   Once the PCP Sever is reachable, the IGD-PCP Interworking Function
   MUST synchronise its states as specified in Section 5.10.

5.2.  Control of the Firewall

   In order to configure security policies to be applied to inbound and
   outbound traffic, UPnP IGD can be used to control a local firewall
   engine.

   No IGD-PCP Interworking Function is therefore required for that
   purpose.

5.3.  NAT Control in LAN Side

   Internal UPnP Control Points are not aware of the presence of the
   IGD-PCP Interworking Function in the CP router (IGD).  Especially,
   UPnP Control Points MUST NOT be aware of the deactivation of the NAT
   in the CP router.

   No modification is required in the UPnP Control Point.

5.4.  Port Mapping Tables

   IGD-PCP Interworking Function MUST store locally all the mappings
   instantiated by internal UPnP Control Points in the PCP Server.  Port
   Forwarding mappings SHOULD be stored in a permanent storage.  If not,
   upon reset or reboot, the IGD-PCP Interworking Function MUST
   synchronise its states as specified in Section 5.10.

   Upon receipt of a PCP PINxy Response from the PCP Server, the IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function MUST retrieve the enclosed mapping(s) and MUST
   store it in the local mapping table.  The local mapping table is an
   image of the mapping table as maintained by the PCP Server for a
   given subscriber.

   In case a NAT function is enabled in the CP router, the following
   sub-section describes the structure of the NAT table.

Internet-Draft     UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function     September 2010


5.4.1.  Structure of CP Router NAT Table

   In order to behave in a multi-levels of NAT, the NAT mapping table of
   the CP router should be structured appropriately.  All required
   information to handle incoming packets must be stored locally.  The
   IGD-PCP Interworking Function MUST be able to notify the external
   reachability information, as assigned by the last NAT in the chain,
   to the requesting UPnP Control Point.

   When two levels of NAT are present, the following information MUST be
   stored in the NAT mapping table of the first NAT:

   o  Internal IP address: the IP address of a host as assigned in the
      LAN;

   o  Internal port number: the port number used by a host;

   o  Local IP address: the IP address assigned by the first NAT upon
      receipt of a mapping request.  This address is bound to the
      external interface of the first NAT.  This address is maintained
      by the second NAT as being the internal IP address of the
      requesting PCP Client (i.e., IGD-PCP Interworking Function);

   o  Local port number: the port number assigned by the first NAT.
      This port number is maintained by the second NAT as being the
      internal port number of the requesting PCP Client;

   o  External IP address: the IP address assigned by the second NAT.
      Under normal conditions, this is the address which MUST be
      communicated by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function to the
      requesting UPnP Control Point;

   o  External port number: the port number allocated by the second NAT.
      Under normal conditions, this is the port number which MUST be
      communicated by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function to the
      requesting UPnP Control Point.

   For illustration purposes, let consider a host requesting a mapping
   for (Internal IP address=IP1, Internal port number=P1).  This mapping
   request is received by the first level of NAT which assigns a local
   mapping corresponding to (IP2, P2), a PCP mapping request is then
   generated and sent to the second NAT which returns (IP3, P3) as the
   external reachability information for that request.

   o  The first NAT, updates its mapping table with the full entry which
      includes ((IP1, P1), (IP2, P2), (IP3, P3)).

   o  The first NAT communicates to the requesting UPnP Control Point
      its external reachability information as assigned by the PCP
      Server: (IP3, P3).

   o  The second NAT maintains a mapping entry which includes ((IP2,
      P2), (IP3, P3)).

   o  Upon receipt of a datagrams matching this mapping, the second NAT
      undertakes a NAPT operation which corresponds to translating (IP3,
      P3) into (IP2, P2).

   o  Upon receipt of a datagrams matching this mapping, the first NAT
      undertakes a NAPT operation which corresponds to translating (IP2,
      P2) into (IP1, P1).

5.5.  Interworking Function Without NAT in the CP Router

   When no NAT is embedded in the CP router, the content of received
   WANIPConnection and PCP messages is not altered by the IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function (i.e., the content of WANIPConnection messages
   are copied to the PCP messages (and vice versa) according to
   Table 1).

5.6.  NAT Embedded in the CP Router

   Unlike the scenario with one level of NAT (Section 5.5), the IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function MUST update their content of received mapping
   messages with the IP address and/or port number belonging to the
   external interface of the CP router (i.e., after the NAT1 operation
   in Figure 4) and not as initially positioned by the UPnP Control
   Point.

   All WANIPConnection messages issued by the UPnP Control Point (resp.,
   PCP Server) are intercepted by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function.
   Then, the corresponding messages (see Table 1 and Table 2) are
   generated by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function and sent to the
   provisioned PCP Server (resp., corresponding UPnP Control Point).
   The content of PCP messages received by the PCP Server reflects the
   mapping information as enforced in the first NAT.  In particular, the
   internal IP address and/or port number of the requests are replaced
   with the IP address and port number as assigned by the NAT of the CP
   router.  For the reverse path, PCP response messages are intercepted
   by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function.  The content of the
   corresponding WANIPConnection messages are updated:

   o  The internal IP address and/or port number as initially positioned
      by the UPnP Control Point and stored in the CP router NAT are used
      to update the corresponding fields in received PCP responses.

   o  The external IP and port number are not altered by the IGD-PCP
      Interworking Function.

   o  The NAT mapping entry in the first NAT is updated with the result
      of PCP request.

   The lifetime of the mappings instantiated in all involved NATs SHOULD
   be the one assigned by the terminating PCP Server.  In any case, the
   lifetime MUST be lower or equal to the one assigned by the
   terminating PCP Server.

   [[ NOTE:

   Do we need to indicate somehow that some flows are not meant to exit
   a local domain and then there is no need to instantiate a mapping in
   the upstream NAT?

   A flow has local (private) significance, Internet-only significance
   or both.

   * In the case of private-only significance, UPnP provides a mapping
   on its own.

   * In the case of Internet-only, without a PCP server, the UPnP side
   can deny the request

   * In the case of both, without a PCP server, UPnP still provides a
   mapping.  Synch procedure is needed after PCP Server is reachable.

   The open question is that we lack a mechanism to determine the
   significance (possibly out of scope).  If there is a mechanism the
   rules above can be followed.  Without a mechanism if PCP Client is
   enabled but PCP Server in unreachable, UPnP should always return a
   mapping and synch later. ]]

5.7.  Creating a Mapping

   Two methods can be used to create a mapping: AddPortMapping() or
   AddAnyPortMapping().  AddAnyPortMapping() is the RECOMMENDED method.

5.7.1.  AddAnyPortMapping()

   When an UPnP Control Point issues a AddAnyPortMapping(), this request
   is received by the UPnP Server.  This request is then relayed to the
   IGD-PCP Interworking Function which generates a PCP PINxy Request
   (see Table 1 for mapping between WANIPConnection and PCP parameters).
   Upon receipt of PCP PINxy Response from the PCP Server, an XML
   mapping is returned to the requesting UPnP Control Point (the content

   of the messages follows the recommendations listed in Section 5.6 or
   Section 5.5 according to the deployed scenario).

   If a PCP Error is received from the PCP Server, a corresponding
   WANIPConnection error code is generated by the IGD-PCP Interworking
   Function and sent to the requesting UPnP Control Point.

5.7.2.  AddPortMapping()

   Upon receipt of AddPortMapping() from an UPnP Control Point, the IGD-
   PCP Interworking Function first checks if the requested external port
   number is not used by another Internal UPnP Control Point.  In case a
   mapping bound to the requested external port number is found in the
   local table, the IGD-PCP Interworking Function MUST send back an
   error to the requesting UPnP Control Point.  This exchange is re-
   iterated until an external port number that is not in use is
   requested by the UPnP Control Point.  Then, the IGD-PCP Interworking
   Function generates a PCP PINxy Request with all requested mapping
   information as indicated by the UPnP Control Point if no NAT is
   embedded in the CP router or updated as specified in Section 5.6.  A
   shortened requested lifetime SHOULD be used by the IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function when generating the corresponding request to
   the PCP Server (this is motivated by port usage optimisation needs).
   Once received by the PCP Server, a PCP PINxy Response or a PCP Error
   MUST be issued.  In case a positive answer from the PCP Server is
   received by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function, the returned mapping
   MAY be different from the one requested by the UPnP Control Point.
   The returned mapping MUST be stored by the IGD-PCP Interworking
   Function in its local mapping table.

   o  If the returned mapping matches the mapping requested by the UPnP
      Control Point, a positive answer MUST be sent to the requesting
      UPnP Control Point.  This answer terminates this exchange;

   o  If not, the IGD-PCP Interworking Function uses the stored mapping
      as the only valid candidate to reply to any subsequent-related
      request from the same UPnP Control Point pointing to the same
      internal Client.  Especially, no PCP message related to this
      mapping request MUST be relayed to the PCP Server until that
      mapping expires.

      *  If the UPnP Control Point succeeds to retrieve the mapping from
         the IGD-PCP Interworking Function, the UPnP Control Point
         should refresh the mapping if the mapping is still in use.

      *  The IGD-PCP Interworking Function SHOULD delete the mapping in
         the PCP Server if the UPnP Control Point abandoned to create a
         mapping for the same internal port number and IP address (a

         timer can be defined for this purpose).  If no explicit delete
         request is sent by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function, the
         corresponding mapping MUST be dropped by the PCP Server upon
         expiration of the lifetime.

5.8.  Listing One or a Set of Mappings

   In order to list active mappings, an UPnP Control Point may issue
   GetGenericPortMappingEntry(), GetSpecificPortMappingEntry() or
   GetListOfPortMappings().

   These methods MUST NOT be proxied to the PCP Server since a local
   mapping is maintained by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function.

5.9.  Delete One or a Set of Mappings

   An UPnP Control Point proceeds to the deletion of one or a list of
   mappings by issuing DeletePortMapping() or DeletePortMappingRange().
   When one of these messages is received by the IGD-PCP Interworking
   Function, it first checks if the requested mapping to be removed is
   present in the local mapping table.

   o  If no mapping matching the request is found in the local table, an
      error is sent back to the UPnP Control Point;

   o  Otherwise, PCP PINxy delete request is generated taking into
      account the input arguments

      *  as included in DeletePortMapping() or DeletePortMappingRange()
         if no NAT is enabled in the CP router;

      *  or the corresponding local IP address and port number as
         assigned by the local NAT if a NAT is enabled in the CP router.

   o  Once received by the PCP Server, it proceeds to removing the
      corresponding entry(ies), a PCP PINxy Delete Response is sent back
      if the removal of the corresponding entry(ies) was successful; if
      not, a PCP Error is sent back to the IGD-PCP Interworking Function
      including the corresponding error cause (e.g., not authorised).

   When a positive answer is received from the PCP Server, the IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function updates its local mapping table (i.e., remove
   the corresponding entry(ies)) and notifies the UPnP Control Point
   about the result of the removal operation.

5.10.  Mapping Synchronisation

   [[Note: This section needs further discussion among authors]]

   Under normal conditions, since a valid copy of the mapping table is
   stored locally in the CP router, the IGD-PCP Interworking Function
   SHOULD NOT issue any subsequent PCP request to handle a request
   received from an UPnP Control Point to list active mappings.
   Nevertheless, in case of loss of synchronisation (e.g., reboot,
   system crashes, power outage, etc.), the IGD-PCP Interworking
   Function SHOULD generate a PCP Map List Request to retrieve all
   active mappings in the PCP Server and update its local mapping table
   without waiting for an explicit request from a UPnP Control Point.
   Doing so, the IGD-PCP Interworking Function maintains an updated
   mapping table.

   In case of massive reboot of CP routers (e.g., avalanche restart
   phenomenon), PCP request bursts SHOULD be avoided.  For this aim, we
   recommend the use of a given timer denoted as PCP_SERVICE_WAIT.  This
   timer can be pre-configured in the CP router or to be provisioned
   using a dedicated means such as DHCP (See Section 3.3 of
   [I-D.bpw-softwire-pcp-dhcp]).  Upon reboot of the CP router, PCP
   messages SHOULD NOT be sent immediately.  A random value is selected
   between 0 and PCP_SERVICE_WAIT.  This value is referred to as
   RAND(PCP_SERVICE_WAIT).  Upon the expiration of
   RAND(PCP_SERVICE_WAIT), the CP router SHOULD proceed to its
   synchronisation operations (i.e., retrieve all active mappings which
   have been instructed by internal UPnP Control Point(s)).

1. Introduction 

   In packet transport network, protection switching can be triggered by 
   fault conditions and external manual commands. The fault conditions 
   include Signal Failure (SF) and Signal Degrade (SD). SF on a 
   transport entity can be detected by fault management OAM functions; 
   SD on a transport entity can be detected by performance monitoring 
   OAM functions. 

   The SD condition used for protection switching mostly depends on 
   packet loss ratio. For some services that are sensitive to time and 
   synchronization, the SD condition may depend on packet loss ratio, 
   packet delay and delay variation.

   In MPLS-TP OAM tools, the packet loss measurement (LM) is used to 
   measure the amount of the lost service packets and compute the loss 
   ratio of service packet. The packet Delay Measurement (DM) is used to 
   measure the packet delay and delay variation by sending periodic DM 
   packets during the diagnostic interval. The LM and DM mechanisms are 
   out of scope of this document. 

   The detection of SD (e.g. packet loss) must be based on service 
   packets. But in some situation, there is no normal traffic on 
   working/protection transport entity, which makes the detection of SD 
   based on service packets impossible and causes switch flapping. 

   This document describes the mechanism for SD detection and consequent 
   protection switching in 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture. 

2. Terminology 

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in MPLS-TP. 
   The relationship between ITU-T and IETF terminologies on MPLS-TP can 
   be found in [Rosetta stone].

3. SD-Triggered Protection Switching Architecture 

   The SD-triggered protection switching complies with general 
   protection architecture. 

   In case of MPLS-TP 1+1 protection architecture, the normal traffic is 
   permanently sent on both working and protection entities by the 
   permanent bridge at the source. Therefore, the detection of SD or the 
   clearing of SD on both working and protection entities can be based 
   on the characteristics of the normal traffic. 

   In case of MPLS-TP 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture, the selector 
   bridge is usually adopted at the source end. The normal traffic is 
   transported on the working entity together with the OAM of the 
   working entity, while on the protection entity only the OAM of the 
   protection entity is transported alone so that it may not be possible 
   to detect SD. If SD is detected on a working entity, protection 
   switching is occurred, and the traffic is transported on the 
   protection entity together with OAM. On the working entity OAM 
   packets is transported alone, and the detected SD may be cleared even 
   if the working entity is still degraded. This will result in another 
   switch of traffic back to the working entity, and SD may be detected 
   again, etc. 

   As mentioned above, in case of 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture, 
   the normal traffic will be either on the working transport entity or 
   on the protection transport entity. This makes it impossible to 
   detect SD on the standby entity. Consequently SD will be detected 
   only after a protection switch and flapping may happen. 

4. SD-Triggered Protection Solution Analysis 

   In case of 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture, there are the 
   following solutions to implement the SD-triggered protection 
   switching without flapping. 

   - The detection of SD is based on OAM packets; (Section 4.1) 

   - The broadcast bridge has to be applied to enable SD detection in 
      SD-triggered protection, together with  

      - the special APS request priority (Section 4.2), or 

      - the extra protection switching coordination (Section 4.3). 

      The broadcasting is applied only in case protection switching is 
      active.

4.1. SD-Triggered Protection Based on OAM packets 

4.1.1. Detection of SD 

   In case of 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture, for the transport 
   entity on which there is no normal traffic, the detection of SD can 
   be based on OAM packets, e.g. 

   - OAM packets for Test 

   The Test OAM packets can be used to simulate the characteristics of 
   the normal traffic and replace the normal service. With the 
   performance monitoring OAM packets (LM) the SD condition of the 
   transport entity can be detected. 

   - OAM packets for CC/CV 

   The CC/CV OAM packets can be used instead of normal service in packet 
   loss measurement. That is, the performance monitoring OAM packets (LM) 
   will count CC/CV packets and the loss measurement is based on CC/CV 
   packets, which will be used as the input of SD condition of the 
   transport entity where there is no normal service.  

   The above-mentioned SD-triggered protection switching mechanism based 
   on OAM packets (test or CC/CV) is general and flexible without 
   constraint to the bridge type at source end, that may be selector 
   bridge or broadcast bridge. 

   The performance measurement by Test OAM packets is accurate. But the 
   usage of test packets on the protection entity defeats the objective 
   of the 1:1 and 1:n architectures, which is to have the protection 
   entity bandwidth available for best effort traffic during the time 
   there is no fault or degradation of the working transport entity. The 
   test packets consume now this bandwidth. For the case of the 1:1 
   protection, this makes the bandwidth usage of this 1:1 architecture 
   similar to the bandwidth usage of the 1+1 architecture. 

   OAM packets for CC/CV are sent in fixed transmission period (3.3ms, 
   10ms, 1s, etc.) which doesn't exactly reflect the condition of real 
   services. It is applicable only in places without strict requirement 
   for SD measurement. The detection of SD by CC/CV is not recommended 
   when the packet loss is caused by congestion. 

4.1.2. APS Protocol 

   In APS request types, similar to the definition of SF-W (SF for 
   working entity) and SF-P (SF for protection entity), a definition of

Internet-Draft       draft-zhl-mpls-tp-sd-02.txt            March 2010 
    

   SD-W (SD for working entity) and SD-P (SD for protection entity) is 
   required to prevent flapping. 

   The priority of SD-P and SD-W shall be fixed as SD-P > SD-W similar 
   to SF-P > SF-W. In this case a protection switching based on SD 
   detection on the working entity shall not be initiated if there 
   exists also an SD condition on the protection transport entity.  

4.2. Broadcast Bridge with Special APS Request Priority 

   SD-triggered protection based on normal traffic can be implemented by 
   adopting broadcast bridge at source end with the special APS request 
   priority.

        Figure 2 SD on Working Entity in 1:1 Protection Architecture 
    
   When SD is detected on the working transport entity, the sink end 
   sends SD-W indication to the source end and the selector at the sink 
   end switches to the protection transport entity. The broadcast bridge 
   at the source end will then send the normal traffic on both working 
   and protection transport entities and the performance of both working 
   and protection transport entities can be monitored for SD (see Figure 
   2).  

   If SD is detected on the protection transport entity as well, i.e. 
   SD-W and SD-P exist simultaneously, normal traffic will still be 
   selected at the sink from the protection transport entity to avoid 
   flapping between protection and working states. 

4.2.2. APS Protocol 

   In this case the priority of SD-W and SD-P in the APS protocol is 
   fixed as SD-W > SD-P to avoid flapping between protection entity and 
   working entity. 

4.3. Broadcast Bridge with Extra Protection Switching Coordination 

   SD-triggered protection based on normal traffic can be implemented by 
   adopting broadcast bridge at source end with the extra protection 
   switching coordination. 

   The SD-W based protection switch action described in section 4.2.1 
   assumes that the probability of SD condition occurring on both 
   working entity and protection entity at the same time is very small. 
   When this assumption is not considered to be reasonable, the 
   operation of the selector may be modified as described hereafter.

        Figure 3 SD on Working Entity in 1:1 Protection Architecture 
    
   When the sink end detects an SD condition, it does not switch to the 
   protection entity immediately. Instead, the broadcast bridge at the 
   source end will first send the normal traffic on both working and 
   protection transport entity after receiving SD-W indication sent by 
   the sink end (see Figure 3). Then sink end is able to detect the SD 
   condition of working and protection transport entity. 

   If SD is detected on the protection transport entity as well, the 
   normal traffic remains broadcasted to both working and protection 
   transport entities and is selected from the working transport entity; 
   if no SD is detected on the protection transport entity the normal 
   traffic is selected from the protection entity.

   The SD priority is the same as described in 4.1.2: SD-P > SD-W. 

4.4. Analysis 

   In section 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, the different mechanisms for detecting 
   SD are described. The mechanism described in 4.2 is preferred because 
   of its simplicity, accuracy and flexibility.

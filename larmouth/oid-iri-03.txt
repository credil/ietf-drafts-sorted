Internet-Draft  IRI/URI Namespace for International OIDs    October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The International Object Identifier tree [ITU-T X.660] provides a
   hierarchically based identification scheme for objects/resources,
   using almost all Unicode/ISO 10646 characters to identify arcs in the
   tree.  The OID tree has been in existence since about 1984 in a
   numerical form, but the ability to have arcs identified by Unicode
   labels to identify arcs of the International Object Identifier tree
   was only standardized in 2008.  The first identifier in the sequence
   can be the name of any standards body or any other organization that
   requests an unambiguous identification of that organization, with
   subsequent identifications in the hierarchy being allocated by that
   organization.

   There are just under 100,000 allocated Object Identifiers that are
   recorded in the OID Repository at http://www.oid-info.com

   The URN namespace "urn:oid" as defined in [RFC3061] is based entirely
   on numeric identification of each arc.  For ITU-T purposes, it is
   essential to be able to use names in any language as well as numbers,
   without resort to any % encoding or restriction to numeric values
   where an IRI can be used.  This form of URI/IRI provides that
   facility for communications that accept an IRI.  In other
   circumstances there is a well-specified mapping to a URI.
   Consideration was given to extending the "urn:oid" scheme to allow
   names as well as numbers, but this was considered complicated and
   confusing for existing uses of "urn:oid".  A separate new 'oid' IRI
   scheme was considered far preferable.

   This form of URI/IRI commences with "oid:/" and is followed by a
   series of Unicode labels separated by the SOLIDUS '/' character,
   identifying a node in the hierarchical International Object
   Identifier tree.

   NOTE - The SOLIDUS '/' character is not permitted in Unicode labels.

   An IRI can contain most of the Unicode characters, and in particular
   can contain all the characters allowed in a Unicode label.  A URI is
   restricted to the ASCII character set, but [RFC3987], Section 3.1
   specifies the conversion of the characters allowed in an IRI into the
   characters allowed in a URI, enabling both an IRI and a URI to carry
   the same semantics for the identification.  This mapping is an
   integral part of the "oid" URI/IRI scheme.  This enables names based
   on the Unicode labels in the International OID tree to be used
   wherever an IRI or a URI is required.

   The resource designated by an 'oid' IRI is a set of URLs for multi-
   media information associated with the node of the International OID

   Tree, and returned by the OID Resolution System [ORS] when given that
   IRI.


2.  URI/IRI scheme syntax and semantics for 'oid'

2.1.  URI/IRI scheme syntax

   This Section uses the ABNF notation commonly used in IETF RFCs (see
   [RFC 5234]).  An IRI in the 'oid' scheme is syntactically the ABNF
   construct <oidiri> defined as follows (with the semantics specified
   in 2.5), and with no white-space between lexical items:

   oidiri = "oid:/" firstarcid subsequentarcid
   firstarcid = unicodelabel
   subsequentarcid = 0*("/" unicodelabel)
   unicodelabel = 1*(iunreserved)

   The external rule name <iunreserved> is defined in Section 2.2 of
   [RFC3987].

   When used as a URI, the transformations specified in [RFC 3987],
   Section 3.1 are applied.

2.2.  URI/IRI scheme semantics

   The <firstarcid> is required to be a Unicode label assigned to one of
   the arcs from the root of the International OID tree specified in
   [ITU-T X.660] (including long arcs) that identifies a node in the
   International OID tree.

   The next <unicodelabel> in the <subsequentarcid> (if there is one) is
   required to be a Unicode label that identifies an arc from that node
   to a lower level node.

   This repeats until the final <unicodelabel> identifies an arc, and
   hence a node of the International OID tree, that is the referenced
   resource.

   NOTE - The last identified node is not necessarily a leaf of the
   tree, but it identifies the designated resource.

2.3.  Encoding considerations

   The internationalized resource identifier is specified as an abstract
   sequence of Unicode characters.  The encoding of those characters
   depends on the specification of the protocol in which they are
   carried, but will normally be UTF-8 [RFC3629].

2.4.  Applications and/or protocols that use this scheme

   This scheme can be used by any specification requiring an IRI or URI
   based on the international OID tree to identify an object or to
   retrieve information associated with that object.

   The 'oid' IRIs are used for two purposes.

   The first is identification of objects such as XSD or ASN.1
   specifications, where the only operation is obtaining the identified
   object from a repository, known by context.  In this case, there will
   normally be only a single 'oid' IRI value that will identify the
   object in the repository.

   The second is the retrieval of information associated with any node
   of the object identifier tree using the OID Resolution System [ORS]

2.5.  Operations on the 'oid' IRIs

   Operations are transformation to a canonical form (using the [ORS]),
   and comparison of the canonical forms (where exact equality is
   required for a match) and retrieval of information identified by the
   'oid' IRI.

   These operations are expected to be used by applications specifically
   related to the object in question, and are not expected to be
   supported by general-purpose software.

2.6.  Interoperability considerations

   Equality of 'oid' URIs/IRIs shall be based on exact equality of the
   slash-separated sequence of <unicodelabel>s building up the canonical
   form of the IRI, obtainable by the [ORS] DNS look-up.  The IRI scheme
   name itself ('oid') is not case sensitive.

   There are no other known interoperability issues.


3.  Security considerations

3.1.  General

   An 'oid' IRI does not in itself pose a security threat.  However,
   care must be taken to properly interpret the data referenced by an
   'oid' IRI, to prevent that data from causing unintended access, and
   to avoid including data that should not be revealed in plain text.
   These security considerations are addressed by [ORS] through
   availability of DNSSEC in the resolution process, and optional return

   of encrypted data, with an established trust anchor.

3.2.  Reliability and Consistency

   There is no guarantee that once an OID IRI has been used to retrieve
   information, the same information will be retrievable by that IRI in
   the future.  Nor is there any guarantee that the information
   retrievable via that IRI in the future will be observably similar to
   that retrieved in the past.

3.3.  Spoofing

   The ability to include effectively the full range of Unicode
   characters in an OID IRI may make it easier to execute certain forms
   of address mimicking (also called "spoofing").  However, OID IRIs are
   no different from other IRIs in this regard, and applications that
   will present OID IRIs to human users must adhere to best practices
   regarding address mimicking in order to help prevent attacks that
   result from spoofed addresses (e.g., the phenomenon known as
   "phishing").  For details, refer to the Security Considerations of
   [RFC3987].


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  General

   (The IANA Registration Template is in 4.2)

   Having the 'oid' IRI scheme registered with IANA ensures that there
   is no duplication of the 'oid' IRI scheme.

   The introduction to [RFC 2434] (para 4) states that "Object
   Identifiers (OIDs) as defined by the ITU are also delegated.  When a
   name space can be delegated, the IANA only deals with assignments at
   the top level."

   Thus the only IANA responsibility is the registration of the scheme
   name, except that it has a long-standing registration responsibility
   for the sub-tree 1.3.6.1 (oid:/ISO/org/dod/internet), and has made
   many sub-allocations.  This is not affected by this provision of an
   'oid' IRI scheme.

4.2.  IANA Registration Template

   This filled-out template should be added to the URI Schemes registry

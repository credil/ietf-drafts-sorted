   Reactive Discovery of Point-to-Point Routes in Low Power and Lossy

Abstract

   Point to point (P2P) communication between arbitrary IPv6 routers and
   hosts in a Low power and Lossy Network (LLN) is a key requirement for
   many applications.  RPL, the IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs,
   constrains the LLN topology to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and
   requires the P2P routing to take place along the DAG links.  Such P2P
   routes may be significantly suboptimal and may lead to traffic
   congestion near the DAG root.  This document describes a P2P route
   discovery mechanism complementary to RPL base functionality.  This
   mechanism allows an RPL-aware IPv6 router or host to discover and
   establish on demand one or more routes to another RPL-aware IPv6
   router or host in the LLN such that the discovered routes meet the
   specified cost criteria.

1.  Introduction

   RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] provides multipoint-to-point (MP2P) routes
   from nodes in a Low power and Lossy Network (LLN) to a sink node by
   organizing the nodes along a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) rooted at
   the sink.  The nodes determine their position in the DAG so as to
   optimize their routing cost to reach the DAG root.  A node advertises
   its position (the "rank") in the DAG by originating a DODAG
   Information Object (DIO) message.  The DIO message is sent via link-
   local multicast and also includes information such as the DAG root's
   identity, the routing metrics/constraints
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics] and the objective function (OF) in
   use.  When a node joins the DAG, it determines its own rank in the
   DAG based on that advertised by its neighbors and originates its own
   DIO message.

   RPL enables point-to-multipoint (P2MP) routing from a node to its
   descendants in the DAG by allowing a node to send a Destination
   Advertisement Object (DAO) upwards along the DAG.  The DAO carries
   the potentially aggregated information regarding the descendants (and
   other local prefixes) reachable through the originating node.

   RPL also provides mechanisms for point-to-point (P2P) routing between
   any two nodes in the DAG.  If the destination is within the source's
   "range", the source may directly send packets to the destination.
   Otherwise, a packet's path from the source to the destination depends
   on the storing/non-storing operation mode of the DAG.  In non-storing
   mode operation, only the DAG root maintains downward routing
   information and hence a packet travels all the way to the DAG root,
   which then sends it towards its destination using a source route.  In
   storing mode operation, if the destination is a DAG descendant and
   the source maintains "downwards" routing state about this descendant,
   it can forward the packet along this route.  Otherwise, the source
   sends the packet to a DAG parent, which then applies the same set of
   rules to forward the packet further.  Thus, a packet travels up the
   DAG until it reaches a node that knows of the downwards route to the
   destination and then it travels down the DAG towards its destination.
   A node may or may not maintain routing state about a descendant
   depending on whether its immediate children send it such information
   in their DAOs.  Thus, in the best case storing mode scenario, the
   "upwards" segment of the P2P route between a source and a destination
   ends at the first common ancestor of the source and the destination.
   In the worst case, the "upwards" segment would extend all the way to
   the DAG's root.  In both storing and non-storing mode operations, if
   the destination did not originate a DAO, the packet will travel all
   the way to the DAG's root, where it will be dropped.

   The P2P routing functionality available in RPL may be inadequate for

   applications in the home and commercial building domains because of
   the following reasons
   [I-D.brandt-roll-rpl-applicability-home-building] [RFC5826][RFC5867]:

   o  The need to maintain routes "proactively", i.e. every possible
      destination in the DAG must originate a DAO.

   o  Depending on the network topology and OF/metrics in use, the
      constraint to route only along a DAG may potentially cause
      significantly suboptimal P2P routes and severe traffic congestion
      near the DAG root.

   Clearly, there is a need for a mechanism that provides source-
   initiated discovery of P2P routes that are not along an existing DAG.
   This document thus describes such a mechanism, complementary to the
   basic RPL functionality.

   The specified scheme is based on a reactive on-demand approach, which
   enables a node to discover one or more "good enough" routes in either
   direction between itself and another node in the LLN without any
   constraints regarding the existing DAG-membership of the links that
   such routes may use.  Such routes may be source-routes or hop-by-hop
   ones.  A complementary functionality, necessary to help decide
   whether to initiate a route discovery, is a mechanism to measure the
   end-to-end cost of an existing route.  Section 7 provides further
   details on how such functionality, to be described in a separate
   document, can be used to determine the "good enough" criteria for use
   in the route discovery mechanism described in this document.


2.  Targeted Use Cases

   The mechanisms described in this document are intended to be employed
   as complementary to RPL in specific scenarios that need point-to-
   point (P2P) routes between arbitrary routers.

   One target use case, common in a home environment, involves a remote
   control (or a motion sensor) that suddenly needs to communicate with
   a lamp module, whose network address it knows apriori.  In this case,
   the source of data (the remote control or the motion sensor) must be
   able to discover a route to the destination (the lamp module) "on
   demand".

   Another target use case, common in a large commercial building
   environment, involves a large LLN deployment where P2P communication
   along a particular DAG among hundreds (or thousands) of routers
   creates severe traffic congestion near that DAG's root, and thus
   routes across this DAG are desirable.

Internet-Draft          draft-dt-roll-p2p-rpl-02             August 2010


   Targeted use cases also include scenarios where energy or latency
   constraints are not satisfied by the P2P routes along a DAG because
   they involve traversing many more intermediate routers than necessary
   to reach the destination.


3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology] and [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  Specifically,
   the term node refers to an RPL router or an RPL host as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  This document introduces the following terms:

   Origin Node: The RPL node initiating the route discovery.  The origin
   node acts as one end point of the routes to be discovered.

   Target Node: The RPL node at the other end point of the routes to be
   discovered.

   Intermediate Router: An RPL router that is neither the origin nor the
   target.

   Forward Route: A route from the origin node to the target node.

   Backward Route: A route from the target node to the origin node.

   Bidirectional Route: A route that can be used in both directions:
   from the origin node to the target node and vice versa.

   Source Route: A complete and ordered list of routers that can be used
   by a packet to travel from a source node to a destination node.  Such
   source routes can be carried by a packet in a proposed Type 4 Routing
   Header [I-D.ietf-6man-rpl-routing-header].

   Hop-by-hop Route: The route characterized by each router on the route
   using its routing table to determine the next hop on the route.

   Propagation Constraints: The constraints on aggregated routing metric
   values, as defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics], that MUST be
   satisfied before an intermediate router will process the Route
   Discovery Option (defined in this document) contained inside a DODAG
   Information Object (DIO).

   Route Constraints: Additional constraints on aggregated routing
   metric values, as defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics], that
   MUST be satisfied by a discovered route in order to be considered
   "good enough".

   Good Enough Criteria: The propagation constraints and the route
   constraints together constitute the good enough criteria.


4.  Functional Overview

   This section contains a high level description of the route discovery
   mechanism proposed in this document.

   The route discovery begins with the origin node generating a
   "Discovery" message.  The origin node indicates in the message:

   o  The target node;

   o  The relevant routing metrics;

   o  The constraints on how far the Discovery message may travel
      (henceforth called the propagation constraints);

   o  Additional constraints used to determine if a discovered route is
      "good enough" (henceforth called the route constraints);

   o  The direction (forward: from the origin node to the target node;
      backward: from the target node to the origin node; or
      bidirectional) of the route being discovered;

   o  The desired number of routes;

   o  Whether the route is a source-route or a hop-by-hop one.

   The Discovery message propagates via IPv6 link-local multicast with a
   receiving router discarding the message if it does not satisfy the
   propagation constraints or if hop-by-hop routes are desired and the
   router cannot store state for such a route.  As a copy of the
   Discovery message travels towards the target node, it accumulates the
   relevant routing metric values as well as the route it takes.  When
   the target node receives a copy of the Discovery message, it applies
   both the propagation constraints and the route constraints to
   determine if the discovered route is good enough.  Thus, the good
   enough discovered routes satisfy both the propagation constraints as
   well as the route constraints although the propagation of Discovery
   messages is guided by propagation constraints alone.  The propagation
   constraints and the route constraints together constitute the good

Internet-Draft          draft-dt-roll-p2p-rpl-02             August 2010


   enough criteria.  Using only a subset of the good enough criteria as
   the propagation constraints simplifies the operation of intermediate
   routers, an important consideration in many LLN application domains.

   The route discovery process may result in the discovery of several
   good enough routes.  This document does not specify how does the
   target node select routes among the good enough ones.  Example
   selection methods include selecting the routes as they are discovered
   or selecting the best routes discovered over a certain time period.

   If the origin node had requested the discovery of backward source-
   routes, the target node caches one or more good enough source-routes
   it selects.  Additionally, the target node sends one or more
   "Discovery Reply" message to the origin node to acknowledge the
   discovery of these routes.  These acknowledgements allow the origin
   node to judge the success of the route discovery.

   If the origin node had requested the discovery of "n" forward source-
   routes, the target node sends the "n" good enough source-routes it
   selects to the origin node in one or more Discovery Reply messages.

   If the origin node had requested the discovery of "n" bidirectional
   source-routes, the target node caches the "n" good enough source-
   routes it identifies and also sends these routes to the origin node
   in one or more Discovery Reply messages.

   If the origin node had requested the discovery of "n" forward/
   backward/bidirectional hop-by-hop routes, the target node sends out a
   Discovery Reply message to the origin node for each one of the "n"
   good enough routes it selects.  The Discovery Reply message travels
   towards the origin node along the discovered route.  As this message
   travels towards the origin node, it establishes appropriate forward/
   backward routing state in the routers on the path.


5.  Propagation of Discovery Messages

   RPL uses DIO message propagation to build a DAG.  The DIO message
   travels via IPv6 link-local multicast.  Each node joining the DAG
   determines a rank for itself and ignores the subsequent DIO messages
   received from lower (higher in numerical value) ranked neighbors.
   Thus, the DIO messages propagate outward from the DAG root rather
   than return inward towards the DAG root.  The DIO message generation
   at a node is further controlled by a trickle timer that allows a node
   to avoid generating unnecessary messages [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle].
   The link-local multicast based propagation, trickle-controlled
   generation and the rank-based poisoning of messages traveling in the
   wrong direction (towards the DAG root) provide powerful incentives to

Internet-Draft          draft-dt-roll-p2p-rpl-02             August 2010


   use the DIO message as the Discovery message and propagate the DIO/
   Discovery message by creating a "temporary" DAG.  The routing metrics
   used for the creation of this temporary DAG SHOULD be same as (or be
   a subset of) the routing metrics being used for route discovery.
   Similarly, the objective function, used for rank calculation in the
   temporary DAG, SHOULD be same as the objective function that
   determines the aggregated cost of a route when limited to the routing
   metrics being used for temporary DAG creation.

   The propagation constraints limit the spread of the temporary DAG.
   The temporary DAG restricts the network topology within which the
   route discovery takes place.  Thus, all the discovered routes lie
   within this restricted topology and implicitly satisfy the
   propagation constraints.  Among the discovered routes, the good
   enough routes are the ones that meet the route constraints.  Thus,
   for successful route discovery, the propagation constraints and the
   route constraints MUST be compatible.  The division of the overall
   good enough criteria between the two sets of constraints is an
   implementation specific decision.  If desired, an implementation MAY
   include all constraints in the set of propagation constraints and
   keep the set of route constraints empty.

              Figure 1: Format of the Route Discovery Option

   In order to be used as a Discovery message, a DIO MUST carry a "Route
   Discovery" option illustrated in Figure 1.  A DIO MUST NOT carry more
   than one Route Discovery options.  A router MUST ignore the second
   and subsequent Route Discovery options carried by a DIO.  A Route
   Discovery option consists of the following fields:

   o  Option Type = 0x09 (to be confirmed by IANA).

Internet-Draft          draft-dt-roll-p2p-rpl-02             August 2010


   o  Option Length = 20 or 22 octets depending on whether the OCP field
      is included or not.

   o  D: A 2-bit field that indicates the direction of the desired
      routes:

      *  D = 0x00: Forward;

      *  D = 0x01: Backward;

      *  D = 0x02: Bidirectional.

   o  H: This flag, when set, indicates if hop-by-hop routes are
      desired.  The flag is cleared if source routes are desired.

   o  N: A 3-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of routes
      desired.

   o  L: A 2-bit field indicating the minimum "Life Time" of the
      temporary DAG, i.e., the minimum duration a router joining the
      temporary DAG must maintain its membership in the DAG:

      *  L = 0x00: Minimum life time is 5 seconds;

      *  L = 0x01: Minimum life time is 10 seconds;

      *  L = 0x02: Minimum life time is 1 minute;

      *  L = 0x03: Minimum life time is 10 minutes.

   o  O: This flag, when set, indicates that an OCP field is present in
      the Route Discovery option.

   o  Target Address: The IPv6 address of the target node.

   o  OCP: 16 bit unsigned integer.  An optional field, present only if
      the O flag is set, This field indicates the objective function
      that MAY be used by the target node to compare two good enough
      routes.

5.2.  Setting a DIO Carrying a Route Discovery Option

   A DIO message that carries a Route Discovery option MUST set the Base
   Object, described in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], in the following manner:

   o  RPLInstanceID: RPLInstanceID MUST be a local value as described in
      Section 4.1 of [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

Internet-Draft          draft-dt-roll-p2p-rpl-02             August 2010


   o  Grounded (G) Flag: MUST be cleared since the objective of DAG
      formation is the propagation of Route Discovery option.  This DAG
      is temporary in nature and is not used for routing purpose.

   o  Destination Advertisement Supported (A) Flag: MUST be cleared for
      same reasons as described above.

   o  Destination Advertisement Trigger (T) Flag: MUST be cleared.

   o  Mode of Operation (MOP): This document suggests a new value (0x04)
      for this field (to be confirmed by IANA).

   o  DODAGPreference (Prf): TBD

   o  Destination Advertisement Trigger Sequence Number (DTSN): TBD

   o  DODAGID: IPv6 address of the origin node.

   The other fields in the Base Object are set as per the rules
   described in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   The DODAG Configuration option, carried in the DIO message, specifies
   the parameters for the trickle timer operation that governs the
   generation of DIO messages by the routers joining the temporary DAG.
   The future versions of this document will specify the default values
   to be used for these parameters.  The other fields defined in the
   DODAG Configuration option are set as follows:

   o  The MaxRankIncrease field MUST be set to 0 to disable local repair
      of the temporary DAG.

   o  This document RECOMMENDS a value 1 for the MinHopRankInc field.

   o  Objective Code Point (OCP): The OCP to be used for temporary DAG
      formation.  This document RECOMMENDS RPL Objective Function 0, as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-of0], for use as the objective function
      for the formation of the temporary DAG.  The objective function
      used for temporary DAG formation SHOULD be compatible with the
      objective function to determine the aggregated cost of a
      discovered route.

   A DIO, that contains a Route Discovery option, MUST specify the
   propagation constraints in one or more Metric Container options
   placed before the Route Discovery option and the route constraints in
   the Metric Container options placed after the Route Discovery option
   inside the DIO.  The routing metrics being used for temporary DAG
   formation SHOULD be same as or a subset of the routing metrics being
   used for route discovery.  These routing metrics MUST be placed in

   the Metric Container options placed before the Route Discovery
   option.

   A DIO, carrying a Route Discovery option, MUST NOT carry any Route
   Information or Prefix Information options described in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

5.3.  Joining a Temporary DAG

   When a node joins a temporary DAG advertized by a DIO carrying the
   Route Discovery option, it MUST maintain its membership in the DAG
   for the Minimum Life Time duration listed in the Route Discovery
   option.  Maintaining membership in the DAG implies remembering:

   o  The RPLInstanceID, the DODAGID and the DODAGVersionNumber for the
      temporary DAG;

   o  The node's rank in the temporary DAG as well as the address of at
      least one DAG parent;

   o  The propagation and the route constraints being used;

   o  In case of intermediate routers, the values for the routing
      metrics, along with the associated source route from the origin
      node till this node (carried in a Record Route IPv6 Extension
      Header proposed in [I-D.thubert-6man-reverse-routing-header]),
      contained in the best DIO (as per the OCP specified in the DODAG
      Configuration option) received so far.

   Although the main purpose of a temporary DAG's existence is to
   facilitate the propagation of the Route Discovery option, the
   temporary DAG MAY also be used for the Discovery Reply Object
   (defined in Section 6.1 to travel from the target node to the origin
   node.  Hence, a node in a temporary DAG SHOULD also remember the
   address of at least one DAG parent that provides, as per the node's
   knowledge, the best end-to-end route back to the origin node.  A node
   SHOULD delete information about a temporary DAG once the duration of
   its membership in the DAG has exceeded the DAG's minimum life time.

5.4.  Processing a DIO Carrying a Route Discovery Option

   The rules for DIO processing and transmission, described in Section 7
   of RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], apply to DIOs carrying a Route Discovery
   option as well except as modified in this document.

   The following rules for processing a DIO carrying a Route Discovery
   Option apply to both intermediate routers and the target nodes.

Internet-Draft          draft-dt-roll-p2p-rpl-02             August 2010


   A node MUST discard the DIO with no further processing and optionally
   log an error if any of the following conditions are true:

   o  The node does not support the OCP specified in the DODAG
      Configuration option.

   o  The node does not support one or more of the metrics contained in
      the Metric Container options in the DIO.

   o  The node does not have sufficient information to calculate the
      values of these routing metrics.

   A node MUST discard the DIO with no further processing and optionally
   log an error if any of the following conditions are found to be true
   while processing a Route Discovery option contained in the received
   DIO:

   o  The H field is set, i.e. hop-by-hop routes are desired, but the
      node cannot participate in a hop-by-hop route.

   o  The node cannot maintain its membership in the temporary DAG for
      the minimum life time duration mentioned in the Route Discovery
      option.

5.5.  Additional Processing of a DIO Carrying a Route Discovery Option
      At An Intermediate Router

   After executing the steps listed in Section 5.4, an intermediate
   router processes a received DIO carrying a Route Discovery option in
   the following manner.

   The router updates the routing metric values contained in all the
   Metric Container options inside the DIO.  The router MUST discard the
   DIO with no further processing and optionally log an error if the
   aggregated values of the routing metrics do not meet every
   propagation constraint listed in the DIO.  The router MAY optionally
   check the route constraints listed in the DIO and discard the DIO
   with no further processing if these constraints are not met.

   The router determines if this DIO is the best it has received so far
   for this temporary DAG (as per the OCP in the DODAG Configuration
   object).  If yes, the router makes a copy of the routing metric
   values contained in this DIO along with the route travelled by the
   DIO so far.  The router also resets the trickle timer and, at the
   expiry of the timer, generates a new DIO for this temporary DAG
   carrying the Route Discovery option, the best metric values it knows
   and the source route associated with these values (in a Record Route
   IPv6 extension header proposed in

   [I-D.thubert-6man-reverse-routing-header]).

5.6.  Additional Processing of a DIO Carrying a Route Discovery Option
      At The Target Node

   After executing the steps listed in Section 5.4, a target node
   processes a received DIO carrying a Route Discovery option in the
   following manner.

   The target node updates the routing metric values contained in all
   the Metric Container options inside the DIO.  The target node MUST
   discard the DIO with no further processing and optionally log an
   error if the aggregated values of the routing metrics do not meet
   every propagation and route constraint listed in the Metric Container
   options in the DIO.

   Otherwise, the target node considers the source route accumulated by
   the received DIO as good enough and MAY select it as one of the
   discovered routes.  This document does not prescribe a particular
   method for selecting routes among the good enough ones.  Suppose the
   Route Discovery option requires the target node to select "n" good
   enough routes.  The target node may select these "n" routes in any
   manner it desires.  Example selection methods include selecting the
   first "n" good enough routes it discovers or selecting the "n" best
   good enough routes (using the OCP specified in the Route Discovery
   option to do the comparison) discovered over a certain time period.

   If the target node selects at least one good enough route, it MUST
   send one or more RPL Control Messages carrying a Discovery Reply
   Object (defined in the next section) back to the origin node
   (identified by the DODAGID field in the DIO Base Object) as discussed
   in the following sections.

   A node MUST NOT forward a DIO carrying a Route Discovery option that
   lists one of its own addresses as the Target Address.

           Figure 2: Format of the Discovery Reply Object (DRO)

   This document defines a new RPL Control Message type, the Discovery
   Reply Object (DRO) with code 0x04 (to be confirmed by IANA), that
   serves the following functions:

   o  An acknowledgement from the target node to the origin node
      regarding the successful discovery of backward source routes;

   o  Carries one or more forward/bidirectional source routes from the
      target to the origin node;

   o  Establishes a hop-by-hop forward/backward/bidirectional route as
      it travels from the target to the origin node.

   The format for a Discovery Reply Object (DRO) is shown in Figure 2.
   A DRO consists of the following fields:

   o  RPLInstanceID: The RPLInstanceID of the temporary DAG used for
      route discovery.

   o  Version: The Version of the temporary DAG used for route
      discovery.

   o  D: A 2-bit field that indicates the direction of the discovered
      routes:

      *  D = 0x00: Forward;

      *  D = 0x01: Backward;

      *  D = 0x02: Bidirectional.

      This field has the same value as the corresponding field in the
      Route Discovery option.

   o  H: A flag that is set if the Discovery Reply Object is
      establishing an hop-by-hop route.  If this flag is set, the
      Discovery Reply Object also includes:

      *  The DODAGID and Target Address fields; and

      *  One Source Route option (defined in Section 6.1.1) that
         contains the remaining routers on the hop-by-hop route being
         established.

      This flag is clear if the Discovery Reply Object carries (or is an
      acknowledgement for the discovery of) one or more source routes
      contained in the Source Route options.

   o  N: A 3-bit field that indicates the number of source routes
      carried or acknowledged in the Discovery Reply Object.  This field
      MUST have value 1 if the Discovery Reply Object is establishing a
      hop-by-hop route.

   o  Reserved: These bits are reserved for future use.  These bits MUST
      be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on reception.

   o  DODAGID: The DODAGID of the temporary DAG used for route
      discovery.  The DODAGID also identifies the origin node.  This is
      an optional field that MUST be present in the Discovery Reply
      Object if H flag is set.  The RPLInstanceID, the Version and the
      DODAGID together uniquely identify the temporary DAG used for
      route discovery and can be copied from the Base Object of the DIO
      advertizing the temporary DAG.

   o  Target Address: The IPv6 address of the target node originating
      the Discovery Reply Object.  This is an optional field that MUST
      be present in the Discovery Reply Object if H flag is set.

   o  Options: The Discovery Reply Object MAY carry up to N Source Route
      options (defined in the next section) with each such option
      carrying a source route and optionally followed by a Metric
      Container option that lists the aggregated values for the routing
      metrics for the source route.

                Figure 3: Format of the Source Route Option

   The Source Route option, illustrated in Figure 3, carries a source
   route.  A Source Route option MAY be a part of the Discovery Reply
   Object.  When a Source Route option carries a complete source route
   between the origin and the target node, it MAY be immediately
   followed by a Metric Container option that contains the aggregated
   values of the routing metrics for this source route.

   A Source Route option consists of the following fields:

   o  Option Type = 0x0A (to be confirmed by IANA).

   o  Option Length = Variable, depending on the size of the Addresses
      vector.

   o  Compr: 4-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of prefix
      octets that are elided from each address.  For example, Compr
      value will be 0 if full IPv6 addresses are carried in the
      Addresses vector.

   o  Pad: 4-bit unsigned integer.  Number of octets that are used for
      padding between Address[n] and the end of the Source Route option.

   o  D: A 2-bit field that indicates the direction of the source route:

      *  D = 0x00: Forward, i.e. from the origin node to the target
         node;

      *  D = 0x01: Backward i. e., from the target node to the origin
         node;

      *  D = 0x02: Bidirectional.

Internet-Draft          draft-dt-roll-p2p-rpl-02             August 2010


      Note that the D field in a Source Route option is independent from
      the D field in the DRO containing the Source Route option.

   o  Resvd: These bits are reserved for future use.  These bits MUST be
      set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on reception.

   o  Address[1..n]: Vector of addresses, numbered 1 to n.  Each vector
      element has size (16 - Compr) octets.

   Note that the format of the Source Route option is very similar to
   that of proposed Type 4 Routing Header
   [I-D.ietf-6man-rpl-routing-header].

   A common network configuration for an RPL domain is that all routers
   within an LLN share a common prefix.  The Source Route option uses
   the Compr field to allow compaction of the Address[1..n] vector when
   all entries share the same prefix as the DODAGID or the Target
   Address of the encapsulating Discovery Reply Object.  The shared
   prefix octets are not carried within the Source Route option and each
   entry in Address[1..n] has size (16 - Compr) octets.  When Compr is
   non-zero, there may exist unused octets between the last entry,
   Address[n], and the end of the Source Route option.  The Pad field
   indicates the number of unused octets that are used for padding.
   Note that when Compr is 0, Pad MUST be null and carry a value 0.

   The Source Route option MUST NOT specify a path that visits a router
   more than once.  When generating a Source Route option, the target
   node may not know the mapping between IPv6 addresses and routers.
   Minimally, the target node MUST ensure that:

   o  The IPv6 Addresses do not appear more than once;

   o  The IPv6 addresses of the origin and the target nodes do not
      appear in the Address vector.

   Multicast addresses MUST NOT appear in a Source Route option.

6.1.2.  Processing a DRO At An Intermediate Router

   When an intermediate router receives a DRO with a clear H flag, it
   MUST forward the DRO to a parent node in the temporary DAG.

   When an intermediate router receives a DRO that has H flag set and
   contains multiple Source Route options, the router MUST drop the DRO
   with no further processing and optionally log an error message.

   When an intermediate router receives a DRO that has H flag set and
   contains a single Source Route option, the router processes the DRO

Internet-Draft          draft-dt-roll-p2p-rpl-02             August 2010


   as described in Section 6.4.

6.2.  DRO as Acknowledgement for Backward Source Routes

   After selecting one or more backward source routes, a target node
   MUST send a DRO message to the origin node as an acknowledgement for
   the discovered routes.  Such an acknowledgement helps the origin node
   determine the success of route discovery.

   A DRO, serving as an acknowledgement for backward source route
   discovery, has its D field set to 0x01 (indicating backward) while
   the H flag is cleared (indicating source route).  The N field is set
   to indicate the number of discovered backward source routes being
   acknowledged.  Such a DRO message MUST NOT contain any option.

   The target node MAY unicast this DRO message to the origin node or it
   MAY forward the DRO message to a parent in the temporary DAG.  The
   target node should take in consideration the minimum life time of the
   temporary DAG when deciding to use it to send the DRO to the origin
   node.

6.3.  DRO as Carrier of Forward/Bidirectional Source Routes

   The target node conveys the discovered forward/bidirectional source
   routes to the origin node via the Source Route options inside one or
   more DRO messages.  Such a DRO message MUST have its D field set to
   0x00 (if it carries forward routes) or 0x02 (if its carries
   bidirectional routes).  Also, the H flag MUST be cleared and the N
   field MUST indicate the number of Source Route options in the DRO.
   Each Source Route option inside the DRO MAY immediately be followed
   by a Metric Container option that carries the aggregated values of
   the relevant routing metrics for this source route.

   The target node MAY unicast this DRO message to the origin node or it
   MAY forward the DRO message to a parent in the temporary DAG.  The
   target node should take in consideration the minimum life time of the
   temporary DAG when deciding to use it to send the DRO to the origin
   node.

6.4.  Establishing Hop-by-hop Routes Via DRO

   In order to establish a hop-by-hop route, the target node sends a DRO
   message along the discovered route, which is specified in a Source
   Route option.  The D field in the DRO is set to reflect the direction
   of the discovered route.  The H bit in the DRO MUST be set and the
   DRO MUST include the DODAGID and Target Address fields.  The N field
   in the DRO MUST be set to 1.  The target node forwards the DRO to the
   next hop along the discovered route and includes the discovered



Goyal, et al.           Expires February 10, 2011              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft          draft-dt-roll-p2p-rpl-02             August 2010


   route, excluding itself and the origin node, inside the Source Route
   option in backward direction.  Thus, the D field in the Source Route
   option MUST be 0x01.

   A router receiving a DRO message MUST drop the DRO and optionally log
   an error if the router cannot establish the hop-by-hop state for the
   route or if its own address does not lie as the first element in the
   Address vector inside the Source Route option.  Otherwise, the router
   MUST establish the hop-by-hop state in the direction specified in the
   D field in the DRO.  The hop-by-hop state in the forward direction
   includes the RPLInstanceID, the DODAGID and the target node's
   address.  The hop-by-hop state in the backward direction includes the
   RPLInstanceID, the DODAGID and the origin node's address.  After
   establishing the hop-by-hop state, the router MUST remove its own
   address from the route contained in the Source Route option and
   forward the DRO to the next hop (Address[0] in the Source Route
   option).


7.  Applicability

   The route discovery mechanism described in this document may be
   invoked by an origin node when no route exists between itself and the
   target node or when the existing routes do not satisfy the desired
   performance requirements.  The mechanism is designed to discover one
   or more "good enough" routes in either direction between an origin
   and a target node.  In some application contexts, the good enough
   criteria is intrinsically known.  For example, an origin node that
   expects a target node to be less than 5 hops away may use "hop-count
   < 5" as the good enough criteria.  In other application contexts, the
   origin node may need to measure the cost of an existing route to the
   target node to determine the good enough criteria.  For example, an
   origin node that measures the total ETX of its along-DAG route to the
   target node to be 20 may use "ETX < x*20", where x is a fraction that
   the origin node decides, as the good enough criteria.  The
   functionality required to measure the cost of an existing route
   between the origin and the target node will be described in a
   separate document.  In case, there is no existing route between the
   origin and target nodes or the cost measurement for the existing
   route fails, the origin node will have to guess the good enough
   criteria for the initial route discovery.  Once, the initial route
   discovery succeeds or fails, the origin node will have a better
   estimate for the good enough criteria to be used in the subsequent
   route discovery.

   This document describes an on-demand discovery mechanism for P2P
   routes that is complimentary to the proactive routes offered by RPL
   base functionality.  The mechanism described in this document may

   result in discovery of better P2P routes than the ones available
   along a DAG designed to optimize routing cost to the DAG's root.  The
   improvement in route quality depends on a number of factors including
   the network topology, the routing metrics in use and the prevalent
   conditions in the network.  A network designer may take in
   consideration both the benefits (potentially better routes; no need
   to maintain routes proactively) and costs (control messages generated
   during the route discovery process) when using this mechanism.

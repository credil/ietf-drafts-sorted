Whilst a client could choose to use a URL value instead, the problem then becomes where and how the client discovers an appropriate URL to use and how it ensures that only those attendees listed in the event or task are able to access it.</t>      <t>This specification solves this problem by having the client send the attachment to the server, separately from the iCalendar data, and the server takes care of adding appropriate "ATTACH" properties in the iCalendar data as well as managing access privileges . The server can also provide additional information to the client about each attachment in the iCalendar data, such as the size and an identifier.</t>    </section>    <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.</t>      <t>The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of <xref target='RFC5234' /> as used by <xref target='RFC5545'>iCalendar</xref>.

Attendees of          the meeting are granted read access to the newly created          attachment resource. Their own copy of the meeting is updated to include the          new ATTACH property pointing to the attachment resource and they are notified          of the change via their scheduling inbox.        </t>        <figure>          <preamble>            &gt;&gt; Request &lt;&lt;          </preamble>          <artwork><![CDATA[POST /events/65.ics?action=attachment-add HTTP/1.1Host: cal.example.comContent-Type: text/html; charset="utf-8"Content-Disposition:attachment;filename=agenda.htmlContent-Length: xxxxPrefer: return-representation<html>  <body>    <h1>Agenda</h1>    <p>As usual</p>  </body></html>]]>          </artwork>        </figure>        <figure>          <preamble>            &gt;&gt; Response &lt;&lt;          </preamble>          <artwork><![CDATA[HTTP/1.1 201 CreatedContent-Type: text/calendar; charset="utf-8"Content-Length: yyyyContent-Location: http://cal.example.com/events/65.icsETag: "123456789-000-111"Cal-Managed-ID: 97SBEGIN:VCALENDARVERSION:2.0PRODID:-//Example Corp.//CalDAV Server//ENBEGIN:VTIMEZONELAST-MODIFIED:20040110T032845ZTZID:America/MontrealBEGIN:DAYLIGHTDTSTART:20000404T020000RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=1SU;BYMONTH=4TZNAME:EDTTZOFFSETFROM:-0500TZOFFSETTO:-0400END:DAYLIGHTBEGIN:STANDARDDTSTART:20001026T020000RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=-1SU;BYMONTH=10TZNAME:ESTTZOFFSETFROM:-0400TZOFFSETTO:-0500END:STANDARDEND:VTIMEZONEBEGIN:VEVENTUID:20010712T182145Z-123401@example.comDTSTAMP:20120201T203412ZDTSTART;TZID=America/Montreal:20120206T100000DURATION:PT1HRRULE:FREQ=WEEKLYSUMMARY:Planning MeetingORGANIZER:mailto:cyrus@example.comATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;PARTSTAT=ACCEPTED:mailto:cyrus@exampl e.comATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;PARTSTAT=ACCEPTED:mailto:arnaudq@exam ple.comATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;PARTSTAT=NEEDS-ACTION:mailto:mike@exa mple.comATTACH;MANAGED-ID=97S;FMTTYPE=text/html;SIZE=xxxx; FILENAME=agenda.html:https://cal.example.com/attach/65/34X22REND:VEVENTEND:VCALENDAR]]>          </artwork>        </figure>        <t>          The organizer has a more specific agenda for the 20th of February meeting.          It is added to that particular instance of the meeting by specifying the          rid parameter.        </t>        <figure>          <preamble>            &gt;&gt; Request &lt;&lt;          </preamble>          <artwork><![CDATA[POST /events/65.ics?action=attachment-add&rid=20120220T100000 HTTP/1.1Host: cal.example.comContent-Type: text/html; charset="utf-8"Content-Disposition:attachment;filename=agenda0220.htmlContent-Length: xxxxPrefer: return-representation<html>  <body>    <h1>Agenda</h1>    <p>Something different, for a change</p>  </body></html>]]>          </artwork>        </figure>        <figure>          <preamble>            &gt;&gt; Response &lt;&lt;          </preamble>          <artwork><![CDATA[HTTP/1.1 201 CreatedContent-Type: text/calendar; charset="utf-8"Content-Length: yyyyContent-Location: http://cal.example.com/events/65.icsETag: "123456789-000-222"Cal-Managed-ID: 33225BEGIN:VCALENDARVERSION:2.0PRODID:-//Example Corp.//CalDAV Server//ENBEGIN:VTIMEZONELAST-MODIFIED:20040110T032845ZTZID:America/MontrealBEGIN:DAYLIGHTDTSTART:20000404T020000RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=1SU;BYMONTH=4TZNAME:EDTTZOFFSETFROM:-0500TZOFFSETTO:-0400END:DAYLIGHTBEGIN:STANDARDDTSTART:20001026T020000RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=-1SU;BYMONTH=10TZNAME:ESTTZOFFSETFROM:-0400TZOFFSETTO:-0500END:STANDARDEND:VTIMEZONEBEGIN:VEVENTUID:20010712T182145Z-123401@example.comDTSTAMP:20120201T203412ZDTSTART;TZID=America/Montreal:20120206T100000DURATION:PT1HRRULE:FREQ=WEEKLYSUMMARY:Planning MeetingORGANIZER:mailto:cyrus@example.comATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;PARTSTAT=ACCEPTED:mailto:cyrus@exampl e.comATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;PARTSTAT=ACCEPTED:mailto:arnaudq@exam ple.comATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;PARTSTAT=NEEDS-ACTION:mailto:mike@exa mple.comATTACH;MANAGED-ID=97S;FMTTYPE=text/html;SIZE=xxxx; FILENAME=agenda.html:https://cal.example.com/attach/65/34X22REND:VEVENTBEGIN:VEVENTUID:20010712T182145Z-123401@example.comRECURRENCE-ID;TZID=America/Montreal:20120220T100000DTSTAMP:20120201T203412ZDTSTART;TZID=America/Montreal:20120220T100000DURATION:PT1HSUMMARY:Planning MeetingORGANIZER:mailto:cyrus@example.comATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;PARTSTAT=ACCEPTED:mailto:cyrus@example. comATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;PARTSTAT=ACCEPTED:mailto:arnaudq@exampl e.comATTENDEE;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;PARTSTAT=NEEDS-ACTION:mailto:mike@examp le.comATTACH;MANAGED-ID=33225;FMTTYPE=text/html;SIZE=xxxx; FILENAME=agenda0220.html:https://cal.example.com/attach/65/FGZ225END:VEVENTEND:VCALENDAR]]>          </artwork>        </figure>    </section>  </back></rfc>

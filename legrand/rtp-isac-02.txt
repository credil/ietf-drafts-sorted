2. iSAC Codec Description 

   The iSAC codec is an adaptive wideband speech and audio codec that 
   operates with short delay, making it suitable for high quality real 
   time communication.  It is specially designed to deliver wideband 
   speech quality in both low and medium bit rate applications.  It also 
   handles non-speech audio well, such as music and background noise 
   [5]. 

   The iSAC codec compresses speech frames of 16 kHz, 16-bit sampled 
   input speech, each frame containing 30 or 60 ms of speech. 

   The codec runs in one of two different modes called channel-adaptive 
   mode and channel-independent mode.  In both modes iSAC is aiming at a 
   target bit rate, which is neither the average nor the maximum bit 
   rate that will be reach by iSAC, but corresponds to the average bit 
   rate during peaks in speech activity.  The bit rate will sometimes 
   exceed the target bit rate, but most of the time will be below.  The 
   average bit rate obtained is on average about a factor of 1.4 times 
   lower than the target bit rate.   

   In channel-adaptive mode the target bit rate is adapted to give a bit 
   rate corresponding to the available bandwidth on the channel.  The 
   available bandwidth is constantly estimated at the receiving iSAC and 
   signaled in-band in the iSAC bit stream.  Even at dial-up modem data 
   rates (including IP, UDP, and RTP overhead) iSAC delivers high 
   quality by automatically adjusting transmission rates to give the 
   best possible listening experience over the available bandwidth.  The 
   default initial target bit rate is 20000 bits per second in channel-
   adaptive mode. 

   In channel-independent mode a target bit rate has to be provided to 
   iSAC prior to encoding. 

   After encoding the speech signal the iSAC coder uses lossless coding 
   to further reduce the size of each packet, and hence the total bit 
   rate used. 

   The adaptation and the lossless coding described above both result in 
   a variation of packet size, depending both of the nature of speech 
   and the available bandwidth.  Therefore the iSAC codec operates at 
   transmission rates from about 10 kbps to about 32 kbps.   

   The main characteristics can be summarized as follows: 

   o  Wideband, 16 kHz, speech and audio codec

   o  Variable bit rate, which depends on the input signal 

   o  Adaptive rate with two modes: channel-adaptive or channel-
      independent mode 

   o  Bit rate range from around 10 kbps to 32 kbps 

   o  Operates on 30 or 60 ms of speech 

3. RTP Payload Format 

   The iSAC codec uses a sampling rate clock of 16 kHz, so the RTP 
   timestamp MUST be in units of 1/16000 of a second. 

   The RTP payload for iSAC has the format shown in Figure 1.  No 
   additional header fields specific to this payload format are   
   required.  For RTP based transportation of iSAC encoded audio, the   
   standard RTP header [2] is followed by one payload data block.

3.1. iSAC Payload Format 

   The iSAC payload block consists of a payload header and one or two 
   encoded 30 ms speech frames.  The iSAC payload is generated in the 
   following manner: 

   o  Parameters representing one or two 30 ms frames of speech data are 
      determined by the encoder.  The parameters are quantized to 
      generate encoded data corresponding to the one or two speech 
      frames.  The length of the encoded data is variable and depends on 
      the signal characteristics and the target bit rate. 

   o  The payload header is generated (described in Section 3.2) and 
      added before the encoded parameter data for the speech frame(s).

   o  Lossless coding is applied to the complete iSAC payload block, 
      including payload header, to generate a compressed payload.  The 
      length depends on the length of the data generated to represent 
      the speech and the effectiveness of the lossless coding. 

   No part of the payload header or the encoded speech data can be 
   retrieved without partly or fully decoding the packet. 

   The following figure shows an iSAC payload block containing 60 ms of 
   encoded speech data:

3.2. Payload Header 

   The payload header holds information for the receiver about the 
   available bandwidth (BEI), and the length of the speech data in the 
   current payload (FL).  The header has the format defined in Figure 3.    
   Note that the size of the header can vary due to the lossless 
   encoding described in section 2 and in section 3.1.  Also note that 
   the BEI is always estimated and transmitted, even if iSAC runs in 
   channel-independent mode.

      payload, given in number of speech samples.  Valid frame lengths

3.3. Encoded Speech Data 

   The iSAC encoded speech data consist of parameters representing one 
   or two frames of 30 ms speech.  The length of the speech data is 
   signaled in the header (in number of samples), and the length may

   change at any time during a session.  In channel-adaptive mode the 
   length is changed to best utilize the available bandwidth. 

   The iSAC payload is padded to whole octets, and has a variable length 
   depending on the input source signal, number of 30 ms speech frames, 
   and target bit rate.  

   The number of octets used to describe one frame of 30 ms speech 
   typically varies from around 50 to around 120 octets.  For the case 
   of 60 ms speech (two 30 ms speech frames), the number of octets 
   varies from around 100 to around 240 octets.  The absolute maximum 
   allowed payload length is 400 octets.  The user can choose to lower 
   the maximum allowed payload length.  Minimum value is 100 octets.  It 
   is possible for the user to choose a maximum bit rate instead of a 
   maximum payload length.  The maximum payload length is then dependent 
   on the length of the speech data represented in the payload (30 or 60 
   ms).  Possible maximum rates are in the range of 32000 to 53400 bits 
   per second.  

   The sensitivity to bit errors is equal for all bits in the payload. 

3.4. Multiple iSAC frames in an RTP packet 

   More than one iSAC payload block MUST NOT be included in an RTP 
   packet by a sender. 

   Further, iSAC payload blocks MUST NOT be split between RTP packets. 

4. IANA Considerations

   o  ibitrate: The parameter indicates the upper bound of the initial 
      target bit rate the device would like to receive.  For channel-
      adaptive mode, the target bit rate may vary with time; for 
      channel-independent mode, the target bit rate will remain at that 
      level unless instructed otherwise.  An acceptable value for 
      ibitrate is in the range of 20000 to 32000 (bits per second). 

   o  maxbitrate: The parameter indicates the maximum bit rate the 
      endpoint expects to receive.  The recipient of this parameter 
      SHOULD NOT transmit at a higher bit rate.   

   Encoding considerations:  

      This media format is framed and binary. 

   Security considerations:  

      See section 6.  

   Interoperability considerations: None 

   Published specification: 

   Applications which use this media type: 

      This media type is suitable for use in numerous applications 
      needing to transport encoded voice or other audio.  Some examples 
      include Voice over IP, Streaming Media, Voice Messaging, and 
      Conferencing.

      This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined 
      for transfer via RTP [2].  Transport within other framing 
      protocols is not defined at this time.

5. Mapping to SDP Parameters 

   The information carried in the media type specification has a 
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) 
   [4], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is 
   used to specify sessions employing the iSAC codec, the mapping is as 
   follows: 

   o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name. 

   o  The media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as      
      the encoding name. 

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by      
      copying them directly from the media type string as a semicolon      
      separated list of parameter=value pairs. 

   The optional parameter ibitrate MUST NOT be higher than the parameter 
   maxbitrate. 

   The iSAC parameters in an SDP offer are completely independent from 
   those in the SDP answer.  For both ibitrate and maxbitrate it is 
   legal for the answer to contain a value that is different than what 
   is provided in an offer.  The parameter may be present in the answer, 
   even if absent in the offer. 

   When conveying information by SDP, the encoding name SHALL be "isac"   
   (the same as the media subtype). 

5.1. Example Initial Target Bit Rate 

   The offer indicates that it wishes to receive a bitstream with an 
   initial target rate of 20000 bits per second.  The remote party MAY 
   change its initial target rate to the requested value. 

      m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 98 
      a=rtpmap: 98 isac/16000 
      a=fmtp:98 ibitrate=20000

5.2. Example Max Bit Rate 

   The offer indicates that it wishes to receive a bitstream with an 
   initial target rate of 20000 bits per second, and a maximum bit rate 
   of 45000 bits per second.  The remote party MAY change its initial 
   target rate and SHOULD NOT transmit at a higher rate than 45000. 

      m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 98 
      a=rtpmap: 98 isac/16000 
      a=fmtp:98 ibitrate=20000;maxrate=45000 

6. Security Considerations 

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the general security considerations discussed in RFC 
   3550 [2]. 

   As this format transports encoded speech, the main security issues 
   include confidentiality and authentication of the speech itself.  The 
   payload format itself does not have any built-in security mechanisms.  
   External mechanisms, such as SRTP [3], MAY be used.

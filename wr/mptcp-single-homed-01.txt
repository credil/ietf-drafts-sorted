           Multipath TCP Support for Single-homed End-systems
                     draft-wr-mptcp-single-homed-01

Abstract

   Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at the end-
   systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained by
   different ISPs.  While this scenario is certainly becoming
   increasingly a reality (e.g. mobile devices), currently most end-
   systems are single-homed (e.g. residential broadband customers).
   This memo describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to
   multipath TCP via autoconfiguration that are not available at the
   end-systems but somewhere within the network.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF is specifying a multipath TCP (MPTCP) architecture and
   protocol where end-systems operate a modified standard TCP stack
   which allows packets of the same TCP connection to be sent via
   different paths to an MPTCP-capable destination
   ([I-D.ietf-mptcp-multiaddressed], [RFC6182]) where paths are defined
   by sets of source and destination IP addresses.  Using multiple paths
   has a number of benefits such as an increased reliability of the
   transport connection and an effect known as resource pooling
   [resource_pooling].  Most end-systems today do not have multiple
   paths/interfaces available in order to make use of multipath TCP,
   however further within the network multiple paths are the norm rather
   than the exception.  This memo therefore describes a way how a
   network element that is multi-homed can somehow "extend" this multi-
   homing to end-systems, providing the multipath TCP benefits starting
   at that network element.

   In order to illustrate the general mechanism we make use of a simple
   reference scenario shown in Figure 1.

                       Figure 1: Reference Scenario

   The scenario in Figure 1 depicts e.g. a possible SOHO or enterprise
   setup where a gateway/router is connected to two ISPs and a DHCP
   server gives out leases to hosts connected to the local network.
   Note that both, the gateway and the DHCP server could be on the same
   device (similar to current home gateway implementations).

   The host is running a multipath-capable IP stack, however it only has
   a single interface.  The method described in the following sections
   is to let the host make use of the gateway's two interfaces without
   requiring modifications to the MPTCP implementation.  In particular,
   we describe a way to autoconfigure the host.

2.  General Operation

   Multipath TCP distinguishes paths by their source and destination IP
   addresses.  Assuming a certain level of path diversity in the
   Internet, using different source and destination IP addresses for a
   given subflow of a multipath TCP connection will, with a certain
   probability, result in different paths taken by packets of different
   subflows.  Even in case subflows share a common bottleneck, the
   proposed multipath congestion control algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-mptcp-congestion] will make sure that multipath TCP will
   play nicely with regular TCP flows.

   In order to not require changes to the TCP implementation, we keep
   the above assumptions multipath TCP makes, i.e. working with
   different IP addresses to use different paths.  Since the end-system
   is single-homed, all IP addresses are bound to the same physical
   interface.  In our reference scenario in Figure 1, the host would
   receive more than one RFC1918 [RFC1918] private IP address from the
   DHCP server as depicted in Figure 2.

                        Figure 2: Gateway internals

   The gateway that is shown in Figure 2 has received two IP addresses,
   one from each ISP that it is connected to.  The NAT that the gateway
   is implementing needs to "map" each private IP address of the host
   consistently to a one of the addresses, each private IP to a
   different public IP.  Packets sent by the host to the gateway are
   then routed based on the source address found in the packets as
   illustrated in the figure.  In other words, depending on the source
   address of the host, the packets will either go through ISP 1 or ISP
   2 and TCP will balance the traffic across those two links using its
   built-in congestion control mechanism.

   The way the gateway has received it's public IP addresses is not

   relevant.  It could be via via DHCP, IPCP or static configuration.
   In order to configure the host via DHCP, we propose two new DHCP
   options.  The first option "mp-avail" will be sent by single-homed
   multipath TCP-enabled clients in the "Parameter Request List".  This
   will show the DHCP server that the client is multipath-capable.  The
   DHCP server will answer with "mp-avail" and the option value is set
   to the number of additional interfaces the gateway can offer to the
   client (in our reference scenario that value would be 1; see
   Figure 3).

                      Figure 3: DHCP Sequence Diagram

   Upon receipt of the "mp-avail" option from the server, the client can
   create up to n virtual interfaces, where n is the option value.  Each
   virtual interface will contact the DHCP server and will include the
   "mp-range" option.  The option value will tell the DHCP server that
   the client is requesting an IP out of an IP range that the gateway
   will be forwarding through a different interface.

   The above has been implemented using the ISC DHCP server and client
   version 4.2.1 and the multipath TCP kernel patch 0.5 and a 2.6.36
   Linux kernel.

   scenarios such as DSL broadband customers or mobile phones are
   conceivable as well.  As an example, take the DSL scenario.  The home
   gateway could be provided with multiple IP addresses using extensions
   to IPCP.  The home gateway in turn can then implement the DHCP server
   and gateway functionality as described before.  More scenarios will
   be described in future versions of this document.


4.  Alternative approaches

   One alternative is that a DHCP server always sends n offers, where n
   is the number of interfaces at the gateway to different ISPs.  The
   client could then accept all or a subset of these offers.  This
   approach seems interesting in environments where there are multiple
   DHCP servers, one for each ISP connection (think multiple
   homegateways).  However, accepting multiple offers based on a single
   DHCP request is not standard's compliant behavior.  Also, to cater
   for a scenario that only contains a single DHCP server, server
   changes are needed in any case.  Finally, correct routing is not
   always guaranteed in these scenarios.

   An interesting alternative is the use of ECMP at the gateway for load
   distribution and let MPTCP use different port numbers for subflows.
   Assuming that ECMP is available at the gateway, this approach would
   work fine today.  The only drawback of the approach is that it
   involves a little trial and error to find port numbers that actually
   hash to different paths used by ECMP.

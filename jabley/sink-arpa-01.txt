       The Eternal Non-Existence of SINK.ARPA (and other stories)
                       draft-jabley-sink-arpa-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a fully-qualified domain name in the Domain
   Name System (DNS) that can be relied upon never to exist.  The
   availability of a name in the DNS which is guaranteed not to exist
   has useful operational applications.

   This document also provides a procedural framework for other names
   that have special characteristics to be reserved, and for those
   special characteristics to be codified as modifications to the normal
   ARPA administration process.

Internet-Draft   The Eternal Non-Existence of SINK.ARPA    November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].
   This document has three purposes:

   1.  to create a new IANA registry called "ARPA Reserved Names" (see
       Section 3);

   2.  to define the special considerations of a single name SINK.ARPA,
       a name which is defined never to exist (see Section 2);

   3.  to allow the procedures by which the ARPA zone is maintained, as
       documented in [RFC3172], to be modified for names present in the
       ARPA Reserved Names registry according to the special
       characteristics of those names (see Section 4).

2.  SINK.ARPA

   The special considerations for the name SINK.ARPA are that the name
   SINK.ARPA shall be guaranteed never to have any resource records
   associated with it.  That is, the domain does not exist and queries
   for it will result in name errors (NXDOMAIN).  The reliable non-
   existence of a globally-consistent and formally-defined name has some
   operational utility.

   Various top-level domains are reserved by [RFC2606], including
   "INVALID".  The use of "INVALID" as a codified, non-existent domain
   was considered.  However:

   o  INVALID is poorly characterised from a DNS perspective in
      [RFC2606]; that is, the specification that INVALID does not exist
      as a Top Level Domain (TLD) is imprecise given the various uses of
      the term TLD in policy forums;

   o  the contents of the root zone are derived by interaction with many
      inter-related policy-making bodies, whereas the administrative and
      technical processes relating to the ARPA zone are much more
      clearly defined in an IETF context;

   o  the use of ARPA for purposes of operational infrastructure (and,
      by inference, the explicit non-use of a particular name in ARPA)
      is consistent with the purpose of that zone, as described in
      [RFC3172].

   This document specifies that any request which would cause the name
   SINK.ARPA to exist in the DNS should be denied.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document directs the IANA to create a registry as follows:

   +-------------------------+----------------------------------------+
   | Parameter               | Value                                  |
   +-------------------------+----------------------------------------+
   | Registry Name           | ARPA Reserved Names                    |
   |                         |                                        |
   | Reference               | This document (RFCXXXX) Section 4      |
   |                         |                                        |
   | Registration Procedures | IETF Standards Action and IAB approval |
   +-------------------------+----------------------------------------+

   The initial registry contents should be as follows:

   +-----------+----------------------+---------+----------------------+
   | Name      | Purpose              | RRTypes | Reference            |
   +-----------+----------------------+---------+----------------------+
   | SINK.ARPA | Definitively         | NONE    | This document        |
   |           | non-existent name    |         | (RFCXXXX) Section 2  |
   +-----------+----------------------+---------+----------------------+

4.  Administration of the ARPA Domain

   The management guidelines and operational requirements of the ARPA
   domain is described in [RFC3172].  Requests to modify the ARPA zone
   are specified in standards-track documents which, when approved by
   the IESG and the IAB are sent to the IANA for implementation.  This
   document updates the procedures described in that document as
   follows:

4.1.  Criteria for "arpa" Sub-domains

   Names which are included in the IANA registry "ARPA Reserved Names"
   are reserved and require special consideration.  The nature of that
   special consideration is specified by reference within the ARPA
   Reserved Names registry.

5.  IAB Considerations

   IAB review and approval of this document is required, given the IAB's
   technical and administrative function in the approval of changes to
   the ARPA zone.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document institutionalises a single name in the DNS to which
   unwanted traffic can be directed.  This name, SINK.ARPA, is specified
   in this document not to exist in the DNS.  If address records for
   SINK.ARPA were to be introduced by exploiting insecurities in the
   DNS, however, then those addresses would receive that unwanted
   traffic.  This might provide a leak of private information to a third
   party, or have other unwelcome consequences.

   The non-existence of SINK.ARPA will be cryptographically verifiable
   when the ARPA zone is signed.

Appendix A.  Editorial Notes

   This section (and sub-sections) to be removed prior to publication.

A.1.  On the name SINK.ARPA

   The name SINK.ARPA has been chosen as an editorial convenience:
   having a name is more convenient than not having a name when
   discussing the general proposal.  No doubt other names would do the
   job just as well.

A.2.  Change History

   00 Initial draft.

   01 Updated following feedback from Alfred Hoenes.

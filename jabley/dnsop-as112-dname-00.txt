Abstract

   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses that
   are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in
   RFC 1918 for private use within individual sites.

   Devices in such environments may occasionally originate Domain Name
   System (DNS) queries (so-called "reverse lookups") corresponding to
   those private-use addresses.  Since the addresses concerned have only
   local significance, it is good practice for site administrators to
   ensure that such queries are answered locally.  However, it is not
   uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the
   public DNS instead of being answered within the site.

   It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to
   such queries.  In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use
   addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of
   such queries is large and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide
   a distributed sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on
   the IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers.  The AS112 project is named
   after the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that was assigned to it.

   The AS112 project does not accommodate the addition and removal of
   DNS zones elegantly.  Since additional zones of definitively local
   significance are known to exist, this presents a problem.  This
   document describes modifications to the deployment and use of AS112
   infrastructure that will allow zones to be added and dropped much
   more easily.

Internet-Draft        AS112 Redirection using DNAME            June 2013


1.  Introduction

   The AS112 project is described in detail in [RFC6304].

   The AS112 nameservers (PRISONER.IANA.ORG, BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG and
   BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG) are required to answer authoritatively for each
   and every zone that is delegated to them.

   If a zone is delegated to AS112 nameservers without those nameservers
   being configured ahead of time to answer authoritatively for that
   zone, there is a detrimental impact on clients following referrals
   for queries within that zone.  This misconfiguration is colloquially
   known as a "lame delegation".

   AS112 nameserver operators are only loosely-coordinated, and hence
   adding support for a new zone (or, correspondingly, removing support
   for a zone that is no longer delegated to the AS112 nameservers) is
   difficult to accomplish with accuracy; testing AS112 nameservers
   remotely to see whether they are configured to answer authoritatively
   for a particular zone is similarly challenging since AS112 nodes are
   distributed using anycast [RFC4786].

   This document proposes that instead of delegating individual zones to
   AS112 nameservers, DNAME [RFC6672] redirection be used instead.  This
   approach has the advantage that query traffic for arbitrary parts of
   the namespace can be directed to AS112 servers without those servers
   having to be reconfigured every time a zone is added or removed.

2.  Design Overview

   A new zone, EMPTY.AS112.ARPA, is delegated to a single nameserver
   BLACKHOLE.AS112.ARPA (IPv4 address TBAv4-1, IPv6 address TBAv6-1).

   The IPv4 address TBAv4-1 has been assigned by the IANA such that the
   address is coverable by a single IPv4 /24 prefix, and that no other
   address covered by that prefix is in use.  The IPv6 address TBAv6-1
   has been similarly assigned such that no other address within a
   covering /48 is in use.  This addressing plan accommodates the
   anycast distribution of the BLACKHOLE.AS112.ARPA service using a
   single IPv4 service prefix and a single IPv6 service prefix.  See
   [RFC4786] for more discussion of anycast service distribution; see
   Section 8 for the specific requests this document makes of the IANA.

   Some or all of the existing AS112 nodes should be extended to support
   these new nameserver addresses, and to host the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA
   zone.  See Section 3.1 for guidance to AS112 server operators.

   Each part of the DNS namespace for which it is desirable to sink
   queries at AS112 nameservers should be redirected to the
   EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone using DNAME [RFC6672].  See Section 3.2 for
   guidance to zone administrators.

3.  AS112 Operations

3.1.  Extensions to Support DNAME Redirection

   The guidance provided in [RFC6304] is extended to include
   configuration of the TBAv4-1, and TBAv6-1 addresses, and the
   corresponding announcement of covering routes for those addresses,
   and to host the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.

   IPv4-only AS112 nodes should only configure the TBAv4-1 nameserver
   address; IPv6-only AS112 nodes should only configure the TBAv6-1
   nameserver address.

   It is only necessary for a single AS112 server operator to implement
   these extensions for this mechanism to function as intended.  It is
   beneficial if many more than one AS112 server operators make these
   changes, however, since that provides for greater distribution and
   capacity for the nameservers serving the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.  It
   is not necessary for all AS112 server operators to make these changes
   for the mechanism to be viable.

   Detailed instructions for the implementation of these extensions is
   included in Appendix A.

3.2.  Redirection of Query Traffic to AS112 Servers

   Once the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone has been deployed using the
   nameservers described in Section 3.1, redirections may be installed
   in the DNS namespace for queries that are intended to be answered by
   the AS112 infrastructure.

   For example, reverse queries corresponding to TEST-NET-1
   (192.0.2.0/24) [RFC5737] could be redirected to AS112 nameservers by
   installing a DNAME resource record in the 192.IN-ADDR.ARPA zone, as
   illustrated in Figure 1.

     @ORIGIN 192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.
     ...
     2.0.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IN  DNAME  EMPTY.AS112.ARPA.
     ...

                                 Figure 1

   There is no practical limit to the number of redirections that can be
   configured in this fashion.  Redirection of a particular part of the
   namespace to EMPTY.AS112.ARPA can be removed at any time, under the
   control of the administrators of the corresponding part of the DNS
   namespace.  No changes to deployed AS112 nodes incorporating the

   extensions described in this document are required to support
   additional redirections.  A list of possible candidates for AS112
   redirection can be found in Section 5.

   DNAME resource records deployed for this purpose can be signed with
   DNSSEC [RFC4033], providing a secure means of authenticating the
   legitimacy of each redirection.

4.  Continuity of AS112 Operations

   Existing guidance to AS112 server operators to accept and respond to
   queries directed at the PRISONER.IANA.ORG, BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG and
   BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG nameservers should continue to be followed, and
   no changes to the delegation of existing zones hosted on AS112
   servers should occur.  These measures are intended to provide
   continuity of operations for zones currently delegated to AS112
   servers and avoid any accidental client impact due to the changes
   proposed in this document.

   Once it has become empirically and quantitatively clear that the
   EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone is well-hosted to the extent that it is thought
   that the existing, unmodified AS112 servers host 10.IN-ADDR.ARPA, the
   decision might be made to replace the delegation of those [RFC1918]
   zones with DNAME redirection.  Once implemented, the
   PRISONER.IANA.ORG, BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG and BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG
   nameservers could be retired.  This document gives no such direction
   to the IANA, however.

5.  Candidate Zones for AS112 Redirection

   All zones listed in [RFC6303] are candidates for AS112 redirection.
   No doubt there are many others that are worth mentioning.  Future
   revisions of this draft should mention them.

   This document is concerned with provision of the AS112 redirection
   service, and does not specify that any particular AS112 redirection
   be put in place.

6.  DNAME Deployment Considerations

   DNAME was specified a significant time following the original
   implementations of [RFC1035], and hence universal deployment cannot
   be expected.  [RFC6672] specifies a fall-back mechanism which makes
   use of synthesised CNAME RRSets for this reason.

   It is a fundamental design requirement of AS112 service that
   responses be cached.  We can safely declare DNAME support on the
   authoritative server to be a prerequisite for DNAME redirection, but
   the cases where individual elements in resolver chains do not support
   DNAME processing deserve closer examination.

   The expected behaviour when a DNAME response is supplied to a
   resolver that does not support DNAME is that the accompanying,
   synthesised CNAME will be accepted and cached.  Re-query frequency
   will be determined by the TTLs returned by the DNAME-responding
   authoritative servers.

   Resolution of the CNAME target is straightforward and functions
   exactly as the AS112 project has operated since it was deployed.  The
   negative caching [RFC2308] of the CNAME target follows the parameters
   defined in the target zone, EMPTY.AS112.ARPA.  This has the side-
   effects that all redirected names ultimately landing on an AS112 node
   will be negatively-cached with the same parameters, but this lack of
   flexibility seems non-contraversial; the effect of reducing the
   negative cache TTL would be increased query volume on the AS112 node
   operator concerned, and hence controls seem well-alligned with
   operation.

   Validating resolvers (i.e. those requesting and processing DNSSEC
   [RFC4033] metadata) are required to implement DNAME, and hence should
   not make use of synthesised CNAME RRs.  The lack of signature over a
   received CNAME RR should hence not limit the ability to sign the
   redirection point, and for those signatures to be validated.

   In the case where a recursive server implements DNAME, but DNAME is
   not implemented in a stub resolver, CNAME synthesis will again
   provide a viable path.

   DNAME support on AS112 nodes themselves is never required under this
   proposal.

7.  IAB Considerations

   This document proposes a delegation within the ARPA domain, and, in
   accordance with [RFC3172], IAB review and approval of the delegation
   of AS112.ARPA as described in Section 8 is required.

   Once IAB approval has been obtained, this section may be removed
   prior to publication or updated to include text that confirms the
   IAB's decision, at the IAB's discretion.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Address Assignment

   The IANA is requested to assign one IPv4 /24 netblock and one IPv6
   /48 netblock that, to the best of their knowledge, should be suitable
   for announcement as a single IPv4 /24 prefix and a single IPv6 prefix
   on the global Internet, respectively.

   Once assigned, all occurrences of TBAv4 in this document should be
   replaced by the IPv4 netblock assigned, in conventional notation.
   Occurrences of TBAv4-1 should be replaced with an address from the
   netblock with lowest octet set to 1.  Similarly, all occurrences of
   TBAv6 in this document should be replaced by the IPv6 netblock
   assigned, in conventional notation, and TBAv6-1 replaced with an
   address from that netblock with the lowest 48 bits set to the value
   1.  Once those changes are made, this paragraph may be removed prior
   to publication.

   The netblocks assigned by the IANA for this purpose are TBAv4 and
   TBAv6.

8.2.  Hosting of AS112.ARPA

   The IANA is requested to host and sign the zone AS112.ARPA using
   nameservers and DNSSEC signing infrastructure of their choosing, as
   shown in Figure 2.  SOA RDATA may be adjusted by the IANA to suit
   their operational requirements.

    $ORIGIN AS112.ARPA.

                                    1209600         ; expire

8.3.  Delegation of AS112.ARPA

   Once the AS112.ARPA zone is being hosted in production, the IANA is
   requested to arrange delegation from the ARPA zone according to
   normal IANA procedure for ARPA zone management, to the nameservers
   used in carrying out the direction in Section 8.2.  The following
   metadata is suggested for the delegation, but may be changed by the
   IANA if required:

Internet-Draft        AS112 Redirection using DNAME            June 2013


Appendix A.  Updates to RFC6304

   The following changes are required to [RFC6304] to provide support
   for AS112 redirection.  It is proposed that a successor document to
   [RFC6304] be prepared for joint publication with this document in the
   interests of providing clear advice to prospective new AS112
   operators.  The following sub-sections are hence provided mainly only
   to describe the scope of the changes required for 6304bis, and are
   not intended for publication in this document.  References to this
   section in this document should ultimately be replaced with
   references to 6304bis.

A.1.  Changes to Section 2.1, Zones

   The list of zones that the AS112 nameserver should answer
   authoritatively for is extended to include EMPTY.AS112.ARPA.

A.2.  Changes to Section 2.2, Nameservers

   The nameserver BLACKHOLE.AS112.ARPA (IPv4 address TBAv4-1, IPv6
   address TBAv6-1) is added to the list of nameserver addresses that
   the AS112 node should support.  The IPv4 prefix TBAv4/24 and the IPv6
   prefix TBAv6/48 are added as new prefixes to be originated.

A.3.  Changes to Section 3.4, Routing Software

   The sample configuration provided in this section is extended to
   accommodate the IPv4 and IPv6 service prefixes associated with AS112
   redirection, TBAv4/24 and TBAv6/48, respectively.

A.4.  Changes to Section 3.5, DNS Software

   The sample configuration provided in this section is extended to
   accommodate the TBAv4-1 and TBAv6-1 addresses and the
   EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.  The contents of the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone
   should be specified (nameservers differ from that included as
   "db.empty").

A.5.  Changes to Section 3.6, Testing a Newly Installed Node

   Testing should be extended to test for correct hosting of the
   EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.

A.6.  Changes to Section 6, On the Future of AS112 Nodes

   A reference to this document should be included.

A.7.  Changes to Section 8, Security Considerations

   Mention should be made that AS112 redirection, as specified in this
   document, supports DNSSEC in the sense that the DNAME records which
   signal the redirection can be signed.

A.8.  Changes to Appendix A, History

   A reference to this document should be included.

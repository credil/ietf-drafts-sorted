Abstract

   This document describes the architecture of a Suite B compliant
   implementation of the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol and the
   Secure Shell Authentication Protocol.  Suite B secure shell makes use
   of elliptic curve Diffie-Hellmann (ECDH) key agreement, the elliptic
   curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), the Advanced Encryption
   Standard running in Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM), two members of the
   SHA-2 family of hashes (SHA-256 and SHA-384), and X.509
   certificates.

1. Suite B and Secure Shell

   Several RFCs have been drafted that document how each of the Suite B
   components are to be integrated into Secure Shell:
 
     kex algorithms
           ecdh-sha2-nistp256           [SSH-ECC]
           ecdh-sha2-nistp384           [SSH-ECC]
     server host key algorithms
           x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256   [SSH-X509]
           x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384   [SSH-X509]
     encryption algorithms (both client_to_server and server_to_client)
           AEAD_AES_128_GCM             [SSH-GCM]
           AEAD_AES_256_GCM             [SSH-GCM]
     mac algorithms (both client_to_server and server_to_client)
           AEAD_AES_128_GCM             [SSH-GCM]
           AEAD_AES_256_GCM             [SSH-GCM]
     
     
   Suite B Certificates and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile
   ([RFC5759]) is the authoritative source on the requirements for Suite
   B X.509v3 certificates. 
 
   The purpose of this document is to draw upon all of these documents
   to provide guidance for Suite B compliant implementations of secure
   shell (hereafter referred to as SecSh-B).  Note that while SecSh-B
   MUST follow the guidance in this document, that does not in and of
   itself imply a given implementation of secure shell is suitable for
   use in protecting classified data.  An implementation of SecSh-B must
   be validated by the appropriate authority before such usage is
   permitted. 
 
   The two elliptic curves used in Suite B appear in the literature
   under two different names.  For sake of clarity we list both names
   below. 
 
    Curve        NIST name        SECG name      OID [SEC2]
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    P-256        nistp256         secp256r1     1.2.840.10045.3.1.7
    P-384        nistp384         secp384r1     1.3.132.0.34
   
   A description of these curves can be found in [NIST] or [SEC2]. 
 
   For sake of brevity, ECDSA-256 will be used to denote ECDSA on P-256
   using SHA-256, and ECDSA-384 will be used to denote ECDSA on P-384
   using SHA-384. 
 

1.1. Minimum Levels of Security (minLOS)

   Suite B provides for two levels of cryptographic security, namely a

Internet Draft          draft-igoe-secsh-suiteb-04          Jan 19, 2011


   128-bit minimum level of security (minLOS_128) and a 192-bit minimum
   level of security (minLOS_192).  As we shall see below, the
   ECDSA-256/384 signature algorithms and corresponding X.509v3
   certificates are treated somewhat differently than the non-signature
   primitives (kex algorithms, encryption algorithms and mac algorithms
   in secure shell parlance). 
 

1.2. Digital Signatures and Certificates

   SecSh-B uses ECDSA-256/384 for server authentication, user
   authentication, and in X.509 certificates.  [SSH-X509] defines two
   methods, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 and x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,
   that are to be used for server and user authentication.  The
   following conditions must be met:
 
      1) The server MUST share its public key with the host using an
         X.509v3 certificate as described on [SSH-X509].  This public
         key MUST be used to authenticate the server to the host using
         ECDSA-256 or ECDSA-384 as appropriate (see section 3). 
 
      2) User authentication MUST begin with public key authentication
         using ECDSA-256/384 with X.509v3 certificates (see section 4). 
         Additional user authentication methods MAY be used, but only
         after the certificate based ECDSA authentication has been
         successfully completed. 
 
      3) The X.509v3 certificates MUST use only the two Suite B digital
         signatures, ECDSA-256 and ECDSA-384. 
 
      4) ECDSA-256 MUST NOT be used to sign an ECDSA-384 public key. 
 
      5) ECDSA-384 MAY be used to sign an ECDSA-256 public key. 
 
      6) At minLOS_192, all SecSh-B implementations MUST be able to
         verify ECDSA-384 signatures. 
 
      7) At minLOS_128, all SecSh-B implementations MUST be able to
         verify ECDSA-256 signatures and SHOULD be able to verify
         ECDSA-384 signatures unless it is absolutely certain that the
         implementation will never need to verify certificates
         originating from an authority which uses an ECDSA-384 signing
         key. 
 
      8) At minLOS_128, each SecSh-B server and each SecSh-B user MUST
         have either an ECDSA-256 signing key with corresponding X.509V3
         certificate, an ECDSA-384 signing key with corresponding
         X.509v3 certificate, or both. 
 
      9) At minLOS_192-bit each SecSh-B server and each SecSh-B user
         MUST have an ECDSA-384 signing key with corresponding X.509v3
         certificate.

   The selection of signature algorithm to be used for server
   authentication is governed by the server_host_key_algorithms
   name-list in the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT packet (see section 2.1).  The key
   exchange and server authentication are performed by the
   SSH_MSG_KEXECDH_REPLY packets (see section 3).  User authentication
   is done via the SSH_USER_AUTH_REQUEST messages (see section 4). 
 

1.3. Non-Signature Primitives

   This section covers the constraints the choice of minimum security
   level imposes upon the selection of key agreement protocol (kex
   algorithm), encryption algorithm, and data integrity algorithm (mac
   algorithm).  We divide the non-signature algorithms into two families
   as shown in table 1. 
 
       +--------------+----------------------+----------------------+
       |  Algorithm   |  Family 1            |  Family 2            |
       +==============+======================+======================+
       |  kex         |  ecdh-sha2-nistp256  |  ecdh-sha2-nistp384  |
       +--------------+----------------------+----------------------+
       |  encryption  |  AEAD_AES_128_GCM    |  AEAD_AES_256_GCM    |
       +--------------+----------------------+----------------------+
       |  mac         |  AEAD_AES_128_GCM    |  AEAD_AES_256_GCM    |
       +--------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
       
               Table 1: Families of Non-signature Algorithms
                         is Suite B Complaint Secure Shell
       
       
   At the 128-bit minimum level of security:
 
      - the non-signature algorithms MUST either come exclusively from
        Family 1 or exclusively from Family 2. 
 
      - the selection of Family 1 versus Family 2 is independent of the
        choice of server host key algorithm. 
 
   At the 192-bit minimum level of security:
 
     - the non-signature algorithms MUST all come from Family 2. 
 
   Most of the constraints described in this section can be achieved by
   severely restricting the kex_algorithms, encryption_algorithms, and
   mac_algorithms name lists offered in the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT packet.  See
   section 2.1 for details. 
 

2. Security Mechanism Negotiation and Initialization

   As described in [SSH-Tran], the exchange of SSH_MSG_KEXINIT between

   the server and the client establishes which key agreement algorithm,
   mac algorithms, host key algorithm (server authentication algorithm),
   and encryption algorithms are to be used.  This section describes how
   the Suite B components are to be used in the secure shell algorithm
   negotiation, key agreement, server authentication and user
   authentication. 
 
   Negotiation and initialization of a Suite B secure shell connection
   involves the following secure shell messages (where C->S denotes a
   message from the client to the server and S->C denotes a server to
   client message):
 
      
      SSH_MSG_KEXINIT           C->S  Contains lists of algorithms
                                      acceptable to the client.
      
      SSH_MSG_KEXINIT           S->C  Contains lists of algorithms
                                      acceptable to the server.
      
      SSH_MSG_KEXECDH_INIT      C->S  Contains the client's ephemeral
                                      elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key.
      
      SSH_MSG_KEXECDH_REPLY     S->C  Contains a certificate with the
                                      server's ECDSA public signature
                                      key, the server's ephemeral ECDH
                                      contribution, and an ECDSA digital
                                      signature of the newly formed
                                      exchange hash value.
      
      SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST  C->S  Contains the user's name, the
                                      name of the service the user is
                                      requesting, the name of the
                                      authentication method the client
                                      wishes to use, and method specific
                                      fields.
      
      
   When not in the midst of processing a key exchange, either party may
   initiate a key re-exchange by sending an SSH_MSG_KEXINIT packet.  All
   packets exchanged during the re-exchange are encrypted and
   authenticated using the current keys until the conclusion of the
   re-exchange, at which point a SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS initiates a change to
   the newly established keys.  Otherwise the re-exchange protocol is
   identical to the initial key exchange protocol.  See section 9 of
   [SSH-Tran]. 
 

2.1. Algorithm negotiation: SSH_MSG_KEXINIT

   The choice of all but the user authentication methods are determined
   by the exchange of SSH_MSG_KEXINIT between the client and the
   server.  As described in [SSH-Tran], the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT packet has

   the following structure:
 
      
      byte         SSH_MSG_KEXINIT
      byte[16]     cookie (random bytes)

   The SSH_MSG_KEXINIT namelists can be used to constrain the choice of
   non-signature and host key algorithms in accordance with the guidance
   given in section 1.  Table 2 lists three allowable namelists for the
   non-signature algorithms.  One of these options MUST be used.

        encryption_algorithm name_list  := { AEAD_AES_256_GCM   }
        mac_algorithm name_list         := { AEAD_AES_256_GCM   }

        Table 3: Allowed Server Host Key Algorithm Namelists
     

3. Key Exchange and Server Authentication

   SecSh-B uses ECDH to establish a shared secret value between the
   client and the server.  An X.509v3 certificate containing the
   server's public signing ECDSA key and an ECDSA signature on the
   exchange hash value derived from the newly established shared secret
   value are used to authenticate the server to the client. 
 

3.1. SSH_MSG_KEXECDH_INIT

   The key exchange to be used is Secure Shell is determined by the
   namelists exchanged in the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT packets.  In Suite B, one
   of the following key agreement methods MUST be used to generate a
   shared secret value (SSV):
 
      ecdh-sha2-nistp256      ephemeral-ephemeral elliptic curve
                              Diffie-Hellman on nistp256 with SHA-256
      ecdh-sha2-nistp384      ephemeral-ephemeral elliptic curve
                              Diffie-Hellman on nistp384 with SHA-384
      
   and the format of the SSH_MSG_KEXECDH_INIT message is:
 
      byte      SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT
      string    Q_C    // client's ephemeral contribution to the ECDH
                       // exchange, encoded as an octet string
      
   where the encoding of the elliptic curve point Q_C as an octet string
   is as specified in section 2.3.3 of [SEC1]. 
 

3.2. SSH_MSG_KEXECDH_REPLY

   The SSH_MSG_KEXECDH_REPLY contains the server's contribution to the
   ECDH exchange, the server's public signature key, and a signature of

   the exchange hash value formed from the newly established shared
   secret value.  As stated is secion 2.1, in SecSh-B, the server host
   key algorithm MUST be either x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 or
   x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384. 
 
   The format of the SSH_MSG_KEXECDH_REPLY is:
 
      byte      SSH_MSG_KEXECDH_REPLY
      string    K_S    // A string encoding an X.509v3 certificate
                       // containing the server's ECDSA public host key
      string    Q_S    // server's ephemeral contribution to the ECDH
                       // exchange, encoded as an octet string
      string    Sig_S  // an octet string containing the server's
                       // signature of the newly established exchange
                       // hash value
      
   Details on the structure and encoding of the X.509v3certificate can
   be found in section 2 of [SSH-X509].  The encoding of the elliptic
   curve point Q_C as an octet string is as specified in section 2.3.3
   of [SEC1] and the encoding of the ECDSA signature Sig_S as an octet
   string is as described in section 3.1.2 of [SSH-ECC]. 
 

3.3. Key and Initialization Vector Derivation

   As specified in [SSH-Tran], the encryption keys and initialization
   vectors needed by secure shell are derived directly from the SSV
   using the hash function specified by the key agreement algorithm
   (SHA-256 for ecdh-sha2-nistp256 and SHA-384 for ecdh-sha2-nistp384). 
   The client to server channel and the server to client channel will
   have independent keys and initialization vectors.  These keys will
   remain constant until a re-exchange results in the formation of a new
   SSV. 
 

4. User Authentication

   The Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol authenticates the server to
   the host but does not authenticate the user (or the user's host) to
   the server.  For this reason, condition (2) of section 1.2 requires
   that all users of SecSh-B MUST be authenticated using ECDSA-256/384
   signatures and X.509v3 certificates.  [SSH-X509] provides two
   methods, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 and x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,
   that MUST be used to achieve this goal.  At minLOS 128, either one of
   these methods may be used, but at minLOS 192
   x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 MUST be used. 
 

4.1. First SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST Message

   The user's public key is sent to the server using an
   SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message.  When an x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-* user

Internet Draft          draft-igoe-secsh-suiteb-04          Jan 19, 2011


   authentication method is being used, the structure of the
   SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message should be:
 
      byte      SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
      string    user_name      // in ISO-10646 UTF-8 encoding
      string    service_name   // service name in US-ASCII
      string    "publickey"
      boolean   FALSE
      string    public_key_algorithm_name  // x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256
                                        // or x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384
      string    public_key_blob // X509.v3 certificate
      
   Details on the structure and encoding of the X.509v3 certificate can
   be found in section 2 of [SSH-X509]. 
 

4.2. Second SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST Message

   Once the server has responded to the request message with an
   SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK message, the client uses a second
   SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message to perform the actual
   authentication:
 
      byte      SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
      string    user_name      // in ISO-10646 UTF-8 encoding
      string    service_name   // service name in US-ASCII
      string    "publickey"
      boolean   TRUE
      string    public_key_algorithm_name  // x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256
                                        // or x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384
      
      string    Sig_U
      
   The signature field Sig_U is an ECDSA signature of the concatenation
   of several values, including the session identifier, user name,
   service name, public key algorithm name, and the user's public
   signing key.  The user's public signing key MUST be the signing key
   conveyed in the X.509v3 certificate sent in the first
   SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message.  The encoding of the ECDSA
   signature Sig_U as an octet string is as described in section 3.1.2
   of [SSH-ECC]. 
 
   The server MUST respond with either SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS (if no
   more authentications are needed), or SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE (if the
   request failed, or more authentications are needed). 
 

5. Confidentiality and Data Integrity of SSH Binary Packets

   Secure shell transfers data between the client and the server using
   its own binary packet structure.  The SSH binary packet structure is
   independent of any packet structure on the underlying data channel. 


Igoe                       Informational                       [Page 10]

Internet Draft          draft-igoe-secsh-suiteb-04          Jan 19, 2011


   The contents of each binary packet and portions of the header are
   encrypted and each packet is authenticated with its own message
   authentication code.  AES GCM will both encrypt the packet and form a
   16-octet authentication tag to ensure data integrity. 
 

5.1. Galois/Counter Mode

   [SSH-GCM] describes how AES Galois Counter Mode is to be used in
   secure shell.  Suite B SSH implementations MUST use support
   AEAD_AES_GCM_128 and SHOULD support AEAD_AES_GCM_256 to provide both
   confidentiality and ensure data integrity.  No other confidentiality
   or data integrity algorithms are permitted. 
 
   These algorithms rely on two counters:
 
      Invocation Counter: A 64-bit integer, incremented after each call
      to AES-GCM to process an SSH binary packet.  The initial value of
      the invocation counter is determined by the SSH initialization
      vector. 
 
      Block Counter: A 32-bit integer, set to one at the start of each
      new SSH binary packet and incremented as each 16-octet block of
      data is processed. 
 
   Ensuring that these counters are properly implemented is crucial to
   the security of the system.  The reader is referred to [SSH-GCM] for
   details on the format, initialization and usage of these counters and
   their relationship to the initialization vector and the SSV. 
 

5.2. Data Integrity

   The reader is reminded that, as specified in [SSH-GCM], Suite B
   requires that all 16-octets of the authentication tag MUST be used as
   the SSH data integrity value of the SSH binary packet. 
 

6. Rekeying

   Secure Shell allows either the server or client to request that the
   secure shell connection be rekeyed.  Suite B places no constraints on
   how frequently this is to be done, but it does require that the
   cipher suite being employed MUST NOT be changed when a rekey occurs. 
 

7. Security Considerations

   When using ecdh_sha2_nistp256, each exponent used in the key exchange
   must have 256 bits of entropy.  Similarly, when using
   ecdh_sha2_nistp384, each exponent used in the key exchange must have
   384 bits of entropy.  The security considerations of [SSH-Arch]

1.  Introduction

   The Geopriv civic location specification [RFC5139] defines an XML
   schema that are intended to allow the expression of civic location in
   most countries.  It was recognized that some countries may require a
   profile or guidance on how to specify local addresses using the
   elements defined in [RFC5139] and so [RFC5774] was produced to
   provide this function.  Subsequent to these specifications being
   produced, a number of individual contributions have been made trying
   to add additional civic elements to address local jurisdictional
   requirements.  These contributions were specified in such a away that
   broke backward compatibility for protocols, equipment, and other
   standards already using the [RFC5139] specification.

   This document defines a method that allows the specification of local
   civic address elements inside a [RFC5139] object.  It further allows
   these local civic elements to be carried over DHCP using [RFC4776],
   HELD [RFC5985], and LoST [RFC5222] without modification and so
   maintain backward compatibility with existing specifications and
   implementations.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Specifying Local Civic Elements

   The civic schema in [RFC5139] defines an ordered structure of
   elements that can be combined to describe a street address.  The XML
   extension point at the bottom of the schema is used to include
   address elements of local significance into the main civic body.

   For example, suppose the Central Devon Canals authority wishes to
   introduce a new civic element called "bridge".  The authority must
   define an XML namespace and define the "bridge" element within that
   namespace.  The namespace needs to be a URI and needs to be unique,
   for example "http://www.central.devon.canals.org/ns1.0".  Finally,
   the authority can create a civic address that includes the new
   "bridge" element at the bottom.

   Nodes that receive the location information but don't understand the
   locally specified address elements can safely ignore them, yet still
   interpret the main civic elements from [RFC5139] and so maintain
   backward compatibility.  Where the information is passed to local
   applications, such as a LoST server for emergency call routing, the
   significance of the localized elements can be safely applied.  This
   allows localized address elements to be included in a location
   response from a LIS using HELD without modification being required to
   the HELD protocol or the HELD client on the device.

3.1.  Localized Elements Using DHCP

   In networks that elect to use DHCP to provide civic address
   information to clients, two new CATypes are defined to address this
   basic functionality, and no further CATypes will be allocated by
   IANA.

   The "Namespace" CAType provides the definition of an XML namespace
   and a corresponding namespace prefix.  This CAType is sent multiple
   times if elements from multiple namespaces are required.

   The "Element" CAType conveys a single namespace element and its
   value.  The element name is qualified with a namespace prefix that is
   provided using a Namespace CAType.  If no corresponding Namespace
   CAType is received that defines the namespace prefix in an Element
   CAType, then the Element CAType MUST be ignored.

   To aid in client parsing and reduce the likelihood of server
   configuration errors, it is RECOMMENDED that all Namespace CATypes
   proceed any Element CATypes in the response from the server to the
   client.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a formal way to extend the existing Geopriv
   civic schema.  No security threats are introduced by this document.
   Security threats applicable to configuring a device with a civic
   address using DHCP are specified in [RFC4776].  Security threats
   applicable to providing a device with its civic location using HELD
   are specific in [RFC5985]


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the civic address type registry established by
   [RFC4776].  Three additional value are added:

   XX "Namespace":  Namespace in which the local address elements are
      defined

   YY  "Element":  qualified local address element and value value

   Further this document terminates the addition of CATypes that
   proposed future specification may attempt to define.  Required civic
   elements not defined in the [RFC5139] MUST only be provided using the
   mechanism described in this document.

   [[IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace XX and YY with the allocated civic
   address type number assigned from the pool]]


6.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Brian Rosen, Delaine Arnold, Robins George, and anyone else
   who has tried to extend the civic schema and found it a little
   unintuative

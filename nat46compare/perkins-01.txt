    Comparison and integration of IVI, IVI+DHCP, 1:N IVI and SIPNAT
                   draft-nat46compare-perkins-01.txt

Abstract

   IVI, IVI + DHCPv6, 1:N IVI, Bidirectional NAT, and SIPNAT have been
   proposed to global Internet access to IPv6-only domains.  These
   methods are not all mutually exclusive, and we propose that IVI
   (along with its variants) along with SIPNAT may be considered
   together as a more complete solution for enabling access from today's
   IPv4 global Internet into IPv6-only domains.  This would likely have
   the effect of accelerating the adoption of IPv6, since with such
   access enablements there would be much reduced incentive for new
   deployments to require IPv4 addressability.  As part of the
   discussion, we also include a comparison of the various techniques so
   the relative trade-offs may be more easily understood.

Internet-Draft          IVI + SIPNAT Integration              March 2010


1.  Introduction

   IVI [2], 1:N IVI [4], and SIPNAT [1] have been proposed to enable
   communications to be initiated from today's IPv4-based Internet and
   successfully terminated at IPv6-only devices.  This is important so
   that IPv6-only devices will be fully functional and reachable in
   today's IPv4 Internet.

   In particular, it is not enough to only support outgoing connections
   (i.e., connections initiated by the IPv6 network device not directly
   reachable from today's IPv4 Internet).  For many purposes, it is
   required to support incoming connections.  Businesses need to serve
   communications from their clients, which almost always seem to
   emanate from the global IPv4 Internet.  This means that such
   communications have to be admissible even when the target computer
   (in the internal domain) has not triggered the setup operations at
   the border router which are typically required for operations such as
   NAT to work.  Such communications, which are initiated from sites
   external to the site hosting the IPv6-only destination are classified
   as belonging to "Scenario 2" or "Scenario 4" [3]

   With traditional port-mapped NAT (NAPT), this has not been possible
   because, for each source-destination flow, the translation parameters
   for the flow have had to be established by the internal network node
   (i.e., the node with the IP address that is incompatible with the
   addressing domain of the global Internet).  In particular, for each
   such flow there needs to be an external IP address and an external
   port assigned.  Packets arriving at the external IP address and port
   are then translated and retransmitted with new IP headers containing
   the translated IP address and port number.  This works for
   IPv6-->IPv4 translation, IPv4-->IPv4 translation (e.g., today's
   Internet), and other variations as well.  It is a workable solution
   (with various second-order difficulties) for enabling outgoing
   traffic to be delivered into the global Internet.

   But any business requires global presence and continuous, on-demand
   availability.  The customers have to be able to initiate contact with
   the business services, not the other way around.  Similarly for all
   other online service organizations (including governmental, non-
   profit, and family websites).

2.  Proposals for supporting Scenario 2 and Scenario 4 communications

   To enable such incoming translations IVI [2] (along with several
   variations for improved scalability) and "source-IP NAT" (SIPNAT)[1]
   have been proposed.  It is not the purpose of this document to
   reiterate the individual designs.  Instead, we exhibit the
   characteristics of each proposal in such a way that it is easier to
   identify the best translation technique according to the needs of the
   specific IPv6-only destinations.  For some destinations that
   experience persistent high-volume traffic, IVI is best.  For some
   destinations that support significant traffic which is variable from
   time to time, IVI+DHCP is best.  For destinations that host certain
   appropriate applications, 1:N IVI may be best.  For some other
   destinations hosting relatively lower-volume websites, SIPNAT may be
   best.

   IVI

      IVI [2] statically reserves an IPv4 address on the translator for
      each IPv6 destination which is to be made reachable to the global
      IPv4 Internet.  This is done via a one-to-one mapping algorithm
      between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  The IPv4 address can only be
      used by the single IPv6 destination.

   IVI + DHCP

      (IVI + DHCP) uses DHCP to dynamically reserve an IPv4 address on
      the translator, and as part of the reservation process updates the
      DNS so that the allocated address is returned for the IPv6
      destination to be made reachable.  At any one time, the IPv4
      address can only be used by the single IPv6 destination, but the
      IPv4 address can be reused for another IPv6 destination depending
      on the DHCP lifetime allocation policies.

   1:N IVI

      1:N IVI [4] statically reserves an IPv4 address and a port range
      (either high or low) on the translator for each IPv6 destination
      which is to be made reachable to the global IPv4 Internet.  For
      example, this could be done by preconfiguration The IPv4 address
      and port range and can only be used by the single IPv6
      destination.  DHCP could be extended for this purpose to also
      return the port range when the IPv4 reservation is made.  This
      would allow temporal sharing for the address and port range.

Internet-Draft          IVI + SIPNAT Integration              March 2010


   SIPNAT

      SIPNAT ("Source-IP NAT") dynamically associates an IPv4 address on
      the translator, on demand, when a communication is initiated from
      the global IPv4 Internet.  The FQDN of the destination IPv6 does
      not typically have a persistent resolution for any particular IPv4
      address.  A single IPv4 address of the translator can be
      simultaneously used for flows to many different IPv6 destinations.
      The source IPv4 address of incoming packets is used to identify
      the desired IPv6 destination.  For any such source IPv4 address,
      only one destination is reachable at the translator's IPv4
      interface address which as been associated with the IPv6
      destination.  Ports are not required for the translation, but
      should be considered as part of of the set of flow translation
      parameters.

   The authors believe that all of these approaches have interesting use
   cases and should be coordinated into an overall solution.

   o  IVI is a good solution for destinations that serve many flows, and
      are each typically active serving one or more flows from the IPv4
      Internet.  In this case, there is little or no advantage to be
      gained by dynamic assignment.

   o  IVI + DHCP is a good solution for destinations that may be
      inactive for extended periods of time, but are also likely to
      serve many flows during other extended periods of time.

   o  1:N IVI is a good solution which may be workable for situations
      where destinations host applications that are resilient and aware
      of port restrictions.

   o  SIPNAT is a good solution for situations where there are a large
      number of IPv6 destinations, each of which serves a relatively low
      volume of flows (e.g, fewer than 100 distinct flows per hour).

3.  Work to be done

   The usefulness of this integrated solution set depends upon
   establishing policies for partitioning the available IPv4 addresses
   of the translator according to persistence of IPv4 address and the
   persistence of the FQDN resolution.  For sites requiring full
   persistence, IVI should be used.  Sites serving a continual stream of
   new flow requests fit within this classification.  For sites
   requiring persistence of association between FQDN and IPv4 address,
   (IVI + DHCP) should be used.  Sites which sometimes serve a high
   volume of flow requests, but at other times are quiescent, fit this
   second classification.  Sites which serve flows less frequently
   (e.g., approximately 1 per minute or so) can be served by SIPNAT.

   The exact percentages and flow rates for these classifications remain
   to be determined.  As experienced is acquired in the management of
   larger domains, better estimates for economical allocations of IPv4
   addresses will become feasible.  In general, the more IPv4 addresses
   that are available on the translator, the better.  But, on the other
   hand, the fewer IPv4 addresses required, the better.  Soon, the IPv4
   address space will be exhausted and it is important to improve as
   much as possible the utilization of this valuable resource.

   The partitioning of the translator's IPv4 address space is to be made
   between IVI, (IVI+DHCP), and SIPNAT.  This partitioning may be
   static, based on observed traffic characteristics.  As our
   understanding improves, we suggest that the partitioning itself
   should be made dynamic.  For instance, if a particular website grows
   in popularity so that it is constantly serving new flow requests, it
   may be advisable to remove it from SIPNAT handling by assigning a
   permanent IVI address on the NAT IPv4 interface.  Conversely, a
   particular IVI website may be partitioned into multiple destinations,
   each of which might have lower traffic volume and therefore require a
   lower persistence of addressability, potentially served well by (IVI
   + DHCP) or SIPNAT.  Many variations are likely to be found useful.

5.  Summary

   Several solutions have been proposed for the cases denoted as
   "Scenario 2" and "Scenario 4".  We have found that these solutions
   can be coordinated as described in this document, and propose that
   our solutions be considered together for standardization in
   fulfillment of the requirement.

Abstract

   This document requests IANA to recategorize several entries in the
   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Extended Communities registry from
   "Experimental Use" to non-experimental.

Internet-Draft  Recategorization of Extended Communities    October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Extended Communities registry lists
   Extended Communities 0x8000-0x8fff as Experimental Use, in keeping
   with [RFC4360].  In practice, the use of Extended Communities 0x8006-
   0x8009, defined in [RFC5575] and 0x800a, defined in [RFC4761] is not
   Experimental.  The most straightforward solution to this problem is
   to recategorize those code points as Standards Action.


2.  Discussion

   The other solution to this issue would be to update the relevant
   specifications to use code points from the currently defined
   Standards Action space.  Given that there is deployment of the
   currently-allocated code points, there would be non-negligible
   development, testing and operational expense to migrate to new code
   points, without any significant benefit being derived.  Given that
   there is no evident disadvantage to simply recategorizing the current
   code points, that solution is to be preferred.


3.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Andy Malis for his contribution.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA recategorize Extended Communities 0x8006-
   0x800a as Standards Action.  It is noted that the relevant
   specifications are already Standards Track RFCs.


5.  Security Considerations

   No security considerations arise from this document.

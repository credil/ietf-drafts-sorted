   Encryption of Header Extensions in the Secure  Real-Time Transport
                            Protocol (SRTP)
          draft-lennox-avt-srtp-encrypted-extension-headers-01

Abstract

   The Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides
   authentication, but not encryption, of the headers of Real-Time
   Transport Protocol (RTP) packets.  However, RTP header extensions may
   carry sensitive information for which participants in multimedia
   sessions want confidentiality.  This document provides a mechanism,
   extending the mechanisms of SRTP, to selectively encrypt RTP header
   extensions in SRTP.

Internet-Draft      Encrypted SRTP Header Extensions          March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol [RFC3711] specification
   provides confidentiality, message authentication, and replay
   protection for multimedia payloads sent using of the Real-Time
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].  However, in order to preserve RTP header
   compression efficiency, SRTP provides only authentication and replay
   protection for the headers of RTP packets, not confidentiality.

   For the standard portions of an RTP header, this does not normally
   present a problem, as the information carried in an RTP header does
   not provide much information beyond that which an attacker could
   infer by observing the size and timing of RTP packets.  Thus, there
   is little need for confidentiality of the header information.

   However, this is not necessarily true for information carried in RTP
   header extensions.  A number of recent proposals for header
   extensions using the General Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions
   [RFC5285] carry information for which confidentiality could be
   desired or essential.  Notably, two recent drafts
   ([I-D.lennox-avt-rtp-audio-level-exthdr] and [I-D.ivov-avt-slic])
   carry information about per-packet sound levels of the media data
   carried in the RTP payload, and exposing this to an eavesdropper may
   be unacceptable in many circumstances.

   This document, therefore, defines a mechanism by which encryption can
   be applied to RTP header extensions when they are transported using
   SRTP.  As an RTP sender may wish some extension information to be
   sent in the clear (for example, it may be useful for a network
   monitoring device to be aware of RTP transmission time offsets
   [RFC5450]), this mechanism can be selectively applied to a subset of
   the header extension elements carried in an SRTP packet.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Encryption Mechanism

   Encrypted header extension elements are carried in the same manner as
   non-encrypted header extension elements, as defined by [RFC5285].
   The (one- or two-byte) header of the extension elements is not
   encrypted, nor is any of the header extension padding.  If multiple

Internet-Draft      Encrypted SRTP Header Extensions          March 2010


   different header extension elements are being encrypted, they have
   separate element identifier values, just as they would if they were
   not encrypted; similarly, encrypted and non-encrypted header
   extension elements have separate identifier values.

   To encrypt (or decrypt) an encrypted extension header, an SRTP
   participant first generates a keystream for the SRTP extension
   header.  This keystream is generated in the same manner as the
   encryption keystream for the corersponding SRTP payload, except the
   the SRTP encryption and salting keys k_e and k_s are replaced by the
   keys k_he and k_hs, respectively.  The keys k_he and k_hs are
   computed in the same manner as k_e and k_s, except that the <label>
   values used are 0x06 for k_he and and 0x07 for k_hs.  (Note that
   since RTP headers, including extension headers, are authenticated in
   SRTP, no new authentication key is needed for extension headers.

   The SRTP participant then computes an encryption mask for the header
   extension, identifying the portions of the header extension that are,
   or are to be, encrypted.  This encryption mask corresponds to the
   entire payload of each header extension element that is encrypted.
   It does not include any non-encrypted header extension elements, any
   extension element headers, or any padding octets.  The encryption
   mask has all-bits-1 octets (i.e., hexidecimal 0xff) for octets which
   are to be encrypted, and all-bits-0 for octets which are not to be.

   For those octets indicated in the encryption mask, the SRTP
   participant bitwise exclusive-ors the header extension with the
   keystream to produce the ciphertext version of the header extension.
   Those octets not indicated in the encryption mask are left
   unmodified.  Thus, conceptually, the encryption mask is logically
   ANDed with the keystream to produce a masked keystream.  The sender
   and receiver MUST use the same encryption mask.  The set of extension
   elements to be encrypted is communicated between the sender and the
   receiver using the signaling mechanisms described in Section 4.

   The SRTP authentication tag is computed across the encrypted header
   extension, i.e., the data that is actually transmitted on the wire.
   Thus, header extension encryption MUST be done before the
   authentication tag is computed, and authentication tag validation
   MUST be done on the encrypted header extensions.  For receivers,
   header extension decryption SHOULD be done only after the receiver
   has validated the packet's message authentication tag.

3.1.  Example Encryption Mask

   If a sender wished to send a header extension containing an encrypted
   SMPTE timecode [RFC5484] with ID 1, a plaintext transmission time
   offset [RFC5450] with ID 2, and an audio level indication

   [I-D.lennox-avt-rtp-audio-level-exthdr] with ID 3, the plaintext RTP
   header extension might look like this:

    0                   1                   2                   3

Internet-Draft      Encrypted SRTP Header Extensions          March 2010


4.  Signaling (Setup) Information

   Encrypted header extension elements are signaled in the SDP extmap
   attribute, using the URI "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:encrypt",
   followed by the URI of the header extension element being encrypted
   as well as any extensionattributes that extension normally takes.
   Thus, for example, to signal an SRTP session using encrypted SMPTE
   timecodes [RFC5484], while simultaneously signaling plaintext
   transmission time offsets [RFC5450], an SDP document could contain
   (linebreaks added for formatting):

   m=audio 49170 RTP/SAVP 0
   a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_32 \
     inline:NzB4d1BINUAvLEw6UzF3WSJ+PSdFcGdUJShpX1Zj|2^20|1:32
   a=extmap:1 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:encrypt \
       urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:smpte-tc 25@600/24
   a=extmap:2 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:toffset


                                 Figure 3

   This example uses SDP Security Descriptions [RFC4568] for SRTP
   keying, but this is merely for illustration; any SRTP keying
   mechanism to establish session keys will work.


5.  Security Considerations

   The security properties of header extension elements protected by the
   mechanism in this document are equivalent to those for SRTP payloads.

   The mechanism defined in this document does not provide
   confidentiality about which header extension elements are used for a
   given SRTP packet, only for the content of those header extension
   elements.  This appears to be in the spirit of SRTP itself, which
   does not encrypt RTP headers.  If this is a concern, an alternate
   mechanism would be needed to provide confidentiality.

   This document does not specify the circumstances in which extension
   header encryption should be used.  Documents defining specific
   extension header elements should provide guidance on when encryption
   is appropriate for these elements.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new extension URI to the RTP Compact Header
   Extensions subregistry of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension of Access Node Control Protocol
   to enforce security policy for network anti-attacking.  An access
   router or NAS uses the proposed mechanism to send security policy to
   a layer 2 device which an attacking host may directly connects to.
   The solution proposed here can be used in either public access
   networks or enterprise networks.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework] defines a framework and requirements for an
   Access Node control mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS)
   and an Access Node (e.g. a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer
   (DSLAM)) in a multi-service reference architecture in order to
   perform QoS-related, service-related and subscriber-related
   operations.  It also indicates that the dedicated security
   considerations are included in [I-D.ietf-ancp-security-threats].
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] specifies a protocol for Access Node Control
   in broadband networks in line with the framework.

   The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] supports a number of use cases defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-framework] such as the Access Topology Discovery use
   case, the Access Loop Configuration use case and the Remote
   Connectivity Test use case.  However, it does not support the use
   cases for the security threats which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-security-threats].  The present document specifies the
   extensions to the Access Node Control Protocol required for support
   of network anti-attack use case.

3.  Use Case

3.1.  Goals

   [I-D.ietf-ancp-security-threats] describes the security threats which
   might be launched by the subscribers, for example, DoS attacks (SYN
   flood, fraggle, smurf, etc.).  In reality, there are other potential
   threats, such as scanning and snooping (address scanning, port
   scanning, tracert, etc.), malformed packet attacking (ping of death,
   teardrop, etc.), protocol control message attacking (PPP/DHCP
   Protocol Control Message attacking, etc.).  These attacking actions
   could be detected on the NAS site with or without the help of
   external device.  An appropriate solution is, the NAS sends an ANCP
   message which includes the corredponding network anti-attack policy
   to the AN when it detects the attack launched by the subscriber.

3.2.  Case1: Control Message Anti-attack

   Sometimes, the attackers use massive amount of control messages to
   lunch the attacks towards the NAS, such as PPP/DHCP discover message.
   The control message could be a fake message, or just replicated from
   the original one.

   Usually, the NAS will send the attacking message to its internal
   control plane first.  There will be a traffic management mechanism in
   the control plane that could be ware of the attacking event.  The TM
   procedure will be carried out before the CPU processing the control
   messages.  Since the TM usually just implements rate limitation to
   all the control messages of the same type, the legal messages will be
   discarded during the procedure.  The discarding of legal control
   messages could be prevented by dynamic ACL generating and
   implementing on the NAS site, but there will be a large number of
   ACLs at the same time.

   When the attacking event is detected, the NAS could find out the
   attackers location by the information of the attacking message, such
   as option 82 which is attached by the Access Node.  Then the NAS
   could use ANCP to send an anti-attack policy to the Access Node.  It
   could be a MAC black list including the source MAC address/addresses
   of the attacking messages, a MAC white list includes the valid MAC
   addresses that belongs to the registered subscriber, or even a rate
   limitation of the access circuit.

3.3.  Case2: Dos Anti-attack

   TCP semi-connection is a kind of SYN flood attacking tool, especially
   towards the application server.  Currently, it was detected by an
   internal/external DPI function on the NAS site.  Then the NAS will

Internet-Draft        Network Anti-Attack for ANCP             July 2010


   implement the anti-attack policy on itself.  It is a centralized
   processing method which brings a heavy burden to the NAS, since
   there!_re always a lot of DOS attacks happening in the network.

   The NAS could use the ANCP to mitigate the processing stress of the
   massively concurrent SYN flood attacks.  When the NAS detects the SYN
   flood attacking event and figure out the related access circuit by
   the attacking message, it could ask the Access Node to participating
   in the anti-attack procedure.  It means that some of the anti-attack
   policy could be implemented on the Access Node, such as MAC black
   list and rate limitation.  The layer 3 and upper layer policies will
   still be implemented on the NAS site.

   For scanning/snooping and malformed packet attacking, the ANCP
   solution is similar.

   In one word, for all the attacking methods that could be detected on
   the NAS site, whether by the control plane traffic management or by
   the internal/external DPI function, we could use ANCP to implement a
   better anti-attack solution.

3.4.  Anti-attack Policies Application Case

   The anti-attack policy could be MAC black/white list, MAC rate
   limitation, MAC table size limitation and all other functions that
   are also currently available on the Access Node.  We could use ANCP
   to dynamically enable these functions on the Access Node instead of
   statically configured by NMS/EMS.  Some application cases will be
   listed in this section.

3.4.1.  MAC Black List Application

   For discarding the attacks packets of a dedicated MAC address (e.g.
   SYN flood attacks and control message attacks towards the NAS), we
   could implement MAC black list on the Access Node through ANCP from
   the NAS.

3.4.2.  MAC White List Application

   The NAS could send all the registered MAC addresses to the
   corresponding AN to enable the MAC white list function.  So that the
   attacking messages with unregistered MAC will be discarding on the
   NAS site.

3.4.3.  MAC Table Size Limitation Application

   A MAC table size limitation amount on the AN could efficiently reduce
   the attacking packets which use the fake MAC addresses.  This

Internet-Draft        Network Anti-Attack for ANCP             July 2010


   function could be implemented on the enterprise use access line by
   ANCP.

3.4.4.  MAC Rate Limitation Application

   A rate limitation function on the access line for a dedicated MAC
   address, but not for the whole access line, could limit the upstream
   flow of the MAC address, and not influence the others.

3.5.  Message Flow

   In this use case, a Policy Configuration Message is sent by the NAS
   to the AN with or without a timer which indicates the enforcement
   duration.  The AN uses a Configuration Response Message as a feedback
   to the NAS, includes success or failure as the running result.  The
   NAS sends a Policy Release Message to stop the policy enforcement if
   there was no timer within the Policy Configuration Message.  The AN
   will send a Release Response Message to the NAS when it receives the
   Policy Release Message or policy times out according to the timer.
   Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate the ANCP message exchange as well as
   the associated AN behavior.

4.  ANCP Messages

   This section defines new ANCP messages as well as procedures
   associated with the use of these messages.

4.1.  Policy Configuration Message

   This section defines a message called the Policy Configuration
   Message.  The Policy Configuration Message Type 1 is sent by the NAS
   to the AN.  A Configuration Response Message will be sent from the AN
   to the NAS as a feedback.

   The Message Type for the Policy Configuration Message is 0xa0.  The
   sender of a Policy Configuration Message MUST set the Result field to
   "0x00" meaning "Ignore".  The sender MUST populate the ANCP
   Transaction Identifier field with a unique value, as described in
   section 5.4.5 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] .

4.1.1.  Policy Configuration Message Type 1

   The payload of Policy Configuration Message Type 1 contains the
   following TLVs:

   o Target TLV: The Target TLV is defined in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] .
   It MUST appear once and only once.  It is encoded as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] and identifies the AN port subject to the
   request for anti-attack policy enforcement.

   o Command TLV: The Command TLV is defined in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol]
   .  It MUST be present.  It MAY appear multiple times.  Each Command
   TLV contains one or more sub-TLVs, each of which includes an anti-
   attack policy directive for the target.

   The contents of the Command TLV for the Policy Configuration Message
   are defined in Figure 3 and subsequent text.

       Figure 3: Command TLV in Policy Configuration Message Type 1

   Command Code:

   Command directive: 0x01 - Add (here means add to MAC Black/White
   List); 0x07 - Update (here means update MAC Table Size Limitation /
   Rate Limitation); 0x09 - Shut Down the Target.

   Command Length:

   Length in bytes of the Command includes all the sub-TLVs, but
   excludes the Command Code header and flags.

   Flags:

   8 bit Flag field.  Currently the following flags are defined:

   R - Retry Flag.  The NAS will send again the Policy Configuration
   Message to the AN if it doesn!_t receive the Configuration Response
   Message from the AN.  The R flag will be set to 1 in the retry
   message.  The AN will send again the Configuration Response Message
   to the NAS when it receives the retry message.

4.1.2.  Policy Configuration Message Type 2

   Comparing with Policy Configuration Message Type 1, the only
   difference is that the Policy Configuration Message Type 2 has an
   additional Policy-Timer sub-TLV which indicates the policy
   enforcement duration, so that the NAS does not need to send a Policy
   Release Message to the AN.

4.2.  Configuration Response Message

   This section defines a message called the Configuration Response
   Message.  The Configuration Response Message is sent by the AN to the
   NAS, when the it receives a Policy Configuration Message Type 1 or
   Policy Configuration Message Type 2 Message from the NAS.

   The general purpose of the Configuration Response Message is to
   provide information on the success or failure to process a Policy
   Configuration Message received from the NAS.

   The Message Type for the Configuration Response Message is 0xa1.

   A Configuration Response Message MUST use the same ANCP Transaction
   ID as that in the message that it is responding to.  The Success or
   Failure status is reported in the Result field of the ANCP header as
   described in section 5 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] .  A Configuration

   Response Message indicating Success SHOULD simply consist only of the
   base ANCP header with no body, however the message MAY contain one or
   more TLVs that are meant to communicate any relevant information to
   an application.  The payload of a Configuration Response Message
   indicating Failure MUST contain one or more Status-Info TLVs (0x12)
   (as defined in [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] ) followed by the Target TLV.
   Other TLVs MAY be present.  A Configuration Response Message
   indicating Failure MUST be sent whenever a Policy Configuration
   Message cannot be fulfilled or results in an execution error.  The
   Cmnd Nmbr parameter in the Status-Info TLV SHOULD be set to 0x00.

   The following values are defined for the Result Code field in the
   Status-Info TLV contained in a Configuration Response Message:

   0x00 - Success

   0x01 - Malformed message

   0x02 - Command not supported

   0x08 - Unrecognized Target

   0x09 - Target down

   0x10 - Transaction-id out of sequence

   0x14 - Invalid MAC Table Size

   0x15 - Invalid Rate Limitation Amount

   0x17 - Invalid MAC Address

   An example of a failure message for an invalid address, including the
   Target TLV for a 4 byte "Access Loop Circuit ID", followed by TLV
   padding, is as follows:

       Figure 4: Example of Configuration Response Message (Failure)

   Note that the Configuration Response Message may includes one or more
   Status-info TLVs.  For example, part of the MAC addresses which are
   included in the Policy Configuration Message are invalid and
   succeeded to be add into the MAC black/white list, and the others are
   valid.  Here we could use two status-info TLVs in the Configuration
   Response Message.

4.3.  Policy Release Message

   This section defines a message called the Policy Release Message.
   The Policy Release Message is sent by the NAS to the AN.  A Rlease
   Response Message will be sent from the AN to the NAS as a feedback.

   The Message Type for the Policy Configuration Message Type 1 is 0xa2.
   The sender of a Policy Release Message MUST set the Result field to
   "0x00" meaning "Ignore".  The sender MUST populate the ANCP
   Transaction Identifier field with a unique value, as described in
   section 5.4.5 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] .

   The payload of Policy Release Message contains the following TLVs:

   This section defines a message called the Release Response Message.
   The Release Response Message is sent by the AN to the NAS, when the
   it receives a Configuration Release Message Type 1 or Policy
   Configuration Message Type 2 Message from the NAS.

   The general purpose of the Release Response Message is to provide
   information on the success or failure to process a Policy Release
   Message received from the NAS.

   The Message Type for the Release Response Message is 0xa3.

   A Release Response Message MUST use the same ANCP Transaction ID as
   that in the message that it is responding to.  The Success or Failure
   status is reported in the Result field of the ANCP header as
   described in section 5 of [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] .  A Release
   Response Message indicating Success SHOULD simply consist only of the
   base ANCP header with no body, however the message MAY contain one or
   more TLVs that are meant to communicate any relevant information to
   an application.  The payload of a Release Response Message indicating
   Failure MUST contain a Status-Info TLV (0x12) (as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] ) followed by the Target TLV.  Other TLVs
   MAY be present.  A Release Response Message indicating Failure MUST
   be sent whenever a Policy Configuration Message cannot be fulfilled
   or results in an execution error.  The Cmnd Nmbr parameter in the
   Status-Info TLV SHOULD be set to 0x00.

   The following values are defined for the Result Code field in the
   Status-Info TLV contained in a Release Response Status Message:

   0x00 - Success

   0x01 - Malformed message

   0x02 - Command not supported

   0x08 - Unrecognized Target

   0x10 - Transaction-id out of sequence

   0x16 - Fail to Activate the Target

6.  New Capabilities

   [I-D.ietf-ancp-protocol] defines a capability negotiation mechanism
   as well as a number of capabilities.

   This document defines the following generic Network Anti-Attack
   Capability Type:

   o Capability Type : Network Anti-Attack = 0x05

   Length (in bytes) : 1

   Capability Data (1 byte): The following values are defined:

   + 0x00: Reserved

   + 0x01: "MAC Black List"

   + 0x02: "MAC White List"

   + 0x03: "MAC Table Size Limitation"

   + 0x04: "MAC Rate Limitation"

   + 0x05: "Policy Timer"

   + other values: Reserved

   Both the NAS and the AN MUST advertise the Network Anti-Attack
   capability in their originated adjacency messages when they support
   it.  Initially, they indicate the full set of anti-attack sub-
   capabilities that they respectively support by putting all the
   relative Capability Data values into the adjacency messages.  Then,
   if a received adjacency message indicates that the originating device
   supports a smaller set of sub-capabilities than the device receiving
   the message, the receiving device will turn off the sub-capabilities
   that are not supported by the other device and will send an updated
   adjacency message with all the Capability Data values that now
   matches the ones of the other device.  This process will eventually
   result in both sides agreeing on the common set of supported sub-
   capabilities.

   For example, if the NAS supports "MAC Black List", "MAC White List"
   and "MAC Table Size Limitation" while the AN only supports "MAC Black
   List" and "MAC White List", the NAS will initially advertise the
   Network Anti-Attack capability with a respective Capability Data of
   0x01, 0x02 and 0x03.  On receipt of the adjacency message from the
   AN, the NAS will turn off its "MAC Table Size Limitation" sub-

   capability on the adjacency and will send a new adjacency message
   with a Network Anti-Attack capability containing a Capability Data of
   0x01 and 0x02.  From there on, the NAS and AN agree to make use of
   (only) the "MAC Black List" and "MAC White List" sub-capabilities.

1.  Introduction

   In addition to establishing connectivity, Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] has been used in real-time applications
   to establish that a peer is willing to receive packets.

   This document describes how Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   [RFC6347] is sufficient for establishing consent to receive packets,
   plus how this consent can be continuously refreshed.

   This also uses Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
   [I-D.ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg] to restrict that consent to specific
   uses.  Application protocol tokens are defined for the Real-Time
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] over DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764], WebRTC data
   channels [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] and a multiplexed combination
   of these two protocols.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   At times, this document falls back on shorthands for establishing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  These terms are defined in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Obtaining and Maintaining Receive Consent

   An endpoint MUST NOT send application data (in WebRTC, RTP or SCTP
   data) on a DTLS connection unless the receiving endpoint consents to
   receive the data.

Internet-Draft               Receive Consent               November 2013


   An endpoint that initiates or responds to a DTLS handshake that
   negotiates a specific application layer protocol (see Section 3)
   explicitly consents to receive packets containing the described
   protocol.

   Consent expires after a fixed amount of time.  Explicit consent to
   receive is indicated by the receiving endpoint sending authenticated
   packets from the inverted 5-tuple.  An endpoint uses the receipt of
   packets as an indication that the remote endpoint still consents to
   receive data.

   Any packet received from the inverted 5-tuple refreshes consent if
   the packet is successfully validated by the protocol's authentication
   check (for instance, a MAC).  Any DTLS message is sufficient to
   refresh consent, since these contain a MAC.  For DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764],
   receipt of an authenticated SRTP packet is sufficient.

   Consent is ended immediately by receipt of a an authenticated message
   that closes the connection (for instance, a TLS fatal alert).

   Receipt of an unauthenticated end-of-session message (e.g., TCP FIN)
   does not indicate loss of consent.  Thus, an endpoint receiving an
   unauthenticated end-of-session message SHOULD continue sending media
   (over connectionless transport) or attempt to re-establish the
   connection (over connection-oriented transport) until consent expires
   or it receives an authenticated message revoking consent.

2.1.  Consent in WebRTC

   WebRTC applications MUST cease transmission on a connection if they
   have not received any valid, authenticated packets for 30 seconds.

   WebRTC applications that intend to maintain consent MUST send an
   authenticated packet at least every 10 seconds.  If there is no
   application data to send, the DTLS heartbeat extension [RFC6520] MUST
   be sent to maintain consent.  This reduces the probability that
   transient network failures cause consent expiration.

2.2.  The Role of ICE

   Given that DTLS is used to establish and maintain consent, ICE is
   only used to test and nominate candidate pairs.  This allows for the
   use of DTLS without ICE, though this is unlikely to work for
   endpoints with poor connectivity.

   If ICE is not employed, a DTLS server SHOULD use the denial of
   service countermeasures described in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6347];
   specifically the "HelloVerifyRequest" and the cookie that it carries.

2.3.  Relationship with Connection Liveness

   A connection is considered "live" if packets are received from a
   remote endpoint within an application-dependent period.

   A WebRTC application can request a notification when there are no
   packets received for a certain period.  Similarly, an application can
   request that heartbeats are sent after an interval shorter than 10
   seconds.  These two time intervals might be controlled by the same
   configuration item.

   Sending heartbeats at a high rate could allow a malicious application
   to generate congestion.  A WebRTC application MUST NOT be able to
   send heartbeats at a rate higher than 1 per second.

3.  Application Layer Protocol Identifiers

   The following ALPN identifiers are defined:

   RTP (0x52 0x54 0x50):  This token indicates that DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764]
      is acceptable or selected.

   SCTP (0x53 0x43 0x54 0x50):  This token indicates that WebRTC Data
      Channels [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] is acceptable or accepted.
      The DTLS record-layer carries encapsulated Stream Control
      Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] packets as described in
      [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].

   RTP+SCTP (0x52 0x54 0x50 0x2b 0x53 0x43 0x54 0x50):  This token
      indicates that both DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] and WebRTC Data Channels
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] are acceptable or selected.  The
      DTLS record-layer carries encapsulated SCTP packets as described
      in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps]; this is multiplexed with
      SRTP [RFC3711] packets as described in [RFC5764].

   An application that can use a multiplexed combination of SRTP and
   SCTP MUST select "RTP+SCTP" if it is available, even if it is not
   using both protocols initially.  This avoids any need to renegotiate
   application layer protocols as usage needs change.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a security mechanism.

   Consent does not establish any bounds on the volume of packets that a
   receiver is willing to accept.  A receiver that receives packets at a
   rate in excess of what it is willing to tolerate can close the
   connection.  If the close message is lost, this can result in

   unwanted data being received until consent expires (i.e., 30
   seconds).

   SRTP is encrypted and authenticated with symmetric keys; that is,
   both sender and receiver know the keys.  With two party sessions,
   receipt of an authenticated packet from the single remote party is a
   strong assurance the packet came from that party.  However, when a
   session involves more than two parties, all of whom know each others
   keys, any of those parties could have sent (or spoofed) the packet.
   Such shared key distributions are possible with some MIKEY [RFC3830]
   modes, Security Descriptions [RFC4568], and EKT
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-srtp-ekt].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers three identifiers in the "Application Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" established by
   [I-D.ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg].

   Protocol:  RTP over DTLS-SRTP

   Identification Sequence:  0x52 0x54 0x50 ("RTP")

   Specification:  This document.

   Protocol:  WebRTC Data Channels

   Identification Sequence:  0x53 0x43 0x54 0x50 ("SCTP")

   Specification:  This document.

   Protocol:  RTP over DTLS-SRTP multiplexed with WebRTC Data Channels

   Identification Sequence:  0x52 0x54 0x50 0x2b 0x53 0x43 0x54 0x50
      ("RTP+SCTP")

   Specification:  This document.

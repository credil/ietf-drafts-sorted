             Location Measurements for IEEE 802.16e Devices
              draft-thomson-geopriv-wimax-measurements-04

Abstract

   IEEE 802.16e defines means for true mobility within an 802.16
   wireless network.  Determining an accurate location for 802.16e
   devices requires information on radio parameters.  A format is
   defined for location-related measurement data that can be provided by
   an 802.16e device.  This measurement data can be used by a Location
   Information Server (LIS) to more accurately determine the location of
   the device.  A separate measurement used for identifying WiMAX
   session-related parameters is also provided.

Internet-Draft      Location Measurements for 802.16e          July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Determining the location of a device in an IEEE 802.16e [IEEE.80216E]
   mobile wireless network requires information from the device to
   improve the accuracy of the final result.  Radio timing information
   provided by the device can enable the calculation of a more accurate
   location estimate by a Location Information Server (LIS).

   This document describes a standard format for 802.16e measurement
   data that is based on radio measurements made of base stations near
   the device.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   This document builds on [I-D.ietf-geopriv-held-measurements] and
   consequently uses the same set of terminology.  Terminology from
   [IEEE.80216E] is used where appropriate.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  802.16e Radio Measurement Data

   A subscriber station (SS) in an 802.16e network is able to observe
   radio signals from each base station (BS) in its proximity.  By
   observing the timing and strength of these signals, a SS is able to
   provide a LIS with information that can be used to determine its
   location.

   The most basic 802.16e measurement indicates the serving BS, as shown
   in Figure 1.

     <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
       <locationType exact="true">civic</locationType>
       <measurements xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm">
         <w16e xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm:802.16e">
           <servingBS id="00-21-43-65-87-a9"/>
         </w16e>
       </measurements>
     </locationRequest>

       Figure 1: HELD Location Request with 802.16e Measurement Data

   More measurement information can be provided, including timing
   measurement information for additional serving base stations (if fast
   base station switching (FBSS) or macro-diversity hand-over (MDHO) are
   in progress).  Information on neighbouring base stations can be
   provided in addition to that for the serving BS.

   The set of measurement data is chosen by the SS and the presence of
   specific elements will depend on the time the SS has available to
   acquire the measurements.  The following measurement information may
   be provided:

   id:  (Attribute) The base station identifier for the measured BS.
      Note that while this isn't a MAC address, it shares the encoding
      defined for the MAC address.

   rssi:  Receive signal strength indicator, calculated as defined in
      [IEEE.80216E].  This value is measured in units of dBm.  This
      datum optionally includes an RMS error in dB and sample count.

   cinr:  Carrier inteference to noise ratio (signal to noise),
      calculated as defined in [IEEE.80216E].  This value is measured in
      units of dB.  This datum optionally includes an RMS error and
      sample count.

   rd:  Relative delay of the signal from the BS, measured relative to
      other base stations.  Since this value is relative, it MUST be
      included on at least two BS measurements to be of any use.  It is
      RECOMMENDED that this value be set to "0" for the first BS in the
      measured set.  This datum optionally includes an RMS error and
      sample count.

                                (V)
                                 |
                                 |
                                 | BS3

                       Figure 2: Relative Delay Example

      Based on the example in Figure 2, relative delay can be calculated
      based on the relative time that signals transmitted simultaneously
      (or with known relative times) by base stations can be calculated.
      If the time of receipt of the signal from each base station is
      t[x] and the relative delay for BS1 is set to zero, the relative
      time for each subsequent measured base station is t[x] - t[1].

   rtd:  Round trip delay of the signal from the SS to the BS and back.
      This measurement datum is only applicable for each serving BS.
      This value is measured in seconds.  This datum optionally includes
      an RMS error and sample count.

   The "rmsError" attribute for signal to noise and received signal
   strength MAY be calculated using the continuous weighted average
   method described in [IEEE.80216E].  Values of "alpha_AVG" and "k" are
   selected by the SS.

   The XML format described in this document provides a greater range of
   values than the Scanning Results Report ("MOB_SCN-REP") or the
   Channel measurement Report Response ("REP-RSP") message.  This allows
   for the reporting of measurements in a manner less constrained by
   encoding.  A greater range of values does not necessarily imply
   anything about the uncertainty in those measurements; the RMS error
   is used to indicate the magnitude of any error.

3.1.  Measurement Request Parameters

   A request that does not contain sufficient measurement data can
   result in an error response.  [I-D.ietf-geopriv-held-measurements]
   defines a measurement request that indicates what parameters might be
   necessary to complete the request.  These parameters might also be
   present in a response that includes an indication that the requested
   location quality [I-D.thomson-geopriv-location-quality] was not
   provided.

   The elements present in a radio measurement are all optional.  In
   order for a Device to know which of these is requested, the
   "parameter" element is defined for radio measurement data.  This
   identifies each requested element using a qualified name.

   The following example shows a HELD error response that indicates that
   RSSI and CINR measurement would aid in fulfilling the request.

     <error xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"
            code="locationUnknown">
       <message xml:lang="en">Insufficient measurement data</message>
       <measurementRequest
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm"
           xmlns:w16e="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm:802.16e">
         <measurement type="w16e:w16e">
           <w16e:parameter>w16e:rssi</wifi:parameter>
           <w16e:parameter>w16e:cinr</wifi:parameter>
         </measurement>
       </measurementRequest>
     </error>

4.  WiMAX Session-Related Measurements

   In Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) networks
   [WiMAX.LBS], an SS might have a particular access network designated
   as a "home network".  In some configurations the network is designed
   in such a way that the SS only has access to a location server in the
   home network, known as a home location server, or hLS.  However, a
   server in the current (visited) access network - the vLS - could be
   the only server that is capable of communicating with the access
   network to determine the location of the SS.  In this case the hLS
   provides WiMAX session information to the vLS, giving the vLS the
   information necessary to identify a session and generate location
   information.

   Figure 4 shows an example measurement that contains information
   regarding a session.  This contains the session identifier that is
   assigned by the anchor authenticator.  The Network Access Identifier
   (NAI) [RFC4282] of the device and the address of the anchor
   authenticator is included.

     <measurements xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm">
       <wimaxSession xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm:802.16e">
         <sessionID>19abd9e9f923978f80310d</sessionID>
         <nai>user.206417@example.realm</nai>
         <anchor ip="2001:DB8::f:301">f-301.aa.example.com</anchor>
       </wimaxSession>
     </measurements>

                                 Figure 4

   Session parameters are used to identify a particular network
   attachment session:

   sessionID:  A temporary identifier given to a particular session.
      This value is a binary value that is expressed in hexadecimal.

   nai:  The NAI [RFC4282] used by the device to gain network
      authorization.

   anchor:  The domain name of the anchor authenticator in the visited
      network.  Optionally, this includes an attribute that indicates an
      IP address in addition to the domain name.

   The formal grammar for NAI [RFC4282] permits invalid UTF-8, which
   cannot be expressed using XML.  Therefore, this lexical
   representation of NAI permits escaping.  Non-unicode characters (and
   any other character) are expressed using a backslash ('\') followed
   by two hexadecimal digits representing the value of a single octet.

   The value-space representation of an NAI is the sequence of octets
   that is produced from the concatenation of UTF-8 encoded sequences of
   unescaped characters and octets derived from escaped components.
   This sequence MUST conform to the constraints in [RFC4282].

6.  Security Considerations

   The considerations of [I-D.ietf-geopriv-held-measurements] apply.
   The receiver of 802.16e measurement information requires knowledge of
   the location of base stations to make effective use of the
   information.

   NAI is used as identification information for a device.  The
   connection of this information with other session parameters provides
   a potential link between identity and location.  In addition, unless
   care is taken to verify this information, this datum could be
   exploited by an attacker to gain access to another user's location
   information.  See the privacy and security considerations of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-held-identity-extensions] for details on using
   identity parameters.

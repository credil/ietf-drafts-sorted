1.  Introduction

   Civic address information ([RFC4776], [RFC5139]) can be used to
   describe the location of an entity in terms of the human-constructed
   environment.  This description can be be made more or less precise
   through the addition or removal of labels (respectively).

   A less precise civic address can be used to describe a zone or region
   by only including sufficient labels to identify the region.  This
   method is used in the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol
   [RFC5222], to convey information to a client about the extents of a
   particular region where service is guaranteed to be consistent.

   This information, called a service boundary, allows a client to make
   decisions about civic addresses other than the one used to query.  If
   another civic address is determined to be "within" the service
   boundary, the client does not need to request service information
   from the LoST server.

   LoST does not provide a definition of "within" for civic addresses.
   This document describes an algorithm that provides a definition for
   whether a civic address is contained within another address.

   Other operations on civic addresses are described, allowing client
   software to make decisions about the intersection and union of two
   civic addresses.

2.  Civic Address Model

   The simplest model of a civic address is that which considers it as
   an unordered set of labels.  Each label is assigned zero or more
   values; each value has an associated language (and script).

   The format in RFC 4776 [RFC4776] allows for values to be given to
   labels with different languages or scripts.  No special
   considerations apply in applying this model.

   The format in RFC 5139 [RFC5139] uses multiple "civicAddress"
   elements to form a single address if labels are provided in multiple
   languages.  Thus, when extracting address information from a PIDF-LO
   [RFC4119] document, a civic address in this model is formed from all
   "civicAddress" elements in the same tuple.

   A civic address describes a series of spatial partitions or regions.
   Every address includes an implied partition that identifies the
   habited portion of the Earth.  Every label with a value describes a
   partition of space at a specific scale.  The intersection of the
   spaces described by all the included labels is the resulting
   location.

   The algorithm described in this document relies on the following
   rule:

      The location described by a set of civic address labels is
      entirely contained within the location described by any subset of
      those labels.

   The following characteristics of civic addresses have no bearing on
   the algorithms described:

   1.  The civic address formats of [RFC4776] and [RFC5139] include a
       limited set of hierarchical elements.  The "country" and "A1"
       through "A6" labels follow a strict hierarchy.  The algorithms
       described do not rely on this hierarchy.

   2.  The physical region described by a civic address is not
       necessarily contiguous.  For instance, an address might omit a
       thoroughfare name, but include a house number of 23.  Such an
       address identifies every house at number 23 within the area
       described by other labels.

   More sophisticated models and algorithms are possible in the presence
   of additional information about the address data.  If this sort of
   information is present, many more options are available for
   processing addresses.  The simple algorithms in this document operate

   on the address information only, but do not preclude use of outside
   information.

3.  Civic Address Boundaries

   A civic address boundary has the same format as a civic address.

   A civic address boundary describes a region by containing fewer
   labels than the addresses of locations contained within the boundary.
   In that respect, the boundary might be considered an incomplete
   address, allthough a boundary is actually a valid civic address that
   simply describes a larger location.

   A larger region is described by including fewer labels; a smaller
   region might be described by including more labels, or labels that
   are more specific.

   For example, if the described region is the province of Zeeland in
   the Netherlands, only two labels are required: a country of "NL" and
   an A1 field of "ZE".

   A label that is omitted from the civic address boundary indicates
   that civic addresses within the boundary may have any value for the
   label.

   This process does not provide any assurance that a civic address
   exists, only that if it does exist, it is contained entirely within
   the described boundary.  Determining whether such an address actually
   exists usually requires additional information, and is therefore not
   considered by this document.

3.1.  Determining if an Address is Within a Boundary

   A civic address is entirely enclosed within a boundary if every label
   of the boundary that has a value has an equivalent value in the
   address.  A civic address boundary can entirely enclose another civic
   address boundary.

   Case folding is performed on values before comparison.

   A label is considered equivalent if at least one value from the
   boundary has the same value in the address for the same language (and
   script).  If values are provided in multiple languages, any language
   that is present in both boundary and address can be used.

   [[TBD: If the label contains different values for the same language,
   does this override the above - in light of the Austrian example
   below, it's probably better that the more lenient equivalence test is
   used.]]

   Labels that have the same value, but a different language, are not

Internet-Draft              Civic Boundaries                   July 2010


   equivalent.  Without information on different translations of the
   label, the label must be considered to be different.

3.2.  Algorithm Summary

   The algorithm for determining whether an address is contained
   entirely within a given boundary can be summarized by the following
   pseudocode:

      SET iswithin = true
      FOR EACH label IN boundary DO:
         IF boundary[label] exists THEN:
            SET equivalent = false
            FOR lang IN boundary[label] DO:
               IF boundary[label][lang] == address[label][lang] THEN:
                  SET equivalent = true
               END
            END
            IF NOT equivalent THEN SET iswithin = false
         END
      END
      RETURN iswithin

3.3.  False Negatives

   This test can produce false negatives for a number of reasons:

   1.  A particular label might be specified with different languages in
       the boundary and the address.  This label might be considered
       equivalent if the two values have the same meaning.

       For instance, the German city Muenchen is known as Munich in
       English - knowledge of this translation is required to determine
       that these two values are equivalent.

   2.  A label might have equivalent values, but subtly different
       language tags [RFC5646] that result in a failed comparison.

       For instance, in many cases, a language tag of "en" is not
       significantly different from variants that use the same primary
       language subtag.  Identical values with "en" and "en-US" or
       "en-Latn" would compare as different, even though the latter two
       tags are simply more specific than the first.  Even "en-GB" is
       rarely different to these for text that is used in addressing.

       For creators of civic addresses and boundaries, the guidance in
       [RFC5646], Section 4.1 recommends that subtags are only added if
       they include useful distinguishing information.  This is intended



Thomson & Wolf          Expires January 28, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              Civic Boundaries                   July 2010


       to avoid processing errors such as this.  This guidance is
       particularly relevant in relation to use of CAtype 128 (script)
       in the binary encoding of [RFC4776], which is often unnecessarily
       specified.

   3.  The address might use different labels than the boundary to
       produce the same result.

       For instance, a boundary might use labels "A1" through "A6" to
       describe a location, whereas the same location is described using
       a postal code in place of these elements.  The address is within
       the described boundary, but this cannot be determined without
       knowing that the postal code and A-labels are equivalent.

       In some countries, specific address codes can be used to replace
       some or all of the other address labels.  In some instances, an
       address consisting of the country and the "ADDCODE" label can be
       sufficiently descriptive for an application; however, this would
       not be identified as being within a boundary that was specified
       using other address labels.

   4.  There are many cases where a value can be expressed in different
       ways.  This includes abbreviations, commonly accepted
       misspellings, and generally recognized variations in addresses.

       For instance, abbreviations are common for thoroughfare suffixes,
       like "Street" ("St." or "St") or "Road" ("Rd." or "Rd").

       In another example, the Austrian addressing recommendations
       [RFC5774] let certain labels contain either a code or a
       descriptive name.  Without knowing that "Oberbaumgarten" and
       "Oberbaumgarten;1208" refer to the same Katastralgemeindenamen,
       these values must be considered to be different.

   By using additional information, a system might be able to identify
   more equivalent labels than the basic algorithm.  This can remove
   some, if not all such false negatives.  However, a system should not
   rely on another system having and employing such knowledge.

3.4.  False Positives

   This algorithm guarantees, that a civic address that exists is
   entirely contained within a boundary.

   No allowance is made for addresses that do no exist.  It is trivially
   possible to construct a non-sensical or non-existent civic address
   that is considered "within" a boundary using this algorithm.  This
   can be done by starting with the civic address boundary and adding

Internet-Draft              Civic Boundaries                   July 2010


   arbitrary values to labels that do not already have values.

3.5.  Address Boundary Limitations

   The address format allows a limited expression for address
   boundaries.  This representation can only be used in limited
   applications.  This simple boundary expression is not suitable for
   any application that is sensitive to false negatives.

   In the case of boundary interchange between LoST servers
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost-sync] would likely require multiple specific
   boundaries to describe a single boundary.  A number of well-known
   cases would generate a very large number of such boundaries.  For
   instance, if a boundary runs up the middle of street that places odd
   and even house numbers on opposite sides of the street, each house on
   that street would require an individual address.

   Concatenation of address data can introduce other limitations.  The
   limited set of address labels can mean that each field can hold
   several discrete units of data.  An address mapping [RFC5774] might
   specify that underlying data be concatenated and mapped to a single
   label.

   The algorithm described here operates on entire labels only.  The
   algorithm and boundary expression does not allow only part of a label
   to change.  If concatenated data is included in the one label, a
   generic processer cannot know of this and distinguish between parts
   that must match and parts that do not matter.  To do so would require
   knowledge of the modes of concatenation, what delimiters were used
   and it would require syntax that distinguishes important parts from
   unimportant parts.

4.  Boundary Combining Algorithms

   In some cases, it might be necessary to combine boundaries.  This
   section describes three algorithms, including simple union and
   intersection.

4.1.  Boundary Unions

   The union of two civic address boundaries (or addresses) is a single
   boundary that contains all civic addresses that are contained within
   either original boundary.

   The boundary that forms the union of two other boundaries is formed
   of all labels that are equivalent in both boundaries.

   If labels differ in the two boundaries, then the resulting union
   might also include addresses that are in neither boundary.  Only use
   this algorithm if false positives are acceptable.

      SET union = empty address
      FOR EACH label IN boundary1,boundary2 DO:
         IF boundary1[label] EQUIV boundary2[label] THEN
            SET union[label] = boundary1[label]
         END
      END
      RETURN union

   The value of any label in a union of boundaries should include a
   value for all languages that are present in both boundaries.

4.2.  Boundary Intersections

   The intersection of two boundaries (or addresses) is a single
   boundary that contains all addresses that are found in both original
   boundaries.

   The boundary that forms the intersection of two other boundaries is
   formed of the combined value of the labels from both boundaries.

   If the value of any label is present in both boundaries, but not
   equivalent, the two boundaries do not intersect for the purposes of
   this algorithm.  In practice, while it is possible that two such
   boundaries could overlap, this algorithm cannot detect this.
   Furthermore, the civic address representation does not provide a way
   to express such an overlap.

Internet-Draft              Civic Boundaries                   July 2010


      SET intersection = empty address
      FOR EACH label IN boundary1,boundary2 DO:
         IF boundary1[label] exists AND boundary2[label] exists
             AND boundary1[label] NOT EQUIV boundary2[label] THEN
             ERROR No overlap
         END
         IF boundary1[label] exists THEN:
            SET intersection[label] = boundary1[label]
         ELSE
            SET intersection[label] = boundary2[label]
         END
      END
      RETURN intersection

   The value of any label in an intersection of boundaries may include a
   value for all languages that are present in both boundaries.

4.3.  Avoiding False Positives

   The service boundaries in LoST [RFC5222] rely on the absence of false
   positives when determining if an address is within a boundary.  False
   negatives are tolerated, because this only results in the LoST client
   making another request to discover an unchanged service.  A false
   positive is not desirable because a device could retain a service
   mapping that is likely to be invalid.

   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-rough-loc] describes an algorithm where an address is
   formed of the intersection of multiple boundaries.  If no
   intersection the result of this algorithm was failure, then usable
   location information cannot be provided to the LoST client.

   For a LoST service boundary, the goal is to provide a boundary that
   contains as few labels as possible.  For a rough location, the goal
   is to provide an address with as few labels as possible.  False
   positives are not desirable in either case.

   Thus, both cases have a similar goal, and both have a more precise
   address to operate on.  In LoST, this is the address used to query
   the server; for rough locations, this is the address that is to be
   hidden.

   To avoid false positives in determining whether an address falls
   within a boundary, labels from the more precise address are added.
   Any label where the inputs to the union or intersection disagree is
   given a value from the precise address.  This ensures that the
   resulting address or boundary entirely contains the precise address.

   Alternatively, given a precise address and a number of boundaries

   that are to be combined by either union or intersection, an address
   or boundary can be formed by removing all labels from the precise
   address that do not have a value in any boundary.  This algorithm
   produces an identical result.

      SET result = precise address
      FOR EACH label IN result DO:
         SET found = false
         FOR EACH boundary IN boundaries DO:
            IF boundary[label] exists THEN SET found = true
         END
         IF not found THEN CLEAR result[label]
      END
      RETURN result

5.  Example

   The following civic address boundary (shown in XML form [RFC5139]),
   describes a region of Los Angeles, USA.

      <civicAddress
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">
        <country>US</country>
        <A1>CA</A1>
        <A2>Orange</A2>
        <A3>Los Angeles</A3>
        <A4>Anaheim</A4>
        <PC>92802</PC>
      </civicAddress>

   The following address includes additional labels, it does not change
   the value of any label.

      <civicAddress
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">
        <country>US</country>
        <A1>CA</A1>
        <A2> Orange </A2>
        <A3>Los Angeles</A3>
        <A4>Anaheim</A4>
        <PRD>South</PRD><RD>Harbor</RD><STS>Boulevard</STS>
        <HNO>1313</HNO><NAM>Disneyland</NAM>
        <PC>92802</PC>
      </civicAddress>

   An equivalent address that would not be considered "within" the
   boundary by the generic algorithm would be one that specified "Orange
   County" for the "A2" label.  It's also possible to unambiguously
   describe the location without fields "A1" through "A4", since a ZIP
   (postal) code of "92802" provides sufficient information.

   Thus, the following variant is not considered "within" the boundary,
   even if it is the same address.  That is, without context-specific
   knowledge, the algorithm produces a false negative on this address.

      <civicAddress
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">
        <country>US</country>
        <PRD>South</PRD><RD>Harbor</RD><STS>Boulevard</STS>
        <HNO>1313</HNO><NAM>Disneyland</NAM>
        <PC>92802</PC>
      </civicAddress>

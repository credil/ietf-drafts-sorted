Abstract 

   The purpose of this document is to provide applicability of Access 
   Node Control Mechanism, as described in [ANCP-FRAMEWORK], to PON 
   based broadband access. The need for an Access Node Control Mechanism 
   between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node Complex (a 
   combination of Optical Line Termination (OLT) and Optical Network 
   Termination (ONT) elements), is described in a multi-service 
   reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related, service-
   related and Subscriber-related operations. The Access Node Control 
   Mechanism is also extended for interaction between components of the 
   Access Node Complex (OLT and ONT). The Access Node Control mechanism 
   will ensure that the transmission of the information does not need to 
   go through distinct element managers but rather uses a direct device-
   device communication. This allows for performing access link related 
   operations within those network elements to meet performance 
   objectives.

2  Introduction 

   Passive Optical Networks (PONs) based on BPON and GPON are being 
   deployed across carrier networks. There are two models for PON 
   deployment: Fiber to the curb (FTTC), and Fiber to the Premise 
   (FTTP). In the FTTC deployment, the last mile connectivity is 
   provided over the local loop using Very High Speed DSL. In the FTTP 
   case, PON extends to the premise. In addition, there are three main 
   PON technologies: (1) Broadband PON (BPON), (2) Gigabit PON (GPON), 
   and (3) Ethernet PON (EPON). The focus in the document will be on 
   BPON and GPON in the context of FTTP deployment. 
 
   BPON and GPON in FTTP deployments provide large bandwidth in the 
   first mile, bandwidth that is an order of magnitude larger than that 
   provided by xDSL. In the downstream direction BPON provides 622 Mbps 
   per PON while GPON provides 2.4 Gbps. In residential deployments, the 
   number of homes sharing the same PON is limited by the technology and 
   the network engineering rules. Typical deployments have 32 homes per 
   PON. 
 
   The motive behind BPON and GPON deployment is providing triple-play 
   services over IP: voice, video and data. Voice is generally low 
   bandwidth but has low-delay, low-jitter, and low packet-loss 
   requirements. Data services (e.g., Internet services) often require 
   high throughput and can tolerate medium latency. Data services may 
   include multimedia content download such as video. However, in that 
   case, the video content is not required to be real-time and/or it is 
   low quality video. Video services, on the other hand, are targeted to 
   deliver Standard Definition or High Definition video content in real-
   time or near-real time, depending on the service model. Standard 
   Definition content using MPEG2 encoding requires on the order of 3.75 
   Mbps per stream while High definition content using MPEG2 encoding 
   requires on the order of 15-19 Mbps depending on the level of 
   compression used. Video services require low-jitter and low-packet 
   loss with low start-time latency. There are two types of video 
   services: on demand and broadcast (known also as liner programming 
   content). While linear programming content can be provided over 
   Layer1 on the PON, the focus in this document is on delivering linear 
   programming content over IP to the home, using IP multicast. Video on 
   demand is also considered for delivery over IP using a unicast 
   session model.

   Providing simultaneous triple-play services over IP with unicast 
   video and multicast video, VoIP and data requires an architecture 
   that preserves the quality of service of each service. Fundamental to 
   this architecture is ensuring the video content (unicast and 
   multicast) delivered to the user does not exceed the bandwidth 
   allocated to the user for video services. Architecture models often 
   ensure that data is guaranteed a minimum bandwidth and that VoIP is 
   guaranteed its own bandwidth. In addition, QoS control across 
   services is often performed at a Network Access Server (NAS), often 
   referred to as Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) for subscriber 
   management, per subscriber and shared link resources. Efficient 
   multicast video services require enabling multicast services in the 
   access network between the subscriber and the subscriber management 
   platform. In the FTTP PON environment, this implies enabling IP 
   multicast on the Access Node (AN) complex composed of the ONT and 
   OLT, as applicable. This is as opposed to DSL deployments where 
   multicast is enabled on the DSLAM only. The focus in this document 
   will be on the ANCP requirements needed for coordinated admission 
   control of unicast and multicast video in FTTP PON environments 
   between the AN complex and the NAS, specifically focusing on 
   bandwidth dedicated for multicast and shared bandwidth between 
   multicast and unicast. 
 
   [ANCP-FRAMEWORK] provides the framework and requirements for 
   coordinated admission control between a NAS and an AN with special 
   focus on DSL deployments. This document proposes the extension of 
   that framework and the related requirements to explicitly address 
   BPON and GPON deployments. 
    
2.1 Terminology 

   o PON (Passive Optical Network): a point-to-multipoint fiber to the 
     premises network architecture in which unpowered splitters are 
     used to enable the splitting of an optical signal from a central 
     office on a single optical fiber to multiple premises. Up to 32-
     128 may be supported on the same PON. A PON configuration consists 
     of an Optical Line Termination (OLT) at the Service Provider's CO 
     and a number of Optical Network Units or Terminals (ONU/ONT) near 
     end users, with an optical distribution network (ODN) composed of 
     fibers and splitters between them. A PON configuration reduces the 
     amount of fiber and CO equipment required compared with point to 
     point architectures. 

   o Access Node Complex (ANX): The Access Node is decomposed by two 
     geographical functions, performed by OLT and ONU/ONT. The general 
     term Access Node (ANX) will be used when describing a 
     functionality which does not depend on the physical location but 
     rather on the "black box" behaviour of OLT and ONU/ONT.

        o Optical Line Terminal (OLT): is located in the Service 
          provider's central office. It terminates and aggregates 
          multiple PONs (providing fiber access to multiple premises or 
          neighborhoods) on the user side, and interfaces with the 
          service element (NAS) providing subscriber management.

 

        o Optical Network Terminal (ONT): terminates PON on the network 
          side and provides PON adaptation. The user side interface and 
          the location of the ONT is dictated by the type of network 
          deployment. For a Fiber-to-the-Premise (FTTP) deployment 
          (with Fiber all the way to the apartment or living unit), ONT 
          has Ethernet (FE/GE/MoCA) connectivity with the Home Gateway 
          (HGW)/Customer Premise Equipment (CPE). In case of an MDU 
          (multi-dwelling or multi-tenant unit), a multi-subscriber ONU 
          typically resides in the basement or a wiring closet, and has 
          FE/GE/Ethernet over VDSL connectivity with each CPE. In the 
          case where fiber is terminated outside the premise 
          (neighborhood or curb side) on an ONT/ONU, the last-leg-
          premise connections could be via existing or new Copper, with 
          xDSL physical layer (typically VDSL). In this case, the 
          Access Node (OLT & ONT together) effectively is a "PON fed 
          DSLAM". 

   o Network Access Server (NAS): Network element which aggregates 
     subscriber traffic from a number of ANs or ANXs. The NAS is often 
     an injection point for policy management and IP QoS in the access 
     network. It is also referred to as Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) 
     or Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS).  

   o Home Gateway (HGW): Network element that connects subscriber 
     devices to the AN or ANX and the access network. In case of DSL, 
     the Home Gateway is a DSL network termination that could either 
     operate as a Layer 2 bridge or as a Layer 3 router. In the latter 
     case, such a device is also referred to as a Routing Gateway (RG). 
     In the case of PON, it is often a Layer3 routing device with the 
     ONT performing PON termination. 

   o PON-Customer-ID: This is an identifier which uniquely identifies 
     the ANX and the access loop logical port on the ANX to the 
     customer premise, and is used in any interaction between NAS and 
     ANX that relates to access-loops. Logically it is composed of 
     information containing identification of the OLT (the OLT may be 
     physically directly connected to the NAS), the PON port on the 
     OLT, the ONT, and the port on the ONT connecting to the customer 
     HGW. When acting as a DHCP relay agent, the OLT can encode PON-
     Customer-ID in the "Agent-Circuit-Identifier" Sub-option in 
     Option-82 of the DHCP messages.

3  Reference Architecture for PON Based Broadband Access Network 

   The reference architecture used in this document is based on Ethernet 
   aggregation for both of BPON and GPON. Specifically, the following 
   cases are addressed: 

     o BPON with Ethernet uplink to the BNG and ATM on the PON side. 

     o GPON with Ethernet uplink to the BNG and Ethernet on the PON 
        side. 

     In case of an Ethernet aggregation network that supports new QoS-
     enabled IP services (including Ethernet multicast replication), 
     the architecture builds on the reference architecture specified in 
     DSL Forum [TR-101]. The Ethernet aggregation network between a NAS 
     and an OLT may be degenerated to one or more direct physical 
     Ethernet links. 

     Given the industry's move towards Ethernet as the new access and   
     aggregation technology for triple play services, the primary focus   
     throughout this document is on GPON and BPON with Ethernet between 
     the BNG and the OLT. Figures 1 and 2 depict an end-to-end 
     broadband network with PON access.

3.1 Home Gateway 

   The Home Gateway (HGW) connects the different Customer Premises 
   Equipment (CPE) to the ANX and the access network.  In case of PON, 
   the HGW is a layer 3 router. In this case, the HGW performs DHCP 
   assignment to devices within the home, and performs Network Address 
   and Port Translation (NAPT) between the LAN and WAN side. In case of 
   FTTP, the HGW connects to the ONT over an Ethernet interface. That 
   Ethernet interface could be a physical port or over another medium. 
   In case of FTTP, it is possible to have a single box GPON CPE 
   solution, where the ONT encompasses the HGW functionality as well
   as the GPON adaptation function. 

 
3.2 PON Access  

   PON access is composed of the ONT and OLT. PON ensures physical 
   connectivity between the ONT at the customer premises and the OLT. 
   PON framing can be BPON (in case of BPON) or GPON (in case of GPON).  
   The protocol encapsulation on BPON is based on multi-protocol    
   encapsulation over AAL5, defined in [RFC2684].  This covers PPP over    
   Ethernet (PPPoE, defined in [RFC2516]), or bridged IP (IPoE). The 
   protocol encapsulation on GPON is always IPoE. In all cases, the 
   connection between the AN (OLT) and the NAS (BNG) is assumed to be 
   Ethernet in this document. 

3.3 Access Node Complex 

   This is composed of OLT and ONT and is defined in section 2.1. 

    

3.4 Access Node Complex Uplink to the BNG 

   The ANX uplink connects the OLT to the NAS. The fundamental 
   requirements for the ANX uplink are to provide traffic aggregation, 
   Class of Service distinction and customer separation and 
   traceability. This can be achieved using an ATM or an Ethernet based

   technology. The focus in this document is on Ethernet as stated 
   earlier. 

3.5 Aggregation Network 

   The aggregation network provides traffic aggregation towards the NAS.   
   The Aggregation network is assumed to be Ethernet in this document.  

 
3.6 Network Access Server 

   The NAS is a network device which aggregates multiplexed Subscriber 
   traffic from a number of ANXs. The NAS plays a central role in per-
   subscriber policy enforcement and QoS. It is often referred to as a 
   Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) or Broadband Remote Access Server 
   (BRAS). A detailed definition of the NAS is given in [RFC2881]. The 
   NAS interfaces to the aggregation network by means of 802.1Q or 802.1 
   Q-in-Q Ethernet interfaces, and towards the Regional Network by means 
   of transport interfaces (e.g. GigE, PPP over SONET). The NAS 
   functionality corresponds to the BNG functionality described in DSL 
   Forum TR-101. In addition to this, the NAS supports the Access Node 
   Control functionality defined for the respective use cases in this 
   document.  

 
3.7 Regional Network 

   The Regional Network connects one or more NAS and associated Access 
   Networks to Network Service Providers (NSPs) and Application Service 
   Providers (ASPs). The NSP authenticates access and provides and   
   manages the IP address to Subscribers.  It is responsible for overall   
   service assurance and includes Internet Service Providers (ISPs).The 
   ASP provides application services to the application Subscriber 
   (gaming, video, content on demand, IP telephony etc.). The NAS can 
   be part of the NSP network. Similarly, the NSP can be the ASP. 

  
 
 
4   Motivation for explicit extension of ANCP to FTTP PON  

   The fundamental difference between PON and DSL is that a PON is an 
   optical broadcast network by definition. That is, at the PON level, 
   every ONT on the same PON sees the same signal. However, the ONT 
   filters only those PON frames addressed to it. Encryption is used on 
   the PON to prevent eavesdropping.  

   The broadcast PON capability is very suitable to delivering multicast 
   content to connected premises, maximizing bandwidth usage efficiency 
   on the PON. Similar to DSL deployments, enabling multicast on the 
   Access Node Complex (ANX) provides for bandwidth use efficiency on 
   the path between the Access Node and the NAS as well as improves the 
   scalability of the NAS by reducing the amount of multicast traffic 
   being replicated at the NAS. However, the broadcast capability on the

Internet-Draft            draft-bitar-wadhwa-ancp-pon-03    March 2010 
    




   PON enables the AN (OLT) to send one copy on the PON as opposed to N 
   copies of a multicast channel on the PON serving N premises being 
   receivers. The PON multicast capability can be leveraged in the case 
   of GPON and BPON as discussed in this document.    

   Fundamental to leveraging the broadcast capability on the PON for 
   multicast delivery is the ability to assign a single encryption key 
   for all PON frames carrying all multicast channels or a key per set 
   of multicast channels that correspond to service packages, or none. 
   It should be noted that the ONT can be a multi-Dwelling Unit (MDU) 
   ONT with multiple Ethernet ports, each connected to a living unit. 
   Thus, the ONT must not only be able to receive a multicast frame, but 
   must also be able to forward that frame only to the Ethernet port 
   with receivers for the corresponding channel.  

  
   In order to implement triple-play service delivery with necessary 
   "quality-of-experience", including end-to-end bandwidth optimized 
   multicast video delivery, there needs to be tight coordination 
   between the NAS and the ANX. This interaction needs to be near real-
   time as services are requested via application or network level 
   signaling by broadband subscribers. ANCP as defined in [ANCP-
   FRAMEWORK] for DSL based networks is very suitable to realize a 
   control protocol (with transactional exchange capabilities), between 
   PON enabled ANX and the NAS, and also between the components 
   comprising the ANX i.e. between OLT and the ONT. Typical use cases 
   for ANCP in PON environment include the following: 

     o Multicast  

          o Optimized multicast delivery 

          o Unified video resource control 

          o NAS based provisioning of ANX 

     o Access topology discovery 

     o Remote connectivity check 

 
 
5  Concept of Access Node Control Mechanism for PON based access 

   The high-level communication framework for an Access Node Control 
   Mechanism is shown in Figure 3. The Access Node Control Mechanism 
   defines a quasi real-time, general-purpose method for multiple 
   network scenarios with an extensible communication scheme, addressing 
   the different use cases that are described in the sections that 
   follow. The access node control mechanism is also extended to run 
   between OLT and ONT. The mechanism consists of control function, and 
   reporting and/or enforcement function. Controller function is used to 
   receive status information or admission requests from the reporting 
   function.  It is also used to trigger a certain behavior in the

   network element where the reporting and/or enforcement function 
   resides. 

   The reporting function is used to convey status information to the 
   controller function that requires the information for executing local 
   functions. The enforcement function can be contacted by the 
   controller function to enforce a specific policy or trigger a local 
   action. The messages shown in Figure 3 show the conceptual message 
   flow.  The actual use of these flows, and the times or frequencies 
   when these messages are generated depend on the actual use cases, 
   which are described in later sections.

6  Multicast  

   With the rise of supporting IPTV services in a resource-efficient   
   way, multicast services are becoming increasingly important. 

   In order to gain bandwidth optimization with multicast, the 
   replication of multicast content per access-loop needs to be 
   distributed to the ANX. This can be done by ANX (OLT and ONT) 
   becoming multicast aware by implementing an IGMP snooping and/or 
   proxy function. The replication thus needs to be distributed between 
   NAS, aggregation nodes, and ANX. In case of GPON, and in case of 
   BPON with Ethernet uplink, this is very viable. By introducing IGMP 
   processing on the ANX and aggregation nodes, the multicast 
   replication process is now divided between the NAS, the aggregation 
   node(s) and ANX. This is in contrast to the ATM-based model, where 
   NAS is the single element responsible for all multicast control and 
   replication. In order to ensure backward compatibility with the ATM-
   based model, the NAS, aggregation node and ANX need to behave as a 
   single logical device. This logical device must have exactly the same 
   functionality as the NAS in the ATM access/aggregation network.  The 
   Access Node Control Mechanism can be used to make sure that this 
   logical/functional equivalence is achieved by exchanging the 
   necessary information between the ANX and the NAS. 

   An alternative to multicast awareness in the ANX is for the 
   subscriber to communicate the IGMP "join/leave" messages with the 
   NAS, while the ANX is being transparent to these messages. In this 
   scenario, the NAS can use ANCP to create replication state in the ANX 
   for efficient multicast replication. The NAS sends a single copy of 
   the multicast stream towards the ANX. The NAS can perform network-
   based conditional access and multicast admission control on multicast 
   joins, and create replication state in the ANX if the request is 
   admitted by the NAS. 

   The following sections describe various use cases related to 
   multicast.     

    

6.1 Multicast Conditional Access 

    In a Broadband FTTP access scenario, Service Providers may want to 
    dynamically control, at the network level, access to some multicast 
    flows on a per user basis. This may be used in order to 
    differentiate among multiple Service Offers or to realize/reinforce 
 
 
Bitar-Wadhwa            Expires August 07, 2010                [Page 12]

    conditional access based on customer subscription. Note that, in 
    some environments, application layer conditional access by means of 
    Digital Rights Management (DRM) for instance may provide sufficient 
    control, so that network-based Multicast conditional access may not 
    be needed. However, network level access control may add to the 
    service security by preventing the subscriber from receiving a non-
    subscribed channel. In addition, it enhances network security by 
    preventing a multicast stream from being sent on a link or a PON 
    based on a non-subscriber request.   
 
    Where network-based channel conditional access is desired, there are 
    two approaches. It can be done on the NAS along with bandwidth based 
    admission control. The NAS can control the replication state on the 
    ANX based on the outcome of access and bandwidth based admission 
    control. This is covered later in section 3.4. The other approach is 
    to provision the necessary conditional access information on the ANX 
    (ONT and/or OLT) so the ANX can perform the conditional access 
    decisions autonomously.  For these cases, the NAS can use ANCP to 
    provision black and white lists as defined in [ANCP-FRAMEWORK], on 
    the ANX so that the ANX can decide locally to honor a join or not.  
    It should be noted that in the PON case, the ANX is composed of the 
    ONT and OLT. Thus, this information can be programmed on the ONT 
    and/or OLT. Programming this information on the ONT prevents 
    illegitimate joins from propagating further into the network. A 
    third approach, outside of the scope, may be to program the HGW with 
    the access list. 
   
    A White list associated with an Access Port identifies the multicast  
    channels that are allowed to be replicated to that port.  A Black 
list  
    associated with an Access Port identifies the multicast channels 
that  
    are not allowed to be replicated to that port. It should be noted  
    that the black list if not explicitly programmed is the complement  
    of the white list and vice versa. 
 
    If the ONT performs IGMP snooping and it is programmed with a 
    channel access list, the ONT will first check if the requested 
    multicast channel is part of a White list or a Black list associated 
    with the access port on which the IGMP join is received. If the 
    channel is part of a White list, the ONT will pass the join request 
    upstream towards the NAS. The ONT must not start replicating the 
    associated multicast stream to the access port if such a stream is 
    received until it gets confirmation that it can do so from the 
    upstream node (NAS or OLT). Passing the channel access list is one 
    of the admission control criteria whereas bandwidth-based admission 
    control is another. If the channel is part of a Black list, the ONT 


 
 
Bitar-Wadhwa            Expires August 07, 2010                [Page 13] 
    
Internet-Draft            draft-bitar-wadhwa-ancp-pon-03    March 2010 
    




    can autonomously discard the message because the channel is not 
    authorized for that subscriber.  
 
    The ONT, in addition to forwarding the IGMP join, sends an ANCP 
    admission request to the OLT identifying the channel to be joined 
    and the premise. Premise identification to the OLT can be based on a 
    Customer-Port-ID that maps to the access port on the ONT and known 
    at the ONT and OLT. If the ONT has a white list and/or a black list 
    per premise, the OLT need not have such a list. If the ONT does not 
    have such a list, the OLT may be programmed with such a list for 
    each premise. In this latter case, the OLT would perform the actions 
    described earlier on the ONT. Once the outcome of admission control 
    (conditional access and bandwidth based admission control) is 
    determined by the OLT (either by interacting with the NAS or 
    locally), it is informed to the ONT. OLT Bandwidth based admission 
    control scenarios are defined in section 3.4.  
 
   The White List and Black List can contain entries allowing: 
 
   o  An exact match for a (*,G) ASM group (e.g. <G=g.h.i.l>); 
 
   o  An exact match for a (S,G) SSM channel (e.g. 
      <S=s.t.u.v,G=g.h.i.l>); 
 
   o  A mask-based range match for a (*,G) ASM group (e.g. <G=g.h.i.l/ 
      Mask>); 
 
   o A mask-based range match for a (S,G) SSM channel (e.g. 
     <S=s.t.u.v,G=g.h.i.l/Mask>); 
 
   The use of a White list and Black list may be applicable, for 
   instance, to regular IPTV services (i.e.  Broadcast TV) offered by an 
   Access Provider to broadband (e.g., FTTP) subscribers.  For this 
   application, the IPTV subscription is typically bound to a specific 
   FTTP home, and the multicast channels that are part of the 
   subscription are well-known beforehand.  Furthermore, changes to the 
   conditional access information are infrequent, since they are bound 
   to the subscription.  Hence the ANX can be provisioned with the 
   conditional access information related to the IPTV service. 

    
   Instead of including the channel list(s) at the ONT, the OLT or NAS 
   can be programmed with these access lists. Having these access lists 
   on the ONT prevents forwarding of unauthorized joins to the OLT or 
   NAS, reducing unnecessary control load on these network elements. 
   Similarly, performing the access control at the OLT instead of the 
   NAS, if not performed on the ONT, will reduce unnecessary control 
   load on the NAS.

6.2 Multicast Admission Control 

   The successful delivery of Triple Play Broadband services is quickly 
   becoming a big capacity planning challenge for most of the Service   
   Providers nowadays. Solely increasing available bandwidth is not   
   always practical, cost-economical and/or sufficient to satisfy end-
   user experience given not only the strict QoS requirements of unicast   
   applications like VoIP and Video on Demand, but also the fast growth 
   of multicast interactive applications such as "video conferencing", 
   digital TV, and digital audio.  These applications typically require 
   low delay, low jitter, low packet loss and high bandwidth. These 
   applications are also typically "non-elastic", which means that they 
   operate at a fixed bandwidth, which cannot be dynamically adjusted to 
   the currently available bandwidth. 

   An Admission Control (AC) mechanism covering admission of multicast 
   traffic for the FTTP access is required, in order to avoid over-
   subscribing the available bandwidth and negatively impacting the end-
   user experience. Before honoring a user request to join a new 
   multicast flow, the combination of ANX and NAS MUST ensure admission 
   control is performed to validate that there is enough video bandwidth 
   remaining on the PON, and on the uplink between the OLT and NAS to 
   carry the new flow (in addition to all other existing multicast and 
   unicast video traffic) and that there is enough video bandwidth for 
   the subscriber to carry that flow. The solution needs to cope with 
   multiple flows per premise and needs to allow bandwidth to be 
   dynamically shared across multicast and unicast video traffic per 
   subscriber, PON, and uplink (irrespective of whether unicast AC is 
   performed by the NAS, or by some off-path Policy Server). It should 
   be noted that the shared bandwidth between multicast and unicast 
   video is under operator control. That is, in addition to the shared 
   bandwidth, some video bandwidth could be dedicated to Video on 
   Demand, while other video bandwidth could be dedicated for multicast. 
   The focus in this document will be on multicast-allocated bandwidth 
   including the shared unicast and multicast bandwidth.  Thus, 
   supporting admission control requires some form of synchronization 
   between the entities performing multicast AC (e.g. the ANX and/or 
   NAS), the entity performing unicast AC (e.g. the NAS or a Policy 
   Server), and the entity actually enforcing the multicast replication   
   (i.e., the NAS and the ANX).  This synchronization can be achieved in 
   a number of ways: 

  . -  One approach is for the NAS to perform bandwidth based 
     admission control on all multicast video traffic and unicast video 
     traffic that requires using the shared bandwidth with multicast 
     shr. Based on the outcome of admission control, NAS then controls 
     the replication state on the ANX. 
   
     The subscriber generates an IGMP join for the desired stream on its 
     logical connection to the NAS. The NAS terminates the IGMP message, 
     performs conditional access, and bandwidth based admission control 
     on the IGMP request. The bandwidth admission control is performed 
     against the following:

     1. Available video bandwidth on the link to OLT 

     2. Available video bandwidth on the PON interface 

     3. Available video bandwidth on the last mile (access-port on the 
        ONT/ONU).  

     The NAS can locally maintain and track video bandwidth it manages 
     for all the three levels mentioned above. The NAS can maintain 
     identifiers corresponding to the PON interface and the last mile 
     (customer interface). It also maintains a channel map, associating 
     every channel (or a group of channels sharing the same bandwidth 
     requirement) with a data rate. For instance, in case of 1:1 VLAN 
     representation of the premise, the outer tag (S-VLAN) could be 
     inserted by the ANX to correspond to the PON interface on the OLT, 
     and the inner-tag could be inserted by the ANX to correspond to the 
     access-line towards the customer. Bandwidth tracking and 
     maintenance for the PON interface and the last-mile could be done 
     on these VLAN identifiers. In case if N:1 representation, the 
     single VLAN inserted by ANX could correspond to the PON interface 
     on the OLT. The access loop is represented via Customer-Port-ID 
     received in "Agent Circuit Identifier" sub-option in DHCP messages. 

     The NAS can perform bandwidth accounting on received IGMP messages. 
     The video bandwidth is also consumed by any unicast video being 
     delivered to the CPE. NAS can perform video bandwidth accounting 
     and control on both IGMP messages and on requests for unicast video 
     streams when either all unicast admission control is done by the 
     NAS or an external policy server makes a request to the NAS for 
     using shared bandwidth with multicast as described later in the 
     document.  

     This particular scenario assumes the NAS is aware of the bandwidth 
     on the PON, and under all conditions can track the changes in 
     available bandwidth on the PON. On receiving an IGMP Join message, 
     NAS will perform bandwidth check on the subscriber bandwidth. If 
     this passes, and the stream is already being forwarded on the PON 
     by the OLT (which also means that it is already forwarded by the 
     NAS to the OLT), NAS will admit the JOIN, update the available 
     subscriber bandwidth, and transmit an ANCP message to the OLT and 
     in turn to the ONT to start replication on the customer port. If 
     the stream is not already being replicated to the PON by the OLT, 
     the NAS will also check the available bandwidth on the PON, and if 
     it is not already being replicated to the OLT it will check the 
     bandwidth on the link towards the OLT. If this passes, the 
     available PON bandwidth and the bandwidth on the link towards the 
     OLT is updated. The NAS adds the OLT as a leaf to the multicast 
     tree for that stream.  

     On receiving the message to start replication, the OLT will add the 
     PON interface to its replication state if the stream is not already 
     being forwarded on that PON. Also, the OLT will send an ANCP 
     message to direct the ONT to add or update its replication state 
     with the customer port for that channel. The interaction between 
     ANX and NAS is shown in Figures 4 and 5.

     For unicast video streams, application level signaling from the CPE 
     typically triggers an application server to request bandwidth based 
     admission control from a policy server. The policy server can in 
     turn interact with the NAS to request the bandwidth for the unicast 
     video flow if it needs to use shared bandwidth with multicast. If 
     the bandwidth is available, NAS will reserve the bandwidth, update 
     the bandwidth pools for subscriber bandwidth, the PON bandwidth, 
     and the bandwidth on the link towards the OLT, and send a response 
     to the policy server, which is propagated back to the application 
     server to start streaming. Otherwise, the request is rejected.

  . An alternate approach is required if the NAS is not aware of the 
     bandwidth on the PON. In this case the OLT does the PON bandwidth 
     management, and requests NAS to perform bandwidth admission 
     control on subscriber bandwidth and the bandwidth on the link to 
     the OLT. 


     ANX operation: 

     o ONT can snoop IGMP messages. If conditional access is configured 
        and the channel is in the Black list (or it is not on the White 
        list), ONT will drop the IGMP Join. If the channel passes the 
        conditional access check, the ONT will forward the IGMP Join, 
        and will send a bandwidth admission control request to the OLT. 
        In case the multicast stream is already being received on the 
        PON, the ONT does not forward the stream to the access port 
        where IGMP is received, till it has received a positive 
        admission control response from the OLT. 

     o OLT can snoop IGMP messages.  It also receives a bandwidth 
        admission control request from the ONT for the requested 
        channel. It can be programmed with a channel bandwidth map. If 
        the multicast channel is already being streamed on the PON, or 
        the channel bandwidth is less than the multicast available 
        bandwidth on the PON, the OLT forwards the IGMP request to the 
        NAS and keeps track of the subscriber (identified by customer-
        Port-ID) as a receiver. If the channel is not already being 
        streamed on the PON, but the PON has sufficient bandwidth for 
        that channel, the OLT reduces the PON multicast video bandwidth 
        by the channel bandwidth and may optionally add the PON to the 
        multicast tree without activation for that channel. This is 
        biased towards a forward expectation that the request will be 
        accepted at the NAS. The OLT forwards the IGMP join to the NAS. 
        It also sends a bandwidth admission request to the NAS 
        identifying the channel, and the premise for which the request 
        is made. It sets a timer for the subscriber multicast entry 
        within which it expects to receive a request from the NAS that 
        relates to this request.  

        If the PON available bandwidth is less than the bandwidth of the 
        requested channel, the OLT sends an admission response (with a 
        reject) to the ONT, and does not forward the IGMP join to the 
        NAS.  


     NAS operation: 


     The NAS receives the IGMP join from the subscriber on the 
     subscriber connection.  When NAS receives the admission control 
     request from ANX (also signifying the bandwidth on the PON is 
     available), it performs admission control against the subscriber 
     available multicast bandwidth. If this check passes, and the NAS is 
     already transmitting that channel to the OLT, the request is 
     accepted. If the check passes and the NAS is not transmitting the 
     channel to the OLT yet, it performs admission control against the 
     multicast video available bandwidth (this includes the dedicated

     multicast bandwidth and the shared bandwidth between multicast and 
     video on demand) on the link(s) to the OLT. If the check passes, 
     the request is accepted, the available video bandwidth for the 
     subscriber and downlink to the OLT are reduced by the channel 
     bandwidth, and the NAS sends an ANCP admission control response 
     (indicating accept) to the OLT, requesting the addition of the 
     subscriber to the multicast tree for that channel. The OLT 
     activates the corresponding multicast entry if not active and 
     maintains state of the subscriber in the list of receivers for that 
     channel. The OLT also sends an ANCP request to the ONT to enable 
     reception of the multicast channel and forwarding to the subscriber 
     access port. Otherwise, if the request is rejected, the NAS will 
     send an admission reject to the OLT, which in turns removes the 
     subscriber as a receiver for that channel (it it were added), and 
     credits back the channel bandwidth to the PON video bandwidth if 
     there is no other receiver on the PON for that channel. The 
     interactions between ANX and NAS are show in Figures 6 and 7. 

     If the OLT does not receive a response from the NAS within a set 
     timer, the OLT removes the subscriber from the potential list of 
     receivers for the indicated channel. It also returns the allocated 
     bandwidth to the PON available bandwidth if there are no other 
     receivers. In this case, the NAS may send a response to the OLT 
     with no matching entry as the entry has been deleted. The OLT must 
     perform admission control against the PON available bandwidth and 
     may accept the request and send an ANCP request to the ONT to 
     activate the corresponding multicast entry as described earlier. If 
     it does not accept the request, it will respond back to the NAS 
     with a reject. The NAS shall credit back the channel bandwidth to 
     the subscriber. It shall also stop sending the channel to the OLT 
     if that subscriber was the last leaf on the multicast tree towards 
     the OLT.  

     On processing an IGMP leave, the OLT will send an ANCP request to 
     NAS to release resources. NAS will release the subscriber 
     bandwidth. If this leave causes the stream to be no longer required 
     by the OLT, the NAS will update its replication state and release 
     the bandwidth on the NAS to OLT link. 

     If the subscriber makes a request for a unicast video stream (i.e., 
     Video on Demand), it results in appropriate application level 
     signaling, which typically results in an application server 
     requesting a policy server for bandwidth-based admission control 
     for the VoD stream. The policy server after authorizing the 
     request, can send a request to the NAS for the required bandwidth 
     if it needs to use bandwidth that is shared with multicast. This 
     request may be based on a protocol outside of the scope of this 
     document. The NAS checks if the available video bandwidth 
     (accounting for both multicast and unicast) per subscriber and for 
     the link to the OLT is sufficient for the request. If it is, it 
     temporarily reserves the bandwidth and sends an ANCP admission 
     request to the OLT for the subscriber, indicating the desired VoD 
     bandwidth. If the OLT has sufficient bandwidth on the corresponding 
     PON, it reserves that bandwidth and returns an admission response 
     to the NAS. If not, it returns a reject to the NAS. If the NAS

     receives an accept, it returns an accept to the policy server which 
     in turn returns an accept to the application server, and the video 
     stream is streamed to the subscriber. This interaction is shown in 
     Figure 8. If the NAS does not accept the request from the policy 
     server, it returns a reject. If the NAS receives a reject from the 
     OLT, it returns the allocated bandwidth pool to the subscriber and 
     the downlink to the OLT.

  . A third possible approach is where the ANX is assumed to have a 
     full knowledge to make an autonomous decision on admitting or 
     rejecting a multicast and a unicast join. With respect to the 
     interaction between ONT and OLT, the procedure is similar to the 
     first approach (i.e. NAS controlled replication). However, when the 
     OLT receives an IGMP request for a subscriber, it performs 
     admission control against that subscriber multicast video bandwidth 
     (dedicated and shared with Video on Demand), the PON and uplink to 
 
 
Bitar-Wadhwa            Expires August 07, 2010                [Page 25]

     the GWR. It should be noted in this case that if there are multiple 
     NAS-OLT links, either the link on which the multicast stream must 
     be sent is pre-determined, needs to be selected by the OLT based on 
     downstream bandwidth from NAS to OLT and the selection is 
     communicated to the NAS, or the OLT has to be ready to receive the 
     stream on any link. If the check passes, the OLT updates the video 
     available bandwidth per PON and subscriber. The OLT adds the 
     subscriber to the list of receivers and the PON to the multicast 
     tree, if it is not already on it. It also sends an ANCP request to 
     the ONT to add the subscriber access port to that channel multicast 
     tree, and sends an ANCP message to the NAS informing it of the 
     subscriber and link available video bandwidth and the channel the 
     subscriber joined. The NAS upon receiving the ANCP information 
     message, updates the necessary information, including the OLT to 
     the multicast tree if it is not already on it. It should be noted 
     in this case that the ANCP message from the OLT to the NAS is being 
     used to add the OLT to a multicast tree as opposed to an IGMP 
     message. The IGMP message can also be sent by the OLT with the OLT 
     acting as an IGMP proxy at the expense of added messages. In this 
     option, the OLT acts as the network IGMP router for the subscriber. 

    For unicast video streams, the policy server receiving an admission      
    request from an application server, as described before, may query 
    the OLT for admission control as it has all information. If the OLT 
    has sufficient bandwidth for the stream it reserves that bandwidth 
    for the subscriber, PON and OLT uplink to the NAS and returns an 
    accept to the policy server. It also updates the NAS via an ANCP 
    message of the subscriber available video bandwidth. If the OLT 
    rejects the policy server request, it will return a reject to the 
    policy server.  

    It should be noted that if the policy server adjacency is with the   
    NAS, the policy server may make the admission request to the NAS. 
    The NAS then sends an ANCP admission request to the OLT on behalf of 
    the policy server. The NAS returns an accept or reject to the policy 
    server if it gets a reject or accept, respectively, from the OLT. 

     

6.3 Multicast Accounting 

   It may be desirable to perform accurate per-user or per Access Loop 
   time or volume based accounting.  In case the ANX is performing the   
   traffic replication process, it knows when replication of a multicast 
   flow to a particular Access Port or user starts and stops. Multicast 
   accounting can be addressed in two ways: 

     o ANX keeps track of when replication starts or stops, and       
        reports this information to the NAS for further processing. In      
        this case, ANCP can be used to send the information from the ANX 
        to the NAS. This can be done with the Information Report 
        message. The NAS can then generate the appropriate time and/or 
        volume accounting information per Access Loop and per multicast 
        flow, to be sent to the accounting system. The ANCP requirements 
        to support this approach are specified in [ANCP-FRAMEWORK. If

        the replication function is distributed between the OLT and ONT 
        a query from the NAS will result in OLT generating a query to
        the ONT. 

     o ANX keeps track of when replication starts or stops, and      
        generates the time and/or volume based accounting information 
        per Access Loop and per multicast flow, before sending it to a 
        central accounting system for logging. Since ANX communicates 
        with this accounting system directly, the approach does not 
        require the use of ANCP.  It is therefore beyond the scope of 
        this document; 

   It may also be desirable for the NAS to have the capability to   
   asynchronously query the ANX to obtain an instantaneous status report   
   related to multicast flows currently replicated by the ANX. Such a   
   reporting functionality could be useful for troubleshooting and   
   monitoring purposes. If the replication function in the ANX is 
   distributed between the OLT and the ONT, then for some of the 
   information required by the NAS (such as the list of access-ports on 
   which a flow is being forwarded or list of flows being forwarded on 
   an access-port), a query to the OLT from the NAS will result in a 
   query from OLT to ONT. The OLT responds back to the NAS when it 
   receives the response from the ONT. Also, if the list of PONs on 
   which replication is happening for a multicast channel or the list of 
   channels being replicated on a PON is what is desired, the OLT can 
   return this information. 

    

7  Remote Connectivity Check 

   In an end-to-end Ethernet aggregation network, end-to-end Ethernet  
   OAM as specified in IEEE 802.1ag and ITU-T Recommendation Y.1730/1731 
   can provide Access Loop connectivity testing and fault isolation.   
   However, most HGWs do not yet support these standard Ethernet OAM 
   procedures. Also, in a mixed Ethernet and ATM access network (e.g. 
   Ethernet based aggregation upstream from the OLT, and BPON 
   downstream), interworking functions for end-to-end OAM are not yet 
   standardized and widely available. Until such mechanisms become 
   standardized and widely available, Access Node Control mechanism 
   between NAS and ANX can be used to provide a simple mechanism to test 
   connectivity of an access-loop from the NAS. 

   Triggered by a local management interface, the NAS can use the Access 
   Node Control Mechanism (Control Request Message) to initiate an   
   Access Loop test between Access Node and HGW. On reception of the 
   ANCP message, the OLT can trigger native OAM procedures defined for 
   BPON in [G.983.1] and for GPON in [G.984.1]. The Access Node can send 
   the result of the test to the NAS via a Control Response message.

8  Access Topology Discovery 

   In order to avoid congestion in the network, and manage and utilize 
   the network resources better, and ensure subscriber fairness, NAS 
   performs hierarchical shaping and scheduling of the traffic by 
   modeling different congestion points in the network (such as the 
   last-mile, Access Node uplink, and the access facing port). 

   Such mechanisms require that the NAS gains knowledge about the   
   topology of the access network, the various links being used and   
   their respective rates. Some of the information required is somewhat 
   dynamic in nature (e.g.  DSL line rate in case the last mile is xDSL 
   based e.g. in case of "PON fed DSLAMs" for FTTC/FTTN scenarios), 
   hence cannot come from a provisioning and/or inventory management OSS 
   system.  Some of the information varies less frequently (e.g. 
   capacity of the OLT uplink), but nevertheless needs to be kept 
   strictly in sync between the actual capacity of the uplink and the 
   image the NAS has of it. 

   OSS systems are rarely able to enforce in a reliable and scalable    
   manner the consistency of such data, notably across organizational   
   boundaries under certain deployment scenarios.  The Access Topology 
   Discovery function allows the NAS to perform these advanced functions 
   without having to depend on an error-prone and possibly complex 
   integration with an OSS system. 

   The rate of the access-loop can be communicated via ANCP (Information 
   Report Message) from the ONT to the OLT, and from OLT to the NAS. 
   Additionally, during the time the DSL NT is active, data rate changes   
   can occur due to environmental conditions (the DSL Access Loop can   
   get "out of sync" and can retrain to a lower value, or the DSL Access   
   Loop could use Seamless Rate Adaptation making the actual data rate   
   fluctuate while the line is active). In this case, ANX sends an 
   additional Information Report to the NAS each time the Access Loop 
   attributes change above a threshold value. 

    

    

9  Security Considerations 

   [ANCP-SECURITY] lists the ANCP related security threats that could 
   be encountered on the Access Node and the NAS. It develops a threat 
   model for ANCP security, and lists the security functions that are 
   required at the ANCP level. 

   With Multicast handling as described in this document, ANCP protocol   
   activity between the ANX and the NAS is triggered by join/leave   
   requests coming from the end-user equipment.  This could potentially    
   be used for denial of service attack against the ANX and/or the NAS. 

   To mitigate this risk, the NAS and ANX MAY implement control plane 
   protection mechanisms such as limiting the number of multicast flows

   a given user can simultaneously join, or limiting the maximum rate of 
   join/leave from a given user. 

   Protection against invalid or unsubscribed flows can be deployed via 
   provisioning black lists as close to the subscriber as possible (e.g. 
   in the ONT).  

10 Differences in ANCP applicability between DSL and PON 

   As it currently stands, both ANCP framework [ANCP-FRAMEWORK] and 
   protocol [ANCP-PROTOCOL] are defined in context of DSL access. Due to 
   inherent differences between PON and DSL access technologies, ANCP 
   needs a few extensions for supporting the use-cases outlined in this 
   document for PON based access. These specific differences and 
   extensions are outlined below. 

   o In PON, the access-node functionality is split between OLT and ONT. 
   Therefore, ANCP interaction between NAS and AN translates to 
   transactions between NAS and OLT and between OLT and ONT. The 
   processing of ANCP messages (e.g. for multicast replication control) 
   on the OLT can trigger generation of ANCP messages from OLT to ONT. 
   Similarly, ANCP messages from ONT to the OLT can trigger ANCP 
   exchange between the ONT and the NAS (e.g. admission-request 
   messages).This is illustrated in the generic message flow in Figure 3 
   of section 5. In case of DSL, the ANCP exchange is contained between 
   two network elements (NAS and the DSLAM).  

   o The PON connection to the ONT is a shared medium between multiple 
   ONTs on the same PON. The local-loop in case of DSL is point-to-
   point. In case of DSL access network, the access facing port on the 
   NAS (i.e. port to the network between NAS and the DSLAM), and the 
   access-facing ports on the DSLAM (i.e. customer's local-loop) are the 
   two bandwidth constraint points that need to be considered for 
   performing bandwidth based admission control for multicast video and 
   VOD delivered to the customer. In case of PON access, in addition to 
   the bandwidth constraint on the NAS to OLT facing ports, and the 
   subscriber allocated bandwidth for video services, the bandwidth 
   available on the PON for video is an additional constraint that needs 
   to be considered for bandwidth based admission control. If the 
   bandwidth control is centralized in NAS (as described in option 1 of 
   section 6.2), then the NAS needs to support additional logic to 
   consider available PON bandwidth before admitting a multicast request 
   or a VOD request by the user. Accordingly, ANCP needs to identify the 
   customer access port and the PON on which the customer ONT is. If the 
   PON bandwidth control is performed on the OLT (as defined in second 
   option in section 6.2), then additional ANCP request and response 
   messages are required for NAS to query the OLT to determine available 
   PON bandwidth when a request to admit a VOD flow is received on the 
   NAS (as shown in figure 8 in section 6.2) or for the OLT to inform 
   the NAS what stream bandwidth is sent to the subscriber for the NAS 
   to take appropriate action (e.g., bandwidth adjustment for various 
   types of traffic).  

   o In PON, the multicast replication can potentially be performed on 
   three different network elements: (1) on the NAS (2) on the OLT for

   replication to multiple PON ports and (3) on the ONT/ONU for 
   replication to multiple customer ports. In case of DSL, the 
   replication can potentially be performed on NAS and/or the DSLAM. 
   Section 6.2 defines options for multicast replication in case of PON. 
   In the first option, the multicast replication is done on the AN, but 
   is controlled from NAS via ANCP (based on the reception of per-
   customer IGMP messages on the NAS). In this option, the NAS needs to 
   supply to the OLT the set of PON-customer-IDs (as defined in section 
   2.1) to which the multicast stream needs to be replicated. The PON-
   customer-ID identifies the OLT and the PON ports on the OLT as well 
   as the ONT and the access-ports on the ONT where the multicast stream 
   needs to be replicated. Upon receiving the request to update its 
   multicast replication state, the OLT MUST update its replication 
   state with the indicated PON ports, but MAY also need to interact 
   with the ONT via ANCP to update the multicast replication state on 
   the ONT with the set of access-ports (as indicated by the NAS).In 
   case of DSL, the DSLAM only needs to update its own replication state 
   based on the set of access-ports indicated by the NAS. 

   o For reporting purposes, ANCP must enable the NAS to query the OLT 
   for channels replicated on a PON or a list of PONs and to specific 
   access ports. The latter should trigger the OLT to query the ONT for 
   a list of channels being replicated on all access ports or on 
   specific access ports to the premise. In DSL case, it is sufficient 
   to query the DSLAM for a list of channels being replicated on an 
   access port or a list of access ports. 


11 ANCP versus OMCI between the OLT and ONT 

   ONT Management and Control Interface (OMCI) [OMCI] is specified for 
   in-band ONT management via the OLT. This includes configuring 
   parameters on the ONT. Such configuration can include adding an 
   access port on the ONT to a multicast tree and the ONT to a multicast 
   tree. Thus, OMCI can be a potential replacement for ANCP between the 
   OLT and ONT, albeit it may not be suitable protocol for dynamic 
   transactions as required for the multicast application. 

   If OMCI is selected to be enabled between the OLT and ONT to carry 
   the same information elements that would be carried over ANCP, the 
   OLT must perform the necessary translation between ANCP and OMCI for 
   replication control messages received via ANCP. OMCI is an already 
   available control channel, while ANCP requires a TCP/IP stack on the 
   ONT that can be used by an ANCP client and accordingly it requires 
   that the ONT be IP addressable for ANCP. Most ONTs today have a 
   TCP/IP stack used by certain applications (e.g., VoIP, IGMP 
   snooping). ANCP may use the same IP address that is often assigned to 
   SIP or depending on the implementation may require a different 
   address. Sharing the same IP address between SIP and ANCP may have 
   other network implications on traffic routing. Using a separate IP 
   address for the purpose of ONT management or ANCP specifically may 
   often be required when supporting ANCP. These considerations may 
   favor OMCI in certain environments. However, OMCI will not allow 
   some of the transactions required in approach 2, where the ONT sends 
   unsolicited requests to the OLT rather than being queried or 
   configured by OLT requests.

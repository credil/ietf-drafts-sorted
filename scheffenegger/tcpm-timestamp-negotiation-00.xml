    <abstract>
     <t>RFC 1323 defines the TSecr field of a SYN 
     packet to be not valid and thus this field will always be zero. This 
     documents specifies the use of this field to signal and negotiate 
     additional information about the content of the TSopt field as well 
     as the behavior of the receiver.  If the receiver understands this 
     extension, it will use the TSecr field of the SYN/ACK to reply. 
     Otherwise the receiver will ignore the TSecr field and set a 
     timestamp in the TSecr field as specified in RFC 1323.</t>

     <t>The TCP Timestamps Option (TSopt) provides timestamp echoing for
     Round-trip Time (RTT) measurments.  TSopt is widely deployed and
     activated by default in many systems.  RFC 1323 <xref target="RFC1323"/> specifies
     TSopt the following way:</t>

   <t>
   <list style="empty">
     <t>"The Timestamps option carries two four-byte timestamp fields.  The
   Timestamp Value field (TSval) contains the current value of the
   timestamp clock of the TCP sending the option.</t>

   <t>The Timestamp Echo Reply field (TSecr) is only valid if the ACK bit
   is set in the TCP header; if it is valid, it echos a timestamp
   value that was sent by the remote TCP in the TSval field of a
   Timestamps option.  When TSecr is not valid, its value must be zero.
   The TSecr value will generally be from the most recent Timestamp
   option that was received; however, there are exceptions that are
   explained below.</t>

   <t>A TCP may send the Timestamps option (TSopt) in an initial SYN
   segment (i.e., segment containing a SYN bit and no ACK bit), and may
   send a TSopt in other segments only if it received a TSopt in the
   initial SYN segment for the connection."</t>
   </list>
   </t>

     <t>The comparison of the timestamp in the TSecr field to the current
   time gives an estimation of the RTT.  RFC 1323 <xref target="RFC1323"/> specifies
   various cases when more than one timestamp is available to echo.  The
   proposed solution might not always be the best choice, e.g. when the
   TCP Selective Acknowledgment Option (SACK) is used.  Moreover, more
   and more use cases arise where one-way delay (OWD) measurements are
   needed.  These mechanism misuse usually the TSopt to estimated the
   variation in OWD.  To enable such mechanisms the TSecr field in the
   TCP SYN packet could be used for additional negotiation.</t>

     <t>In order to signal the supported capabilities, the TSecr is overloaded with the
     following flags and fields during the three-way handshake. If optional capabilities

    <t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="4">
    <t hangText="EXO - Extended Options"><vspace />
    Indicated that the sender supports extended
    timestamp options as defined by this document, and MUST be set ("1") by compliant
    implementations.</t>
    <t hangText="RES - Reserved"><vspace />
    Reserved for future use. MUST not be set ("0"). If
    a timestamp option is received with this bit set, the receiver MUST ignore the
    extended options field and react as if the Flags were not set (compatibility mode).</t>
    <t hangText="RNG - Range negotiation"><vspace />
    Indicated that the sender is capable of adjusting
    the timestamp clock rate within the bounds of the two 12 bit fields (see <!-- xref target="12bit"/-->).
    Only the active sender of a TCP session is allowed to offer a range, while the receiver
    MAY choose a rate within these bounds.</t>
    <t hangText="BIA - Exponent Bias"><vspace />
    When set, the 16 and 12 bit floating point exponents
    are presented with a bias of 21 instead of 15. This allows negotiation of extremely
    fine-grained timestamp clock resolutions, for example in hardware implementations and
    high speed (>10 Gigabit/s) environments. See section <!-- xref target="float"/--> for more details.</t>
    <t hangText="MIR - Always Mirror Timestamp"><vspace />
    To disambiguate segements and aid timing
    calculations even during loss episodes, the timestamp will always be mirrored regardless
    of the state of the receiver. A sender SHOULD use this option only in conjunction with
    Selective Acknowledgements (SACK <xref target="RFC2018"/>).</t>
    <t hangText="MSK - Mask Timestamps"><vspace />
    If the timestamp is used for congestion control
    purposes, an incentive exists for malicious receivers to reflect tampered timestamps.
    A sender MAY choose to protect timestamps from such modifications by including a fingerprint
    (secure hash of some kind) in some of the least significant bits. However, doing so
    would prevent a receiver from using the timestamp for other purposes. The MASK field
    indicates how many least significant nibbles should be excluded by the receiver, when
    processing a timestamp. Note that this does not impact the reflected timestamp in
    any way - TSecr will always be equal to a appropriate TSval. Another use case would be
    when the sender does not support a timestamp clock which can guarantee unique timestamps
    for retransmitted segments. For unambigously identifying regular from retransmitted
    segments, the timestamp must be unique for otherwise identical segments. Reserving
    the lowest nibble for this purpose allows senders with slow running timestamp clocks
    to make use of this feature.</t>
    <t hangText="S - binary16 Sign"><vspace />
    This is the sign bit of the IEEE 754-2008 binary16 floating
    point representation of the timestamp clock. Timestamp clocks MUST be positive, thus this
    bit MUST be zero.</t>
    <t hangText="EXP16 - binary16 Exponent"><vspace />
    The exponent component of a binary16 floating point
    number indicating the timestamp clock. When BIA is not set, the exponent bias is 15 (identical
    to the binary16 definition in IEEE 754-2008). If OFF is set, the exponent bias is 21, allowing
    faster timestamp clock rates. Subnormal numbers (lower precision), where the exponent is zero,
    extend the range to 2^-24 and 2^-30 respectively. Infinity and NaN (all exponent bits set) MUST
    NOT be invalid, and a timestamp option with NaN/Infinity SHOULD be ignored.</t> 
    <t hangText="FRAC16 - binary16 Fraction"><vspace />
    The fraction component of a binary16 floating point
    number indicating the timestamp clock. The clock rate is measured in seconds between ticks. 
    The least significant bit corresponds therefore to a time interval of 59.6 ns with the default 
    bias of 15, and 0.931 ns with bias set to 21. The longest time interval would be 65504 sec 
    with default bias, and 511.75 sec with bias set to 21.</t>
    <t hangText="EXP12hi">and</t>
    <t hangText="EXP12lo - binary12 Exponent"><vspace />
    The exponent component of a truncated, 12 bit floating point number
    indicating the possible timestamp clock ranges. Only the host initiating a TCP session MAY
    offer a timestamp clock range, while the receiver SHOULD select a timestamp clock within these
    bounds. If the receiver can not adjust it's timestamp clock to match the range, it MAY use
    a timestamp clock rate outside these bounds. If the receiver indicated a timestamp clock
    rate within the indicated bounds, the sender MUST set it's timestamp clock rate to the 
    negotiated rate. If the receiver uses a timestamp clock rate outside the indicated bounds,
    it MUST NOT use timestamps where knowledge of the timestamp clock rate is required (ie. 
    congesion control). The exponent bias is 15 when BIA is not set, and 21 otherwise.</t>
    <t hangText="FRAC12hi">and</t>
    <t hangText="FRAC12lo - binary12 Fraction"><vspace />
    The fraction component of a 12 bit floating point number. Subnormal
    numbers are allowed, while Inifinity/NaN MUST NOT be used. Timestamp options with Infinity/NaN 
    values SHOULD be ignored. The smallest representable value is 238 ns with default bias, and 
    3.73 ns with bias set to 21, while the largest values would be virtually identical to the 
    16 bit floating point values (65024 and 508 sec). </t>

    <section title="Discussion">
     <t>One-way delay (variation) based congestion controls would benefit from knowing 
     the clock resolution on both sides.</t> 
     <t>RTT variance during loss episodes is not deeply researched. Current heuristics 
     (RFC1122, RFC1323, Karn's algorithm, RFC2988) explicitly exclude (and prevent) the use of 
     RTT samples when loss occurs. However, solving the retransmission ambiguity problem -
     and the related reliable ACK delivery problem - may allow the refinement of these 
     algorithms further, as well as enabling new research to distinguish between corruption 
     loss (without RTT / one-way delay impact) and congestion loss (with RTT / one-way delay 
     impact). Research into this field appears to be a rather neglected, especially when it 
     comes to large scale, public internet investigations. Due to the very nature of this, 
     passive investigations without signals contained within the headers are only of limited 
     use in empirical research.</t>
     <t>Retransmission ambiguity detection during loss recovery would allow an additional 
     level of loss recovery control without reverting to timer-based methods. As with the 
     deployment of SACK, separating "what" to send from "when" to send it could be driven 
     one step further. In particular, less conservative loss recovery schemes which do not 
     trade principles of packet conservation against timeliness, require a reliable way of 
     prompt and best possible feedback from the receiver about any delivered segment and 
     their ordering. SACK alone goes quite a long way, but using Timestamp information in 
     addition could remove any ambiguity. However, the current specs in RFC1323 make that 
     use impossible, thus a modified signaling (receiver behavior) is a necessity.</t>

     <t>RFC 1323 defines the TSecr field of a SYN 
     packet to be not valid and thus this field will always be zero. This 
     documents specifies the use of this field to signal and negotiate 
     additional information about the content of the TSopt field as well 
     as the behavior of the receiver.  If the receiver understands this 
     extension, it will use the TSecr field of the SYN/ACK to reply. 
     Otherwise the receiver will ignore the TSecr field and set a 
     timestamp in the TSecr field as specified in RFC 1323.</t>

     <t>The TCP Timestamps Option (TSopt) provides timestamp echoing for
     Round-trip Time (RTT) measurments.  TSopt is widely deployed and
     activated by default in many systems.  RFC 1323 <xref target="RFC1323"/> specifies
     TSopt the following way:</t>

   <t>
   <list style="empty">
     <t>"The Timestamps option carries two four-byte timestamp fields.  The
   Timestamp Value field (TSval) contains the current value of the
   timestamp clock of the TCP sending the option.</t>

   <t>The Timestamp Echo Reply field (TSecr) is only valid if the ACK bit
   is set in the TCP header; if it is valid, it echos a timestamp
   value that was sent by the remote TCP in the TSval field of a
   Timestamps option.  When TSecr is not valid, its value must be zero.
   The TSecr value will generally be from the most recent Timestamp
   option that was received; however, there are exceptions that are
   explained below.</t>

   <t>A TCP may send the Timestamps option (TSopt) in an initial SYN
   segment (i.e., segment containing a SYN bit and no ACK bit), and may
   send a TSopt in other segments only if it received a TSopt in the
   initial SYN segment for the connection."</t>
   </list>
   </t>

     <t>The comparison of the timestamp in the TSecr field to the current
   time gives an estimation of the RTT.  RFC 1323 <xref target="RFC1323"/> specifies
   various cases when more than one timestamp is available to echo.  The
   proposed solution might not always be the best choice, e.g. when the
   TCP Selective Acknowledgment Option (SACK) is used.  Moreover, more
   and more use cases arise where one-way delay (OWD) measurements are
   needed.  These mechanism misuse usually the TSopt to estimated the
   variation in OWD.  To enable such mechanisms the TSecr field in the
   TCP SYN packet could be used for additional negotiation.</t>

    <section title="Overview">
     <t>Enhancements in the area of TCP congestion control can use the measurement
     of the one-way delay variance as one input. However, without explicit 
     knowledge of the partner's timestamp clock, arriving at a good estimate requires
     multiple segent exchanges over a few round trip times. Nevertheless, any such calculation
     has to make assumptions about the network state at the time of the measurement.
     In order to assist such algorithms, explicit knowledge at a early phase of the
     session can be negotiated.</t>
     <t>In addition, by using synergistic signalling between Timestamps and other options
     such as selective acknowledgment, enhancments in loss recovery are possible by 
     removing any retransmission ambiguity . However, currently receivers are required
     to only reflect the timestamp of the last segment that was received in order. 
     Therefore, a backwards compatible way of changing this behavior is required.</t>
     <t>Furthermore, as the importance of the timestamp option increases by using it
     in more aspects of a TCP senders algorithm, so increases the importance of
     maintaining the integrity of the reflected timestamps, while allowing the
     receiver to make use of a senders timestamp.</t>
     <t>As an optional extension, a timestamp clock rate range negotiation is also
     introduced. However, this is only included as example of further possible enhancements.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Definitions">
     <t>The reader is expected to be familiar with the definitions given in 
     <xref target="RFC1323"/>.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Signaling">
     <t>During the initial TCP three-way handshake, timestamp options are negotiated
     using the TSecr field. A compliant TCP receiver will XOR the flags with the received
     TSval, when responding with the SYN+ACK. Timestamp Options MAY only be present when
     the SYN bit is set.</t>
    
     <section title="Capability Flags">
     <t>In order to signal the supported capabilities, the TSecr is overloaded with the
     following flags and fields during the three-way handshake. If optional capabilities
     such as tcp clock range are presented, minimal state will be required in the 
     host to decode the returned Flags xor'ed with the TSval.</t>

    <t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="4">
    <t hangText="EXO - Extended Options"><vspace />
    Indicated that the sender supports extended
    timestamp options as defined by this document, and MUST be set ("1") by compliant
    implementations.</t>
    <t hangText="RES - Reserved"><vspace />
    Reserved for future use. MUST not be set ("0"). If
    a timestamp option is received with this bit set, the receiver MUST ignore the
    extended options field and react as if the Flags were not set (compatibility mode).</t>
    <t hangText="MASK - Mask Timestamps"><vspace />
    If the timestamp is used for congestion control
    purposes, an incentive exists for malicious receivers to reflect tampered timestamps.
    A sender MAY choose to protect timestamps from such modifications by including a fingerprint
    (secure hash of some kind) in some of the least significant bits. However, doing so
    would prevent a receiver from using the timestamp for other purposes. The MASK field
    indicates how many least significant bits should be excluded by the receiver, when
    processing a timestamp for timing purposes. Note that this does not impact the reflected timestamp in
    any way - TSecr will always be equal to an appropriate TSval. Another use case would be
    when the sender does not support a timestamp clock which can guarantee unique timestamps
    for retransmitted segments. For unambigously identifying regular from retransmitted
    segments, the timestamp must be unique for otherwise identical segments. Reserving
    the least significant bits for this purpose allows senders with slow running timestamp clocks
    to make use of this feature. Note that the use of this option as implications in the protection
    against wraped sequence numbers (PAWS - <xref target="RFC1323"/>), as the more bits are 
    set aside for tamper prevention, the faster the timestamp number space cycles itself.</t>
    <t hangText="SGN - binary16 Sign"><vspace />
    This is the sign bit of the IEEE 754-2008 binary16 floating
    point representation of the timestamp clock. Timestamp clocks MUST be positive, thus this
    bit MUST be zero.</t>
    <t hangText="EXP16 - binary16 Exponent"><vspace />
    The exponent component of a binary16 floating point
    number indicating the timestamp clock. The exponent bias is 28, which is not identical
    to the binary16 definition in IEEE 754-2008. Subnormal numbers (lower precision), where the 
    exponent is set to zero, extend the lowest possible value representation to 2^-38 (or 7.276 ps) at
    reduced precision.
    Infinity and NaN (all exponent bits set) are not suppored, an exponent value of 31 is to be treated
    as normal exponent. This allows timestamp clock rates of up to 15.999 sec.</t> 
    <t hangText="FRAC16 - binary16 Fraction"><vspace />
    The fraction component of a binary16 floating point
    number indicating the timestamp clock. The clock rate is measured in seconds between ticks. 
    The range with the highest resolution, excluding subnormal numbers, covers clock ranges between
    7.45 ns and 15.99 sec. It is expected, that timestamp clock rates in excess of 0.1 ms are 
    implemented by inserting the timestamp "late" before transmitting a segment.</t>
    </list>
    </t>
    <t>Example for an extended timestamp option, to indicate that the senders timestamp clock (tcp clock)
    is running with 1 ms per tick:</t>
       <t>SYN, TSopt=&lt;X&gt;, TSecr=EXO|MASK|EXP16=18|FRAC16=0x018 </t>
       <t>The clock rate calculates as 2^(18-28)*1.0000011b, thus indicates an actual clock rate of 999.45 us</t>
   
    </section>
    
    <section title="Implicit extended negotiation">
      <t>If both timestamp extended options and selective acknowledgement options 
      (<xref target="RFC2018"/>) are negotiated, both hosts MUST mirror the 
      timestamp option immediately after receiving it. Note that this is in conflict with
      <xref target="RFC1323"/>, where only the timestamp of the last segment received in
      sequence is mirrored. As SACK allows discrimination of reordered or lost segments,
      the reflected timestamps are not required to convey the most conservative
      information. If SACK indicates lost or reordered packets at the receiver, the 
      sender MUST take appropriate action such as ignoring the received timestamps
      for calculating the round trip time, or assuming a delayed packet (with appropriate
      handling). The exact implications are beyond the scope of this note.</t>
      <t>This allows the synergistic use of the timestamp option with the SACK option 
      to improve loss recovery, round trip time and one way delay variance measurements 
      even during loss or reordering episodes. This is enabled by removing any retransmission 
      ambiguity using unique timestamps for every retransmission, while simultaneously
      the SACK option indicates the ordering of received segments even in the presence of
      ACK loss or reordering.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    </section>
     
    <section title="Discussion">
     <t>One-way delay (variation) based congestion controls would benefit from knowing 
     the clock resolution on both sides.</t> 
     <t>RTT variance during loss episodes is not deeply researched. Current heuristics 
     (RFC1122, RFC1323, Karn's algorithm, RFC2988) explicitly exclude (and prevent) the use of 
     RTT samples when loss occurs. However, solving the retransmission ambiguity problem -
     and the related reliable ACK delivery problem - may allow the refinement of these 
     algorithms further, as well as enabling new research to distinguish between corruption 
     loss (without RTT / one-way delay impact) and congestion loss (with RTT / one-way delay 
     impact). Research into this field appears to be a rather neglected, especially when it 
     comes to large scale, public internet investigations. Due to the very nature of this, 
     passive investigations without signals contained within the headers are only of limited 
     use in empirical research.</t>
     <t>Retransmission ambiguity detection during loss recovery would allow an additional 
     level of loss recovery control without reverting to timer-based methods. As with the 
     deployment of SACK, separating "what" to send from "when" to send it could be driven 
     one step further. In particular, less conservative loss recovery schemes which do not 
     trade principles of packet conservation against timeliness, require a reliable way of 
     prompt and best possible feedback from the receiver about any delivered segment and 
     their ordering. SACK alone goes quite a long way, but using Timestamp information in 
     addition could remove any ambiguity. However, the current specs in RFC1323 make that 
     use impossible, thus a modified signaling (receiver behavior) is a necessity.</t>

      and the timestamp clock resolution should be more towards one or the other. Also,
      if certain algorithms want to have identical timestamp clock rates both at the
      sender and receiver, negotiating the clock rate would be preferrable. However, 
      without a full three way handshake, full negotiation of the timestamp clock rate
      is not possible.</t>
      <t>For this purpose, the following extension of this proposal is suggested.</t>

    <t>The following additonal fields are defined:
    <list style="hanging" hangIndent="4">
    <t hangText="RNG - Range negotiation"><vspace />
    Indicated that the sender is capable of adjusting
    the timestamp clock rate within the bounds of the two 12 bit fields (see <xref target="12bit"/>).
    This flag is only valid in the initial SYN segment, and invalid when the ACK bit is set.</t>
    <t hangText="EXP12lo">and</t>
    <t hangText="EXP12hi - binary12 Exponent"><vspace />
    The exponent component of a truncated, 12 bit floating point number
    indicating the possible timestamp clock ranges. The exponent bias is also 28, and no special
    numbers (infinity, NaN) are allowed. The exponent value 31 is treated like any other exponent
    value. Only the host initiating a TCP session MAY
    offer a timestamp clock range, while the receiver SHOULD select a timestamp clock within these
    bounds. If the receiver can not adjust it's timestamp clock to match the range, it MAY use
    a timestamp clock rate outside these bounds. If the receiver indicated a timestamp clock
    rate within the indicated bounds, the sender MUST set it's timestamp clock rate to the 
    negotiated rate. If the receiver uses a timestamp clock rate outside the indicated bounds,
    the sender MUST set the local timestamp clock rate to the value indicated at the closer
    bound. </t>
    <t hangText="FRAC12lo">and</t>
    <t hangText="FRAC12hi - binary12 Fraction"><vspace />
    The fraction component of a 12 bit floating point number. Subnormal
    numbers are allowed (Exponent value 0). This allows a range between 7.45 ns and 15.99 s with 
    full resolution (lower bound is 0.06 ns using subnormal values). </t>

    <section title="Range Negotiation" anchor="12bit">
      <t>The following sequence would negotiate the timestamp clock rate for both sender and
      receiver, where both finally know the clock rate of the respective partner.</t>
      <t>SYN, TSopt=&lt;X&gt;, TSecr=EXO|RNG|MASK|12bit-lo=1ms|12bit-hi=100ms </t>
      <t>SYN,ACK, TSopt=&lt;Y&gt;, TSecr=&lt;X&gt;^EXO|MASK|16bit=10ms</t>
      <t>In this example, both hosts would run their respective timestamp clocks with a resolution
      of 10 ms.</t>
      <t>SYN, TSopt=&lt;X&gt;, TSecr=EXO|RNG|MASK|12bit-lo=1ms|12bit-hi=100ms </t>
      <t>SYN,ACK, TSopt=&lt;Y&gt;, TSecr=&lt;X&gt;^EXO|MASK|16bit=1000ms</t>
      <t>In this example, the sender would run the timestamp clocks with a resolution
      of 100 ms (closer to the receivers clock rate of 1 sec), while the receiver will
      have a timestamp clock rate running at 1 sec.</t>

      <t>SYN,ACK, TSopt=&lt;Y&gt;, TSecr=&lt;X&gt;^EXO|MASK|16bit=100us</t>
      <t>In this example, the sender would run the timestamp clocks with a resolution
      of 10 ms (closer to the receivers clock rate of 0.1 ms), while the receiver will
      have a timestamp clock rate running at 0.1ms.</t>

Abstract
 
   The intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track as an
   Informational RFC.
 
   The EDIINT [AS1], [AS2] and [AS3] message formats do not currently
   contain any provisions for preservation of the filename of a
   transmitted EDI business document from one Trading Partner to
   another.

INTERNET DRAFT  Filename Preservation for EDIINT Protocol  October 2010

   However,within certain trading communities, it is not uncommon for
   Trading Partners to require a specific filenames for EDI business
   documents to trigger specific backend processing. So it is
   the goal of this informational document to outline the procedures
   and mechanisms required to preserve filenames of EDI business
   documents.

 
1. Introduction
 
   This document describes a method of filename preservation utilizing
   the Content-Disposition MIME header[RFC 2183]. This document will
   further define the use of available optional parameters as described
   in RFC 2183, and any issues involved with implementing this
   informational document.
   
2. Requirements
   
   An EDIINT compliant system that implements this informational 
   document MUST preserve the filename of an EDI business document 
   during packaging and transport of the EDIINT MIME message to its
   trading partner.

   The recipient of the EDIINT MIME message MUST be able to retrieve the
   filename of the MIME wrapped EDI business document and transfer the
   received file to its backend system using the received filename.

   Since there are many ways in which files can be delivered to an
   EDIINT compliant application from their backend, this document will
   only focus on preserving the filename within the EDIINT MIME message.
   Each vendor will decide on their own how the filename is preserved
   within their application and tied to a specific EDI business
   document. It is only important that the filename of an EDI business
   document is the same filename name that is linked to the EDI document
   within the EDIINT MIME message.

   The linking of a filename to an EDI business document within an
   EDIINT MIME message will be accomplished by the use of the 
   Content-Disposition MIME header.

   The Content-Disposition header will be added to the MIME bodypart
   that encapsulates the EDI business document.  If the EDIINT MIME
   message contains multiple attachments( See [MA] ) then each
   individual MIME bodypart that encapsulates an attachment will have
   its own Content-Disposition header describing the filename of the
   attachment.

   There may be times when EDI business documents are received from
   backend systems where no filename is linked to the outbound EDI
   business document or when filename preservation is not required.
   During these times, the sending system may internally generate a
   filename for the EDI business document.

INTERNET DRAFT  Filename Preservation for EDIINT Protocol  October 2010


   Any receiving system that receives an attachment where no
   Content-Disposition header exists MAY create its own filename for the
   attachment when it is transferred to the backend system.

   If the trading partner agreement between two trading partners
   requires filename preservation, the EDIINT application MUST ensure
   that a mechanism is available to receive files from their backend
   system that allows linking of filenames to EDI business documents.
   
 
2.1 Content-Disposition Header

   The format of the Content-Disposition header is defined in
   [RFC 2183], Section 2,  and was copied to this document for the
   convenience of the reader. If there are any discrepancies between
   this document and [RFC 2183], [RFC 2183] will be considered correct.

   In the extended BNF notation of [RFC 5322], the Content-Disposition
   header field is defined as follows:

     disposition := "Content-Disposition" ":"
                    disposition-type
                    *(";" disposition-parm)

     disposition-type := "inline"
                       / "attachment"
                       / extension-token
                       ; values are not case-sensitive

     disposition-parm := filename-parm
                       / creation-date-parm
                       / modification-date-parm
                       / read-date-parm
                       / size-parm
                       / parameter

     filename-parm := "filename" "=" value

     creation-date-parm := "creation-date" "=" quoted-date-time

     modification-date-parm := "modification-date" "=" quoted-date-time

     read-date-parm := "read-date" "=" quoted-date-time

     size-parm := "size" "=" 1*DIGIT

     quoted-date-time := quoted-string
                      ; contents MUST be an RFC 5322 `date-time'
                      ; numeric timezones (+HHMM or -HHMM) MUST be used

   NOTE ON PARAMETER VALUE LENGTHS: A short (length <= 78 characters)

INTERNET DRAFT  Filename Preservation for EDIINT Protocol  October 2010

   parameter value containing only non-`tspecials' characters SHOULD be
   represented as a single `token'.  A short parameter value containing
   only ASCII characters, but including `tspecials' characters, SHOULD
   be represented as `quoted-string'.  
   `Extension-token', `parameter', `tspecials' and `value' are defined
   according to [RFC 2045] (which references [RFC 5322] in the 
   definition of some of these tokens).  `quoted-string' and `DIGIT' 
   are defined in [RFC 5322].


   Example:  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="myfile"

   Systems compliant with this informational document SHOULD use the
   "attachment" disposition-type and MUST use the "filename"
   disposition-parm.  Systems MAY also choose to use any other
   registered disposition-parms within the Content-Disposition header
   along with the disposition-type and filename parms. Compliant systems
   MUST also ignore any disposition-parms it does not recognize when
   parsing the Content-Disposition header.

 
2.2 Structure of an EDI MIME bodypart

   The example below shows a MIME bodypart that encapsulates an EDI
   business document. Every MIME bodypart within an EDIINT message that
   contains an EDI business document MUST contain the
   Content-Disposition header.


   Content-Type: application/edi-x12
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=myedifile.x12

3. Filename Parameter

   Rules and restrictions on the use of the filename parameter value are
   outlined in RFC 2183, Section, 2.3 and RFCs 5322, 2045, 2046, 2047,
   2048 and 2049.

3.1 Filenames

Harding                                                        [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT  Filename Preservation for EDIINT Protocol  October 2010


   As stated in RFC 2183, Section 2.3, current MIME standards restrict
   the grammar of filenames and various file systems will have name
   limitations. So it will be the responsibility of the two Trading
   Partners to determine the limits imposed by their trading
   environments.

4. Issues

4.1  RFC 2231

   RFC 2231 states that parameter values longer than 78 characters, or
   which contain non-ASCII characters, MUST be encoded as specified in
   [RFC 2231].
   
   This informational document does not encourage the use of filenames
   longer than 78 characters or comprised of non-ascii characters. See
   Section 3.1.

4.2 AS3(FTP) 
 
   The filename parameter that is described in this document is for the
   embedded EDI business document and does not affect the name of the
   EDIINT message that is uploaded to a trading partner's FTP server.
   EDIINT compliant AS3 applications will follow any guidelines as
   defined by [AS3] for file naming conventions for uploaded files.

5. Security Considerations
 
   See RFC 2183, Section 5
   
6. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

                         ALTO Service Discovery
                  draft-song-alto-server-discovery-03

Abstract

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service aims to provide
   distributed applications with information to perform better-than-
   random initial peer selection when multiple peers in the network are
   available to provide a resource or service.  In order to discover an
   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Server, a set of
   mechanisms are required.  These mechanisms enable applications to
   find an information source which provides them with information
   regarding the underlying network.  This document discusses various
   scenarios of ALTO discovery and specifies the use of several
   available options such as DHCP or DNS.

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                July 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  History

   This document represents a merge of features from two previous
   drafts:

   (1). draft-wang-alto-discovery-00

   (2). draft-song-alto-server-discovery-00

   The ALTO service architecture and protocol are currently under
   discussion and development within the IETF ALTO working group.

   Although it is identified in the charter that a discovery mechanism
   is needed, the preference is to adopt one or more existing mechanisms
   for ALTO discovery rather than designing a new one.  This document is
   consistent with the ALTO framework[I-D.ietf-alto-protocol], and
   presents different scenarios and available options based on prior and
   related discovery mechanisms.  This document will be updated to track
   the progress of the ALTO requirements and solution.

1.2.  Overview

   The ALTO problem statement [RFC5693] describes that in P2P
   applications or client/server applications, resources or services are
   often available through multiple replicas and each of those are
   sometimes provided by different providers.  ALTO service gives
   guidance to a consumer or directory about which resource provider(s)
   to select, in order to optimize the client's performance or quality
   of experience while optimizing resource consumption in the underlying
   network infrastructure.

   In order to query the ALTO server, clients must first know one or
   more ALTO servers that might provide useful information.  The purpose
   of the ALTO discovery mechanism is to find those servers in different
   network and application scenarios.

   Section 3 and Section 4 discuss various scenarios of ALTO service
   deployment and discovery.  Section 5 provides a description of
   available discovery mechanisms and its application to the ALTO
   service discovery use case addressing potential issues and
   consideration for each.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                July 2010


   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The document uses terms defined in [RFC5693].

   In addition to the generic ALTO descriptions, the following terms are
   used to describe the discovery mechanisms in this document:

   o ALTO Discovery Client: The logical entity discovering the ALTO
   Service.  Depending on the scenario, this could be a Peer or a Super-
   peer/Tracker.

   o ALTO Discovery Server: The logical entity providing information to
   locate the ALTO Service.  Depending on the discovery mechanism, this
   could be another Peer or a dedicated entity in the network.

   o ALTO Discovery Domain: The scope of the network handled by a
   particular ALTO Discovery Server.


3.  ALTO Service Deployment

   This section explores the various dimensions of the ALTO service
   deployment and access scenarios, and briefly discusses their
   implications to the discovery mechanisms.  Figure 1 below shows a
   generic ALTO framework diagram with discovery. .

3.1.  ISP-Centric ALTO Service Deployments

   (Haibin: we delete the application-centric ALTO servcie deployment
   scenario as to keep consistent with the ALTO framework in the working
   group)

   An ALTO Server is the logical entity that provides query interfaces
   for ALTO Clients.  ALTO servers are deployed in an ISP-centric
   deployment.

   A network operator which wants to optimize its traffic, e.g. to
   reduce its transit traffic volume across the network boundaries; a
   third party on behalf of one or even several ISPs.

3.2.  Cross-domain vs. Localized ALTO Server Discovery

   For cross domain scenarios, the ALTO client is embeded in the
   application tracker or Resource Directory.

   There may be several ALTO servers distributed in different operator's
   networks.  Each operator may provide the ALTO service using their own
   ALTO servers.  Each network operator may have its own traffic
   optimization policy based on his network topology, however it may not
   know other network operator's policies, nor be clear of other network
   operator's topologies (e.g. topology hiding).  Each of the ALTO
   servers may have a FQDN.

   The ALTO client (e.g. the Tracker) must be able to discover and
   choose the ALTO server that has the information that is specific to
   those clients located within that network.

   In localized discovery deployments one or several ALTO servers
   provide the service only to clients in their own network or
   autonomous system.


4.  ALTO Service Discovery Scenarios

4.1.  Discovery Metrics

4.1.1.  Discovery Clients

   The ALTO Client can be the Peer in the end-user host or an external
   entity like a Super-peer or Resource Directory (aka Tracker) on



Song, et al.            Expires January 13, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                July 2010


   behalf of the Peer [RFC5693].  If a Super-Peer or Tracker acts as an
   ALTO Client it needs to know and select the suitable ALTO Service for
   the Peer being served.  Possible mechanisms for third party ALTO
   discovery have been proposed in[I-D.kiesel-alto-3pdisc]

   In a hybrid model the address info of the ALTO Server could be
   communicated from the Peer to the Super-Peer using the application
   protocol.  It could also be discovered by the Super-Peer from other
   Peer information received implicitly (like the Peer public IP
   address) or received explicitly.

   There could be scenarios where only the Peer (and not the Super-Peer/
   Tracker) is able to access the ALTO Service, for example if the ALTO
   Server is located in a private network.  Also the ALTO server might
   not allow requests from the IP addresses that are out of its
   administrative domain.

4.1.2.  Service Location

   The ALTO service is provided by a centralized entity (the ALTO
   Server) for a given scope.  A centralized ALTO Server is implicitly
   or explicitly assigned to a specific network scope, an out-of-band
   discovery mechanism is often required.

   The ALTO Server for a Peer could be in the same Local Area Network
   (LAN), within the same ISP Network but not on the same LAN, or in the
   Global Internet outside the ISP Network.  Different network scopes
   place different constraints on the discovery mechanisms.  Multicast
   discovery generally works within a single LAN only, whereas DNS-based
   or DHCP-aabased discovery can span multiple subnets within a single
   ISP or a single network administrative domain.  Internet scope
   discovery usually requires cross-domain indexing or directory
   services.  Note that peers participating in a single P2P application
   may reside on the same or different ISP networks.  Scenarios like
   this may require hybrid discovery solutions that can adapt to
   multiple network scopes at the same time.  The discovery mechanisms
   listed in this document should take into account possible limitations
   of the ALTO service deployment in those network scopes.

4.1.3.  Layering Perspective

   The discovery process takes place before the first access to the ALTO
   server.  This discovery process could be done at host network
   initialization time, at application initialization time or just
   before the first ALTO query is sent.

4.2.  Discovery Scenarios

   The ALTO service discovery scenarios are classified into two types:
   one is the ALTO server discovery by end terminals, and the other is
   the ALTO server discovery by application trackers.

4.2.1.  Local ALTO service discovery by end terminals

   In p2p applications without a tracker like DHTs and other
   conventional client/server applications, an end device needs to
   discover the local ALTO server by itself.

   P2P application which has tracker(s) may also embed the ALTO client
   within the peers .  And the peers can do the remote peer selection
   after retrieving peer list from the application tracker.  Or the peer
   can send its ALTO server address information to the application
   tracker, and the application tracker will contact the specific ALTO
   server and do the peer selection for peers.

   After the discovery of an ALTO server, the p2p client can get
   guidance from the ALTO server directly or through its application
   tracker.

4.2.2.  Local ALTO service discovery by application trackers

   Some p2p applications have trackers, and these applications might not
   need to have their clients looking for the ALTO server guidance.
   Trackers query the ALTO servers for guidance, and then return the
   final ranked result to the application clients.  However, application
   clients are distributed among different network operators and
   autonomous systems.  Trackers must find different ALTO servers for
   the clients located in different network operators or autonomous
   systems.

   Figure 4 shows an example for a tracker's ALTO server discovery.  For
   client 1, the tracker has not cached yet the mapping between client
   1's network operator and its ALTO server address, so it queries the
   DNS server for the ALTO server address in that operator's domain.
   And then the tracker interacts with the ALTO server on behalf of
   client 1(to get the network map and cost map), finally, the ranked
   list is sent back to client 1.  For client 2, the tracker has cached
   the mapping between client 2's network operator and its ALTO server
   address, so it does not need to query the DNS for the address of ALTO
   server 2.  If the Application tracker already has the network map and
   cost map from ALTO Server2, then it does not to query the ALTO Server
   for network map and cost map frequently.

5.  ALTO Service Discovery Mechanisms

   One ALTO client should use one or several of the introduced discovery
   mechanisms according to its application scenario until it finally
   finds an appropriate ALTO server.

   The following issues should be considered when designing the ALTO
   service discovery mechanism.

      Load Balance: When more than one ALTO server provide identical
      service for the same area, we must find a mechanism to balance the
      processing load between the ALTO servers;

      Well known port: If ALTO server provides service through a well
      known port, then the discovery mechanism only needs to discover
      the IP address of an ALTO server that can provide service for a
      client, otherwise, the discovery mechanism must discover both IP
      address and port number through which the ALTO server provides the
      service.

         Note:It will depend on the ALTO protocol whether a well know
         port is used for the ALTO server.  If there is no well known
         port for the ALTO server, we need to discover the port
         information with the discovery process.

      IP address change: The IP address of the ALTO server may change in
      some circumstances.  The ALTO service discovery mechanism must be
      well adaptable to this case when necessary.

      Mobile Scenarios: When the end terminals are mobile equipments,
      the data traffic may route via a roaming client's home agent's
      router to the client, or route to the client directly.  Which ALTO
      server to choose should depend on the routing optimization mode
      adopted for mobility.  If the data traffic routes via the client's
      home agent, it should choose the ALTO server that serves its home
      area network, otherwise, it should choose the ALTO server that
      serves its current network.

5.1.  ALTO service discovery using Domain Name System (DNS)

   DNS is widely used on the Internet to discover the server address for
   applications.  ALTO service is a conventional client/server mode
   service, which can use DNS lookup for its service discovery.

   NAPTR [RFC2915] and SRV [RFC2782] DNS resource records are
   appropriate to provide service discovery mechanisms.  The concrete
   application of these resource records depends on the final ALTO
   requests/response protocol.  The use of NAPTR or SRV records is a

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                July 2010


   trade-off between flexibility and simplicity.  S-NAPTR [RFC3958] and
   U-NAPTR [RFC4848] mechanisms provide a Dynamic Delegation Discovery
   System (DDDS) Application to map domain name, service name and
   protocol name to a target host and port or to a target URI.  SRV
   records provide a mechanism to map domain name, service name and
   transport protocol name to a target host and port.  The use of a
   NAPTR or SRV solution is open to discussion and depends on the
   requirements of the ALTO protocol.  Next section will asume the use
   of SRV records.

5.1.1.  DNS-based ALTO discovery

   Figure 5. shows a general DNS ALTO server discovery mechanism.  A
   server must register its SRV resource record with a well known
   service name (e.g. _ALTO._TCP.example.com) in the DNS system.  The
   service name in this document refers to the name used for DNS SRV
   query, which includes the service label, protocol name (TCP or UDP)
   and domain name.  Any ALTO client that wants to get the IP address
   and port of the ALTO server sends a DNS SRV query to the DNS server
   in that domain .

5.1.2.  Determine Service Name of Local ALTO servers

   An ALTO discovery client must know its ALTO service name for it
   before sending a query to the DNS system.  Some ALTO servers may
   provide service to the overall network, they may have well-known
   service name.  But in most cases, one ALTO server will only provide
   service to its own local access network or autonomous system.  There
   will be multiple ALTO servers in the overall network.  An ALTO
   discovery client needs to find the service name of its local ALTO

   server.

5.1.2.1.  Using DHCP option for access domain name

   There are DHCP options (OPTION_V4_ACCESS_DOMAIN and
   OPTION_V6_ACCESS_DOMAIN) proposed in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery]
   to discover the local access domain names.  The retrieved access
   domain name can be used to form a SRV name by prefixing the ALTO
   service label to the access domain name.  If it failed with the SRV
   lookup with this service name, then it will remove one tag from the
   left hand of the access domain name and prefix the ALTO service label
   to form a new SRV name.  It will iterate the process until it
   succeeds in getting an ATLO server information or failed.

   It should be noticed that there are many residential gateways (RG)
   which can act as DHCP servers themselves.  RG becomes a hindrance
   between the end terminals and the ALTO service provider's DHCP server
   if we use DHCP.  It should not depend on the update of all these RGs
   to support this new DHCP Option for ALTO server discovery.  A DHCP
   Container Option [I-D.ietf-dhc-container-opt] for server
   configuration should be used here.  With the Container Option, the
   DHCP server for the consumer domain (e.g.  RGs) can just pass the
   server configuration to the end terminals without explicit knowledge
   of the DHCP options contained in the Container.  The DHCP Option for
   the access domain name could be contained in the Container Option.

5.1.2.2.  Use IANA Database

   The service name of a client's local ALTO server could be formed by
   adding the service and protocol label before its domain information.
   IANA and its subsidiary organizations (e.g.  APNIC) database can be
   used to lookup the physical domain of a client through its public IP
   address, i.e. which network operator and/or autonomous system the
   client belongs to.  The WHOIS service [WWW.WHOIS] on the Internet is
   also available for this purpose.  This mechanism requires ISPs assign
   the domain names to their ALTO servers according to the AS and ISP
   information (e.g. they have a rule to format the domain name,
   AS.ISP.COM), then you can rebuid the domain name with the information
   retrieved from WHOIS.  Otherwise, you can't.

   However, the mapping information may be changed due to the business
   deals and network adjustment.  For example, an ISP could sell some
   part of its network (include all equipments, IP addresses, AS number,
   and so on) to another ISP, and the ISP does not have the
   responsibility to notify the IANA, and then the information in the
   IANA database is wrong.

5.1.2.3.  Reverse DNS lookup

   BEP 22 [BEP-22] framework uses reverse DNS lookup to determine the
   domain name of a client through its public address.  And then use
   service label and the domain name to lookup the local server in DNS.
   The following limitations should be considered when use this
   mechanism.

   (1) This method assumes that the access network provider also
   provides the reverse DNS record and they control the domain that is
   indicated in the "PTR" record.  (In most cases it is true, but not
   always)

   (2) Furthermore, this method might not apply where a host is given a
   domain name that is different from the domain name of the access
   network.

   (3) In case of NAT and a public ALTO server, it requires the ALTO
   client to know its public IP address.

   The advantage is that it doesn't require any update/configuration/
   change in the DHCP servers of any residential gateway.

5.2.  DHCP

   There are other ways using DHCP to locate an ALTO server.  One
   suggestion is to use DHCP to obtain the ALTO server IP address and
   port information directly.  New DHCP options are needed for this
   purpose.  The residential gateways consideration for DHCP option must
   be considered as described in . (Section 5.1.2.1)

   With this mechanism, the DHCP server needs to support load balance if
   there are more than one ALTO servers for this access domain.  The
   maintenance is costly when the address of ALTO server changes.

5.3.  XRD

   XRD is described in [XEP-1.0].  In order to begin the XRD discovery
   you need the URL (or XRI) of the resource you want to discover links/
   services related to.  In other XRD use cases like OpenId or
   OpenSocial, it is clear that you know that URL (the OpenId url of the
   user, or the url of the OS container).  But in case of ALTO Server
   Discovery, the obtainment of this initial URL also needs to use some
   discovery framework.

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                July 2010


5.4.  Provisioning

   A network operator can simply provide a configuration file that
   contains the ALTO server address for its clients, provided that there
   are only one or a few ALTO servers which provide identical service
   for its network.  An application can also provide such a
   configuration file containing the ALTO server address if an existing
   ALTO server provides identical service to the overall network.

5.5.  Manual Configuration

   Manual configuration of the ALTO service location(s) could work in a
   single ISP network scope, but is not scalable when multiple ISPs or
   cross-domain ALTO services are required.  P2P applications often
   connect peers from ISPs that they may not have contacted before, and
   manual configuration will not work without any prior knowledge of the
   ALTO servers.

5.6.  Multicast and broadcast

   Multicast or broadcast MAY be used in some scenarios for ALTO
   discovery.

   IP-multicast-based discovery generally works in two ways:

   1.  Clients send out multicast discovery requests and listen for
   responses (usually unicast) from available servers or service
   providers.

   2.  Servers or service providers send out multicast announcements
   when they become available or periodically, and clients waits for the
   next available multicast announcement to identify the servers or
   service providers.

   The on-demand requests and periodic announcements are not mutually
   exclusive.  An implementation can choose to utilize both
   simultaneously.  The configuration effort of multicast discovery is
   fairly straightforward, only the multicast address and port are
   needed.  Service types and additional information are often encoded
   in the requests or announcements messages, enabling the same
   multicast channel to support discovery of different resources or
   services.  There are two main constraints of multicast-based
   discovery - scopes and flooding messages.  Routers disable multicast
   forwarding by default, making it practically a single-subnet
   solution.  Some forms of discovery proxies are needed to extend the
   scope of multicast discovery to multiple subnets.  The second issue
   is the flooding of multicast messages to all hosts on the same
   subnet.  The total bandwidth consumed by multicast depends on the



Song, et al.            Expires January 13, 2011               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                July 2010


   arrival rate the client application requests, and/or the frequency of
   the service announcements.  Older generations of 802.11-based
   wireless access points often slow down the transmission of multicast
   messages or generally have a higher packet loss rate for those,
   causing some multicast discovery implementation to automatically re-
   send multicast requests or announcements by default.  This mitigation
   further increases the amount of flooding messages on the LAN.
   Examples of multicast-based discovery include [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-
   multicastdns], [I-D.cai-ssdp-v1], [WSD], SLP [RFC2165], and LLMNR
   [RFC4795].

5.7.  Caching

   Once a client has located an ALTO server for the first time, it can
   cache it for use as future ALTO server.  There are implications in
   case of mobility of devices.


6.  Security Considerations

   As this document mainly proposes to use DNS and DHCP for ALTO service
   discovery, it will depend on the DHCP security and DNS security for
   this service discovery.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The service label for the ALTO service will depend on the final
   protocol name for application-layer traffic optimization(TBD).

    Diameter IKEv2: Support for Interaction between IKEv2 Server and
                            Diameter Server
                draft-cakulev-ikev2-psk-diameter-01.txt

Abstract

   Internet Key Exchange is a component of IPsec used for performing
   mutual authentication as well as establishing and maintaining
   security associations (SAs) between two parties such as a user and a
   network entity.  Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2) protocol allows
   several different mechanisms for authenticating a user, namely the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol, certificates, and pre-shared
   secrets.  To authenticate and/or authorize the user, the network
   element such as the Access Gateway may need to dynamically bootstrap
   a security association based on interaction with the Diameter server.
   This document specifies the interaction between the Access Gateway
   and Diameter server for the IKEv2 based on pre-shared secrets.

Internet-Draft               Diameter IKEv2                December 2009


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4306] defines IKEv2 as a protocol that performs mutual
   authentication between two parties and establishes a security
   association (SA) that includes shared secret information that can be
   used to efficiently establish SAs for Encapsulating Security Payload
   (ESP) [RFC4303] and/or Authentication Header (AH) [RFC4302], and a
   set of cryptographic algorithms to be used by the SAs to protect the
   traffic that they carry.  IKEv2 protocol allows several different
   mechanisms for authenticating a IKEv2 Peer to be used, such as the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol, certificates, and pre-shared
   secrets.

   From a service provider perspective it is important to ensure that a
   user is authorized to use the services.  Therefore, the IKEv2 Server
   must verify that the IKEv2 Peer is authorized for the requested
   services possibly with the assistance of the operator's Diameter
   servers.  Moreover, this document does not assume that the IKEv2
   Server has the pre-shared secrets (PSK) with the IKEv2 Peer.
   Instead, it allows for PSK to be derived for a specific IKEv2 session
   and exchanged between IKEv2 Server and HAAA.  This is accomplished
   through the use of a new Diameter application specifically designed
   for performing IKEv2 authorization decisions.  This document
   specifies the Diameter support for shared secrets (PSK) based IKEv2.

4.  Protocol Description

4.1.  Support for IKEv2 and Pre-Shared Secrets

   When IKEv2 is used with PSK-based initiator authentication, the
   Diameter commands IKEv2-PSK-Request and IKEv2-PSK-Answer defined in
   this document are used to authorize the IKEv2 Peer for the services.
   Upon receiving the IKE_AUTH message from the IKEv2 Peer, the IKEv2
   Server uses the information received in IDi to determine if it has
   the PSK for this IKEv2 Peer.  If there is no PSK found associated
   with this IKEv2 Peer, the IKEv2 Server MUST send an Authorize-Only
   (Auth-Request-Type set to "Authorize-Only") Diameter IKEv2-PSK
   message with the IKEv2 Peer's IDi payload to the HAAA to obtain the
   PSK.  The IDi payload extracted from the IKE_AUTH message has to
   contain an identity that is meaningful for the Diameter
   infrastructure, such as a Network Access Identifier (NAI), since it
   is used by the IKEv2 Server to populate the User-Name AVP in the
   Diameter message.  The IKEv2 Server also includes in the IKEv2-Nonces
   AVP of the same Diameter message the initiator and responder nonces
   (Ni and Nr) exchanged during initial IKEv2 exchange.

   This message is routed to the IKEv2 Peer's HAAA.  Upon receiving
   Diameter IKEv2-PSK message from the IKEv2 Server, the HAAA shall use
   the User-Name AVP to retrieve the associated keying material.  The
   HAAA SHALL use the nonces Ni and Nr received in IKEv2-Nonces AVP to
   generate the PSK.  It is outside of scope of this document how the
   HAAA obtains or generates the PSK.  For example, if the HAAA
   previously performed EAP based access authentication and
   authorization of the IKEv2 Peer, it can use the available EMSK to
   generate the PSK [RFC5295].  The HAAA returns the PSK to the IKEv2
   Server using the Master-Security-Association AVP.

   Once the IKEv2 Server receives the PSK from the HAAA, the IKEv2
   Server verifies the IKE_AUTH message received from the IKEv2 Peer.
   If the verification of AUTH is successful, the IKEv2 Server sends the
   IKE message back to the IKEv2 Peer.

4.2.  Session Management

   The HAAA may maintain state or may be stateless.  This is indicated
   by presence or absence of the Auth-Session-State AVP.  The IKEv2
   Server MUST support the Authorization Session State Machine defined
   in [RFC3588].

   This specification makes an assumption that each IKE_SA created
   between the IKEv2 Peer and the IKEv2 Server as a result of a
   successful IKEv2 negotiation exchange together with CHILD_SAs set up
   through that particular IKE_SA correspond to one currently active PSK

   and one active Diameter session.

4.2.1.  Session-Termination-Request/Answer

   In the case where session tracking is being used, when the IKEv2
   Server terminates the SA it SHALL send a Session-Termination-Request
   (STR) message [RFC3588] to inform the HAAA that the authorized
   session has been terminated.

   The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the
   HAAA to acknowledge the notification that the session has been
   terminated.

4.2.2.  AbortSession-Request/Answer

   The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message [RFC3588] is sent by the HAAA
   to the IKEv2 Server to terminate the authorized session.  When the
   IKEv2 Server receives the ASR message, it MUST delete the
   corresponding IKE_SA and all CHILD_SAs set up through it.

   The Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the IKEv2
   Server in response to an ASR message.

8.  AVP Flag Rules

   The following table describes the Diameter AVPs, their AVP Code
   values, types, possible flag values, and whether the AVP MAY be
   encrypted.  The Diameter base [RFC3588] specifies the AVP Flag rules
   for AVPs in Section 4.5.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the namespaces that have either been created in
   this specification or had their values assigned to existing
   namespaces managed by IANA.

9.1.  Command Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate a command code value for the IKEv2-PSK-
   Request message (IKEPSKR) and for the IKEv2-PSK-Answer message
   (IKEPSKA) from the Command Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].  See
   Section 5 for the assignment of the namespace in this specification.

9.2.  AVP Codes

   This specification requires IANA to register the following new AVPs
   from the AVP Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].


   o  Master-Security-Association

   o  Key

   o  MSA-Lifetime

   o  MSA-SPI

   o  IKEv2-Nonces

   o  Ni

   o  Nr


   The AVPs are defined in Section 6.

9.3.  Application Identifier

   This specification requires IANA to allocate one new value "Diameter
   IKE PSK" from the Application Identifier namespace defined in
   [RFC3588].

   Application Identifier         | Value
   -------------------------------+------
   Diameter IKE PSK (IKEPSK)      | TBD

10.  Security Considerations

   Any authentication and key agreement protocol with pre-shared keys
   between an end-user client and AAA infrastructure relies on the
   assumption that the client and network can mutually authenticate each
   other.  In context of, for example, 3GPP networks, the HAAA sharing a
   PSK with the IKEv2 Server is similar to the HSS sharing an
   authentication vector with the SGSN or MME in AKA based mutual
   authentication protocols.

   The basic security assumptions in sharing the PSK are based on the
   following standard considerations.

   o  The security tunnel between the HAAA and the IKEv2 Server is
      typically a mutually authenticated tunnel, with ciphering and
      integrity protection for every packet.  The existence of such
      tunnels ensures that on-going trust and security are enforced, and
      in particular the HAAA can guarantee that the IKEv2 Server is not
      misbehaving.

   o  The protocol under discussion relies on the fact an IKEv2 Peer has
      successfully authenticated with the system and has, for example,
      an EMSK stored in the HAAA.  The fact that the PSK is derived from
      the EMSK proves to the HAAA of the existence of an authenticated
      and active IKEv2 Peer.

   o  If the HAAA is to treat an IKEv2 Server as adversarial, then we
      claim that under no circumstances can an IKEv2 Peer communicate
      with that IKEv2 Server.  Recall that any authentication and key
      agreement protocol with pre-shared keys between an end-user client
      and AAA infrastructure relies on the assumption that the client
      and network can mutually authenticate each other, and furthermore
      the client trusts the network elements that the AAA communicates
      with and delegates post authentication security parameters to be
      legitimate.  If the HAAA is to treat the IKEv2 Server as
      adversarial, then the trust assumption is no longer valid.  This
      in turn implies that the IKEv2 Peer is no longer guaranteed that
      the network elements it is communicating with are trusted.


   Hence the following two assumptions are critical to ensure secure
   communications:

   o  The HAAA server and the IKEv2 Server share a trust relationship;
      for instance, may be owned and managed by the same network
      operator.

   o  Moreover, transfer of keys between the HAAA and the IKEv2 Server
      rely on an existing security association between the above network
      elements.


   In addition, the security considerations of the Diameter Base
   protocol [RFC3588] are applicable to this document.

   MIKEY-IBAKE: Identity-Based Mode of Key Distribution in Multimedia
                        Internet KEYing (MIKEY)
                    draft-cakulev-mikey-ibake-06.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a key management protocol variant for the
   multimedia Internet keying (MIKEY) protocol which relies on a trusted
   key management service.  In particular, this variant utilizes
   Identity Based Authenticated Key Exchange framework which allows the
   participating clients to perform mutual authentication and derive a
   session key in an asymmetric identity based encryption framework.
   This protocol, in addition to providing mutual authentication,
   eliminates the key escrow problem that is common in standard Identity
   Based Encryption and provides perfect forward and backward secrecy.

Internet-Draft                 MIKEY-IBAKE                    March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) [RFC3830] specification
   describes several modes of key distribution solution that address
   multimedia scenarios using pre-shared keys, public keys, and
   optionally a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  Multiple extensions of
   MIKEY have been specified, such as HMAC-Authenticated Diffie-Hellman
   [RFC4650] and MIKEY-RSA-R [RFC4738].

   To address deployment scenarios in which security systems serve a
   large number of users, a key management service is often preferred.
   With such a service in place, it would be possible for a user to
   request credentials for any other user when they are needed.  Some
   proposed solutions [I-D.mattsson-mikey-ticket] rely on Key Management
   Services (KMS) in the network that create, distribute, and manage
   keys in a real time.  Due to this broad functionality, key management
   services would have to be online, maintain high availability, and
   have to be networked across operator boundaries.

   This document describes a solution in which KMS's are low
   availability servers that communicate with end-user clients
   periodically (e.g., once a month).  The on-line transactions between
   the end-user clients (for media plane security) are based on Identity
   Based Encryption [BF].  These on-line transactions between the end-
   user clients allow them to perform mutual authentication and derive a
   session key not known to any external entity (including KMS's).  This
   protocol, in addition to providing keys not known to any external
   entity, and allowing for end-user clients to mutually authenticate
   each other (at the media plane layer), provides perfect forward and
   backward secrecy.  In this protocol the KMS to client exchange is
   used sparingly (e.g., once a month) - hence the KMS is no longer
   required to be a high availability server, and in particular
   different KMS's don't have to communicate with each other (across
   operator boundaries).  Moreover, given that an identity-based
   encryption is used, the need for costly Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI) and all the operational costs of certificate management and
   revocation are eliminated.  This is achieved by concatenating public
   keys with a date field, thereby ensuring corresponding private keys
   change with the date, and more importantly limiting the damage due to
   loss of a private key to just that date while not requiring endpoints
   involved in communication to be time synchronized.  The granularity
   in the date field is a matter of security policy and deployment
   scenario.  For instance, an operator may choose to use one key per
   day and hence the KMS may issue private keys for a whole subscription
   cycle at the beginning of a subscription cycle.  Therefore, unlike in
   the PKI systems, where issued certificate is typically valid for
   period of time thereby requiring revocation procedures to limit their
   validity, the scheme described in this document uses time-bound

   public identities, which automatically expire at the end of a time
   span indicated in the identity itself.  With the self-expiration of
   the public identities, the traditional real time validity
   verification and revocation is not required.  For example, if the
   public identity is bound to one day, than at the end of the day the
   public/private key pair issued to this peer will simply not be valid
   anymore.  Nevertheless, just like with public-key based certificate
   systems, if there is a need to revoke keys before the designated
   expiry time, communication with a third party will be needed.

   Additionally, various call scenarios are securely supported - this
   includes secure forking, retargeting, deferred delivery and pre-
   encoded content.

   MIKEY is widely used in the 3GPP community.  This specification is
   intended primarily for use with 3GPP media security, but may also be
   applicable in Internet applications.

3.  Use Case Scenarios

   This section describes some of the use case scenarios supported by
   MIKEY-IBAKE, in addition to regular two party communication.

3.1.  Forking

   Forking is the delivery of a request (e.g., SIP INVITE message) to
   multiple end points.  This happens when a single user is registered
   more than once.  An example of forking is when a user has a desk
   phone, PC client, and mobile handset all registered with the same
   public identity.

                                      Request
                               ------------------------------------->

                             Figure 1: Forking

3.2.  Retargeting

   Retargeting is a scenario in which a functional element decides to
   redirect the session to a different destination.  This decision to
   redirect a session may be made for different reasons by a number of
   different functional elements, and at different points in the
   establishment of the session.

   There are two basic scenarios of session redirection.  In scenario
   one, a functional element (e.g., Proxy) decides to redirect the
   session by passing the new destination information to the originator.
   As a result the originator initiates a new session to the redirected
   destination provided by the Proxy.  For the case of MIKEY-IBAKE this
   means that the originator will initiate a new session with the
   identity of the redirected destination.  This scenario is depicted in
   Figure 2 below.

                                      Request
           ---------------------------------------------------------->

                           Figure 2: Retargeting

   In the second scenario, a proxy decides to redirect the session
   without informing the originator.  This is a common scenario
   specified in SIP [RFC3261].

3.3.  Deferred Delivery

   Deferred delivery is a type of service such that the session content
   cannot be delivered to the destination at the time that it is being
   sent (e.g., the destination user is not currently online).
   Nevertheless, the sender expects the network to deliver the message
   as soon as the recipient becomes available.  A typical example of
   deferred delivery is voicemail.

4.  MIKEY-IBAKE Protocol Description

4.1.  Overview

   Most of the previously defined MIKEY modes consist of a single (or
   half) roundtrip between two peers.  MIKEY-IBAKE consists of up to
   three roundtrips.  In the first roundtrip, users (Initiator and
   Responder) obtain their Private Key(s) (K_PR) from the KMS.  This
   roundtrip can be performed at anytime, and as explained earlier takes
   place for example once a month (or once per subscription cycle).  The
   second and the third roundtrip are between the Initiator and the
   Responder.  Observe that the Key Management Service is only involved
   in the first roundtrip.  In Figure 3, a conceptual signaling diagram
   for the MIKEY-IBAKE mode is depicted.

                    Figure 3: Example Message Exchange

   The Initiator (I) wants to establish a secure media session with the
   Responder (R).  The Initiator and the Responder trust a third party,
   the Key Management Service (KMS), with which they both have, or can
   establish, shared credentials.  These pre-established trust relations
   are used by a user (i.e., Initiator and Responder) to obtain private
   keys.  Rather than a single KMS, several different KMSs may be
   involved, e.g. one for the Initiator and one for the Responder as
   shown in Figure 3 above.  The Initiator and the Responder do not
   share any credentials; however, the Initiator knows Responder's
   public identity.  The assumed trust model is illustrated in Figure 4.

                           Figure 4: Trust Model

   Below, a description of how private keys are obtained using MIKEY
   messages is provided.  An alternative way for obtaining private keys
   using HTTP is described in [RFC5408].

   The Initiator obtains Private Key(s) from the KMS by sending a
   REQUEST_KEY_INIT message.  The REQUEST_KEY_INIT message includes
   Initiator's public identity(s) (if the Initiator has more than one
   public identity it may request Private Keys for every identity
   registered) and is protected via a MAC based on a pre-shared key or
   via a signature (similar to the MIKEY-PSK and MIKEY-RSA modes).  If
   the request is authorized, the KMS generates the requested keys,
   encodes them, and returns them in a REQUEST_KEY_RESP message.  This
   exchange takes place periodically and does not need to be performed
   every time an Initiator needs to establish a secure connection with a
   Responder.

   The Initiator next chooses a random x and computes [x]P, where P is a
   point on elliptic curve E known to all users.  The Initiator uses the
   Responder's public identity to generate Responder's public key (e.g.,
   K_PUBr=H1(IDRr||date)), where Hi is hash function known to all users,
   and the granularity in date is a matter of security policy and known
   publicly.  The Initiator then uses this generated public key to
   encrypt [x]P, IDRi and IDRr and includes this encrypted information
   in a I_MESSAGE_1 message, which is sent to the Responder.  The
   encryption is Identity Based Encryption (IBE) as specified in
   [RFC5091] and [RFC5408].  The Responder in turn IBE-decrypts the
   received message using its private key for that date, chooses random
   y and computes [y]P. Next, the Responder uses Initiator's identity
   obtained from I_MESSAGE_1 to generate Initiator's public key (e.g.,
   K_PUBi=H1(IDRi||date)) and IBE-encrypts (IDRi, IDRr, [x]P, [y]P)
   using K_PUBi, and includes it in R_MESSAGE_1 message sent to the
   Initiator.  At this point the Responder is able to generate the

   as specified in Section 5.1.

   The Initiator upon receiving and IBE-decrypting R_MESSAGE_1 message
   verifies the received [x]P. At this point the Initiator is able to
   generate the same session key as [x][y]P. Upon successful
   verification, the Initiator sends I_MESSAGE_2 message to the
   Responder, including IBE-encrypted IDRi, IDRr and previously received
   [y]P. The Responder sends a R_MESSAGE_2 message to the Initiator as
   verification.

   The above described is the most typical use case; in Section 3, some
   alternative use cases are discussed.

   MIKEY-IBAKE is based on [RFC3830], therefore the same terminology,
   processing and considerations still apply unless otherwise stated.
   Payloads containing EC Diffie-Hellman values and keys exchanged in
   I_MESSAGE/R_MESSAGE are IBE encrypted as specified in [RFC5091] and
   [RFC5408], while the keys exchanged in KEY_REQUES_INIT/
   KEY_REQUEST_RESPONSE are encrypted as specified in [RFC3830].  In all
   exchanges encryption is only applied to the payloads containing keys
   and EC Diffie-Hellman values and not to the entire messages.

4.2.  Message Exchanges and Processing

4.2.1.  REQUEST_KEY_INIT/REQUEST_KEY_RESP Message Exchange

   This exchange is used by a user (e.g.  Initiator or Responder) to
   request private keys from a trusted Key Management Service, with
   which the user has pre-shared credentials.  A full roundtrip is
   required for a user to receive keys.  As this message must ensure the
   identity of the user to the KMS, it is protected via a MAC based on a
   pre-shared key or via a signature.  The initiation message
   REQUEST_KEY_INIT comes in two variants corresponding to the pre-
   shared key (PSK) and public-key encryption (PKE) methods of
   [RFC3830].  The response message REQUEST_KEY_RESP is the same for the
   two variants and SHALL be protected by using the pre-shared/envelope
   key indicated in the REQUEST_KEY_INIT message.

4.2.1.1.  Components of the REQUEST_KEY_INIT Message

   The main objective of the REQUEST_KEY_INIT message is for a user to
   request one or more Private Keys (K_PR) from the KMS.  The user may
   request a K_PR for each public identity it possesses, as well as for
   multiple dates.

   The REQUEST_KEY_INIT message MUST always include the Header (HDR),
   Timestamp (T), and RAND payloads.  The CSB ID (Crypto Session Bundle
   ID) SHALL be assigned as in [RFC3830].  The user SHALL include it in
   the CSB ID field of the Header.  The user SHALL set the #CS field to
   '0' since CS (Crypto Session(s)) SHALL NOT be handled.  The CS ID map
   type SHALL be the "Empty map" as defined in [RFC4563].

   IDRi/r contains the identity of the user.  Since the user may have
   multiple identities, multiple IDRi/r fields may appear in the
   message.

   IDRkms SHALL be included.

   The KEMAC payload SHALL be used only when the user needs to use
   specific keys.  Otherwise, this payload SHALL NOT be used.

4.2.1.1.1.  Components of the REQUEST_KEY_INIT_PSK Message

   The IDRpsk payload MAY be used to indicate the pre-shared key used.

   The last payload SHALL be a Verification payload (V) where the
   authentication key (auth_key) is derived from the pre-shared key (see
   Section 4.1.4 of [RFC3830] for key derivation specification).

4.2.1.1.2.  Components of the REQUEST_KEY_INIT_PKE Message

   The certificate CERT payload SHOULD be included.  If a certificate
   chain is to be provided, each certificate in the chain MUST be
   included in a separate CERT payload.

   The PKE payload contains the encrypted envelope key: PKE = E(PKkms,
   env_key).  It is encrypted using the KMS's public key (PKkms).  If
   the KMS possesses several public keys, the user can indicate the key
   used in the CHASH payload.

   SIGNi/r is a signature covering the entire MIKEY message, using the
   Initiator's signature key.

4.2.1.2.  Processing of the REQUEST_KEY_INIT Message

   If the KMS can verify the integrity of the received message and the
   message can be correctly parsed, the KMS MUST check the Initiator's
   authorization.  If the Initiator is authorized to receive the
   requested private key(s), the KMS MUST send a REQUEST_KEY_RESP
   message.  Unexpected payloads in the REQUEST_KEY_INIT message SHOULD
   be ignored.  Errors are handled as described in [RFC3830].

4.2.1.3.  Components of the REQUEST_KEY_RESP Message

   The version, PRF func and CSB ID, #CS, and CS ID map type fields in
   the HDR payload SHALL be identical to the corresponding fields in the
   REQUEST_KEY_INIT message.  The KMS SHALL set the V flag to 0 and the
   user receiving it SHALL ignore it as it has no meaning in this
   context.

   The timestamp type and value SHALL be identical to the one used in
   the REQUEST_KEY_INIT message.


                      KEMAC = E(encr_key, (ID || K_PR))

   The KEMAC payload SHOULD use the NULL authentication algorithm, as a
   MAC is included in the V payload.  Depending on the type of
   REQUEST_KEY_INIT message, either the pre-shared key or the envelope
   key SHALL be used to derive the encr_key.

   The last payload SHALL be a Verification payload (V).  Depending on
   the type of REQUEST_KEY_INIT message, either the pre-shared key or
   the envelope key SHALL be used to derive the auth_key.

4.2.1.4.  Processing of the REQUEST_KEY_RESP Message

   If the Initiator/Responder can correctly parse the received message,
   the received session information SHOULD be stored.  Otherwise the
   Initiator/Responder SHOULD silently discard the message and abort the
   protocol.

4.2.2.  I_MESSAGE/R_MESSAGE Message Exchanges

   This exchange is used for Initiator and Responder to mutually
   authenticate each other and to exchange EC Diffie-Hellman values used
   to generate TGK.  These exchanges are modeled after the pre-shared
   key mode, with the exception that the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   values and Secret Keys (SKs) are encoded in IBAKE and ESK payloads
   instead of a KEMAC payload.  Two full roundtrips are required for
   this exchange to successfully complete.  The messages are preferably
   included in the session setup signaling (e.g.  SIP INVITE).


   Initiator                               Responder

      I_MESSAGE_1 =                    ---->

                                                IDRr, IBAKE

      I_MESSAGE_2 =                    ---->

                                              [IBAKE], V


4.2.2.1.  Components of the I_MESSAGE_1 Message

   The I_MESSAGE_1 message MUST always include the Header (HDR),
   Timestamp (T), and RAND payloads.  The CSB ID (Crypto Session Bundle
   ID) SHALL be randomly selected by the Initiator.  As the R_MESSAGE_1
   message is mandatory, the Initiator indicates with the V flag that a
   verification message is expected.

   The IDRi and IDRr payloads SHALL be included.

   The IBAKE payload contains Initiator's Identity and EC Diffie-Hellman
   values (ECCPTi), and Responder's Identity all encrypted using
   Responder's public key (i.e. encr_key = K_PUBr) as follows:

                      IBAKE = E(encr_key, IDRi || ECCPTi || IDRr)

   Optionally, Encrypted Secret Key (ESK) payload MAY be included.  If
   included, ESK contains an identity and a Secret Key (SK) encrypted
   using intended Responder's Public Key (i.e. encr_key = K_PUBr).


                      ESK = E(encr_key, ID || SK)

4.2.2.2.  Processing of the I_MESSAGE_1 Message

   The parsing of I_MESSAGE_1 message SHALL be done as in [RFC3830].  If
   the received message is correctly parsed, the Responder SHALL use the
   Private Key (K_PRr) corresponding to the received IDRr to decrypt the
   IBAKE payload.  If the message contains encrypted ESK payload, the
   Responder SHALL decrypt the SK and use it to decrypt the received
   IBAKE payload.  Otherwise, if the Responder is not able to decrypt
   the IBAKE payload, the Responder SHALL indicate it to the Initiator
   by including only its own EC Diffie-Hellman value (ECCPTr) in the
   next message (i.e.  R_MESSAGE_1) it sends to the Initiator.

   If the received message cannot be correctly parsed, the Responder
   SHOULD silently discard the message and abort the protocol.

4.2.2.3.  Components of the R_MESSAGE_1 Message

   The version, PRF func, CSB ID, #CS, and CS ID map type fields in the
   HDR payload SHALL be identical to the corresponding fields in the
   I_MESSAGE_1 message.  The V flag SHALL be set to 1 as I_MESSAGE_2
   message is mandatory.

   The timestamp type and value SHALL be identical to the one used in
   the I_MESSAGE_1 message.

   The IDRi and IDRr payloads SHALL be included.  The IDRi payload SHALL
   be as received in the I_MESSAGE_1.  In the IDRr payload, the
   Responder SHALL include its own identity.  Note that this identity
   might be different from the identity contained in the IDRr payload
   received in I_MESSAGE_1 message.  The IDRr payloads of I_MESSAGE_1
   and R_MESSAGE_1 will be different in the case of forking, retargeting
   and deferred delivery.

   The Responder's IBAKE payload contains the Initiator's EC Diffie-
   Hellman value (ECCPTi) received in I_MESSAGE_1 (if successfully
   decrypted), and Initiator's EC Diffie-Hellman value generated by
   Responder (ECCPTr), as well as corresponding Initiator and
   Responder's identities.  If the responder is unable to decrypt the
   IBAKE payload received in I_MESSAGE_1 (e.g., the message is received

   by the intended Responder's mailbox), the Responder SHALL include
   only its own EC Diffie-Hellman value (ECCPTr).  The IBAKE payload in
   R_MESSAGE_1 is encrypted using Initiator's public key (i.e. encr_key
   = P_PUBi) as follows:


           IBAKE = E(encr_key, IDRi || {ECCPTi} || IDRr || ECCPTr)

4.2.2.4.  Processing of the R_MESSAGE_1 Message

   The parsing of R_MESSAGE_1 message SHALL be done as in [RFC3830].  If
   the received message is correctly parsed, the Initiator shall use the
   Private Key corresponding to the received IDRi to decrypt the IBAKE
   payload.  If the ECCPTi sent in I_MESSAGE_1 is not present in the
   received IBAKE payload (e.g., the Responder is currently offline and
   the R_MESSAGE_1 is received from Responder's mailbox), the Initiator
   SHALL include ECCPTi again in the next message, I_MESSAGE_2.  In this
   case I_MESSAGE_2 SHALL also contain a ESK payload encrypted using
   intended recipient's K_PUB.

   If the received message cannot be correctly parsed, the Initiator
   SHOULD silently discard the message and abort the protocol.

4.2.2.5.  Components of the I_MESSAGE_2 Message

   The I_MESSAGE_2 message MUST always include the Header (HDR),
   Timestamp (T), and RAND payloads.  The version, PRF func, CSB ID,
   #CS, and CS ID map type fields in the HDR payload SHALL be identical
   to the corresponding fields in the R_MESSAGE_2 message.  As the
   R_MESSAGE_2 message is mandatory, the Initiator indicates with the V
   flag that a verification message is expected.

   The IDRi and IDRr payloads SHALL be included.  The IDRr payload SHALL
   be the same as the IDRr payload received in the R_MESSAGE_1.

   The Initiator's IBAKE payload SHALL contain Initiator's EC Diffie-
   Hellman value (ECCPTi) if the ECCPTi was not received in R_MESSAGE_1.
   Otherwise, ECCPTi SHALL NOT be included.  The IBAKE payload in
   I_MESSAGE_2 SHALL contain the Initiator's and Responder's identities
   as well as Responder's EC Diffie-Hellman value received in message
   R_MESSAGE_1.  IBAKE payload SHALL be encrypted using Responder's
   public key (i.e. encr_key = K_PUBr) as follows:


             IBAKE = E(encr_key, IDRi || {ECCPTi} || IDRr || ECCPTr)

   Optionally, Encrypted Secret Key (ESK) payload can be included.  ESK
   SHALL be included in case R_MESSAGE_1 did not contain Initiator's EC

   Diffie-Hellman value (ECCPTi) (e.g., in the case of deferred
   delivery).  If included, it contains an Initiator's identity and
   Initiator generated Secret Key (SK) encrypted using intended
   recipient Public Key (i.e. encr_key = K_PUB) as follows:


                      ESK = E(encr_key, ID || SK)

4.2.2.6.  Processing of the I_MESSAGE_2 Message

   The parsing of I_MESSAGE_2 message SHALL be done as in [RFC3830].  If
   the received message is correctly parsed, the Responder shall use the
   K_PRr corresponding to the received IDRr to decrypt the IBAKE
   payload.  If ESK is received, the responder SHALL store it for the
   future use (e.g., the Responder is a mailbox and will forward the key
   to the user once the user is online).

   If the received message cannot be correctly parsed, the Responder
   SHOULD silently discard the message and abort the protocol.

4.2.2.7.  Components of the R_MESSAGE_2 Message

   The version, PRF func, CSB ID, #CS, and CS ID map type fields in the
   HDR payload SHALL be identical to the corresponding fields in the
   I_MESSAGE_2 message.  The V flag SHALL be set to 0 by the Responder
   and ignored by the Initiator.

   The timestamp type and value SHALL be identical to the one used in
   the I_MESSAGE_2 message.

   The IDRi and IDRr payloads SHOULD be included.

   If Initiator's EC Diffie-Hellman value (ECCPTi) was received in
   I_MESSAGE_2, the Responder SHALL also include the IBAKE payload.  If
   included, the IBAKE payload SHALL contain Initiator's EC Diffie-
   Hellman value (ECCPTi), and the Initiator's identity previously
   received in I_MESSAGE_2, encrypted using Initiator's public key (i.e.
   encr_key = K_PUBi) as follows:


                    IBAKE = E(encr_key, IDRi || ECCPTi)

   The last payload SHALL be a Verification payload (V) where the
   authentication key (auth_key) is derived as specified in Section 5.2.

5.  Key Management

   The keys used in REQUEST_KEY_INIT/REQUEST_KEY_RESP exchange are
   derived from the pre-shared key or the envelope key as specified in
   [RFC3830].  As crypto sessions are not handled in this exchange,
   further keying material (i.e TEKs) for this message exchanges SHALL
   NOT be derived.

5.1.  Generating Keys from the Session Key

   As stated above, the session key [x][y]P is generated using exchanged
   EC Diffie-Hellman values, where x and y are randomly chosen by
   Initiator and Responder.  The session key as a point on an elliptic
   curve is then converted into octet string as specified in [SEC1].
   This octet string K_SESSION is then used to generate MPK and TGK.
   Finally, the traffic encryption keys (e.g., TEK) are generated from
   TGK as specified in [RFC3830].

   The MPK and TGK are generated from K_SESSION as follows.


      inkey      : K_SESSION
      inkey_len  : bit length of the MPK
      label      : constant || 0xFF || 0xFFFFFFFF || RAND
      outkey_len : desired bit length of the output key (MPK or TGK)

   The constant depends on the derived key type as summarized below.

                       +-------------+------------+
                       | Derived Key |  Constant  |
                       +-------------+------------+
                       |     MPK     | 0x220E99A2 |
                       |             |            |
                       |     TGK     | 0x1F4D675B |
                       +-------------+------------+

                   Table 1: Constants for key derivation

   The constants are taken from the decimal digits of e as described in
   [RFC3830].

5.2.  Generating Keys for MIKEY Messages

   The keys for MIKEY messages are used to protect the MIKEY messages
   exchanged between the Initiator and Responder (i.e., I_MESSAGE and
   R_MESSAGE).  In the REQUEST_KEY_INIT/REQUEST_KEY_RESP exchange, the
   key derivation SHALL be done exactly as in [RFC3830].

Internet-Draft                 MIKEY-IBAKE                    March 2011


   MIKEY Protection Key (MPK) for I_MESSAGE/R_MESSAGE exchange is
   generated as described in Section 5.1.  This MPK is then used to
   derive keys to protect R_MESSAGE_2 message.


      inkey      : MPK
      inkey_len  : bit length of the MPK
      label      : constant || 0xFF || csb_id || RAND
      outkey_len : desired bit length of the output key

   where the constants are as defined in [RFC3830].

5.3.  CSB Update

   Similar to [RFC3830], MIKEY-IBAKE provides means for updating the CSB
   (Crypto Session Bundle), e.g. transporting new EC Diffe-Hellman
   values or adding new crypto sessions.  The CSB updating is done by
   executing the exchange of I_MESSAGE_1/R_MESSAGE_1.  The CSB updating
   MAY be started by either the Initiator or the Responder.


      Initiator                               Responder

      I_MESSAGE_1 =                 ---->
      HDR, T, [IDRi], [IDRr],
         [IBAKE]                    <----     R_MESSAGE_1 =
                                              HDR, T, [IDRi], [IDRr],
                                              [IBAKE], V


      Responder                               Initiator

      I_MESSAGE_1 =                 ---->
      HDR, T, [IDRr], [IDRi],
         [IBAKE]                    <----     R_MESSAGE_1 =
                                              HDR, T, [IDRi], [IDRr],
                                              [IBAKE], V

   The new message exchange MUST use the same CSB ID as the initial
   exchange, but MUST use a new timestamp.  Other payloads that were
   provided in the initial exchange SHOULD NOT be included.  New RANDs
   MUST NOT be included in the message exchange (the RANDs will only
   have effect in the initial exchange).

   IBAKE payload with new EC Diffie-Hellman values SHOULD be included.
   If new EC Diffie-Hellman values are being exchanged during CSB
   updating, messages SHALL be protected with keys derived from EC
   Diffie-Hellman values exchanged as specified in Section 5.2.

   Otherwise, if new EC Diffie-Hellman values are not being exchanged
   during CSB update exchange, messages SHALL be protected with the keys
   that protected the I_MESSAGE/R_MESSAGE messages in the initial
   exchange.

5.4.  Generating MAC and Verification Message

   Authentication tag in all MIKEY-IBAKE messages is generated as
   described in [RFC3830].  The MPK as described above is used to derive
   the auth_key.  The MAC/Signature in the V/SIGN payloads covers the
   entire MIKEY message, except the MAC/Signature field itself and if
   there is an ESK payload in the massage it SHALL be omitted from MAC/

6.  Payload Encoding

   This section does not describe all the payloads that are used in the
   new message types.  It describes in detail the new IBAKE and ESK
   payloads and in less detail the payloads for which changes has been
   made compared to [RFC3830].  For a detailed description of the MIKEY
   payloads (e.g.  Timestamp (T) payload, RAND payload, etc.), see
   [RFC3830].  For the description of IDR payload as well as for the
   definition of additional PRF functions and encryption algorithms not
   defined in [RFC3830], see [I-D.mattsson-mikey-ticket].

6.1.  Common Header Payload (HDR)

   For the Common Header Payload, new values are added to the data type
   and the next payload name spaces.

   o  V (1 bits): flag to indicate whether a response message is
      expected or not (this only has meaning when it is set in an
      initiation message).  If a response is required, the V flag SHALL
      always be set to 1 in the initiation messages and the receiver of
      the initiation message (Responder or KMS) SHALL ignore it.

7.  Security Considerations

   Unless explicitly stated, the security properties of the MIKEY
   protocol as described in [RFC3830] apply to MIKEY-IBAKE as well.  In
   addition, MIKEY-IBAKE is based on the basic Identity Based Encryption
   protocol, as specified in [RFC5091], [RFC5408] and [RFC5409], and as
   such inherits some properties of that protocol.  For instance, by
   concatenating the "date" with the identity (to derive the public
   key), the need for any key revocation mechanisms is virtually
   eliminated.  Moreover, by allowing the participants to acquire
   multiple private keys (e.g., for duration of contract) the
   availability requirements on the KMS are also reduced without any
   reduction in security.

7.1.  General Security Considerations

   MIKEY-IBAKE protocol relies on the use of Identity-Based Encryption.
   [RFC5091] describes attacks on the cryptographic algorithms used in
   Identity Based Encryption.  In addition, [RFC5091] provides
   recommendations for security parameters for described IBE algorithms.

   It is assumed that the Key Management Services are secure, not
   compromised, trusted, and will not engage in launching active attacks
   independently or in a collaborative environment.  However, any
   malicious insider could potentially launch passive attacks (by
   decryption of one or more message exchanges offline).  While it is in
   the best interest of administrators to prevent such attacks, it is
   hard to eliminate this problem.  Hence, it is assumed that such
   problems will persist, and hence the protocols are designed to
   protect participants from passive adversaries.

7.2.  IBAKE Protocol Security Considerations

   For the basic IBAKE protocol from a cryptographic perspective
   following security considerations apply.

   In every step Identity Based Encryption (IBE) is used, with the
   recipient's public key.  This guarantees that only the intended
   recipient of the message can decrypt the message [BF].

   Next, the use of identities within the encrypted payload is intended
   to eliminate some basic reflection attacks.  For instance, suppose
   identities were not used as part of the encrypted payload, in the
   first step of the IBAKE protocol (i.e., I_MESSAGE_1 of Figure 3 in
   Section 4.1).  Furthermore, assume an adversary who has access to the
   conversation between initiator and responder and can actively snoop
   into packets and drop/modify them before routing them to the
   destination.  For instance, assume that the IP source address and

Internet-Draft                 MIKEY-IBAKE                    March 2011


   destination address can be modified by the adversary.  After the
   first message is sent by the initiator (to the responder), the
   adversary can take over and trap the packet.  Next, the adversary can
   modify the IP source address to include adversary's IP address,
   before routing it onto the responder.  The responder will assume the
   request for an IBAKE session came from the adversary, and will
   execute step 2 of the IBAKE protocol (i.e., R_MESSAGE_1 of Figure 3
   in Section 4.1) but encrypt it using the adversary's public key.  The
   above message can be decrypted by the adversary (and only by the
   adversary).  In particular, since the second message includes the
   challenge sent by the initiator to the responder, the adversary will
   now learn the challenge sent by the initiator.  Following this, the
   adversary can carry on a conversation with the initiator "pretending"
   to be the responder.  This attack will be eliminated if identities
   are used as part of the encrypted payload.  In summary, at the end of
   the exchange both initiator and responder can mutually authenticate
   each other and agree on a session key.

   Recall that Identity Based Encryption guarantees that only the
   recipient of the message can decrypt the message using the private
   key.  The caveat being, the KMS which generated the private key of
   recipient of message can decrypt the message as well.  However, the
   KMS cannot learn the session key [x][y]P given [x]P and [y]P based on
   the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman problem.  This property of
   resistance to passive key escrow from the KMS, is not applicable to
   the basic IBE protocols proposed in [RFC5091], [RFC5408] and
   [RFC5409].

   Observe that the protocol works even if the initiator and responder
   belong to two different Key Management Services.  In particular, the
   parameters used for encryption to the responder and parameters used
   for encryption to the initiator can be completely different and
   independent of each other.  Moreover, the Elliptic Curve used to
   generate the session key [x][y]P can be completely different.  If
   such flexibility is desired, then it would be advantageous to add
   optional extra data to the protocol to exchange the algebraic
   primitives used in deriving the session key.

   In addition to mutual authentication, and resistance to passive
   escrow, the Diffie-Hellman property of the session key exchange
   guarantees perfect secrecy of keys.  In others, accidental leakage of
   one session key does not compromise past or future session keys
   between the same initiator and responder.

7.3.  Forking

   In the Forking feature, given that there are multiple potential
   responders, it is important to observe that there is one "common

Internet-Draft                 MIKEY-IBAKE                    March 2011


   responder" identity (and corresponding public and private keys) and
   each responder has a unique identity (and corresponding public and
   private keys).  Observe that, in this framework if one responder
   responds to the invite from the initiator it uses its unique identity
   such that the protocol guarantees that no other responder learns the
   session key.

7.4.  Retargeting

   In the Retargeting feature, the forwarding server does not learn the
   private key of the intended responder since it is encrypted using the
   retargeted responder's public key.  Additionally, the initiator will
   learn that the retargeted responder answered the phone (and not the
   intended responder) since the retargeted responder includes its own
   identity in the message sent to the initiator.  This will allow the
   initiator to decide whether or not to carry on the conversation.
   Finally, the session key cannot be discovered by intended responder
   since the random number chosen by the retargeted responder is not
   known to the intended responder.

7.5.  Deferred Delivery

   In the Deferred Delivery feature, the initiator and the responder's
   mailbox will mutually authenticate each other thereby preventing
   server side "phishing" attacks and conversely guarantees to the
   server (and eventually to the responder) the identity of the
   initiator.  Moreover, the key used by initiator to encrypt the
   contents of the message is completely independent from the session
   key derived between the initiator and the server.  Finally, the key
   used to encrypt the message is encrypted using the responder's public
   key which allows the contents of the message to remain unknown to the
   mailbox server.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines several new values for the namespaces Data
   Type, Next Payload, and Key Data Type defined in [RFC3830].  The
   following IANA assignments were added to the MIKEY Payload registry
   (in bracket is a reference to the table containing the registered
   values):

   o  Data Type (see Table 2)

   o  Next Payload (see Table 3)

   o  Key Data Type (see Table 4)

   The ECCPT payload defines an 8-bit ECC Curve field for which IANA is
   to create and maintain a new namespace in the MIKEY Payload registry.
   Assignments consist of a ECC curve and its associated value.  Values
   in the range 1-239 SHOULD be approved by the process of Specification
   Required, values in the range 240-254 are for Private Use, and the
   values 0 and 255 are Reserved according to [RFC5226].  The initial
   contents of the registry should be as follows:


           Value    ECC curve
           -------  ------------------------------------

           14       ECPRGF521Random  / P-521 / secp521r1
           15       EC2NGF571Random  / B-571 / sect571r1
           16       EC2NGF571Koblitz / K-571 / sect571k1
           17-239   Unassigned
           240-254  Private Use
           255      Reserved

   The SK sub-payload defines a 4-bit Type field for which IANA is to
   create and maintain a new namespace in the MIKEY Payload registry.

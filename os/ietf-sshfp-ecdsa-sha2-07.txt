Abstract

   This document updates IANA registries defined in RFC4255, which
   defines a DNS resource record - SSHFP that contains a standard SSH
   key fingerprint used to verify Secure Shell (SSH) host keys using
   Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC).  This document defines
   additional options supporting Secure Shell (SSH) public keys using
   the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and the use of
   fingerprints computed using the SHA-256 message digest algorithm in
   SSHFP resource records (SSHFP RR).

Internet-Draft   ECDSA and SHA-256 Algorithms for SSHFP     January 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global, hierarchical distributed
   database for Internet Naming.  The Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol
   for secure remote login and other secure network services over an
   insecure network.  RFC 4253 [RFC4253] defines Public Key Algorithms
   for the Secure Shell server public keys.

   The DNS has been extended to store fingerprints in a DNS resource
   record named SSHFP [RFC4255], which provides out-of-band verification
   by looking up a fingerprint of the server public key in the DNS
   [RFC1034], [RFC1035] and using Domain Name System Security Extensions
   (DNSSEC) [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035] to verify the lookup.

   RFC 4255 [RFC4255] describes how to store the cryptographic
   fingerprint of SSH public keys in SSHFP resource records.  SSHFP
   records contain the fingerprint and two index numbers identifying the
   cryptographic algorithms used:
   1.  to link the fingerprinted public key with the corresponding
       private key, and
   2.  to derive the message digest stored as the fingerprint in the
       record.
   RFC 4255 [RFC4255] then specifies lists of cryptographic algorithms
   and the corresponding index numbers used to identify them in SSHFP
   records.

   This document updates the IANA registry "SSHFP RR Types for public
   key algorithms" and "SSHFP RR types for fingerprint types"
   [SSHFPVALS] by adding a new option in each list:
   o  the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)[RFC6090]
      which has been added to the Secure Shell Public Key list by RFC
      5656 [RFC5656] in the public key algorithms list;
   o  the SHA-256 algorithm [FIPS.180-3.2008] in the SSHFP Fingerprint
      Type list.

   Familiarity with DNSSEC, SSH Protocol [RFC4251], [RFC4253],
   [RFC4250], SSHFP [RFC4255], and the SHA-2 [FIPS.180-3.2008] family of
   algorithms is assumed in this document.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft   ECDSA and SHA-256 Algorithms for SSHFP     January 2012


3.  SSHFP Resource Records

   The format of the SSHFP RR can be found in RFC 4255 [RFC4255].

3.1.  SSHFP Fingerprint Type Specification

   The fingerprint type octet identifies the message-digest algorithm
   used to calculate the fingerprint of the public key.

3.1.1.  SHA-256 SSHFP Fingerprint Type Specification

   SHA-256 fingerprints of the public keys are stored in SSHFP Resource
   Record with the fingerprint type 2.

3.2.  SSHFP Algorithm Number Specification

   The SSHFP Resource Record algorithm number octet describes the
   algorithm of the public key.

3.2.1.  ECDSA SSHFP Algorithm Number Specification

   ECDSA public keys are stored in SSHFP Resource Records with the
   algorithm number 3.

4.  Implementation Considerations

4.1.  Support for SHA-256 fingerprints

   SSHFP-aware Secure Shell implementations SHOULD support the SHA-256
   fingerprints for verification of the public key.  Secure Shell
   implementations which support SHA-256 fingerprints MUST prefer a SHA-
   256 fingerprint over SHA-1 if both are available for a server.  If
   the SHA-256 fingerprint is tested and does not match the key SSH
   public key received from the SSH server, then the key MUST be
   rejected rather than testing the alternative SHA-1 fingerprint.

4.2.  Support for ECDSA

   SSHFP-aware Secure Shell implementations which also implement ECDSA
   algorithm for the public key SHOULD support SSHFP fingerprints for
   ECDSA public keys.

5.  Examples

   The following examples provide reference for both the newly defined
   ECDSA algorithm number and the use of the SHA-256 fingerprint
   combined with both the new and the existing algorithm numbers.

7.  Security Considerations

   Please see the security considerations in [RFC4255] for SSHFP record
   and [RFC5656] for ECDSA algorithm.

   Users of SSHFP are encouraged to deploy SHA-256 as soon as
   implementations allow for it.  SHA-2 family of algorithms is widely
   believed to be more resilient to attack than SHA-1, and confidence in
   SHA-1's strength is being eroded by recently announced attacks [IACR
   2007/474].  Regardless of whether or not the attacks on SHA-1 will
   affect SSHFP, it is believed (at the time of this writing) that SHA-
   256 is the better choice for use in SSHFP records.

   SHA-256 is considered sufficiently strong for the immediate future,
   but predictions about future development in cryptography and
   cryptanalysis are beyond the scope of this document.

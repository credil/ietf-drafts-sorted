   Abstract

   Network traffic has shown the combination of few very high bit rate
   flows (large flow) and a huge amount of very low bit rate flows
   (small flow), which causes uneven load balance over ECMP or LAG.
   Differentiating large flow and small flow packets in IP/MPLS
   networks enables an enhanced ECMP transport. Enhanced ECMP applies
   different distribution methods to large flow packets and small flow
   packets to improve the load balance and congestion control. This
   draft proposes large flow classification scheme for flow awareness
   transport in PSN.

1. Introduction

   [FAT-PW] introduces a flow label on the label stack for a
   pseudowires (PW) to take the advantage of ECMP transport. The method
   inserts a flow label on each packet at ingress PE. The ECMP process
   in the packet switched network (PSN) hashes the label stack that
   contains the flow label at the bottom. As a result, individual flows


Yong                    Expires December 2011                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                 LFC-FAT                        July 2010


   in a PW can be transported over different ECMP paths. Since the
   packets that belong to the same flow have the same label value, the
   method gets ECMP transport benefit as well as preserves the ordering
   of individual transported IP flows. The method is referred to as
   Flow Aware Transport in PSN.

   However, the aggregated traffic flows today includes Web browsing
   data and audio as well as video/downloading and streaming. High-
   quality-video streaming or file download generates the very high bit
   rate flows compared to Web browsing data/audio. This results in that
   the network traffic is clearly mixed with huge amount of low bit
   rate flows and few very high bit rate flows. Internet traffic
   analysis [CAIDA] indicates that, ~2% of the top rate ranked flows
   takes about 30% of traffic volume while the rest of 98% flows
   contribute 70% of traffic volume. Carrier network even shows fewer
   percentiles of large flows that contribute more to total traffic
   volume. As Web HDTV and 3D TV will be on the Internet, the bit rate
   gap between large flows and small flows will get further higher. In
   addition, carrier IP/MPLS network carries many L3VPN and L2VPN
   services. Among these services, some traffic may be from data
   center, which may act as a single flow that can be much higher bit
   rate compared to the flow generated by any application. Although the
   flow label in PW can provide better granularity than a PW, under
   such traffic pattern, hash based flow routing can not perform even
   load balance becasue the bandwidth per flow is significant
   unbalanced.

   Experiments have shown that applying the same treatment for high bit
   rate flows and low bit rate flows conducts a poor performance or
   utilization over multiple equal cost multi paths (ECMP). If the
   network uses a stateful method for flow placement over the paths, a
   huge amount of the flows add a big burden for device to handle. If
   the network uses stateless method (hashing, [RFC2991] and
   [RFC2992]), significant rate differences make uneven load balance on
   ECMP paths. This results a desire to improve load balance over ECMP
   paths under such traffic pattern. This draft suggests applying
   different treatments on very high bit rate flows and low bit rate
   flows in flow aware transport. It drives the need for Large Flow
   Classification. This draft specifies Large Flow Classification
   scheme, which is used for ECMP load balance purpose. Other types of
   flow classification are for further study.

   Appendix A describes one example that using large flow
   classification to improves load balance over ECMP. Appendix B states
   some simulation results. Other enhanced ECMP implementations may be
   implemented by using Large Flow Classification as well.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1. Terminology

   Flow: a group of packets that contain the same flow ''identity'' in
   their header. The network intends to transport the packets that
   belong to the same flow over the same path so flow packet sequence
   is preserved.

   Large Flow: a flow comes to the network at the bit/packet rate that
   is on the top bit rate rank among all the flows

   Small Flow: a flow or data that does not belong to a large flow.

3. Large Flow Recognition

   The advanced technologies now enable router devices to inspect the
   received the packets and identifies the large flows from huge amount
   of received packets that belong to many and many different flows.
   Large flow recognition process may use protocol inspection, flow
   volume measurement, access list, or other methods to detect the
   large flows. If a router can differentiate packets that belong to
   the very high bit rate flows from all the received packets, it
   enables differentiated treatments on the large flow packets and
   small flow packets in the flow based routing in PSN. Both ECMP and
   LAG in PSN can significantly benefit from such differentiation. One
   example is given in Appendix A. Other methods can be implemented as
   well.

   It is possible for hosts to insert a large flow indication on the
   packet header. However, there is a huge security concern for a
   network to perform on the customer inserted indication.

   All ECMP or LAG in PSN can perform differentiated treatments on
   large flow packets and small flow packets. It is an obvious benefit
   that, if ingress PE performs the large flow recognition only and
   inserts a large flow indication on the packets, all the P nodes
   within PSN can distinguish the large flow packets by checking this
   indication and perform the different treatments on the packets. This
   can substantially reduce the implementation cost and the impact on
   the performance.

   The native service processing function (NSP) [RFC3985] in the
   ingress PE can identify the flow or groups of flows in a PW service,
   and insert the flow label(load balance label) on each packet before
   it is passed to the pseudowire forwarder. Large flow recognition
   process described in this document can be placed at the front of the
   pseudowire forwarder [RFC3985]. It performs the packet inspection,
   detect the large flow packets, and insert a large flow indication on
   the load balance label in packets that belong to the large flows.
   The design method for the large flow recognition is outside the
   scope of this document.

4. Large Flow Classification

   This draft specifies the protocol to encode a large flow indication
   on the flow label specified in [FAT-PW]. Figure 1 illustrates
   current flow label format specified in [RFC3032] with the amendment
   given in [RFC5462]. Label field is filled with the flow
   identification in a PW. Since the flow label never occurs on the top
   of label stack [FAT-PW], TTL field is not used. However, to prevent
   any provisioning error, [FAT-PW] recommends that TTL filed sets to
   1. S bit is used to indicate the bottom of stack and set to 1 for
   the flow label. Three bits of Traffic Class are not used in flow
   aware transport. Note: Client QoS information is transformed to
   traffic class bits on PW label.

                   Figure 1 Current Flow Label Semantics

   The document suggests using 1 bit in Flow Label Traffic Class to
   differentiate the large flow from other flows in a PW (referred to
   as small flows), and suggests value 1 to represent the large flow
   and value 0 for the small flow. The two other bits are reserved for
   the future. Since flow label, PW label, and LSP label may all be
   placed at the bottom of label stack, for differentiated flow
   treatments in PSN, it is necessary for LSR to distinguish the flow
   label from both PW label and LSP label to support backward

   compatibility. Given limited option on the flow label, the draft
   proposes setting TTL value to 0 on the flow label, which can be used
   to differentiate it from PW label and LSP label at the bottom stack.
   (However, open for other suggestion) Since the flow label and PW
   label are pushed into label stack at ingress PE and removed at
   egress PE [FAT-PW], the flow label SHALL never occur on the top
   label stack entry, which means that its TTL can be neither incoming
   TTL nor outgoing TTL [RFC3032]. If FL TTL accidentally occurred as
   outgoing TTL, the packets would be dropped locally based on RFC3032.
   Hence it can never be incoming TTL. Figure 2 shows proposed flow
   label semantics.

     Figure 2 Flow Label Semantics with Large Flow Classification

   When Flow Label is used on a PW, ingress PE can insert the flow
   label and a large flow indication on each packet; egress PE will
   trim off the PW label and flow label before sending the packets to
   the right AC. The procedure for informing flow label presence and
   label insertion procedure remains the same as [FAT-PW].

   TC bits in MPLS Label are typically used for DiffServ function which
   uses TC bits on the label that occurs on the top of label stack
   entry. [RFC3270] [RFC5129] Since Flow Label never occurs on the top
   Label Stack entry and only be used in flow based routing, DiffServ
   function does not apply to TC bits on the Flow Label. Hence the
   proposed Flow Label TC bit usage in this document does not conflict
   with DiffServ function.

   It is worth to mention the differences between DiffDerv and large
   flow classification. Although both relate to traffic classification,
   they aim on the different purposes. DiffDerv is for the network to
   perform differentiated service treatments, i.e. different queuing

   processes. Large Flow Classification apply to flow based routing in
   ECMP for load balance.

   Although control plan/signaling can be also used to inform P node
   about large flow if it is carried over one PW and one LSP, large
   flow classification in data plane serves different purposes. Today,
   signaling a PW is used per a service basis such as VPWS or VPLS and
   it can be multiplexed with other PWs into one LSP that is
   transported over PSN. The control plane at P node is only aware of
   the LSP (top label) but is not aware of the PW and Flows in the PW
   at all. Only ECMP function perform flow based routing, uses of the
   label stack, and is aware of inner label on the label stack. A
   service may contain many flows. Carriers need to set up a PW or LSP
   per a service basis not per individual flow basis. This is the case
   that the flow label is used and the large flow classification is
   necessary. Using one LSP to carry one large flow can apply to some
   cases. In this case, the control plane can determine which ECMP path
   the LSP should take.

5. Backward Compatibility

   The method fully supports backward compatibility in PSN. If a PW is
   not configured with Flow Label at the PE that supports large flow
   recognition process, the process should be disabled. If ingress PE
   does not support Large Flow Recognition and PW flow label is used,
   it SHALL set large flow classification bit as 0. If Flow label is
   used, its TTL value SHALL be set to 0. When intermediate router does
   not support the differentiated treatment, it uses hashing in ECMP or
   LAG process. If intermediate router supports the differentiated
   treatment, it performs large flow treatment if the received packets
   belong to the large flow.

6. Applicability

   Carriers have desires to improve transport network capability via
   certain service awareness in packet transport and are not to be
   constrained in just ''pipe'' transport service. [FAT-PW] brings such
   potential by introducing the flow label in the label stack, in which
   ECMP transport discriminates traffic at flow granularity. The large
   flow classification further enables ECMP transport to perform
   different treatments on large flows and small flows, which can
   improve the load balance when flow bit rates vary substantially.

   The method described in this document requires the new capability in
   the PSN and applies to packet switched routers. It requires ingress
   PE to perform the large flow recognition and inserts a large flow
   indication on the flow label; and ECMP process on P or PE routers

Internet-Draft                 LFC-FAT                        July 2010


   perform the different treatments on large flow and small flow
   packets. Each router node performs ECMP function independently, a
   packet switched network can work well even when some nodes support
   the enhanced ECMP capability and some do not. Note: P nodes without
   different treatment capability remain the same level load balance
   performance as before. This lets operator to gradually upgrade the
   network.

6.1. Link Aggregation Groups

   A Link Aggregation Group (LAG) is used to group several physical
   links together between two adjacent nodes so they appear to higher-
   layer protocols as a single, higher bandwidth ''virtual'' pipe. These
   may co-exist in various parts of a given network. The large flow
   classification proposed in this document can facilitate flow
   distribution in LAG.

6.2. The Single Large Flow Case

   [FAT-PW] has suggested several options for the single large flow in
   a PW. With the enhanced ECMP capability, it has beneficial to insert
   a flow label even there is one single large flow in a PW. Then
   ingress PE can insert a large flow indication. P routers in PSN can
   treat this PW as a large flow. In this case, the control plane does
   not need to determine which ECMP path for this PW/LSP.

6.3. Multi-Segment Pseudowires

   The flow label mechanism described in this document works on multi-
   segment PWs [MS-PW] without requiring any modification to the
   Switched PEs (S-PEs). This is because the flow label is transparent
   to the label swap operation. There is no need to perform Large Flow
   Recognition at Switched PEs.

6.4. IP Flows

   Today's ECMP process applies to both IP flows and MPLS labeled
   traffic in PSN. Typically, Hash method uses IP source and
   destination address pair plus other elements to discriminate IP
   flows and distribute them over ECMP paths. If PE can insert a large
   flow indication in the packets of IP flows, the proposed method can
   apply to IP flows as well. IPv6 protocol [RFC2460] already has the
   flow label field. [RFC3697] describes flow label specification.
   Source address and Flow Label can be used in ECMP process. The
   method proposed here meets the restriction on the flow label. [FLOW-
   ECMP] IETF just needs to specify one bit in TC field (8 bits) for
   large flow classification. [LFC-IPv6] By default, all TC bits are


Yong                    Expires December 2011                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                 LFC-FAT                        July 2010


   set as 0 [RFC2460], which is compatible to this solution. P nodes in
   PSN can easily differentiate IPv6 packets and check if the flow
   label is used or not. Although IPv4 protocol does not have such flow
   label, IETF can decide if it is necessary to improve IPv4 protocol
   to have the large flow classification or just wait the time for IPv6
   to take over. The IP large flow recognition and indication is
   outside the scope of this document.

   The Packet Separation Process in the enhanced ECMP uses the first
   nibble to differentiate IP flows and non IP flows before evaluating
   the large flow indication. When PSN does not support large IP flow
   classification, the enhanced ECMP treats all IP flows as small
   flows.

6.5. LSP with Entropy Label

   Entropy Label [Entropy] is inserted in LSP traffic at ingress LSR to
   gain better ECMP load balancing at transit LSRs. The purpose of
   Entropy Label is the same as PW flow label and is used to
   differentiate ''microflow'' within a LSP for ECMP process. Enhanced
   ECMP and Large Flow Classification can apply to LSP with entropy
   label. Traffic class field in the Entropy can use the same semantics
   as PW flow label described in this document. If ingress LSR does not
   support large flow recognition, then it SHOULD set Large Flow
   Classification bit to 0. Entropy Label TTL value is set to 0. LSP
   with Entropy Label has beneficial to apply L3VPN services, in which
   entropy label represents one or a group recognized IP flows.

   The same approach applies to Application Label [RFC4928] as well.

7. Security Considerations

   IANA is for the further study.

Appendix A.                 Enhanced ECMP Example

   Label switched routers can implement the enhanced ECMP for
   distributing flows over ECMP paths. The enhanced ECMP process
   separates the packets that belong to a large flow from the packets
   that belong to a small flow and applies different treatments on
   these two types of packets. The process uses hashing to select ECMP
   paths for all the small flow packets and uses a large flow table to
   select the path for all the large flow packets. Figure 3 illustrates
   the enhanced ECMP processing diagram.

                Figure 3 Enhanced ECMP Process Diagram

   Figure 3 depicts three function elements. There are four equal cost
   paths shown as an example. Small-Flow Forwarding Process is used for
   forwarding all the small flow packets, which can be the same as
   existing ECMP process. Packet Separation Process and Larger-Flow
   Forwarding Process are the new elements in the enhanced ECMP
   proposed in this document.

   The Packet Separation Process receives all the transported packets
   and evaluates all the income packets; it uses the first nibble to
   distinguish labeled packets or IP packets. Following is the
   algorithm for the packet separation process.

   If the first nibble on the packet header == 0 or 1 then

      // Labeled Packet

      Find the bottom label

      If TTL of the bottom label on the packet == 0 then

        // Flow Label packet

        If Large Flow Classification bit == 1 then

           Send packet to large-flow forwarding process

        Else

           Send packet to small-flow forwarding process

        End If

      Else

        // non-flow-labeled packet

        Send the packet to small-flow forwarding process

        // option: operator may want to apply large-flow forwarding
   process to it

      End If

   Else If the first nibble on the packet header == 0x6

      // IPv6 packet

      If Large Flow Classification bit == 1 then

        Send the packet to large-flow forwarding process

      Else

        Send the packet to small-flow forwarding process

      End If

   Else // Ipv4 packet

      Send to small-flow forwarding process

   End If

   Large-Flow Forwarding Process uses a flow table for packet
   forwarding. The flow table has an entry for each ''live'' flow. When
   the process receives a packet, it retrieves the flow ID from the
   packet and performs the table lookup by using flow ID. It forwards
   the packets to the path indicated in the table. If the process does
   not find an entry that matches the flow ID on a packet, it calls the
   path selection algorithm. The algorithm can select a path for the
   flow, say A, based on current path load, i.e. select the path that
   has least load at the time. Then the process forwards the packet to
   the selected path and inserts a new entry for the flow A in the
   table. The following packets of flow A will be forwarded to the path
   indicated in the table. When a flow is transported completely, the
   process no longer receives the packets that belong to the flow; the
   age function in the process can delete the flow entry from the
   table, which prevents the table size from the unnecessary growth.
   The age process frequency is configurable based on operation needs.
   If one of ECMP paths is down the algorithm will map impacted large
   flows to other ECMP paths. If a new ECMP path is added, the new
   flows can be assigned to the new path; it is optional for the
   process to perform the ''live'' large flow reassignment since the
   ''live'' flows may disappear itself anyway. The design method of
   Large-Flow Forwarding Process is outside the scope of this document.

   Besides above example, another example is to split ECMP paths into
   two groups, and have one group for small flows and one for large
   flows; use hash for small flows and round robin for the large flows.
   Other implementation are possible as well.

10.1. Congestion Control

   The enhanced ECMP also brings an advance in congestion control. The
   congestion happens when the traffic volume exceeds the path load
   threshold configured by operators. Since the large flows contribute
   much more volume than small flows, changing few large flows can
   efficiently rescue the congestion condition and keep the rest of
   services running normally. As a result, the congestion control only
   impacts few services. Large-Flow Process can easily select the large
   flows and send them to other paths or block them during the
   congestion. Flow QoS can be considered in the selection process.
   Notes: flow QoS indication is encoded on the top label of the label
   stack. Whether it is worth to cache these blocked flows or not is
   for further study.

10.2. Flow Rate Difference

   The enhanced ECMP method uses the different treatments between large
   flows and small flows. Neither of treatments considers individual

   flow rates in the routing process. This is because that improved
   load balance is achieved by hashing on the small flows and selecting
   the least loaded path for a new ''live'' flow. The latter distribution
   using few large flows effectively compensates the uneven balance
   caused by the hashing and it does not need to consider individual
   flow rate. This is nice for the enhanced ECMP to keep the nature of
   statistical balancing. Therefore, the enhanced ECMP method works
   well even flow rates are not balanced.

10.3. Backward Compatibility

   The method fully supports backward compatibility in PSN. If ingress
   PE does not support Large Flow Recognition, it SHALL set large flow
   indication bit as 0. Then all the flows are treated as small flows
   in PSN. P routers with existing ECMP or enhanced ECMP capability use
   hashing to discriminate the flows and distribute those flows over
   ECMP paths. If ingress PE supports Large Flow Recognition, it will
   insert the indication on the flow label. The P routers with existing
   ECMP capability will ignore the indication and just perform hashing
   on all the flows. The P routers with enhanced ECMP capability will
   separate the large and small flows and perform different treatments
   as proposed in this document. Although P router with existing ECMP
   capability gets uneven load balancing over its ECMP paths, it
   maintains the same performance as today's network. If ingress PE
   does not support the flow label on PW, when enhanced ECMP applies,
   it will treat PW packets or LSP packets as small flow packets.

Appendix B.                 Simulation Analysis

   We create Internet Traffic Generator based on observed Internet
   Traffic pattern. The generator randomly generates 98% of small
   traffic flows and 2% of large traffic flows up to 10G traffic.
   The traffic volume for the large flows and small flows are 30%
   and 70%.  Simulator uses hash based distribution to disperse the
   traffic over 4 paths and 10 paths, respectively; and also uses
   enhanced ECMP method to disperse the traffic over 4 paths and 10
   paths. The results show the performance between ECMP and enhanced
   ECMP from 6 simulations. Enhanced ECMP gets <1% load differences
   among paths while ECMP have up to 15% load differences. It shows
   how the simple distribution on few large flows can effectively
   compensate the uneven load balance caused by hashing and the
   traffic pattern.

   We also use carrier suggested traffic matrix for the simulation,
   the improvement even better because carrier network has some
   significant high bit rate flows whose rate is much higher than
   the rate generated by any application.

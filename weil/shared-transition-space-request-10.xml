    <abstract>
      <t>This document requests the allocation of an IPv4 /10 address block to
      be used as Shared Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGN) Space.
      Service Providers will use Shared CGN Space to number the interfaces
      that connect CGN devices to Customer Premise Equipment (CPE). As this
      document proposes the allocation of an additional special-use IPv4
      address block, it updates RFC 5735.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv4 address space is nearly exhausted. However, ISPs must continue
      to support IPv4 growth until IPv6 is fully deployed. To that end, many
      ISPs will deploy Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) such as that described in <xref
      target="RFC6264"></xref>. In order to effectively deploy CGN, ISPs
      require a new IPv4 /10 address block. This address block will be called
      the Shared CGN Space and will be used to number the interfaces that
      connect CGN devices to CPE.</t>

      <t>Shared CGN Space is distinct from <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>
      address space. Like <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> space, Shared CGN
      Space must be unique to the network but need not be globally unique.
      Unlike <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> address space, Shared CGN Space is
      not available for any purpose other than numbering the interfaces that
      connect a CGN to CPE.</t>

      <t>This document requests the allocation of an IPv4 /10 address block to
      be used as Shared Carrier Grade Network (CGN) Space. In conversations
      with many ISPs, a /10 is the smallest block that will allow them to
      deploy CGNs on a regional basis without requiring nested CGNs. For
      Instance, as described in <xref
      target="I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr"></xref>, a /10 is sufficient to
      service Points of Presence in the Tokyo area.</t>

      <t>As this document proposes the allocation of an additional special-use
      IPv4 address block, it updates <xref target="RFC5735"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Alternatives to Shared CGN Space">
      <t>The interfaces that connect CGN devices to CPE might conceivably be
      numbered from any of the following address spaces: <list style="symbols">
          <t>legitimately assigned globally unique address space</t>

          <t>usurped globally unique address space (i.e., squat space)</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC1918"></xref> space</t>

          <t>Shared CGN Space</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A Service Provider can number the interfaces in question from
      legitimately assigned globally unique address space. While this solution
      poses the fewest problems, it is impractical because globally unique
      IPv4 address space is in short supply. While the Regional Internet
      Registries (RIR) have enough address space to allocate a single /10 to
      be shared by all Service Providers, they do not have enough address
      space to make a unique assignment to each Service Provider.</t>

      <t>Service Providers MUST NOT number the interfaces in question from
      usurped globally unique address space (i.e., squat space). If a Service
      Provider leaks advertisements for squat space into the global Internet,
      the legitimate owners of that address space may be adversely impacted,
      as would those wishing to communicate with them. Even if the Service
      Provider did not leak advertisements for squat space, the Service
      Provider and its subscribers might lose connectivity to the legitimate
      owner of that address space.</t>

      <t>A Service Provider can number the interfaces in question from <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> space if either of the following conditions are
      true: <list style="symbols">
          <t>The Service Provider knows that the CPE/NAT works correctly when
          the same <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> address block is used both
          on its inside and outside interfaces.</t>

          <t>The Service Provider knows that the <xref
          target="RFC1918"></xref> address block that it uses to number
          interfaces between the CGN and CPE is not used on the subscriber
          side of the CPE.</t>
        </list>Unless at least one of the conditions above is true, the
      Service Provider cannot safely use <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>
      address space and must resort to Shared CGN Space. This is typically the
      case in an unmanaged service, where subscribers provide their own CPE
      and number their own internal network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use of Shared CGN Space">
      <t>Shared CGN Space is IPv4 address space reserved for Service Provider
      use with the purpose of facilitating CGN deployment. Specifically:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Shared CGN Space MUST NOT be utilized for any purpose other than
          as "inside" addresses in a CGN environment (e.g., between the CGN
          and CPE).</t>

          <t>Network equipment manufacturers MUST NOT use Shared CGN Space in
          default or example device configurations.</t>

          <t>Shared CGN Space MUST NOT be used on the customer premise side of
          a subscriber NAT device.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Because Shared CGN Space addresses have no meaning outside of the
      Service Provider, routing information about Shared CGN Space networks
      MUST NOT be propagated across Service Provider boundaries. Service
      Providers MUST filter incoming advertisements regarding Shared CGN
      Space. One exception to the above proscription against exchanging routes
      for Shared CGN Space is in the case of a defined business relationship
      between two Service Providers (e.g., for hosted CGN service).</t>

      <t>Packets with Shared CGN Space source or destination addresses MUST
      NOT be forwarded across Service Provider boundaries. Service Providers
      MUST filter such packets on ingress links. As above, one exception to
      the above proscriptions is in the case of business relationships such as
      hosted CGN service.</t>

      <t>When running a single DNS infrastructure, Service Providers MUST NOT
      include Shared CGN Space in zone files. When running a split DNS
      infrastructure, Service Providers MUST NOT include Shared CGN Space in
      external-facing zone files.</t>

      <t>Reverse DNS queries for Shared CGN Space addresses MUST NOT be
      forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure. DNS Providers SHOULD filter
      requests for Shared CGN Space reverse DNS queries on recursive
      nameservers. This is done to avoid having to set up something similar to
      AS112.net for RFC 1918 private address space that a host has incorrectly
      sent for a DNS reverse-mapping queries on the public Internet <xref
      target="RFC6304"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Because CGN service requires non-overlapping address space on each
      side of the home NAT and CGN, entities misusing Shared CGN Space for
      purposes other than for CGN service, as described in this document, are
      likely to experience problems implementing or connecting to CGN service
      at such time as they exhaust their supply of public IPv4 addresses.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Risk">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Analysis">
        <t>Some existing applications discover the outside address of their
        local CPE, determine whether the address is reserved for special-use,
        and behave differently based on that determination. If a new IPv4
        address block is reserved for special-use and that block is used to
        number CPE outside interfaces, some of the above-mentioned
        applications may fail.</t>

        <t>For example, assume that an application requires its peer (or some
        other device) to initiate an incoming connection directly with its CPE
        outside address. That application discovers the outside address of its
        CPE and determines whether that address is reserved for special-use.
        If the address is reserved for special-use, the application rightly
        concludes the that address is not reachable from the global Internet
        and behaves in one manner. If the address is not reserved for
        special-use, the application assumes that the address is reachable
        from the global Internet and behaves in another manner.</t>

        <t>While the assumption that a non-special-use address is reachable
        from the global Internet is generally safe, it is not always true
        (e.g., when the CPE outside interface is numbered from globally unique
        address space but that address is not advertised to the global
        Internet as when it is behind a CGN). Such an assumption could cause
        certain applications to behave incorrectly in those cases.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Empirical Data">
        <t>As described in <xref target="RFC6269"></xref> and <xref
        target="I-D.donley-nat444-impacts"></xref>, CGNs offer a reasonable
        quality of experience for many basic services including web, email,
        and Instant Messaging. This is true regardless of whether the address
        range between the CGN and CPE is globally unique, Shared CGN Space, or
        <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> space. However, CGNs do adversely
        impact some advanced services, in particular:<list style="numbers">
            <t>Console gaming &ndash; some games fail when two subscribers
            using the same outside public IPv4 address try to connect to each
            other.</t>

            <t>Video streaming &ndash; performance is impacted when using one
            of several popular video streaming technologies to deliver
            multiple video streams to users behind particular CPE routers.</t>

            <t>Peer-to-peer &ndash; some peer-to-peer applications cannot seed
            content due to the inability to open incoming ports through the
            CGN. Likewise, some SIP client implementations cannot receive
            incoming calls unless they first initiate outgoing traffic or open
            an incoming port through the CGN using <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref> or similar mechanism.</t>

            <t>Geo-location - geo-location systems identify the location of
            the CGN server, not the end host.</t>

            <t>Simultaneous logins - some websites (particularly banking and
            social networking websites) restrict the number of simultaneous
            logins per outside public IPv4 address.</t>

            <t>6to4 - 6to4 requires globally reachable addresses, and will not
            work in networks that employ addresses with limited topological
            span such as those employing CGNs.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Based on testing documented in <xref
        target="I-D.donley-nat444-impacts"></xref>, the CGN impacts on 1-5 are
        comparable regardless of whether globally unique, Shared CGN Space, or
        <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> addresses are used. There is, however,
        a difference between the three alternatives in the treatment of
        6to4.</t>

        <t>As described in <xref target="RFC6343"></xref>, CPE routers do not
        attempt to initialize 6to4 tunnels when they are configured with <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> or <xref target="RFC5735"></xref> WAN
        addresses. When configured with globally unique or Shared CGN Space
        addresses, such devices may attempt to initiate 6to4, which would
        fail. Service Providers can mitigate this issue using 6to4-PMT <xref
        target="I-D.kuarsingh-v6ops-6to4-provider-managed-tunnel"></xref> or
        blocking the route to 192.88.99.1 and generating an IPv4 'destination
        unreachable' message <xref target="RFC6343"></xref>. When the address
        range is well-defined, as with Shared CGN Space, CPE router vendors
        can include Shared CGN Space in their list of special-use addresses
        (e.g., <xref target="RFC5735"></xref>) and treat Shared CGN Space
        similarly to <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> space. When the CGN-CPE
        address range is not well-defined, as in the case of globally unique
        space, it will be more difficult for CPE router vendors to mitigate
        against this issue.</t>

        <t>Thus, when comparing the use of <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> and
        Shared CGN Space, Shared CGN Space poses an additional impact on 6to4
        connectivity, which can be mitigated by Service Provider or CPE router
        vendor action. On the other hand, the use of <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> address space poses more of a challenge
        vis-a-vis Shared CGN Space when the subscriber and Service Provider
        use overlapping <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> space, which will be
        outside the Service Provider's control in the case of unmanaged
        service. Service Providers have indicated that it is more challenging
        to mitigate the possibility of overlapping <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> address space on both sides of the CPE router
        than it is to mitigate the 6to4 impacts of Shared CGN Space.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Similar to other <xref target="RFC5735"></xref> special use IPv4
      addresses, Shared CGN Space does not directly raise security issues.
      However, the Internet does not inherently protect against abuse of these
      addresses. Attacks have been mounted that depend on the unexpected use
      of similar special-use addresses. Network operators are encouraged to
      review this document and determine what security policies should be
      associated with this address block within their specific operating
      environments and should consider including Shared CGN Space in Ingress
      Filter lists <xref target="RFC3704"></xref> unless their Internet
      service incorporates a CGN.</t>

      <t>To mitigate against potential misuse of Shared CGN Space, except
      where required for hosted CGN service or similar business relationship,
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Routing information about Shared CGN Space networks MUST NOT be
          propagated across Service Provider boundaries. Service Providers

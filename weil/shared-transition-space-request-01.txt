Internet-Draft       Shared Transition Space Request       November 2010


1.  Introduction

   Many operators are currently implimenting their IPv6 transition
   plans.  During the transition, continued support for heritage IPv4
   only devices will be required.  While most operators are well aware
   of the limitations of NAT444 [I-D.shirasaki-nat444] (see
   [I-D.donley-nat444-impacts]), it is the transition mechnism that has
   the least customer impact for many carriers.

   To deal with some of the NAT444 limitations, it becomes necessary for
   a provider to utilize address space in the NAT444 infrastructure that
   will not conflict with it's customer space.

   This document requests that IANA reserve a portion of the remaining
   unallocated space as Shared Transition Space for the enablement of a
   clean transition strategy in provider networks.

3.  Motivation

   The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of
   unallocated IPv4 addresses.  During the transition period to IPv6, it
   is imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for
   devices and networks that are currently incapable of upgrading to
   IPv6.

   In order to provide IPv4 service to customers and/or devices once the
   IPv4 address space is exhausted, Service Providers must multiplex
   several subscribers behind a single IPv4 address using one of several
   techniques including NAT444 .  Providers need sufficient non-
   [RFC1918] address space to deploy such technologies and avoid overlap
   with customer use of private address space.

   Many CPE router devices used to provide residential or small-medium
   business services have been optimized for IPv4 operation, and
   typically require replacement in order to fully support the
   transition to IPv6 (either natively or via one of many transition
   technologies).  In addition, various consumer devices including IP-
   enabled televisions, gaming consoles, medical and family monitoring
   devices, etc. are IPv4-only, and cannot be upgraded.  While these
   will eventually be replaced with dual-stack or IPv6 capable devices,
   this transition will take many years.  As these are typically
   consumer-owned devices, service providers do not have control over
   the speed of their replacement cycle.  However, consumers have an
   expectation that they will continue to receive IPv4 service, and that
   such devices will continue to have IPv4 Internet connectivity after
   the IPv4 pool is exhausted, even if the customer contracts for new
   service with a new provider.

   Until such customers replace their Home Gateways and all IPv4-only
   CPE devices with IPv6-capable devices, Service Providers will be
   required to continue to offer IPv4 services through the use of an
   IPv4 address sharing technology such as NAT444
   [I-D.shirasaki-nat444].  The challenges associated with these
   deployments are identified in [I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr],
   [I-D.donley-nat444-impacts], and
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues].

   Addressing solutions for dealing with the depletion of the IPv4
   public address space and the lack of available private addresses
   within large providers are presented in
   [I-D.azinger-additional-private-ipv4-space-issues] as well as
   [I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr].  For infrastructure providers
   whose customers are already using [RFC1918] space, the preferred
   method for addressing the problems presented in both documents is to
   direct IANA to reserve address space from its unassigned IPv4 address

4.  Shared Transition Space

   This document proposes the assignment of the equivalent of a /10 as
   Shared Transition Space.  This block could be composed of one
   contiguous assignment, or several discontiguous assignments.  Shared
   Transition Space is IPv4 address space reserved for Infrastructure
   provider use with the purpose of facilitating IPv6 transition and
   IPv4 coexistence deployment.  The requested block SHOULD NOT be
   utilized for any purpose other than IPv4 to IPv6 transition
   infrastructure.  Network equipment manufacturers MUST NOT use the
   assigned block in default or example device configurations.

   Because Shared Transition addresses have no meaning outside of the
   Infrastructure Provider, routing information about shared transition
   space networks MUST NOT be propagated on interdomain links, and
   packets with shared transition source or destination addresses SHOULD
   NOT be forwarded across such links.  Internet service providers
   SHOULD filter out routing information about shared transition space
   networks on ingress links.

5.  Problems using Future Use Space

   [I-D.fuller-240space] and [I-D.wilson-class-e] suggest that
   240.0.0.0/4 space could be used as Shared Transition Space.  However,
   as discussed in [I-D.azinger-additional-private-ipv4-space-issues],
   some existing network equipment does not support addresses in the
   240.0.0.0/4 range.  In particular, [CISCO] states that "no addresses
   are allowed with the highest-order bits set to 1111".  It is likely
   that many home routers will not support this range, either.  In order
   to use this range, equipment vendors would need to update software
   code for existing routers and end users would need to upgrade their
   home devices.  As many older home routers do not support automatic
   updates, it is unlikely that enough end users would upgrade to make
   the 240.0.0.0/4 range viable for Shared Transition Space use.

6.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not define any protocol, and raises no security
   issues.  Any addresses allocated as Shared Transition Space would not
   be routable on the Internet.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to reserve an IPv4 /10 from its remaining pool of
   unallocated IPv4 addresses for use as Shared Transition Space.

INTERNET-DRAFT       RADIUS Attributes for IEEE 802      25 October 2009


1.  Introduction

   In situations where it is desirable to centrally manage
   authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) for IEEE 802
   [IEEE-802] networks, deployment of a backend authentication and
   accounting server is desirable.  In such situations, it is expected
   that IEEE 802 authenticators will function as AAA clients.

   "IEEE 802.1X Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
   Usage Guidelines" [RFC3580] defined guidelines for the use of the
   Remote Authentication Dialin User Service (RADIUS) within networks
   utilizing IEEE 802 local area networks.  This document defines
   additional attributes suitable for usage by IEEE 802 authenticators
   acting as AAA clients.  The attributes defined in this document are
   usable both within RADIUS and Diameter.

1.1.  Terminology

This document uses the following terms:

Access Point (AP)
               A Station that provides access to the distribution
               services via the wireless medium for associated Stations.

Association    The service used to establish Access Point/Station
               mapping and enable Station invocation of the distribution
               system services.

authenticator  An authenticator is an entity that require authentication
               from the supplicant.  The authenticator may be connected
               to the supplicant at the other end of a point-to-point
               LAN segment or wireless link.

authentication server
               An authentication server is an entity that provides an
               authentication service to an authenticator.  This service
               verifies from the credentials provided by the supplicant,
               the claim of identity made by the supplicant.

Station (STA)  Any device that contains an IEEE 802.11 conformant medium
               access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) interface
               to the wireless medium (WM).

Supplicant     A supplicant is an entity that is being authenticated by
               an authenticator.  The supplicant may be connected to the
               authenticator at one end of a point-to-point LAN segment
               or 802.11 wireless link.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  RADIUS attributes

2.1.  Allowed-Called-Station-Id

   Description

      The Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute allows the RADIUS server
      to specify the authenticator MAC addresses and/or networks to
      which the user is allowed to connect.  One or more Allowed-Called-
      Station-Id attributes MAY be included in an Access-Accept or CoA-
      Request packet.

      A summary of the Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute format is
      shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |  Length       |            String...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Code

      TBD1

   Length

      >=3

   String

      The String field is one or more octets, containing the layer 2
      endpoint that the user's call is allowed to be terminated on, as
      specified in the definition of Called-Station-Id in [RFC2865]
      Section 5.30 and [RFC3580] Section 3.20.  In the case of IEEE 802,
      the Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute is used to store the
      Medium Access Control (MAC) address in ASCII format (upper case
      only), with octet values separated by a "-".  Example:
      "00-10-A4-23-19-C0".  Where restrictions on both the network and
      authenticator MAC address usage are intended, the network name

INTERNET-DRAFT       RADIUS Attributes for IEEE 802      25 October 2009


      MUST be appended to the authenticator MAC address, separated from
      the MAC address with a ":".  Example: "00-10-A4-23-19-C0:AP1".
      Where no MAC address restriction is intended, the MAC address
      field MUST be omitted, but the network name field MUST be
      included.  Example: "AP1".  Within IEEE 802.11 [IEEE-802.11], the
      SSID constitutes the network name; within IEEE 802.1X-REV
      [IEEE-802.1X-REV], the Network-Id Name (NID-Name) constitutes the
      network name.  Since a NID-Name can be up to 253 octets in length,
      when used with [IEEE-802.1X-REV], there may not be sufficient room
      within the Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute to include a MAC
      address.

      If the user attempts to connect to the NAS from a Called-Station-
      Id that does not match one of the Allowed-Called-Station-Id
      attributes, then the user MUST NOT be permitted to access the
      network.

      The Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute can be useful in the
      following situations:

[1]     Where users can connect to a NAS without an Access-Request being
        sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server (e.g. where key caching is
        supported within IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.1X-REV [IEEE-802.1X-
        REV]).  To avoid elevation of privilege attacks, key cache
        entries are typically only usable within the network to which
        the user originally authenticated (e.g. the originally selected
        network name is implicitly attached to the key cache entry).
        Also, if it is desired that access to a network name not be
        available from a particular authenticator MAC address, then the
        authenticator can be set up not to advertise that particular
        network name.

[2]     Where pre-authentication may be supported (e.g.  IEEE 802.1X
        pre-authentication).  In this situation, the network name
        typically will not be included in a Called-Station-Id Attribute
        within the Access-Request, so that the RADIUS server will not
        know the network that the user is attempting to access.  As a
        result, the RADIUS server may desire to restrict the networks to
        which the user can subsequently connect.

[3]     Where the network portion of the Called-Station-Id is present
        within an Access-Request, the RADIUS server can desire to
        authorize access to a network different from the one that the
        user selected.

2.2.  EAP-Key-Name

   Description

      The EAP-Key-Name Attribute, defined in "Diameter Extensible
      Authentication Protocol (EAP) Application" [RFC4072], contains the
      EAP Session-Id, as described in "Extensible Authentication
      Protocol (EAP) Key Management Framework" [RFC5247].  Exactly how
      this Attribute is used depends on the link layer in question.

      It should be noted that not all link layers use this name and
      existing EAP method implementations do not generate it.  An EAP-
      Key-Name Attribute MAY be included within Access-Request, Access-
      Accept and CoA-Request packets.  A summary of the EAP-Key-Name
      Attribute format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted from
      left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |  Length       |          String...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Code

      102 [RFC4072]

   Length

      >=3

   String

      The String field is one or more octets, containing the EAP
      Session-Id, as defined in "Extensible Authentication Protocol
      (EAP) Key Management Framework" [RFC5247].  Since the NAS operates
      as a pass-through in EAP, it cannot know the EAP Session-Id before
      receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As a result, an EAP-Key-Name
      Attribute sent in an Access-Request MUST only contain a single NUL
      character.  A RADIUS server receiving an Access-Request with an
      EAP-Key-Name Attribute containing anything other than a single NUL
      character MUST silently discard the Attribute.  In addition, the
      RADIUS server SHOULD include this Attribute in an Access-Accept or
      CoA-Request only if an EAP-Key-Name Attribute was present in the
      Access-Request.

2.3.  EAP-Peer-Id

   Description

      The EAP-Peer-Id Attribute contains a Peer-Id generated by the EAP
      method.  Exactly how this name is used depends on the link layer
      in question.  See [RFC5247] for more discussion.  The EAP-Peer-Id
      Attribute MAY be included in Access-Request, Access-Accept and
      Accounting-Request packets.  More than one EAP-Peer-Id Attribute
      MUST NOT be included in an Access-Request; one or more EAP-Peer-Id
      attributes MAY be included in an Access-Accept.

      It should be noted that not all link layers use this name, and
      existing EAP method implementations do not generate it.  Since the
      NAS operates as a pass-through in EAP [RFC3748], it cannot know
      the EAP-Peer-Id before receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As a
      result, an EAP-Peer-Id Attribute sent in an Access-Request MUST
      only contain a single NUL character.  A home RADIUS server
      receiving an Access-Request an EAP-Peer-Id Attribute containing
      anything other than a single NUL character MUST silently discard
      the Attribute.  In addition, the home RADIUS server SHOULD include
      one or more EAP-Peer-Id attributes in an Access-Accept only if an
      EAP-Peer-Id Attribute was present in the Access-Request.  A
      summary of the EAP-Peer-Id Attribute format is shown below.  The
      fields are transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3

      The String field is one or more octets containing a EAP Peer-Id
      exported by the EAP method.  For details, see [RFC5247] Appendix
      A.  A robust implementation SHOULD support the field as
      undistinguished octets.

2.4.  EAP-Server-Id

   Description

      The EAP-Server-Id Attribute contains a Server-Id generated by the
      EAP method.  Exactly how this name is used depends on the link
      layer in question.  See [RFC5247] for more discussion.  The EAP-
      Server-Id Attribute is only allowed in Access-Request, Access-
      Accept, and Accounting-Request packets.  More than one EAP-Server-
      Id Attribute MUST NOT be included in an Access-Request; one or
      more EAP-Server-Id attributes MAY be included in an Access-Accept.

      It should be noted that not all link layers use this name, and
      existing EAP method implementations do not generate it.  Since the
      NAS operates as a pass-through in EAP [RFC3748], it cannot know
      the EAP-Server-Id before receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As
      a result, an EAP-Server-Id Attribute sent in an Access-Request
      MUST contain only a single NUL character.  A home RADIUS server
      receiving in an Access-Request an EAP-Server-Id Attribute
      containing anything other than a single NUL character MUST
      silently discard the Attribute.  In addition, the home RADIUS
      server SHOULD include this Attribute an Access-Accept only if an
      EAP-Server-Id Attribute was present in the Access-Request.  A
      summary of the EAP-Server-Id Attribute format is shown below.  The
      fields are transmitted from left to right.

2.5.  Mobility-Domain-Id

   Description

      A single Mobility-Domain-Id Attribute MAY be included in an
      Access-Request or Accounting-Request, in order to enable the NAS
      to provide the RADIUS server with the Mobility Domain Identifier
      (MDID), defined in IEEE 802.11r [IEEE-802.11r].  A summary of the
      Mobility-Domain-Id Attribute format is shown below.  The fields
      are transmitted from left to right.

   Value

      The Value field is four octets, containing a 32-bit unsigned
      integer.  Since the Mobility Domain Identifier defined in IEEE
      802.11r [IEEE-802.11r] is only two octets in length, the two most

      ignored by the receiver;  the two least significant octets contain
      the MDID value.

2.6.  Preauth-Timeout

   Description

      This Attribute sets the maximum number of seconds which pre-
      authentication state is required to be kept by the NAS, without
      being utilized within a user session.  For example, when
      [IEEE-802.11] pre-authentication is used, if a user has not
      attempted to utilize the PMK derived as a result of pre-
      authentication within the time specified by the Preauth-Timeout
      Attribute, the PMK MAY be discarded by the Access Point.  However,
      once the session is underway, the Preauth-Timeout Attribute has no

      bearing on the maximum session time for the user, or the maximum
      time during which key state may be kept prior to re-
      authentication.  This is determined by the Session-Timeout
      Attribute, if present.

      This Attribute MAY be sent by the server to the NAS in an Access-
      Accept.  A summary of the Preauth-Timeout Attribute format is

   Description

      This Attribute provides information relating to the lower layer
      over which EAP is transported.  This Attribute MAY be sent by the
      NAS to the RADIUS server in an Access-Request or an Accounting-

2.8.  Network-Id-Name

   Description

      The Network-Id-Name Attribute is utilized by implementations of
      IEEE-802.1X-REV [IEEE-802.1X-REV] to specify the name of a
      Network-Id (NID-Name).

      Unlike the IEEE 802.11 SSID (which is a maximum of 32 octets in
      length), the NID-Name may be up to 253 octets in length.
      Consequently, if the MAC address is included within the Called-
      Station-Id Attribute, it is possible that there will not be enough
      remaining space to encode the NID-Name as well.  Therefore when
      used with IEEE 802.1X-REV, the Called-Station-Id Attribute SHOULD
      contain only the MAC address, with the Network-Id-Name Attribute
      used to transmit the NID-Name.  The Network-Id-Name Attribute
      SHOULD NOT be used to encode the IEEE 802.11 SSID; as noted in
      [RFC3580], the Called-Station-Id Attribute is used for this
      purpose.

      Zero or one Network-Id-Name Attribute is permitted within a RADIUS
      Access-Request or Accounting-Request packet.  When included within

      an Access-Request packet, the Network-Id-Name Attribute represents
      a hint of the NID-Name to which the Supplicant should be granted
      access.  In order to indicate which network names the Supplicant
      is permitted to access, the Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute is
      provided within an Access-Accept.  When included within an
      Accounting-Request packet, the Network-Id-Name Attribute
      represents the NID-Name to which the Supplicant has been granted
      access.

      A summary of the Network-Id-Name Attribute format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      The String field is one or more octets, containing a NID-Name.
      For details, see [IEEE-802.1X-REV].  A robust implementation
      SHOULD support the field as undistinguished octets.

2.9.  Access-Status

   Description

      The Access-Status Attribute is utilized by implementations of
      IEEE-802.1X-REV [IEEE-802.1X-REV] to specify the Status bits
      within an Access Information Type Length Value tuple (TLVs) sent
      to the user within MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) or EAPoL-
      Announcement frames.

      A single Access-Status Attribute is permitted within a RADIUS
      Access-Accept or Accounting-Request packet.

      A summary of the Access-Status Attribute format is shown below.
      The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Value

      The Value field is four octets containing a 32-bit unsigned
      integer.  Since the Access status information field defined in
      [IEEE-802.1X-REV] Section 11.12.2 is only two octets in length,
      the two most significant octets MUST be set to zero by the sender
      and are ignored by the receiver.

3.  Table of attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

     0     This Attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
     0+    Zero or more instances of this Attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.
     0-1   Zero or one instance of this Attribute MAY be
           present in the packet.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   The EAP-Key-Name Attribute is already defined as a RADIUS Attribute
   within Diameter EAP [RFC4072].  When used in Diameter, the other
   attributes defined in this specification can be used as Diameter AVPs
   from the Code space 1-255 (RADIUS Attribute compatibility space).  No
   additional Diameter Code values are therefore allocated.  The data
   types and flag rules for the attributes are as follows:

                                            +---------------------+
                                            |    AVP Flag rules   |
                                            |----+-----+----+-----|----+

   Allowed-Called-                          |    |     |    |     |    |

   EAP-Peer-Id                   UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   EAP-Server-Id                 UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   Mobility-Domain-Id            Unsigned32 |    |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   Preauth-Timeout               Unsigned32 | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   EAP-Lower-Layer               Unsigned32 | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   Network-Id-Name               UTF8String | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   Access-Status                 Unsigned32 | M  |  P  |    |  V  | Y  |
   -----------------------------------------|----+-----+----+-----|----|

   The attributes in this specification have no special translation
   requirements for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS to Diameter gateways;
   they are copied as is, except for changes relating to headers,
   alignment, and padding. See also [RFC3588] Section 4.1 and [RFC4005]
   Section 9.

   What this specification says about the applicability of the
   attributes for RADIUS Access-Request packets applies in Diameter to
   AA-Request [RFC4005] or Diameter-EAP-Request [RFC4072].  What is said

   about Access-Challenge applies in Diameter to AA-Answer [RFC4005] or
   Diameter-EAP-Answer [RFC4072] with Result-Code AVP set to
   DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH.

   What is said about Access-Accept applies in Diameter to AA-Answer or
   Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate success.  Similarly, what
   is said about RADIUS Access-Reject packets applies in Diameter to AA-
   Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer messages that indicate failure.

   What is said about COA-Request applies in Diameter to Re-Auth-Request
   [RFC4005].  What is said about Accounting-Request applies to Diameter
   Accounting- Request [RFC4005] as well.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses the RADIUS [RFC2865] namespace, see
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types>.  This specification
   requires assignment of a RADIUS attribute types for the following
   attributes:

   Attribute                        Type
   =========                        ====
   Allowed-Called-Station-Id        TBD1
   EAP-Peer-Id                      TBD2
   EAP-Server-Id                    TBD3
   Mobility-Domain-Id               TBD4
   Preauth-Timeout                  TBD5
   EAP-Lower-Layer                  TBD6
   Network-Id-Name                  TBD7
   Access-Status                    TBD8

   This specification allocates the following decimal values for the
   EAP-Lower-Layer Attribute:

   1 -  Wired IEEE 802.1X Version 1 (2001)
   2 -  Wired IEEE 802.1X Version 2 (2004) [IEEE-802.1X]
   3 -  Wired IEEE 802.1X Version 3 [IEEE-802.1X-REV]
   4 -  WPA
   5 -  WPA2 (no pre-authentication)
   6 -  WPA2, IEEE 802.1X pre-authentication
   7 -  IEEE 802.11r
   8 -  IEEE 802.11s
   9 -  IEEE 802.16e
   10 - IKEv2
   11 - PPP
   12 - PANA (no pre-authentication)

   Additional values are allocated as described in "IANA Considerations

   for RADIUS" [RFC3575] Section 2.1 (Designated Expert).

6.  Security Considerations

   Since this document describes the use of RADIUS for purposes of
   authentication, authorization, and accounting in IEEE 802 networks,
   it is vulnerable to all of the threats that are present in other
   RADIUS applications.  For a discussion of these threats, see
   [RFC2607], [RFC2865], [RFC3162], [RFC3579], [RFC3580] and [RFC5176].

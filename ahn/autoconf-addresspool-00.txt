Internet-Draft  MANET Address Configuration using Address Pool  Dec 2009


Abstract

   This document describes an address configuration mechanism based on
   the concept of address pool allocation in the connected MANET.
   The Internet gateway acts as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol) server and assigns not a single address but a part of its
   address pool to an address requesting node and, then, the node can
   assign a part of its own address pool to its neighbor nodes.
   By doing this, the address allocation procedure can be expedited.

Internet-Draft  MANET Address Configuration using Address Pool  Dec 2009
        

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The MANET can be classified into the standalone MANET and the
   connected MANET [1]. The conntected MANET allows a MANET node to
   communicate with global Internet nodes via the Internet gateway
   (IGW). In order for a MANET node to communicate with a node in the
   external global Internet, the MANET node has to obtain a globally
   unique IP address. In the wireless multi-hop communication
   environment, the mechanism using the IGW as the centralized DHCP
   (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) [2] server is not desirable
   since it may incur long address allocation delay.
 
   In this draft, we describe an address configuration mechanism that
   allows stable and fast global IP address allocation based on the DHCP
   mechanism in the connected MANET. In the proposed scheme, the IGW
   acts as a DHCP server and allocates a part of its address pool to
   an address requesting node. Now, the node with the allocated address
   pool can act a DHCP server and allocate a part of its address pool
   to the other address requesting nodes.

  
3.  Terminology

   Address Pool     A range of addresses starting from LOW to HIGH.
      

4.  Address Pool based MANET Address Configuration

   The IGW periodically broadcasts Router Advertisement (RA) messages to
   the entire MANET and the MANET node receiving the RA message can
   request for addresses to the IGW by unicasting a DHCP_Request [2]
   message. Any intermediate node receiving the DHCP_Request message
   intercepts the message and allocates a part of its address pool in
   lieu of the IGW if its address pool is big enough to allocate by
   unicasting a DHCP_Reply message to the address requesting node.
   Otherwise, it forwards the DHCP_Request message to the IGW. Once the
   IGW receives the DHCP_Request message, the IGW allocates a part of
   its address pool to the addres requesting node by sending a
   DHCP_Reply message.

   The node with the allocated address pool assigns one address to its
   interface and keeps the rest of its address pool for later

   allocation to other MANET nodes requesting addresses.

   In order to avoid the renewal of the allocated address pool, the
   valid-lifetime field in the DHCP_Reply message is set to
   '0xffffffff' (that is, infinite use of the address pool). If the size
   of the address pool of the IGW reaches below a pre-specified
   threshold, the IGW broadcasts an Address Pool Release Request (APRR)
   message to the entire MANET. The MANET node receiving the APRR
   message sends an Address Pool Release Reply (APRP) message to let
   the IGW know those addresses already being used or assigned by the
   APRP message sent node.


5. Message Format


5.1  Address Pool Release Request (APRR) message

   This message is broadcast by the IGW to the entire MANET in order to
   request for the list of addresses used by MANET nodes.

Internet-Draft       A Reliable MANET Routing Mechanism         Oct 2010


Abstract

   This document describes a reliable MANET routing mechanism based on
   the node mobility detection. To detect the node mobility, each node
   maintains the Neighbor Node table and measures the stability of
   its neighboring environment. Using the route stability information,
   reliabille routing can be achieved.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The MANET routing protocols can be broadly classified into the
   proactive (table-driven) and the reactive (on-demand) routing
   protocols [1]. In general, the reactive routing protocols require
   less overhead than the proactive ones. In the reactive routing
   approach, a broken link is detected from packet delivery failures
   and, in this case, each corresponding source node is notified of
   the link failure so that the source searches for a new path by
   broadcasting a route request message. Because of the strategy of
   selecting the minimum hop path, path recomputation may occur
   frequently in case of high node mobility.
 
   In this draft, we describe a reliable MANET routing mechanism based
   on the node mobility detection. To detect the node mobility, each
   node maintains the Neighbor Node table and measures the stability
   of its neighboring environment. Using the route stability
   information, reliabille routing can be achieved.

  
3.  Terminology

   Neighbor Node table   The table maintained by a node to keep the
                         information on its neighbors.
      

4.  A Mechanism to Detect the Node Mobility

   In the reactive MANET routing protocols, a node broadcasts HELLO
   messages periodically to notify its existence to its one-hop
   neighbors. For the node mobility prediction, we require each node to
   maintain the Neighbor Node (NN) table. The meaning of each field in
   the NN table is given in Table 1.

            <Table 1. Fields of the Neighbor Node (NN) table>

        +------------------------+-------------------------------+
        |        Field           |          Description          |
        +========================+===============================+
        | Neighbor Address       | Address of the neighbor node  |
        +------------------------+-------------------------------+
        |                        | Count of the not-received     |
        | Neighbor Entry Counter | HELLO messages from the       |
        |                        | neighbor                      |
        +------------------------+-------------------------------+
        | Nighbor Table Timer    | Timer                         |
        +------------------------+-------------------------------+

   The number of the NN table entries varies depending on the network
   status (i.e., the receiving status of HELLO messages). In the high
   mobility case, the number of the NN table entries changes more
   dynamically than the low mobility case. Based on this, each node
   computes the changes in the number of its NN table entries and
   predicts the dynamicity of its neighboring environment. Each node
   computes the average number of its NN table entries, E_n, and the
   changes of its NN table entries, V_n, at the n-th time period.

        E_n = W_1 * e_n + (1 - W_1) * e_(n-1)                 (1)
        V_n = W_2 * (e_n - E_n) ^ 2 + (1 - W_2) * V_(n-1)     (2)

   In Eq. (1), e_n is the number of the NN table entries at the n-th
   time period and W_1 is the weight for E_n. In Eq. (2), W_2 is the
   weight for V_n.


5.  A Reliable MANET Routing Mechanism

   A new field, PathVar, is newly defined in the RREQ message, which
   is used to include the largest V_n of the path traversed by the
   RREQ message. Thus, PathVar indicates the stability (i.e., the
   reliability) of the path. On receiving a RREQ message, the node
   compares the PathVar in the RREQ message with that in its routing
   table. If the PathVar in the RREQ message is smaller, the node
   updates its routing according to the RREQ message and forwards
   the RREQ message.


6.  Other Considerations

   TBD.

   BGP Protocol Extensions for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery
                           in a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN

Abstract

   Connectivity between customer sites in an IP Virtual Private Network
   (VPN) supported by BGP/MPLS may be achieved using MPLS Traffic
   Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The paths of these LSPs
   must be computed to provide the end-to-end connectivity desired, and
   the paths selected may depend upon the VPN being served, and the
   location and reachability of target addresses within customer sites.

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a server that can compute the
   paths of TE LSPs in an MPLS network. Where one or more VPNs is
   supported over a core network, different PCEs may serve computations
   for different VPNs.

   PCE discovery allows a Path Computation Client (PCC) to determine
   which PCEs are available to service its computation requests.
   Using an IGP to distribute PCE discovery information for VPN use
   would result in the information being needlessly flooded to all core
   nodes regardless of whether they are aware of the VPN. These nodes do
   not need to be aware of per-VPN PCE function. This document describes
   how BGP can be used to distribute PCE discovery information
   specifically for use in VPN path computation.

1. Introduction

   [RFC4364] documents how a Service Provider could use an IP backbone
   to provide IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to its customers. Each
   VPN contains at least one Customer Edge (CE) router which is attached
   to a Provider Edge (PE) router. It is possible for CE routers to be
   attached to multiple PE routers. BGP [RFC4271] can be used to
   exchange VPN route information between the PE routers.

   [RFC4655] describes the motivations and architecture for a PCE-based
   path computation model for MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this model, path computation requests
   are issued by a Path Computation Client (PCC) to a PCE. If the PCC
   and PCE are not colocated, a request/response communication protocol
   is needed to carry the request and to return the response. The
   requirements for such a communication protocol are described in
   [RFC4657]. The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
   (called PCEP) is defined in [RFC5440].

   When a PCC is not colocated with the PCE, the PCC must determine the
   location of the PCE that will service its requests. As described in
   [RFC4655],  the knowledge of the location of a PCE may be achieved
   through local configuration at the PCC or may rely on a protocol-
   based discovery mechanism.

   [E2E-RSVP-TE] lists requirements for supporting customer Resource
   Reservation Protocol (RSVP) and RSVP-TE over a BGP/MPLS IP VPN.
   Section 5.8 of that document states that a solution should support
   the use of per-VPN PCEs for determining the paths of end-to-end MPLS
   TE LSPs between customer sites.

   Requirements for the use of PCE to support VPNs are discussed in
   [PCE-VPN]. That document notes that there is likely to be a
   correlation between the VPN auto-discovery / membership distribution
   mechanism and the PCE discovery mechanism used for per-VPN PCEs. But
   the document sets PCE discovery as out of scope.

   In a VPN model as described in [E2E-RSVP-TE], CEs or PEs may be PCCs,
   and PEs or Provider (P) core nodes may be PCEs. There may be very
   many VPNs supported by a network and many customer sites within each
   VPN. Furthermore, manual configuration of VPN site information is
   burdensome and error-prone. Therefore, an automated, protocol-based
   solution is desirable for per-VPN PCE discovery.

   [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] describe IGP-based PCE discovery mechanisms.
   These mechanisms are ideal where all or a large percentage of the
   nodes in a network need to know the location of the PCE. However, in
   the case of per-VPN PCEs, it is only the CE and PE nodes that
   participate in support for the specific VPN that need to know the
   location of the PCE that serves that VPN. Furthermore, in a VPN
   environment, the IGP used in the core does not distribute information
   to CE nodes. Therefore, the IGP solutions are not optimal.

   This document leverages the use of BGP in VPNs to additionally
   distribute per-VPN PCE location and capabilities information. A new
   BGP PCE Discovery Attribute is defined and this is carried in the
   Path Attributes of the BGP UPDATE message.

2. PCE Discovery Information

   As defined in [RFC4674], the mandatory PCE discovery information
   consists of:

   - Discovery of PCE Location
     This is an IPv4 and/or an IPv6 address used to reach the PCE.

   - Domain Visibility Information
     The computation domains that the PCE serves must be advertised so
     that PCCs know whether the PCE can satisfy their requests. In the
     context of per-VPN PCEs, the computation domains are the VPNs.

2.1. BGP PCE Discovery Attribute

   The PCE information is carried in the Path Attributes of the UPDATE
   message described in [RFC4271]. The Transitive bit is defined to be
   set as transitive.

   The Attribute Flags are set as follows:

     The Optional bit set to 1 (optional).
     The Transitive bit set to 1 (transitive).
     The Partial bit set to 0 (complete).
     The Extended Length bit set to 1 (2 octets).

   The Attribute Type is to be assigned by IANA. <recommended value=20>

   The Path Attributes will be encoded as < Length, List of TLVs >.

            +---------------------------+
            |   Length (2 octets)       |
            +---------------------------+
            |   List of TLVs (variable) |
            +---------------------------+

   The meaning of the fields is as follows.

   Length :

      The length in bytes of the list of TLVs carried in the Path
      Attribute.

   List of TLVs :

      This contains a list of TLVs each of which can be a BGP PCE
      Discovery TLV.

2.1.1. The BGP PCE Discovery TLV

K. Kumaki, et al.                                               [Page 4]

draft-kumaki-pce-bgp-disco-attribute-06                      March 2010


   The BGP PCE Discovery TLV (PCED TLV) contains a non-ordered set of
   sub-TLVs.

   The BGP PCED TLV is composed of 2 octets for the type, 2 octets
   specifying the length of the value portion in octets, and a value
   field.

   The BGP PCED TLV has the following format:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              Type             |             Length            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   //                           sub-TLVs                          //
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields are as follows:

      Type:     1
      Length:   Variable
      Value:    This comprises one or more sub-TLVs

   One sub-TLV is defined:

        Sub-TLV type   Length       Name
        ------------   --------     --------------------
              1        variable     PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV

   The following sub-section describes the sub-TLVs that may be carried
   within the PCED TLV.

2.1.1.1. PCE-ADDRESS Sub-TLV

   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV specifies an IP address that can be used to
   reach the PCE. It is RECOMMENDED to use an address that is always
   reachable, provided that the PCE is alive and reachable.

   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the
   PCED TLV. It MAY appear more than once, when the PCE has an address
   from more than one address type (i.e., both IPv4 and IPv6). It MUST
   NOT appear more than once for the same address type. If it appears
   more than once for the same address type, only the first occurrence
   is processed and any others MUST be ignored.

draft-kumaki-pce-bgp-disco-attribute-06                      March 2010

   The format of the PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV is as follows:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Type = 1            |             Length            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |         address-type          |            Reserved           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   //                       PCE IP Address                        //
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields are as follows:

      Type:           1
      Length:         8 (IPv4) or 20 (IPv6)
      Address-type:   1   IPv4
                      2   IPv6
      Reserved:       SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
                      ignored on receipt.
      PCE IP Address: The IP address to be used to reach the PCE.

3. Procedures

   The PCE Discovery Attribute can be carried in the Path Attribute of
   BGP UPDATE messages. It can be handled regardless of whether
   IPv4/IPv6 and VPNv4/VPNv6 routes are present in the BGP UPDATE
   messages.

3.1. Transmission Processing

   BGP speakers can advertise the address of a per-VPN PCE at the same
   time as it advertises routes for the VPN. The PCE address is included
   in the Path Attribute of BGP UPDATE message as a BGP PCE Discovery
   Attribute.

   The PCE advertised is associated with the VPN instance to which the
   BGP UPDATE applies. Thus, the mandatory Domain Visibility Information
   noted in Section 2 is distributed implicitly.

   It can be made a configuration choice whether to advertise the PCE
   address or not.

draft-kumaki-pce-bgp-disco-attribute-06                      March 2010


3.1.1. Choice of PCE Address

   If a BGP speaker is PCE capable, the PCE address is an assigned
   address for the BGP speaker itself. It may be a VPN Routing and
   Forwarding (VRF) interface address or a loopback address. If a BGP
   speaker is not PCE capable, the address of the PCE may be decided by
   configuration or any other method; this method is out of scope of
   this document.

3.2. Receiver Processing

   BGP speakers that receive PCE Discovery Attributes store the
   information for use when a PCEP request needs to be sent.

   The PCE advertised is associated with the VPN instance to which the
   BGP UPDATE applies.

3.3. Procedure at Path Computation Request:

   When a router needs a path computed for a particular VPN and the
   router is not able to perform the computation itself, it looks up
   the address of the per-VPN PCE. If no address is found it cannot
   perform the path computation and returns an error. If one or more
   address is found it selects one according to local policy (see
   [RFC4655] and [RFC5440]) and acts as a PCC to send the computation
   request to the PCE according to [RFC5440].

4. Security Considerations

   This document defines BGP extensions for PCE discovery across an
   administrative domain. Hence the security of the PCE discovery relies
   on the security of BGP within a single administrative domain.

   Increased information dissemination with BGP makes the network more
   vulnerable to any attack on BGP. Therefore the use of BGP security
   mechanisms is RECOMMENDED.

   The security issues for BGP are described in [RFC2385].

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry of attribute types for the Path Attribute
   called 'BGP Path Attributes'.

   IANA is requested to assign a new type for the BGP PCE Discovery
   Attribute type defined in Section 2.1 as follows:

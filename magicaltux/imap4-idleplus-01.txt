                        IMAP4 IDLEPLUS extension
                   draft-magicaltux-imap4-idleplus-01

Abstract

   This document describes a new extension for IMAP4 servers.  This new
   extension aims to extend the functions provided by the existing IDLE
   extension (RFC 2177) to better fit needs of current IMAP4 clients by
   allowing monitoring of multiple folders.

   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the author.

Internet-Draft          IMAP4 IDLEPLUS extension               June 2010


1.  Introduction

   Most modern IMAP4rev1 RFC 3501 [RFC3501] clients support so-called
   push-imap way to receive emails in realtime in the form of IMAP IDLE
   RFC 2177 [RFC2177].  Those clients usually want to receive real time
   notification of new emails or deleted emails in more than one imap
   folder, which is not supported by IMAP IDLE.  To workaround this
   limitation, those clients will open one connection per monitored
   folder and cause unneeded load on those servers.

   A typical user will have INBOX, Draft and Sent folders.  This can
   increase dramatically if the user makes use of folders to filter
   mails, causing some users to have up to 30 folders (and idle IMAP
   connections via TCP).

   This draft proposes a new way for IMAP clients to receive change
   notifications on many folders without having to keep many open
   connections to the IMAP server.

1.1.  Conventions

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  IMAP Protocol Changes

   The IDLEPLUS extension is present in any IMAP server implementation
   that returns "IDLEPLUS" as one of the supported capabilities to the
   CAPABILITY command.

   The IDLEPLUS extension defines an additional command.


3.  Specifications

3.1.  IDLEPLUS Command

Internet-Draft          IMAP4 IDLEPLUS extension               June 2010


   Arguments:      none

   Responses:      continuation data will be requested; the client sends
                   the continuation data "DONE" to end the command

   Result:

                   OK  IDLE completed after client sent "DONE"

                   NO  failure: the server will not allow the IDLEPLUS
                       command at this time

                   BAD command unknown or arguments invalid

   The IDLEPLUS command may be used with any IMAP4 server implementation
   that returns "IDLEPLUS" as one of the supported capabilities to the
   CAPABILITY command.  If the server does not advertise the IDLEPLUS
   capability, the client MUST NOT use the IDLEPLUS command and may
   either poll for mailbox updates or connect multiple times to the IMAP
   server and use IDLE command from RFC 2177 [RFC2177].  In particular,
   the client MUST continue to be able to accept unsolicited untagged
   responses to ANY command, as specified in the base IMAP
   specification.

   The IDLEPLUS command is sent from the client to the server when the
   client is ready to accept unsolicited mailbox update messages.  The
   server requests a response to the IDLE command using the continuation
   ("+") response.  The IDLE command remains active until the client
   responds to the continuation, and as long as an IDLE command is
   active, the server is now free to send untagged EXISTS, EXPUNGE, and
   other messages at any time.

   Untagged responses by IDLEPLUS are slightly different from those
   expected by calls to IDLE.  Those are detailed in IDLEPLUS Responses
   (Section 3.2).

   The IDLEPLUS command is terminated by the receipt of a "DONE"
   continuation from the client; such response satisfies the server's
   continuation request.  At that point, the server MAY send any
   remaining queued untagged responses and then MUST immediately send
   the tagged response to the IDLEPLUS command and prepare to process
   other commands.  As in the base specification, the processing of any
   new command may cause the sending of unsolicited untagged responses,
   subject to the ambiguity limitations.  The client MUST NOT send a
   command while the server is waiting for the DONE, since the server
   will not be able to distinguish a command from a continuation.

   The server MAY consider a client inactive if it has an IDLEPLUS

   command running, and if such a server has an inactivity timeout it
   MAY log the client off implicitly at the end of its timeout period.
   Because of that, clients using IDLEPLUS are advised to terminate the
   IDLEPLUS and re-issue it at least every 29 minutes to avoid being
   logged off.  This still allows a client to receive immediate mailbox
   updates even though it need only "poll" at half hour intervals.

3.2.  IDLEPLUS Responses

   When in IDLEPLUS mode the server will send different kinds of
   untagged responses to the client.  Each untagged response is made of
   the message UID, the response type and the folder in which the
   message is stored.  The mailbox name MUST NOT contain 8bit
   characters.  Mailbox names containing non-ASCII characters should be
   encoded with the IMAP modified UTF-7 syntax.

   The server MUST send untagged response for any activity in any of the
   user's subscribed folders.  It MAY send untagged responses for
   activity in other folders, in which case the client MUST ignore
   messages it has no need for.  The server SHOULD notify the client
   about message modified in other namespaces, unless this is
   technically not possible.  In this case the server MUST notify the
   client of which namespaces cannot be monitored with the "EXCLUDES"
   tag in the continuation response.

   While the server has to provide past events to the client when
   entering IDLEPLUS, it MAY discard elements older than 30 minutes that
   were not transmitted to the client to avoid keeping too much data in
   memory.  Additionally the server SHOULD start keeping track of those
   events after the first call of IDLEPLUS to avoid unnecessary load.

   In each case it is up to the client to interrupt the IDLEPLUS call
   and fetch informations about the changes (enveloppe of the new
   message for EXISTS or flags of the message for STORED).

3.2.1.  EXISTS

   The EXISTS untagged response signals the arrival of a new message in
   the specified mailbox.

3.2.2.  EXPUNGE

   The EXPUNGE untagged response signals the deletion of a message in
   the specified mailbox.

3.2.3.  STORED

   The STORED untagged response signals a message has been changed.
   This usually means the flags of a given message were changed, for
   example if the message has been read or deleted (but not expunged
   yet).  Even use of the ".SILENT" store suffix will still cause this
   untagged response.

3.3.  Example


   C: A001 SELECT INBOX
   S: * FLAGS (Deleted Seen)
   S: * 3 EXISTS
   S: * 0 RECENT
   S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 1]
   S: A001 OK SELECT completed
   C: A002 IDLEPLUS
   S: + idling [EXCLUDES #news]
   ...time passes; new mail arrives...
   S: * 884 EXISTS "Some Folder"
   S: * 71 EXISTS INBOX
   C: DONE
   S: A002 OK IDLEPLUS terminated
   ...another client deletes mail 884 from Some Folder
   C: A003 UID FETCH 71 ALL
   S: * 4 FETCH (...)
   S: A003 OK UID FETCH completed
   C: A004 IDLE
   S: * 884 EXPUNGE "Some Folder"
   S: + idling [EXCLUDES #news]


4.  Acknowledgements

   The editor would like to thank anyone helping to make this document
   into a RFC as this is his first attempt.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The IDLEPLUS protocol keyworld needs to be registered in the imap4-
   capabilities registry via an IETF Review.


6.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this extension doesn't add any security

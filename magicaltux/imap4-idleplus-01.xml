    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a new extension for IMAP4 servers. This new extension aims to extend the functions provided by the existing IDLE extension (RFC 2177) to better fit needs of current IMAP4 clients by allowing monitoring of multiple folders.</t>
      <t>Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the author.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Most modern IMAP4rev1 <xref target="RFC3501">RFC&nbsp;3501</xref> clients support so-called push-imap way to receive emails in realtime in the form of IMAP IDLE <xref target="RFC2177">RFC&nbsp;2177</xref>. Those clients usually want to receive real time notification of new emails or deleted emails in more than one imap folder, which is not supported by IMAP IDLE. To workaround this limitation, those clients will open one connection per monitored folder and cause unneeded load on those servers.</t>
      <t>A typical user will have INBOX, Draft and Sent folders. This can increase dramatically if the user makes use of folders to filter mails, causing some users to have up to 30 folders (and idle IMAP connections via TCP).</t>
      <t>This draft proposes a new way for IMAP clients to receive change notifications on many folders without having to keep many open connections to the IMAP server.</t>
      <section title="Conventions">
        <t>In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively. If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol exchange.</t>
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
       document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <t>The IDLEPLUS extension is present in any IMAP server implementation that returns "IDLEPLUS" as one of the supported capabilities to the CAPABILITY command.</t>
      <t>The IDLEPLUS extension defines an additional command.</t>

                <t hangText="NO">failure: the server will not allow the IDLEPLUS command at this time</t>
                <t hangText="BAD">command unknown or arguments invalid</t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>The IDLEPLUS command may be used with any IMAP4 server implementation that returns "IDLEPLUS" as one of the supported capabilities to the CAPABILITY command. If the server does not advertise the IDLEPLUS capability, the client MUST NOT use the IDLEPLUS command and may either poll for mailbox updates or connect multiple times to the IMAP server and use IDLE command from <xref target="RFC2177">RFC 2177</xref>. In particular, the client MUST continue to be able to accept unsolicited untagged responses to ANY command, as specified in the base IMAP specification.</t>
        <t>The IDLEPLUS command is sent from the client to the server when the client is ready to accept unsolicited mailbox update messages. The server requests a response to the IDLE command using the continuation ("+") response. The IDLE command remains active until the client responds to the continuation, and as long as an IDLE command is active, the server is now free to send untagged EXISTS, EXPUNGE, and other messages at any time.</t>
        <t>Untagged responses by IDLEPLUS are slightly different from those expected by calls to IDLE. Those are detailed in <xref target="idleplus_responses">IDLEPLUS Responses</xref>.</t>
        <t>The IDLEPLUS command is terminated by the receipt of a "DONE" continuation from the client; such response satisfies the server's continuation request. At that point, the server MAY send any remaining queued untagged responses and then MUST immediately send the tagged response to the IDLEPLUS command and prepare to process other commands. As in the base specification, the processing of any new command may cause the sending of unsolicited untagged responses, subject to the ambiguity limitations. The client MUST NOT send a command while the server is waiting for the DONE, since the server will not be able to distinguish a command from a continuation.</t>
        <t>The server MAY consider a client inactive if it has an IDLEPLUS command running, and if such a server has an inactivity timeout it MAY log the client off implicitly at the end of its timeout period. Because of that, clients using IDLEPLUS are advised to terminate the IDLEPLUS and re-issue it at least every 29 minutes to avoid being logged off. This still allows a client to receive immediate mailbox updates even though it need only "poll" at half hour intervals.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="idleplus_responses" title="IDLEPLUS Responses">
        <t>When in IDLEPLUS mode the server will send different kinds of untagged responses to the client. Each untagged response is made of the message UID, the response type and the folder in which the message is stored. The mailbox name MUST NOT contain 8bit characters. Mailbox names containing non-ASCII characters should be encoded with the IMAP modified UTF-7 syntax.</t>
        <t>The server MUST send untagged response for any activity in any of the user's subscribed folders. It MAY send untagged responses for activity in other folders, in which case the client MUST ignore messages it has no need for. The server SHOULD notify the client about message modified in other namespaces, unless this is technically not possible. In this case the server MUST notify the client of which namespaces cannot be monitored with the "EXCLUDES" tag in the continuation response.</t>
        <t>While the server has to provide past events to the client when entering IDLEPLUS, it MAY discard elements older than 30 minutes that were not transmitted to the client to avoid keeping too much data in memory. Additionally the server SHOULD start keeping track of those events after the first call of IDLEPLUS to avoid unnecessary load.</t>
        <t>In each case it is up to the client to interrupt the IDLEPLUS call and fetch informations about the changes (enveloppe of the new message for EXISTS or flags of the message for STORED).</t>
        <section title="EXISTS">
          <t>The EXISTS untagged response signals the arrival of a new message in the specified mailbox.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="EXPUNGE">
          <t>The EXPUNGE untagged response signals the deletion of a message in the specified mailbox.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="STORED">
          <t>The STORED untagged response signals a message has been changed. This usually means the flags of a given message were changed, for example if the message has been read or deleted (but not expunged yet). Even use of the ".SILENT" store suffix will still cause this untagged response.</t>

Abstract

   Most of Peer-to-Peer survey papers are described about the P2P
   applications architecture. It is hard to compare PPSP with them with
   the high-level description. In this survey, we focus on the message
   design for the well-known P2P file downloading and streaming
   applications (Bittorrent and eMule) and study their base and
   enhancement approach in the peer and tracker protocol specifications.
   Through the survey, we summarize a common message design for the P2P
   streaming Protocol standardization.

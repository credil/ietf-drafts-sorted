Internet-Draft     RTCP XR Video Quality Report Blocks      October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Along with the wide deployment of broadband access and the
   development of new IPTV services (e.g., broadcast video, video on
   demand), there is increasing interest in monitoring and managing
   networks and applications that deliver real-time applications over
   IP, to ensure that all end users obtain acceptable video/audio
   quality.  The main drives come from operators, since offering
   performance monitoring capability can help diagnose network
   impairments, facilitate in root cause analysis and aid in verifying
   compliance with service level agreements (SLAs) between Internet
   Service Providers (ISPs) and content providers.

   The factors that affect real-time application quality can be split
   into two categories.  The first category consists of transport-
   dependent factors such as packet loss, delay and jitter (which also
   translates into losses in the playback buffer).  The factors in the
   second category are application-specific factors that affect video
   quality and are sensitivity to network errors.  These factors can be
   but not limited to video codec and loss recovery technique, coding
   bit rate, packetization scheme, and content characteristics.

   Compared with application-specific factors, the transport-dependent
   factors sometimes are not sufficient to measure video quality, since
   the ability to analyze the video in the application layer provides
   quantifiable measurements for subscriber Quality of Experience (QoE)
   that may not be captured in the transmission layers or from the RTP
   layer down.  In a typical scenario, monitoring of the transmission
   layers can produce statistics suggesting that quality is not an
   issue, such as the fact that network jitter is not excessive.
   However, problems may occur in the service layers leading to poor
   subscriber QoE.  Therefore monitoring using only network-level
   measurements may be insufficient when application layer video quality
   is required.

   In order to provide accurate measures of video quality for operators
   when transporting video across a network, the video quality Metrics
   is highly required which can be conveyed in the RTCP XR
   packets[RFC3611] and may have the following three benefits:

      *  Tuning the video encoder algorithm to satisfy video quality
         requirements
      *  Determining which system techniques to use in a given situation
         and when to switch from one technique to another as system
         parameters change
      *  Verifying the continued correct operation of an existing system

   RFC 3611 [RFC3611] defines seven report block formats for network

   management and quality monitoring.  However, there are no block types
   specifically designed for conveying video quality metrics.  This
   document focuses on specifying new report block types used to convey
   video-specific quality metrics.

   The report block types defined in this document fall into two
   categories.  The first category consists of general information
   regarding transmission quality, to be generated and processed by the
   RTP transport.  The report blocks in the second category convey
   metrics above transport that affect video quality and are sensitivity
   to network errors.

   Seven report block formats are defined by this document.  Of these,
   three are transport layer metrics:

      *  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block
      *  Audio-Video Playout Offset Report Block
      *  Layered Streams Statistics Metrics Block

   The other four are application layer metrics:

      *  Video Statistics Summary Report Block
      *  Video Stream Loss and Discard Metrics Block
      *  Video Stream Burst Metrics Block
      *  Synthetical Multimedia Quality Metrics Block


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Layered Component Packet

      a RTP packet using layered codecs containing the specified layered
      component, e.g., encoded stream at the base layer or at the
      enhancement layer.

   Picture Type

      Picture types used in the different video algorithms compose of
      the key-frame and the Derivation frame.  Key-frame is also called
      as reference frame and used as a reference for predicting other

      pictures.  It is coded without prediction from other pictures.
      The Derivation frame is derived from Key-frame using prediction
      from the reference frame.

      Transport Stream [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007]


3.  Applicability

   All the report blocks defined in this document could be used by
   dedicated network monitoring applications.  As specified in RFC 3611
   [RFC3611], for such an application it might be appropriate to allow
   more than 5% of RTP data bandwidth to be used for RTCP packets, thus
   allowing proportionately larger and more detailed report blocks.

   The Flows General Synchronization Offset Block Section 4.2 has been
   defined for various multimedia applications.  Such applications can
   use this report block to monitor offset between two RTP streams
   synchronization to ensure satisfactory QoE.  Tighter tolerances than
   typically used have been recommended for such applications.

   The Flows Synchronization Delay Report Block has been defined
   primarily for layered or multi-description video coding applications.
   When joining a layered video session in such an application, a
   receiver may not synchronize playout across the multimedia session
   until RTCP SR packets have been received on all of the component RTP
   sessions.  This report block can be used to ensure synchronization
   between different media layers for the same multimedia session.

   The Video Stream Loss and Discard Metrics Report Block, Video Stream
   Burst Metrics report Block, Video Statistics Summary Report Block and
   Layered Video Statistics Metrics Block can be applied to any real
   time video application, while Synthetical Multimedia Quality Metrics
   Report Block can be used in any real-time AV application .

4.1.  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block

   This block reports the initial synchronization delay between RTP
   sessions of the same media stream sent using Multi-Session
   Transmission [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-svc] or the initial synchronization
   delay betwen RTP session of the different media types
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-rtp-sync], which is beyond the information
   carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  Information is recorded
   about session bandwidth and synchronization delay.

   General synchronization offset: 32 bits
      This field indicates the synchronization offset time of one RTP
      stream in milliseconds relative to the reference RTP stream with
      the same CNAME and General Synchronisation Offset of zero
      [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-rtp-sync] This value is calculated based on
      the interarrival time between arbitray RTP packet and the
      reference RTP packet with the same CNAME , and timestamps of this
      arbitray RTP packet and the reference RTP packet with the same
      CNAME.

   This block reports layered streams statistics beyond the information
   carried in the Statistics Summary Report Block RTCP packet specified
   in the section 4.6 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].  Information is recorded
   about lost layered component packets, duplicated layered component
   packets.  Such information can be useful for network management and
   video quality monitoring.

   The report block contents are dependent upon a series of flag bits
   carried in the first part of the header.  Not all parameters need to
   be reported in each block.  Flags indicate which parameters are
   reported and which are not.  The fields corresponding to unreported
   parameters MUST be present, but are set to zero.  The receiver MUST
   ignore any Layered Streams Statistics Metrics Block with a non-zero
   value in any field flagged as unreported.

5.2.  Video Stream Loss and Discard Metrics Block

   This block reports Loss and Discard metrics statistics beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  The block
   reports separately on packets lost on the IP channel, and those that
   have been received but then discarded by the receiving jitter buffer.

   It is very useful to distinguish between packets lost by the network
   and those discarded due to jitter.  Both have equal effect on the
   quality of the video stream, however, having separate counts helps
   identify the source of quality degradation.  These fields MUST be

      specified frame (e.g., Key frame) (after the effects of applying
      any error protection such as FEC) by the total number of packets
      expected, multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting
      the maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the
      integer part.  The numbers of duplicated packets and discarded
      packets do not enter into this calculation.  Since receivers
      cannot be required to maintain unlimited buffers, a receiver MAY
      categorize late-arriving packets as lost.  The degree of lateness
      that triggers a loss SHOULD be significantly greater than that
      which triggers a discard.

   Discard rate: 8 bits
      The fraction of RTP data packets from the source that have been
      discarded since the beginning of reception, due to late or early
      arrival, under-run or overflow at the receiving jitter buffer.
      This value is expressed as a fixed point number with the binary
      point at the left edge of the field.  It is calculated by dividing
      the total number of discarded packets containing specified frame
      (e.g., Key Frame) (excluding duplicate packet discards) by the
      total number of packets expected, multiplying the result of the
      division by 256, limiting the maximum value to 255 (to avoid
      overflow), and taking the integer part.


5.3.  Video Stream Burst Metrics Block

   This block reports Burst metrics statistics beyond the information
   carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  It reports on the
   combined effect of losses and discards, as both have equal effect on
   video quality.

   In order to properly assess the quality of a video stream, it is
   desirable to consider the degree of burstiness of packet loss RFC
   3357 [RFC3357].  Following the one-way loss pattern sample metrics
   discussed in [RFC3357], a measure of the spacing between consecutive
   network packet loss or error events, is a "loss distance".  The loss
   distance metric captures the spacing between the loss periods.  The
   duration of a loss or error event (e.g. and how many packets are lost
   in that duration) is a "loss period", the loss period metric captures
   the frequency and length (burstiness) of loss once it starts.  Delay
   reports include the transit delay between RTP end points and the end
   system processing delays, both of which contribute to the user
   perceived delay.

   Implementations MUST provide values for all the fields defined here.
   For certain metrics, if the value is undefined or unknown, then the
   specified default or unknown field value MUST be provided.

   Loss Distance: 16 bits
      The mean duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the loss
      intervals that have occurred since the beginning of reception
      [DSLF].  The duration of each loss distance is calculated based
      upon the frames that mark the beginning and end of that period.
      It is equal to the timestamp of the end frame, plus the duration
      of the end frame, minus the timestamp of the beginning frame.  If
      the actual values are not available, estimated values MUST be
      used.  If there have been no burst periods, the burst duration
      value MUST be zero.

   Loss Period: 16 bits
      The mean duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the burst loss
      periods that have occurred since the beginning of reception
      [DSLF].  The duration of each period is calculated based upon the
      frame that marks the end of the prior burst loss and the frame

      that marks the beginning of the subsequent burst loss.  It is
      equal to the timestamp of the subsequent burst frame, minus the
      timestamp of the prior burst packet, plus the duration of the
      prior burst packet.  If the actual values are not available,
      estimated values MUST be used.  In the case of a gap that occurs
      at the beginning of reception, the sum of the timestamp of the
      prior burst packet and the duration of the prior burst packet are
      replaced by the reception start time.  In the case of a gap that
      occurs at the end of reception, the timestamp of the subsequent
      burst packet is replaced by the reception end time.  If there have
      been no gap periods, the gap duration value MUST be zero.

   Max Loss Duration of a single error: 16 bits
      The maximum loss duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the loss
      periods that have occurred since the beginning of reception.  The
      recommended max loss duration is specified as less than 16 ms in
      [DSLF], which provides a balance between interleaver depth
      protection from xDSL errors induced by impulse noise, delay added
      to other applications and video service QoE requirements to reduce
      visible impairments.

   MOS-V: 16 bits
      The estimated mean opinion score for video quality (MOS-V) is a
      video quality metric on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5 represents
      excellent and 1 represents unacceptable [G.1082][P.NAMS].  This
      metric is defined as not including the effects of audio
      impairments and can be compared to MOS scores obtained from video
      quality tests.  It is expressed as an integer in the range 10 to
      50, corresponding to MOS x 10.  For example, a value of 35 would
      correspond to an estimated MOS score of 3.5.

      A value of 127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable.

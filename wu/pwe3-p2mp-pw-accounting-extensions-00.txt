Internet-Draft        P2MP PW Accounting Extensions         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Draft draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw-00 [Root-Initiated P2MP PW]and
   Draft-jounay-niger-pwe3-source-initiated-p2mp-pw-01 [Source-Initiated
   P2MP PW] both propose to extend LDP protocol to support source
   initiated P2MP signaling.  The difference between these two drafts is
   the latter one needs root PE to get all leaf TAIIs, than send LDP FEC
   map message to build a P2MP tree, And the former one does not need
   TAII.

   Draft-jounay-niger-pwe3-source-initiated-p2mp-pw-01 is useful for
   accounting all egress PE attached CE information, but this makes the
   protocol more complex.  Draft draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw-00 is
   efficient in P2MP PW signaling, but using this mechanism requires NMS
   data to be correlated from multiple leaf PEs.

   This draft proposes a mechanism to convey P2MP PW accounting
   information.  This proposal allows a single router to be queried to
   obtain accounting information for a P2MP tree as a whole.

   This draft adds a new LDP Status TLV type to the LDP Notification
   message.

3.  P2MP PW accounting operation

3.1.   P2MP PW statistic TLV

   This draft specifies no new LDP message.

   This draft proposes a new statistic TLV to be used with LDP
   notification.

   An leaf PE Puts the statistic information in LDP notification message
   to allow the root PE maintain a particular P2MP PW accounting
   information, indicated by containing a statistic TLV.  The new
   statistic TLV format is as follows:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |Res|     PW statistic (TBD)    |            Length             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                         PW statistic                          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



                   Figure 1: PW Statistic Message Format

   The first 2 bits are reserved, and MUST be set to zero on transmit,
   and ignored on receive.

   PW statistic contains a particular P2MP PW statistic information
   within one leaf PE, information includes: AC numbers, the effective
   MTU, the minimum speed link and maximum speed link.

3.2.  How to use P2MP PW accounting

   In order to support the proposed mechanism, a node must be able of
   handling PW statistic advertisement.

   Once an egress PE successfully processes a Label Mapping Message for
   a P2MP PW, or it fails to accept the signaling for interface
   parameters not matching, it should send appropriate PW statistic
   information to notify the root PE of the PW ACs status.

   Once an new AC attached to an egress PE for a P2MP PW, or an existed
   AC detached, the egress PE should update the statistic and send
   updated statistic TLV along with notification message.

   When the root PE receives the leaf PE statistic reporting, it can
   store the values and combine the local information it has with
   received reporting information.

4.   IANA Considerations

   This document uses a new LDP TLV types; IANA already maintains a
   registry of name "TLV TYPE NAME SPACE" defined by RFC5036.  A value
   of 0x096D is suggested for assignment with this TLV.

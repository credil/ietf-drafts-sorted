1. Introduction 

   Multicasting is more efficient a method of supporting group 
   communication than unicasting.  With the wide deployment of 
   different wireless networks, multicast communication over wireless 
   network comes to attract more and more interests from content and 
   service providers, but still faces great challenges when considering 
   dynamic group membership and constant update of delivery path due to 
   node movement, which is highly required in the wireless or mobile 
   network.  On the other hand, unlike wired network, some of wireless 
   networks often offer limited reliability, consume more power and 
   cost more transmission overhead, thus in worse case are more prone 
   to loss and congestion.  

   Multicast network is generally constructed by IGMP/MLD group 
   management protocol to track valid receivers and by multicast 
   routing protocol to build multicast delivery paths.  This document 
   focuses only on IGMP/MLD protocols, which are used by a mobile user 
   to subscribe a multicast group and are most possibly to be exposed 
   to wireless link to support terminal mobility.  As IGMP and MLD are 
   designed for fixed users using wired link, they does not work 
   perfectly for wireless link types.  They should be enhanced or tuned 
   to adapt to wireless and mobile environment to meet the reliability 
   and efficiency requirements in the scenarios described in 
   [REQUIRE][RFC 5757]. 

   This memo proposes a variety of optimization approaches for tuning 
   IGMP/MLD protocols in wireless or mobile communication environment.  
   It aims to make the minimum tuning on the protocol behavior without 
   introducing interoperability issues, and to improve the performance 
   of wireless and mobile multicast networks.  These solutions can also 
   be used in wired network when efficiency and reliability are 
   required.  They are discussed in detail in Section 4. 

2. Impact of wireless and mobility on IGMP/MLD 

   This section analyzes the impact of wireless or mobility on IGMP/MLD 
   by comparing wireless multicast with wired multicast and comparing 
   different wireless link models. It then gives the requirements of

   wireless and mobile multicast on IGMP/MLD protocols according to the 
   analysis. 

2.1. Comparison analysis between wired and wireless multicast 

   Existing multicast support for fixed user can be extended to mobile 
   users in wireless environments. However applying such support to 
   wireless multicast is difficult for the following five reasons.   

   O Limited Bandwidth: In contrast with wired link, wireless link 
      usually has limited bandwidth.  This situation will be made even 
      worse if wireless link has to carry high volume video multicast 
      data.  Also the bandwidth available in upstream direction and 
      downstream direction may not be equal. 

   O Large packets Loss: In contrast with wired multicast, wireless 
      multicast has packet loss that range between 1% and 30%, based on 
      the links types and conditions.  And when packets have to travel 
      between home and access networks e.g. through tunnel, the packets 
      are prone to be lost if the distance between the two networks is 
      long. 

   O Frequent Membership change: In fixed multicast, membership change 
      only happens when a user leave or joins a group while in the 
      mobile multicast, membership changes may also occur when a user 
      changes its location. 

   O Prone to performance degradation: Due to possible unwanted 
      interaction of protocols across layers and user movement, the 
      wireless network may be overwhelmed with more excessive traffic 
      than wired network. In worse case, this may lead to network 
      performance degrading and network connection complete loss.  

   O Increased Leave Latency: Unlike fixed multicast, the leave latency 
      in the mobile multicast will be increased due to user movement. 
      And if the traffic has to be transmitted between access network 
      and the home network, or if the handshake is required between 
      these two networks, the Leave Latency will be increased further 
      more. 

   Figure 1 shows the details for the difference between wired/fixed 
   multicast and wireless/mobile multicast.

2.2. Link models analysis for wireless multicast 

   There are various types of wireless links, each with different 
   feature and performance. In this document, we according to the 
   transmission mode categorize the wireless link type into three 
   typical link models:  

    O Point To Point (PTP) link model 
    O Point To Multipoint (PTMP) link model 
    O Broadcast link model 
    

   PTP link model is the model with one dedicated link that connects 
   exactly two communication facilities. For multicast transmission, 
   each PTP link has only one receiver and the bandwidth is dedicated

   for each receiver. Also one unique prefix or set of unique prefixes 
   will be assigned to each receiver. Such link model can be 
   accomplished by running PPP on the link or having separate VLAN for 
   each receiver. 

   PTMP link model is the model with multipoint link which consists of 
   a series of receivers and one centralized transmitter. Unlike P2P 
   link model, PTMP provide downlink common channels and dedicated 
   uplink channel for each user.  Bandwidth and prefix in this model 
   are shared by all the receivers on the same link. Therefore 
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) should be performed to check 
   whether the assigned address is used by other receivers. 

   Broadcast link model is the model with the link connecting two or 
   more nodes and supporting broadcast transmission. Such link model is 
   quite similar to fixed Ethernet link model and its link resource is 
   shared in both uplink and downlink directions.  The bandwidth and 
   prefix are shared by all the receivers and DAD is required to avoid 
   address collision. 

   Figure 2 shows the details for the difference between different 
   wireless link models.

2.3. Requirements of wireless and mobile multicast on IGMP/MLD 

   Due to the characteristics of wireless and mobile multicast 
   described in the section 2.1 and 2.2, it is desirable for IGMP and 
   MLD to have the following characteristics when used in wireless and 
   mobile networks [REQUIRE]: 

   o Adaptive to different link characteristics:  IGMP and MLD are 
   originally designed for wired multicast and some of their processing 
   is not applicable to wireless multicast for its asymmetrical link, 
   limited bandwidth, larger packet loss rate, increased leave latency, 
   and etc.  Also Wireless network has various link types, each of them 
   has different bandwidth and performance. These require IGMP/MLD 
   protocol behavior should be tuned to adapt to different link model 
   and link conditions. 

   o Minimal Join and Leave Latency:  Fast join and leave of a 
   subscriber helps to improve the user's experience during channel 
   join and channel zapping.  Fast leave also facilitates releasing of 
   unused network resources quickly.  Besides, mobility and handover 
   may cause a user to join and leave a multicast group frequently, 
   which also require fast join and leave to accelerate service 
   activation and to optimize resource usages. 

   o Robustness to packet loss:  Wireless link has the characteristic 
   that packet transmission is unreliable due to instable link 
   conditions and limited bandwidth.  For mobile IP network, packets 
   sometimes have to travel between home network and foreign network 
   and have the possibility of being lost due to long distance 
   transmission.  These network scenarios have more strict robustness 
   requirement on delivery of IGMP and MLD protocol messages. 

   o Minimum packet transmission:  Wireless link resources are usually 
   more precious and limited compared to their wired counterpart, and 
   are prone to be congested when carrying high volume multicast stream.  
   Minimizing packet exchange without degrading general protocol 
   performance should also be emphasized to improve efficiency and make 
   good use of network capacity and processing capability.  

   o Avoiding packet burst:  Large number of packets generated within a 
   short time interval may have the tendency to deteriorate wireless 
   network conditions.  IGMP and MLD when using in wireless and mobile 
   networks should be optimized if their protocol message generation 
   has the potential of introducing packet burst.

Internet-Draft  Tuning IGMPv3/MLDv2 Protocol Behavior      October 2010 
    

   According to these requirements, in the following parts of the 
   document, current versions of IGMP/MLD protocols are evaluated 
   whether their various protocol aspects are applicable to wireless 
   and mobile multicast communications.  They will be optimized to meet 
   these requirements without new features introduced on the wire or 
   link, without new message type defined, and without interoperability 
   issues introduced, which is referred to as "tuning" of IGMP/MLD 
   protocols. 

3. Evaluation of IGMP/MLD on wireless and mobile multicast 

   This section analyzes the applicability of IGMP and MLD to wireless 
   communication in the following aspects: 

   O General evaluation of different versions: IGMPv2 [RFC2236] and 
      MLDv1 [RFC2710] only support ASM communication mode. They do not 
      support SSM subscription and explicit tracking. IGMPv3 [RFC3376] 
      and MLDv2 [RFC3810] and their lightweight version LW-IGMPv3/LW-
      MLDv2 [RFC5760] support all the features of ASM/SSM communication 
      modes and explicit tracking. Because SSM is more efficient and 
      secure than ASM for IPTV application, and explicit tracking 
      enables faster channel zapping and better manageability capability, 
      IGMPv3/MLDv2 and LW-IGMPv3/MLDv2 are more promising to be deployed 
      widely than IGMPv2 and MLDv1. 

   O Robustness: IGMP/MLD actively sends unsolicited Report or Leave 
      message to join or leave a group, and solicited Report to respond 
      to Queries.  Unsolicited Report and Leave messages are more 
      important for ensuring satisfactory user experience and should be 
      guaranteed to improve service performance. Current IGMP and MLD 
      provide the reliability for these messages by non responsive 
      retransmission, which is not adequate from both the robustness and 
      efficiency aspects when they are used on unreliable wireless link 
      or have to be exchanged over the tunnel between home network and 
      access network separated by long distance [ROBUST][ACK]. For 
      IGMPv3/MLDv2, because unsolicited report and leave messages will 
      not be suppressed by report from other host, it is possible to 
      adopt acknowledgement-retransmission to improve reliability and 
      reduce superfluous packet transmission [IGMP-ACK]. 

      Besides, for IGMPv3/MLDv2, because the router could by explicit 
      tracking establishes membership database recording each valid 
      receiver, it is possible to deduce the possible loss of some 
      protocol messages according to the feedback after their 
      transmission, and to take some remedies (e.g. by retransmission)

      to enable more reliable transmission of these messages in bad 
      conditions. 

   O Efficiency: IGMPv2 and MLDv1 use host suppression to suppress 
      duplicated membership reports on the link. In IGMPv3 and MLDv2, 
      because host suppression is not adopted, the report count will be 
      numerous if the number of valid receivers on the network is large.  
      IGMPv3 and MLDv2 should be optimized to try to minimize 
      unnecessary packet transmission to compensate this drawback. As an 
      example, because an IGMPv3/MLDv2 router has record of each user in 
      its state database by explicit tracking, it is possible to 
      eliminate the need for query timeouts when receiving leave 
      messages and to improve the efficiency by reducing both the 
      unnecessary Queries and reports generated on a network.  

   And as described in [REQUIRE] and [RFC5757], the default timer 
   values and counter values specified in IGMP and MLD were not 
   designed for the mobility context. This may result in a slow 
   reaction following a client join or leave, in possible packet loss 
   under worse conditions, or in overburdening the wireless link by 
   excessive packets exchange than necessary. These issues can be 
   addressed by tuning these parameters for the expected packet loss on 
   a link to optimize service performance and resource usage.  

   The comparison between IGMPv2/MLDv1 and IGMPv3/MLDv2 is illustrated 
   in figure 3.  In summary, it is desirable to choose IGMPv3/MLDv2 or 
   LW-IGMPv3/MLDv2 as the group management protocol for wireless or 
   mobile multicast. They should be optimized to adapt to wireless and 
   mobile networks to meet the efficiency and reliability requirement 
   for these networks. These optimizations range from the tuning of the 
   parameters (e.g. the Query Interval and other variables), to the 
   tuning of protocol behavior without introducing interoperability 
   issues. Considering an enhancement in one direction might introduce 
   side effects in another one, balances should be taken carefully to 
   avoid defects and improve protocol performance as a whole.

4. IGMP/MLD tuning optimization for Wireless or Mobile Network 

   As mentioned in section 2, IGMPv3/MLDv2 or LW-IGMPv3/MLDv2 is 
   recommended to be used as the basis for optimization of IGMP/MLD to 
   adapt to wireless and mobile networks.  In this section, taking 
   these characteristics requirement into account, we will discuss 
   several optimization approaches for tuning of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 in 
   wireless environment.  The optimizations try to minimize the packet 
   transmission for both the Reports and Queries, and at the meanwhile 
   take the factor of improving reliability into account, with minimum 
   cost.  Different link types are also considered for the tuning 
   behavior. 

4.1. Explicit Tracking and Query Suppression  

   In IGMPv2/MLDv1, the member reports are suppressed if the same 
   report has already been sent by another host in the network which is 
   also referred to as host suppression. As described in the A.2 of 
   [RFC3810], the suppression of multicast listener reports has been 
   removed in MLDv2 due to the following reasons: 


 
 
Wu,et al               Expires April 25, 2011                [Page 11] 

Internet-Draft  Tuning IGMPv3/MLDv2 Protocol Behavior      October 2010 
    

   O Routers may want to track per-host multicast listener status on an 
      interface. This enables the router to track each individual host 
      that is joined to a particular group or channel and allow minimal 
      leave latencies when a host leaves a multicast group or channel.  

   o Multicast Listener Report suppression does not work well on 
      bridged LANs.  Many bridges and Layer2/Layer3 switches that 
      implement MLD snooping do not forward MLD messages across LAN 
      segments in order to prevent multicast listener report suppression. 

   o By eliminating multicast listener report suppression, hosts have 
      fewer messages to process; this leads to a simpler state machine 
      implementation. 

   o In MLDv2, a single multicast listener report now bundles multiple 
      multicast address records to decrease the number of packets sent. 
      In comparison, the previous version of MLD required that each 
      multicast address be reported in a separate message. 

   Without host suppression, it is possible to enable explicit tracking 
   on a router by which the local replication can be used by the router 
   to inspect incoming join and leave requests, record or refresh the 
   membership state for each host on the interface, and take 
   appropriate action to each received report. In the meanwhile, the 
   router builds a table to track which channel being forwarded to each 
   port. If the channel being requested to view is already being 
   received at the router, it can replicate the stream and forward to 
   this new requester which ensure good response time. 

   By using the tracking table mentioned above, the router has the 
   capability to learn if a particular multicast address has any 
   members on an attached link or if any of the sources from the 
   specified list for the particular multicast address has any members 
   on an attached link or not. Such capability makes Group specific 
   Query or Source-and-Group Specific Queries, which are sent to query 
   other members when a member leaves, unnecessary to be used because 
   the router has already known who are active on the interface using 
   explicit tracking. Therefore it is desirable that these two Queries 
   are eliminated when explicit tracking is used. But General 
   periodical Query by a router to solicit current state reports to 
   refresh existing membership state database should still be used to 
   prevent incorrectness of the database due to the possible loss of 
   explicit join and leave message in some cases. 

   The main benefits of using explicit tracking without Group specific 
   Query or Source-and-Group Specific Queries are that it provides:

Internet-Draft  Tuning IGMPv3/MLDv2 Protocol Behavior      October 2010 
    

   O minimizing packet number and packet burst: Elimination of Group and 
     Source-Group specific Queries when a member leaves a group will 
     reduce the number of transmitted Group Specific Queries. And 
     finally the total number of Reports in response to Group Specific 
     Queries can be drastically reduced. 

   O Minimal leave latencies: an IGMPv3/MLDv2 router configured with 
     explicit tracking can immediately stop forwarding traffic if the 
     last host to request to receive traffic from the router indicates 
     its leave from the group. 

   O Faster channel changing: The channel change time of the receiver 
     application depends on the leave latency, that is to say, single 
     host can not receive the new multicast stream before forwarding of 
     the old stream has stopped. 

   O Reducing Power consumption: Due to elimination of the suppression 
     of membership reports, the host does not need to spend processing 
     power to hear and determine if the same report has already been 
     sent by another host in the network, which is beneficial to mobile 
     hosts that do not have enough battery power. 

4.2. Report Suppression for the hosts  

   The large number of Reports and bad link condition may result in 
   packets burst. This packet burst can be mitigated by having the 
   router aggregate the responses (membership reports) from multiple 
   clients. The router can intercept IGMP/MLD reports coming from hosts, 
   and forwards a summarized version to the upstream router only when 
   necessary. Typically this means that the router will forward IGMP/MLD 
   membership reports as follows: 

   - Unsolicited membership reports (channel change requests) are 
   forwarded only when the first subscriber joins a multicast group, or 
   the last subscriber leaves a multicast group. This tells the upstream 
   router to begin or stop sending this channel to this router. 

   - Solicited membership reports (sent in response to a query) are 
   forwarded once per multicast group. The router may also aggregate 
   multiple responses together into a single membership report. 

4.3. Query Suppression for the routers  

   The large number of Queries and bad link condition may result in 
   packets burst. This packet burst can be mitigated by having the 
   downstream router stop forwarding IGMP/MLD Queries packets sent to 

 
 
Wu,et al               Expires April 25, 2011                [Page 13] 

Internet-Draft  Tuning IGMPv3/MLDv2 Protocol Behavior      October 2010 
    

   the hosts and respond with report as proxy to the upstream router. 
   Typically this means that the router will: 

   - Never send a specific query to any client, and 

   - Send general queries only to those clients receiving at least one 
   multicast group 

4.4. Minimizing Query Frequency by increasing interval each time  

   In IGMPv3/MLDv2, Group Specific Queries and Source and Group 
   specific Queries are sent for [Last Member Query Count] times with 
   short fixed [Last Member Query Interval], to learn whether there are 
   valid members from an attached link.  If the network is undergoing 
   congestion, the multiple transmissions of the queries may further 
   deteriorate the bad conditions.  To eliminate the bad effects for 
   this, these Queries can be slowed down when a router can not collect 
   successfully expected members' report responses in the mean while it 
   detects the network congestion is going to happen.  The slowing down 
   process of the Queries could be arranged in a prolonged time 
   interval as described in [ADAPTIVE].  

   The slow down behavior is: a router after sending a Query, if 
   acquires the expected responses from the receivers, refreshes its 
   state database and stop the querying retransmission process, or if 
   after a time interval fails to get the expected report responses, 
   resends a Query with an increased (e.g. double) interval.  This 
   process can be repeated, for each time the retransmission is 
   arranged in a prolonged time interval, till the router receives the 
   expected responses, or determines the receiver is unreachable and 
   then stops the sending of the Query ultimately.  The router can make 
   judgment on not getting expected response from the Queries in the 
   following cases: 

   O When Group Specific Query and Source and Group Specific Queries 
      are used to track other numbers, the router can not collect any 
      response from the link.  

   O When all group members leave the group or move out of scope, the 
      General Query sent by the router can not solicit any responses 
      from the link, as mentioned in section 4.9. 

   O When General Query is retransmitted due to possible loss deducing 
      from no responses from valid members in the database.  



 
 
Wu,et al               Expires April 25, 2011                [Page 14] 

Internet-Draft  Tuning IGMPv3/MLDv2 Protocol Behavior      October 2010 
    

   O When General Query is retransmitted by a router on startup 
     [RFC3376][RFC3810], it gets no membership response from the 
     interface. 

   O When unicast Query is sent to solicit a particular receiver, if 
      the router can not get responses from the receiver, as described 
      in section 4.5 and 4.6. 

   In the above cases, if the router fails to get expected response 
   from the network, and if the link condition is bad or in congestion, 
   the router could retransmit the Queries in increased interval.  This 
   query retransmission with incremental interval enables the router to 
   reduce the total packet retransmission times in the same time period 
   comparing with retransmission for multiple times with fixed interval, 
   and at the mean time gain some degree of reliability.  The variable 
   time interval and the termination condition should be configurable 
   and could be set according to actual network condition, which is out 
   the scope of this document. 

4.5. Switching Between Unicast Query and Multicast Query 

    IGMP/MLD protocols define the use of multicast Queries whose 
    destination addresses are multicast addresses and also allow use of 
    unicast Queries with unicast destination.  The unicast Query is sent 
    only for one destination and has the advantages of not affecting 
    other host on the same link.  This is especially desirable for 
    wireless communication because the mobile terminal often has limited 
    battery power. But if the number of valid receivers is large, using 
    unicast Query instead of multicast Query will introduce large number 
    of Queries because each Query will be generated for each member, 
    which will not be an efficient use of link resources.  In this case 
    the normal multicast Query will be a good choice because only one 
    Query needs to be sent. On the other hand of the number of receivers 
    to be queried is small, the unicast Query is advantageous over 
    multicast one. 

    The router can choose to switch between unicast and multicast Query 
    according to the practical network conditions.  For example, if the 
    receiver number is small, the router could send unicast Queries 
    respectively to each receiver to solicit their membership states, 
    without arousing other host which is in the dormant state. When the 
    receiver number reaches a predefined level, the router could change 
    to use multicast Queries.  The router could make the switching 
    flexibly according to practical conditions to improve the efficiency.

4.6. Using General Query with Unicast Query 

   Unicast Query also can be used in addition to General Query to 
   improve the robustness of solicited reports when General Query fails 
   to collect its valid members. It requires the explicit tracking to 
   be enabled on the router. Its basic behavior is: a router after 
   sending a periodical Query collects successfully all the members' 
   report responses except for one or two which are currently still 
   valid in its database.  This may be because the non-respondent ones 
   silently leave the network without any notification, or because 
   their reports are lost due to some unknown reason.  The router in 
   this case could choose to unicast a Query respectively to each non-
   respondent receiver to check whether they are still alive for the 
   multicast reception, without affecting the majority of receivers 
   that have already responded.  Unicast Queries under this condition 
   could be sent for [Last Member Query Count] times, following the 
   same rule of [3376] or [3810], or  could be resent in incremental 
   interval, as described in section 4.4. 

4.7. Retransmission of General Queries 

   In IGMPv3 and MLDv2, apart from the continuously periodical 
   transmission, General Query is also transmitted during a router's 
   startup. It will be transmitted for [Startup Query Count] times with 
   [Startup Query Interval], to improve reliability of General Query 
   during startup.  There are some other cases where retransmission of 
   General Query is beneficial which are not covered by current 
   IGMPv3/MLDv2 protocols as shown in the following.  
    
   For example, a router which keeps track of all its active receivers, 
   if after sending a General Query, may fail to get any response from 
   the receivers which are still valid in its membership database. This 
   may be because all the valid receivers leaves the groups or moves out 
   of the range of the link at the moment, or because all the responses 
   of the receivers are lost, or because the sent Query does not arrive 
   at the other side of the link.  If current database indicates the 
   number of the valid receiver is not small, the router could choose to 
   compensate this situation by retransmitting the General Query to 
   solicit its active members. 
    
   This compensating General Query could be sent several times, if the 
   router can not get any feedback from the receivers which are previous 
   in the database.  The repetition of the transmission could in fixed

   interval such as [Last Member Query Interval], or could in prolonged 
   interval if the link condition is not good. 
    
4.8. General Query Suppression with no receiver 

   In IGMPv3 and MLDv2, General Query is multicast sent periodically 
   and continuously without any limitations.  It helps solicit the 
   state of current valid member but has influence on all terminals, 
   whether they are valid multicast receivers or not.  When there is no 
   receiver on the link, the transmission of the General Query is a 
   waste of resources for both terminals and the router.   

   The IGMPv3/MLDv2 router could suppress its transmission of General 
   Query if there is no valid multicast receiver on the link, e.g. in 
   the following cases: 

   O If the last member reports its leave for a group. This could be 
   judged by an explicit tracking router checking its membership 
   database, or by a non explicit tracking router sending Group and 
   Source Group Specific Queries; 

   O If the only member on a PTP link reports its leaving; 

   O If the router after retransmission of General Queries on startup 
      fails to get any response from any member; 

   O If the router previously has valid members but fails to get any 
      response from any member after several rounds of General Queries 
      or Unicast Queries; 

   In these cases the router could make a decision that no member is on 
   this link and totally stop its transmission of periodical General 
   Queries. If afterwards there is valid multicast receiver joins a 
   group, the router could resume the original cycle of transmission of 
   General Queries. Because General Query has influences on all the 
   terminals on the link, suppressing it when it is not needed is 
   beneficial for both the link efficiency and terminal power saving. 

4.9. Tuning Response Delay according to link type and status 

   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 use delayed response mechanism to spread Report 
   messages from different hosts over a longer interval which can 
   greatly reduce possibility of packet burstiness. This is implemented 
   by the host responding to a Query in a specific time randomly chosen 
   between 0 and [Maximum Response Delay]. The value of [Maximum 
   Response Delay] parameter is determined by the router and is carried 
 
 
Wu,et al               Expires April 25, 2011                [Page 17] 

Internet-Draft  Tuning IGMPv3/MLDv2 Protocol Behavior      October 2010 
    

   in Query messages to inform the valid hosts to make the selection.  
   A long delay will lessen the burstiness but will increase leave 
   latency (the time between when the last listener stops listening to 
   a source or multicast address and when the traffic stops flowing).  

   In order to avoid burstiness of MLD messages and reduce leave 
   latency, explicit tracking with Group Specific Query eliminated is 
   recommended to be used first to reduce leave latency. Then the 
   Response Delay may be dynamically calculated based on the expected 
   number of Reporters for each Query and link type and link status.  

    O If the expected number of Reporters is large and link condition is 
      bad, the system administrator MUST choose the longer Maximum 
      Response Delay; if the expected number of Reporters is small and 
      the link condition is good, the administrator may choose the 
      smaller Maximum response Delay. In this case, the IGMP/MLD packet 
      burstiness can be reduced.  

    o Another case is if the link type is PTP which means the resource 
      is dedicated for one receiver on each link, then the Maximum 
      Response Delay can be chosen smaller, if the link type is shared 
      medium link or P2MP, then the Maximum Response Delay can be 
      configured larger. 

    The Maximum Response Delay can be configured by the administrator as 
    mentioned above, or be calculated automatically by software tool 
    implemented according to experiential model on different link modes.  
    As the router arrives at a value appropriate for current link type 
    and conditions, it will encode the value in Query messages to inform 
    the host to make the response.  The determination of the instant 
    Maximum Response Delay value is out of this document's scope. 

4.10. Triggering reports and queries quickly during handover 

    As a mobile terminal is moving from one network to another, if it is 
    a multicast receiver from a group, its new access network should try 
    to deliver the content to the receiver without disruption or 
    performance deterioration.  For the smooth switching between 
    networks, the terminal's membership should be acquired as quickly as 
    possible by the new access network.  

   For the access router, it could trigger a Query to the terminal as 
   soon as it detects a new terminal on its link.  This could be a 
   General Query if the router does not know whether or not the 
   terminal is a valid receiver or if the number of the entering 
   terminals is not small. Or this Query could also be a unicast Query

Internet-Draft  Tuning IGMPv3/MLDv2 Protocol Behavior      October 2010 
    

   for only a small quantity of terminals to prevent unnecessary action 
   of other terminals in the switching area. 

   For the terminal, it could trigger a report if it is currently in 
   the multicast reception state.  This helps establish more quickly 
   the membership states and enable faster multicast stream injection 
   because active report from the host does not requires the router to 
   wait for the query-response round in the passive reporting cases.

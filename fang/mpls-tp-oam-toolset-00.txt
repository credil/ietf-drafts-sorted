1. Introduction 
 
    
   The Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Requirements 
   for Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP)  
   networks are defined in RFC 5860 [RFC 5860]. MPLS-TP OAM mechanisms 
   and multiple OAM tools have been developed based on MPLS-TP OAM 
   requirements. 
    
   This document provides an overview of MPLS-TP OAM tools, including

   OAM; MPLS-TP Fault management tools; and Performance Management 
   tools, OAM toolset utilization, and IANA assigned code point under 
   G-Ach consideration.  
    
   The protocol definitions for each individual MPLS-TP OAM tool are 
   defined in separate RFCs (or Working Group documents while this 
   document is work in progress) this document references.

3. Brief Overview of MPLS-TP OAM Requirements 
 
   This following Architectural and Functional Requirements are 
   defined by RFC 5860. They are captured here for easy reading before 
   discussing the toolset. 
    
   3.1.  Architectural Requirements  

    
   The MPLS OAM Supports point-to-point bidirectional PWs, point-to-
   point co-routed bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point bidirectional 
   Sections, point-to-point associated bidirectional LSPs, point-to-
   point unidirectional LSPs, and point-to-multipoint LSPs, support 
   LSPs and PWs in single domain and across domains. 
    
   The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the underlying 
   tunneling or point-to-point technology or transmission media. The 
   protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the service a PW may 
   emulate. 
    
   The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the underlying 
   tunneling or point-to-point technology or transmission media. The 
   protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the service a PW may 
   emulate. 
    
   In-band OAM MUST be implemented. OAM packets for a specific PW, 
   LSP, or Section MUST follow the exact same data path as user 
   traffic of the same.   
    
   The solutions MUST operate OAM functions with or without relying on 
   IP capabilities.  
    
   It is REQUIRED that OAM interoperability is achieved between 
   distinct domains with different operational models, e.g. with IP or 
   without IP support in the data plane.  
    
   And OAM functions MUST be configurable even in the absence of a 
   control plane. 
       
   3.2. Functional Requirements  
    
   In general, MPLS-TP OAM tools MUST provide functions to detect, 
   diagnose, localize, and notify the faults when occur. The mechanism 

     
                                                              [Page 6] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP OAM-Toolset                                    March 2011 
    
   for correction actions trigged by fault detection SHOULD be 
   provided. 
    
   The following are the fault detection functional requirements 
    
   - Continuity Checks: a function to enable an End Point to monitor 
   the liveness of a PW, LSP, or Section. 
    
   - Connectivity Verifications: a function to enable an End Point to 
   determine whether or not it is connected to specific End Point(s) 
   by means of the expected PW, LSP, or Section.  
    
   - Route Tracing: the functionality to enable an End Point to 
   discover the Intermediate (if any) and End Point(s) along a PW, 
   LSP, or Section. 
 
   - Diagnostic Tests: a function to enable conducting diagnostic 
   tests on a PW, LSP, or Section.  For example, a loop-back function. 
    
   - Lock Instruct: the functionality to enable an End Point of a PW, 
   LSP, or Section to instruct its associated End Point(s) to lock the 
   PW, LSP, or Section. 
    
   - Lock Reporting: a function to enable an Intermediate Point of a 
   PW or LSP to report, to an End Point of that same PW or LSP, a lock 
   condition indirectly affecting that PW or LSP. 
    
   - Alarm Reporting: the functionality to enable an Intermediate 
   Point of a PW or LSP to report, to an End Point of that same PW or 
   LSP, a fault or defect condition indirectly affecting that PW or 
   LSP. 
    
   - Remote Defect Indication: a function to enable an End Point to 
   report, to its associated End Point, a fault or defect condition 
   that it detects on a PW, LSP, or Section for which they are the End 
   Points. 
    
   - Client Failure Indication: a function to enable the propagation, 
   from edge to edge of an MPLS-TP network, of information pertaining 
   to a client fault condition detected at an End Point of a PW or 
   LSP, if the client layer OAM does not provide alarm notification. 
    
   - Packet Loss Measurement: a function to enable the quantification 
   of packet loss ratio over a PW, LSP, or Section. 
    
   - Packet Loss Measurement: a function to enable the quantification 
   of the one-way, and the two-way, delay ratio over a PW, LSP, or

4. MPLS-TP OAM Mechanisms and Toolset Summary 
    
   The following subsections provide the summary of MPLS-TP OAM Fault 
   Management and Performance Management toolset, with indication of 
   the corresponding IETF RFCs (or Internet drafts while this document 
   is work in progress) to support the MPLS OAM functionalities 
   defined in RFC 5860. 
    
    
   4.1. In-band OAM Mechanisms 
 
   To meet the In-band OAM requirements for MPLS-TP, Generic 
   Associated Channel is created [RFC 5586]. It generalizes the 
   applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header 
   (ACH) to enable a control chancel associated to MPLS Label 
   Switching Paths in addition to PW. 
    
   The Generic Associated Label (GAL) is defined by assigning one of 
   the reserved MPLS label values to the G-Ach, to allow the 
   identification of the Associated Channel Header in the label stack. 
    
   The creation of G-Ach and GAL provided the necessary mechanisms for 
   building in-band OAM MPLS-TP toolset. 
    
   RFC 5586 [RFC 5586] An-In-Band Data Communication Network for the 
   MPLS Transport Profile describes how the G-Ach may be used to for 
   Management Communication and Signaling Communication. 
 
    
   4.2. Fault Management Toolset  
    
   The following tables provide the summary of MPLS-TP OAM Fault 
   Management toolset functions, protocol definitions, and the IETF 
   RFCs or Internet drafts. 
    
   The following table provide the Performance Monitoring Functions, 
   protocol definitions, and corresponding RFCs or Internet Drafts. 
 
   (Editor's note: only RFCs are referenced in the final version of

6. IANA assigned code points under G-Ach 
    
   OAM toolset/functions defined under G-Ach MUST use IANA assigned 
   code points, using Experimental Code Point under G-Ach is 
   inappropriate and it can lead to interoperability problems and 
   potential Code Point collision in production network. 
    
   RFC 5586 "MPLS Generic Associated Channel" stated the following in 
   IANA consideration section: A requirement has emerged (see [RFC 
   5860]) to allow for optimizations or extensions to OAM and other 
   control protocols running in an associated channel to be 
   experimented without resorting to the IETF standards process, by 
   supporting experimental code points. This would prevent code points 
   used for such functions from being used from the range allocated 
   through the IETF standards and thus protects an installed base of 
   equipment from potential inadvertent overloading of code points.  
   In order to support this requirement, IANA has changed the code 
   point allocation scheme for the PW Associated Channel Type be 
   changed as follows: 
    
        0 - 32751: IETF Review 
        32760 - 32767: Experimental 
    
   Code points in the experimental range MUST be used according to the 
   guidelines of RFC 3692 [RFC 3692].  Functions using experimental G-
   Ach code points MUST be disabled by default. 
    
   The guidelines on the usage of experimental numbers are defined in 
   IETF RFC 3692. As indicated by RFC 3692: The experimental numbers 
   are useful when experimenting new protocols or extending existing 
     
                                                             [Page 11] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP OAM-Toolset                                    March 2011 
    
   protocols in order to test and experiment the new functions, as part 
   of implementation.  RFC 3692 reserves a range of numbers for 
   experimentation when the need of such experimentation has been 
   identified.  
    
   However, the experimental numbers "are reserved for generic testing 
   purposes, and other implementations may use the same numbers for 
   different experimental uses." "Experimental numbers are intended for 
   experimentation and testing and are not intended for wide or general 
   deployments." "Shipping a product with a specific value pre-enabled 
   would be inappropriate and can lead to interoperability problems 
   when the chosen value collides with a different usage, as it someday 
   surely will."  
    
   Further more, "it would be inappropriate for a group of vendors, a 
   consortia, or another Standards Development Organization to agree 
   among themselves to use a particular value for a specific purpose 
   and then agree to deploy devices using those values."  Experimental 
   numbers are not guaranteed to be unique by definition. There is the 
   risk of code point collision when using Experimental Code Point in 
   production networks.  
    
   Similar statements can also be found in RFC4929 "Change Process for 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
   Protocols and Procedures". As described in [RFC 4775], "non-
   standard extensions, including experimental values, are not to be 
   portrayed as industrial standards whether by an individual vendor, 
   an industry forum, or a standards body."

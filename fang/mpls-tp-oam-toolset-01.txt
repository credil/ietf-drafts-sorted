1. Introduction 
 
   The Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Requirements 
   for Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) 
   networks are defined in RFC 5860 [RFC 5860]. MPLS-TP OAM mechanisms 
   and multiple OAM tools have been developed based on MPLS-TP OAM 
   requirements. 
    
   This document provides an overview of the MPLS-TP OAM toolset, 
   which consists of MPLS-TP fault management and performance 
   monitoring. This overview includes a brief recap of MPLS-TP OAM 
   requirements and functions, and of the generic mechanisms created 
   in the MPLS data plane to support in-band OAM. The importance of 
   using IANA assigned code point under G-Ach when supporting MPLS-TP 
   OAM is also discussed.  
    
   The protocol definitions for each individual MPLS-TP OAM tool are 
   specified in separate RFCs or Working Group documents while this 
   document is work in progress, which are referenced by this 
   document.

3. Brief Overview of MPLS-TP OAM Requirements 
 
   This following Architectural and Functional Requirements are 
   defined by RFC 5860. They are captured here for easy reading before 
   discussing the toolset. 
    
   3.1.  Architectural Requirements  
 
   The MPLS-TP OAM Supports point-to-point bidirectional PWs, point-
   to-point co-routed bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point bidirectional 
   Sections, point-to-point associated bidirectional LSPs, point-to-
   point unidirectional LSPs, and point-to-multipoint LSPs. In 
   addition, MPLS-TP OAM supports these LSPs and PWs when they span 
   single domain or multiple domains. 
 
   The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the underlying 
   tunneling or point-to-point technology or transmission media. The 
   protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the service a PW may 
   emulate. 
    
   In-band OAM MUST be implemented. OAM packets for a specific PW, 
   LSP, or Section MUST follow the exact same data path as user 
   traffic of the same.   
    
   The solutions MUST support OAM functions with or without relying on 
   IP capabilities.  
    
   It is REQUIRED that OAM interoperability be achieved between 
   distinct domains with different operational models, e.g. with IP or 
   without IP support in the data plane.  
    
   And OAM functions MUST be configurable even in the absence of a 
   control plane. 
       
   3.2. Functional Requirements  
    
   In general, MPLS-TP OAM tools MUST provide functions to detect, 
   diagnose, localize, and notify the faults when occur. The mechanism 
   for correction actions trigged by fault detection SHOULD be 
   provided. 
    
   The following are the fault detection functional requirements 
    
   - Continuity Checks: a function to enable an End Point to monitor 
   the liveness of a PW, LSP, or Section. 
     
                                                              [Page 6] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP OAM-Toolset                                    March 2011 
    
    
   - Connectivity Verifications: a function to enable an End Point to 
   determine whether or not it is connected to specific End Point(s) 
   by means of the expected PW, LSP, or Section.  
    
   - Route Tracing: the functionality to enable an End Point to 
   discover the Intermediate (if any) and End Point(s) along a PW, 
   LSP, or Section, and more generically to trace the route of a PW, 
   LSP or Section. 
 
   - Diagnostic Tests: a function to enable conducting diagnostic 
   tests on a PW, LSP, or Section.  For example, a loop-back function. 
    
   - Lock Instruct: the functionality to enable an End Point of a PW, 
   LSP, or Section to instruct its associated End Point(s) to lock the 
   PW, LSP, or Section. 
    
   - Lock Reporting: a function to enable an Intermediate Point of a 
   PW or LSP to report, to an End Point of that same PW or LSP, a lock 
   condition indirectly affecting that PW or LSP. 
    
   - Alarm Reporting: the functionality to enable an Intermediate 
   Point of a PW or LSP to report, to an End Point of that same PW or 
   LSP, a fault or defect condition indirectly affecting that PW or 
   LSP. 
    
   - Remote Defect Indication: a function to enable an End Point to 
   report, to its associated End Point, a fault or defect condition 
   that it detects on a PW, LSP, or Section for which they are the End 
   Points. 
    
   - Client Failure Indication: a function to enable the propagation, 
   from edge to edge of an MPLS-TP network, of information pertaining 
   to a client fault condition detected at an End Point of a PW or 
   LSP, if the client layer OAM does not provide alarm notification. 
    
   - Packet Loss Measurement: a function to enable the quantification 
   of packet loss ratio over a PW, LSP, or Section. 
    
   - Packet Delay Measurement: a function to enable the quantification 
   of the one-way, and if appropriate, the two-way, delay ratio of a 
   PW, LSP, or Section.

   The following subsections provide the summary of MPLS-TP OAM Fault 
   Management and Performance Management toolset, with indication of 
   the corresponding IETF RFCs (or Internet drafts while this document 
     
                                                              [Page 7]

   is work in progress) to support the MPLS-TP OAM functions defined 
   in RFC 5860. 
    
    
   4.1. In-band OAM Mechanisms 
 
   To meet the In-band OAM requirements for MPLS-TP, Generic 
   Associated Channel is created [RFC 5586]. It generalizes the 
   applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header 
   (ACH) to MPLS Label Switching Paths (LSPs), and Sections. 
    
   The Generic Associated Label (GAL) [RFC 5586] is defined by 
   assigning one of the reserved MPLS label values to the G-Ach, GAL 
   identifies the presence of the Associated Channel Header following 
   the label stack. 
    
   The creation of G-Ach and GAL provided the necessary mechanisms for 
   building in-band OAM MPLS-TP toolset. 
    
   RFC 5718 [RFC 5718] An-In-Band Data Communication Network for the 
   MPLS Transport Profile describes how the G-Ach may be used for 
   Management and Signaling Communication. 
 
    
   4.2. Fault Management Toolset  
    
   The following tables provide the summary of MPLS-TP OAM toolset. 
    
   Table 1 provides the summary of MPLS-TP OAM Fault Management 
   toolset functions, associated tool/protocol, and the corresponding 
   IETF RFCs or Internet drafts where they are defined.

5. OAM Toolset Utilization and Protocol Definitions 
    
   5.1. Connectivity Check and Connectivity Verification 
    
   Continuity Check (CC) and Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) 
   functions are used to detect loss of continuity (LOC), and 
   unintended connectivity between two MEPs.  
    
   Loss of connectivity, mis-merging, mis-connectivity, or unexpected 
   Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs) can be detected using 
   the CC/CV tools. 
    
   The CC/CV tools are used to support MPLS-TP fault management, 
   performance management, and protection switching. 
 
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) and LSP Ping are defined 
   to support the CC/CV functions [cc-cv]. 
 
   BFD control packets are sent by the source MEP to sink MEP. The 
   sink MEP monitors the arrival of the BFD control packets and 
   detects the defect. 
    
   The interval of BFD control packet can be configured. For example:   
     
                                                             [Page 10] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP OAM-Toolset                                    March 2011 
    
        - 3.3ms is the default interval for protection switching. 
        - 100ms is the default interval for performance monitoring. 
        - 1s is the default interval for fault management. 
    
 
   5.2. Diagnostic Tests and Lock Instruct 
    
   The OAM functions to support diagnostic tests are required in the 
   transport environment.  
    
   The Loopback mode is defined for management purpose in [li-lb]. The 
   mechanism is provided to Lock and unlock traffic (e.g. data and 
   control traffic) or specific OAM traffic at a specific LSR on the 
   path of the MPLS-TP LSP to allow loop back it to the source by [li-
   lb]. 
    
   These diagnostic functions apply to associated bidirectional MPLS-
   TP LSPs, including MPLS-TP LSPs, bi-directional RSVP-TE tunnels 
   (which is relevant for MPLS-TP dynamic control plane option with 
   GMPLS), and single segment and multi-segment pseudowires. 
    
   The Lock operation instruction is carried in an MPLS Loopback 
   request message sent from a MEP to a trail-end MEP of the LSP to 
   request that the LSP be taken out of service.  In response, the 
   Lock operation reply is carried in a Loopback response message sent 
   from the trail-end MEP back to the originating MEP to report the 
   result. 
    
   The loopback operations include [li-lb]:  
        - Lock: take an LSP out of service for maintenance.   
        - Unlock: Restore a previously locked LSP to service. 
        - Set_Full_Loopback and Set_OAM_Loopback 
        - Unset_Full_Loopback and Set_OAM_Loopback 
    
   Operators can use the loopback mode to test the connectivity or 
   performance (loss, delay, delay variation, and throughput) of given 
   LSP upto a specific node on the path of the LSP. 
 
    
   5.3. Lock Reporting  
    
   The Lock Report (LKR) function is used to communicate to the client 
   (sub-) layer MEPs the administrative locking of a server (sub-) 
   layer MEP, and consequential interruption of data traffic 
   forwarding in the client (sub-) layer [fault]. 
    
   When operator is taking the LSP out of service for maintenance 
   other operational reason, using the LKR function can help to 

     
                                                             [Page 11] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP OAM-Toolset                                    March 2011 
    
   distinguish the condition as administrative locking from defect 
   condition.  
    
   The Lock Report function would also serve the purpose of alarm 
   suppression in the MPLS-TP network above the level of the Lock is 
   occurred. The receipt of an LKR message MAY be treated as the 
   equivalent of loss of continuity at the client layer [fault]. 
    
    
   5.4. Alarm Reporting and Link down Indication 
 
    
   Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) message serves the purpose of alarm 
   suppression upon the failure detection in the server (-sub) layer. 
   When the Link Down Indication (RDI) is set, the AIS message MAY be 
   used to trigger recovery mechanisms [fault]. 
    
   When a server MEP detects the failure, it asserts Loss of 
   Continuity (LOC) or signal fail which sets the flag up to generate 
   OAM packet with AIS message. The AIS message is forwarded to 
   downstream sink MEP in the client layer. This would enable the 
   client layer to suppress the generation of secondary alarms.  
 
   A Link Down Indication (LDI) flag is defined in the AIS message. 
   The LDI flag is set in the AIS message in response to detecting a 
   fatal failure in the server layer.  Receipt of an AIS message with 
   this flag set MAY be interpreted by a MEP as an indication of 
   signal fail at the client layer. [fault]  
   Fault OAM messages are generated by intermediate nodes where an LSP 
   is switched, and propagated to the end points (MEPs). 
    
   From practical point of view, when both proactive CC functions and 
   LDI are used, one may consider to run the proactive CC functions at 
   a slower rate (e.g. longer BFD hello intervals), and reply on LDI 
   to trigger fast protection switch over upon failure detection in a 
   given LSP.  
 
    
   5.5. Remote Defect Indication  
    
   Remote Defect Indication (RDI) function enables an End Point to 
   report to the other End Point that a fault or defect condition is 
   detected on the PW, LSP, or Section they are the End Points. 
    
   The RDI OAM function is supported by the use of Bidirectional 
   Forwarding Detection (BFD) Control Packets [cc-cv]. RDI is only 
   used for bidirectional connections and is associated with proactive 
   CC/CV activation. 
     
                                                             [Page 12] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP OAM-Toolset                                    March 2011 
    
    
   When an end point (MEP) detects a signal failure condition, it sets 
   the flag up by setting the diagnostic field of the BFD control 
   packet to a particular value to indicate the failure condition on 
   the associated PW, LSP, or Section, and transmitting the BFD 
   control packet with the failure flag up to the other end point (its 
   peer MEP). 
    
   RDI function can be used to facilitate the protection switching by 
   synchronizing the two end points when unidirectional failure occurs 
   and is detected by one end.  
    
    
   5.6. Packet Loss and Delay Measurement  
 
   Packet loss and delay measurement toolset enables operators to 
   measure the quality of the packet transmission over a PW, LSP, or 
   Section. 
 
   The protocol for MPLS-TP loss and delay measurement functions is 
   defined in [lo-de] as profiled in [tp-lo-de]. These documents 
   specify how to measure Packet Loss, Packet Delay, Packet Delay 
   Variation, and Throughput. 
    
   The loss and delay protocols have the following characteristics and 
   capabilities:  
    
        - Support measurement of packet loss, delay and throughput 
           over Label Switched Paths (LSPs), pseudowires, and MPLS 
           sections (links). 
            
        - The same LM and DM protocols can be used for both 
           continuous/proactive and selective/on-demand measurement.   
      
        - The LM and DM protocols use a simple query/response model 
           for bidirectional measurement that allows a single node - 
           the querier - to measure the loss or delay in both 
           directions. 
      
        - The LM and DM protocols use query messages for 
           unidirectional loss and delay measurement.  The measurement 
           can either be carried out at the downstream node(s) or at 
           the querier if an out-of-band return path is available.  
      
        - The LM and DM protocols do not require that the transmit and 
           receive interfaces be the same when performing bidirectional 
           measurement.  
      

     
                                                             [Page 13] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP OAM-Toolset                                    March 2011 
    
        - The LM protocol supports both 32-bit and 64-bit counters 
           although for simplicity only 32-bit packet counters are 
           currently included in the MPLS-TP profile. 
      
        - The LM protocol supports measurement in terms of both packet 
           counts and octet counts although for simplicity only packet 
           counters are currently included in the MPLS-TP profile.    
      
        - The LM protocol can be used to measure channel throughput as 
           well as packet loss. 
      
        - The DM protocol supports varying the measurement message 
           size in order to measure delays associated with different 
           packet sizes.            
 
    
    
6. IANA assigned code points under G-Ach 
    
   OAM toolset/functions defined under G-Ach MUST use IANA assigned 
   code points, using Experimental Code Point under G-Ach is 
   inappropriate and it can lead to interoperability problems and 
   potential Code Point collision in production network. 
    
   RFC 5586 "MPLS Generic Associated Channel" stated the following in 
   IANA consideration section: A requirement has emerged (see [RFC 
   5860]) to allow for optimizations or extensions to OAM and other 
   control protocols running in an associated channel to be 
   experimented without resorting to the IETF standards process, by 
   supporting experimental code points. This would prevent code points 
   used for such functions from being used from the range allocated 
   through the IETF standards and thus protects an installed base of 
   equipment from potential inadvertent overloading of code points.  
   In order to support this requirement, IANA has changed the code 
   point allocation scheme for the PW Associated Channel as follows: 
    
        0 - 32751: IETF Review 
        32760 - 32767: Experimental 
    
   Code points in the experimental range MUST be used according to the 
   guidelines of RFC 3692 [RFC 3692].  Functions using experimental G-
   Ach code points MUST be disabled by default. 
    
   The guidelines on the usage of experimental numbers are defined in 
   IETF RFC 3692. As indicated by RFC 3692: The experimental numbers 
   are useful when experimenting new protocols or extending existing 
   protocols in order to test and experiment with the new functions, as 
   part of implementation.  RFC 3692 reserves a range of numbers for 

     
                                                             [Page 14] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP OAM-Toolset                                    March 2011 
    
   experimentation when the need of such experimentation has been 
   identified.  
    
   However, the experimental numbers "are reserved for generic testing 
   purposes, and other implementations may use the same numbers for 
   different experimental uses." "Experimental numbers are intended for 
   experimentation and testing and are not intended for wide or general 
   deployments." "Shipping a product with a specific value pre-enabled 
   would be inappropriate and can lead to interoperability problems 
   when the chosen value collides with a different usage, as it someday 
   surely will."  
    
   Further more, "it would be inappropriate for a group of vendors, a 
   consortia, or another Standards Development Organization to agree 
   among themselves to use a particular value for a specific purpose 
   and then agree to deploy devices using those values."  Experimental 
   numbers are not guaranteed to be unique by definition. There is the 
   risk of code point collision when using Experimental Code Point in 
   production networks.  
    
   Similar statements can also be found in RFC4929 "Change Process for 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
   Protocols and Procedures". As described in [RFC 4775], "non-
   standard extensions, including experimental values, are not to be 
   portrayed as industrial standards whether by an individual vendor, 
   an industry forum, or a standards body."

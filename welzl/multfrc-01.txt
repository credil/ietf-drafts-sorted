1.  Introduction

   "TCP-friendliness", the requirement for a flow to behave under
   congestion like a flow produced by a conformant TCP (introduced by
   the name of "TCP-compatibility" in [RFC2309]), has been put into
   question in recent years (cf. [Bri07]).  As an illustrative example,
   consider the fact that not all data transfers are of equal importance
   to a user.  A user may therefore want to assign different priorities
   to different flows between two hosts, but TCP(-friendly) congestion
   control would always let these flows use the same sending rate.
   Users and their applications are now already bypassing TCP-
   friendliness in practice: since multiple TCP flows can better
   saturate a bottleneck than a single one, some applications open
   multiple connections as a simple workaround.  The "GridFTP" [All03]
   protocol explicitly provides this function as a performance
   improvement.

   Some research efforts were therefore carried out to develop protocols
   where a weight can directly be applied to the congestion control
   mechanism, allowing a flow to be as aggressive as a number of
   parallel TCP flows at the same time.  The first, and best known, such
   protocol is MulTCP [Cro+98], which emulates N TCPs in a rather simple
   fashion.  Improved versions were later published, e.g.  Stochastic
   TCP [Hac+04] and Probe-Aided (PA-)MulTCP [Kuo+08].  These protocols
   could be called "N-TCP-friendly", i.e. as TCP-friendly as N TCPs.

   MulTFRC, defined in this document, does with TFRC [RFC5348] what
   MulTCP does with TCP.  In [Dam+09], it was shown that MulTFRC
   achieves its goal of emulating N flows better than MulTCP (and
   improved versions of it) and has a number of other benefits.  For
   instance, MulTFRC with N=2 is more reactive than two real TFRC flows
   are, and it has a smoother sending rate than two real MulTFRC flows
   do.  Moreover, since it is only one mechanism, a protocol that uses
   MulTFRC can send a single data stream with the congestion control
   behavior of multiple data streams without the need to split the data
   and spread it over separate connections.  Depending on the protocol
   in use, N real TFRC flows can also be expected to have N times the
   overhead for, e.g., connection setup and teardown, of a MulTFRC flow
   with the same value of N.

   The core idea of TFRC is to achieve TCP-friendliness by explicitly
   calculating an equation which approximates the steady-state
   throughput of TCP and sending as much as the calculation says.  The
   core idea of MulTFRC is to replace this equation in TFRC with the
   algorithm from [Dam+08], which approximates the steady-state
   throughput of N TCP flows.  MulTFRC can be implemented via a few
   simple changes to the TFRC code.  It is therefore defined here by
   specifying how it differs from the TFRC specification [RFC5348].

2.  Specification

   This section lists the changes to [RFC5348] that must be applied to
   turn TFRC into MulTFRC.  The small number of changes ensures that
   many original properties of a single TFRC flow are preserved, which
   is often the most appropriate choice (e.g. it would probably not make
   sense for a MulTFRC flow to detect a data-limited interval
   differently than a single TFRC flow would).  It also makes MulTFRC
   easy to understand and implement.  Experiments have shown that these
   changes are enough to attain the desired effect.

2.1.  Section 3 of RFC 5348

   While the TCP throughput equation requires the loss event rate,
   round-trip time and segment size as input, the algorithm to be used
   for MulTFRC additionally needs the number of packets lost in a loss
   event.  The equation, specified in [RFC5348] as

                                s
   X_Bps = ----------------------------------------------------------
           R*sqrt(2*b*p/3) + (t_RTO * (3*sqrt(3*b*p/8)*p*(1+32*p^2)))

   is replaced with the following algorithm, which returns X_Bps, the
   average transmit rate of N TCPs in bytes per second:

   If (N < 12) {
       af = N * (1-(1-1/N)^j);
   }
   Else {
       af = j;
   }
   af=max(min(af,ceil(N)),1);
   a = p*b*af*(24*N^2+p*b*af*(N-2*af)^2);
   x= (af*p*b*(2*af-N)+sqrt(a))/(6*N^2*p);
   q=min(2*j*b/(x*(1+3*N/j)),N);
   z=t_RTO*(1+32*p^2)/(1-p);
   If (q*z/(x*R) >= N) {
       q = N;
   } Else {
       q = q*z/(x*R);
   }
   X_Bps = ((1-q/N)/(p*x*R)+q/(z*(1-p)))*s;


   Where:

      s is the segment size in bytes (excluding IP and transport
      protocol headers).

      R is the round-trip time in seconds.

      b is the maximum number of packets acknowledged by a single TCP
      acknowledgement.

      p is the loss event rate, between 0 and 1.0, of the number of loss
      events as a fraction of the number of packets transmitted.

      j is the number of packets lost in a loss event.

      t_RTO is the TCP retransmission timeout value in seconds.

      N is the number of TFRC flows that MulTFRC should emulate.  N is a
      positive rational number; a discussion of appropriate values for
      this parameter, and reasons for choosing them, is provided in
      Section 3.2.

      ceil(N) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to N.

      x, af, a, z and q are temporary floating point variables.

   Section 3.1 of [RFC5348] contains a recommendation for setting a
   parameter called t_RTO.  Here, the use of the algorithm for
   calculating RTO specified in [RFC2988] is RECOMMENDED instead.
   Further, this section proposes a simplification of the equation as a
   result of setting t_RTO in a specific way.  This part of the TFRC
   specification is irrelevant here.  Section 3.1 of [RFC5348] also
   contains a discussion of the parameter b for delayed acknowledgements
   and concludes that the use of b=1 is RECOMMENDED.  This is also the
   case for MulTFRC.

   Section 3.2.2 of [RFC5348] specifies the contents of feedback
   packets.  In addition to the information listed there, a MulTFRC
   feedback packet also carries j, the number of packets lost in a loss
   event.

2.2.  Section 4 of RFC 5348

   The procedure for updating the allowed sending rate in section 4.3 of
   [RFC5348] ("action 4") contains the statement:

   Calculate X_Bps using the TCP throughput equation.

   which is replaced with the statement:

   Calculate X_Bps using the algorithm defined in section 3.

2.3.  Section 5 of RFC 5348

   Section 5.2 of [RFC5348] explains how a lost packet that starts a new
   loss event should be distinguished from a lost packet that is a part
   of the previous loss event interval.  Here, additionally the number
   of packets lost in a loss event is counted, and therefore this
   section is extended with:

   If S_new is a part of the current loss interval LP_0 (the number of
   lost packets in the current interval) is increased by 1.  On the
   other hand, if S_new starts a new loss event, LP_0 is set to 1.

   Section 5.4 of [RFC5348] contains the algorithm for calculating the
   average loss interval that is needed for calculation of the loss
   event rate, p.  MulTFRC also requires the number of lost packets in a
   loss event, j.  In [RFC5348] the calculation of the average loss
   interval is done using a filter that weights the n most recent loss
   event intervals, and setting n to 8 is RECOMMENDED.  The same
   algorithm is used here for calculating the average loss interval.
   For the number of lost packets in a loss event interval, j, the
   weighted average number of lost packets in the n most recent loss
   intervals is taken and the same filter is used.

   For calculating the average number of packets lost in a loss event
   interval we use the same loss intervals as for the p calculation.
   Let LP_0 to LP_k be the number of lost packets in the k most recent
   loss intervals.  The algorithm for calculating I_mean in Section 5.4
   of [RFC5348] (page 23) is extended by adding, after the last line ("p
   = 1 / I_mean;"):

   LP_tot = 0;
   If (I_tot0 > I_tot1) {
       for (i = 0 to k-1) {
             LP_tot = LP_tot + (LP_i * w_i);
       }
   }
   Else {
       for (i = 1 to k) {
             LP_tot = LP_tot + (LP_i * w_i);
       }
   }
   j = LP_tot/W_tot;

   In section 5.5 of [RFC5348] (page 25), the algorithm that ends with
   "p = min(W_tot0/I_tot0, W_tot1/I_tot1);" is extended by adding:

   LP_tot = 0;
   If (I_tot0 > I_tot1) {
       for (i = 0 to k-1) {
           LP_tot = Lp_tot + (LP_i * w_i * DF_i * DF);
       }
       j = LP_tot/W_tot0;
   }
   Else {
       for (i = 1 to k) {
           LP_tot = LP_tot + (LP_i * w_(i-1) * DF_i);
       }
       j = LP_tot/W_tot1;
   }


2.4.  Section 6 of RFC 5348

   The steps to be carried out by the receiver when a packet is received
   in section 6.1 of [RFC5348] ("action 4") contain the statement:

   3)  Calculate p: Let the previous value of p be p_prev.  Calculate
   the new value of p as described in Section 5.

   which is replaced with the statement:

   3)  Calculate p and j: Let the previous values of p and j be p_prev
   and j_prev.  Calculate the new values of p and j as described in
   Section 5.

   The steps to be carried out by the receiver upon expiration of
   feedback timer in section 6.2 of [RFC5348] ("action 1") contain the
   statement:

   1)  Calculate the average loss event rate using the algorithm
          described in Section 5.

   which is replaced with:

   1)  Calculate the average loss event rate and average number of
   lost packets in a loss event using the algorithm described in
   Section 5.

   This statement is added at the beginning of the list of initial steps
   to take when the first packet is received, in section 6.3 of
   [RFC5348]:

   o  Set j = 0.

   Section 6.3.1 of [RFC5348] discusses how the loss history is
   initialized after the first loss event.  TFRC approximates the rate
   to be the maximum value of X_recv so far, assuming that a higher rate
   introduces loss.  Therefore j for this rate is approximated by 1 and
   the number of packets lost in the first interval is set to 1.  This
   is accomplished by the following change.  The first sentence of the
   fourth paragraph (in section 6.3.1) is:

   TFRC does this by finding some value, p, for which the throughput
   equation in Section 3.1 gives a sending rate within 5% of X_target,
   given the round-trip time R, and the first loss interval is then set
   to 1/p.

   which is replaced with:

   TFRC does this by finding some value, p, for which the throughput
   equation in Section 3.1 gives a sending rate within 5% of X_target,
   given the round-trip time R, and j equal to 1. The first loss
   interval is then set to 1/p.

   The second last paragraph in section 6.3.1 ends with:

   Thus, the TFRC receiver calculates the loss interval that would be
   required to produce the target rate X_target of 0.5/R packets per
   second, for the round-trip time R, and uses this synthetic loss
   interval for the first loss interval.  The TFRC receiver uses 0.5/R
   packets per second as the minimum value for X_target when
   initializing the first loss interval.


   which is replaced with:

   Thus, the TFRC receiver calculates the loss interval that would be
   required to produce the target rate X_target of 0.5/R packets per
   second, for the round-trip time R, and for j equal to 1. This
   synthetic loss interval is used for the first loss interval. The TFRC
   receiver uses 0.5/R packets per second as the minimum value for
   X_target when initializing the first loss interval.

2.6.  Appendix A of RFC 5348

   This section provides a terminology list for TFRC, which is extended
   as follows:

   N:  number of emulated TFRC flows.

   j:  number of packets lost in a loss event.


3.  Usage Considerations

   The "weighted fairness" service provided by a protocol using MulTFRC
   is quite different from the service provided by traditional Internet
   transport protocols.  This section intends to answer some questions
   that this new service may raise.

3.1.  Which applications should use MulTFRC?

   Like TFRC, MulTFRC is suitable for applications that require a
   smoother sending rate than standard TCP.  Since it is likely that
   these would be multimedia applications, TFRC has largely been
   associated with them (and [RFC5348] mentions "streaming media" as an
   example).  Since timely transmission is often more important for them
   than reliability, multimedia applications usually do not keep
   retransmitting packets until their successful delivery is ensured.
   Accordingly, TFRC usage was specified for the Datagram Congestion
   Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4342], but not for reliable data
   transfers.

   MulTFRC, on the other hand, provides an altogether different service.
   For some applications, a smoother sending rate may not be
   particularly desirable but might also not be considered harmful,
   while the ability to emulate the congestion control of N flows may be
   useful for them.  This could include reliable transfers such as the
   transmission of files.  Possible reasons to use MulTFRC for file
   transfers include the assignment of priorities according to user
   preferences, increased efficiency with N > 1, the implementation of
   low-priority "scavenger" services, and resource pooling [Wis+08].

3.2.  Setting N

   N MUST be set at the beginning of a transfer; it MUST NOT be changed
   while a transfer is ongoing.  The effects of changing N during the
   lifetime of a MulTFRC session on the dynamics of the mechanism are
   yet to be investigated; in particular, it is unclear how often N
   could safely be changed, and how "safely" should be defined in this
   context.  Further research is required to answer these questions.

Internet-Draft                   MulTFRC                    October 2009


   N is a positive floating point number which can also take values
   between 0 and 1, making MulTFRC applicable as a mechanism for what
   has been called a "Lower-than-Best-Effort" (LBE) service.  Since it
   does not reduce its sending rate early as delay increases like some
   alternative proposals for such a service do (e.g.  TCP-LP [Kuz+06],
   TCP Nice [Ven+02] or 4CP [Liu+07]), it can probably be expected to be
   more aggressive than these mechanisms if they share a bottleneck at
   the same time.  This also means that MulTFRC is less likely to be
   prone to starvation.  Values between 0 and 1 could also be useful if
   MulTFRC is used across multiple paths to realize resource pooling
   [Wis+08].

   Setting N to 1 is also possible.  In this case, the only difference
   between TFRC and MulTFRC is that the underlying model of TFRC assumes
   that all remaining packets following a dropped packet in a "round"
   (less than one round-trip time apart) are also dropped, whereas the
   underlying model of MulTFRC does not have this assumption.  In other
   words, other than the equation used in MulTFRC, the underlying
   equation of TFRC assumes that loss always occurs in bursts.  Which
   choice is better depends on the specific network situation; large
   windows and other queuing schemes than Drop-Tail seem to make it less
   likely for the burst-loss assumption to match reality.  This document
   does not make any recommendation about which mechanism to use if only
   one flow is desired.

   Since TCP has been extensively studied, and the aggression of its
   congestion control mechanism is emulated by TFRC, we can look at the
   behavior of a TCP aggregate in order to find a reasonable upper limit
   for N in MulTFRC.  From [Alt+06], N TCPs (assuming non-sychronized
   loss events over connections) can saturate a bottleneck link by
   roughly 100-100/(1+3N) percent.  This means that a single flow can
   only achieve 75% utilization, whereas 3 flows already achieve 90%.
   The theoretical gain that can be achieved by adding a flow declines
   with the total number of flows - e.g., while going from 1 to 2 flows
   is a 14.3% performance gain, the gain becomes less than 1% beyond 6
   flows (which already achieve 95% link utilization).  Since the link
   utilization of MulTFRC can be expected to be roughly the same as the
   link utilization of multiple TCPs, the approximation above also holds
   for MulTFRC.  Thus, setting N to a much larger value than the values
   mentioned above will only yield a marginal benefit in isolation but
   can significantly affect other traffic.  Therefore, the maximum value
   that a user can set for MulTFRC SHOULD NOT exceed 6.


4.  Security Considerations

   It is well known that a single uncontrolled UDP flow can cause
   significant harm to a large number of TCP flows that share the same

Internet-Draft                   MulTFRC                    October 2009


   bottleneck.  This potential danger is due to the total lack of
   congestion control.  Because this problem is well known, and because
   UDP is easy to detect, UDP traffic will often be rate limited by
   service providers.

   If MulTFRC is used within a protocol such as DCCP, which will
   normally not be considered harmful and will therefore typically not
   be rate-limited, its tunable aggression could theoretically make it
   possible to use it for a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.  In order to
   avoid such usage, the maximum value of N MUST be restricted.  If, as
   recommended in this document, the maximum value for N is restricted
   to 6, the impact of MulTFRC on TCP is roughly the same as the impact
   of 6 TCP flows would be.  It is clear that the conjoint congestion
   control behavior of 6 TCPs is far from being such an attack.

   With transport protocols such as TCP, SCTP or DCCP, users can already
   be more aggressive than others by opening multiple connections.  If
   MulTFRC is used within a transport protocol, this effect becomes more
   pronounced - e.g., 2 connections with N set to 6 for each of them
   roughly exhibit the same congestion control behavior as 12 TCP flows.
   The N limit SHOULD therefore be implemented as a system wide
   parameter such that the sum of the N values of all MulTFRC
   connections does not exceed it.  Alternatively, the number of
   connections that can be opened could be restricted.

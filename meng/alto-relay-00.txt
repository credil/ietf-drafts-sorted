Internet-Draft            ALTO relay usage                    July, 2009

Abstract

   ALTO has been proposed to help peer-to-peer (P2P) applications make 
   better decisions with respect to peer selection. It provides the 
   underlying network view for P2P users to choose the optimal resource 
   instances. The usage of ALTO has covered nearly all the P2P 
   applications, such as file sharing, media streaming, real time 
   communications and etc. In real time communication where the source 
   and destination are fixed, it is used to choose relays. 

   This document defines the relay usage for ALTO in real time 
   communication. Beside the relay for NAT traversal mentioned before, 
   this document introduce a relay called Qos relay to improve the 
   performance. After analyzing the necessity of this type of relay and 
   the benefits of combining ALTO with relay, two models of combination 
   are described according to the coupling tightness between ALTO and 
   relay service. One is called "integrating relay service into alto 
   service" and the other is "cooperation between P2P application 
   provider and ISP". In all, the usage of ALTO in real time 
   communication has been developed in this document.

Internet-Draft            ALTO relay usage                    July, 2009


1.  Introduction

   Network traffic generated by Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications 
   determines a large portion of the overall traffic in the Internet. 
   Because P2P applications have limited information about the 
   underlying network topology, they usually select direct P2P 
   connections in a suboptimal way. As a result, P2P traffic often 
   crosses several ISPs, causes high load and congestion on particular 
   network links, reduces application performance, and generates high 
   costs for ISPs. This problem is discussed and described in detail in 
   the ALTO problem statement[draft-ietf-alto-problem-statement].

   The goal of ALTO is to solve the ALTO problems by providing 
   information which can help peer-to-peer (P2P) applications to make 
   better decisions with respect to peer selection. The ALTO solution 
   provides a logical entity called ALTO server which provides the 
   information and guides the peer selection. The ALTO service provided 
   by ALTO server is most likely deployed by ISP which has the accurate 
   topology information. The ALTO clients are possibly the P2P 
   application users who try to receive good experiences by locating 
   suitable peers or resource providers. 

   ALTO service can be applied in many scenarios. The ALTO problem 
   statement[draft-ietf-alto-problem-statement] has listed five usecases 
   of ALTO service: file sharing, live media streaming, real time 
   communication, DHTs and cache/mirror selection. In the five cases, 
   ALTO service is mainly used to sort multiple destinations in the P2P 
   communication. For example, a user would locate the proximatepeer 
   with the help of ALTO according to underlying network topology among 
   a group of resource instances. But in real time communication, the 
   source and destination are fixed. Under this circumstance, ALTO 
   service would only help peers to choose relay, which acts as a bridge 
   in the application layer between the source and destination.

   The relay mentioned in the ALTO problem statement [draft-ietf- alto-
   problem-statement] is applied to connect users with limited access to 
   the Internet (e.g. users behind NATs, firewalls or HTTP proxies). 
   ALTO would help them find the best relays to relay the media flows. 
   We call this type of relay as "connectivity relay", which is used to 
   guarantee the connectivity of real time communication. This document 
   proposes another type of relay, which can be used to improve 
   performance of real time communication, called "Qos relay" here. This 
   document would describe the background of Qos relay and design the 
   mechanism of combining ALTO service with relay. On the basis of the 
   tightness of coupling between ALTO and relay service, we put forward 
   two methods to apply ALTO solution for relay to improve performance 
   of real time communication.

2.  The necessity of relay in the P2P real time communication

   We argue that two types of relay are needed in P2P real time 
   communication, which include the connectivity relay and Qos relay. 
   Here the necessity of relay would be formulated to show that relay is 
   generally useful. Additionally, the benefits of combining ALTO 
   service with relay service is generalized, which expands the range of
   application of ALTO.

2.1.  Connectivity relay 

   P2P real time communication allows users to establish direct media 
   flows, usually to place audio and video calls, or to have text chats. 
   In the basic case, media would flow directly between the two 
   endpoints; however, in the general case, a significant portion of 
   communications between users with limited access to the Internet 
   (e.g. users behind NATs, firewalls or HTTP proxies) need to be 
   relayed by other elements. Such media relays are distributed over the 
   Internet -- in some cases co-located with applications with a public 
   address; the goal of an ALTO solution would be to help peers find the 
   best relays[draft-alto-problem-statement]. We call this type of relay 
   as connectivity relay which aims to guarantee the connectivity of the 
   endpoints of real time communication. This type of relay is widely 
   used, but not the focus of our document.

2.2.  Qos relay

   This document stresses upon another type of relay, which can be used 
   to improve performance of real time communication, called Qos relay 
   here. Its existence comes from the phenomenon of anti-triangular in 
   Internet. Because of the quality requirements of real time 
   communication and this widely existing phenomenon, Qos relay is of 
   great significance and impact.

2.2.1.  The phenomenon of anti-triangular

   Among all of the sessions on the internet, there are always some 
   sessions with direct IP routing RTTs which exceed the RTT threshold 
   for quality VoIP communication. For these sessions, it is likely to 
   find one-hop overlay relay paths to reduce the RTTs. The RTTs of 
   these relay paths are less than those of the direct IP routing paths. 
   This is called as the phenomenon of anti-triangular.

   IP routing on the Internet is dependent on the provider-customer and 
   peer-peer commercial contractual relationships between neighboring 
   Autonomous Systems (AS) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Usually
   a provider AS transits traffic for a customer AS, while a customer AS
   does not transit traffic for its provider AS. Constrained by this 
   rule, an Internet AS-level routing path usually has the valley-free 
   property. Because each AS can enforce its own routing policy, the 
   direct IP routing path between two end hosts is not necessarily the 
   optimal one among all possible routing paths between them, including 
   overlay routing paths. Under the following two conditions, overlay 
   routing paths can be faster than the direct IP routing paths[SL06].
   
   (1) An AS in a direct routing path is congested or failed.
    
   Consider a session between two end hosts in AS A and AS B. The direct 
   IP routing path between them contains AS C which is congested. If 
   there is a one-hop relay overlay routing path between AS A and AS B 
   through AS D which does not contain the congested AS C on the IP 
   routing path, this relay path will be faster than the direct IP 
   routing path. Even worsely, the direct routing path may contain 
   failed ASes, while needs to be bypassed by overlay routing path. In 
   these cases, overlay routing latency can be shorter than the direct 
   IP routing path. 
   
   (2) Multi-homed customer ASes can further improve overlay routing.
    
   A multi-homed customer AS connecting to multiple upstream provider 
   ISPs can act as the intermediary relay to transit traffic for its 
   provider ISPs, and this one-hop relay path can have shorter AS hops 
   than the direct IP routing path. Considering the AS graph in 
   Figure 1, an AS B has multi-homed connections to two providers AS D 
   and AS E. For the two end hosts in AS A and AS C, the direct IP 
   routing path between them is A-D-F-H-I-G-E-C, which has 7 AS hops, 
   while the overlay routing path through AS B is A-D-B-E-C, which has 
   only 4 AS hops, 3 hops shorter. As the path latency is correlated to 
   the AS hops on this path, the RTT of overlay routing is highly likely 
   to be shorter than that of direct IP routing despite of the relay 
   delay at AS B.

2.2.2  The benefits of combining ALTO service with relay service

   In P2P applications, the underlay topology is very limited known, 
   which results in the suboptimal choice of peers and unnecessary waste 
   of network resources. For relay service, P2P application needs to do 
   a lot of measurements to choose the suitable relays. If ALTO service 
   is combined with relay service, we can get reliable and accurate 
   information from the ISPs, including accurate AS topology, link cost 
   and QoS parameters. Both ISPs and P2P applications can benefit from 
   the combination. The introduction of ALTO service makes the relay 
   selection process and the overlay routing under the control of ISPs, 
   which avoids the traffic congestion and confusion of selection of 
   nodes in P2P network which is lack of management. It also reduces the 
   costs of measurements for P2P applications because many parameters
   can be obtained from the ALTO server.

3.  The model of combining ALTO service with relay service

   The idea of combining ALTO service with relay service can be 
   implemented in two models. Here two models are illustrated. The two 
   models are different in the tightness of coupling between ALTO and 
   relay. For the first model, ALTO server accounts for both the 
   management and ranking of relay candidate lists. Relay service is 
   tightly coupled with alto service. We call this model as "integrating 
   relay service into alto service". For the second model, ALTO server 
   is unaware of relay peer. The P2P application provides relay 
   candidate lists and ALTO server only sorts it considering topological 
   proximity. The coupling relationship between ALTO and relay is 
   relatively loose. It reflects the cooperation between ISP and P2P 
   application providers. ALTO server provides the P2P application 
   provider the necessary underlying network information to help choose 
   the suitable relay candidates. We call this model as "cooperation 
   between P2P application provider and ISP".

3.1 Integrating relay service into alto service 

   As the anti-triangular phenomenon widely exists in Internet, relay 
   service can be deemed as an important tool for application layer 
   traffic optimization, which means ALTO server would take the relay 
   service into its functional components. In this model, the relay 
   candidate lists are maintained in ALTO servers.  An ALTO server is a 
   logical entity that provides interfaces to query the alto service. 
   The ALTO server may integrate relay service into alto service to 
   improve client's performance or quality of service. ALTO clients can 
   query the ALTO server for the list of available relay peers or 
   servers. 
   An illustration of the architecture is presented in the following 
   figure.

   2> Peer 1 sends a relay notification to peer 2 via direct path. 
   3> After receiving from peer 1,peer 2 sends a relay request to ALTO 
   server 2. Server 2 does the same as in step1. 
   4> ALTO server 2 sends the relay information to ALTO server 1, 
   server 1 will do an intersection operation between its own relay 
   information and the received relay information, and then obtain the 
   relay candidate list. 
   5> ALTO server 1 returns the relay list to peer 1. Peer 1 measures 
   the QoS value to those candidates in the list. 
   6> ALTO server 1 returns the relay candidate list to ALTO server2. 
   7> ALTO server 2 returns the relay candidate list to peer 2, and 
   peer 2 measures the QoS value to those candidates in the list. 
   8> peer 2 returns the measuring results to peer 1.
   
   Based on the measuring results, peer 1 will determine the best relay
   peer.

3.1.4.  Measurements

   Measurements in the system mainly consist of AS topology measurements 
   and QoS value measurements. AS topology measurements contain adjacent 
   AS hops and other connection relationship information. 
   
   QoS value includes delay, jitter, loss rate etc from peers to relays.
   Source and destination should both measure the Qos values to relays. 
   The destination gives the results to the source which will deal with 
   them and filter the suitable relays.
   
3.2.  Cooperation between P2P application provider and ISP

   We define another model which is compatible with the current ALTO 
   architecture. The relay service is not integrated but considered as 
   the ordinary peer selection process. The peer would provide the ALTO 
   server with the relay candidate list, and the ALTO server would rank 
   the list. Here the relay candidate list is provided and maintained by
   P2P application providers. P2P software users might configure or 
   cache this list before querying ALTO server. The relay candidate 
   discovery mechanism might be designed by P2P application providers.
   After receiving the ranked list, the end users negotiate with each 
   other and choose the most suitable relay according to the ALTO server 
   response.

Internet-Draft            ALTO relay usage                    July, 2009 

       
   The ALTO goal here is not only for traffic localization but also for 
   improving the Qos. ALTO server might use BGP routing information to 
   calculate the preference of relay candidates that P2P application 
   provides. The rating method can be seen in [draft-racz-bgp-based-
   alto-service]. In P2P real time communication, P2P application 
   providers has deployed relay candidate peers or servers, then ALTO 
   server assists the users to select relay to reduce inter-domain 
   traffic and achieve a more efficient inter-domain traffic pattern 
   between ISPs. It is meaningful to both P2P application and ISPs.
   
   The flow chart of P2P real time communication with the cooperation 
   between ISP and P2P application providers can be seen as follows:

   p1        ALTO server1              ALTO server2       p2
    |              |                         |             |
    |------1------>|                         |             |
    |<------2------|                         |             |
    |--------------|-------------3-----------|------------>|
    |              |                         |<-----4------|
    |              |                         |-------5---->|
    |<-------------|-------------6-----------|-------------|                                
    |              |                         |             | 
    
            Figure 4  Example of cooperation model
            
   Figure 4 shows an example of cooperation model. Peer 1 have 
   established a session to peer2 and it measures the direct path QoS 
   value. 
   
   1> If peer 1 needs relay(direct Qos value are not satisfactory), 
   peer 1 sends the relay candidate lists to ALTO server1.After 
   receiving, ALTO server1 ranks the lists according to its policy or
   topological proximity information. 
   2>ALTO server 1 returns the ranked list to peer 1, and peer 1 
   measures the QoS value to those candidates in the relay list. 
   3> Peer1 sends a relay notification to peer2 via direct path. 
   4> After Peer2 receives the notification from peer 1, it sends the 
   relay candidate list to ALTO server2. Server2 does the same as in 
   step1. 
   5> ALTO server 2 returns the ranked list to peer 2, and peer 2 
   measures the QoS value to those candidates in the relay list. 
   6>Peer 2 returns the measuring results to peer 1. 

   Based on the measuring results, peer 1 will determine the best relay
   peer. A possible measure is to intersect the received peer 2's relay
   list and peer 1's own relay list to choose the best relay.

   This model needs the cooperation between P2P application providers 
   and ISPs. P2P application providers would provide the relay lists 
   they maintain and asks ISPs to help the selection. The ISPs would 
   sort the candidates according to both the policy and topological 
   proximity. The results would be sent back to end users, who would 
   decide whether or which to choose. The cooperation between the two 
   parties would result in better relay selection and further improve 
   the Qos of P2P real time communication.

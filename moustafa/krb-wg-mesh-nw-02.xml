    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents the problem of authentication and authorization in wireless mesh networks constituted by
several users communicating with application servers and communicating with each other in a single or multi-hop fashion.  
Each user in this environment can also play the role of an application provider.</t>

<t>Imagine a large music event where the provided network infrastructure
is enhanced with network storage equipment to allow visitors to
access content relating to the bands playing at the events, such as
recorded video of previous performances, supplementary audio and
video material relevant to the bands playing, etc.  Certain content
is, however, not necessarily available to everyone under the same
conditions.  Instead access control is applied before the full range
of audio, and video material can be accessed.  Other content, such as
previews, might be offered for free.  How can such authentication,
and authorization infrastructure be made available with minimal
configuration complexity for a temporary event like a music festival?</t>     

<t>This document lists the requirements for a potentially needed Kerberos extension and presents a solution proposal based on the attempt to
use a Kerberos extension for mutual authentication in wireless mesh networks.</t>

    <section title="Introduction and Problem Statement">

      <t>Authentication and authorization to services access is still an open
   problem in wireless mesh network distributed environments in which 
   several users would need to communicate to several application servers 
   and with each other in a single or multi-hop fashion, and each user 
   could play the role of an application provider.</t>  

	<t>The Kerberos authentication model <xref target="RFC4120"/> uses a symmetric
   cryptography approach, offering a high security level and
   allowing mutual authentication. The principle of using service 
   tickets in Kerberos allows for credentials distribution which is 
   suitable for wireless mesh networks distributed environments.  
   However, the centralized approach in Kerberos (where
   each user should communicate with the authentication server each time
   he needs services credentials) restricts its usage for authentication
   in such distributed environments. Furthermore, Kerberos rather 
   authenticates each node with respect to the authentication server and 
   to the application server. The distributed credentials principle in 
   Kerberos (through Service tickets) is promising for allowing 
   authentication between each user and the application.  However, the    
   authentication between each two users who communicate with each other 
   is still not covered by Service tickets, especially with the dynamic 
   nature of distributed environments in which users connectivity (that 
   could be single or multi-hop) change frequently with time.</t>
      
      <t>Although the multi-hop communication is transparent to the application, there is a need to handle the authentication 
	and access control among the different multi-hop communicating nodes to prevent against 
	malicious actions taken by the human users themselves. Based on this fact, this draft proposes to use a common key 
	obtained by Kerberos for authentication among each two nodes who communicate together in a multi-hop 
        fashion. This common key is dynamic (renewable with time) for security reasons in such dynamic and 
        distributed wireless environment that is less secure. </t>

<section title="Kerberos Extension Solution Proposal">
      <t>This section presents a solution proposal extending the Kerberos authentication model for authenticating each user
node in wireless mesh networks with respect to the network operator and with respect to other users nodes participating in
 the network. </t>

<t>The Kerberos server resides in the local mesh network or in an external network and each user node needs to communicate
 firstly with this server in order to authenticate with respect to the operator and to obtain the necessary credentials 
(Kerberos tickets) for authentication with other users nodes and for accessing the offered services in the mesh network. 
The communication can take place in a single hop or through multi-hops (passing by intermediate users nodes) according to 
the proximity of each user node from the application providers nodes. </t>

<t>To prevent unreliable communication from taking place (intermediate nodes could do DoS, messages truncating,...), this solution 
proposal extends the classical Kerberos authentication model to adapt to the multi-hop communication through introducing a 
new shared secret for authentication and access control between intermediate nodes along the multi-hop communication. But, if
this secret is the same for all the time, it could be compromised and the entire network would be compromised. It is then proposed in this draft
to obtain several shared secrets during the service ticket request for the service for which the multihop communication is needed.</t>

<t> The solution proposal takes the following sequence:<list style="symbols">


          <t>Each user node wishing to access the services offered by the mesh network starts by sending a first request 
to the KDC (TGT part) in order to authenticate with respect to the operator and to obtain the TGT ticket. The process is 
similar to the classical Kerberos authentication approach, and the user, if legitimate, obtains the corresponding TGT ticket.</t>
          <t>After obtaining the TGT, the user node re-contacts the KDC (TGS part), through sending a TGS request, in order
to obtain the necessary credentials (including the service ticket for the service for which multihop communication will be employed in addition to
the shared secrets for authentication during the multihop communication) while presenting the obtained TGT ticket as a proof of authenticity. The classical
Kerberos TGS request should be extended to illustrate the need of extra credentials for authentication with intermediate nodes along 
the multi-hop communication. The following figure illustrates this extension, where a new flag is defined in the flags
field in the reserved bits between bits 12 and 25 taking the value 1 to indicate the case of Kerberos in the multi-hop mode.</t>

      </t>

	  <t>Once the KDC (TGS part), receiving the TGS request from the user, verifies the TGT ticket and the user authenticity,
it sends to the user the Kerberos TGS reply message extended to contain the necessary credentials according to the user profile and 
according to the required service.</t>
          <t>The extended Kerberos TGS reply message includes the service ticket for the service for which the multihop wommunication will
be employed as well as the shared secrets.</t>
	  <t>To avoid the shared secret compromise, several shared secrets are obtained, where each shared secret is valid for a given time interval. However, the shared secret distributions
should be done in a mean that would not compromise the security of the whole network:<list style="symbols">
<t>If the shared secrets are required by each mesh node at each time interval, this would generate lot of traffic during 
the communication with the KDC.</t>
<t>If the shared secrets for future time intervals are pre-generated by the KDC and given in batch to each user, this would 
optimize traffic, but if a node is compromised at an interval of time, all the shared secrets would be known and the network 
would be compromised.</t>
</list></t>
          <t>Then, the KDC sends to each mesh node in the extended TGS reply message the current interval shared secret and the pre-generated ones for the 
future, while each pre-generated shared secret is encrypted with a key corresponding to the its related time interval. This 
encryption key should be sent to each mesh node in the corresponding time interval either through Kerberos protocol or through
a multicast routing protocol. The following figure illustrates the extended TGS reply message. In this extended message: i) a new flag is defined in the flags
field in the reserved bits between bits 14 and 31 taking the value 1 to indicate the case of Kerberos in the multi-hop mode. ii) a new field authorized-data
is added which is identical to the authorization data field existing in the service ticket and containing elements, where the first element contains the 
current time interval in its (type) part and the corresponding shared key to this interval in its (data part). The other elements contains the upcoming time
intervals and the corresponding shared keys in an encrypted form as explained above.</t>

          <t> Group keys can be also considered allowing to have a shared secret for each group of mesh nodes and allowing 
each mesh node to participate to more than one group and hence to have several group keys. If one group key is compromised it
could be deleted by the KDC. Mesh nodes sharing the same group key are mesh nodes sharing some common characteristics (making
a cluster, hierarchal group keys for example, ...).</t>

<section title="Potential Use-cases">
      
<t>This section presents the potential use-cases for distributed    environments of wireless mesh networks having multi-hop communication  
and requiring distributed authentication authorization.<list style="symbols">

   <t>Temporary network infrastructure deployment for special events (sport events, music festivals, ..). Network operators
 deploy temporary low-cost infrastructure for temporary events and hence counts on the communication of users with application
 servers that are locally deployed.  Also the users themselves can play the role of application providers contributing to the
 diffusion of multimedia services (video snapshots on the event,video streams with inserted comments, video streaming for what was
 missed in the event, downloading an interactive audio-visual program for the event,. ..).  In such use-case, there is a need
 for dynamic credentials distribution on the different participating nodes and there is also a need of controlling the
 access of each user to the authorized service for a duration corresponding to his subscription.</t>


   <t>Community networks, where a user owns the home gateway to the Internet and allows other distributed users to have access to the
      Internet through passing by his home gateway.  Users may need to pass by other users (in the community network) in order to reach
      the home gateway.  In this use-case, there is a need for credentials distribution in a dynamic manner (adapting to the
      random configuration of the community network) to allow mutual authentication between each pair of communicating users and
      between each user and the home gateway providing the Internet access.</t>

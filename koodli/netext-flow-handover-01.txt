Internet-Draft                Flow Handover                 October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Interface multihoming is becoming increasingly common.  Mobile Nodes
   are being equipped with multiple Wide Area Network (WAN) radios as
   well as Local Area Network (LAN) radio (such as WiFi).  In a Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain [RFC5213], a single Local Mobility Anchor (LMA)
   could support a Mobile Node (MN) which is simultaneously attached to
   multiple Mobility Access Gateways (MAGs) through multiple interfaces.
   The PMIP6 protocol provides the mobility support in such an
   enviroment when a MN actually changes its network interfaces.  This
   document specifies a protocol between the LMA and a MAG to handover
   one or more application flows from an interface to another even when
   the MN does not physically switch its network interface.

   Flow handover, in which a network entity induces handover for one or
   more application flows, could provide better network experience for
   end users by transparently moving an application flow to the network
   that can best serve the particular application flow.  Flow handover
   could also enable a network operator to dynamically balance the load
   appropriately depending on the availability of network capacity.  For
   example, the LMA may induce a handover for "www" application from
   cellular radio to WiFi, while retaining the VoIP on the cellular
   network.

   This document assumes that handover control logic resides at the LMA;
   however, the trigger for protocol could initiate from the MAG.  The
   LMA maintains appropriate policy profiles that describe the
   applications and networks that best serve them.  The LMA also has
   access to MN-specific policy information.  Details of such policy
   profiles are beyond the scope of this document.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL", in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The document uses the terminology specified in [RFC5213] and in
   [RFC3775].  In addition, this document defines the following:

      Flow Handover: Network-initiated handover of one or more
      application flows from one network interface to another, without
      necessarily requiring the change of network interface at the MN.

      Flow Handover Request (FHRQ): A message sent by the LMA requesting
      a MAG to establish forwarding for one or more application flows of
      a MN.

Internet-Draft                Flow Handover                 October 2009



      Flow Handover Reply (FHRP): A reply from the MAG to the LMA
      containing the resolution of FHRQ message.

      Source MAG (S-MAG): The Mobility Access Gateway where a MN
      originates its application flow.

      Target MAG (T-MAG): The Mobility Access Gateway to which the LMA
      relocates one or more application flows (from the S-MAG).



3.  Protocol

   The protocol specified here assumes that a MN has simultaneous
   connectivity with multiple networks which are anchored at the same
   LMA.  Hence, the LMA maintains multiple PMIP6 session bindings
   corresponding to each of the attachments, containing unique IPv6 Home
   Network Prefixes and/or IPv4 Home Addresses.  A special case for the
   protocol specified here is when the same HNP is used across multiple
   interfaces; the behavior is the same as described in the following.

   When a new application flow is initiated (e.g., either through out of
   band signaling or through connection set up as in TCP) the LMA
   verifies whether the application flow is "best-mapped" to interfaces
   that could serve them.  This verification could be based on the
   application policy profiles (that could specify the priority ordering
   of networks best-suited to support the applications) and the MN-
   specific policy profiles (which are dependent on the subscription
   records).  Both application profiles and MN-specific profiles are
   operator-configurable, and are not specified in this document.  In
   any case, if the application flows are already best-mapped to their
   corresponding interfaces, the LMA does nothing.  If not, this
   verification serves as a flow handover trigger for further protocol
   actions described in the following.

   As a response to the flow handover trigger, the LMA constructs a Flow
   Handover Request (FHRQ) message containing the MN-Identifier and a
   flow tuple (including the IPv6 HNP/IPv4 HoA, transport protocol port
   numbers and QoS parameters for uplink and downlink) to the target MAG
   (T-MAG).  Note that such a flow tuple is established on the source
   MAG (S-MAG), and hence is likely to have HNP and IPv4 HoA different
   from the ones allocated for the MN on the target MAG.  The LMA sends
   the FHRQ message to the T-MAG.

   The T-MAG verifies that it can support the requested flow.  It then
   creates a Flow Forwarding Entry (FFE) that contains the parameters
   provided by the LMA in the FHRQ message.  The FFE is in addition to



Koodli & Chowdhury       Expires April 17, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                Flow Handover                 October 2009


   the Binding Update List Entry (BULE) that the MAG may have for the
   MN.  The FFE is used to forward packets for the specified flow only;
   however, wildcard parameters may be used to identify a set of flows.

   The flow forwarding is not permanent.  For instance, the LMA may send
   a FHRQ message with a request to terminate an existing FFE.  Such a
   message may be generated as a result of termination of an application
   flow.  The flow forwarding also has a default lifetime, upon the
   expiry of which the forwarding reverts to the normal PMIP6-based
   tunneling (involving the LMA and the source MAG).  When flow
   forwarding service ceases, the corresponding FFE entries MUST be
   removed.

   The T-MAG provides a resolution of the FHRQ processing in the Flow
   Handover Reply (FHRP) message.  This Mobility Header message includes
   the MN-IDentifier and flow tuple (including the IPv6 HNP/IPv4 HoA,
   transport protocol port numbers and QoS parameters for uplink and
   downlink) as well as an appropriate Status code disposing the outcome
   of FHRQ processing.  Status code 0 indicates flow forwarding is
   offered by the T-MAG.  Any other value for Status code indicates the
   reason for not offering the flow forwarding service.

   When Status code in FHRP is 0, the LMA creates its own Flow
   Forwarding Entry (FFE).  The FFE over-rides the BCE for the
   identified application flow(s).  In other words, application traffic
   matching the flow tuple is forwarded to T-MAG.  Only the subset of
   the application traffic that matches the flow parameters is forwarded
   to T-MAG; the rest of the traffic is sent to S-MAG according to the
   BCE.

   At any point in time, the T-MAG may send an Unsolicited FHRP (U-FHRP)
   message to indicate events such as FFE lifetime renewal or a MN
   moving out of coverage.  The LMA sends an FHRQ message to confirm the
   renewal of FFE lifetime.  When the event indicates a MN moving out of
   coverage, the LMA sends FHRQ to cancel an existing flow forwarding
   service.  In any case, the T-MAG MUST wait for the FHRQ message to
   confirm the corresponding action by the LMA before concluding on its
   own.  When flow forwarding service is cancelled, forwarding takes
   place according to the normal PMIP6 tunneling.

   The decision to handover the flow from one interface to another may
   be conveyed to the MN using access-specific signaling.  In the
   absence of such signaling, the MN needs to be prepared to accept
   packets on an interface other than the one which initiated the
   application flow in the first place.

4.3.  Mobility Options

4.3.1.  IPv6 Address/Prefix

   This option is the same as the Home Network Prefix option specified
   in [RFC5213].  An address is specified with Prefix Length set to 128
   bits.  This option is used as the source or destination IP address
   field in the flow tuple.

4.3.2.  IPv4 Address

   This option is used for an IPv4 flow.  It has an alignment
   requirement of 4n.

4.3.4.  QoS Parameters

   A Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) [RFC3140] Class parameter is defined whose
   format is the same as in [dime-qos].  New QoS parameters may be
   defined in the future.


5.  Security Considerations

   The protocol specified in this document uses the same security
   association between the LMA and the MAG to protect the FHRQ and FHRP
   messages.  No new security risks are identified.  Support for
   integrity protection using IPsec is required, but support for
   confidentiality is not necessary.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The Flow Handover Request, described in Section 4.1 and the Flow
   Handover Reply, described in Section 4.2 require a single Mobility
   Header Type from the registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters:

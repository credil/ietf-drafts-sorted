           Considerations of software generated message on XMPP
                  draft-sato-xmpp-software-message-01

Abstract

   In RFC2779 [RFC2779] and RFC2778 [RFC2778], XMPP [RFC3920] client
   is defined as "PRINCIPALS are the people, groups, and/or software
   in the "real world" outside the system that use the system as a
   means of coordination and communication.  Considering this
   description, it does not matter whether the user of end node is
   human or software. However, current specification of XMPP is
   expected that there will be a human in front of the client. So,
   there is no consideration for looping the message between softwares
   and processing message that human will not be able to react.
   Recently system and software are replying in return of
   human. Moreover, by making client act like a human, new network
   service can be made.  There are many of these called "bots"
   already, but there is a possibility which can aggregate or control
   remote resources.By clarifying models of usage and problem, this
   document aims to use XMPP in software-to-software and
   human-to-software models not only human-to-human model.

Internet-Draft            XMPP Software Message               March 2010

1. Background

  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol has been designed for
  sending presence and instant messaging. XMPP are expected using in
  high latency, low bandwidth and possibly intermittent connectivity
  such as mobile wireless access.

  According to the definition of RFC 2778, PRINCIPAL are people,
  groups, and/or software. These days bots and agent softwares are
  sending message as a transport protocol. For example, some TV boxes
  uses XMPP between Remote and box.  XMPP can be used to as a
  messaging protocol for machine to machine communication. For this
  usage, fail-proofed will be a good thing for developer of clients.


2. Models of usage of XMPP

2.1 Basic Models

  Before start discussing the problem, we would like to define 3
  models which will be useful to imagine what is happening in next
  chapter. In this document, we will discuss following models

  o Human to Human
  When both PRINCIPALs are human, communication between them are just
  as current usage. This is current basic model of jabber instant
  messaging.

  o Humans to Software
  Think of a model one side of principal is a software and the other
  side is human.

  o Software to Software
  Both principal is software. Messages and presence are handled by
  only software which run at both side.

2.2 Possible model of MUC

  Considering MUC, there can be following models, but these will not
  be covered by this document.

                 Human,        Few Software,   Many Software
  Human          ---,          MUC-case-1,     MUC-case-2
  Few Software   MUC-case-1,   MUC-case-3,     MUC-case-4
  Many Software  MUC-case-2,   MUC-case-4,     MUC-case-4

  a) Humans-to-Few Softwares (MUC-case-1)

  A Human / Humans who participate want to see what is going on
  between software.  Softwares are running out of control and
  sending many messages.  Software will crash itself.

  b) Humans-to-Many Softwares (MUC-case-2)

  A Human / Humans who participate want to read what is going on
  between few software.  Softwares are distributed in many locations.
  Softwares are running out of control and sending many messages.
  Server will be threaten by messages and some server will not be
  able to provide service. Human will not be able to read. If 
  the server of principal are various servers will be needed 
  to act along with other servers.

  c) Few Software-to-Few Software (MUC-case-3)

  Softwares are distributed in many locations.  Softwares are running
  out of control and sending many messages.  Softwares will crash
  itself. Maybe human will not notice this.

  d) Many Software-to-Many Software (MUC-case-4)

  Softwares are running out of control and sending many messages.
  Server will be threaten by messages and some server will not be
  able to provide service.  Softwares will crash itself.  If
  the server of principal are various servers will be needed 
  servers will  be needed to act along with other servers.
  Maybe human will not notice this.

3. Problems

  From above models, we will discuss what will happen and what will
  be a problem. This document points out what the problem is. Solutions
  are out of scope.

3.1 Message loop problem

  One major problem occurs when too many messages are sent in short
  time.  This problem when software sends human a message and the
  software has a bug which sends continuously, most likely the client
  software of human will crash.

3.1.1 Overview of the problem

  When both principals are software, there is always a risk that
  messages will be sent too many messages (like looping or bug or
  etc.)  One example is when software echoes messages of sender, it
  will reply continuously. This will leads heavy traffic and possibly
  sender will not handle this. In Human-Human model, it will not be a
  big issue because PRINCIPAL can just shutdown the client program,
  but in other cases it is not easy to do so.  In some cases, this
  problem can be solved by more care of programmers but the problem
  remains. By this mean, there should be a mechanism which does not
  allow or detect looping problem.

3.1.2 Proposed Solutions

  There are several solutions which can deal with above problem.

  a) Avoidance / Detection
  There is a possibility which can avoid looping by extending XMPP.
  One example solution  is that settling server will not allow message
  which is looping.

3.2 Receiving / Sending Many Messages from Many Clients

3.2.1 Overview of the problem

  In some cases, softwares send and receive messages which human
  will not be able to read. However when massive number of PRINCIPAL
  is connecting the XMPP server, it is like a DoS attack.
  Furthermore, when one server receives too many messages it will be 
  like a distributed denial of service (DDoS) even if the messages
  themselves are small. In this situation, there is a possibility that
  resources (CPU, Memory, bandwidth and so on) of server and 
  specific PRINCIPAL will not be  able to continue connection.

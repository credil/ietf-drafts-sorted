Abstract

   This document presents a proposal for an HTTP-based P2P streaming
   Tracker Protocol, outlining the requirements, functional entities,
   message flows, formal syntax and semantics, with detailed message
   processing instructions using an HTTP/XML encoding, the respective
   parameters, methods, and message formats. The PPSP Peer Protocol
   proposed in this document extends the capabilities of PPSP to support
   adaptive and scalable video and 3D video, for Video On Demand (VoD)
   and Live video services.

INTERNET DRAFT      HTTP-based PPSP Tracker Protocol       June 20, 2011


1  Introduction

   The P2P Streaming Protocol (PPSP) is composed of two protocols: the
   PPSP Tracker Protocol and the PPSP Peer Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-ppsp-problem-statement], [I-D.ietf-ppsp-reqs]. 

   The PPSP Peer protocol controls the advertising and exchange of media
   data directly between peers.

   The PPSP Tracker Protocol provides communication between Trackers and
   Peers, by which Peers exchange meta information with trackers, report
   streaming status and request candidate lists from trackers.

   The PPSP architecture requires PPSP peers able to communicate with a
   tracker in order to participate in a particular swarm. This
   centralized tracker service is used for peer bootstrapping and for
   content registration and location.  Content indexes (manifest files)
   are also stored in the tracker system allowing the association of
   content location information to the active peers sharing the content
   in the swarm.

   The EU research project SARACEN (Socially Aware, collaboRative,
   scAlable Coding mEdia distributioN) is developing an innovative P2P
   architecture that targets the optimization of the Quality of
   Experience in personalized media streaming, through the integration
   of scalable media coding and multi view coding techniques, and with
   respect to user privacy [refs.saracenwebpage].

   The process used for streaming distribution in SARACEN relies on a
   chunk transfer scheme whereby the original content is re-encoded
   using adaptive or scalable techniques and then chopped into small
   video chunks with a short duration:

   1. (adaptive) - alternate versions with different qualities and
      bitrates;
   2. (scalable description levels) - multiple additive descriptions
      (i.e., addition of descriptions refine the quality of the video); 
   3. (scalable layered levels) - nested dependent layers corresponding
      to several hierarchical levels of quality, i.e., higher
      enhancement layers refine the quality of the video of lower
      layers.
   4. (scalable multi views) - views correspond to 2D and to
      stereoscopic 3D videos, with several hierarchical levels of
      quality.

   These streaming distribution techniques support dynamic variations in
   video streaming quality while ensuring support for a plethora of end
   user devices and network connections.

INTERNET DRAFT      HTTP-based PPSP Tracker Protocol       June 20, 2011


   The signaling and the media transfer between PPSP peers in SARACEN is
   done using a request/reply mechanism as defined in HTTP-based PPSP
   Peer Protocol [I-D.cruz-ppsp-http-peer-protocol].

   The HTTP-based PPSP Tracker Protocol used in SARACEN and presented in
   this draft follows the design defined in PPSP Tracker protocol
   [I-D.gu-ppsp-tracker-protocol], but extending the capabilities of
   PPSP to support adaptive and scalable video.

   The goal of this draft is to derive from the work being developed in
   the SARACEN Project the implications for the standardization of the
   PPSP streaming protocols, believed as important inputs to the IETF
   PPSP working group, in order to identify open issues and promote
   further discussion. [I-D.ietf-ppsp-survey].

2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This draft uses the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ppsp-problem-statement] and in
   [I-D.gu-ppsp-tracker-protocol].

   Absolute Time: Absolute time is expressed as ISO 8601 [ISO.8601.2004]
   timestamps, using zero UTC offset (GMT).  Fractions of a second may
   be indicated. Example for December 25, 2010 at 14h56 and 20.25
   seconds: basic format 20101225T145620.25Z or extended format
   2010-12-25T14:56:20.25Z.

   Adaptive Streaming: multiple alternate versions (different qualities
   and bitrates) of the same media content co-exist for the same
   streaming session; each alternate version corresponds to a different
   media quality level; peers can choose among the alternate versions
   for decode and playback.

   Base Layer: the playable level in Scalable Video Coding (SVC)
   required by all upper level Enhancements Layers for proper decoding
   of the video.

   Chunk: A chunk is a basic unit of partitioned streaming media, which
   is used by a peer for the purpose of storage, advertisement and
   exchange among peers.

   Enhancement Layer: enhancement differential quality level in Scalable
   Video Coding (SVC) used to produce a higher quality, higher
   definition video in terms of space (i.e., image resolution), time

   (i.e., frame rate) or Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when combined with
   the playable Base Layer.

   Live streaming: The scenario where all clients receive streaming
   content for the same ongoing event.  The lags between the play points
   of the clients and that of the streaming source are small.

   Manifest: The manifest file holds information about the content,
   i.e., describes the structure of the media, namely, the codecs used,
   the chunks, and the corresponding mapping within a container file
   system.

   Peer: A peer refers to a participant in a P2P streaming system that
   not only receives streaming content, but also stores and uploads
   streaming content to other participants.

   PeerID: Unique identifier for the peer. The PeerID and any required
   security certificates are obtained from an offline enrollment server.

   Peer-Peer Messages (i.e., Peer Protocol): The Peer Protocol messages
   enable each Peer to exchange content availability with other Peers
   and request other Peers for content.

   PPSP: The abbreviation of P2P Streaming Protocols. PPSP protocols
   refer to the key signaling protocols among various P2P streaming
   system components, including the tracker and peers.

   Scalable Streaming: With Multiple Description Coding (MDC), multiple
   additive descriptions (that can be independently played-out) to
   refine the quality of the video when combined together. With Scalable
   Video Coding (SVC), nested dependent enhancement layers (hierarchical
   levels of quality), refine the quality of lower layers, from the
   lowest level (the playable Base Layer).

   Swarm: A swarm refers to a group of clients (i.e., peers) sharing the
   same content (e.g., video/audio program, digital file, etc.) at a
   given time.

   SwarmID: Unique identifier for a swarm. It is used to describe a
   specific resource shared among peers.

   Tracker: A tracker refers to a directory service which maintains the
   lists of PPSP peers storing chunks for a specific channel or
   streaming file, and answers queries from PPSP peers.

   Tracker-Peer Messages (i.e., Tracker Protocol): The Tracker Protocol
   messages provide communication between Peers and Trackers, by which
   Peers provide content availability, report streaming status and

   request candidate Peer lists from Trackers.

   UserID: Unique identifier for the peer client user. The UserID and
   any required security certificates or Tokens are obtained from an
   offline enrollment server.

   Video-on-demand (VoD): A kind of application that allows users to
   select and watch video content on demand.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The function entities involved in the PPSP Tracker Protocol are
   Trackers and Peers (which may support different capabilities).

   Peers are organized in (various) swarms corresponding each swarm to
   the group of peers sharing a content at any given time.

   The Tracker is a logical entity that maintains the lists of peers
   storing chunks for a specific channel or streaming file, answers
   queries from peers and collects information on the activity of peers.

   The tracker protocol is not used to exchange actual content data
   (either VoD or Live streaming) with peers, but information about
   which peers can provide which pieces of content.

   A P2P streaming process is summarized in Figure 1.

   When a peer wants to receive streaming of a selected content:

   1. Peer connects to a tracker and joins a swarm.
   2. Peer acquires a list of peers from the tracker.
   3. Peer exchanges its content availability with the peers on the
      obtained peer list.
   4. Peer identifies the peers with desired content.
   5. Peer requests for the content from the identified peers.

   When a peer wants to share streaming of certain content with others:

   1. Peer connects to the tracker.
   2. Peer sends information to the tracker about the swarm it belongs
      to (joins), plus streaming status and/or content availability.

                        data requests

               Figure 1: A PPSP streaming process

   The PPSP Tracker Protocol is a request-response protocol. Requests
   are sent, and responses returned to these requests. A single request
   generates a single response (neglecting fragmentation of messages).
   The specific operations of the protocol at present, are (names
   correspond to Method strings):

   1. CONNECT
   2. DISCONNECT
   3. JOIN
   4. LEAVE
   5. FIND_PEER
   6. FIND_CHUNK
   7. STAT_REPORT
   8. KEEPALIVE

   CONNECT: This method is used when a Peer connects to the system. The
   Service Tracker records the Peer-ID, connect-time (referenced to the
   absolute time), peer IP address and link status.

   DISCONNECT: This method is used when the Peer intends to leave the
   system and no longer participate in any swarm. The Service Tracker
   deletes the corresponding activity records related to the peer
   (including its status and all content status for all swarms) updating
   the information on the historical profile record of that peer.

   JOIN: This method is used for Peers to notify the Service Tracker
   that they wish to participate in a particular swarm.

   LEAVE: This method is used when Peers want to indicate to the Service
   Tracker that they no longer wish to participate in a particular
   swarm.

INTERNET DRAFT      HTTP-based PPSP Tracker Protocol       June 20, 2011


   FIND_PEER: This method allows Peers to request to the Service Tracker
   the Peer list for a specific content or a particular swarm.

   FIND_CHUNK: This method allows Peers to request to the Service
   Tracker the Peer list for a specific Chunk of a particular swarm.

   STAT_REPORT: This method allows the exchange of statistic and status
   data between Peers and Service Tracker to improve system performance.
   The method is initiated by the peer, periodically.

   KEEPALIVE: These messages are periodically sent from Peers to the
   Service Tracker to notify it that the Peer is still alive, to prevent
   the Service Tracker from disconnecting the Peer, after some pre-
   configured time (assume that the Peer is no longer available).

   The Response messages correspond to a number of logical responses
   common to the Tracker or the Peer protocols request messages.
   Incorrectly formatted XML request bodies are handled by the HTTP
   protocol itself and reported in an HTTP message.

   At present, the minimum set of response messages for the PPSP
   Streaming Protocols is the following, re-using the error codes from
   HTTP conveyed in the actual HTTP message:

   SUCCESSFUL (200 OK): a message has been processed properly and the
   desired operation has completed. If the message is a request for
   information, the body of the message will also include the requested
   information.

   INVALID SYNTAX (400 Bad Request): Indicates an error in the format of
   the message/message body. These responses correspond to errors within
   the XML/PPSP protocol messages, not HTTP.

   VERSION NOT SUPPORTED (400 Bad Request): Invalid version of the
   protocol or message bodies. These responses correspond to errors
   within the XML/PPSP protocol messages, not HTTP.

   AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED (401 UNAUTHORISED): Authentication is
   required to access this information.

   MESSAGE FORBIDDEN (403 FORBIDDEN): The requester is not allowed to
   make this request.

   OBJECT NOT FOUND (404 NOT FOUND): The requested object or a swarm
   that is being searched for cannot be found.

   INTERNAL ERROR (500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR): The server was unable to
   process the request due to an internal error.

   TEMPORARILY OVERLOADED (503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE): The server is
   unable to process this message at this time.

3.1  Assumptions

   The function entities related to PPSP protocols are the Client Media
   Player, the service Portal, the Service Tracker and Peers. Their
   complete description is not discussed in this document (as not in the
   scope of this specification).

   The Client Media Player is the entity providing a direct interface to
   the end user at the client device, and includes the functions to
   select, request, decode and render contents. In PPSP the Client Media
   Player interfaces with the peer using request and response standard
   formats for HTTP Request and Response messages [RFC2616].

   The service Portal is a logical entity typically used for client
   enrollment and content information publishing, searching and
   retrieval.

   The Service Tracker is a logical entity that maintains the lists of
   PPSP active peers storing and exchanging chunks for a specific
   content. The tracker also stores the status of peers, to help in the
   selection of appropriate candidate peers for a requesting peer.

   The Peer is also a logical entity embedding the P2P core engine, with
   a client serving side interface (a proxy HTTP server) to respond to
   Client Media Player requests and a network side interface (also an
   HTTP server) to exchange data and PPSP signaling with peers and
   trackers.

3.2  Bootstrapping

   In order to join an existing P2P streaming service and to participate
   in content sharing, any peer must first locate a Tracker service,
   using for example, the following methods (as illustrated in
   Figure 2):

   1. From a service provider provisioning mechanism: this is a typical
      case used on the provider Super-Seeders (edge caches and/or Media
      Servers).
   2. From a web page: a Publishing and Searching Portal may provide
      tracker location information to end users
   3. From the Manifest file of a content: this metainfo file must
      contain information about the address of one or more trackers
      controlling the swarm for that content.

   In order to be able to bootstrap, a peer must first obtain a PeerID

3.3  Streaming Modes

   The streaming technique is pull-based, i.e., the client peer requests
   the media chunks from serving peers and is responsible for handling
   the buffering that is necessary for the playback processes during the
   download of the media chunked files, turning this technique more
   robust to peer churn but still with acceptable latency for a smooth
   play-out.

   In Live streaming, all peers are interested in the media coming from
   an ongoing program, which means that all peers share nearly the same
   streaming content at a given point of time. Peers may store the live
   media for further distribution (known as time-shift TV), where the
   stored media is distributed in a VoD-like manner.

INTERNET DRAFT      HTTP-based PPSP Tracker Protocol       June 20, 2011


   In VoD, different peers watch different parts of the recorded media
   content during a past event. In this case, each peer keeps asking
   other peers which media chunks are stored in which peers, and then
   gets the required media from certain/selected peers.

3.5  NAT Traversal

   It is assumed that all trackers must be in the public Internet. This
   document will not describe NAT Traversal mechanisms but the proposed
   protocol tries to enable flexible NAT Traversal. Future versions will
   consider the requirements raised by NAT.

3.6  Manifest File

   The Manifest file holds information about the content, i.e.,
   describes the structure of the media, namely, the codecs used (as
   registered with the MP4 registration authority [MP4-Reg]), the
   chunks, the number of layers (in case of SVC), number of descriptions
   (in case of MDC) or views (in case of 3D) and the corresponding
   mapping within a container file system.

   The Manifest is a Well-Formed XML Document, encoded as double-byte
   Unicode.

   StreamInfo field that encapsulates all the metadata required for the
   play-out of the media in groups of <Clip> fields with  <ChunkIndex>
   elements corresponding to each component of the media (video, audio)
   streams, as well as other associated metadata (subtitles, text
   descriptions, etc.). The different <Clip> elements may include
   specific descriptor elements, like Video and Audio and respective
   attributes for each of the media types. An example of a XML manifest
   for a VoD scalable video content is the following (Figure 3):

   The Manifest file for P2P Streaming MUST contain Tracker information
   prior to its upload to the Service Tracker during the publishing
   procedure and can be compressed with GZIP file format [RFC1952] in
   order to be used with HTTP compression [RFC2616] for faster
   transmission times and less network bandwidth usage.

   The Client Media Player parses the downloaded Manifest file and, if
   it includes information for P2P Streaming, sends the file to the Peer
   via a HTTP POST and waits for the response in order to start
   requesting media chunks to decode and play-out. For applications
   where the Peer is not co-located with the Media Player in the same
   device (e.g., the Peer is in a Home Media Gateway), more than one
   Media Player MAY use the same Peer.

   The Manifest file can also be used for direct download/stream (HTTP
   Streaming) from a specific server, and in this case, the file is not
   appended with the P2P Tracker information. The Client Media Player,
   in this case, just starts requesting media chunks from the HTTP
   Streaming server to decode and play-out.

   The Manifest file for Live Streaming has a similar structure but
   describes a sliding window of a small range of <ChunkSegments> from
   the live program stream timeline (typically, 10 seconds of video).
   The sliding window is updated for every new encoded <Segment> (a
   range of chunks defined by the attributes from="##" and to="##") of
   the program stream. An example of a XML manifest for a Live scalable
   video content is the following (Figure 4):

   The naming convention used to identify the media chunks considers a
   sequential numbering for the chunks, concatenated with the identifier
   of the content, typically an alphanumeric string. For SVC and MDC
   contents, a "leveltype" and a "level_id" are added. For SVC in 3D, a
   "view" number is also added, immediately after the content
   identifier. The resulting media chunks become named as follows:

   SVC/MDC: <content_id><-><leveltype><level_id><-><chunk_id>.<ext>
   SVC/3D:
   <content_id><-><view#>-<leveltype><level_id><-><chunk_id>.<ext>

   other: <content_id><-><chunk_id>.<ext>

   Where <view#> is the character V followed by the number of views,
   <leveltype> is a character with values L for SVC Layers and D for MDC
   descriptions, <level_id> is a numeric value identifying the layer
   (SVC) or description (MDC) and <ext> follows the common media content
   extension naming.

4  Messages syntax and processing

   The PPSP Peer Protocol messages follow the request and response
   standard formats for HTTP Request and Response messages [RFC2616].

4.1  HTTP/XML Encoding

   A Request message is a standard HTTP Request generated by the HTTP
   Client Peer with the following syntax:

      <Method> /<Resource> HTTP/1.1
      Host: <Host>
      Content-Lenght: <ContentLenght>
      Content-Type: <ContentType>
      <Request_Body>

   The HTTP Method and URI path (the Resource) indicates the operation
   requested. The current proposal uses only HTTP POST as a mechanism
   for the request messages.

   The Response message is also a standard HTTP Response generated by
   the Tracker with the following syntax:

      HTTP/1.1 <StatusCode> <StatusMsg>
      Content-Lenght: <ContentLenght>
      Content-Type: <ContentType>
      Content-Encoding: <ContentCoding>
      <Response_Body>

   The Host header field in the Request message follows the standard
   rules for the HTTP 1.1 Host Header. Other Header fields MAY be
   included in the Request and Response messages if necessary.

   The body for both  Request and Response messages are encoded in XML
   for all the PPSP Peer Protocols messages, with the following schema
   (the XML information being method specific):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <ProtocolName version="#.#">
         <Method>***</Method>        <!-- for the Request method -->
         <Response>***</Response>    <!-- for the Response method -->
         <UserID>***</UserID>        <!-- on the Request method -->
         <AuthToken>***</AuthToken>  <!-- on the Request method -->
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
           ...XML information specific of the Method...
      </ProtocolName>

   In the XML body, the *** represents alphanumeric data and ###
   represents numeric data to be inserted. The <Method> corresponds to
   the method type for the message, the <Response> corresponds to the
   response method type of the message and the element <TransactionID>
   uniquely identifies the transaction.

   The Request messages MUST include identification and authentication
   token of the peer user.

   The Response message MAY use Content-Encoding entity-header with
   "gzip" compression scheme [RFC2616] for faster transmission times and
   less network bandwidth usage.

4.2  Method Fields

   Table 1 and Table 2 define the valid string representations for the
   requests and responses, respectively.  These values MUST be treated
   as case-insensitive.

4.3  Message Processing

   When a PPSP Tracker Protocol message is received, some basic
   processing is performed, regardless of the message type.

   Upon reception, a message is examined to ensure that it is properly
   formed.  The receiver MUST check that the HTTP message itself is
   properly formed, and if not, appropriate standard HTTP errors MUST be
   generated.  The receiver must also verify that the XML body is
   properly formed.  

   If the message is found to be incorrectly formed or the length does
   not match the length encoded in the header, the receiver MUST reply
   with an HTTP 400 response with a PPSP XML body with the Response
   method set to INVALID SYNTAX.

   If the version number of the protocol is for a version the receiver
   does not supports, the receiver MUST reply with an HTTP 400 response
   with a PPSP XML body with the Response method set to VERSION NOT
   SUPPORTED.

   If the receiver is unable to process the message for being in an
   overloaded state, the receiver SHOULD reply with an HTTP 503 response
   with a PPSP XML body with the Response method set to TEMPORARILY
   OVERLOADED.

INTERNET DRAFT      HTTP-based PPSP Tracker Protocol       June 20, 2011


   If the receiver encounters an internal error while attempting to
   process the message, the receiver MUST generate an HTTP 500 response
   with a PPSP XML body with the Response method set to INTERNAL ERROR.

4.4  CONNECT Message

   This method is used when a Peer connects to the system. The Service
   Tracker records the Peer-ID, connect-time, IP address and link
   status.

   The peer MUST properly form the XML body, set the Request Method to
   CONNECT, set the PeerID with the identifier of the peer, randomly
   generate and set the TransactionID and include identification
   (UserID) and authentication token (AuthToken) of the peer user. The
   peer SHOULD also include the IP addresses of its network interfaces
   in the CONNECT message. 

   The CONNECT Request message uses a HTTP POST method with the
   following body:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <PPSPTrackerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Method>CONNECT</Method>
         <PeerID>***</PeerID>
         <UserID>***</UserID>
         <AuthToken>***</AuthToken>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
         <PeerAddresses>
            <PeerAddress ip="##.##.##.##" port="###" />
            <PeerAddress ip="hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh" port="###" />
         </PeerAddresses>
      </PPSPTrackerProtocol>

   When receiving a well-formed CONNECT Request message, the Tracker
   processes the peer and user authentication information to check
   whether they are valid and that they can connect to the service.  A
   Response message with a corresponding response value and method will
   be generated.

   The element <PeerAddresses> MAY contain multiple <PeerAddress> child
   elements with attributes "ip" and "port" corresponding to each of the
   network interfaces of the peer. The "ip" attribute can be expressed
   in dotted decimal format for IPv4 or 16-bit hexadecimal values (hh)
   separated by colons (:) for IPv6.

   The Response message is a HTTP 200 OK with a SUCCESSFUL response in
   case of success. In case of error one of the response methods of
   Table 2 is returned. The response MUST have the same TransactionID
 


Cruz, et al.           Expires December 22, 2011               [Page 17]

INTERNET DRAFT      HTTP-based PPSP Tracker Protocol       June 20, 2011


   value as the request.

   An example of the SUCCESSFUL Response message structure for the
   CONNECT Request is the following:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPTrackerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Response>OK</Response>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
      </PPSPTrackerProtocol>

4.5  DISCONNECT message

   This method is used when the Peer intends to leave the system and no
   longer participate in any swarm. The Service Tracker deletes the
   corresponding activity records related to the peer (including its
   status and all content status for all swarms) updating the
   information on the historical profile record of that peer.

   In the case where the peer serves multiple clients (on the same or on
   different swarms), the DISCONNECT message SHALL NOT be used while
   there are more than one active clients. There is no need for a peer
   that sends a DISCONNECT to send a separate LEAVE to the Tracker for
   each swarm it is participating, in the case there is only one active
   client left that intends to leave the system and no longer
   participate in any swarm.

   The peer MUST properly form the XML body, set the Request Method to
   DISCONNECT, set the PeerID with the identifier of the peer, randomly
   generate and set the TransactionID and include identification
   (UserID) and authentication token (AuthToken) of the peer user.

   The DISCONNECT Request message uses a HTTP POST method with the
   following body:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPTrackerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Method>DISCONNECT</Method>
         <PeerID>***</PeerID>
         <UserID>***</UserID>
         <AuthToken>***</AuthToken>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
      </PPSPTrackerProtocol>

   The Response message is a HTTP 200 OK with a SUCCESSFUL response in
   case of success. In case of error one of the response methods of
   Table 2 is returned. The response MUST have the same TransactionID
   value as the request.

INTERNET DRAFT      HTTP-based PPSP Tracker Protocol       June 20, 2011


   Upon receiving a DISCONNECT message, the tracker MUST remove the peer
   from the peer list and from all swarms the peer joined, as if a LEAVE
   message was received for each swarm.

   An example of the SUCCESSFUL Response message structure for the
   DISCONNECT Request is the following:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPTrackerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Response>OK</Response>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
      </PPSPTrackerProtocol>

4.6  JOIN Message

   This method is used for peers to notify the Service Tracker that they
   wish to participate in a particular swarm.

   The JOIN message is used when the peer does not have any chunks or
   has some or all the chunks of a content. The JOIN is used for both
   VoD or Live streaming modes.

   The peer MUST properly form the XML body, set the Request Method to
   JOIN, set the PeerID with the identifier of the peer, set the SwarmID
   with the identifier of the swarm it is interested in, randomly
   generate and set the TransactionID and include identification
   (UserID) and authentication token (AuthToken) of the peer user. The
   peer MAY include an ExpireTime set to a non-zero value expressed in
   seconds, indicating that the peer expects to no longer be
   participating at the end of that time. The ExpireTime MUST be set to
   zero if the peer does not wish to set an expiration time.

   The JOIN Request message uses a HTTP POST method with the following
   body:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPTrackerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Method>JOIN</Method>
         <PeerID>***</PeerID>
         <UserID>***</UserID>
         <AuthToken>***</AuthToken>

         <ExpireTime>###</ExpireTime>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
      </PPSPTrackerProtocol

   When receiving a well-formed JOIN Request message, the Tracker
   processes the peer and user authentication information to check

   whether they are valid and that they can JOIN to the swarm of
   interest.  A Response message with a corresponding response value and
   method will be generated and the tracker enters the information into
   the internal peer list and swarm activity.

   The Response message is a HTTP 200 OK SUCCESSFUL message in case of a
   successful JOIN to the requested swarm. The request may be refused by
   the Tracker, depending on the peer user profile, with an HTTP 403
   Forbidden message response with a PPSP XML body of MESSAGE FORBIDDEN.
   The Tracker MUST reject the JOIN message with an HTTP 400 Bad Request
   Response with a PPSP XML body of INVALID SYNTAX for other conditions,
   with one of the response methods of Table 2.

   The response MUST have the same TransactionID value as the request.

   An example of the SUCCESSFUL Response message structure for the JOIN
   request is the following:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPTrackerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Response>OK</Response>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
      </PPSPTrackerProtocol>


4.7  LEAVE Message

   This method is used when peers want to indicate to the Service
   Tracker that they no longer wish to participate in a particular
   swarm. The Service Tracker deletes the corresponding activity records
   related to the peer, including its status and all content status for
   all swarms, updating the information on the historical profile record
   of that peer.

   The peer MUST properly form the XML body, set the Request Method to
   LEAVE, set the PeerID with the identifier of the peer, set the
   SwarmID with the identifier of the swarm the peer is not anymore
   interested, randomly generate and set the TransactionID and include
   identification (UserID) and authentication token (AuthToken) of the
   peer user.

   When receiving a well-formed LEAVE Request message, the Tracker
   processes the peer and user authentication information to check
   whether they are valid. If the request is valid, a Response message
   with a corresponding response value and method will be generated and
   the tracker deletes the corresponding activity records for that peer.

   The Response message is a HTTP 200 OK SUCCESSFUL message in case of a
   successful LEAVE to the requested swarm. The Tracker MUST reject the
   LEAVE message with an HTTP 400 Bad Request Response with a PPSP XML
   body of INVALID SYNTAX if this condition has occurred, or for other
   conditions, with one of the response methods of Table 2.

4.8  FIND_PEER Message

   This method allows peers to request to the Service Tracker the Peer
   list for a specific swarm.

   The peer MUST properly form the XML body, set the Request Method to
   FIND_PEER, set the PeerID with the identifier of the peer, set the
   SwarmID with the identifier of the swarm the peer is interested,
   optionally include information about the content, like Clip Name and
   Type, randomly generate and set the TransactionID and include
   identification (UserID) and authentication token (AuthToken) of the
   peer user.

4.11  KEEPALIVE Message

   These messages are periodically sent from peers to the Service
   Tracker to notify it that the peer is still alive (although not
   actively exchanging data with other peers), to prevent the Service
   Tracker from disconnecting the Peer (after some pre-configured time)
   assuming that the peer was no longer available).

   The peer MUST properly form the XML body, set the Request Method to
   KEEPALIVE, set the PeerID with the identifier of the peer, randomly
   generate and set the TransactionID, include identification (UserID)
   and authentication token (AuthToken) of the peer user.

   The KEEPALIVE Request message uses a HTTP POST method with the

5  Security Considerations

   Since the protocol uses HTTP to transfer signaling most of the same
   security considerations described in RFC 2616 also apply [RFC2616].

   To protect the PPSP signaling from attackers pretending to be valid
   peers (or peers other than themselves) all messages received in the
   tracker are required to be received from authorized peers and MUST be
   digitally signed with the peer user authentication token, providing
   therefore end-to-end security for communications.

   For that purpose a peer must enroll in the system via a centralized
   enrollment server. The enrollment server is expected to provide a
   proper PeerID for the peer as well as a UserID and corresponding
   authentication Token. The specification of the enrollment method and
   the provision of identifiers and authentication tokens is out of
   scope of this draft.

6  IANA Considerations

   There are presently no IANA considerations with this document.

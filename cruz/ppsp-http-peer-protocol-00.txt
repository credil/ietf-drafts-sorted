INTERNET DRAFT       HTTP-based PPSP Peer Protocol          May 31, 2011


1  Introduction

   The P2P Streaming Protocol (PPSP) is composed of two protocols: the
   PPSP Tracker Protocol and the PPSP Peer Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-ppsp-problem-statement].

   The PPSP Tracker Protocol provides communication between Trackers and
   Peers, by which Peers exchange meta information with trackers, report
   streaming status and request candidate lists from trackers. The PPSP
   Peer protocol controls the advertising and exchange of media data
   directly between peers.

   The PPSP architecture requires PPSP peers able to communicate with a
   tracker in order to participate in a particular swarm. This
   centralized tracker service is used for peer boostraping and for for
   content registration and location.  Content indexes (manifest files)
   are also stored in the tracker system allowing the association of
   content location information to the active peers sharing the content
   in the swarm.

   The signaling between PPSP Peers and trackers is done using a
   request/reply mechanism as defined in PPSP Tracker protocol
   [I-D.gu-ppsp-tracker-protocol].

   The signaling between PPSP Peers can also be done using a
   request/reply mechanism proposed in this document as PPSP Peer
   protocol.

   The process used for streaming distribution relies on a chunk
   transfer scheme whereby the original content is re-encoded using
   adaptive or scalable techniques and then chopped into small video
   chunks with a short duration:

   1. (adaptive) - alternate versions with different qualities and
      bitrates;
   2. (scalable description levels) - multiple additive descriptions
      (i.e., addition of descriptions refine the quality of the video); 
   3. (scalable layered levels) - nested dependent layers corresponding
      to several hierarchical levels of quality, i.e., higher
      enhancement layers refine the quality of the video of lower
      layers.

   These streaming distribution techniques support dynamic variations in
   video streaming quality while ensuring support for a plethora of end
   user devices and network connections.

INTERNET DRAFT       HTTP-based PPSP Peer Protocol          May 31, 2011


   The information that should be exchanged among peers using this peer
   protocol includes:

   1. peer lists, for the swarms they are participating in.
   2. chunk maps, indicating which chunks a peer possesses (for both VoD
      and Live streaming).
   3. required chunks.
   4. peer activity and status.
   5. information to help improve the performance of PPSP.

   This PPSP Peer Protocol proposal presents an early sketch for an
   extensible protocol that extends the capabilities of PPSP to support
   adaptive and scalable video, as a way to identify open issues and
   further discussion in the PPSP WG [I-D.ietf-ppsp-survey]. 

2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This draft uses the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ppsp-problem-statement] and in
   [I-D.gu-ppsp-tracker-protocol].

   Absolute Time: Absolute time is expressed as ISO 8601 [ISO.8601.2004]
   timestamps, using zero UTC offset (GMT).  Fractions of a second may
   be indicated. Example for December 25, 2010 at 14h56 and 20.25
   seconds: basic format 20101225T145620.25Z or extended format
   2010-12-25T14:56:20.25Z.

   Adaptive Streaming: multiple alternate versions (different qualities
   and bitrates) of the same media content co-exist for the same
   streaming session; each alternate version corresponds to a different
   media quality level; peers can choose among the alternate versions
   for decode and playback.

   Base Layer: the playable level in Scalable Video Coding (SVC)
   required by all upper level Enhancements Layers for proper decoding
   of the video.

   Chunk: A chunk is a basic unit of partitioned streaming media, which
   is used by a peer for the purpose of storage, advertisement and
   exchange among peers.

INTERNET DRAFT       HTTP-based PPSP Peer Protocol          May 31, 2011


   Enhancement Layer: enhancement differential quality level in Scalable
   Video Coding (SVC) used to produce a higher quality, higher
   definition video in terms of space (i.e., image resolution), time
   (i.e., frame rate) or Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when combined with
   the playable Base Layer.

   Live streaming: The scenario where all clients receive streaming
   content for the same ongoing event.  The lags between the play points
   of the clients and that of the streaming source are small.

   Manifest: The manifest file holds information about the content,
   i.e., describes the structure of the media, namely, the codecs used,
   the chunks, and the corresponding mapping within a container file
   system.

   Peer: A peer refers to a participant in a P2P streaming system that
   not only receives streaming content, but also stores and uploads
   streaming content to other participants.

   PeerID: Unique identifier for the peer. The PeerID and any required
   security certificates are obtained from an offline enrollment server.

   Peer-Peer Messages (i.e., Peer Protocol): The Peer Protocol messages
   enable each Peer to exchange content availability with other Peers
   and request other Peers for content.

   PPSP: The abbreviation of P2P Streaming Protocols. PPSP protocols
   refer to the key signaling protocols among various P2P streaming
   system components, including the tracker and peers.

   Scalable Streaming: With Multiple Description Coding (MDC), multiple
   additive descriptions (that can be independently played-out) to
   refine the quality of the video when combined together. With Scalable
   Video Coding (SVC), nested dependent enhancement layers (hierarchical
   levels of quality), refine the quality of lower layers, from the
   lowest level (the playable Base Layer).

   Swarm: A swarm refers to a group of clients (i.e., peers) sharing the
   same content (e.g., video/audio program, digital file, etc.) at a
   given time.

   SwarmID: Unique identifier for certain swarm. It is used to describe
   a specific resource shared among peers.

   Tracker: A tracker refers to a directory service which maintains the
   lists of PPSP peers storing chunks for a specific channel or
   streaming file, and answers queries from PPSP peers.

   Tracker-Peer Messages (i.e., Tracker Protocol): The Tracker Protocol
   messages provide communication between Peers and Trackers, by which
   Peers provide content availability, report streaming status and
   request candidate Peer lists from Trackers.

   Video-on-demand (VoD): A kind of application that allows users to
   select and watch video content on demand.


3.  Protocol Overview

   The function entities involved in the PPSP Peer Protocol are Peers
   which may support different capabilities.

   Peers are of two types (in terms of media sharing role):  Seeder and
   Leecher.

   The Seeder holds the complete media content (i.e., the container with
   all the corresponding chunk files).

   The Leecher is a Peer that is downloading the content and has not yet
   completed the transfer of all chunk files of the media content
   (although contributes to the swarm with the files already
   downloaded).

   Peers are organized in (various) swarms corresponding each swarm to
   the group of peers sharing a content at any given time.

   A P2P streaming process is summarized in Figure 1.

   When a peer wants to receive streaming of a selected content:

   1. Peer connects to a tracker and joins a swarm.
   2. Peer acquires a list of peers from the tracker.
   3. Peer exchanges its content availability with the peers on the
      obtained peer list.
   4. Peer identifies the peers with desired content.
   5. Peer requests for the content from the identified peers.

   When a peer wants to share streaming of certain content with others:

   1. Peer connects to the tracker.
   2. Peer sends information to the tracker about the swarm it belongs
      to (joins), plus streaming status and/or content availability.

                        data requests

               Figure 1: A PPSP streaming process

   The PPSP Peer Protocol messages allow for information to be shared
   directly between Peers. This information includes at least the
   following:

   1. peer lists, for the swarms the peers are participating in.
   2. chunk maps, indicating which chunks a peer possesses (for both VoD
      and Live streaming).
   3. required chunks.
   4. peer activity and status. 
   5. information to help improve the performance of PPSP.

   The PPSP Peer Protocol is a request-response protocol. Requests are
   sent, and responses returned to these requests. A single request
   generates a single response (neglecting fragmentation of messages).
   The specific operations of the protocol at present, are (names
   correspond to Method strings):

   1. GET_PEERLIST
   2. GET_CHUNKMAP
   3. GET_CHUNK
   4. PEER_STATUS

   GET_PEERLIST: This method allows a peer to request the Peer list for
   a specific content of a particular swarm to other Peers. The method
   is mainly used for a peer to refresh/update the list of active peers
   in the swarm.

   GET_CHUNKMAP: This method allows a peer to request which chunks of a
   content the other peer presently stores. The chunk map returned by
   the other peers lists ranges of chunks.

INTERNET DRAFT       HTTP-based PPSP Peer Protocol          May 31, 2011


   GET_CHUNK: This method allows peers to request chunks to the other
   Peers.

   PEER_STATUS: This method allows a peer to exchange information with
   other peer on its participation status. 

   The Response messages correspond to a number of logical responses
   common to the Tracker or the Peer protocols request
   messages.Incorrectly formatted XML request bodies are handled by the
   HTTP protocol itself and reported in an HTTP message.

   At present, the minimum set of response messages for the PPSP
   Streaming Protocols is the following:

   SUCCESSFUL (200 OK): a message has been processed properly and the
   desired operation has completed. If the message is a request for
   information, the body of the message will also include the requested
   information.

   INVALID SYNTAX (400 Bad Request): Indicates an error in the format of
   the message/message body. These responses correspond to errors within
   the XML/PPSP protocol messages, not HTTP.

   VERSION NOT SUPPORTED (400 Bad Request): Invalid version of the
   protocol or message bodies. These responses correspond to errors
   within the XML/PPSP protocol messages, not HTTP.

   AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED (401 UNAUTHORISED): Authentication is
   required to access this information.

   MESSAGE FORBIDDEN (403 FORBIDDEN): The requester is not allowed to
   make this request.

   OBJECT NOT FOUND (404 NOT FOUND): The requested object or a swarm
   that is being searched for cannot be found.

   INTERNAL ERROR (500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR): The server was unable to
   process the request due to an internal error.

   TEMPORARILY OVERLOADED (503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE): The server is
   unable to process this message at this time.

3.1  Assumptions

   The function entities related to PPSP protocols are the Client Media
   Player, the service Portal, the Tracker and Peers. Their complete
   description is not discussed in this document (as not in the scope of
   this specification).

INTERNET DRAFT       HTTP-based PPSP Peer Protocol          May 31, 2011


   The Client Media Player is the entity providing a direct interface to
   the end user at the client device, and includes the functions to
   select, request, decode and render contents. In PPSP the Client Media
   Player interfaces with the peer using request and response standard
   formats for HTTP Request and Response messages [RFC2616].

   The service Portal is a logical entity typically used for client
   enrollment and content information publishing, searching and
   retrieval.

   The Tracker is a logical entity that maintains the lists of PPSP
   active peers storing and exchanging chunks for a specific content.
   The tracker also stores the status of peers, to help in the selection
   of appropriate candidate peers for a requesting peer.

   The Peer is also a logical entity embedding the P2P core engine, with
   a client serving side interface (a proxy HTTP server) to respond to
   Client Media Player requests and a network side interface (also an
   HTTP server) to exchange data and PPSP signaling with peers and
   trackers.

3.2  Bootstrapping

   In order to join an existing P2P streaming service and to participate
   in content sharing, any peer must first locate a Tracker service,
   using for example, the following methods (as illustrated in
   Figure 2):

   1. From a service provider provisioning mechanism: this is a typical
      case used on the provider Super-Seeders (edge caches and/or Media
      Servers).
   2. From a web page: a Publishing and Searching Portal may provide
      tracker location information to end users
   3. From the Manifest file of a content: this metainfo file must
      contain information about the address of one or more trackers
      controlling the swarm for that content.

   In order to be able to bootstrap, a peer must first obtain a PeerID
   and any required security certificates from an enrollment service
   (user registration).

3.3  Streaming Modes

   The streaming technique is pull-based, i.e., the client peer requests
   the media chunks from serving peers and is responsible for handling
   the buffering that is necessary for the playback processes during the
   download of the media chunked files, turning this technique more
   robust to peer churn but still with acceptable latency for a smooth
   play-out.

   In Live streaming, all peers are interested in the media coming from
   an ongoing program, which means that all peers share nearly the same
   streaming content at a given point of time. Peers may store the live
   media for further distribution (known as time-shift TV), where the
   stored media is distributed in a VoD-like manner.

   In VoD, different peers watch different parts of the recorded media
   content during a past event. In this case, each peer keeps asking

   other peers which media chunks are stored in which peers, and then
   gets the required media from certain/selected peers.

3.4  Chunk Scheduling

   The goal of chunk trading is receiving the stream smoothly (and with
   small delay) and to cooperate in the distribution procedure. Peers
   need to exchange information about their current status to enable
   scheduling decisions.  The information exchanged refers to the state
   of the peer with respect to the flow, i.e., a map of which chunks are
   needed by a peer to smoothly play-out the stream.

   This task means:

   1. sending chunk maps to other nodes with the proper timing,
   2. receiving chunk maps from other nodes and merging the information
      in the local buffer map.
   3. besides chunk map exchange, the signaling includes
      Status/Request/Select primitives used to trade chunks.

   The core of the scheduler, not described in this specification, is
   the algorithm used to choose the chunks to be exchanged and the peers
   to communicate with.

3.5  NAT Traversal

   It is assumed that all trackers must be in the public Internet. This
   document will not describe NAT Traversal mechanisms but the proposed
   protocol tries to enable flexible NAT Traversal. Future versions will
   consider the requirements raised by NAT.

3.6  Manifest File

   The Manifest file holds information about the content, i.e.,
   describes the structure of the media, namely, the codecs used, the
   chunks, the number of layers (in case of SVC) or number of
   descriptions (in case of MDC), and the corresponding mapping within a
   container file system.

   The Manifest is a Well-Formed XML Document, encoded as double-byte
   Unicode.

   The Manifest is a composite schema that includes, as root Element, a
   StreamInfo field that encapsulates all the metadata required for the
   play-out of the media in groups of <Clip> fields with  <ChunkIndex>
   elements corresponding to each component of the media (video, audio)
   streams, as well as other associated metadata (subtitles, text
   descriptions, etc.). The different <Clip> elements may include

   specific descriptor elements, like Video and Audio and respective
   attributes for each of the media types. An example of a XML manifest
   for a VoD scalable video content is the following (Figure 3):


      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <StreamInfo>
         <Trackers>
            <Tracker url="http://maintracker:80" tier="1" />
            <Tracker url="http://othertracker:80" tier="2" />
         </Trackers>

               <VideoQuality width="720" height="1280" level="0" />
               <VideoQuality width="1920" height="1080" level="3" />

            <ChunkSegments type="video">
               <Segment chunks="150" levels="8" />
            </ChunkSegments>
         </Clip>
      </StreamInfo>

             Figure 3: XML Manifest for a VoD scalable video

   The Manifest file for P2P Streaming MUST contain Tracker information
   prior to its upload to the Service Tracker during the publishing
   procedure and can be compressed with GZIP file format [RFC 1952] in
   order to be used with HTTP compression [RFC 2616] for faster
   transmission times and less network bandwidth usage.

   The Client Media Player parses the downloaded Manifest file and, if
   it includes information for P2P Streaming, sends the file to the Peer
   via a HTTP POST and waits for the response in order to start
   requesting media chunks to decode and play-out.

   The Manifest file can also be used for direct download/stream (HTTP
   Streaming) from a specific server, and in this case, the file is not
   appended with the P2P Tracker information. The Client Media Player,
   in this case, just starts requesting media chunks from the HTTP
   Streaming server to decode and play-out.

   The Manifest file for Live Streaming has a similar structure but
   describes a sliding window of a small range of <ChunkSegments> from
   the live program stream timeline (typically, 10 seconds of video).
   The sliding window is updated for every new encoded segment of the

   The naming convention used to identify the media chunks considers a
   sequencial numbering for the chunks, concatenated with the identifier
   of the content, tipically an alphanumeric string. For SVC and MDC
   contents, a "leveltype" and a "level_id" are added, being the media
   chunks named as follows:

   SVC/MDC:
   <content_id><-><leveltype><level_id><-><chunk_id>.<extension>

   other: <content_id><-><chunk_id>.<extension>

   Where <leveltype> is a character with values L for SVC Layers and D
   for MDC descriptions, and <Level_id> is a numeric value identifying
   the layer (SVC) or description (MDC).

   Video MPEG: A123456789-00000.mp4

4  Messages syntax and processing

   The PPSP Peer Protocol messages follow the request and response
   standard formats for HTTP Request and Response messages [RFC2616].

4.1  HTTP/XML Encoding

   A Request message is a standard HTTP Request generated by the HTTP
   Client Peer with the following syntax:

      <Method> /<Resource> HTTP/1.1
      Host: <Host>

   The HTTP Method and URI path (the Resource) indicates the operation
   requested. The current proposal uses only HTTP POST as a mechanism
   for the request messages.

   The Host header follows the standard rules for the HTTP 1.1 Host
   Header.

   The Response message is also a standard HTTP Response generated by
   the HTTP Serving Peer with the following syntax:

      HTTP/1.1 <StatusCode> <StatusMsg>
      Content-Lenght: <ContentLenght>
      Content-Type: <ContentType>
      Content-Encoding: <ContentCoding>
      <Response_Body>

INTERNET DRAFT       HTTP-based PPSP Peer Protocol          May 31, 2011


   The body for both  Request and Response messages are encoded in XML
   for all the PPSP Peer Protocols messages, with the following schema
   (the XML information being method specific):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <ProtocolName version="#.#">
         <Method>***</Method>     <!-- for the Request method -->
         <Response>***</Response> <!-- for the Response method -->
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
           ...XML information specific of the Method...
      </ProtocolName>

   In the XML body, the *** represents alphanumeric data and ###
   represents numeric data to be inserted. The <Method> corresponds to
   the method type for the message, the <Response> corresponds to the
   response method type of the message and the element <TransactionID>
   uniquely identifies the transaction.

   The Response message MAY use Content-Encoding entity-header with
   "gzip" compression scheme [RFC2616] for faster transmission times and
   less network bandwidth usage.

4.2  Method Fields

   Table 1 and Table 2 define the valid string representations for the
   requests and responses, respectively.  These values MUST be treated
   as case-insensitive.

4.3  Message Processing

   When a PPSP Peer Protocol message is received in a peer, some basic
   processing is performed, regardless of the message type.

   Upon reception, a message is examined to ensure that it is properly
   formed.  The receiver MUST check that the HTTP message itself is
   properly formed, and if not appropriate standard HTTP errors MUST be
   generated.  The receiver must also verify that the XML body is
   properly formed.  If the message is found to be incorrectly formed or
   the length does not match the length encoded in the header, the
   receiver MUST reply with an HTTP 400 response with a PPSP XML body
   with the Response method set to INVALID SYNTAX.

4.4  GET_PEERLIST Message

   The GET_PEERLIST message is sent from a client peer to a selected
   serving peer in order for a peer to refresh/update the list of active
   peers in the swarm.

   The Request message uses a HTTP POST method with the following body:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPPeerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Method>GET_PEERLIST</Method>
         <PeerID>***</PeerID>
         <SwarmID>***</SwarmID>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
      </PPSPPeerProtocol>

   The sender MUST properly form the XML body, MUST set the Method
   string to GET_PEERLIST, MUST set the PeerID to the PeerID of the
   peer, MUST set the SwarmID to the joined swarm identifier and
   randomly generate and set the TransactionID value.

   When receiving the GET_PEERLIST message, and if the message is well
   formed and accepted, the peer will search for the requested data and
   will respond to the requesting peer with an HTTP 200 OK message
   response with a PPSP XML payload SUCCESSFUL, as well as the peer list
   with PeerIDs (and respective IP Addresses) of peers that can provide
   the specific content.

   The response MUST have the same TransactionID value as the request.

   An example of the Response message structure is the following:

   The element <PeerInfoList> MAY contain multiple <PeerInfo> child
   elements.

   The element <PeerAddresses> MAY contain multiple <PeerAddress> child
   elements with attributes "ip" and "port" corresponding to each of the
   network interfaces of the peer. The "ip" attribute can be expressed
   in dotted decimal format for IPv4 or 16-bit hexadecimal values (hh)
   separated by colons (:) for IPv6.

   The elements <PeerLocation> and <ConnectionType> have a string
   format, and together with the element <EndPointRankCost> of numerical
   integer format, form a set of information related to peer location.

4.5  GET_CHUNKMAP Message

   The GET_CHUNKMAP message is sent from a client peer to a selected
   serving peer in order to receive the map of chunks of a content (of a
   swarm identified by SwarmID) the other peer presently stores. The
   chunk map returned by the other peer lists ranges of chunks. The
   Request message uses a HTTP POST method with the following body:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPPeerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Method>GET_CHUNKMAP</Method>
         <PeerID>***</PeerID>
         <SwarmID>***</SwarmID>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
      </PPSPPeerProtocol>

   The sender MUST properly form the XML body, MUST set the Method
   string to GET_CHUNKMAP, MUST set the PeerID to the PeerID of the
   peer, MUST set the SwarmID to the joined swarm identifier and
   randomly generate and set the TransactionID value.

   When receiving the GET_CHUNKMAP message, and if the message is well
   formed and accepted, the peer will search for the requested data and
   will respond to the requesting peer with an HTTP 200 OK message
   response with a PPSP XML payload SUCCESSFUL, as well as the map of
   chunks it currently stores of the specific content.

   The response MUST have the same TransactionID value as the request.

   The Response message is an HTTP 200 OK message with the following
   body, exemplified for a video component of a media clip:

                                bitmapSize="###">

         </StreamInfo>
      </PPSPPeerProtocol>

   The element <StreamInfo> MAY contain multiple <Clip> child elements.

   The element <ChunkSegments> has an attribute "type" that indicates
   the type of media of the corresponding chunks. 

   A <ChunkSegments> element MAY contain multiple <ChunkSegment> child
   elements with attributes "from" and "to" corresponding to ranges of
   contiguous chunks. The "from", "to", and "bitmapSize" attributes are
   expressed as integer number string format. The <ChunkSegment> content
   corresponds to the chunk map, and is represented as base64 encoded
   string.

4.6  GET_CHUNK Message

   The GET_CHUNK message is sent from a client peer to a serving peer in
   order to request the delivery of media content chunks. The Request
   message uses a HTTP POST method with the following body:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPPeerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Method>GET_CHUNK</Method>
         <PeerID>***</PeerID>
         <SwarmID>***</SwarmID>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
      </PPSPPeerProtocol>

   The sender MUST properly for the HTTP request for a POST method
   including the URI path (the Resource) of the chunk. The sender MUST
   also properly form the XML body, MUST set the Method string to
   GET_CHUNK, MUST set the PeerID to the PeerID of the peer, MUST set

       Figure 5: Example of GET_CHUNK message sequence (simplified)

   When receiving the GET_CHUNK message, and if the message is well
   formed and accepted, the peer will search for the requested data and
   will respond to the requesting peer with an HTTP 200 OK message
   response with a PPSP XML payload SUCCESSFUL, as well as the map of
   chunks it currently stores of the specific content.

   The Response message is an HTTP 200 OK message with the body,
   immediately followed by the chunk data transfer, as shown in
   Figure 5.

   The response MUST have the same TransactionID as the request.

4.7  PEER_STATUS Message

   The PEER_STATUS message is sent from a serving peer to a client peer
   to indicate its participation status. The information conveyed may
   include information related to chunk trading like "choke" (to inform
   the other peer of the intention to stop sending data to it) and
   "unchoke" (to inform the other peer of the intention to start/re-
   start sending data to it).

   The Request message uses a HTTP POST method with the following body:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPPeerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Method>PEER_STATUS</Method>
         <PeerID>***</PeerID>
         <SwarmID>***</SwarmID>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
         <Status>(choke/unchoke)</Status>
      </PPSPPeerProtocol>

   The sender MUST properly form the XML body, MUST set the Method
   string to PEER_STATUS, MUST set the PeerID to the PeerID of the peer,
   MUST set the SwarmID to the joined swarm identifier and randomly
   generate and set the TransactionID value.

   When receiving the PEER_STATUS message, and if the message is well
   formed and accepted, the peer will respond to the requesting peer
   with an HTTP 200 OK message response with a PPSP XML payload
   SUCCESSFUL.

   If the status signal received is "choke" the peer will stop
   requesting chunks from the other peer until receiving an "unchoke"
   status signal.

   The only element currently defined in the request message is
   <Status>, assuming values of "choke" and "unchoke", but, in future,
   other values may be added.

   The Response message is an HTTP 200 OK message with the following
   body.

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <PPSPPeerProtocol version="#.#">
         <Response>OK</Response>
         <TransactionID>###</TransactionID>
      </PPSPPeerProtocol>

   The response MUST have the same TransactionID value as the request.

   The only element currently defined in the response message is the
   <TransactionID>, but, in future, other elements may be added, for
   example, containing statistical data or other primitives for chunk
   trading negotiation.

5  Security Considerations

   The security considerations will depend on the design of the PPSP
   peer protocol. Security will be considered in further version of this
   draft.

6  IANA Considerations

   There are presently no IANA considerations with this document.

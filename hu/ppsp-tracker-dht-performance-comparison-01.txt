Internet-Draft  Tracker vs. DHT Performance Comparison      October 2009


1. Introduction

   Assume there are D resources shared by N peers in a P2P streaming system,
   there are different kinds of methods for a given peer to locate or
   discover a specific resource [PPSP]. One is tracker-based method, where
   a peer reports the resource(s) it has to a centralized server (i.e. the
   tracker). When the tracker receives a resource request from a peer,
   it returns to the requesting peer with a list of peers which have the
   requested resource. Another method is a DHT-based (such as [Chord]),
   fully-distributed lookup protocol, where resource information is
   stored by all the peers in the P2P network. We estimate the
   performance of the two methods.

   For P2P streaming usage scenarios, N is the number of active users in
   a P2P streaming software (such as PPLive, PPStream), D is the number
   of channels (for live streaming) or videos (for VoD) the software
   provides. For a popular P2P streaming software, there are about 10 million
   active users and about 100 thousand resources.

2. Resource discovery

   P2P streaming is usually divided into chunks. A chunk is a basic unit
   of partitioned streaming, which is used for the purpose of storage
   and advertising to neighbors what parts of a movie a peer holds
   [Sigcomm:P2P streaming]. In this part of comparison, we only consider
   the discovery of the coarse information (resource information), and
   compare the discovery of the grain information (chunk information) in
   the next part.

   In other words, we compare the following two methods. In tracker-
   based method, the tracker stores the resource information (given a
   resource Ri, the list of peers [Pi] that have Ri), while the chunk
   information (Pi has which chunks) is exchanged using peer gossip.
   Similarly, in DHT-based method, only resource information is obtained
   using DHT method, and chunk information is also exchanged using peer
   gossip after the requesting peer gets the peer list that has the
   requested resource. One assumption in DHT-based method is that all the
   nodes are geographically distributed on the whole Internet.

2.1. Lookup efficiency

   In the estimation, we assume average RTT in the network is 200ms, 
   N = 10,000,000 and D = 100,000.

   In tracker-based method, assume one tracker is used, resource
   information is stored using dictionary: {Ri: [Pi]}, then:

   (a) Lookup message: O(1)

   (b) Lookup operations: O(1)

   Lookup operation is to find one record in N records in the tracker.

   (c) Lookup latency: O(1)*RTT = 200ms

   The delay caused by lookup operations is negligible compared with
   the network delay.

   In DHT-based method:

   (a) Lookup message: O(log(N)) = 23

   (b) Lookup operations: log(N)*O(1) = 23

   Each node maintains information about O(log(N)) other nodes. Lookup
   operation is done by routing through O(log(N)) other nodes toward the
   destination. In each node, lookup operation is to find one record in
   O(log(N)) records.

   (c) Lookup latency: O(log(N))*RTT = 23*200ms = 4.6s

   The delay caused by lookup operations is negligible compared with
   the network delay.

   Summary: Tracker-based method is much faster than DHT-based method.
   The 4.6s lookup latency is relatively high in P2P streaming
   applications.

2.2. Network traffic

   Assume on average each peer requests new channels or videos every T
   seconds, then totally there are N/T requests per second in the
   network. Assume on average the size of a message is S Bytes.

   In the following estimation, we assume T = 60 sec. The size of the
   response message is usually larger than the request message. For
   simplicity, we assume S = 1K Bytes.

   In tracker-based method:
   (a) Number of messages per second: N/T*2 = 10,000,000/60*2 = 3.3*100,000

Internet-Draft  Tracker vs. DHT Performance Comparison      October 2009


   There are N/T channel/video requests per second in the network, and
   each request takes 2 messages (one request and one response)

   (b) Size of messages per second: N/T*2*S = 3.3*100,000*1K = 3.3 *100,000,000 
    = 0.33GBytes

   (c) Number of messages in node join/leave: O(1)

   In DHT-based method:
   (a) Number of messages per second: N/T*2*log(N) = 10,000,000/60*2*23 
    = 7.7*1,000,000

   There are N/T channel/video requests per second in the network, and
   each request takes 2*log(N) messages.

   (b) Size of messages per second: N/T*2*log(N) *S = 7.7*1,000,000*1K = 
   7.7*1,000,000,000 = 7.7GBytes

   (c) Number of messages in node join/leave: O((logN)*(logN)) = 541

   Summary: Tracker-based method has much smaller network traffic
   overhead than DHT-based method, but both methods are acceptable in
   P2P streaming applications.

2.3. Host requirement

   In tracker-based method:

   (a) Memory requirement:

   Information of D resources is stored in the tracker. If on average
   one peer has C resources (the user watches the video or stores the
   video for other peers), then the average length of the peer list for
   each resource is N*C/D. Assume each peer is represented by P Bytes,
   then the total size of this table is D* (N*C/D)*P = N*C*P Bytes.

   Assume C = 10, P = 20 Bytes, then memory requirement is N*C*P =
   10,000,000*10*20 = 2GBytes
   
   (b) Number of received requests per second: N/T = 10,000,000/60 
    = 1.67*100,000

   Assume on average each peer requests new channels or videos every T
   seconds, then totally there are N/T requests per second to the
   tracker.

   (c) Size of request/response messages per second: N/T*2*S =3.33*100,000*1K
    = 0.33GBytes

   S is the average size of request/response message, and we assume S =
   1K Bytes.

   In DHT-based method:

   (a) Memory requirement:

   Information of D resources is stored in N peers, so on average each 
   peer stores information for D/N = 100,000/10,000,000 = 0.01 resource.

   For those peers that store resource information, the average length
   of the peer list for each resource is N*C/D. Assume each peer is
   represented by P=20 Bytes, then the memory requirement is (N*C/D)*P =
   10,000,000*10/100,000*20 Bytes = 20KBytes.

   In addition, each node maintains information about O(log(N)) other
   nodes, assume the size of the neighbor information is E Bytes, this
   part of memory requirement is O(log(N))*E Bytes = 23*10 = 230 Bytes
   (assume E = 10 Bytes).

   (b) Number of received requests per second:

   There are N/T channel/video requests per second in the network, and
   each request takes log(N) request messages. So on average the number
   of requests one peer receives per second is: N/T*log(N)/N = log(N)/T
   = 23/60 = 0.4

   (c) Size of request/response messages per second: 2*log(N)/T*S =
   2*0.4*1K = 0.8 KBytes

   S is the average size of request/response message, and assume S = 1K
   Bytes.

   Summary: DHT-based method has much less host resources requirement
   than tracker-based method. For robustness and performance
   considerations, multiple trackers can be used.

3. Chunk discovery

   In this part, we compare the following two methods. In tracker-based
   method, the tracker stores the resource information, and the chunk
   information is exchanged using peer gossip. While in DHT-based method,
   both resource information and chunk information are obtained using

   DHT method. For the DHT-based method, we use the first solution in
   [PPSPChunk]. For the tracker-based method, since the tracker only
   stores the resource information, the performance analysis is the same
   as the previous part. In this part, we also add the performance
   analysis for the peer gossip. We assume each peer gossips with M
   neighbors.

3.1. Lookup efficiency

   In the following estimation, we assume average RTT in the network is 
   200ms, N = 10,000,000, D = 100,000 and M = 20.

   Tracker side:

   (a) Lookup message: O(1)

   (b) Lookup operations: O(1)

   (c) Lookup latency: O(1)*RTT = 200ms

   Peer side:

   (a) Lookup message: M*O(1) = 20

       Each peer send a lookup message to M neighbors.

   (b) Lookup operations: O(1)

   (c) Lookup latency: O(1)*RTT = 200ms

   In DHT-based method:

   (a) Lookup message: O(log(N)) = 23

   (b) Lookup operations: log(N)*O(1) = 23

   (c) Lookup latency: O(log(N))*RTT = 23*200ms = 4.6s

   Summary: Tracker-based method is much faster than DHT-based method.
   The 4.6s lookup latency is relatively high in P2P streaming
   applications.

3.2. Network traffic

   In tracker-based method:

   Tracker side:
   (a) Number of messages per second: N/T*2 = 10,000,000/60*2 = 3.3*100,000
   
   (b) Size of messages per second: N/T*2*S = 3.3*100,000*1K = 3.3 *100,000,000
   =0.33GBytes

   (c) Number of messages in node join/leave: O(1)

   Peer side:

   Assume each peer sends gossip message every I seconds, I = 10 sec.
   (a) Number of messages per second: M*N/I*2 = 20*10,000,000/10*2 
    = 4*10,000,000
   
   (b) Size of messages per second: M*N/I*2*S = 4*10,000,000*1K = 40GBytes

   In DHT-based method:

   Assume the rate of the video is R KBytes/sec, the size of the chunk
   is Z Kbytes, then the number of chunk requested per second is R/Z.
   Assume R = 32 Kbytes/sec, Z = 16 Kbytes, then R/Z = 2.

   (a) Number of messages per second: N*(R/Z)*2log(N) = 10,000,000*2*2*23
   = 1,000,000,000
   There are N*(R/Z) chunk requests per second in the network, and each
   request takes 2*log(N) messages.

   (b) Size of messages per second: N*(R/Z)*2log(N)*S = 1,000,000,000*1K 
    = 1TBytes

   (c) Number of messages in node join/leave: O((logN)*(logN)) = 541

   Summary: Tracker-based method has much smaller network traffic
   overhead than DHT-based method, but both methods are acceptable in
   P2P streaming applications.
3.3. Host requirement

   In tracker-based method:

   Tracker side:
   (a) Memory requirement: N*C*P = 10,000,000*10*20 = 2GBytes

   (b) Number of received requests per second: N/T = 10,000,000/60 =
    1.7*100,000

   (c) Size of request/response messages per second: N/T*2*S =
   3.3*100,000*1K = 0.33GBytes

   Peer side:

   Assume the size of the bitmap is Bm Bytes, Bm = 1K.

   (a) Memory requirement: M*Bm = 20*1K = 20KBytes

   (b) Number of received requests per second: M/I = 20/10 = 2

   (c) Size of request/response messages per second: M/I*2*S = 2*2*1K =
   4KBytes

   In DHT-based method:

   (a) Memory requirement:
   Assume the number of chunks in one resource is H, H = 10000. D*H chunk
   information is stored in N peers, so on average each peer stores 
   information for D*H/N = 100,000*10,000/10,000,000 = 100 chunks.

   The average length of the peer list for each chunk is N*C/D. Assume
   each peer is represented by P Bytes, then the memory requirement is
   (N*C/D)*P*(100 chunks) = 20KBytes*(100 chunks) = 2MBytes.

   In addition, each node maintains information about O(log(N)) other
   nodes, this part of memory requirement is O(log(N))*E Bytes = 23*10 =
   230 Bytes (assume E = 10 Bytes).

   (b) Number of received requests per second:

   There are N*(R/Z)=2N chunk requests per second in the network, and each
   request takes log(N) request messages. So on average the number of
   requests one peer receives per second is: 2*log(N) = 2*23 = 46

   (c) Size of request/response messages per second: 2*log(N)*2*S = 46*2*1K
   = 92 KBytes

   S is the average size of request/response message, and assume S =
   1K Bytes.

   Summary: DHT-based method has much less host resources requirement
   than tracker-based method. For robustness and performance
   considerations, multiple trackers can be used.

4. Conclusion

   Centralized tracker solution for resource discovery (and chunk lookup)
   has much shorter response time than highly distributed DHT approach.
   In a large network, the DHT approach's response time can be very long
   (on the order of seconds), which is not suitable for delay sensitive
   applications. On the other hand, the per-host requirement of the
   tracker is higher than that of DHT nodes, but is still within reach
   of a $1000 commodity PC. Because the lookup messages have business
   value and should be stored for latter analysis, using a small number
   of trackers will make the job much easier than a highly distributed
   approach.

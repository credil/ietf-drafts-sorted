   Extending the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for TRILL campus
                       draft-hu-vrrp-trill-00.txt

Abstract

   TRILL can be implemented in data center, which is request high
   reliability and stable, but if RBridge breaks down, the switch time
   is up to IS-IS topology convergence time.  This is not satisfied to
   the data center service.  VRRP provides a redundancy mechanism to
   avoid single point of failure and fast switching over.  This draft
   proposes to extend VRRP protocol to TRILL in data center.

Internet-Draft               VRRP For TRILL                     Feb 2011


1.  Introduction

   TRILL (transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) is a new
   technology merging the advantages of layer two and layer three
   technology[RFCtrill], and is designed to replace STP(Spanning Tree
   Protocol).  The routing protocol IS-IS is used as control plane
   protocol to discover the topology and advertise link state.  When the
   topology changes, IS-IS LSPs flood the link state to other adjacency.
   The topology convergence time is about dozens of seconds.

   As TRILL deploys in many data centers, it's necessary to interconnect
   the different data centers.  The interconnection scenario is as
   figure 1.  BRB (Border RBridge) is the border of data center, and all
   the data cross data center will get through BRB.  If BRB is down, the
   cross data center communication will get down.  BRB becomes the
   bottleneck of data center and is very easy to create a single point
   of failure.  The solution is to provide redundant equipment to backup
   BRB.  If BRB is broken down, the backup BRB can replace it.  But the
   switching time is dependent the topology convergence time.However,it
   is request very high reliability in data center for providing video
   data application.

   This draft propose to apply VRRP for ensure switching speed.  The
   VRRP mechanism can implement the millisecond switching time to ensure
   video data [VRRPv3].  The BRB and backup BRB are configured as a VRRP
   group with the same virtual system ID and virtual nickname.  The
   master BRB of the group floods the virtual nickname to adjacency.If
   the Master becomes unavailable then the highest priority Backup will
   be elected as Master after a short delay, providing a controlled
   transition of the virtual RBridge responsibility with minimal service
   interruption, and the master elected floods LSPs and data forwarding
   in TRILL campus, and the content of LSPs and the IS-IS link state
   topology doesn't change.

Internet-Draft               VRRP For TRILL                     Feb 2011


2.  Terminology

   Border RBridge: Abbr.  BRB, a device locates the border of TRILL
   campus and runs TRILL protocol, BRB is used to communicate with other
   TRILL campus

   VRRP RBridge: an RBridge running the Virtual Router Redundancy
   Protocol.  It may participate in one or more VRRP groups.

   Virtual RBridge: An abstract object managed by VRRP that acts as a
   default RBridge for devices on a shared LAN.  It consists of a
   Virtual System Identifier and a set of associated nickname (s) across
   a common LAN.  A VRRP RBridge may backup one or more virtual
   RBridges.

   Nickname OwnerGBPoThe VRRP RBridge that has the virtual RBridge's
   nickname as one of its nickname addresses.  This is the RBridge that,
   when up, will respond to packets addressed to one of these nickname
   addresses for ICMP pings, TCP connections, etc.

   Virtual RBridge masterGBPoThe VRRP RBridge that is assuming the
   responsibility of forwarding packets sent to the nickname associated
   with the virtual RBridge, and answering ARP requests for these
   nickname.  Note that if the nickname owner is available, then it will
   always become the Master.

   Virtual RBridge backupGBPoThe set of VRRP RBridge available to assume
   forwarding responsibility for a virtual RBridge should the current
   Master fail.


3.  Application Scenario

   The following figure shows a typical network with two VRRP BRBs
   implementing one virtual RBridge.  One BRB is the virtual RBridge
   master, and the other BRB is virtual RBridge backup.  BRB1 is
   assigned nickname owner of nickname A, and RBR2 is assigned nickname
   owner of nickname B. A virtual RBridge is then defined by associating
   a virtual nickname, which can be one of the nicknames of RBR1 and
   RBR2, or a different nickname from nickname A and nickname B. if
   virtual nickname is the nickname RB1, RBR1 is the nickname owner,
   then RBR1 is the virtual RBridge master automatically.  Otherwise,
   the virtual RBridge master will be elected from RB1 and RB2 according
   to the priority.  VRRP protocol manages virtual RBridge fail over to
   a backup RBridge.  The master RBridge floods the IS-IS LSPs and data
   forwarding according to virtual system id and nickname(s) in TRILL
   campus.

4.  TRILL VRRP Frames

   By multicasting periodically a TRILL VRRP frame, a master RBridge
   announces its existence and functionality to the backup RBridge(s) in
   a VRRP group.  If none TRILL VRRP frame is received in a certain
   time, backup RBridge(s) will consider the master unavailable and
   trigger a new master RBridge election process.

   A TRILL VRRP frame on an 802.3 link is structured as figure 3.  All
   such frames are Ethertype encoded.  The RBridge port out which such a
   frame is sent will strip the outer VLAN tag if configured to do so.

4.4.  Frame Check Sequence (FCS)

   Each Ethernet frame has a single Frame Check Sequence (FCS) that is
   computed to cover the entire frame, for detecting frame corruption
   due to bit errors on a link.  Thus, when a frame is encapsulated, the
   original FCS is not included but is discarded.  Any received frame
   for which the FCS check fails SHOULD be discarded (this may not be
   possible in the case of cut through forwarding).

   Although the FCS is normally calculated just before transmission, it
   is desirable, when practical, for an FCS to accompany a frame within
   an RBridge after receipt.

5.1.  Version

   The version field specifies the TRILL VRRP protocol version of this
   packet.  This document defines version 1.

Internet-Draft               VRRP For TRILL                     Feb 2011


5.2.  Type

   The type field specifies the type of this TRILL VRRP packet.  The
   only packet type defined in this version of the protocol is:

   1 ADVERTISEMENT

   A packet with unknown type MUST be discarded.

5.3.  Virtual RB ID

   The Virtual RBridge Identifier (VRBID) field identifies the virtual
   RBridge this packet is reporting status for.  It is a configurable
   item in the range 1-255 (decimal).  There is no default.

5.4.   Priority

   The priority field specifies the sending TRILL VRRP RBridge's
   priority for the virtual RBridge.  Higher values equal higher
   priority.  This field is an 8-bit unsigned integer field.

   The priority value for the TRILL VRRP RBridge that owns the nicknames
   associated with the virtual nickname MUST be 255 (decimal).

   TRILL VRRP RBridges backing up a virtual RBridge MUST use priority
   values between 1-254 (decimal) and the default priority value is
   100(decimal).

   The priority value zero (0) has special meaning, indicating that the
   current Master has stopped participating in TRILL VRRP.  This is used
   to trigger backup RBridges to quickly transition to Master without
   having to wait for the current Master to time out.

5.5.   Count Nicknames

   The number of nicknames contained in this TRILL VRRP advertisement.

5.6.   Rsvd

   This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on
   reception.

5.7.   Maximum Advertisement Interval (Max Adver Int)

   The Maximum Advertisement Interval is a 12-bit field that indicates
   the time interval (in centiseconds) between ADVERTISEMENTS.  The
   default is 100 centiseconds (1 second).

5.8.   Checksum

   The checksum field is used to detect data corruption in the TRILL
   VRRP message.

   The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement
   sum of the entire TRILL VRRP message starting with the version field.
   For computing the checksum, the checksum field is set to zero.  See
   RFC1071 for more detail [CKSM].

5.9.   Virtual System ID

   The virtual system id is a 48-bit field that indicates the system id
   of the virtual RBridge this packet is reporting status for.

   All the RBridges in a virtual RBridge MUST be configured with the
   same virtual system id.  When a TRILL VRRP packet with different
   virtual system id from local virtual system id is received, the
   packet MUST be discarded.  This field is used for troubleshooting
   misconfigured RBridges.

5.10.   Nickname(s)

   One or more nicknames are associated with the virtual RBridge.  The
   number of nicknames included is specified in the "Count Nicknames"
   field.  These fields are used for troubleshooting misconfigured
   RBridges.


6.  VRRP Protocol State Machine

   The VRRP protocol state machine is not change.  There are three
   states: Initialize, backup and master.  Initialize state is to wait
   for a startup event; backup state is to monitor the availability and
   state of the master RBridge.

   The master BRB election is according to the priority value.  When the
   RBridge is elected as virtual RBridge master, it floods LSP with
   virtual nickname to its' adjacencies.  If the RBridge is the nickname
   owner, it's the virtual nickname master automatically, and floods
   LSPs with owner nickname.  Backup RBridge monitors and receives the
   VRRP packet from master.  If backup RBridge has already enabled IS-IS
   protocol, it should flood LSP to withdraw its nickname LSA.
   Otherwise backup RBridge shouldn't flood LSP to its neighbors.
   Backup RBridge exchanges hello packet with its neighbor, and receives
   LSP from its adjacencies except master RBridgeGBP[not]but never
   advertises local LSA, which is advertised by master RBridge.

7.  IS-IS Adjacency

   Master RBridge should setup and maintain all the adjacencies with
   other RBridges except backup RBridge.  Backup RBridge receives the
   other RBridges hello packets and IS-IS packets (such as LSP, CSNP,
   PSNP) besides master RBridge, but should not send any hello and IS-IS
   packets (LSP, CSNP, PSNP) to other RBridges.  The backup RBridge can
   be detect, 2-way, and report states [TrillAdj].

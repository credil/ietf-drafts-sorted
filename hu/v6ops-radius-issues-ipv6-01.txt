Internet-Draft      RADIUS issues in IPv6 deployments         March 2011


1.  Introduction

   RADIUS is a protocol that provides centralized authentication,
   authorization and accounting management for users to connect network
   services.  In current practical broadband networks, RADIUS is widely
   used by ISPs for AAA when provisioning Framed Services (e.g.  PPPoE)
   to subscribers.  The RADIUS protocol has currently been specified to
   support both IPv4 and IPv6.  Attributes are defined in [RFC3162],
   [RFC4818], [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access] for IPv6 network access.
   While, there are still some issues encountered.

   This document discusses these issues learnt from the IPv6 deployments
   and the possible solutions.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Problem Statement

2.1.  Issue 1: Identifying users of different protocols

   In the deployment model of centralized AAA and network configuration
   assignment, A NAS does not know a-priori whether the user will be
   using IPv4, IPv6, or both.  For example, after RADIUS authentication
   and authorization has completed, the address assignment occurs
   accordingly based on the attributes received (IPv4 related, IPv6
   related, or both) within the RADIUS message, since there have been
   attributes defined to convey configuration information for users of
   different protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, and others).

   For the sake of efficiency and reliability, in many designs, the
   network configuration assignments are distributed and fully
   controlled on the NASes which behave as RADIUS client and work with
   the RADIUS server only for the centralized AAA of users.  In this
   case where the configuration information assignments of different
   network protocols are managed by NAS but not along with the
   centralized authentication and authorization by RADIUS server, a
   means is needed to notify NAS the categories of users according to
   the result of authentication and authorization (based on service
   contracts purchased by users, e.g., IPv4, IPv6 or dual-stack).

   The possible solution:

Internet-Draft      RADIUS issues in IPv6 deployments         March 2011


      Set some 'domains' of users (e.g., 'IPv4 domain', 'IPv6 domain',
      'dual-stack domain') on NAS, each with different profiles (
      configuration information of given protocols) configured, and
      require the users to enclose additional identification when
      sending request message for authentication and authorization, for
      example, an @domainX suffix added to its usename which can be used
      by NAS to classify the users locally before the AAA procedure.
      The trade-off is, this may affect the experience of existing users
      and cost much if significant changes have to be made.

      Or,a dedicated attribute could be defined for the explicit
      notification sent by RADIUS server to NAS according to the result
      of user authentication and authorization.

2.2.  Issue 2: Network or Host on Customer Premises?

   In the provisioning mode where user's network is connected through a
   RG for example, a delegated prefix is needed to be assigned to the RG
   which behaves as the requesting router.  Or in other provisioning
   mode, only a framed IPv6 address/prefix is needed to be assigned to
   the accessing host.  If the assignment is centralized managed by the
   RADIUS server, the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute [RFC4818] or
   Frame-IPv6-Address/Prefix should be used accordingly to convey the
   information to authorized users.  While if the configuration
   information assignment is managed by NAS, there needs a means for
   RADIUS server to notify NAS whether the user is authorized to be
   assigned a delegated prefix or just a framed IPv6 address /prefix to
   its NAS facing interface.

   The possible solution:

      Either to define a dedicated Attribute for the explicit
      notification, or to specify the rule of implementation of
      Attributes related, for example Frame-IPv6-Address/Prefix
      Attribute and Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute with special value
      on RADIUS server for the notification to NAS as an instruction.

2.3.  Issue 3: Protocol Specific Accounting

   Accounting operations and attributes are specified in [RFC2866] to
   collect statistics for all traffic (including IPv4, IPv6, and other
   protocols) over the access service (e.g., Framed).  In current
   practice, generally it is simply treated as the statistics for IPv4
   traffic.  That workswell if only IPv4 connectivity is provided over
   given Framed service (e.g., PPPoE).  While if IPv6 connectivity is
   provided as well, for example, there is no means by which the
   statistics for traffic of respective protocols can be collected.

   The possible solution:

      At lease two sets of attributes for protocol (IPv4, IPv6) specific
      accounting over Framed service (e.g, PPPoE) need to be defined.
      For example:

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv4-Input-Octets

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv4-Output-Octets

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv4-Input-Packets

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv4-Output-Packets

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv4-Input-Gigawords

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv4-Output-Gigawords

      *

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv6-Input-Octets

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv6-Output-Octets

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv6-Input-Packets

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv6-Output-Packets

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv6-Input-Gigawords

      *  Acct-Framed-IPv6-Output-Gigawords

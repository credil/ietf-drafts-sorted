Internet-Draft              MIKEY IANA Rules                    May 2011

1.  Introduction

   This document relaxes the IANA rules for Multimedia Internet KEYing
   (MIKEY) [RFC3830].  The IANA rules defined in [RFC3830], [RFC4563],
   [RFC4909], and [RFC5410] are affected.  In addition, the rules
   specified in [RFC6043] are re-specified here.

   Most of the values in MIKEY namespaces are divided into two ranges:
   "IETF Review" (or "IETF Consensus" as it was previously called) and
   "Reserved for Private Use" [RFC5226].  This document changes, for
   majority of the namespaces, the requirement of "IETF Review" into
   "IETF Review or IESG Approval" [RFC5226].  For some namespaces, the
   requirement is changed to "Specification Required" [RFC5226].

   The rationale for this update is that there can be situations where
   it makes sense to grant an allocation under special circumstances or
   that time has shown that the current requirement is unnecessarily
   strict for some of the namespaces.  By changing the current IANA
   rules to allow also for IESG Approval [RFC5226], it becomes possible
   for the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) to consider an
   allocation request, even if it does not fulfill the default rule.
   For instance, an experimental protocol extension could perhaps
   deserve a new payload type as long as a sufficient number of types
   still remains, and the MIKEY community is happy with such an
   allocation.  Moreover, for some registries a stable specification
   would be a sufficient requirement and hence this is reflected in the
   updated IANA rules.  For instance, for some registries an RFC via the
   Independent Stream at the RFC Editor is sufficient, and does not
   force an IETF evaluation of a particular new extension for which
   there is no general demand.

   This document also makes some small corrections to the existing IANA
   registries.  (RFC Editor: Please remove this paragraph upon
   publication as an RFC.)

   The rest of this document is structured as follows.  Section 2
   defines the new IANA rules.  Section 3 discusses the security
   implications of this document.  Section 4, Section 5, Section 6, and
   Section 7, explain the changes to the RFCs 3830, 4563, 4909, 5410,
   and 6043.


2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the registries related to MIKEY as

Internet-Draft              MIKEY IANA Rules                    May 2011


   specified below.  All other MIKEY IANA registries are to remain
   unchanged.

   A registry for the version field should be created, with the value
   0x01 as the only currently allocated item.  (RFC Editor: Please
   remove the preceding sentence upon publication as an RFC.)  New
   values for the version field ([RFC3830], Section 6.1) and the C
   envelope key cache indicator ([RFC3830], Section 6.3) field can be
   allocated via IETF Review.

   The requirement for adding new values into name spaces, originally
   defined in [RFC3830], and having requirement of "IETF Review" is to
   be changed into "IETF Review or IESG Approval".  This change affects
   the following namespaces:

   o  Data type ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)

   o  Next payload ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)

   o  PRF func ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)

   o  CS ID map type ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)

   o  Encr alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.2)

   o  MAC alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.2)

   o  DH-Group ([RFC3830], Section 6.4)

   o  S type ([RFC3830], Section 6.5)

   o  TS type ([RFC3830], Section 6.6)

   o  ID type ([RFC3830], Section 6.7)

   o  Cert type ([RFC3830], Section 6.7)

   o  Hash func ([RFC3830], Section 6.8)

   o  SRTP Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  SRTP encr alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  SRTP auth alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  SRTP PRF ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  FEC order ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  Key Data Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.13)

   o  KV Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.13)

   The "IETF Review" requirement for the following registries,
   originally defined in [RFC3830], [RFC4563], [RFC4909] and [RFC5410],
   is to be changed into "Specification Required".

   o  Prot type ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  Error no ([RFC3830], Section 6.12)

   o  General Extension Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.15)

   o  KEY ID Type ([RFC4563], Section 4)

   o  OMA BCAST Types ([RFC5410], Section 3)

   The "Specification Required" requirement remains for the following
   namespaces:

   o  TS Role ([RFC6043], Section 6.4)

   o  ID Role ([RFC6043], Section 6.6)

   o  RAND Role ([RFC6043], Section 6.8)

   o  Ticket Type ([RFC6043], Section 6.10)

   The range of valid values for certain namespaces defined in IANA
   considerations of [RFC3830] was not explicitly defined and is
   clarified here as follows:

             +--------------------------------+--------------+
             | Namespace                      | Valid values |
             +--------------------------------+--------------+
             | C envelope key cache indicator | 0 - 3        |
             | S type                         | 0 - 15       |
             | Key Data Type                  | 0 - 15       |
             | KV Type                        | 0 - 15       |
             +--------------------------------+--------------+

   (RFC Editor: please remove this paragraph before publication and when
   the IANA registry has been updated with the following changes) The
   current MIKEY IANA registry defines sub-registries with explicit name
   for certain parameters (e.g., Next Payload) whereas other parameters

Internet-Draft              MIKEY IANA Rules                    May 2011


   (e.g., Encr alg) have no (explicit) sub-registries.  IANA is
   requested to define explicit sub-registries for all the parameters
   with sub-registry names matching the names used in this document.


3.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not change the security properties of MIKEY.
   However, when new values are introduced without IETF consensus, care
   needs to be taken to assure that possible security concerns regarding
   the new values are still addressed.


4.  Changes from RFC 3830

   Section 2 relaxes the requirements from those defined in [RFC3830].
   A number of namespaces now have the "IETF Review or IESG Approval"
   requirement, when they previously had the "IETF Review" requirement.
   In addition, some namespaces now have the "Specification Required"
   requirement.


5.  Changes from RFC 4563

   Section 2 relaxes the requirements from those defined in [RFC4563].
   The KEY ID Type namespace now has the Specification Required
   requirement.


6.  Changes from RFC 4909 and RFC 5410

   Section 2 relaxes the requirements from those defined in [RFC4909].
   The OMA BCAST Types namespace now has the Specification Required
   requirement.  Note that [RFC5410] obsoleted [RFC4909] but does not
   actually define the IANA rules itself.  As a result, from now on this
   RFC defines the IANA requirements for the OMA BCAST Type namespace.


7.  Changes from RFC 6043

   There are no changes to the rules specified in [RFC6043].  However,
   for sake of completeness, Section 2 re-specifies these rules in this
   document, and from now on this RFC defines the IANA requirements for
   those namespaces.

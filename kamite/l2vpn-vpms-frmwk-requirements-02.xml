		<section title="Introduction">

			<section title="Problem Statement">
				<t>
					<xref target="RFC4664"/> describes different types of
					Provider Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs);
					Some of them are widely deployed today, such as
					Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and
					Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).
					A VPWS is a VPN service that supplies a
					Layer 2 (L2) point-to-point service.
					A VPLS is an L2 service that emulates Ethernet LAN service across
					a Wide Area Network (WAN).  
				</t>

				<t>
					For some use cases described hereafter, there are
					P2MP (point-to-multipoint) type services for Layer 2 
					traffic.  However, there is no straightforward way to realize them
					based on the existing L2VPN specifications.
				</t>

				<t>
					In a VPWS, a SP can set up point-to-point connectivity
					per a pair of
					CEs but it is not possible to replicate traffic
					for point-to-multipoint
					services in the SP's network side.  A SP could build
					multiple PWs independently and have the CEs replicate traffic over
					them, but this is not only inconvenient for the customer, it’s a
					waste of bandwidth resources.

				</t>

				<t>
					   In a VPLS, SPs can natively offer multipoint connectivity across
					   their backbone.  Although it is seemingly applicable for point-to-
					   multipoint service as well, there remains extra complexity for SPs to
					   filter unnecessary traffic between irrelevant sites (i.e., from a
					   receiver PE to another receiver PE) because VPLS provides
					   multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity between CEs.  Moreover, VPLS's
					   MAC-based learning/forwarding operation is unnecessary for
					   some scenarios particularly if customers only need simple
					   unidirectional point-to-multipoint service, or if they require non-
					   Ethernet Layer 2 connectivity.
				</t>

				<t>
					Consequently, there is a real need for a solution
					that natively provides point-to-multipoint service in L2VPN.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Scope of This Document">
				<t>
					  VPMS is defined as a Layer 2 service that provides point-to-
					   multipoint connectivity for a variety of Layer2 link layers across an
					   IP or MPLS-enabled PSN.  VPMS is categorized as a class of provider-
					   provisioned Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN).

				</t>

				<t>
					This document introduces a new service framework, reference
					model and functional requirements for
					VPMS by extending the existing
					framework <xref target="RFC4664"/> and requirements
					<xref target="RFC4665"/> for L2VPNs.

		<section title="Use Cases">
			<section title="Ethernet Use Case">
				<t>
					For multicast traffic delivery, there is a requirement to deliver a
					   unidirectional P2MP service in addition to the existing P2P service.
					   The demand is growing to provide private (P2MP native Ethernet) services, for various applications such as IP-
					   based delivery of TV broadcasting, content delivery networks, etc.
					   Moreover, many digital audio/video devices (e.g., MPEG-TS, HD-SDI)
					   that supports Ethernet interfaces are becoming available, which will
					   make Ethernet P2MP service more common.  Also there are some
					   applications that naturally suited to static transport of VPMS.  For
					   example, MPEG-TS/IP/ Ethernet in DVB-H is typically static broadcast
					   without any signaling in the upstream direction.  VPMS could be a
					   possible solution to provide these kinds of networking connectivity
					   over PSNs.
				</t>

				<t>
				   Currently VPLS <xref target="RFC4761"/><xref target="RFC4762"/>
					is able to give P2MP-type
				   replication for Ethernet traffic.  Native VPLS already supports this
				   capability via a full mesh of PWs, and an extension to optimize
				   replication is also proposed [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast] as an
				   additional feature. However, VPLS by nature requires MAC-based
				   learning and forwarding, which might not be needed in some cases by
				   particular users.  Generally, video distribution applications use unidirectional P2MP traffic, but may not always require any added
				   complexity of MAC address management.  In addition, VPLS is a service
				   that essentially provides any-to-any connectivity between all CEs in
				   a L2VPN as it emulates a LAN service. However, if only P2MP
				   connectivity is required, the traffic between different receivers is not always
				   needed, and traffic from receiver to sender is not always needed,
				   either.  In these cases, VPMS is a service that provides much simpler
				   operation.
				</t>
				<t>
					   Note that VPMS provides single coverage of receiver membership; that
					   is, there is no distinct differentiation for multiple multicast
					   groups.  All traffic from a particular Attachment Circuit (AC) will
					   be forwarded toward the same remote receivers, even if the destination MAC
					   address is changed.  Basically in VPMS, destination MAC addresses are
					   not used for forwarding, which is significantly different from VPLS.
					   If MAC-based forwarding is preferred (i.e., multicast/unicast
					   differentiation of MAC address), VPLS should be chosen rather than
					   VPMS.
				</t>


			</section>


			<section title="ATM-based Use Case">
				<t>
					A use case of ATM-based service in VPMS could be to offer the
					capability for 
					service providers to support IP multicast wholesale services over
					ATM
					in case the wholesale customer relies on ATM infrastructure. The 
					P2MP support alleviates the constraint in terms of replication for ATM to 
					support IP multicast services. 
				</t>
				<t>
					   Another use case of VPMS for ATM is for audio/video stream
					   applications.  Today many digital TV broadcasting networks adopt ATM-
					   based distribution systems with point-to-multipoint PVPs/PVCs.  The
					   transport network supports replicating ATM cells in transit nodes to
					   efficiently deliver programs to multiple terminals.  For migrating
					   such ATM-based networks onto IP/MPLS-based networks, VPMS is considered to be
					   a candidate solution.
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="TDM-based Use Case">
				<t>
					   Today the existing VPWS already supports TDM emulation services
					   (SAToP, CESoPSN or TDMoIP).  It is a Layer 1 service, not Layer 2
					   service; however, a common architecture is being used since they are
					   all packet-based emulations over a SP's network.  VPMS is also considered to be a solution for such TDM applications that require
					   point-to-multipoint topology.
				</t>

				<t>
					   In a PSN environment, the existing VPWS allows support for 2G/3G
					   mobile backhauling (e.g.  TDM traffic for GSM's Abis interface, ATM
					   traffic for Release 99 UMTS's Iub interface).  Currently, the
					   Mobile backhauling architecture is always built as a star topology
					   between the 2G/3G controller (e.g.  BSC or RNC) and the 2G/3G Base
					   Stations (BTS or NodeB).  Therefore VPWSes (P2P services) are used
					   between each Base Station and their corresponding controller and
					   nothing more is required.
				</t>
				<t>
					   As far as synchronization in a PSN environment is concerned,
					   different mechanisms can be considered to provide frequency and phase
					   clock required in the 2G/3G Mobile environment to guarantee mobile
					   handover and strict QoS.  One of them consists of using Adaptive
					   Clock Distribution and Recovery.  With this method a Master element
					   distributes a reference clock at protocol level by regularly sending
					   TDM PW packets (SAToP, CESoPSN or TDMoIP) to Slave elements.  This
					   process is based on the fact that the volume of transmitted data
					   arrival is considered as an indication of the source frequency that
					   could be used by the Slave element to recover the source clock
					   frequency.  Consequently, with the current methods, the PE connected
					   to the Master must setup and maintain as many VPWS (P2P) as their are
					   Slave elements, and the Master has to replicate the traffic.  A
					   better solution to deliver the clock frequency would be to use a VPMS
					   which supports P2MP traffic.  This may scale better than P2P
					   services (VPWS) with regards to the forwarding plane at the Master
					   since the traffic is no longer replicated to individual VPWSes (P2P)
					   but only to the AC associated to the VPMS (P2MP).  It may ease the
					   provisioning process since only one source endpoint must be
					   configured at the Ingress PE.  This alleviated provisioning process
					   would simplify the introduction of new Base
					   Stations.  The main gain would be to avoid replication on the Master
					   and hence save bandwidth consumed by the synchronization traffic
					   which typically requires the highest level of QoS.  This kind of
					   traffic will be competing with equivalent QOS traffic like VoIP, which
					   is why it is significant to save the slightest bandwidth.

			<t>
				A VPMS instance is defined as a service entity manageable
				in VPMS architecture.  A single VPMS instance provides
				isolated service reachability domain to each CE, so it
				corresponds to a so-called "VPN" as a specific set of
				sites that allows communication.
				A single VPMS instance provides a unique
				unidirectional point-to-multipoint L2VPN service.  
				In Figure 1, there are two VPMS instances shown,
				VPMS A and VPMS B.  In principle, there is no traffic exchange
				allowed between these different instances, so they are treated
				as different VPNs.
			</t>

			<t>
				In a VPMS, a single CE-PE connection is used for transmitting frames
				for delivery to multiple remote CEs, with point-to-multipoint duplication.
				The SP's network (PE as well as P) has a role to duplicate frames so that
				the traffic source does not need to send multiple frames to individual
				receivers.
			</t>

			<t>
				Like VPWS, an Attachment Circuit (AC) is provided to accommodate CEs
				in a VPMS.  In a VPMS, an AC attached to a VPMS MUST be configured as
				"sender" or "receiver" not both.  That is, any AC is associated with
				the role of either sending side (Tx) or receiving side (Rx) from the
				view of the CE.  Thus every AC deals with unidirectional traffic
				flows.  A sender AC does not have a capability of transmitting the traffic
				back to a CE at upstream side.  Likewise a receiver AC does not
				have a capability of receive the traffic from a CE at downstream side.
				In Figure 1, AC1 and AC3 are configured as senders while AC2,
				AC4, AC5 and AC6 are configured as receivers.  In VPMS A, CE1 could send traffic
				via AC1, but CE2 and CE5 could not send back traffic.
			</t>

			<t>
				A CE which is locally connected to a sender AC
				is called a sender CE.  Also a CE which is locally
				connected to a receiver AC is called a receiver CE.
				However, such CEs’s roles will not be 
				managed directly in VPMS because the configured AC’s role
				(sender or receiver)
				will automatically determine them.
			</t>

			<t>
				Basically there is a one-to-one mapping between an
				attachment circuit and a VPMS instance. 
				For example, all traffic from CE1 to
				PE1 (thorough AC1) is mapped to VPMS A (to CE2 and CE5).
			</t>

				
			<t>
				In a VPMS, PEs will be connected by PW technology which may
				include P2MP traffic optimization (i.e., P2MP PW.  See section 7.2.).
				P2MP traffic optimization will
				provide the benefit of traffic replication for high bandwidth efficiency.
				The sender CE has only to transmit one stream towards the PE and
				it does not have to replicate traffic.  
				Also routed backbone provides
				IP or MPLS-enabled PSN tunnels for transporting the PW traffic.
			</t>

			<t>
				Regarding end-to-end traffic topology between the PEs,
				a single VPMS instance (i.e., one VPN) may correspond
				to a single unidirectional P2MP PW topology. 
				In Figure 1, VPMS A (one instance) has a single P2MP PW
				topology (from PE1 to PE2 and PE3).  However, there
				is also a case that a single VPMS consists of two or more P2MP PW
				topology grouped which is typically used for redundancy.  The
				details are given in section 6.1.2.
			</t>

			<t>
				VPMS can support various Layer 2 protocol services
				such as Ethernet, ATM, etc.

			<section title="Service Topology">

				<section title="Point-to-Multipoint Support">
					<t>
						A solution MUST support unidirectional point-to-multipoint
						connectivity from a sender to multiple receivers.
						A sender CE is assured to send traffic to one or more receiver CEs.
						Receiver CEs include not only the CEs which are located at remote sites,
						but also the local CEs which are connected to the same sender-side PE.
						If there is only one receiver in the instance, it is considered equivalent to
						unidirectional point-to-point traffic.
					</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Multiple Source Support">
					<t>
						A solution MUST support multiple sender topologies in one VPMS
						instance, where a common receiver group is reachable from two or more
						senders.  This means that a solution needs to support having multiple
						P2MP topologies in the backbone whose roots are located apart in a
						common service. In other words, each P2MP topology MUST only have a single sender, however multiple P2MP topologies can be grouped together into a single VPMS instance.
						For example, in Figure 2, traffic from sender CE1
						and CE2 both reach receivers CE3 and CE4 while CE1, CE2, CE3 and CE4
						all are associated with a single service.  This topology is useful
						for increasing service reliability by redundant sources.  Note that
						every receiver has only to have one AC connected to each PE to
						receive traffic. (in Figure 2, AC3 and AC4 respectively).  Thus a
						solution will also need to support protection and restoration
						mechanism combining these multiple P2MP topologies.  (See section 6.4
						too).

				<section title="Reverse Traffic Support">
					<t>
						There are cases where a reverse traffic flow is necessary.  A sender CE
						might sometimes want to receive traffic from a receiver CE.
						There are some usage scenarios for this, such as stream monitoring through a
						loopback mechanism, control channels which need feedback communication
						etc.  The simplest way to accomplish this is to provide different
						VPMS instances for reverse traffic, i.e. a sender CE is a receiver
						of another VPMS instance.
					</t>

					<t>
						Figure 3 illustrates this kind of reverse traffic scenario,
						where CE1 is configured as a sender in VPMS A and a receiver
						in VPMS B. VPMS B is used for reverse traffic.
						Note that a closed single
						network here is composed of two VPMS instances.  In operational
						terms, CE1 and CE4 belong to the same closed "VPN" by
						administrative policy (e.g., CE1,
						CE2, CE3 and CE4 are the devices in one enterprise's intranet
						network).
					</t>
					<t>
						Such bi-directional instances can be easily created if two distinct
						ACs are provisioned for sending and receiving exclusively (e.g., if
						VLAN id in dot1Q tagged frame is a service delimiter, different VLAN
						ids are uniquely allocated for Tx and Rx).  This approach is
						acceptable if a receiver CE device can change Layer 2 interface
						appropriately in data transmitting and receiving.
					</t>

					<t>
						Meanwhile it is also true that this might be considered a limitation
						in some deployment scenarios.  If a CE is an IP router or Ethernet
						bridge, reverse traffic is normally expected to be received on the
						same interface as forward traffic on the receiver CE. (i.e., the same VLAN id is to be
						used for reverse traffic if the AC supports dot1Q tagged frames.)
					</t>

					<t>
						Therefore, in a VPMS solution,
						both of the two type of ACs, sending (Tx) and receiving (Rx), 
						SHOULD be allowed to be placed in the same physical/virtual
						circuit.
						In Figure 3, suppose 
						AC5 of VPMS A is provisioned as {VLAN id = 100, direction= Rx}.
						It is expected that operators can provision AC6 of VPMS B 
						in the same physical port as
						{VLAN id = 100, direction = Tx}.
						That is, the combination between VLAN id and the flow direction 
						is now considered to be a service delimiter.
					</t>
					<t>
						Note, in most implementations of VPWS today, every AC is always
						considered bidirectional and a unique Layer 2 header/circuit (ATM
						VPI/VCI, an Ethernet port, a VLAN etc.) is considered the service
						delimiter.  In contrast in VPMS, every AC is considered
						unidirectional and traffic direction is an additional element to
						identify a unique AC.

			<section title="Transparency">
				<t>
					A solution is intended to provide Layer 2 traffic transparency.
					Transparency SHOULD be honoured per VPMS instance basis.
					In other words, Layer 2 traffic can be transparently transported
					from a sender CE to receiver CEs in a given instance.  Note, however,
					if service delimiting fields (VLAN Id in Ethernet, VPI/VCI in ATM,
					DLCI in FR etc.) are assigned by SP, they are not transparent.  It
					depends on SP’s choice if they are assigned at each AC.  Hence it
					could be that some of receiver CEs are getting traffic with different
					delimiting fields than the other receiver CEs.
				</t>

				<t>
					VPMS solution SHOULD NOT require any special packet processing by the
					end users (CEs).
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Quality of Service (QoS)">
				<t>
					A customer may require that the VPMS service provide the guaranteed QoS.
					In particular, for real time applications which are considered common
					in point-to-multipoint delivery, delay and loss sensitive traffic
					MUST be supported.  The solution SHOULD provide native QoS techniques
					for service class differentiation, 
					such as IEEE 802.1p CoS for Ethernet.
				</t>
				<t>
					For bandwidth committed services (e.g., ATM CBR),
					a solution SHOULD guarantee end-to-end bandwidth.
					It MAY provide flow admission control mechanisms to achieve that.
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="Protection and Restoration">
				<t>
					A solution MUST provide protection and restoration mechanism
					for end-to-end services.
				</t>

				<section title="Dual-homed Access Support">
					<t>
						A solution MUST allow dual-homed redundant access from a CE to
						multiple PEs.  Additionally, a solution SHOULD provide
						protection mechanism between the different PEs to which a CE is attached.  This is because
						when an ingress PE node fails whole traffic delivery will fail unless
						a backup sender PE is provided, even in case of dual-homed access.
						Similarly, if an egress PE node fails, traffic toward that CE is never
						received unless a backup egress PE is provided.  Figure 4 is an example for this access topology.
					</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Single/Dual Traffic Support in Dual-homed Access">
					<t>
						When dual-homed access to sender PEs is provided, a solution MAY allow a sender CE to 
						transmit just a single copy of the traffic to either one of the two sender PEs, or to
						transmit a copy of the traffic to both the PEs simultaneously.  The latter
						scenario consumes more resource of CE-PE link than
						the single traffic scenario, but it is usually applicable when a source device has only a simple
						forwarding capability without any switchover functionality.
						In the dual traffic case, the backup ingress PE SHOULD be able to
						filter the incoming unnecessary traffic while active PE is working.  Also in either case,
						single traffic or dual traffic, the protection mechanism of ingress
						PEs described in the previous subsection will be necessary to handle
						the traffic appropriately.
					</t>
					<t>
						In the case of dual-homed access to receiver PEs, a solution MAY allow a receiver CE to
						receive a single copy of the traffic from either one of the two egress PEs, or receive
						a copy of the traffic from both PEs simultaneously.
						The dual
						traffic approach is applicable if CE has fast switchover capability
						as a receiver by selecting either one of incoming traffic,
						but note that additional traffic resources are always
						consumed at PE-CE link of backup side.
						Specifically in the single traffic case, it might be needed to
						support switchover mechanism between egress PEs in failure.

			<section title="Pseudo Wire Signaling and PSN Tunneling">
				<t>
					A VPMS solution SHOULD provide an efficient replication that can
					contribute to optimizing the bandwidth usage required in a
					SP's network.  For supporting efficient replication, it is expected
					to take advantage of PW and PSN mechanisms that are capable of
					P2MP traffic.
				</t>
				<t>
					Regarding PW mechanism, 
					<xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements"/>
					introduces P2MP PW concept and its requirements, showing two basic approaches of providing
					replication.  One is SS (Single Segment)-PW model that
					provides replication by PSN tunnel such as P2MP LSP (i.e., by outer
					label layer), and the other is MS (Multi Segment)-PW model
					that provides replication by multiple interconnected PWs
					(i.e., by inner label layer).  In either case, end-to-end P2MP
					topology in VPMS is common from the view of PEs and ACs.
					Requirements as a provider service specified in this document
					will be commonly applied regardless of P2MP PW's signaling model.  
				</t>

				<t>
					This document does not raise any specific requirements for
					particular PSN tunneling schemes (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and
					multipoint-to-multipoint) that is applied only to VPMS.
					The actual type of PSN tunnel used in VPMS
					will be dependent on individual deployment scenarios
					(e.g., which PSN protocol is available now in the core and how much
					network resources operators will want to optimize).
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="Discovering VPMS Related Information">
				<t>
					A solution SHOULD support auto-discovery methods that dynamically
					allow VPMS information to be discovered by the PEs to minimize the
					amount of configuration the SP must perform.
				</t>
				<t>
					All of the requirements on discovery described in 
					Section 7.3 of <xref target="RFC4665"/>
					SHOULD be satisfied in VPMS as well.
				</t>

				<t>
					Auto-discovery will help operators' initial configuration of
					adding a new VPN (i.e., VPMS instance),
					adding/deleting new sender/receiver, and so on.
				</t>

				<t>
					The information related to remote sites will be as follows:
				</t>
					<t>
						<list style='hanging'>
							<t hangText='-'>
								Information to identify the VPMS instance
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
								PE router ID / IP address as location information
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
								Information to identify Attachment Circuits
								and their associated group information to 
								compose a unique service (i.e., VPMS instance). 
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
								AC role in each VPMS (Sender or Receiver)
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
								SP-related information (AS number, etc. for an inter-provider case)
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>

				<t>
					Following is an example scenario:  by default,
					every PE will have the association among the information
					described above.  Suppose a new PE having an AC is provisioned
					in the existing VPMS instance and this AC is configured as receiver.
					This information will be automatically discovered by the
					other existing remote PEs (i.e., ingress and egress PEs
					in the same VPMS instance). Once the ingress PE discovers
					this new PE/AC, it can automatically add it as the new leaf
					of P2MP topology according to P2MP PW signaling mechanism.
					This operation does not require any new configuration at
					the existing PEs.
				</t>
			</section>

		
			<section title="Activation and Deactivation">

				<t>
					This section raises generic requirements for handling related
					information about remote sites after the initial provisioning to ease the
					total operation of VPMS.
				</t>

				<t>
					A solution SHOULD provide a way to 
					activate/deactivate the administrative status of each CE/AC.
					After initial provisioning, 
					a SP might change connectivity configuration 
					between particular CEs inside a single VPMS instance
					for operational reasons.  This feature will be beneficial to
					help such a scenario.
				</t>
				<t>
					For example, in Figure 5,
					CE1, CE3, CE4 and CE5 (and their ACs) are initially provisioned 
					for VPMS A.  CE2 is not provisioned for any VPMSes.  In VPMS A, CE1 is
					a sender and CE3, CE4 and CE5 are receivers.
					Traffic will usually flow from CE1 to all
					receivers, CE3, CE4 and CE5.  However, for maintenance operation,
					application's request (e.g., stream program has changed) or some other reasons,
					CE4 needs to
					be set as administratively deactivated.  Then it becomes necessary to
					turn off traffic from PE4 to CE4.  This operation
					must be appropriately distinguished from failure cases.
				</t>

				<t>
					When deactivating a particular site, backbone PSN/PW resources (e.g.,
					admission control of PSN tunnel) MAY be released for that particular
					direction in order to provide that bandwidth to other services.  In
					Figure 5, CE3 is now administratively activated and receiving traffic.
					However, if CE3 comes to be administratively deactivated, and if
					RSVP-TE (including P2P and/or P2MP) is used for backbone PSN, then TE
					reserved resources from PE1 to PE3 may be released.
				</t>

				<t>
					In addition, a solution SHOULD allow single-sided activation
					operation at a sender PE.  In some scenarios, operators prefer
					centralized operation.  This is often considered natural for one-way
					digital audio/video distribution applications: SPs often want to
					complete their service delivery by a single operation at one source
					PE, not by multiple operations at many receiver PEs.  Figure 5
					illustrates this scenario, where a SP only has to do single-sided
					operation at PE1 (source) to administratively activate/deactivate
					various connections from AC1 to AC3, AC4 and/or AC5.  It is not
					needed to perform operations on PE3 and PE4 directly.

			<section title="Inter-AS Support">
				<t>
					A solution SHOULD support inter-AS scenarios, where there is more
					than one provider providing a common VPMS instance and VPN.  More
					specifically, it is necessary to consider the case where some of the
					PEs that compose one VPMS belong to several different ASes.
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="Co-existence with Existing L2VPNs">
				<t>
					A solution MUST co-exist with the existing L2VPNs
					(e.g., VPWS, VPLS)
					across the same SP's network.  A solution MUST NOT impede
					the operation
					of auto-discovery and signalling mechanism that
					are already supported by the PEs for those existing L2VPNs.
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="Operation, Administration and Maintenance">
				<section title="Fault Management">
					<section title="Fault Detection">
						<t>
							A solution MUST provide tools that detect reachability failure and traffic looping of P2MP transport in a VPMS instance.  If multiple sources are supported (i.e., multiple P2MP topologies are grouped together into a single VPMS instance), such tools MUST be able to perform distinguishing each P2MP topology. 
						</t>
					</section>
					<section title="Fault Notification">
						<t>
							A solution MUST provide fault notification and trouble tracking mechanisms. (e.g.  SNMP-trap and syslog that notify fault to remote NMS.)
						</t>
						<t>
							In VPMS one point of failure at upstream often affects a number of downstream PEs and ACs that might raise a notification message.  Hence notification messages MAY be summarized or compressed for operators' ease of management.
						</t>
						<t>
							In case of receiver-side failure (receiver PE or its AC), this fault status SHOULD be able to be monitored at sender PE.  This will help an operator to monitor each receiver PEs/AC in a centralized manner; that is, a sender PE can collect receiver-side information.  How this status is transferred depends on a solution.
						</t>
						<t>
							In contrast, in case of sender-side failure (sender PE or its AC), this fault status SHOULD also be able to be monitored at receiver PEs. This will help an operator to troubleshoot at receiver PEs (i.e., distinguish local AC’s failure from remote upstream AC’s failure easily). 
						</t>
						<t>
							In any case of failure at SP’s network, fault information MAY be notified to the customer.  Specifically, such fault MAY trigger generating customer OAM message toward CEs (e.g., AIS) and/or shutting down receiver ACs.
						</t>
					</section>
					<section title="Fault Isolation">
						<t>
							A solution MUST provide diagnostic/troubleshooting tools
							for P2MP transport in a VPMS instance.  
						</t>
					</section>

				</section>

				<section title="Testing">
					<t>
						A solution MUST provide a mechanism for testing each P2MP connectivity and verifying the associated information in a VPMS instance.  The connectivity is between sender and all receiver ACs.
					</t>
					<t>
						Operators will run testing before and after service activation.  Testing mechanism SHOULD support end-to-end testing of the data path used by customer's data.  End-to-end testing will have CE-to-CE path test and PE-to-PE path test.  A solution MUST support PE-to-PE path test and MAY support CE-to-CE path test.  In either case the data path provided for each VPMS is unidirectional, hence if loopback testing is supported, additional consideration about reverse-path might also be needed (see section 6.1.3). 
					</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Performance Management">
					<t>
						A solution MUST offer mechanisms to monitor traffic performance parameters and statistics in each P2MP traffic.   
					</t>
					<t>
						A solution MUST provide access to:
					</t>
					<t>
						<list style='hanging'>
							<t hangText='-'>
								Traffic statistics (total traffic forwarded, incoming, outgoing, dropped, etc., by period of time)
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>
						A solution SHOULD provide access to:
					</t>
					<t>
						<list style='hanging'>
							<t hangText='-'>
								Performance information related to traffic usage, e.g., one-way delay, one-way jitter, one-way loss, delay variations (the difference of various one-way delay from a particular sender PE to multiple receiver PEs) etc.
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>
						All or part of this information SHOULD be made available through standardized SNMP MIB Modules (Management Information Base).
					</t>
					<t>
						It is expected that such information can be used for SLA monitoring between sender and receiver, to give the SP a clear picture of current service providing to the customer.

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF
   Last Call.

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and
   insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published
   RFC has IETF Consensus.]


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

   In the MPLS-TP requirements [RFC 5654] it is highlighted that an
   MPLS-TP architecture must allow interworking with new and already
   deployed IP/MPLS networks.

1.2.  Scope of this document

   This document illustrates the most likely deployment scenarios
   between MPLS-TP and IP/MPLS, in case of network partitioning
   relationship between them.  For each of the examined scenarios
   interworking aspects, limitations, issues and open points, with
   particular focus on OAM capabilities, are provided.

   The main architectural construct considered in this document foresees
   PWE3 Protocol Stack Reference Model, however also MPLS Protocol Stack
   Reference Model is used.  See [draft mpls-tp framework] for details.

   Note: due to the early level of definition of CP of MPLS-TP, any
   possible interaction between CP of IP/MPLS and CP of MPLS-TP is left
   for further study.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Statement

   This document addresses the case of network decomposition related to
   partitioning relationship.  Interworking aspects, limitations, issues
   and open points are described.

   o  MPLS-TP NE: a NE that supports MPLS-TP functions

   o  MPLS-TP Network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed

   o  Node: either MPLS-TP NE, IP/MPLS NE or CE (Customer Edge)

   o  Ingress direction: from client to network

   o  Egress direction: from network to client

   For each of the scenarios described in this document, two paragraphs
   may appear, one related to possible issues already envisaged by the
   authors (Open Issues), the other related to aspects still left for
   further study and/or definition (Open Points).

   This Section provides some terminology about network partitioning.
   Primarily source of those definitions is [ITU-T G.805].  Readers
   already familiar with these concepts can skip this Section.

5.1.  Network Partitioning

   The following figure illustrates the Network Partitioning concept:


     ___     ___       ____                ____     ___       ___
   _/   \___/   \    _/    \__           _/    \___/   \    _/   \__
  /              \__/         \         /               \__/        \_
 /                              \  |   /                              \
|     Sub-Network Domain 1      |+++++|    Sub-Network Domain 2        |
 \                              /  |   \                              /
  \   __      ___     __      _/        \   ___      ___     __     _/
   \_/  \____/   \___/  \____/           \_/   \____/   \___/  \___/



                           Network Partitioning

                                 Figure 1

   The boundary between the two subnetworks can be a link (as defined by
   [ITU-T G.805]), but also a Node, which in this case SHALL be able to
   handle the technologies of both subnetworks.

   The two subnetworks are at the same level.  Some readers will also
   call this concept "Peer model".

6.  Elements used in the figures

   A legenda of the symbols, which are most used in the following
   Sections, is provided, in order to facilitate comprehension of the
   scenarios.


          Node:
           -----  Direct connection
           - - -  Virtual connection
           .....  one or more direct connections

          Layers:
           |      Termination
           +      Connection
           <->    Stitching

           OAM:
           > or < MEP (Maintenance Association End Point)
           O      MIP (Maintenance Association Intermediate Point)



                                 Figure 2


7.  Network Partitioning

   This Section provides some deployment scenarios, using the
   partitioning concept described in Section 5.

   In the rest of this Section the following assumptions apply:

   o  Customer network is carried partly over IP/MPLS subnetwork (e.g.
      via PW encapsulation) and partly over MPLS-TP subnetwork.

   o  IP/MPLS network is deployed over Ethernet (at least on interfaces
      interconnecting to the MPLS-TP subnetwork)

   o  MPLS-TP subnetwork is deployed over Ethernet, however other server
      layers are possible (not shown in this document)

   For the purposes of this Section, MPLS-TP subnetwork is deployed
   between a CE and an IP/MPLS subnetwork.  Other kinds of deployment
   are possible (not shown in this document), for instance:

   o  More than two subnetworks are deployed between the CEs

   o  MPLS-TP can be deployed between two subnetworks

7.1.  Border Node

   Main features to be taken into account:

   o  MultiSegment Pseudowire

   o  LSP Stitching

   o  Network Interworking

   o  End-to-End OAM support

   o  Interaction between DP (Data Plane) of IP/MPLS and DP of MPLS-TP

   o  Interaction between CP (Control Plane) of IP/MPLS and CP of
      MPLS-TP

   o  Interaction between MP (Management Plane) of IP/MPLS and MP of
      MPLS-TP

   o  No need of PHP handling by MPLS-TP node

7.1.1.  Multisegment Pseudowire

   The following figure illustrates the functional interworking among
   the networks:

   Several levels of OAM are possible, a subset of them is shown in the
   previous figure, however these are not comprehensive, any subset of
   them MAY be configured in a network.  A brief description of the
   different levels is provided:

      (3) Edge-to-Edge MPLS/MPLS-TP OAM on partitioned network (at PW
      level)

      (2) Edge-to-Edge MPLS/MPLS-TP OAM on partitioned network (at LSP
      level)

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kind)

   Open Points:

   o  Interworking between LSP OAM (2) and MS-PW OAM (3) is still to be
      cleared/defined

   o  Edge-to-Edge MS-PW OAM (3) must be configured on different
      subnetworks

   Note: in this case a SS-PW extends over the subnetworks as the

   Several levels of OAM are possible, a subset of them is shown in the
   previous figure, however these are not comprehensive, any subset of
   them MAY be configured in a network.  A brief description of the
   different levels is provided:

      (4) Edge-to-Edge MPLS/MPLS-TP OAM on partitioned network (at PW
      level)

      (3) Edge-to-Edge MPLS/MPLS-TP OAM on partitioned network (at LSP
      level)

      (2) Edge-to-Edge MPLS/MPLS-TP OAM on partitioned network (at TCM
      level)

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kind)

   Open Points:

   o  Edge-to-Edge LSP OAM (3) must be configured on different
      subnetworks

8.  Conclusions

   This document has illustrated some deployment scenarios where a
   partitioning relationship is in place between MPLS-TP and IP/MPLS.
   Where open points and open issues still appear, the reader is invited
   to contribute to their resolution.

   The following scenarios is recommended:

      Network Partitioning

         Border Link, using Multisegment Pseudowire

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   MPLS-TP is a joint ITU-IETF effort to include the MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS architecture to support the capabilities
   and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by
   ITU-T.  In the MPLS-TP requirements [RFC 5654] it is highlighted that
   an MPLS-TP architecture must allow interworking with new and already
   deployed IP/MPLS networks.

1.2.  Scope of this document

   This document illustrates the most likely deployment scenarios
   between MPLS-TP and IP/MPLS, in case of network layering relationship
   between them.  For each of the examined scenarios interworking
   aspects, limitations, issues and open points, with particular focus
   on OAM capabilities and control plane, are provided.

   The main architectural construct considered in this document foresees
   PWE3 Protocol Stack Reference Model, however also MPLS Protocol Stack
   Reference Model is used.  See [draft mpls-tp framework] for details.

   Note: due to the early level of definition of CP of MPLS-TP, any
   possible interaction between CP of IP/MPLS and CP of MPLS-TP is left
   for further study.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

4.  Problem Statement

   This document addresses the case of network decomposition related to
   layering relationship.  The scenarios illustrated foresee MPLS-TP
   network as a server network, IP/MPLS as a client network.
   Interworking aspects, limitations, issues and open points are
   described.

   Note: the presented scenarios are not intended to be comprehensive.

5.  Terminology

   As far as this document is concerned, the following terminology is
   used:

   o  IP/MPLS NE: a NE that supports IP/MPLS functions

   o  IP/MPLS Network: a network in which IP/MPLS NEs are deployed

   o  MPLS-TP NE: a NE that supports MPLS-TP functions

   o  MPLS-TP Network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed

   o  Node: either MPLS-TP NE, IP/MPLS NE or CE

   o  Ingress direction: from client to network

   o  Egress direction: from network to client

   For each of the scenarios described in this document, two paragraphs
   may appear, one related to possible issues already envisaged by the
   authors (Open Issues), the other related to aspects still left for
   further study and/or definition (Open Points).

   This Section provides some terminology about network layering and
   partitioning.  Primarily source of those definitions is [ITU-T
   G.805].  Readers already familiar with these concepts can skip this
   Section.

7.  Network Layering

   This Section provides some deployment scenarios, using the layering
   concept described in Section 5.

   In the rest of this Section the following assumptions apply:

   o  Customer network is carried over IP/MPLS (e.g. via PW
      encapsulation)

   o  IP/MPLS network is client of MPLS-TP subnetwork

7.1.  Ethernet encapsulation over MPLS-TP

   IP/MPLS network is deployed over Ethernet (at least on interfaces
   interconnecting to the MPLS-TP subnetwork).  The interworking is done
   via Ethernet frame encapsulation in PW over MPLS-TP (as per PWE3
   Protocol Stack Reference Model).  MPLS-TP LSPs are pre-configured
   with respect to IP/MPLS LSPs and may be seen as forwarding
   adjacencies by IGP instance of IP/MPLS networks.

   The following figure illustrates the functional interworking among
   the networks:

                                 Figure 3

   The LSR 3 and 7 are one hop away from the IP/MPLS layer point of
   view, CP/MP of IP/MPLS is transparently transported by MPLS-TP
   network.

   The service provided by the MPLS-TP network could be an E-Line
   service realized via VPWS in case of port based service interface and
   p2p connectivity between LSR 3 and LSR 7 or multiple E-Line services
   in case of VLAN based service interface (e.g.  LSR3 could be
   connected to more that one LSRs through the MPLS-TP network).  In
   both of the above cases the LER4 and 6 do not need to know that above
   the Ethernet layer there is an MPLS LSP.

   The following figure illustrates the stacking relationship among the
   technology layers and OAM relationship among the networks:

   Several levels of OAM are shown in the previous figure, these are not
   comprehensive (e.g.  Ethernet OAM defines several levels for each
   layer) and any subset of them MAY be configured in a network.  A
   brief description of the different levels is provided:

      (6) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on IP/MPLS network (at PW level)

      (5) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on IP/MPLS network (at LSP level)

      (4) Router-to-Router Eth OAM on IP/MPLS network

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kinds)

   Note that the OAM layers not directly related to MPLS-TP network have
   been reported just for completeness of the scenario, however their
   behaviour and interworking are out of scope of this document.

   Control Plane aspects:

   In this scenario, IP/MPLS packets are carried over Attachment
   Circuits (ACs), each of which connects MPLS-TP CE (Node 3 and 7 in
   Figure 4) and PE (Node 4 and 6), and an Ethernet PW between the PEs.
   The Ethernet PW is setup over one or more MPLS-TP LSPs.  The MPLS-TP
   network may have its own IGP independent from the IP/MPLS IGP.  The
   Ethernet PW may be advertised by the IP/MPLS IGP as a forwarding
   adjacency so that it can be used for IP/MPLS path computation. if the
   MPLS-TP network has a C-plane, it can interwork with the IP/MPLS
   C-plane via UNI signaling, such as OIF UNI 2.0 [OIF UNI 2.0].  In
   Figure 4, Node 3 and Node 7 work as UNI-C devices, while Node 4 and
   Node 6 work as UNI-N devices.  It is also possible to implement UNI-C
   and/or UNI-N function in centralized entities called "UNI Proxies"
   [OIF UNI 2.0].  The Ethernet PW over MPLS-TP is dynamically setup/
   modified/released, typically using PW signaling, in response to the
   UNI signaling.  The MPLS-TP LSP may be statically configured or
   dynamically setup/modified/released , typically using MPLS-TP
   signaling, based on its own policy in accordance with the PW status.

   Open Points:

   o  Interworking between LSP OAM (2), PW OAM (3) and ETH OAM (4) is
      still to be cleared/defined; it could imply fault indication,
      alarm suppression, etc.

7.2.  Transparent transport of IP/MPLS

   In this scenario the physical interface between the IP/MPLS and the
   MPLS-TP network is generic and may be other that Ethernet (e.g.
   POS); the interworking is done via client LSP packet encapsulation in
   PW over MPLS-TP (as per PWE3 Protocol Stack Reference Model).
   MPLS-TP LSPs are pre-configured with respect to IP/MPLS LSPs and may
   be seen as forwarding adjacencies by IGP instance of IP/MPLS
   networks.

   The following figure illustrates the functional interworking among
   the networks:

   The LSR 3 and 7 are one hop away from the IP/MPLS layer point of
   view.

   This scenario includes at least two cases for data plane
   implementation.  In the first case, IP/MPLS packets are carried over
   Attachment Circuits (ACs), each of which connects MPLS-TP CE (Node 3
   and 7 in Figure 6) and PE (Node 4 and 6), and an IP/MPLS PW between
   the PEs.  The IP/MPLS PW is setup over one or more MPLS-TP LSPs.  In
   the second case, IP/MPLS packets are carried over Attachment Circuits
   (ACs), each of which connects MPLS-TP CE and PE, and an MPLS-TP LSP
   which provides the Network Layer Transport Service [draft mpls-tp
   framework] between the PEs.  The first case is described in the
   following.

   The service provided by the MPLS-TP network is p2p; client traffic is
   separated on a per port basis, so that all traffic coming from
   interface toward LSR 3 is transparently transported to LSR 7 and

   viceversa.  The client traffic to be encapsulated is both client MPLS
   packet (client DP) and IP packet (client CP and MP), encapsulation is
   performed via PWs, that is, one PW is needed for the DP (LSP) and one
   for the CP/MP (IP).

   An LSP for IP packets devoted for CP must be pre-configured in order
   to enable the interworking scenario.  If CP interaction between IP/
   MPLS and MPLS-TP is not enabled then the LSP for carrying out MPLS
   packets (client DP) must be pre-configured.

   technology layers and OAM relationship among the networks:

   Several levels of OAM are possible, a subset of them is shown in the

   them MAY be configured in a network.  A brief description of the
   levels is provided:

      (5) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on IP/MPLS network (at PW level)

      (4) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on IP/MPLS network (at LSP level)

      (3) Edge-to-Edge MPLS-TP OAM on MPLS-TP network (at PW level)

      (2) Edge-to-Edge MPLS-TP OAM on MPLS-TP network (at LSP level)

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kinds)

   Control Plane aspects:

   MPLS-TP network may have its own IGP independent from the IP/MPLS
   IGP.  The IP/MPLS PW or the MPLS-TP LSP may be advertised by the IP/
   MPLS IGP as a forwarding adjacency so that it can be used for IP/MPLS
   path computation.  If the MPLS-TP network has a C-plane, it can
   interwork with the IP/MPLS C-plane via UNI signaling, such as OIF UNI
   2.0 [OIF UNI 2.0].  In Figure 6, Node 3 and Node 7 work as UNI-C
   devices, while Node 4 and Node 6 work as UNI-N devices.  It is also
   possible to implement UNI-C and/or UNI-N function in centralized
   entities called "UNI Proxies" [OIF UNI 2.0].  In the first case
   mentioned above, the IP/MPLS PW over MPLS-TP is dynamically setup/
   modified/released, typically using PW signaling, in response to the
   UNI signaling.  The MPLS-TP LSP may be statically configured or
   dynamically setup/modified/released, typically using MPLS-TP
   signaling, based on its own policy in accordance with the PW status.
   In the second case, the MPLS-TP LSP is dynamically setup/modified/
   released, typically using MPLS-TP signaling, in response to the UNI
   signaling.

   Open Points:

   o  This scenario needs the definition of MPLS packets and IP packets
      encapsulation in PW.

   o  This scenario needs extension of the OIF UNI 2.0 to support IP/
      MPLS services.

   o  Interworking between MPLS-TP network OAM ((2), (3)) and IP/MPLS
      network OAM ((4), (5)) is still to be cleared/defined; it could
      imply fault indication, alarm suppression, etc.

   o  Interaction between IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP CPs is still to be
      cleared/defined

7.3.  IP/MPLS / MPLS-TP hybrid edge node

   The following main features SHOULD be taken into account:

   o  Two or more client interfaces MAY be involved in the service

   o  Peering of client DP (label swapping of client MPLS packets)

   o  Possible tunneling of MP of client MPLS Layer

   o  Possible peering/tunneling CP of client MPLS Layer

   o  Possible handling of PHP of client MPLS Layer

7.3.1.  IP/MPLS does not require PHP from MPLS-TP

   In this scenario the edge nodes of the MPLS-TP subnetwork are one hop
   away from the client node of the IP/MPLS network.

   the networks.

   The Node 4 and 6 in the above figure act as dual function:

   o  LSR of client IP/MPLS network

   o  LER of server MPLS-TP subnetwork

   In this scenario, PE nodes of the MPLS-TP network (Node 4 and Node 6
   in Figure 8) are hybrid of IP/MPLS LSR and MPLS-TE LER functions.
   There are at least two cases for data plane implementation between
   the IP/MPLS LSR function in Node 4 and the one in Node 6.  The first
   case is to use an IP/MPLS PW which is setup over one or more MPLS-TP
   LSPs.  The second case is to use an MPLS-TP LSP which provides the
   Network Layer Transport Service [draft mpls-tp framework].  The first
   case is described in the following.

   The MPLS-TP network may have its own IGP independent from the IP/MPLS
   IGP.  Node 4 and Node 6 may be involved in both the IP/MPLS and
   MPLS-TP IGPs.  The IP/MPLS PW or the MPLS-TP LSP may be advertised by
   the IP/MPLS IGP as a forwarding adjacency so that it can be used for
   IP/MPLS path computation.  Node 4 and Node 6 may also be involved in
   the IP/MPLS signaling.  An IP/MPLS LSP can be setup by signaling
   along the route Node 3 - Node 4 - Node 6 - Node 7, and vice versa.
   The signaling messages may be carried over the IP/MPLS PW or the
   MPLS-TP LSP.  In the first case mentioned above, the IP/MPLS PW and
   the MPLS-TP LSP may be statically configured or dynamically setup/
   modified/released based on their own policies in accordance with the
   IP/MPLS LSP status.  In the second case, the MPLS-TP LSP may be
   statically configured or dynamically setup/modified/released based on
   its own policy in accordance with the IP/MPLS LSP status.

   Open Points:

   o  Interworking between MPLS-TP network OAM ((2), (3)) and IP/MPLS
      network OAM ((4), (5)) is still to be cleared/defined; it could
      imply fault indication, alarm suppression, etc.

   o  Interaction between IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP CPs is still to be
      cleared/defined

   o  MPLS-TP edge nodes provides Forwarding Adjacency to the IP/MPLS
      network; this handling is left for further study.

   In this scenario the edge nodes of the MPLS-TP subnetwork are one hop
   away from at least one client node (of the IP/MPLS network) requiring
   PHP.

                                 Figure 9

   The Node 4 and 6 in the above figure act as dual function:

   o  LSR of client IP/MPLS network

   o  LER of server MPLS-TP subnetwork

   As Node 8 of client IP/MPLS network requires PHP, Node 6 which act as
   penultimate hop is required to drop LSP label of client IP/MPLS
   tunnel (indicated in direction from center to right on Node 6).

   The following figure illustrates the stacking relationship among the
   technology layers and OAM relationship among the networks:

         IP/MPLS encapsulation over MPLS-TP - Layers and OAM view

                                 Figure 10

   Several levels of OAM are possible, a subset of them is shown in the
   previous figure, however these are not comprehensive, any subset of
   them MAY be configured in a network.  A brief description of the
   different levels is provided:

      (4) Edge-to-Edge MPLS OAM on IP/MPLS network (at PW level)

      (3) Edge-to-Edge MPLS-TP OAM on MPLS-TP network (at PW level)

      (2) Edge-to-Edge MPLS-TP OAM on MPLS-TP network (at LSP level)

      (1) Physical level OAM (MAY be of several kinds)

   Open Issues:

   o  As in the IP/MPLS network the LSP, which is tunneled over MPLS-TP
      network, is terminated on a Node requiring PHP (Node 8), IP/MPLS
      OAM cannot be used at LSP level, so monitoring can be performed at
      PW level.

   o  Interworking on Node 6 between MPLS-TP OAM and IP/MPLS OAM (at PW
      level) MAY be performed in egress direction, but its details are
      out of scope of this document.

   o  Interworking between MPLS-TP OAM and IP/MPLS OAM (at PW level)
      SHOULD NOT be performed in ingress direction, due to independence
      of layers.

   Open Points:

   o  Interworking between MPLS-TP network OAM ((2), (3)) and IP/MPLS
      network OAM (4) is still to be cleared/defined

   o  Interaction between IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP CPs is still to be
      cleared/defined

   o  MPLS-TP edge nodes provides Forwarding Adjacency to the IP/MPLS
      network; this handling is left for further study.


8.  Conclusions

   This document has illustrated some deployment scenarios where a
   layering raltionship is in place between MPLS-TP (server layer) and
   IP/MPLS (client layer).  Where open points and open issues still
   appear, the reader is invited to contribute to their resolution.

   The following scenarios are recommended:

      Network Layering

         Ethernet encapsulation over MPLS-TP

         Transparent transport of IP/MPLS

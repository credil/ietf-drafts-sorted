1.  Introduction

   This document presents a method that allowing a Customer Edge (CE) to
   automatically control the up-and-down bandwidth of the hose interface
   in the Hose VPN Model.  For instance, in the hose VPN method, when a
   CE transmits great deal of data to other client /clients of the same
   hose VPN, it could send message automatically to the provider edge
   and other client (or clients) for applying to increase the bandwidth.
   When the transmittal is finished, the sending and the receiving CE
   will automatically decrease the send and the receive bandwidth of the
   hose interface to their normal states.  The mechanism can satisfy the
   demand that the client adjust bandwidth of hose interface dynamically
   to level up the network utility and to support bandwidth on demand
   (BoD) services Via L3 VPN.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST ", "MUST NOT ", "REQUIRED ", "SHALL ", "SHALL NOT
   ", "SHOULD ", "SHOULD NOT ", "RECOMMENDED ", "MAY ", and "OPTIONAL "
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminologies defined in RFC4031 [RFC4031],
   RFC2205 [RFC2205], RFC3209 [RFC3209], RFC4461 [RFC4461], and RFC4110
   [RFC4110].  The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology
   in [Extensions to P2MP RSVP-TE for Hose Model Provisioning in L3
   PPVPN].

   The NHSB, the Needed Hose Send Bandwidth, is needed bandwidth for CE
   to send data in the send buffer.

   The HSB, the Hose Send Bandwidth, is the biggest bandwidth for CE to
   send data.

   The IHSB, the Initiating Hose Send Bandwidth, is the smallest HSB of
   CE, and is fixed when the Hose VPN is established.

   The CHRB, the Current Hose Receive Bandwidth, is current speed of
   receive data stream for CE.

   The HRB, the Hose Receive Bandwidth, is the biggest bandwidth for CE
   to receive data.

   The IHRB, the Initiating Hose Receive Bandwidth, is the smallest HSB
   of CE, and is fixed when the Hose VPN is established.

   The threshold Bth, is the threshold of bandwidth adjusting.  If the
   value of difference is bigger than Bth, the state will increase or

   decrease the Hose Interface bandwidth.


3.  Hose Mode Overview

   In Hose VPN, a hose is used to connect the customers and its VPN
   network.  The customer does not have to specify the traffic matrix or
   the spread of this traffic to other customers like traditional VPN
   network, and it only needs to specify the performance characteristics
   of Hose Interface bandwidth.  The provider can ensure the hose
   interface performance in Hose VPN.


4.  CE Control Unit

   CE Control Unit is with CE, consisting of Sending Control Unit and
   Receiving Control Unit.CE Control Unit is used to control the up-and-
   down bandwidth of hose interface; send and receive message to adjust
   hose interface bandwidth; and detect data stream in the sending or
   receiving buffer.The architecture of CE Control Unit is illustrated
   in Figure 1.It includes one Sending Control Unit, one Receiving
   Control Unit and two buffers for data sending and data reception.

     Table 1: The meaning of Message Attribute for Bandwidth Query or
                              Control Message

   According to the difference of message attribute, the meaning of CE
   address and Bandwidth are different.

   Number of hose interface: 32 bits
       Indicates the number of CE needed to adjust hose bandwidth.

   CE Address and Bandwidth:
       Indicates the reference CE needed to adjust the corresponding
       hose bandwidth.For different Message Attribute, it has different
       meaning.

   o  On receiving the Bandwidth Query Message, a PE will look out the
      associated receiving PEs and receiving CEs, as well as Bandwidth
      to be increased.
   o  The PE will then compute the appropriated bandwidth network can
      provide.  The appropriated bandwidth is send to each CE in ACK of
      Bandwidth Query Message.
   o  On receiving the Bandwidth Increase Control Message, the PE will
      recompute the path bandwidth from the source PE to the destination
      PE according to the Bandwidth and CE Address in the message, so
      that the source PE will increase HSB and the destination PE will
      increase HRB.
   o  In ACK of Bandwidth Increase Control Message, the value of
      Bandwidth is the real bandwidth increased for each CE Address.
   o  When the message PE received is the Send Bandwidth Decrease
      Control Message, PE will decrease HSB.  After that, it will
      recompute the path bandwidth and adjust link to improve utility of
      network.
   o  In ACK of Send Bandwidth Decrease Control Message, the value of
      Bandwidth is the real bandwidth decreased.

   Bandwidth: 32 bits
       For different Message Attribute, it has different meaning.

   o  For Bandwidth Adjust Application Message, the destination CE is
      required to adjust the Bandwidth demanded by the source CE.
   o  The destination CE will compute the appropriate HRB, and return
      ACK of Bandwidth Adjust Application Message with the value of
      Bandwidth.


7.  Client Control Mode

   Hose VPN is configured with default configuration when established.
   With default state, HSB is equal to IHSB in Sending Control Unit and
   HRB is equal to IHRB in Receiving Control Unit.  When Hose VPN began
   to run, HSB may equal to or bigger than IHSB, and HRB may equal to or
   smaller than IHRB.

   In Sending Control Unit:

   1.  If the IHSB is smaller than or equal to HSB, the state will go
       into Send Timer Mode, or the state will continue judging
       conditions from step 2.
   2.  If the absolute value of NHSB subtracting HRB is smaller than
       threshold value Bth, the state will go into Send Timer Mode, or
       the state will continue judging conditions from step 3.
   3.  If NHSB is bigger than HSB, the state will go into Increase Send
       Bandwidth Control Mode, or the state will go into Decrease Send
       Bandwidth control Mode.
   4.  When the Send Timer Mode is end, the state will restart to judge
       conditions from step 1.

   In Receiving Control Unit:

   1.  If the state receives Bandwidth Adjust Application Message, it
       will go into Increase Receive Bandwidth control Mode, or it will
       go into Receive Timer Mode.
   2.  When the Receive Timer Mode is end, the state will continue
       judging conditions as follows.  If the value of HRB subtracting
       CHRB is smaller than Bth, the state will continue judge condition
       from step I, or it will continue judge conditions from step 3.
   3.  If HRB is bigger than IHRB, the state will go into Decrease
       Receive Bandwidth control Mode, or it will go into Receive Timer
       Mode.

7.1.  Timer Mode

   In Timer Mode, the state will compute time through a time counter.
   After a fixed interval of time, the Timer Mode will end
   automatically.

7.2.  Increase Send Bandwidth Control Mode

   In Increase Send Bandwidth Control Mode, the state will send
   Bandwidth Query Message to PE and then wait for ACK of Bandwidth
   Query Message.  If there is no bandwidth available in ACK of
   Bandwidth Query Message, the state will go into Send Timer Mode, or
   it will continue send Bandwidth Adjust Application Message and then
   wait for the ACK of Bandwidth Adjust Application Message.  At the
   same method, it there is no bandwidth available in ACK of Bandwidth
   Adjust Application Message, the state will go into Send Timer Mode,
   or it will send Bandwidth Increase Control Message, and then wait for
   ACK of Bandwidth Increase Control Message.  If it is failed in ACK of
   Bandwidth Increase Control Message, the state will go into Send Timer
   Mode, or it will increase local Hose Interface Send bandwidth and
   then go into Send Timer Mode.

7.3.  Decrease Send Bandwidth control Mode

   In Decrease Send Bandwidth control Mode, the state will decrease
   local Hose Interface Send bandwidth firstly, and then send Send
   Bandwidth Decrease Control Message and wait for ACK of Send Bandwidth
   Decrease Control Message.  After receive the ACK message, the state
   will go into the Send Timer Mode.

7.4.  Increase Receive Bandwidth control Mode

   After receive Bandwidth Adjust Application Message in Increase
   Receive Bandwidth control Mode, the state will judge whether the
   local machine can full the demand of source CE.  If Yes, the state
   will increase local Hose Interface Receive bandwidth and then reply
   ACK of Bandwidth Adjust Application Message; or No, the state will
   reply ACK message indirectly.  After replying ACK message, the state
   will go into Receive Timer Mode.

7.5.  Decrease Receive Bandwidth control Mode

   In Decrease Receive Bandwidth control Mode, the state will send
   Receive Bandwidth Decrease Control Message to PE and then wait for
   the ACK message.  After receive ACK of Receive Bandwidth Decrease
   Control Message, the state will decrease local Hose Interface Receive
   bandwidth and then the state will go into Receive Timer Mode.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   Since association of a particular port with a Hose VPN is done by the
   service provider as part of the service provisioning process, and
   since signaling between CE and PE is assumed to be over a private
   network, the solution described in this document doesn't require
   authentication in signaling.

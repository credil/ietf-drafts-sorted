  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extensions for Blocking VoIP Spam
                         Using PSTN Validation
             draft-rosenberg-dispatch-vipr-sip-antispam-03

Abstract

   Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a new technique
   for inter-domain federation of SIP calls.  ViPR makes use of the PSTN
   as an introduction mechanism to verify the correctness of mappings
   from phone numbers to domains.  The PSTN introduction mechanism can
   also be used as a technique for blocking spam - a SIP caller is only
   authorized when its calling domain has previously called that same
   number over the PSTN.  This document describes an extension to SIP
   which enables authorization of SIP calls based on a prior PSTN
   introduction.

Internet-Draft             ViPR SPAM Blocking               October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The anti-spam tickets described in this specification are the key
   security mechanism in ViPR for mitigation of SPAM.  The domain
   originating a call inserts a ticket in the SIP INVITE sent to the
   other domain.  The Border Element in the domain receiving the call
   (see Figure 1) can check the ticket to ensure that this originating
   domain has been authorized by the terminating domain.  This document
   relies heavily on the concepts and terminology defined in
   [VIPR-OVERVIEW] and will not make sense if you have not read that
   document first.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminating Side Procedures

   The Border Element will receive the TLS ClientHello which begins the
   TLS handshake.  The Border Element will present its own configured
   cert.  Once TLS handshaking is complete, the Border Element notes the
   domain from the SubjectAltName on the other side of the TLS
   connection, and associates it with that connection.

   Next, the Border Element will receive an INVITE.  This INVITE will
   contain a ticket in the X-Cisco-ViPR-Ticket header field value.  The
   Border Element extracts this header field.  This call flow assumes it
   is present.  The Border Element parses it, and obtains the epoch
   value encoded in the ticket.  This is matched against the current
   epoch value for the configured password.  If they match, processing
   continues.  The Border Element verifies the signature is correct.
   Next, it examines the start and stop time of the validity.  If the
   current time is between the start and stop times, the check is
   passed.  Next, the Border Element checks the granted-to domain in the
   ticket.  It compares that domain against the domain name in the
   SubjectAltName of the peer on the other side of the TLS connection,
   as noted above.  Next, it takes the Request-URI of the SIP INVITE.
   That will be of the form sip:+number@domain.  If it is not in that
   form, and if the number does not begin with a plus, the request is
   dropped.  The value, including the plus, is then compared to the
   number in the ticket.  If it is equal, the check has passed.  The
   Border Element leaves the header field in the request, but forwards
   to the Call Agent.

   In addition, the Border Element will typically be configured to apply
   its SIP message validation logic, and enforce restrictions on the
   sizes of various SIP header fields.  This provides an additional
   layer of security in case malicious SIP messages are sent.

   The Border Element will also apply port forwarding in the case of
   NAT, so that the incoming request is forwarded to the appropriate
   Call Agent node.

   The Call Agent will receive incoming SIP INVITEs.  The Request-URI of
   the INVITE will contain an E.164 number as indicated by a leading
   plus.  If the Request-URI is not an E.164, the request must be
   rejected with a 403.  Only E.164 numbers can be accepted on a ViPR

   trunk.


4.  Originating Side Procedures

   The routes stored to other domains in the Call Agent will each store
   a ticket to utilize with calls to that route.  The Call Agent learns
   about these routes and the information needed to construct the ticket
   from the VAP protocol [VIPR-VAP].  When sending a SIP request to one
   of these domains, the Call Agent MUST include the ticket in any
   dialog forming request or request that is not in an existing dialog.


5.  Tickets

   This ticket is a sequence of characters.  These MUST be placed into a
   X-Cisco-ViPR-Ticket SIP header field value.  Consequently the format
   for this header field is:
   Ticket = "X-Cisco-ViPR-Ticket" HCOLON ticket-val
   ticket-val = 1*(alphanum / "-" / "_" / ".")

   This header field MUST be utilized in all dialog forming requests and
   all out-of-dialog requests.  It is not utilized in responses.  The
   ticket-value is a modified base64 encoded version of an object that
   is composed of a series of TLVs.  Each TLV is a 16 bit type, a 16 bit
   length, and a variable length value.  The length field refers to the
   length of the value portion of the TLV, measured in bytes.  The
   following TLV types are defined:

   1.  Ticket Unique ID:  This TLV has a type of 0x0001.  It contains a
       128 bit ID that has a unique identifier for this ticket.  The
       value MUST contain a 128 bit UUID defined by [RFC4122].  This TLV
       MUST be present.  However at this time it is used for diagnostic
       purposes only.
   2.  Salt:  This TLV has a type of 0x0002.  It contains a value which
       MUST be at least 32 bits, and contains a random number.  Its
       presence ensures that each ticket contains sufficient randomness.
       This TLV MUST be present.
   3.  Validity:  This TLV has a type of 0x0003.  It contains two 64 bit
       NTP times.  The first is the start of the validity of the ticket,
       the next is the end time for the validity of the ticket.  This
       TLV MUST be present.
   4.  Number:  This TLV has a type of 0x0004.  It contains a string
       which has an E.164 number, included the "+", which may be called
       using this ticket.  The TLV has variable length.  This TLV MUST
       be present.

   5.  Granting Node:  This TLV has a type of 0x0005.  It contains a 128
       bit value which is the Node-ID of the node which granted the
       ticket.  This TLV MUST be present.
   6.  Granting Domain:  This TLV has a type of 0x0006.  The domain
       which granted the ticket.  A string, up to 256 characters, each
       of which must be a valid domain name character.  The TLV has
       variable length.  This TLV MUST be present.
   7.  Granted-To Domain:  This TLV has a type of 0x0007.  The domain to
       which the ticket is granted.  A string, up to 256 characters,
       each of which must be a valid domain name character.  The TLV has
       a variable length.  This TLV MUST be present.
   8.  Epoch:  This TLV has a type of 0x0008.  It contains a 32 bit
       epoch value.  It is used to select a key.  This TLV MUST be
       present.
   9.  Integrity:  This TLV has a type of 0x0009.  It contains a 160 bit
       integrity value, computed using HMAC-SHA1.  This TLV MUST be
       present and MUST be the last TLV in the object.

   The base64 encoding uses the base64url encoding from RFC4648
   [RFC4648], with the exception of the pad character, which is a "."
   instead of an "=".  This ensures that the output is a valid SIP
   token.

   To compute the MAC, the following is done.  First, the key is
   obtained.  The key is actually a 128 bit key, configured into the
   system.  The key, P, is then used to compute Km:

   Km = HMAC-SHA1(P, S | Epoch)

   Based on PBKDF2 from PKCS #5 [RFC2898] with HMAC-SHA1 as PRF and
   iteration count of 1.  Where S is the 32 bit salt and Epoch is the 32
   bit Epoch, from the ticket.  This produces a 160 bit Km.  The MAC is
   then computed as another HMAC-SHA1, over the entire ticket up to but
   not including the Integrity itself, using Km as the key.  This
   produces the 160 bit MAC.


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD


7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD - Register SIP Header

   TBD - Form IANA registry for Ticket TLVs

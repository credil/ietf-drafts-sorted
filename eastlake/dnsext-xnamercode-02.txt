               <draft-eastlake-dnsext-xnamercode-02.txt>


Abstract

   The Domain Name System (DNS) has long provided means, such as CNAME
   (Canonical Name), where a query can be redirected to a different
   name. A DNS response header has an RCODE (Response Code) field, used
   for indicating errors, and response status bits. This document
   clarifies, in the case of such redirected queries, how the RCODE and
   status bits correspond to the initial query cycle (where the CNAME or
   the like was detected) and subsequent or final query cycles.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                 xNAME RCODE Clarification


1. Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) has long provided means, such as the
   CNAME (Canonical Name [RFC1035]) and DNAME [RFC2672] RRs (Resource
   Records), whereby a DNS query can be redirected to a different name.
   In particular, CNAME normally causes a query to its owner name to be
   redirected while DNAME normally causes a query to any lower level
   name to be redirected. There has been a proposal for another
   redirection RR. In addition, as specified in [RFC2672], redirection
   through a DNAME also results in the synthesis of a CNAME RR in the
   response. In this document, we will refer to all RRs causing such
   redirection as xNAME RRs.

   xNAME RRs can be explicitly retrieved by querying for the xNAME type.
   When a different type is queried and an xNAME RR is encountered, the
   xNAME RR (and possibly a synthesized CNAME) is added to the answer of
   the response, DNSSEC RRs applicable to the xNAME RR may be added to
   the response, and the query is restarted with the name to which it
   was redirected.

   An xNAME may redirect a query to a name at which there is another
   xNAME and so on. In this document, we use "xNAME chain" to refer to a
   series of one or more xNAMEs each of which refers to another xNAME
   except the last, which refers to a non-xNAME or results in an error.

   A DNS response header has an RCODE (Response Code) field, used for
   indicating errors, and status bits that indicate whether an answer is
   authoritative and/or authentic. This document clarifies, in the case
   of such redirected queries, how the RCODE and status bits correspond
   to the initial query cycle (where the (first) xNAME was detected) and
   subsequent or final query cycles.

2. Status Bits

   There are two status bits returned in query responses for which a
   question could arise as to how, in the case of an xNAME chain, they
   relate to the first, possible intermediate, and/or last queries, as
   follows:



2.1 The Authoritative Answer Bit

   The AA, or Authoritative Answer bit, in the DNS response header
   indicates that the answer returned is from a DNS server authoritative
   for the zone containing that answer. For an xNAME chain, this
   "authoritative" status could be different for each answer in that
   chain.

   [RFC1035] unambiguously states that the AA bit is to be set based on
   whether the server providing the answer with the first owner name in
   the answer section is authoritative.  This specification of the AA
   bit has not been changed.



2.2 The Authentic Data Bit

   The AD, or Authentic Data bit, indicates that the response returned
   is authentic according to the dictates of DNSSEC [RFC4035]. [RFC4035]
   unambiguously states that the AD bit is to be set in a DNS response
   header only if the DNSSEC enabled server believes all RRs in the
   answer and authority sections of that response to be authentic.  This
   specification of the AD bit has not been changed.

3. RCODE Clarification

   The RCODE (Response Code) field in a DNS query response header is
   non-zero to indicate an error. Section 4.3.2 of [RFC1034] has a
   resolution algorithm that includes CNAME processing but has been
   found to be unclear concerning the ultimate setting of RCODE in the
   case of such redirection. Section 2.1 of [RFC2308] implies that the
   RCODE should be set based on the last query cycle in the case of an
   xNAME chain but Section 2.2.1 of [RFC2308] says that some servers
   don't do that!

   When there is an xNAME chain, the RCODE field is set as follows:



3.A [Alternative A]

   As with the AA bit, the RCODE MUST BE set based on the initial lookup
   of the QNAME in the original DNS query. This means that, if this
   initial lookup succeeds in finding an xNAME RR, which is then
   inserted as the first RR in the answer section, necessarily the RCODE
   in the ultimate DNS response will be zero, indicating no error.



3.B [Alternative B]

   When an xNAME chain is followed, all but the last query cycle
   necessarily had no error. The RCODE in the ultimate DNS response MUST
   BE set based on the final query cycle leading to that response. If
   the xNAME chain was terminated by an error, it will be that error
   code. If the xNAME chain terminated without error, it will be zero.

4. Security Considerations

   The AA header flag bit is not protected by DNSSEC [RFC4033]. To
   secure it, secure communications are needed between the querying
   resolver and the DNS server. Such security can be provided by DNS
   transaction security, either TSIG [RFC2845] or SIG(0) [RFC2931].

   An AD header flag bit and the RCODE in a response are not, in
   general, protected by DNSSEC, so the same conditions as stated in the
   previous paragraph generally apply to them; however, this is not
   always true. In particular, if the following apply, then the AD bit
   or an NXDOMAIN RCODE are protected by DNSSEC in the sense that the
   querier can calculate whether they are correct:
   1. The zone where an NXDOMAIN RCODE occurs or all the zones where the
      data whose authenticity would be indicated by the AD flag bit are
      signed zones.
   2. The query or queries involved indicate that DNSSEC RRs are OK in
      responses.
   3. The responses providing these indications are from servers that
      include the additional DNSSEC RRs required by DNSSEC.
   4. The querier has appropriate trust anchor(s) and appropriately
      validates and processes the DNSSEC RRs in the response.

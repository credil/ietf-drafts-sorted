Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS             January 2011 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   Cloud data center requires such a large layer 2 network that SHOULD 
   not only be able to support shortest path forwarding and Equal Cost 
   Multi-Path (ECMP) forwarding for maximizing the bandwidth capacity 
   between servers, but also be able to provide a huge amount of VPN 
   instances for isolating tens or even hundreds of thousands of 
   tenements within the cloud data centers. VPLS seems as a good option 
   for such scenario. However, both BGP VPLS [RFC4761] and LDP VPLS 
   [RFC4762] are not much acceptable for most data center operators 
   since they are a bit heavy-weight.  

   Hence, this document describes a light-weight VPLS solution using 
   IS-IS [IS-IS][RFC1195] which is intended for the specific data 
   center network scenario as mentioned above. On the control plane, 
   IS-IS is run between P and PE routers, and an extended IS-IS TLV is 
   used by PE routers to distribute their own VPLS membership 
   information including the attached VPLS instances and their 
   associated VPLS labels among each other. On the data plane, the VPLS 
   label is carried in the inner MPLS header of L2VPN data packets 
   (e.g., MAC-in-MPLS-in-IP). Note that the VPLS label (i.e., the MPLS 
   label) here is just used to identify a particular VPLS instance, but 
   not to identify both a particular VPLS instance and a particular 
   ingress PE router as the PW label does.  

   With IS-IS based VPLS, the network operators only need to run a 
   single routing protocol (i.e., IS-IS) on the backbone of their data 
   center networks, rather than to run separate BGP and/or LDP for VPLS 
   while running IGP (e.g., IS-IS) for the routing protocol between PE 
   routers.  

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4664], [VPLS-MCAST], 
   [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].  

3. Assumption 

   In IS-IS VPLS, IP based tunnel is the default choice for the PE-to-
   PE tunnel technology. In the sparse case where MPLS traffic-
   engineering is desired, ISIS-TE [RFC5305] and RSVP-TE [RFC3209] 
   could be seamlessly enabled on the basis of IS-IS VPLS. Note that 
   the LDP based MP2P LSP tunnel MUST NOT be used as the PE-to-PE 
   tunnel in IS-IS VPLS due to the fact that the egress PE router would 
   not be able to perform the MAC learning correctly without the

   knowledge of the ingress PE router of the L2VPN data packet received 
   from the backbone. 

   4. Control Plane 

   There are two primary functions of the VPLS control plane: auto-
   discovery and signaling. In IS-IS VPLS, both of these functions are 
   accomplished with a single IS-IS TLV advertisement.

    |Type=VPLS  | (8 bits)

    |Length     | (8 bits)

           This 128-bit field is filled with one of the PE router's IP 
           addresses which are reachable across the backbone. The 
           address filled in this field SHOULD be used as tunnel 
           destination addresses by remote PE routers when sending a CE 
           packet to such PE router. If the IP address is IPv4, the 
           last four octets of this field are filled with the IPv4

           address while the remaining part is set to zero. In other 
           words, it is filled with an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. 

       VPLS_ID  

           This field is filled with a 20-bit globally unique VPLS ID 
           for a particular attached VPLS instance.  

       VPLS Label 

           This field is filled with a 20-bit MPLS label corresponding 
           to the VPLS instance which is identified by the VPLS ID.  

   4.2. Auto-Discovery 

   In IS-IS VPLS, each PE router could automatically discover which 
   other PE routers are part of a given VPLS instance identified by the 
   globally unique VPLS ID. This allows each PE router's configuration 
   to consist only of the identity of the VPLS instance established on 
   this PE router, not the identity of every other PE router in that 
   VPLS instance. 

   4.3. Signaling 

   In IS-IS VPLS, it is REQUIRED that a PE router SHOULD assign the 
   same MPLS label for a given VPLS instance to any other PE router. In 
   other words, this VPLS label is used for identifying a particular 
   VPLS instance, rather than for identifying both a particular VPLS 
   instance and the corresponding ingress PE router as the PW label 
   does. 

   The VPLS label in IS-IS VPLS just needs to be locally unique, rather 
   than globally unique for most cases except the aggregate P-Multicast 
   tree based VPLS multicast case where a single P-Multicast tree is 
   shared by more than one VPLS instance.  

   For example, in unicast and ingress-replication multicast cases 
   [VPLS-MCAST], it is no necessary for the VPLS label to be globally 
   unique. Besides, in the non-aggregative P-Multicast tree [VPLS-MCAST] 
   based VPLS multicast case where a single P-Multicast tree is 
   exclusively used by no more than one VPLS instance, the MAC-in-IP 
   encapsulation is used since the multicast address itself in the IP 
   based tunnel header is enough for identifying a particular VPLS 
   instance. Therefore, it doesn't require the VPLS label to be 
   globally unique either.

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS             January 2011 
 
   For the aggregate P-Multicast tree [VPLS-MCAST] based VPLS multicast, 
   the VPLS label for a given VPLS instance directly equals the VPLS ID 
   of that VPLS instance. If the globally unique label assignment can 
   not be met in some cases, such multicast mode SHOULD be prohibited.  

   5. Data Plane 

   5.1. Data Encapsulation 

    5.1.1. Unicast 

   MAC-in-MPLS-in-IP encapsulation [RFC4448][RFC4023] SHOULD be used 
   for unicast. The IP here means any of IP based encapsulations, such 
   as MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation).   

   For unknown destination unicast, the encapsulation is the same as 
   that for multicast/broadcast described in the following section. 

    5.1.2. Multicast/Broadcast  

   There are two major multicast modes for IS-IS VPLS: ingress 
   replication mode and P-Multicast tree mode. 

   The encapsulation corresponding to each mode is described in the 
   following sub-sections. 

    5.1.2.1. Ingress Replication Mode 

   In the ingress replication mode, an ingress PE router forward the CE 
   multicast/broadcast frames received via its attachment circuits 
   towards each remote PE router of the same VPLS instance in the 
   separate IP based tunnels destined for each remote PE router. Hence, 
   the encapsulation in this mode has no difference from that for 
   unicast. 

    5.1.2.2. P-Multicast Tree Mode 

   In the non-aggregative P-Multicast tree mode where a single P-
   Multicast distribution tree in the backbone is exclusively used by 
   one VPLS instance, the MAC-in-IP encapsulation is used directly 
   since the destination IP address (i.e., multicast address) contained 
   in the IP-based tunnel header is enough for the egress PE routers to 
   determine which VPLS instance the encapsulated CE packets received 
   from a remote PE router belongs to. 

   For aggregative P-Multicast tree mode in which a single P-Multicast 
   tree is shared by more than one VPLS instance, MAC-in-MPLS-IP

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS             January 2011 
 
   encapsulation SHOULD be used. The MPLS label contained in the inner 
   MPLS header would be used by the egress PE routers to identify the 
   particular VPLS instance that the received CE data packets belong to. 

   5.2. Data Forwarding 

   In IS-IS VPLS, there is almost no difference from BGP VPLS and LDP 
   VPLS from the aspect of data forwarding. 

   5.3. MAC Address Learning 

   Like BGP VPLS and LDP VPLS, data driven MAC learning is available in 
   IS-IS VPLS. Upon receiving an encapsulated CE data packet from a 
   remote PE router, the MPLS label contained in the MPLS header of the 
   data packet is used to identify the particular VPLS instance that 
   the data packet belongs to, while the source IP address contained in 
   the IP based tunnel header is used to tell from which ingress PE 
   router the data packet is sent.  

   If the CE MAC reachability information is desired to be distributed 
   across PE routers on the control plane, such information SHOULD be 
   fully transparent to P routers as if the packets containing that 
   information were encapsulated CE data packets. Besides, the CE MAC 
   reachability information of a given VPPLS instance SHOULD be 
   distributed only to those PE routers of that VPLS instance. Details 
   about how to advertise the CE MAC reachability information on the 
   control plane is for further study. 

6. Summary 

   The major side-effect of using IGP to distribute the VPLS membership 
   information is the VPLS membership information would have to be 
   exposed to P routers unnecessarily. Fortunately, the extended IS-IS 
   TLV for VPLS is partially transparent to P routers, that is to say, 
   P routers don't need to process the VPLS membership information 
   contained in that IS-IS TLV, but only need to synchronize the Link 
   State PDUs (LSP) with their IS-IS neighbors. Anyway, this ought to 
   be a necessary and affordable cost of achieving the configuration 
   simplicity.  

7. Security Considerations 

   This document adds no additional security risks to IS-IS and VPLS. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   There is no requirement for IANA.

Internet-Draft      Loops Avoidance for BGP Best External     July 2010 
 
    
1. Problem Statement 

   According to the base BGP specifications, a BGP speaker can not 
   advertise any route other than the best route for a given 
   destination  which largely hampers the fast convergence of BGP route. 
   To improve the BGP convergence performance, the best external route 
   approach [BEST-EXTERNAL] is proposed, which allows a BGP speaker to 
   advertise the second-best route for a given destination which can be 
   used by its BGP peers as a standby route immediately after the best 
   route fails. However, due to the time routers take for propagating 
   the topology change around the network together with the difference 
   in time taken by routers to update their FIBs for the affected 
   destinations, transient forwarding loops will usually occur during 
   this transition process.

                     Figure 1: Best External Use Case 

   In the above scenario shown in Figure 1, BGP best external approach 
   is enabled on the BGP speakers of AS#1 (i.e., R1, R2 and R3), 
   assuming R1 and R2 each learns an eBGP route to the same destination 
   P from AS#2 and AS#3 respectively, and the route learnt from AS#2 is 
   selected as the best route by R1, R2 and R3. According to the best 
   external approach, R2 will advertise its best external route to P 
   (i.e., the route learnt from AS#3) to its iBGP peers, R1 and R3. 
   When R1's connection to AS#2 is broken, a transient forwarding loop 
   will be formed till the best route to P for R2 has converged to an 
   alternate path (i.e., the route learnt from AS#3). That is: R3 still 
   forward packets destined for P towards R1 which, in turn, will 
   forward them to R2 due to its fast local repair process. Upon 
   receiving those packets, R2 will still forward them back to R1 since 
   the route learnt from its iBGP peer R1 (i.e., the route learnt from

   AS#2) is still deemed as the best route to P... Thus, a transient 
   forwarding loop is formed between R1 and R2 till the network is 
   converged.  

   Somebody may argue that in the above scenario, by using IGP within 
   AS#1 for fast flooding of AS#2's ASBR next-hop down event, together 
   with the Prefix Independent Convergence (PIC) core technology, the 
   BGP convergence can be completed in a very short period. Therefore, 
   there is absolutely no need to avoid such transient forwarding loop 
   any more. However, besides the hardware requirement for PIC 
   capability, such network design also requires that the BGP next-hop 
   of the eBGP-learnt routes should not be changed when being 
   advertised to iBGP peers. Unfortunately, there does exist some 
   scenarios where the BGP next-hop of the eBGP-learnt routes MUST be 
   rewritten by a BGP speaker as itself when advertising these routes 
   to its iBGP peers. BGP/MPLS VPN [RFC4364] and Softwire Mesh [RFC5565] 
   are two common examples.

   Taken the BGP/MPLS VPN Customer Edge (CE) multi-homing as an example 
   (See Figure 2), assuming PE1 and PE2 each learns a route to the same 
   destination P from CE1 and CE2 respectively, and the route learnt 
   from CE1 is selected as the best route by PE1, PE2 and PE3. Once the 
   link between PE1 and CE1 fails, due to fast local repair process, 
   PE1 will immediately reroute the packets destined for P to PE2 which, 
   in turn, forwards the packets back to PE1 since the routes on PE2 
   have not been converged. Thus the transient loop is formed. 

2. Transient Loop Avoidance Mechanism 

   The transient loop scenario demonstrated in Figure 1 can be avoided 
   as long as the best external route is processed according to the 
   approaches defined in Carrying Label Information in BGP-4 [RFC3107]. 
   For example, R2 will assign a unique MPLS label for its best 
   external route (i.e., the route to P learnt from AS#3) and then 
   install it into its MPLS forwarding table. When advertising the best 
   external route to its iBGP peers, R2 will attach the corresponding 
   MPLS label in the BGP update. Upon receiving the best external route, 
   R1 and R3 could either process it as normal BGP behavior or install 
   it into their own forwarding table as a backup route to destination 
   P.  In case that the best route becomes unavailable (e.g., R1's 
   connection to AS#2 is lost), R1 will immediately reroute the packets 
   destined for P towards R2 with the corresponding MPLS label attached, 
   according to the standby route advertised by R2. R2 in turn will 
   forward the received packets to AS#3 according to the corresponding 
   MPLS forwarding entry (i.e., its best external route to P), rather 
   than the route entry in its routing table (i.e., its best route to 
   P). Of course, if R1 and R2 are not directly connected, an IP or 
   MPLS tunnel from R1 to R2 is required since the above MPLS label has 
   only local meaning on R2. 

   Similarly, for the transient loop scenario described in Figure 2, 
   the PE2 should assign a unique label for the standby route (i.e., 
   best external route) to P which is different from the label (either 
   per-VPN label or per-route label) for the best route to P, and then 
   install this standby route into its MPLS forwarding table. Upon 
   receiving packets with inner MPLS label (i.e., VPN label) matching 
   the label of the standby route to P, PE2 will forward the packets 
   directly to CE2, other than to PE1, according to the matching MPLS 
   forwarding table entry. Thus the transient loop will not occur any 
   more in this case.  

3. Security Considerations 

   No additional security risk is introduced by using this loop 
   prevention mechanism.

   No requirement for IANA.

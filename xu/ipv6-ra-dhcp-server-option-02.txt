       IPv6 Router Advertisement Option for Stateless DHCP Server
                 draft-xu-ipv6-ra-dhcp-server-option-02

Abstract

   This document proposes a Router Advertisement option which consists
   of the addresses of stateless DHCP servers.  After obtaining the
   addresses, IPv6 hosts can directly contact stateless DHCP servers
   using unicast.

Internet-Draft       RA Option for Stateless DHCPv6         January 2011


1.  Terminologies

   This document uses the terminology defined in Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration[RFC2460], DHCPv6 specification[RFC3315] and
   Stateless DHCP[RFC3736].


2.  Introduction

   After obtaining IPv6 addresses through Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration [RFC2462] or manual configuration, an IPv6 host can
   also use stateless DHCP[RFC3736] to collect other configuration
   information (e.g., DNS recursive name servers) in the network.
   According to [RFC3736], the host needs to send an Information-Request
   message to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.
   After receiving the Information-Request message, a DHCP server then
   respond with a Reply message containing the desired configuration
   information.  If the host and the DHCP server are located different
   broadcast domains, such communication need to be relayed by pre-
   deployed DHCP Relay Agents.

   If a host can obtain the address of a stateless DHCP server from
   someplace in advance, it is able to send Information-Request messages
   to the DHCP server directly.  As a consequence, the latencies imposed
   by relay agents can be eliminated; the conditions where the host
   receives redundant responses from multiple DHCP servers can also be
   avoided.  Moreover, unicast messages are more difficult to intercept
   than multicast messages.  Therefore, if a client uses unicast to
   contact DHCP servers, the security issues caused by rogue DHCP server
   can be mitigated to some extent.

   The document introduces a new Router Advertisement option called the
   Stateless DHCP Server option which contains the IP addresses of
   stateless DHCP servers.  After obtaining the address of a stateless
   DHCP server from a Stateless DHCP Server option, a client can use
   unicast to directly communicate with the server.


3.  RA Option for Stateless DHCP Server

   A Stateless DHCP Server option contains at least one stateless DHCP
   server address.  If there are multiple addresses, all of them share a
   same lifetime value.  If different lifetime values are desired, the
   IP addresses can be encapsulated within different options.  Figure 1
   shows the format of the Stateless DHCP Server option.

   Fields:

   Type      D28-bit identifier of the Stateless DHCP Server option type
             to be assigned by the IANA;
   Length    8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option
             (including the Type and Length fields) is in units of 8
             octets.  The minimum value is 3 if one IPv6 address is
             contained in the option.  Every additional DHCP Server
             address increases the length by 2.  The Length field is
             used by the receiver to determine the number of IPv6
             addresses in the option.
   Lifetime  32-bit unsigned integer.  The maximum time, in seconds
             (relative to the time the packet is sent), over which this
             DHCP Server address MAY be used for obtaining configuration
             information.  Hosts MAY send a Router Solicitation to
             guarantee the freshness of the DHCP Sever information
             before the interval expires.
   Addresses One or more 128-bit IPv6 addresses of the stateless DHCP
   of        servers.  The number of the addresses can be derived from
   Stateless the value of the Length field.  Specifically, the number of
   DHCP      addresses is equal to (Length - 1) / 2.

4.  DHCPv6 Extensions

   After obtaining the address of a DHCP server from the Stateless DHCP
   Server option, a client COULD send an information-Request message
   directly to the DHCP server via unicast.

   In [RFC3315], we found the following statement: "A server MUST
   discard any Solicit, Confirm, Rebind or Information-request messages

   it receives with a unicast destination address."  We believe that the
   designers of DHCPv6 assumed that clients have no knowledge about the
   IP addresses of DHCP servers at the time they send Information-
   request messages.  Therefore, if a DHCP server receives an
   Information-request message with a unicast destination address, it
   will regard it as an abnormal message.  However, in the scenarios
   where clients can get the IP addresses of DHCP servers from someplace
   else, this assumption is invalid anymore.  Therefore, we argue that a
   stateless DHCP server should accept an Information- request messages
   it receives with a unicast destination address.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA should assign an IPV6 Neighbor Discovery option for the
   Option defined in this document in the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   Option Formats" registry.


6.  Security Considerations

   In practice, DHCP relay agents can be used to slower or damp the
   frequency of attacks on the DHCP servers.  However, when using our
   solution, attackers can get the IP addresses of DHCPv6 servers in
   advance, and so they can bypass replay agents and send flooding
   traffic to DHCPv6 servers directly.  Regarding this issue, we argue
   that since the stateless DHCP server doesn't need to maintain any
   dynamic state for individual clients, this kind of flooding attack on
   the DHCP Servers will not be worse than the attacks on DNS servers.

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture            August, 2010 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

1. Introduction 

   The Default Free Zone (DFZ) routing table size has been growing at an 
   increasing and potentially alarming rate for several years, which has 
   detrimental impact on the routing system scalability and the routing 
   convergence performance. This so-called routing scalability issue has 
   drawn significant attention from both industry and academia. After 
   much discussion following the IAB Routing and Addressing workshop 
   [RAWS] in Amsterdam, a common conclusion was reached that the 
   explosive growth in the DFZ routing table is mainly caused by the 
   wide adoption of multi-homing, traffic engineering and provider-
   independent address. However, the underlying reason for this issue is 
   the overloading of IP address semantics of both identifiers and 
   locators. This overloading makes it impossible to renumber IP 
   addresses in a topologically aggregatable way.  

   At present, the IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) is chartered to 
   explore a new routing and addressing architecture which is expected 
   to support the multi-homing, traffic-engineering, mobility and 
   simplified renumbering features in a more scalable way.  

   This document describes a new ID/locator split architecture, called 
   Routing Architecture for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI), which 
   aims to deal with the above issues. Similar with Host Identity 
   Protocol (HIP) [RFC4423], RANGI also introduces a host identifier (ID) 
   layer between the IPv6 network layer and the transport layer. As a 
   result, the transport-layer associations (e.g., TCP connections) are 
   no longer bound to IP addresses, but to the host IDs. Unlike HIP, 
   RANGI adopts hierarchical and cryptographic host IDs which have 
   delegation-oriented structure. As a result, the corresponding ID-
   >locator mapping system for such identifiers has a reasonable 
   business model and clear trust boundaries. In addition, RANGI uses 
   special IPv4-embeded IPv6 addresses as locators. With such locators, 
   site-controlled traffic-engineering and simplified renumbering can be 
   easily achieved, meanwhile, the deployment cost of this new 
   architecture is reduced greatly. 

2. Architecture Description 

   2.1. Host Identifiers 

   In RANGI, host IDs are hierarchical and 128-bit long. As depicted in 
   Figure 1, a host ID consists of two parts: the leftmost n bits (Note 
   that the suitable value of "n" has not been determined yet, while the 
   value of " n" is set to 64 in our current prototype) part is the 
   Administrative Domain (AD) ID which has embedded organizational

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture            August, 2010

   affiliation and global uniqueness, and the remaining part (i.e., the 
   rightmost 128-n bits)is the Local Host ID which is generated by 
   computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key of 
   the ID owner and auxiliary parameters, e.g., the ID owner's AD ID. 
   The binding between the public key and the host ID can be verified by 
   re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with the host 
   ID. As these identifiers are expected to be used along with IPv6 
   addresses at both applications and APIs, especially in the RANGI 
   transition mechanisms defined in [RANGI-PROXY], it is desired to 
   explicitly distinguish host IDs from IPv6 addresses (i.e., locators) 
   and vice versa. Hence, a separate prefix for identifiers SHOULD be 
   allocated by the IANA. As a result, several leftmost bits in the AD 
   ID field SHOULD be reserved to fill this dedicated prefix.

                    Figure 1. Host Identifier Structure 
                                      
   The approach of generating hierarchical RANGI host IDs is similar to 
   that for Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972]. The 
   major difference is that the prefix of the RANGI host ID is AD ID, 
   rather than ordinary IPv6 address prefix. In CGA, the process of 
   generating a new address takes three input values: a 64-bit subnet 
   prefix, the public key of the address owner as a DER-encoded ASN.1 
   structure of the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo and the security parameter 
   Sec, which is an unsigned three-bit integer. In contrast, the process 
   of generating a hierarchical host ID in RANGI also takes three input 
   values: the n-bit AD ID, the public key of the host ID owner and the 
   security parameter Sec. Therefore, if we set the value of n to 64, 
   the process of generating RANGI host IDs can be compatible with that 
   for CGA. 
    
   The benefits of using hierarchical host IDs in RANGI include but not 
   limited to: 1) manage the global identifier namespace in a scalable 
   way; 2) hold a reasonable economic model and clear trust boundaries

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture            August, 2010 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   in the corresponding ID->Locator mapping system; 3) ease the 
   transition from the current Internet to RANGI.  
    
   In RANGI, the global uniqueness of host IDs is guaranteed through 
   some registration mechanism. Since the AD IDs are globally unique and 
   owned by the corresponding host ID registration and administrative 
   authorities of different countries respectively, the Local Host IDs 
   are only REQUIRED to be unique within the corresponding AD scope. 
    
   The resolution infrastructure for flat labels has no "pay-for-your-
   own" model, as names are stored at essentially random nodes (See 
   Layered Naming Architecture (LNA) [LNA]). In contrast, the resolution 
   infrastructure for hierarchical host IDs in RANGI has reasonable 
   business model and clear trust boundaries since host IDs can be 
   stored in the corresponding authoritative servers according to their 
   organizational structures. To some extent, the business model of the 
   ID->Locator mapping system in RANGI is similar to that for the Domain 
   Name Service (DNS). 

   In the RANGI transition mechanisms described in [RANGI-PROXY], the 
   identifiers of RANGI hosts are treated as ordinary IPv6 addresses by 
   legacy IPv6 hosts. Upon receives a packet with the destination 
   address being a host ID, the router SHOULD forward the packet 
   according to the destination IPv6 address as normal. In the end, the 
   packet will be forwarded to a dedicated proxy that is responsible for 
   translating the packets between RANGI and IPv6. Since the identifiers 
   are hierarchical and delegation-oriented aggregatable, such 
   identifier-based routing during transition period will not cause any 
   routing scalability issue. For more details, please refer to [RANGI-
   PROXY]. 

   2.2. Host Locators 

   The host locators in RANGI are ordinary IPv6 addresses. Since the 
   IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition will last for a long period, in 
   order to reduce the deployment cost of this new routing and 
   addressing architecture, RANGI uses specific IPv4-embeded IPv6 
   addresses as locators. As shown in Figure 2, the leftmost 96-bit part 
   of a locator is called Locator Domain Identifier (LD ID), while the 
   rightmost 32-bit part is filled with an IPv4 address which is 
   REQUIRED to be unique within the scope of corresponding LD. LD IDs 
   are used to globally identify each site network which is allowed to 
   adopt independent IPv4 address space (either public or private IPv4 
   addresses). Actually, LD IDs are Provider-Assigned (PA) /96 IPv6 
   prefixes which are topologically aggregatable in provider networks.

   Similar with the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol 
   (ISATAP) [RFC5214], this specific locator can be used for 
   automatically tunneling IPv6 packets over IPv4 site networks.  
 
   2.3. Packet Formats 

   RANGI reuse the IPv6 packet format to maximum extent. The host IDs 
   are filled as options in the Destination Option Header, whereas the 
   locators are filled as IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 header. Packets 
   sent from a RANGI host can be protected by attaching the public key 
   and auxiliary parameters and by signing the packets with the 
   corresponding private key. The protection works without a 
   certification authority or any security infrastructure.  

   The details about the packet format and how to use IPsec to carry the 
   data traffic will be described in the latter version of this draft or 
   in a separate draft.   

   2.4. ID->Locator Mapping Resolution 

   ID/locator split implies a need for storing and distributing the 
   mappings from host IDs to locators. 

   In RANGI, the mappings from Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to 
   host IDs are stored in the DNS system, while the mappings from host 
   IDs to locators are stored in a distributed ID->Locator mapping 
   system which can be built on the current DNS infrastrature. In a DNS 
   based ID->Locator mapping system, if there are too many entries to be 
   maintained by the authoritative servers of a given Administrative 
   Domain (AD), Distribute Hash Table (DHT) technology can be used 
   further to make these authoritative servers scale better. That is to 
   say, the mappings maintained by a given AD will be distributed among 
   a group of authoritative servers in a DHT fashion. As a result, the 
   robustness feature of DHT is inherited naturally into the ID->Locator 
   mapping system. Meanwhile, there is no trust issue since each AD 
   authority runs its own DHT ring which maintains only mappings for the 
   identifiers belonging to this AD.

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture            August, 2010 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   A detailed mapping lookup example is given as follows: 

   1. A host ID will be transformed to a FQDN format string. Firstly, a 
   host ID is expressed as "country-code.authority-code.region-
   code.local-host-ID" by inserting dots between adjacent fields, then 
   by reversing the fields and attaching with the suffix "rangiid.arpa." 
   it is transformed into a FQDN-format string as "local-host-ID.region-
   code.authority-code.country-code.rangiid.arpa." 

   2. The FQDN-format string is used as a key to locate the 
   authoritative DNS server which maintains the desired resource records. 

   In order to facilitate such a lookup process, a new sub-domain " 
   rangiid.arpa." needs to be inserted into the current domain name 
   hierarchy. This sub-domain can delegate its own sub-domains according 
   to the hierarchy of the FQDN-format string of the host ID. A new 
   Resource Record (RR) named RANGI is also defined for the ID->Locator 
   mappings, in which the NAME field is filled with the FQDN-format 
   string of a host ID, while the RDATA field is filled with the 
   corresponding locator information, including but not limited to an 
   IPv6 address (i.e., locator) and its preference, and so on.  

   The resolution infrastructure for flat names has no "pay-for-your-
   own" model, as the flat names are stored at essentially random nodes. 
   In contrast, the resolution infrastructure for hierarchical host IDs, 
   as used in RANGI, has reasonable business and trust models because 
   hierarchical host IDs have clear organization affiliation. 

   To prevent the Man-in-the-Middle attacks during mapping lookups, the 
   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC535] is strongly recommended for 
   the origin authentication and integrity assurance of the DNS data. 

   To prevent DNS recursive servers caching antique ID->Locator mapping 
   information, the TTL of a RANGI RR for a mobile host SHOULD be set to 
   0 or a very small value. However, if a host (i.e., Correspondence 
   Node) wants to cache the RR of the communicating host (i.e., Mobile 
   Node), it can reset the TTL of that RR to a reasonable value 
   internally. 

   The Secure DNS Dynamic Update mechanism defined in [RFC3007] is 
   directly used for dynamically updating the ID->Locator mapping 
   entries in the ID->Locator mapping system in a secure way.

                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   2.5. Routing and Forwarding System 

   In RANGI, site networks (i.e., LDs) are connected to the IPv6 
   Internet via site border routers called Locator Domain Border Routers 
   (LDBRs). LDBRd play the similar role as ISATAP [RFC5214] routers. 

   A simple RANGI routing procedure is illustrated in Figure 3. Host A 
   (as source host) looks up the locator of host B (as destination host) 
   through the ID->Locator mapping system before communicating with host 
   B. Since these two hosts are located in different LDs, A will tunnel 
   the packets destined for B to one of its local LDBRs, e.g., BR1. 
   Otherwise, A will tunnel the packets destined for B directly towards 
   B's IPv4 address. Once the packets arrive at the LDBR of the 
   destination site, e.g., BR4, it will tunnel the IPv6 packets towards 
   B's IPv4 address which is the last four octets of the destination 
   locator.

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture            August, 2010 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   LDBRs are dual-stack routers which could be able to perform source-
   based policy routing and source address rewriting according to 
   traffic-engineering policies on the outgoing packets. 

   Hosts can get the IPv4 addresses of their local LDBRs in several ways, 
   e.g., a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option, or a 
   site-scope well-known anycast address dedicated for LDBRs.  

   In RANGI, IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels are deployed in the site networks. 
   Hence, RANGI can achieve a smooth IPv4/IPv6 transition in the scope 
   of site networks. 

   2.6. Site Multi-homing and Traffic-Engineering 

   In RANGI, each multi-homed site shall be assigned a /96 IPv6 prefix 
   from each upstream ISP. Each host inside the multi-homed site, in 
   turn, has multiple locators by concatenating the provider-assigned 
   /96 IPv6 prefix with its locally unique IPv4 address. Hosts register 
   the mappings from their identifiers to locators on the ID->Locator 
   mapping system. As shown in Figure 4, host A is a RANGI host inside a 
   multi-homed site, and it has two locators which are respectively 
   synthesized from the LD IDs delegated from ISP1 and ISP2 and its IPv4 
   address. Host A chooses either one as the source locator of the 
   outgoing packets. Upon receiving the packets, the site border router, 
   BR1, performs source-based policy routing. For example, if the source 
   locator is from ISP1, the packets will be forwarded to ISP1, 
   otherwise, they will be forwarded to ISP2. In addition, BR1 could 
   also rewrite the LD ID of the source locator to the one assigned from 
   another ISP according to the configured traffic-engineering policy, 
   and then forward the packets to the corresponding ISP according to 
   source-based policy routing. Similar to the GSE [GSE], the site-
   controlled traffic-engineering by rewriting the source LD ID will 
   impact the path (upstream ISP) selection for both outgoing packets 
   and returned packets.  

   In addition, since each ID->locator mapping in the ID->Locator 
   mapping system is associated with a preference. By setting different 
   preference values for different locators of a given host which is 
   located inside a multi-homed site network, the upstream ISP selection 
   for the incoming traffic can also influenced.

   2.7. Host Mobility and Multi-homing 

   To some extent, host multi-homing is similar to host mobility since 
   their effects on the network and on correspondents are identical.  

   In RANGI, when a host physically moves from one attachment point of 
   network to another in the event of mobility or re-homing, it SHOULD 
   inform its current correspondents of its new locator as soon as 
   possible. Furthermore, it needs to update its locator information on 
   the ID->Locator mapping authoritative server timely. In the case of 
   simultaneous mobility, at least one of the communicating entities 
   SHOULD resolve the correspondence node's new locator from the ID-
   >Locator mapping system so as to continue their communication. 

   In order to allow legacy IPv6 hosts to initiate communicates with 
   RANGI mobile hosts, many RANGI transit proxies SHOULD be deployed in 
   the transit networks and each of them is dedicated to a bunch of

   identifiers in a given AD scope and is responsible for translating 
   packets from IPv6 and RANGI, and vice versa. For more details, please 
   refer to the transit proxy mechanism defined in [RANGI-PROXY]. 

   2.8. Network Mobility 

   To mitigate the registration burden on the ID->Locator mapping system 
   triggered by network mobility, NEMO mechanism [RFC3963] is reused in 
   RANGI to support network mobility. That is to say, the mobile router 
   is responsible for updating its current locator on its home agent. As 
   a result, network mobility event is transparent to the hosts inside 
   that mobile network. Details about network mobility will be explored 
   in the latter version of this draft. 

3. Summary 

   RANGI achieves almost all of goals set by RRG, which are listed as 
   follows: 

   1) Routing Scalability: Scalability is achieved by separating 
      identifiers from locators.  

   2) Traffic Engineering: Hosts inside a multi-homed site can       
      suggest the upstream ISP for outgoing and returned packets by 
      using the appropriate source locator, while the local LDBRs have 
      the final decision on the upstream ISP selection since they can 
      perform site-controlled traffic-engineering through source locator 
      rewritting. 

   3) Mobility and Multi-homing: Sessions will not be interrupted due to 
      locator change in the case of mobility or re-homing. 

   4) Simplified Renumbering: When changing providers, the local IPv4       
      addresses of the site do not need to change. Hence the internal        
      routers within the site don't need renumbering. 

   5) Decoupling Location and Identifier: Obvious. 

   6) Routing Stability: Since the locators are topologically        
      aggregatable and the internal topology within the LD will not be        
      disclosed outside, routing stability could be improved greatly. 

   7) Routing Security: RANGI reuses existing routing system and does 
      not introduce any new security risk into the routing system.

                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   8) Incremental Deployability: RANGI allows an easy transition from       
      IPv4 networks to IPv6 networks.  In addition, RANGI proxy allows       
      RANGI-aware hosts to communicate to legacy IPv4 or IPv6 hosts,       
      and vice-versa.  

4. Security Considerations 

   TBD. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   A specific prefix for host IDs needs to be assigned from the IPv6 
   address space. 

   Two new options in the Destination Option Header need to be assigned 
   for the host ID and its corresponding parameter date structure 
   respectively.

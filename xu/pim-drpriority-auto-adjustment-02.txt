Abstract 

   This document defines some mechanisms for automatically adjusting 
   the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Designed Router (DR) 
   priority according to the status of the tracked interface. This 
   approach can be used to realize DR auto-switchover in case the DR 
   loses the route to multicast source or Rendezvous Point (RP).

Internet-Draft     PIM-SM DR Priority Auto-Adjustment    February 2010 
 
    
1. Problem Statement 

   In the Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) 
   specification [RFC4601], a Designated Routers (DR) plays a very 
   important role on the shared-media LAN like Ethernet which may have 
   more than one PIM-SM speaking routers and one or more hosts. One of 
   the PIM-SM speaking routers is designated aka elected (per interface) 
   to send (a) PIM join/prune messages upon receiving Internet Group 
   Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376] membership report/leave 
   messages from multicast receivers/hosts, or (b) PIM Register packets 
   to a Rendezvous Point (RP) on behalf of the multicast senders. DR 
   election happens on all interfaces, LAN or otherwise. 

   To achieve DR redundancy, multiple PIM routers are usually deployed 
   in a shared-media LAN like Ethernet. As depicted in the following 
   figure, two PIM routers R1, R2 are connected to the same LAN where a 
   multicast receiver is located. Assume R1 is elected as the DR for 
   that LAN. Now R1's upstream link to the outside network is down, as 
   a result, R1 will lose the reachability to the multicast senders 
   and/or RPs. If R1 doesn't quit the DR role, the multicast service 
   for the receiver will be broken even though R2 may still have 
   reachability to the multicast senders and/or RPs.              

               |   +-----+    +------------------+ 
               +---+ R1  +----+                  | 
               |   +-----+    |                  | 
  +--------+   |              |                  |  +-------+ 
  |Receiver+---+              | Outside Network  +--+Sender | 
  +--------+   |              |   (Run PIM-SM)   |  +-------+ 
               |   +-----+    |                  | 
               +---+ R2  +----+                  | 
               |   +-----+    +------------------+ 
                 

   In most cases, the recovery of the multicast forwarding tree is 
   dependent on the unicast route convergence. However, in a topology 
   such as the one illustrated above, the (LAN) interface between R1 
   and R2 is treated passive from the routing protocol perspective for 
   obvious reasons (flooding, scale, spoofing etc.), mooting the 
   unicast routing convergence applicability.  

   While it is possible that a failover static route can be configured 
   on these two routers instead of running IGP, that's to say, each PIM 
   router is configured with a default route with its next-hop pointed 
   to the opposite side, and this default route will not take effect 
   until the reachability to the outside network is lost. However, this 
   approach has a few side-effects. Assume these two routers are

   connected to the same Internet Service Provider (ISP) network via 
   different links, once the default route learnt from the ISP is 
   withdrawn, the forwarding loop will occur between them upon 
   receiving a packet whose best route is the configured default route. 
   Another side-effect with this approach is when the upstream link to 
   the outside network recovers (from down to up), the RPF interface 
   will change. As a result, the transient forwarding interruption due 
   to SPT/RPT rebuilding will occur. Although this transient 
   interruption issue due to the unicast route change can be alleviated 
   by using some make-before-break mechanism (e.g., by borrowing some 
   ideas from RPT->SPT switch mechanism, the old upstream link will not 
   be pruned until the stream is received from the new upstream link.), 
   the cost is relatively high for this scenario. 

2. DR Priority Auto-adjustment Mechanism 

   A PIM router could exactly cease the DR role by decreasing its DR 
   priority once it loses routes to the RPs or multicast sources. Since 
   the addresses of the RPs or the multicast sources may not be known 
   to it, the PIM router could simply determine whether or not it has 
   lost the route to the RPs or multicast sources just by tracking the 
   status of its upstream link. This approach is much similar to the 
   interface tracking mechanism of the Virtual Router Redundancy 
   Protocol (VRRP) [RFC2338]. Taken the above scenario as an example, 
   R1 will track its upstream link to the outside network, once the 
   upstream link is down, its PIM DR priority will be reduced 
   automatically so as to cease the DR role. As a result, R2 will take 
   over the DR role. To speed up the DR switchover further, as soon as 
   the DR priority adjustment occurs, a new hello message containing 
   the current DR priority will be triggered. 

   In most cases, two last-hop routers each with an upstream link are 
   enough for redundancy purpose. In case there are more than one 
   upstream links on a PIM router, all of these interfaces should be 
   tracked for the DR priority adjustment. As long as there is a route 
   to the outside network, it is not necessary for the DR switchover to 
   take place. However, if the number of uplink interfaces is large, 
   the network administrator can actually choose part of uplinks which 
   are to be tracked for the DR adjustment. 

   Once the failed upstream link on R1 recovers (from down to up), its 
   DR priority can be either recovered to the original value or not 
   according to the pre-configured preemption policy. If preemption is 
   not allowed, its DR priority will remain unchanged so as to avoid 
   unnecessary DR switchover. As a result, the transient multicast 
   forwarding interruption due to multicast forwarding tree rebuilding 
   can be avoided. Once the current DR fails or its DR priority changes,

   the non-DRs SHOULD restore theirs DR priorities to their original 
   value provided they have got route to the uplinks for competing in a 
   new round of DR election.  

   In fact, if VRRP is run on the PIM routers and the VRRP has enabled 
   the upstream link tracking mechanism, the PIM DR switchover 
   mechanism could be coupled with the VRRP so as to reuse the upstream 
   link tracking mechanism of VRRP. One option is to synchronize the 
   PIM DR priority value to the VRRP priority value always. In this way, 
   the PIM DR and the VRRP master will always run on an identical 
   router if the VRRP Preempt_Mode is set to True. Another option is to 
   make the PIM DR and the VRRP master run on an identical router 
   anyway (i.e., regardless whether or not the VRRP Preempt_Mode is 
   True). To achieve this goal, the PIM DR priority of the VRRP master 
   router SHOULD always be set to a higher fixed value than that of the 
   VRRP slave router automatically.  

   Note that these approaches are fully compatible with the current PIM 
   specification. There is no need to change the PIM protocol on wire 
   at all since they are just internal implementations.  

   Although the PIM router could cease the DR role by declaring its 
   death directly, e.g., sending a hello message with a zero HoldTime, 
   or keeping silent till it times out, this approach has a few 
   limitations in some specific scenarios. Taking the above scenario as 
   an example, assume there is another multicast sender directly 
   connected to R1 via another interface. Since the receiver and this 
   sender are connected to the same PIM router, the receiver ought to 
   be able to receive the multicast stream from this sender. However, 
   in case there is another multicast source in the outside network 
   using the same address (i.e., in anycast source scenario), a problem 
   due to PIM assert failure will occur since join/prune or assert 
   messages from a non-neighbor will be discarded silently according to 
   the PIM specification. 

3. Security Considerations 

   The DR priority auto-adjustment mechanisms described in this 
   document does not introduce any new security risk. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   There is no IANA consideration for this document.

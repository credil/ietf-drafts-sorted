                draft-mbenjamin-nfsv4-pnfs-metastripe-01

Abstract

   This Internet-Draft describes a means to add metadata striping to
   pNFS.  The text of this draft is substantially based on prior drafts
   by Eisler, M., with some departures.  The current draft attempts to
   define a somewhat lighter-weight protocol, in particular, seeks to
   permit striping for "filehandle only" operations such as LOCK and
   OPEN + CLAIM_FH, without clients having to obtain metadata layouts on
   regular files.  We gratefully acknowledge the primary contributions
   of Mike Eisler, Pranoop Ersani, and others.

Internet-Draft               pNFS Metastripe                   July 2013


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   The NFSv4.1 specification describes pNFS [NFSv4.1]. pNFS distributes
   (stripes) file data across multiple storage devices.  In NFSv4.1,
   parallel access is limited to the data contents of regular files.
   Metadata is not distributed or striped: the model presented in the
   NFSv4.1 specification is that of a single metadata server.  This
   document describes a means to add metadata striping to pNFS, which
   includes the notion of multiple metadata servers.

   Two methods are described.  The first, called inode striping, directs
   metadata operations associated with a file handle to a preferred
   metadata server.  The second, called dentry striping, distributes
   directory operations across a collection of metadata servers.  With
   metadata striping, multiple metadata servers may work together to
   provide a higher parallel performance.


2.  Short List of Protocol Changes from Previous Drafts

2.1.  File-system wide Striping for Filehandle-Only Operations

   Stripe hints redirect clients to a preferred metadata server for
   filehandle-only operations (below), but are backed by a single layout
   per-file system, rather than per-file, as in [METASTRIPE].  The new
   model is lighter weight, but since it remains layout-based retains
   the advantages of pNFS device indirection and garbage collection.

2.2.  Uniform Filehandles

   [METASTRIPE] offers implementations the option to propagate layout
   filehandles for all metadata layout types.  Since it would be
   impossible to reasonably support this under the new proposed model
   for filehandle-only operations, we propose instead that L-MDS
   filehandles always be equivalent to I-MDS filehandles.

2.3.  Simplified Multipath Device Model

   [METASTRIPE] defines two different methods for encoding metadata
   server locations, only the "simple" model uses the pNFS device
   mechanism.  In this draft, we propose a single model based on pNFS
   devices, in which there is a one-to-one mapping between devices and
   L-MDS servers.  This approach facilitates sharing device addresses
   across layouts which have servers in common and also minimizes the
   difficulty of reclaiming devices no longer in use by any metadata
   layout.

Internet-Draft               pNFS Metastripe                   July 2013


2.4.  Cookie Model

   NFSv4 associates with each entry in a directory a unique value of
   type cookie4, a 64-bit integer.  [METASTRIPE] involves cookies in
   stripe selection, and imposes specific requirements on cookie values.
   In the current proposal we treat cookies as opaque values except as
   specified in ordinary NFSv4.1.  We concur with [METASTRIPE] that
   cookies MUST be unique within any logical directory regardless of the
   striping pattern.  As in ordinary NFSv4.1, the behavior of READDIR
   (or PREADDIR, below) when cookie has a value previously returned to a
   client by the same server, but no longer associated with any
   directory entry, is not defined.

2.5.  LAYOUTCOMMIT

   In this draft, we introduce layout-subtype specific data for the
   LAYOUTCOMMIT operation.

2.6.  Recommended Attributes

   We propose two new recommended attributes.

      meta_stripe_deviceid (deviceid4)

      meta_stripe_count (uint32_t)

2.6.1.  meta_stripe_deviceid (deviceid4)

   An attribute of type meta_stripe_deviceid represents an inode stripe
   hint.  This attribute MUST NOT be offered to clients unless they hold
   a valid inode striping layout on the containing file system.

2.6.2.  meta_stripe_count (uint32_t)

   The meta_stripe_count attribute represents, for directory objects,
   the directory's current stripe count, which may help the client
   decide if it will request a dentry striping layout on the directory.
   This attribute MAY be offered only to clients which hold an inode
   striping layout on the containing file system.

2.7.  PREADDIR (Operation)

   The NFSv4.1 READDIR operation has insufficient information to perform
   all possible enumerations required in our proposed dentry striping
   model.  We propose a new PREADDIR operation which takes, in addition
   to all the current READDIR operations, also a controlling metadata
   layout stateid and stripe number.

3.  Terminology

      Initial Metadata Server (I-MDS).  The I-MDS is the metadata server
      from which the client obtains a filehandle prior to acquiring any
      layout on the file.

      Layout Metadata Server (L-MDS).  The L-MDS is the metadata server
      from which the client obtains a filehandle from after redirection
      from a layout.

      Regular file: An object of file type NF4REG or NF4NAMEDATTR.

      Inode striping.  Hint-based indirection to a preferred MDS for
      filehandle-based operations, backed by a filesystem-wide metadata
      layout.

      Dentry striping.  Fine-grained, layout-based indirection for
      parallel operations on directories, using a striping pattern.


4.  Scope of Metadata Layouts

   This proposal assumes a model where there are two or more servers
   capable of supporting NFSv4.1 operations.  At least one server is an
   I-MDS, and the I-MDS should be thought of as a normal NFSv4.1 server,
   with the additional capability of granting metadata layouts on
   demand.  The I-MDS might also be capable of granting non-metadata
   layouts, but this is orthogonal to the scope of metadata striping.

   The model also requires at least one additional server, an L-MDS,
   that is capable of supporting NFSv4.1 operations that are directed to
   the server by the I-MDS.  It is permissible for an I-MDS to also be
   an L-MDS, and an L-MDS to also be an I-MDS.  Indeed, a simple
   submodel is for every NFSv4.1 server in a set to be both an I-MDS and
   L-MDS.

   For convenience, we divide NFSv4.1 metadata operations into three
   classes:

      Filehandle-only.  These are operations that take only filehandles
      as arguments, i.e. the current filehandle, or both the current
      filehandle and the saved filehandle, and no component names of
      files (e.g., LOCK, LAYOUTGET).

      Name-based.  These are operations that take one or two filehandles
      (i.e. the current filehandle, or both the current file handle and
      the saved filehandle) and one or two component names of files
      (e.g., LINK, RENAME).

Internet-Draft               pNFS Metastripe                   July 2013


      Directory-enumeration.  These are operations that take one
      filehandle and return the contents of a directory.  Currently,
      NFSv4 has only one such operation, READDIR.  This draft adds a
      section, PREADDIR.

   Metadata striping applies to all of the foregoing NFSv4.x operations,
   and is of two types:

      inode striping uses hints (attribute-based indications) backed by
      a filesystem-wide layout to direct clients to a preferred MDS on
      which to perform filehandle-only operations

      dentry striping uses fine-grained metadata layouts on directories
      to support execution of name-based operations (directory
      enumeration, creates) on a set of MDS servers in parallel

4.1.  Inode Striping

   To avoid an explosion of new client state, a coarse-grained hinting
   mechanism is used to direct filehandle-only operations to a preferred
   metadata server.

   As specified in 5.12.1 of [NFSv4.1], when a client encounters file
   system which supports LAYOUT4_METADATA, it can obtain a metadata
   layout of subtype LAYOUTMETA4_INODE, whose scope is the entire file
   system, using the LAYOUTGET operation on any filehandle object in the
   file system which it is permitted to access.

   Then using ordinary READDIR and GETATTR requests, the client can
   obtain for any object in the file system a meta_stripe_deviceid
   attribute that indicates the preferred device to send filehandle-only
   or name-based operations for that object.

   For example, suppose that after obtaining an ordinary filehandle via
   OPEN, a LAYOUTMETA4_INODE layout on the containing file system, and a
   meta_stripe_deviceid hint from a previous GETATTR, READDIR, or
   PREADDIR,, the client wants to get a byte range lock on the file.
   The client sends the LOCK request to the network address (pNFS
   device, L-MDS) indicated by the meta_stripe_deviceid attribute.

4.2.  Dentry Striping

   For name-based and directory enumeration operations, a more fine-
   grained, layout-based redirection mechanism is used.

   When a client obtains a filehandle for an object that is of type
   directory and wishes to take advantage of metadata striping, the
   client first obtains a metadata layout of subtype LAYOUTMETA4_DENTRY

   on the directory.  The client is provided with a directory-specific
   list of network addresses (devices) to which to send requests
   specific to objects in that directory.

4.2.1.  Name-Based Operations

   For name-based operations, the dentry striping layout indicates the
   preferred destinations in the network to send name-based operations
   for that directory (e.g., CREATE).  The preferred destinations MUST
   apply to the current filehandle that the operation uses.  In other
   words, for LINK and RENAME, which take both the saved filehandle and
   the current filehandle as parameters, the pNFS client would use the
   stripe hint of the target directory (indicated in the current
   filehandle) for guidance where to send the operation.  Note that if
   an L-MDS accepts a LINK or RENAME operation, the L-MDS MUST perform
   the operation atomically.  If it cannot, then the L-MDS MUST return
   the error NFS4ERR_XDEV, and the client MUST send the operation to the
   I-MDS.

   The choice of destination is a function of the name the client is
   requesting.  For example, after the client obtains the filehandle of
   a directory via LOOKUP and the metadata layout via LAYOUTGET, the
   client wants to open a regular file within the directory.  As with
   the LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES layout type, the client has a list network
   addresses to which to send requests.  With the LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES
   layout, the choice of the index in the list of network addresses was
   computed from the offset of the read or write request.  With the
   metadata layout, the choice of the index is derived from the name (or
   some other method, such as the name and one or more attributes of the
   directory, such as the filehandle, fileid, as below.) passed to OPEN.

4.2.2.  Directory Enumeration

   For directory-enumeration operations, the dentry striping layout
   indicates the preferred destination in the network to send (P)READDIR
   operations for that directory.  For example, after the client obtains
   the filehandle of a directory via LOOKUP and the metadata layout via
   LAYOUTGET, the client wants to read the directory.  As with the
   LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES layout type, the client has a list network
   addresses to which to send requests.  With the LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES
   layout, the choice of the index in list of network addresses was
   computed from the offset of the read or write request.  For dentry
   striping layouts, the index counts from 0 to the dentry stripe count,
   less 1.

5.  The Metadata Striping Layout

5.1.  Name

   The name of the metadata striping layout type is LAYOUT4_METADATA.

5.2.  Value

   The value of the metadata striping layout type is TBD1.

5.3.  Data Type Definitions

5.3.1.  Layout Hint

        ///  %
        ///  %/* Encoded in the loh_body field of type layouthint4: */
        ///  %
        ///  struct md_dirsize_layouthint4 {
        ///         uint64_t *mdlh_min_est;
        ///         uint64_t *mdlh_avg_est;
        ///         uint64_t *mdlh_max_est;
        ///         uint32_t *mdlh_stripe_count;
        ///         uint32_t *mdlh_stripe_modulus;
        ///  };

                                 Figure 1

   The layout-type specific layouthint4 content for the LAYOUT4_METDATA
   layout type is composed of four fields, each optional.  Using some
   combination of the mdlh_min_est, mdlh_avg_est, and mdlh_max_est
   fields, the client is enabled to give an indication of the dentry
   workload it expects for a new directory inode.  The client also may
   suggest an explicit stripe count or modulus preference in
   mdlh_stripe_count or mdlh_stripe_modulus, which SHOULD be congruent
   if specified together.

5.3.2.  Devices

   ///  % /*
   ///  %  * Encoded in the da_addr_body field of data type
   ///  %  * device_addr4:
   ///  %  */
   ///  struct md_layout_addr4 {
   ///      multipath_list4    mdla_multipath_list<>;
   ///  };

5.4.  Metadata Layout Semantics

   The reply to a successful LAYOUTGET request MUST contain exactly one
   element in logr_layout.  The element contains the metadata layout.

5.4.1.  LAYOUTGET Argument Conventions

   When a client requests a layout of type LAYOUT4_METADATA, it
   specifies the desired subtype, which must be one of LAYOUTMETA4_INODE
   or LAYOUTMETA4_DENTRY, as the value of the LAYOUTGET loga_iomode
   argument.

5.4.2.  Inode Striping Layouts

   If the requested layout is of subtype LAYOUTMETA4_INODE, the value of
   the layout is void.  The inode redirection information issued under
   auspices of the layout will be entirely in the form of inode striping
   attribute hints.

   As noted in Section 4, the scope of inode striping layouts is an
   entire file system.  The client can acquire the (singleton) inode
   striping layout for a given file system using any corresponding file



Benjamin, et al.        Expires January 14, 2014               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               pNFS Metastripe                   July 2013


   handle which it happens to hold, and whose object the client is
   permitted to access.  For example, the client could use the file
   handle of the first directory it traverses on a given file system,
   provided the file server is an NFSv4.x file server that supports
   layouts of type LAYOUT4_METADATA.

5.4.2.1.  Inode Stripe Hints

   Inode stripe hints are objects of type deviceid4, and are the value
   of a new recommended, get-only attribute meta_stripe_deviceid.

   A client may successfully obtain the meta_stripe_deviceid attribute
   on any file object if and only if it has successfully obtained an
   inode striping layout on the containing file system.  Since the
   meta_stripe_deviceid hint is an ordinary NFSv4 attribute, the client
   may acquire it from a GETATTR, READDIR, or PREADDIR request.  A
   server implementation SHOULD interpret a PREADDIR operation (which
   has a controlling metadata layout stateid) as a request for just
   those attributes that are appropriate for the layout stateid that has
   been presented.

   At all events, when a client holds an inode stripe hint for a file
   object, it uses the GETDEVICEINFO operation to map the hint value to
   a to a device address of data type md_layout_addr4 in the ordinary
   pNFS manner.

   The server ensures that each such device remains accessible
   (unrecalled) for at least as long as any inode striping layout exists
   for which the device has been named in a hint.

5.4.3.  Dentry Striping Layouts

   If the requested layout is of subtype LAYOUTMETA4_DENTRY, then the
   layout contains a <device list, striping pattern, algorithm> triple
   enabling the client to perform both parallel directory enumeration
   operations and stripe-aware name-based operations, as outlined in
   Section 4.

   When the layout subtype is LAYOUTMETA4_DENTRY, the layout content
   provides an integer identifying a hashing algorithm, a list of
   deviceids, and a striping pattern.  Then mdln_namebased_alg
   identifies an algorithm that maps a name, as a component4, to an
   integer.  Each entry in the mdln_devicelist specifies a set of
   metadata servers that may be treated as equally valid for metadata
   requests to the same block in the partitioned namespace.  Each entry
   in the stripe pattern is an index into the device list.

   To perform a name based operation, the client maps the name to a



Benjamin, et al.        Expires January 14, 2014               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               pNFS Metastripe                   July 2013


   number with the name based algorithm, looks that number up in the
   stripe pattern (modulo the length of the stripe pattern), yielding a
   device id that may be interpreted with GETDEVICEINFO, in the ordinary
   pNFS manner.  After resolving the device id as a device address of
   data type md_layout_addr4, the client sends the request to any of the
   devices specified in the corresponding entry in the device list.

5.4.3.1.  L-MDS Selection for Name-based Operations

   Clients with layouts of type LAYOUTMETA4_DENTRY may use the algorithm
   supplied in field mdln_namebased_alg of the layout content to compute
   a preferred L-MDS to use when performing name-based operations, as
   follows:

Let F be the function specified in mdln_namebased_alg;

Let X = (x1, x2, x3, ...) some set of inputs for  function F, such
that x1 SHOULD be the component name of the file, and x2, x3, ... any
additional parameters required for the chosen F, their arguments
asserted to be values available to the client.

Let stripe_unit_number = F(X);
Let stripe_count = number of elements in mdl_layout.mdln_stripe_pattern;
Let idx =
    mdl_layout.mdln_stripe_pattern(stripe_unit_number % stripe_count);
Let deviceid = mdl_layout.mdln_devicelist[idx];

   pseudocode

                                 Figure 5

   The client then selects an L-MDS indicated by the deviceid (using
   GETDEVICEINFO in the normal manner), and sends the name-based
   operation to that server.

   The current proposal defines a single algorithm, consisting of
   application of the 64-bit CityHash non-cryptographic hashing function
   [CITY], with x1 the desired component name, and x2 the 32-bit seed
   value returned in the layout.

5.4.3.2.  Directory Enumeration

   Clients with layouts of type LAYOUTMETA4_DENTRY may use the following
   algorithm to perform enumeration of striped directories preferred
   metadata servers, in parallel:






Benjamin, et al.        Expires January 14, 2014               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               pNFS Metastripe                   July 2013


   For stripe_number in 0 .. length(mdl_layout.mdln_stripe_pattern) -1
           do
                   Let stripe =
                       mdl_layout.mdln_stripe_pattern[stripe_number];
                   Let device = mdl_layout.mdln_devicelist[stripe];
   <PREADDIR at device, layout_stateid, stripe_number>

   pseudocode

                                 Figure 6

   That is, for each logical stripe in the directory, the client notes
   stripe number (merely the stripe's offset in the sequence), and
   derives from it the corresponding index into mdln_devicelist by
   indirection on mdln_stripe_pattern.  The object at
   mdln_devicelist[stripe_number] is a device id, which the client maps
   to an L-MDS using GETDEVICEINFO, and performs a sequence of PREADDIR
   operations on that server.  The PREADDIR operation behaves exactly as
   described in section 18.23.3 of [NFSv4.1], but takes in addition to
   the arguments of READDIR, a metadata layout stateid and stripe
   number.

   As in ordinary NFSv4.1, to perform a full enumeration of the
   directory entries at each component L-MDS, the client commences
   iteration by sending a cookie argument of zero for the first PREADDIR
   operation in the current stripe, and continues performing PREADDIR
   operations supplying for the cookie argument the value of last cookie
   value returned in the prior PREADDIR operation in the same logical
   (L-MDS) enumeration only, until a PREADDIR operation indicates that
   no further entries are available.  The client and server behavior for
   subsequent re-traversals of a previously-enumerated logical directory
   are exactly as in ordinary NFSv4.1, except with respect to entry and
   cookie partitioning as described here.  The client SHOULD present to
   a component L-MDS only cookie values previously returned to that
   client by that same L-MDS, or 0 to commence iteration.  An L-MDS MAY
   reject with NFS4ERR_BADCOOKIE PREADDIR operations using cookie values
   that are valid cookies for the logical directory, but which are local
   to another L-MDS segment.

5.5.  LAYOUTCOMMIT

   As inode striping layouts are effectively read-only, the layout
   specific data for metastripe layouts of subtype LAYOUTMETA4_INODE is
   void.

   For metastripe layouts of subtype LAYOUTMETA4_DENTRY, the layout
   specific data for LAYOUTCOMMIT contains the signed count of items
   added to and removed from the directory since the last LAYOUTCOMMIT

   operation.


6.  Further Considerations

6.1.  Storage Access Protocols

   The LAYOUT4_METADATA layout type uses NFSv4.1 operations (and
   potentially, operations of higher minor versions of NFSv4, subject to
   the definition of a minor version of NFSv4) to access striped
   metadata.  The LAYOUT4_METADATA does not affect access to storage
   devices, and indeed, in the protocol described here, layouts of type
   LAYOUT4_METADATA and ordinary pNFS layouts for parallel data access
   (e.g., LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES, LAYOUT4_OSD2_OBJECTS, or
   LAYOUT4_BLOCK_VOLUME, or a future flexible files layout), are
   orthogonal.

6.2.  Revocation of Layouts

   Servers MAY revoke layouts of type LAYOUT4_METADATA.  A client
   detects if layout has been revoked if the operation is rejected with
   NFS4ERR_PNFS_NO_LAYOUT.  In NFSv4.1, the error NFS4ERR_PNFS_NO_LAYOUT
   could be returned only by READ and WRITE.  When the server returns a
   layout of type LAYOUT4_METADATA, the set of operations that can
   return NFS4ERR_PNFS_NO_LAYOUT is: ACCESS, CLOSE, COMMIT, CREATE,
   DELEGRETURN, GETATTR, LINK, LOCK, LOCKT, LOCKU, LOOKUP, LOOKUPP,
   NVERIFY, OPEN, OPENATTR, OPEN_DOWNGRADE, PREADDIR, READ, READDIR,
   READLINK, REMOVE, RENAME, SECINFO, SETATTR, VERIFY, WRITE,
   GET_DIR_DELEGATION, SECINFO, SECINFO_NO_NAME, and WANT_DELEGATION.

6.3.  Stateids

   The pNFS specification for LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES states data servers
   MUST be aware of the stateids granted by MDS so that the stateids
   passed to READ and WRITE can be properly validated.  Similarly, in
   layouts of type LAYOUT4_METADATA, the L-MDS MUST be aware of layout
   stateids issued by the controlling I-MDS in the corresponding layout.

   In addition, the L-MDS MUST be aware of any non-layout stateids
   granted by the I-MDS, if and only if the client is in contact the
   L-MDS under direction of a metadata layout returned by the I-MDS, and
   the I-MDS has not recalled or revoked that layout.  In addition,
   because an L-MDS can accept operations like OPEN and LOCK that create
   or modify stateids, the I-MDS MUST be aware of stateids that an L-MDS
   has returned to a client, if and only if the I-MDS granted the client
   a metadata layout that directed the client to the L-MDS.

   In some cases, one L-MDS MUST be aware of a stateid generated by



Benjamin, et al.        Expires January 14, 2014               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft               pNFS Metastripe                   July 2013


   another L-MDS.  For example a client can obtain a stateid from the
   L-MDS serving as the destination of name-based operations, which
   includes OPEN.  However, operations that use the stateid will be
   filehandle-only operations, and the L-MDS the OPEN operation is sent
   to might differ from the L-MDS the LOCK operation for the same target
   file is sent to.

   When a client obtains a non-layout stateid from an L-MDS, for
   example, as the result of an OPEN operation, the stateid is asserted
   to be valid at the issuing L-MDS, and also the assocated I-MDS, as
   noted above.  In addition, if the client holds an inode striping
   layout on the current file system, it SHOULD request the associated
   stripe hint on the object, ideally in the same COMPOUND.

6.4.  Lease Terms

   Any state the client obtains from an I-MDS or L-MDS is guaranteed to
   last for an interval lasting as long as the maximum of the lease_time
   attribute of the the I-MDS, and any L-MDS the client is directed to
   as the result of a metadata layout.  The client has a lease for each
   client ID it has with an I-MDS or L-MDS, and each lease MUST be
   renewed separately for each client ID.

6.5.  Layout Operations Sent to an L-MDS

   An L-MDS MAY allow a LAYOUTGET operation of type LAYOUT4_METADATA.
   One reason the L-MDS might allow such a LAYOUTGET operation is to
   allow hierarchical striping.  For example, for name-based operations,
   the pNFS server might use a radix tree, (which the field
   mdln_namebased_alg would indicate).  The first four bytes of the
   component name would be combined to form a 32-bit stripe_unit_number.
   Once the client contacted the L-MDS, it would repeat the algorithm on
   the second four bytes of the component, and so on until the component
   name was exhausted.

   More typically, an L-MDS MAY allow a LAYOUTGET operation of type
   LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES, LAYOUT4_OSD2_OBJECTS, or LAYOUT4_BLOCK_VOLUME.
   Naturally, a reason to allow this would be for increased pNFS MDS
   scalability.

   Once an L-MDS grants a layout, the client MUST use only the L-MDS
   that granted the layout to send LAYOUTUPDATE, LAYOUTCOMMIT, and
   LAYOUTRETURN.

6.6.  Filehandles in Metadata Layouts

   Metadata layouts do not present filehandles.

6.7.  Restriping

6.7.1.  Layout Recall Cases

   When a server implementation intends to perform restriping, it MUST
   ensure that it has successfully recalled any metadata layout which
   would be invalidated by the restriping.

   If the implementation wishes to restripe a directory on which there
   are outstanding layouts of type LAYOUTMETA4_DENTRY, it must first
   successfully recall these layouts at their controlling I-MDS servers,
   as described in [NFSv4.1].

   If the implementation wishes to perform inode restriping which would
   invalidate any inode stripe hint which it has issued to clients, it
   MUST successfully recall all controlling layouts of type
   LAYOUTMETA4_INODE which would conflict with the restriping.

   Naturally, if a client requests an L-MDS to perform any operation
   under the auspices of a metadata layout which is no longer valid, the
   L-MDS is not required to perform it.  The L-MDS SHOULD fail the
   operation with NFS4ERR_PNFS_NO_LAYOUT.

6.7.2.  Hint Invalidation

   When an implementation wishes to perform inode restriping that would
   invalidate an inode stripe hint or hints it has issued to clients, it
   can use ordinary NFSv4.1 invalidation to reclaim the hints.  Since
   inode stripe hints are recommended attributes, the controlling I-MDS
   or L-MDS does this by updating the change attribute on the inode
   being updated, as it would for any other inode update.

6.8.  Recovery

   [[Comment.1: it is likely this section will follow that of the files
   layout type specified in the NFSv4.1 specification.]]

6.9.  Failure and Restart of Client

   TBD

6.10.  Failure and Restart of Server

   TBD

7.  Negotiation

   The NFSv4.x client sends a GETATTR operation for attribute
   fs_layout_type.  If the reply contains the metadata layout type, then
   either or both of inode or dentry striping are supported, subject to
   further verification by subsequent LAYOUTGET operations.  If not, the
   client cannot use metadata striping.

   workload will involve a high fraction of non-I/O operations on

   filehandles.


10.  Acknowledgements

   We gratefully acknowledge the primary contributions of Mike Eisler,
   Pranoop Ersani, and others, in [METASTRIPE].

   From prior drafts, Brent Welch had the idea of returning a separate
   device ID for filehandle-only operations in the metadata layout.
   Pranoop Erasani, Dave Noveck, and Richard Jernigan provided valuable
   feedback.


11.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of Section 13.12 of [NFSv4.1] which are
   specific to data servers apply to l-MDSes.  In addition, each l-MDS
   server and client are, respectively, a complete NFSv4.1 server and
   client, and so the security considerations of [NFSv4.1] apply to any
   client or server using the metadata layout type.


12.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requires an addition to the Layout Types registry
   described in Section 22.4 of [NFSv4.1].  The five fields added to the
   registy are:

   1.  Name of layout type: LAYOUT4_METADATA.

   2.  Value of layout type: TBD1.

   3.  Standards Track RFC that describes this layout: RFCTBD2, which
       would be the RFC of this document.

   4.  How the RFC Introduces the specification: minor revision (we
       believe).

   5.  Minor versions of NFSv4 that can use the layout type: [TBD].

   This specification requires the creation of a registry of hash
   algorithms for supporting the field mdln_namebased_alg.  Additional
   details TBD.

   This specification introduces two new recommended attributes
   (meta_stripe_deviceid and meta_stripe_count).

<abstract>
<t>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a data representation that provides a framework for sharing information commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents.  This document describes the information model for the 
IODEF and provides an associated data model specified with XML Schema.
</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
Organizations require help from other parties to mitigate malicious activity targeting their network and to gain insight into potential threats.  This coordination might entail working with an ISP to filter attack traffic, contacting a remote site to take down a bot-network, or sharing watch-lists of known malicious IP addresses in a consortium.
</t>
<t>
The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) is a format for representing computer security information commonly exchanged between Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).  It provides an XML representation for conveying incident information across administrative domains between parties that have an operational responsibility of remediation or a watch-and-warning over a defined constituency.  The data model encodes information about hosts, networks, and the services running on these systems; attack methodology and associated forensic evidence; impact of the activity; and limited approaches for documenting workflow.
</t>

<t>
The overriding purpose of the IODEF is to enhance the operational capabilities of CSIRTs.  Community adoption of the IODEF provides an improved ability to resolve incidents and convey situational awareness by simplifying collaboration and data sharing.  This structured format provided by the IODEF allows for:
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">

<t>increased automation in processing of incident data, since the resources of security analysts to parse free-form textual documents will be reduced;
</t>

<t>decreased effort in normalizing similar data (even when highly structured) from different sources; and 
</t>

<t>a common format on which to build interoperable tools for incident handling and subsequent analysis, specifically when data comes from multiple constituencies.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Coordinating with other CSIRTs is not strictly a technical problem.  There are numerous procedural, trust, and legal considerations that might prevent an organization from sharing information.  The IODEF does not attempt to address them.  However, operational implementations of the IODEF will need to consider this broader context.
</t>

<t>
Sections 3 and 8 specify the IODEF data model with text and an XML schema.  The types used by the data model are covered in Section 2.  Processing considerations, the handling of extensions, and internationalization issues related to the data model are covered in Sections 4, 5, and 6, respectively.  Examples are listed in Section 7.  Section 1 provides the background for the IODEF, and Section 9 documents the security considerations.

<section title="Changes from 5070" anchor="changes">
<t>				
<list style="symbols">
<t>This document contains changes with respect to its predecessor RFC5070 </t>
<t>All of the Errata that has been submitted at RFC5070 Errata has been implemented with the exception of #17 which instead of changing the UML, the schema waschanged.</t>	
<t>Addition of xmlns:ds and import of same namespace.  This is to use the digital signature hash inclusion of a file by referencing the existing standard as was done in RFC5901, RFC3275 is the reference, see RFC5901 section 5.9.5.2"></t>
<t>New indicator uid and set id values in the schema.  The purpose of the proposed changes is to include commonly shared indicators in the base IODEF schema.  This class will contain indicators from the list below that are not represented elsewhere in the schema.  IODEF extensions or embedded schemas via the SCI classes will be required to include additional data types.  A table could be maintained through IANA to extend or change this class in between IODEF revisions.</t>						
<t>RFC5901 provides a method to include an entire email, the following included indicators are ones commonly used when you do not need the entire email</t>
<t>The following are in the Service class:  Email Address, Email Subject, and X-Mailer</t>
<t>The following are in the Record class:  File Name, File Hash (5.9.5.2 - using ds:reference), and WindowsRegistryKey (using method from RFC5901</t>
<t>The following are now in the Node class as a proposed location:  URL</t>
<t>HTTPUserAgent is included as a SoftwareType - HTTP User Agent String</t>
<t>The following are already represented elsewhere in the schema (Node):  IP address, Network CIDR / ASN, Host Name, and Domain Name (additional options for RFC5901 were not included in this revision - can include point-in-time dig info)</t>

<section title="Notations" anchor="notation">
<t>
The normative IODEF data model is specified with the text in Section 3 and the XML schema in Section 8.  To help in the understanding of the data elements, Section 3 also depicts the underlying information model using Unified Modeling Language (UML).  This abstract presentation of the IODEF is not normative.
</t>
<t>
For clarity in this document, the term "XML document" will be used when referring generically to any instance of an XML document.  The term "IODEF document" will be used to refer to specific elements and attributes of the IODEF schema.  The terms "class" and "element" will be used interchangeably to reference either the corresponding data element in the information or data models, respectively.

</section> <!-- Notation -->

<section title="About the IODEF Data Model" anchor="about_dm">
<t>
The IODEF data model is a data representation that provides a framework for sharing information commonly exchanged by CSIRTs about computer security incidents.  A number of considerations were made in the design of the data model.
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The data model serves as a transport format.  Therefore, its specific representation is not the optimal representation for on-disk storage, long-term archiving, or in-memory processing.
</t>

<t>
As there is no precise widely agreed upon definition for an incident, the data model does not attempt to dictate one through its implementation.  Rather, a broad understanding is assumed in the IODEF that is flexible enough to encompass most operators. 
</t>

<t>
Describing an incident for all definitions would require an extremely complex data model.  Therefore, the IODEF only intends to be a framework to convey commonly exchanged incident information.  It ensures that there are ample mechanisms for extensibility to support organization-specific information, and techniques to reference information kept outside of the explicit data model.
</t>

<t>
The domain of security analysis is not fully standardized and must rely on free-form textual descriptions.  The IODEF attempts to strike a balance between supporting this free-form content, while still allowing automated processing of incident information.
</t>

<t>
The IODEF is only one of several security relevant data representations being standardized.  Attempts were made to ensure they were complimentary.  The data model of the <xref target="refs.IDMEF">Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format</xref> influenced the design of the IODEF.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>Further discussion of the desirable properties for the IODEF can be found in the <xref target="refs.requirements">Requirements for the Format for Incident Information Exchange (FINE)</xref>.</t>

</section>  <!-- About the IODEF Data Model -->

<section title="About the IODEF Implementation" anchor="about_implement">

<t>The IODEF implementation is specified as an <xref target="refs.xml">Extensible Markup Language (XML)</xref> <xref target="refs.schema">Schema</xref> in <xref target="schema" />.
</t>

<t>
Implementing the IODEF in XML provides numerous advantages.  Its extensibility makes it ideal for specifying a data encoding framework that supports various character encodings.  Likewise, the abundance of related technologies (e.g., XSL, XPath, XML-Signature) makes for simplified manipulation.  However, XML is fundamentally a text representation, which makes it inherently inefficient when binary data must be embedded or large volumes of data must be exchanged.</t>

	</list></t>

<t>The Incident class has five attributes:
<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="purpose"><vspace/>Required.  ENUM.  The purpose attribute represents the reason why the IODEF document was created.  It is closely related to the <xref target="Expectation">Expectation class</xref>.

This attribute is defined as an enumerated list:

<list style="numbers">
<t>traceback.  The document was sent for trace-back purposes.</t>

<t>mitigation.  The document was sent to request aid in mitigating the described activity.</t>

<t>reporting.  The document was sent to comply with reporting requirements.</t> 

<t>other.  The document was sent for purposes specified in the Expectation class.</t>

<t>ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.  See <xref target="extending_enums" />.</t>

</list></t>

<t hangText="ext-purpose"><vspace/>Optional.  STRING.  A means by which to extend the purpose attribute.  See <xref target="extending_enums" />.</t>

<t hangText="lang"><vspace/>Optional.  ENUM.  A valid language code per <xref target="refs.rfc4646">RFC 4646</xref> constrained by the definition of "xs:language".  The interpretation of this code is described in <xref target="internationalization" />. </t>

<t hangText="restriction"><vspace/>
Optional.  ENUM.  This attribute indicates the disclosure guidelines to which the sender expects the recipient to adhere for the information represented in this class and its children.  This guideline provides no security since there are no specified technical means to ensure that the recipient of the document handles the information as the sender requested.
</t>
<t>
The value of this attribute is logically inherited by the children of this class.  That is to say, the disclosure rules applied to this class, also apply to its children.  
</t>
<t>
It is possible to set a granular disclosure policy, since all of the high-level classes (i.e., children of the Incident class) have a restriction attribute.  Therefore, a child can override the guidelines of a parent class, be it to restrict or relax the disclosure rules (e.g., a child has a weaker policy than an ancestor; or an ancestor has a weak policy, and the children selectively apply more rigid controls).  The implicit value of the restriction attribute for a class that did not specify one can be found in the closest ancestor that did specify a value.
</t>
<t>
This attribute is defined as an enumerated value with a default value of "private".  Note that the default value of the restriction attribute is only defined in the context of the Incident class.  In other classes where this attribute is used, no default is specified.

<list style="numbers">
<t>public.  There are no restrictions placed in the information.</t>
<t>need-to-know.  The information may be shared with other parties that are involved in the incident as determined by the recipient of this document (e.g., multiple victim sites can be informed of each other).</t>
<t>private.  The information may not be shared.</t>

<?rfc needLines="5"?>
<t>default.  The information can be shared according to an information disclosure policy pre-arranged by the communicating parties.</t>
								
<t hangText="indicator-set-id"><vspace/>Optional.  STRING.  The indicator set ID is used to group releated indicators.</t>

<section title="AdditionalData Class" anchor="AdditionalData">
<t> The AdditionalData class serves as an extension mechanism for information not otherwise represented in the data model.  For relatively simple information, atomic data types (e.g., integers, strings) are provided with a mechanism to annotate their meaning.  The class can also be used to extend the data model (and the associated Schema) to support proprietary extensions by encapsulating entire XML documents conforming to another Schema (e.g., IDMEF).  A detailed discussion for extending the data model and the schema can be found in <xref target="extending" />.
</t>

<t>Unlike XML, which is self-describing, atomic data must be documented to convey its meaning.  This information is described in the 'meaning' attribute.  Since these description are outside the scope of the specification, some additional coordination may be required to ensure that a recipient of a document using the AdditionalData classes can make sense of the custom extensions.

<section title="Contact Class" anchor="contact">
<t>The Contact class describes contact information for organizations and personnel involved in the incident.  This class allows for the naming of the involved party, specifying contact information for them, and identifying their role in the incident.
</t>
<t>People and organizations are treated interchangeably as contacts; one can be associated with the other using the recursive definition of the class (the Contact class is aggregated into the Contact class).  The 'type' attribute disambiguates the type of contact information being provided.
</t>

<t>
The inheriting definition of Contact provides a way to relate information without requiring the explicit use of identifiers in the classes or duplication of data.  A complete point of contact is derived by a particular traversal from the root Contact class to the leaf Contact class.  As such, multiple points of contact might be specified in a single instance of a Contact class.  Each child
Contact class logically inherits contact information from its ancestors.

<section title="Relating the Incident and EventData Classes" anchor="Incident_Event">

<t>There is substantial overlap in the Incident and EventData classes. Nevertheless, the semantics of these classes are quite different.  The Incident class provides summary information about the entire incident, while the EventData class provides information about the individual events comprising the incident.  In the most common case, the EventData class will provide more specific information for the general description provided in the Incident class.  However, it may also be possible that the overall summarized information about the incident conflicts with some individual information in an EventData class when there is a substantial composition of various events in the incident.  In such a case, the interpretation of the more specific EventData MUST supersede the more generic information provided in IncidentData.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Cardinality of EventData" anchor="eventdata_cardinality">

<t>The EventData class can be thought of as a container for the properties of an event in an incident.  These properties include: the hosts involved, impact of the incident activity on the hosts, forensic logs, etc.  With an instance of the EventData class, hosts 	(i.e., System class) are grouped around these common properties.

</t>

<t>The recursive definition (or instance property inheritance) of the EventData class (the EventData class is aggregated into the EventData class) provides a way to related information without requiring the explicit use of unique attribute identifiers in the classes or duplicating information.  Instead, the relative depth (nesting) of a class is used to group (relate) information.
</t>

<t>
For example, an EventData class might be used to describe two machines involved in an incident.  This description can be achieved using multiple instances of the Flow class.  It happens that there is a common technical contact (i.e., Contact class) for these two machines, but the impact (i.e., Assessment class) on them is different.  A depiction of the representation for this situation can be found in <xref target="figure_reventdata_class" />.

When a Portlist class is defined in the Service class of both the source and target in a given instance of the Flow class, there MUST be symmetry in the enumeration of the ports.  Thus, if n-ports are listed for a source, n-ports should be listed for the target.  Likewise, the ports should be listed in an identical sequence such that the n-th port in the source corresponds to the n-th port of the target.  This symmetry in listing and sequencing of ports applies whether there are 1-to-1, 1-to-many, or many-to-many sources-to-targets.  In the 1-to-many or many-to-many, the exact order in which the System classes are enumerated in the Flow class is significant.

Every IODEF document MUST begin with an XML declaration, and MUST specify the XML version used.  If UTF-8 encoding is not used, the character encoding MUST also be explicitly specified.  The IODEF conforms to all XML data encoding conventions and constraints.

<t>
The IODEF documents MUST be well-formed XML and SHOULD be validated against the schema described in <xref target="schema" />.  However, mere conformance to the schema is not sufficient for a semantically valid IODEF document.  There is  additional specification in the text of Section 3 that cannot be readily encoded in the schema and it must also be considered by an IODEF parser.  The following is a list of discrepancies in what is more strictly specified in the normative text (Section 3), but not enforced in the IODEF schema:

<list style="symbols">
<t>The elements or attributes that are defined as POSTAL, NAME, PHONE, and EMAIL data-types are implemented as "xs:string", but more rigid formatting requirements are specified in the text.</t>

<t>The IODEF-Document@lang and MLStringType@lang attributes are declared as an "xs:language" that constrains values with a regular expression.  However, the value of this attribute still needs to be validated against the list of possible enumerated values is defined in <xref target="refs.rfc4646" />.</t>

<t>The MonetaryImpact@currency attribute is declared as an "xs:string", but the list of valid values as defined in <xref target="refs.iso4217" />.</t>

<t>All of the aggregated classes Contact and EventData are optional in the schema, but at least one of these aggregated classes MUST be present.</t>

<t>There are multiple conventions that can be used to categorize a system using the NodeRole class or to specify software with the Application and OperatingSystem classes.  IODEF parsers MUST accept incident reports that do not use these fields in accordance with local conventions.</t>

<t>The Confidence@rating attribute determines whether the element content of Confidence should be empty.</t>

<t>The Address@type attribute determines the format of the element content.</t>

<t>The attributes AdditionalData@dtype and RecordItem@dtype derived from iodef:ExtensionType determine the semantics and formatting of the element content.</t>

<section title="Extending the IODEF" anchor="extending">

<t>In order to support the changing activity of CSIRTS, the IODEF data model will need to evolve along with them.  This section discusses how new data elements that have no current representation in the data model can be incorporated into the IODEF.  These techniques are designed so that adding new data will not require a change to the IODEF schema.  With proven value, well documented extensions can be incorporated into future versions of the specification.  However, this approach also supports private extensions relevant only to a closed consortium.</t>

to an attribute.  For each attribute that supports this extension
technique, there is a corresponding attribute in the same element
whose name is identical, less a prefix of "ext-".  This special
attribute is referred to as the extension attribute, and the attribute
being extended is referred to as an extensible attribute.  For
example, an extensible attribute named "foo" will have a corresponding
extension attribute named "ext-foo".  An element may have many
extensible, and therefore many extension, attributes. 
</t>

<?rfc needLines="10" ?>
<t>
In addition to a corresponding extension attribute, each extensible attribute has "ext-value" as one its possible values.  This particular value serves as an escape sequence and has no valid meaning.
</t>

<t>
In order to add a new enumerated value to an extensible attribute, the value of this attribute MUST be set to "ext-value", and the new desired value MUST be set in the corresponding extension attribute.  For example, an extended instance of the type attribute of the Impact class would look as follows: 

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 <Impact type="ext-value" ext-type="new-attack-type">
]]></artwork></figure>
</t>
<t>
A given extension attribute MUST NOT be set unless the corresponding extensible attribute has been set to "ext-value".

<section title="Extending Classes" anchor="extending_classes">
<t>
The classes of the data model can be extended only through the use of the AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.  These container classes, collectively referred to as the extensible classes, are implemented with the iodef:ExtensionType data type in the schema.  They provide the ability to have new atomic or XML-encoded data elements in all of the top-level classes of the Incident class and a few of the more complicated subordinate classes.  As there are multiple instances of the extensible classes in the data model, there is discretion on where to add a new data element.  It is RECOMMENDED that the extension be placed in the most closely related class to the new information.
</t>
<t>
Extensions using the atomic data types (i.e., all values of the dtype attributes other than "xml") MUST:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Set the element content of extensible class to the desired value, and</t>
<t>Set the dtype attribute to correspond to the data type of the element content.
</t>
</list> 
</t>

<t>
The following guidelines exist for extensions using XML:
<list style="numbers">

<t>The element content of the extensible class MUST be set to the desired value and the dtype attribute MUST be set to "xml".</t>

<t>The extension schema MUST declare a separate namespace.  It is RECOMMENDED that these extensions have the prefix "iodef-".</t>

<t>It is RECOMMENDED that extension schemas follow the naming convention of the IODEF data model.  The names of all elements are capitalized.  For composed names, a capital letter is used for each word.  Attribute names are lower case.</t>  

<t>
When a parser encounters an IODEF document with an extension it does
not understand, this extension MUST be ignored (and not processed),
but the remainder of the document MUST be processed.  Parsers will able to identify these extensions for which they have no processing logic through the namespace declaration.  Parsers that encounter an unrecognized element in a namespace that they do support SHOULD reject the document as a syntax error.
</t>

<t>Implementations SHOULD NOT download schemas at runtime due to the security implications, and extensions MUST NOT be required to provide a resolvable location of their schema.
</t>
</list>
</t>
 
<t>
The following schema and XML document excerpt provide a template for an extension schema and its use in the IODEF document.  
</t>
<t>
This example schema defines a namespace of "iodef-extension1" and a single element named "newdata".

<section title="Internationalization Issues" 
         anchor="internationalization">

<t>Internationalization and localization is of specific concern to the IODEF, since it is only through collaboration, often across language barriers, that certain incidents be resolved.  The IODEF supports this goal by depending on XML constructs, and through explicit design choices in the data model.
</t>

<t>
Since IODEF is implemented as an XML Schema, it implicitly supports all the different character encodings, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, possible with XML.  Additionally, each IODEF document MUST specify the language in which their contents are encoded.  The language can be specified with the attribute "xml:lang" (per Section 2.12 of <xref target="refs.xml" />) in the top-level element (i.e., IODEF-Document@lang) and letting all other elements inherit that definition.  All IODEF classes with a free-form text definition (i.e., all those defined of type iodef:MLStringType) can also specify a language different from the rest of the document.  The valid language codes for the "xml:lang" attribute are described in <xref target="refs.rfc4646">RFC 4646</xref>.  
</t>

<t>
The data model supports multiple translations of free-form text.  In the places where free-text is used for descriptive purposes, the given class always has a one-to-many cardinality to its parent (e.g., Description class).  The intent is to allow the identical text to be encoded in different instances of the same class, but each being in a different language.  This approach allows an IODEF document author to send recipients speaking different languages an identical document.  The IODEF parser SHOULD extract the appropriate language relevant to the recipient.
</t>

<t>
While the intent of the data model is to provide internationalization and localization, the intent is not to do so at the detriment of interoperability.  While the IODEF does support different languages, the data model also relies heavily on standardized enumerated attributes that can crudely approximate the contents of the document.  With this approach, a CSIRT should be able to make some sense of an IODEF document it receives even if the text based data elements are written in a language unfamiliar to the analyst.

   ===  List of changes                                          ===
   ====================================================================
   CHANGE - new indicator values in the schema

   The purpose of the proposed changes is to include commonly shared
   indicators in the base IODEF schema.  This class will contain
   indicators from the list below that are not represented elsewhere
   in the schema.  IODEF extensions or embedded schemas via the SCI
   classes will be required to include additional data types.
   A table could be maintained through IANA to extend or change this
   class in between IODEF revisions.
   
  RFC5901 provides a method to include an entire email, the following
  included indicators are ones commonly used when you do not need the
  entire email
The following are in the Service Class:
      Email address
      Email subject
      X-Mailer
The following are in the Record class:
      File Name
      File Hash - 5.9.5.2 - using ds:reference
      WindowsRegistryKey - using method from RFC5901
  The following are now in the Node class as a proposed location.
      URL
  HTTPUserAgent is included as a SoftwareType
      HTTP User Agent String
  The following are already represented elsewhere in the schema (Node):
      IP address
      Network CIDR / ASN
      Host Name
      Domain Name (additional options for RFC5901 were not included in
                   this revision - can include point-in-time dig info)

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security_considerations">

<t>
The IODEF data model itself does not directly introduce security issues.  
Rather, it simply defines a representation for incident information.  As the data encoded by the IODEF might be considered privacy sensitive by the parties exchanging the information or by those described by it, care needs to be taken in ensuring the appropriate disclosure during both document exchange and subsequent processing.  The former must be handled by a messaging format, but the latter risk must be addressed by the systems that process, store, and archive IODEF documents and information derived from them.
</t>

<t>
The contents of an IODEF document may include a request for action or an IODEF parser may independently have logic to take certain actions based on information that it finds.  For this reason, care must be taken by the parser to properly authenticate the recipient of the document and ascribe an appropriate confidence to the data prior to action.
</t>

<t>
The underlying messaging format and protocol used to exchange instances of the IODEF MUST provide appropriate guarantees of confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  The use of a standardized security protocol is encouraged.  The <xref target="refs.rid">Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) protocol</xref> and its associated transport binding <xref target="refs.ridsoap">IODEF/RID over SOAP</xref> provide such security.
</t>

<t>
In order to suggest data processing and handling guidelines of the encoded information, the IODEF allows a document sender to convey a privacy policy using the restriction attribute.  The various instances of this attribute allow different data elements of the document to be covered by dissimilar policies.   While flexible, it must be stressed that this approach only serves as a guideline from the sender, as the recipient is free to ignore it.  The issue of enforcement is not a technical problem.

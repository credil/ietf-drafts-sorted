    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a protocol, called kx509, for using Kerberos
      tickets to acquire X.509 certificates. These certificates may be used
      for many of the same purposes as X.509 certificates acquired by other
      means, but if a Kerberos infrastructure already exists then the overhead
      of using kx509 may be much less.</t>

      <t>While not standardized, this protocol is already in use at several
      large organizations, and certificates issued with this protocol are
      recognized by the International Grid Trust Federation.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The two primary ways of providing cryptographically secure
      identification on the Internet are Kerberos tickets <xref
      target="RFC4120"></xref>, and X.509 <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> and
      <xref target="X.509"></xref> certificates.</t>

      <t>In practical IT infrastructure where both are in use, it's highly
      desirable to deploy their support in a way which guarantees they both
      authoritatively refer to the same entities. There is already a
      widely-adopted standard for using X.509 certificates to acquire
      corresponding Kerberos tickets called PKINIT <xref
      target="RFC4556"></xref>. This document describes the kx509 protocol for
      supporting the symmetric operation of acquiring X.509 certificates using
      Kerberos tickets.</t>

      <t>Preparing and reviewing this document exposed a number of issues
      which are discussed in the security considerations. Unfortunately, some
      of them can only be addressed with an incompatible upgrade to this
      protocol. The IETF's Kerberos working group has an expected work item to
      address these issues.</t>

      <t>The International Grid Trust Federation <xref target="IGTF"></xref>
      supports the use of Short Lived Credential Services <xref
      target="SLCS"></xref> as a means to authenticate for resource usage
      based on other, native identity stores which an organization maintains.
      X.509 certificates issued using the kx509 protocol based on a Kerberos
      identity is one of the recognized Credential Services. The certificate
      profile for that use is outside the scope of this RFC, but is described
      in <xref target="GRID-prof"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In normal operation kx509 can be used after a Kerberos
      ticket-granting-ticket (TGT) is acquired, which is most likely during
      user login. First, the client generates a RSA public/private key-pair.
      Next, using the Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket, it acquires a Kerberos
      service ticket for the KCA (Kerberized Certificate Authority), and uses
      this to send the public half of its key-pair. The KCA will decrypt the
      service ticket, verify the integrity of the incoming packet, determine
      the identity of the user, and use the session key to send back a
      corresponding X.509 certificate.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Data">
      <t>The protocol consists of a single request/reply exchange using
      UDP.</t>

      <t>Both the request and the reply packet begin with four bytes of
      version ID information, followed by a DER encoded ASN.1 message. The
      first two bytes of the version ID are reserved. They MUST be set to zero
      when sent, and SHOULD be ignored when received. The third and fourth
      bytes are the major and minor version numbers, respectively. The version
      of the protocol described in this document is designated 2.0, so the
      first four bytes of the packet are 0, 0, 2, 0.</t>

      <t>Incompatible variations of this protocol MUST use a different major
      version number.</t>

      <section title="Request Packet">
        <t>The request consists of a version ID, followed by a DER encoded
        ASN.1 message containing a Kerberos AP_REQ, integrity check data on
        the request, and public key generated by the client. The ASN.1
        encoding is:</t>

        <t></t>

        <figure>
          <artwork type="ASN.1"><![CDATA[KX509Request ::= SEQUENCE {
        ap-req  OCTET STRING,
        pk-hash OCTET STRING,
        pk-key  OCTET STRING
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The ap-req is as described in <xref target="RFC4120"></xref>
        Section 5.5.1.</t>

        <t>The pk-hash is HMAC using SHA-1 as the underlying hash. All 160
        bits are sent. The key used is the Kerberos session key. The data to
        be hashed is the concatenation of <list style="symbols">
            <t>4-byte version ID at the beginning of the packet.</t>

            <t>OCTET STRING of the ap-req.</t>

            <t>OCTET STRING of the pk-key.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The pk-key contains a public key. This key and its corresponding
        private key are generated by the client before contacting the server.
        Implementations of this protocol MUST support RSA keys, in which case
        the key is a DER encoded RSAPublicKey as defined in <xref
        target="RFC3447"></xref>, section A.1.1, and then stored in this octet
        string in the request. Its encoding as an OCTET STRING starts with the
        0x30 byte sequence at the beginning of a DER encoded RSAPublicKey. Use
        of other public-key types is not defined.</t>

        <t>Appendix C shows an example request packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reply Packet">
        <t>The reply consists of a version ID, followed by a DER encoded ASN.1
        message containing an error code, and an optional authentication hash,
        optional certificate, and optional error text. The service SHOULD
        return replies of the same version as the request where possible.</t>

        <t></t>

        <figure>
          <artwork type="ASN.1"><![CDATA[KX509Response ::= SEQUENCE {
        error-code[0]  INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
        hash[1]        OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
        certificate[2] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
        e-text[3]      VisibleString OPTIONAL
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Although the format of the reply contains independently optional
        objects, the server MUST only generate replies with one of the
        following allowed combinations.</t>

        <texttable>

          <c></c>

          <c>e-text</c>
        </texttable>

        <t>The first case is returned when the server successfully generates a
        certificate for the user. The certificate is a DER encoded Certificate
        as defined in <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> Section A, page 116. Its
        encoding as an OCTET STRING starts with the 0x30 byte sequence that is
        at the beginning of a DER encoded Certificate.</t>

        <t>The second case is returned when the server successfully
        authenticates the user and their key, but is unable for some other
        reason to generate a certificate.</t>

        <t>The third case MAY be returned if the server is unable to
        successfully authenticate the user and intends to return some
        unauthenticated information to the client.</t>

        <t>The hash on a response is computed using SHA-1 HMAC as for the
        request.</t>

        <t>The data that is hashed is the concatenation of the following
        things:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>4-byte version ID at the beginning of the packet.</t>

            <t>DER representation of the error-code exclusive of the tag and
            length, if it is present.</t>

            <t>OCTET STRING of the certificate, if it is present.</t>

            <t>VisibleString representation of the e-text exclusive of the tag
            and length, if it is present.</t>
          </list>In other words, the hash is computed on the data in the
        fields which are present exclusive of the overall ASN.1 wrapping.</t>

        <t>The e-text MAY be translated into other character sets for display
        purposes, but the hash is computed on the e-text in its VisibleString
        representation. If the e-text contains NUL characters, the client MAY
        ignore any part of the error message after the first NUL character for
        display purposes.</t>

        <t>As implied by the above table, if the reply does not contain a
        certificate it MUST contain an error message and a non-zero error
        code. Conversely, if a certificate is returned then the error code
        MUST be zero. The server SHOULD use the DEFAULT encoding for a zero
        error-code value by omitting any explicit error-code from the
        reply.</t>

        <t>The defined error codes are as follows:</t>

        <texttable>
          <ttcol>error-code</ttcol>

          <ttcol>Condition</ttcol>

          <ttcol>Example</ttcol>

          <c>1</c>

          <c>Temporary problem with the server</c>

          <c>Server overloaded</c>
        </texttable>

        <t>If a client error is returned, the client SHOULD NOT retry the
        request unless some remedial action is first taken, although if
        error-code 3 is returned, the client MAY retry with other servers
        before giving up.</t>

        <t>If a server error is returned, it is RECOMMENDED that the client
        retry the request with a different server if one is known.</t>

        <t>Since all KCAs serving a Kerberos realm are intended to be
        equivalent, in accordance with <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> Section
        4.1.2.2, the certificates returned from different KCAs serving the
        same Kerberos realm MUST NOT contain duplicate serial numbers.</t>

        <t>This protocol and document do not address certificate verification
        or path construction. There are no provisions for returning any
        additional certificates which might be needed. Any application using a
        returned certificate must be configured independently to address these
        issues. An incompatible upgrade to this protocol will provide options
        to address this issue.</t>

        <t>The returned certificate MUST identify the Kerberos client
        principal from the ap-req in the original KX509Request in the subject
        of the cert, or in a subjectAltName extension. The identification MUST
        be unique within the organization's deployed infrastructure. It is
        RECOMMENDED that a subjectAltName extension be included of type
        id-pkinit-san as described in <xref target="RFC4556"></xref> Section
        3.2.2. Note that the id-pkinit-san is simply a standard representation
        of a Kerberos principal, and has no other implications with respect to
        PKINIT.</t>

        <t>Other extensions MAY be added according to local policy.</t>

        <t>Appendix C shows an example reply packet.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Operation">
      <t>Absent errors, the protocol consists of a single request, sent via
      UDP, and a single reply, also sent via UDP.</t>

      <t>There is no special provision for requests or replies which exceed
      the allowable size of a UDP packet. Also some implementations have
      imposed hard size limits which are smaller than a typical UDP MTU, and
      will limit the use of extensions and the supportable key size. Even
      without hard limits, if the request or reply exceeds the MTU size of a
      UDP packet for the infrastructure in use, then the reliability of the
      exchange will decrease significantly.</t>

      <t>For &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Kerberos ap-req structures, and
      &ldquo;normal&rdquo; X.509 certificates, this is unlikely unless the
      Kerberos service ticket contains large amounts of authorization data.
      For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that service tickets for the KCA be
      issued without authorization data. If the KCA performs authorization, it
      should do so by other means.</t>

      <t>Before constructing the request, the client must know the canonical
      name(s) and port(s) of the server(s) to contact. It MAY determine them
      by looking up the service's SRV record as described in<xref
      target="RFC2782"></xref>. The entry to be used is _kca._udp.<spanx
      style="emph">realm</spanx>, where <spanx style="emph">realm</spanx> is
      the Kerberos realm, used as part of the DNS name.</t>

      <t>The client has to acquire a service ticket in order to construct the
      ap-req for the service. Conventionally, the Kerberos service principal
      name to use for this service has a first component of "kca_service".
      Absent local configuration or other external knowledge of the correct
      principal to use, the second and final component is conventionally the
      canonical name of the KCA server being contacted, and the realm of the
      principal is determined following normal Kerberos domain to realm
      mapping conventions, as discussed in <xref target="RFC4120"></xref>
      Section 1.3.</t>

      <t>When the server receives a request, it MUST verify the following
      properties of the request before issuing a certificate:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The AP-REQ can be decoded and is not expired.</t>

          <t>If the request uses cross-realm authentication, then it satisfies
          the requirements of local policy and <xref target="RFC4120"></xref>
          Sections 1.2 and 2.7.</t>

          <t>The request's hash is valid.</t>
        </list>The server SHOULD make other sanity checks, such as a minimum
      public key length, to the extent feasible.</t>

      <t>The server MAY decline to respond to an erroneous request. If it does
      not receive a response a client MAY retry its request, but the client
      SHOULD wait at least one second before doing so.</t>

      <t>The client MUST verify any hash in the reply, and MUST NOT use any
      certificate in a reply whose hash does not verify. The client MAY
      display the e-text if the hash is absent or does not verify, but SHOULD
      indicate the message is not authenticated.</t>

                      not meet the registry requirements.

      <t>The GSSAPI/Kerberos/SASL service name currently in use for this
      protocol is "kca_service". This does not meet the naming requirements
      for IANA's GSSAPI/Kerberos/SASL service name registry, so no
      registration is requested. The conflict between the conventional service
      name and the registry rules is expected to be addressed in a future
      version of this protocol. Appropriate registrations will be requested at
      that time.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The only encrypted information in the protocol is that used by
      Kerberos itself. The considerations for any Kerberized service apply
      here.</t>

      <t>The public key in the request is sent in the clear, and without any
      guarantees that the requester actually possesses the corresponding
      private key. Therefore the only appropriate uses of the returned
      certificate are those where the identity of the requester is
      unimportant, or the subsequent use independently guarantees that the
      user possesses the private key. This issue is expected to be addressed
      in a future version of this protocol.</t>

      <t>For example, if the kx509-issued certificate is used for a digital
      signature in a way which does not independently demonstrate
      proof-of-possession of the private key, then an eavesdropper could
      request their own valid certificate via kx509 and claim to have
      originated material signed by the legitimate, original requester. <xref
      target="RFC4211"></xref>, Appendix C contains a more detailed discussion
      of why proof-of-possession is important.</t>

      <t>An example which should be safe is initial client authentication with
      TLS <xref target="RFC5246"></xref> connections. If a client certificate
      is used then a Certificate Verify message (Section 7.4.8 of that RFC) is
      added to the handshake exchange. It includes a signature of the
      handshake messages to that point. Those messages depend on data known
      only to the client and server ends of the specific connection, so
      computing the signature proves possession of the private key. This
      application was the original intended use case for kx509.</t>

      <t>Some information, such as the public key and certificate, is
      transmitted in the clear but (as the name implies) were generally
      intended to be publicly available. However their visibility could still
      raise privacy concerns. The hash is used to protect their integrity.</t>

      <t>The policies for issuing Kerberos tickets and X.509 certificates are
      usually expressed very differently. An implementation of this protocol
      should not provide a mechanism for bypassing ticket or certificate
      policies.</t>

      <t>In particular, if the issued certificate can be used with PKINIT,
      this authentication loop SHOULD NOT bypass policy limits for either
      X.509 certificates or Kerberos tickets.</t>

      <t>X.509 certificates are usually issued with considerably longer
      validity times than Kerberos tickets. Care should be taken that the
      issued certificate is not valid for longer than the intended policy
      should allow. Note that <xref target="RFC4556"></xref> Section 3.2.3.1
      REQUIRES that the lifetime of an issued ticket not exceed the lifetime
      of the predecessor certificate. By analogy it is RECOMMENDED that the
      lifetime of an issued certificate not exceed the lifetime of the
      predecessor Kerberos ticket unless the implications with respect to
      local policy and supporting infrastructure are clearly understood and
      allow it.</t>

             title="Certificate Cacheing and Deployment Considerations">
      <t>As noted in the Security Considerations section, the functional
      lifetime of the acquired X.509 certificate should usually match the
      lifetime of its predecessor Kerberos ticket. Therefore, it is likely
      that X.509 certificates issued with this protocol should be deleted when
      the supporting Kerberos tickets are deleted. That makes the Kerberos
      ticket cache a reasonable location to store the certificate (and its
      private key).</t>

      <t>On the other hand applications, such as web browsers, probably expect
      certificates in different stores.</t>

      <t>A widely used solution to this dichotomy is to implement a PKCS11
      library which supports the KX509-acquired credentials. The credentials
      remain stored in the Kerberos credentials cache, but full PKI
      functionality is still available via a standard interface for PKI
      credentials.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Historic Extensions">
      <t>This appendix documents extensions to the kx509 protocol which are
      either no longer in use, or are expected to be dropped.</t>

      <t>A subjectAltName othername extension of type kcaAuthRealm (OID value
      1.3.6.1.4.1.250.42.1) is frequently used to include the client's realm
      as an ASN.1 octet string.</t>

      <t>The Microsoft-defined userPrincipalName has frequently been used for
      the same purpose as the id-pkinit-san.</t>

      <t>The historic implementations of this protocol included provisions for
      DSA keys in place of RSA. DSA does not appear to be in use. A future
      version of this protocol will use a standard certificate request
      structure which will provide algorithm agility.</t>

      <t>The historic implementations of this protocol allowed an optional
      client-version field (at the end of the request) of type VisibleString.
      If present, the KCA copied it into the issued certificate as an
      extension with the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.42.2. This feature does not
      appear to be in use.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Example Exchange">
      <t>The request and reply are from the same exchange. The Ethernet, IP,
      and UDP headers, and the 4-byte version string at the beginning of the
      request and reply packets are all omitted. Only the ASN.1-encoded
      portions are shown.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The title, a word in the abstract, and the reference to the IETF
          Kerberos working group were changed to make it clearer that this is
          not a standards-track document.</t>

          <t>Added Appendix C, to clarify the ASN.1 encoding, and specify the
          byte string that begins the ASN.1 OCTET STRING encoding of
          certificates.</t>

          <t>Removed the request for IANA registration of the
          GSSAPI/Kerberos/SASL name, since the service name registry does not
          allow the form of name actually in use. Add an IANA registration
          request for the conventional port number.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The list of possible issues was deleted. Either appropriate
          comments have been added to the text, or the issue is mentioned as
          something to be addressed in an incompatible future version of this
          protocol.</t>

          <t>Clarified the hash computations in sections 2.1 and 2.2.</t>

          <t>Clarified the procedure for determining the Kerberos principal of
          the KCA in section 3.</t>

          <t>Clarified the discussion of the "proof-of-possession" issue in
          the Security Considerations with appropriate references.</t>

      <t>Changes from Draft -02 to Draft -03:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The abstract was expanded.</t>

          <t>Additional information was provided on traditional UDP size
          restrictions and their effect on reliability and key sizes in
          section 3.</t>

          <t>The updates to the security considerations for digital signature
          usage were incomplete, and have been rewritten.</t>

          <t>Information on an optional client version feature (which does not
          appear to be actually in use) was added to the request ASN.1, and
          Appendix B, and the title of the appendix changed.</t>

          <t>As before some minor changes to wording were made for clarity,
          but are not believed to have changed the meaning.</t>
        </list>Changes from Draft -01 to Draft -02:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The retry behavior was made slightly less specific.</t>

          <t>The traditionally used SAN extensions were moved to a new
          appendix, leaving only the id-pkinit-san as the RECOMMENDED SAN.</t>

          <t>The absolute prohibition against digital signatures in the
          Security Considerations section was relaxed since there are
          legitimate situations where a signature based on the KX509
          certificate is still useful. (E.g. integrity protection where the
          actual signing identity is not important.)</t>

          <t>Reference to TAGPMA in the abstract was replaced with a reference
          to its parent, the International Grid Trust Federation, and more
          detailed informative references were expanded in the
          Introduction.</t>

          <t>Assorted other wording changes were made for clarity, but are not
          believed to have changed the meaning.</t>

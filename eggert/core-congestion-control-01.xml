The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a simple, low-overhead, UDP-based protocol for use with resource-constrained IP networks and nodes. CoAP defines a simple technique to individually retransmit lost messages, but has no other congestion control mechanisms.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
	<t>
The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> is a simple, low-overhead, UDP-based protocol for use with resource-constrained IP networks and nodes. 
	</t>
	<t>
CoAP defines two kinds of interactions between end-points:
	<list style="numbers">
	<t>a client/server interaction model, where request or notify messages initiate a transaction with a server, which may send a response to the client with a matching transaction ID</t>

	<t>an asynchronous subscribe/notify interaction model, where a server can send notify messages to a client about a resource which the client has subscribed to
	</t>
	</list>

CoAP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <xref target="RFC0768"/> to transmit these messages. For reliable messages, i.e., messages for which a delivery confirmation is required, CoAP defines a simple mechanism to individually retransmit such "confirmable" messages for which no delivery acknowledgement was received. This mechanism uses an exponentially backed-off timer to schedule a fixed number of re-transmission attempts.
	</t>
	
	<t>
This document argues that although this retransmission mechanism is a required first step to implement congestion control for CoAP, it alone is not sufficient to alleviate network overload in all conditions. <xref target="background"/> gives a short summary of Internet congestion control principles, and <xref target="proposal"/> presents some simple strawman proposals that attempt to complement the current message retransmission mechanism in CoAP.
	</t>	
</section>


<section title="Discussion of Internet Congestion Control Principles" anchor="background">
	<t>
<xref target="RFC2914"/> describes the best current practices for congestion control in the Internet, and requires that Internet communication employ congestion control mechanisms. Because UDP itself provides no congestion control mechanisms, it is up to the applications and application-layer protocols that use UDP for Internet communication to employ suitable mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and establish a degree of fairness. CoAP is one such application-layer protocol.
	</t>
	<t>
<xref target="RFC2914"/> identifies two major reasons why congestion control mechanisms are critical for the stable operation of the Internet:

	<list style="numbers">
		<t>
The prevention of congestion collapse, i.e., a state where an increase in network load results in a decrease in useful work done by the network. 
		</t>
		<t>
The establishment of a degree of fairness, i.e., allowing multiple flows to share the capacity of a path reasonably equitably. 
		</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	<t>
Bulk transfers cause the overwhelming majority of the bytes on the Internet, and the traditional congestion control mechanisms used for bulk transfers are engineered to saturate the network without driving it into congestive collapse. Fairness between flows is an important secondary consideration when the network operates around the saturation point, so that new flows are not disadvantaged compared to established flows, and can obtain a reasonable share of the capacity quickly.
	</t>
	<t>
The environments that CoAP targets are IP networks, although more resource-constrained ones than the "big-I" Internet. This does not eliminate the need for end-point-based congestion control! If anything, the environments that CoAP will be deployed in have fewer capabilities for network provisioning, queuing and queue management, traffic engineering and capacity allocation, which are among the techniques that can sometimes offset the need for end-to-end congestion control to some degree. 
	</t>
	<t>
However, the environments that CoAP targets are sufficiently different from the "big-I" Internet so that the motivations for congestion control from <xref target="RFC2914"/> should probably be weighted differently. CoAP networks will not be used for bulk data transfers and CoAP nodes will not need to use a significant fraction of the capacity of a path to provide a useful service. (In fact, they are often too resource-constrained to do so in the first place.) Under normal operation, a CoAP network will be mostly idle, which means that fairness between the transmissions of different CoAP nodes is not a large issue. A CoAP congestion control mechanism can hence focus on preventing congestion collapse, i.e., preventing situations where the mount of useful work done approaches zero as network load increases. This is a much more tractable problem given the specific conditions of CoAP environments.
	</t>
	<t>
The current IETF congestion control mechanisms, such as TCP <xref target="RFC5681"/> or TFRC <xref target="RFC5348"/>, all focus on determining a "safe" sending rate for a bulk transfer, i.e., for a single flow of many packets between a sender and destination where many packets are in flight at any given time. They measure the path characteristics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and packet loss rate, by monitoring the ongoing transfer and use this information to adjust the sending rate of the flow during the transmission.
	</t>
	<t>
This approach is not feasible for CoAP. The infrequent request/response interaction that CoAP supports does not generate sufficient data about the path characteristics to drive a traditional congestion control loop, even if the notion of "a flow" to a destination is extended from "one CoAP transaction" to "a sequence of CoAP transactions". Further complications can arise for CoAP deployments that involve low-capacity, low-power radio links that can cause highly variable path characteristics that are more challenging to adapt to than traditional "big-I" Internet paths. This approach is also not applicable to multicast transmissions, which may see frequent use in some CoAP deployments.
	</t>
	<t>
<xref target="RFC5405"/> documents the IETF's current best practices for using UDP for unicast communication in the Internet. It provides guidance on topics such as message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal and congestion control. Section 3.1.2 of <xref target="RFC5405"/>, which focuses on congestion control for low data-volume applications, is especially relevant to CoAP. 
	</t>
	<t>
Section 3.1.2 of <xref target="RFC5405"/> acknowledges that the traditional IETF congestion control mechanisms are not applicable for low data-volume application protocols such as CoAP. Instead, it recommends that such application protocols:

	<list style="symbols">
	<t>maintain an estimate of the RTT for any destination with which they communicate, or assume a conservative fixed value of 3 seconds when no RTT estimate can be obtained (e.g., unidirectional communication)</t>
	<t>control their transmission behavior by not sending on average more than one UDP datagram per RTT to a destination</t>
	<t>detect packet loss and exponentially back their retransmission timer off when a loss event occurs</t>
	<t>employ congestion control for both directions of a bi-directional communication</t>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
CoAP follows some of these guidelines already. At the moment, it uses a fixed value of 2 seconds for its retransmission timer for both requests and responses, which although somewhat shorter than the recommended value in <xref target="RFC5405"/> is likely appropriate for many of its deployment scenarios. CoAP also uses exponential back-off for its retransmission timer.
	</t>
	<t>
This alone, however, does not result in a complete congestion control mechanism for CoAP. <xref target="proposal"/> defines an experimental complement to the current CoAP mechanism described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>.
	</t>
</section>


<section title="CoAP Congestion Control" anchor="proposal">
	<t>
This section proposes several congestion control techniques for CoAP that are intended to improve its ability to prevent congestion collapse. At the moment, these techniques are described with the intent of encouraging experimentation with such proposals in CoAP simulations and experimental testbed deployments. Of particular interest are mechanism requiring little computation and state, i.e., mechanisms that can be implemented in resource-constrained nodes without much overhead. 
	</t>	

<section title="Retransmissions" anchor="timers">
	<t>
	CoAP already defines a simple retransmission scheme with exponential back-off, where messages that have not been responded to in RESPONSE_TIMEOUT are retransmitted, followed by doubling RESPONSE_TIMEOUT. Up to MAX_RETRANSMIT retransmission attempts are made. (At the moment, <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> defines RESPONSE_TIMEOUT to be 2 seconds and MAX_RETRANSMIT to be four attempts.) As stated above, although RESPONSE_TIMEOUT is somewhat shorter than what <xref target="RFC5405"/> recommends, the shorter value is likely to not cause large issues in many deployments that CoAP targets. 	
	</t>
	<t>
However, using a fixed value for RESPONSE_TIMEOUT instead of basing it on the measured RTT to a destination has some minor drawbacks. CoAP may be used in deployments where the path RTTs can approach the currently defined RESPONSE_TIMEOUT of 2 seconds, such as Internet deployments involving GSM or 3G links, or cases where preparing a response can involve significant computation or where it otherwise incurs delays, such as long sleep cycles at the receiver. Fixed timeouts that are too short can cause spurious retransmissions, i.e., unnecessary retransmissions in cases where either the request or the response are still in transit. Spurious retransmissions, especially persistent ones, waste resources.
	</t>
	<t>
This section therefore proposes that CoAP deployments experiment with maintaining an estimate of the RTT for any destination with which they (frequently) communicate. Specifically, it is suggested that deployments experiment with the algorithm specified in <xref target="RFC2988"/> to compute a smoothed RTT (SRTT) estimate, and compute RESPONSE_TIMEOUT in the same way <xref target="RFC2988"/> computes RTO.
	</t>
	<t>
This suggestion unfortunately does require maintaining per-destination state at the sender, which may be undesirable. The amount of required state can be reduced by maintaining a single "upper bound" RTT measurement across all destinations. The downside here is that retransmissions may be delayed longer than they would be with per-destination state; the upside is that multicast messages are supported.
	</t>
	<t>
A second suggestion is to experiment with a longer RESPONSE_TIMEOUT, such as 3 seconds or longer, which is what <xref target="RFC5405"/> recommends, in order to determine if there are significant drawbacks or whether this default value could be lengthened.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Aggregate Congestion Control" anchor="aggregate">
	<t>
Traditional Internet congestion control algorithms control the sending rate of a single flow. When a node establishes multiple, parallel flows, their congestion control loops run (mostly) independently of one another. Interactions between the control loops of parallel flows are (mostly) indirect, e.g., a rate increase of one flow may cause packet loss and an eventual rate decrease to another.
	</t>
	<t>
CoAP "flows", i.e., sequences of infrequent CoAP transactions between the same two nodes, do not require much more per-flow congestion control than a retransmission scheme that reduces the rate (increases the back-off) of a flow under loss, and a (low) cap on the number of allowed outstanding requests to a destination. (<xref target="RFC5405"/> recommends "on average not more than one" outstanding transaction to a given destination.)
	</t>
	<t>
On the other hand, CoAP applications may potentially want to initiate many transactions with different nodes at the same time. Allowing CoAP applications to initiate an unlimited number of parallel transactions gives them the means for causing overload, and depends on application-level measures to detect and correctly mitigate this failure. Because each transaction only consumes a very limited amount of resources, it is arguably more important to control the total outstanding number of transactions, compared to controlling the rate at which each individual one is being (re)transmitted. The CoAP spec <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> does currently not impose any limit on how many parallel transactions to different nodes an end-point may have outstanding.
	</t>
	<t>
Given the importance of preventing congestion collapse, this document argues that the CoAP protocol should specify a common mechanism for congestion controlling the aggregate traffic a CoAP node sends into the network. In other words, the CoAP stack should locally drop application-generated messages under overload situations (or indicate to applications that at the moment, no transmission is permissible), rather than attempting to send them into the network, irrespective of the destination.
	</t>
	<t>
One proposal is to implement a simple windowing algorithm. In this mechanism, a CoAP node has a certain number of "transmission credits" available during a time interval. Sending one CoAP message consumes one transmission credit, independent of which destination it is being sent to. If all transmission credits have been used up during a time interval, the CoAP node drops any additional messages that the applications attempt to send during the remainder of the time interval (or it prevents applications from generating the messages in the first place). At the end of a time interval, the CoAP node determines whether acknowledgments have been received for all "confirmable" messages it has sent within the time interval. If this is the case, the CoAP node increases the number of transmission credits by one for the following time interval. If acknowledgments fail to arrive for some of the "confirmable" messages sent during the time interval, the number of transmission credits is cut in half for the next interval.
	</t>
	<t>
The description above leaves several questions unanswered. These include the length of the time interval and whether it is fixed or adapted over time, whether an increase by one and a reduction by half are the correct parameters for the proposed AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease) scheme, whether the decrease should be proportional to the loss rate, how non-confirmable and multicast messages are handled, and others.
	</t>
	<t>
At the moment, this document does not attempt to answer these questions. Instead, it encourages simulations and implementations to explore the design space, and also consider other non-windowing approaches.
	</t>
		
</section>

<section title="Explicit Congestion Notification" anchor="ecn">
	<t>
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"/> is an extension to IP that allows routers to inform end nodes when they approach congestion by setting a bit in the IP header. The receiver of a message echoes this bit to the sender, which reacts as if packet loss had occurred for the flow.
	</t>
	<t>
Deployment of ECN can reduce overall packet loss, because senders can react to congestion early, i.e., before packet loss occurs. This is especially attractive  in resource-constrained environments, because retransmissions can be avoided, which conserves resources.
	</t>
	<t>
If CoAP uses an aggregate congestion control mechanism such as described in  <xref target="aggregate"/>, it will reduce the amount of transmission credits for the next time interval when some of the responses received had the ECN bit set. (Other reactions to ECN markings may be possible.)
	</t>
	<t>
Whether ECN support is possible in CoAP deployments remains to be investigated, because ECN usage requires a negotiation handshake (can potentially be avoided if support is made mandatory for CoAP deployments) and because routers need to support ECN marking. At this point, simulations attempting to quantify the benefits may therefore be easiest to obtain in order to understand which benefits ECN brings to CoAP.
	</t>

</section>

<section title="Multicast Considerations" anchor="multicast">
	<t>
CoAP requests may be multicast, and result in several replies from different end-points, potentially consuming much more resource capacity for the request and response transmissions than a single unicast transaction. It can therefore be argued that the sending multicast requests should be more conservatively controlled than the sending of unicast requests.
	</t>
	<t>
CoAP already acknowledges this to some degree by not retransmitting multicast requests at the CoAP level. Unfortunately, CoAP currently has no means for preventing an application from doing application-level retransmissions of multicast requests. Given that the prevention of congestion collapse is important, such a mechanism should be added.
	</t>
	<t>
The aggregate congestion control proposal in <xref target="aggregate"/> puts a cap on the number of transmissions allowed during a time interval, including multicast requests. It is currently unclear whether additional means are required for CoAP deployments that make heavy use of multicast. As before, experimentation is encouraged to understand the problem space. </t>

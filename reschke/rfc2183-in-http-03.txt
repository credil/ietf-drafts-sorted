           Use of the Content-Disposition Header Field in the
                   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Abstract

   HTTP/1.1 defines the Content-Disposition response header field, but
   points out that it is not part of the HTTP/1.1 Standard.  This
   specification takes over the definition and registration of Content-
   Disposition, as used in HTTP, and clarifies internationalization
   aspects.

Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

   This specification is expected to replace the definition of Content-
   Disposition in the HTTP/1.1 specification, as currently revised by
   the IETF HTTPbis working group.  See also
   <http://www3.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/123>.

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP           August 2010


1.  Introduction

   HTTP/1.1 defines the Content-Disposition response header field in
   Section 19.5.1 of [RFC2616], but points out that it is not part of
   the HTTP/1.1 Standard (Section 15.5):

      Content-Disposition is not part of the HTTP standard, but since it
      is widely implemented, we are documenting its use and risks for
      implementors.

   This specification takes over the definition and registration of
   Content-Disposition, as used in HTTP.  Based on interoperability
   testing with existing User Agents, it fully defines a profile of the
   features defined in the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
   variant ([RFC2183]) of the header field, and also clarifies
   internationalization aspects.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the augmented BNF notation defined in Section
   2.1 of [RFC2616], including its rules for linear whitespace (LWS).

3.  Header Field Definition

   The Content-Disposition response header field is used to convey
   additional information about how to process the response payload, and
   also can be used to attach additional metadata, such as the filename.

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP           August 2010


3.1.  Grammar

     content-disposition = "Content-Disposition" ":"
                            disposition-type *( ";" disposition-parm )

     disposition-type    = "inline" | "attachment" | disp-ext-type
                         ; case-insensitive
     disp-ext-type       = token

     disposition-parm    = filename-parm | disp-ext-parm

     filename-parm       = "filename" "=" value
                         | "filename*" "=" ext-value

     disp-ext-parm       = token "=" value
                         | ext-token "=" ext-value
     ext-token           = <the characters in token, followed by "*">

   Defined in [RFC2616]:

     token       = <token, defined in [RFC2616], Section 2.2>
     value       = <value, defined in [RFC2616], Section 3.6>

   Defined in [RFC5987]:

     ext-value   = <ext-value, defined in [RFC5987], Section 3.2>

3.2.  Disposition Type

   If the disposition type matches "attachment" (case-insensitively),
   this indicates that the user agent should not display the response,
   but directly enter a "save as..." dialog.

   On the other hand, if it matches "inline" (case-insensitively), this
   implies default processing.

   Other disposition types SHOULD be handled the same way as
   "attachment" (see also [RFC2183], Section 2.8).

3.3.  Disposition Parameter: 'Filename'

   The parameters "filename" and "filename*", to be matched case-
   insensitively, provide information on how to construct a filename for
   storing the message payload.

   Depending on the disposition type, this information might be used
   right away (in the "save as..." interaction caused for the
   "attachment" disposition type), or later on (for instance, when the

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP           August 2010


   user decides to save the contents of the current page being
   displayed).

   "filename" and "filename*" behave the same, except that "filename*"
   uses the encoding defined in [RFC5987], allowing the use of
   characters not present in the ISO-8859-1 character set
   ([ISO-8859-1]).  When both "filename" and "filename*" are present, a
   recipient SHOULD pick "filename*" and ignore "filename" - this will
   make it possible to send the same header value to clients that do not
   support "filename*".

   It is essential that user agents treat the specified filename as
   advisory only, thus be very careful in extracting the desired
   information.  In particular:

   o  When the value contains path separator characters, all but the
      last segment SHOULD be ignored.  This prevents unintentional
      overwriting of well-known file system location (such as "/etc/
      passwd").

   o  Many platforms do not use Internet Media Types ([RFC2046]) to hold
      type information in the file system, but rely on filename
      extensions instead.  Trusting the server-provided file extension
      could introduce a privilege escalation when later on the file is
      opened locally (consider ".exe").  Thus, recipients need to ensure
      that a file extension is used that is safe, optimally matching the
      media type of the received payload.

   o  Other aspects recipients need to be aware of are names that have a
      special meaning in the filesystem or in shell commands, such as
      "." and "..", "~", "|", and also device names.

3.4.  Disposition Parameter: Extensions

   To enable future extensions, unknown parameters SHOULD be ignored
   (see also [RFC2183], Section 2.8).

3.5.  Extensibility

   Note that Section 9 of [RFC2183] defines IANA registries both for
   disposition types and disposition parameters.  This registry is
   shared by different protocols using Content-Disposition, such as MIME
   and HTTP.  Therefore, not all registered values may make sense in the
   context of HTTP.

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP           August 2010


4.  Examples

   Direct UA to show "save as" dialog, with a filename of "foo.html":

   Content-Disposition: Attachment; filename=foo.html

   Direct UA to behave as if the Content-Disposition header field wasn't
   present, but to remember the filename "foo.html" for a subsequent
   save operation:

   Content-Disposition: INLINE; FILENAME= "foo.html"

   Direct UA to show "save as" dialog, with a filename of "an example":

   Content-Disposition: Attachment; Filename*=UTF-8'en'an%20example

   Note that this example uses the extended encoding defined in
   [RFC5987] to specify that the natural language of the filename is
   English, and also to encode the space character which is not allowed
   in the token production.

   Direct UA to show "save as" dialog, with a filename containing the
   Unicode character U+20AC (EURO SIGN):

   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*= UTF-8''%e2%82%ac%20rates

   Here, the encoding defined in [RFC5987] is also used to encode the
   non-ISO-8859-1 character.

   Same as above, but adding the "filename" parameter for compatibility
   with user agents not implementing RFC 5987:

   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="EURO rates";
                                    filename*=utf-8''%e2%82%ac%20rates

   Note: as of August 2010, many user agents unfortunately did not
   properly handle unexpected parameters, and some that implement RFC
   5987 did not pick the extended parameter when both were present.

5.  Internationalization Considerations

   The "filename*" parameter (Section 3.3), using the encoding defined
   in [RFC5987], allows the server to transmit characters outside the
   ISO-8859-1 character set, and also to optionally specify the language
   in use.

   Future parameters might also require internationalization, in which
   case the same encoding can be used.

6.  Security Considerations

   Using server-supplied information for constructing local filenames
   introduces many risks.  These are summarized in Section 3.3.

   Furthermore, implementers also ought to be aware of the Security
   Considerations applying to HTTP (see Section 15 of [RFC2616]), and
   also the parameter encoding defined in [RFC5987] (see Section 5).

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registry for Disposition Values and Parameter

   This specification does not introduce any changes to the registration
   procedures for disposition values and parameters that are defined in
   Section 9 of [RFC2183].

7.2.  Header Field Registration

   This document updates the definition of the Content-Disposition HTTP
   header field in the permanent HTTP header field registry (see
   [RFC3864]).

   Header field name:  Content-Disposition

   Applicable protocol:  http

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP           August 2010


Appendix A.  Changes from the RFC 2616 Definition

   Compared to Section 19.5.1 of [RFC2616], the following normative
   changes reflecting actual implementations have been made:

   o  According to RFC 2616, the disposition type "attachment" only
      applies to content of type "application/octet-stream".  This
      restriction has been removed, because user agents in practice do
      not check the content type, and it also discourages properly
      declaring the media type.

   o  RFC 2616 only allows "quoted-string" for the filename parameter.
      This would be an exceptional parameter syntax, and also doesn't
      reflect actual use.

   o  The definition for the disposition type "inline" ([RFC2183],
      Section 2.1) has been re-added with a suggestion for its
      processing.

   o  This specification requires support for the extended parameter
      encoding defined in [RFC5987].

Appendix B.  Differences compared to RFC 2183

   Section 2 of [RFC2183] defines several additional disposition
   parameters: "creation-date", "modification-date", "quoted-date-time",
   and "size".  These do not appear to be implemented by any user agent,
   thus have been omitted from this specification.

Appendix C.  Alternative Approaches to Internationalization

   By default, HTTP header field parameters cannot carry characters
   outside the ISO-8859-1 ([ISO-8859-1]) character encoding (see
   [RFC2616], Section 2.2).  For the "filename" parameter, this of
   course is an unacceptable restriction.

   Unfortunately, user agent implementers have not managed to come up
   with an interoperable approach, although the IETF Standards Track
   specifies exactly one solution ([RFC2231], clarified and profiled for
   HTTP in [RFC5987]).

   For completeness, the sections below describe the various approaches
   that have been tried, and explains how they are inferior to the RFC
   5987 encoding used in this specification.

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP           August 2010


C.1.  RFC 2047 Encoding

   RFC 2047 defines an encoding mechanism for header fields, but this
   encoding is not supposed to be used for header field parameters - see
   Section 5 of [RFC2047]:

      An 'encoded-word' MUST NOT appear within a 'quoted-string'.

      ...

      An 'encoded-word' MUST NOT be used in parameter of a MIME Content-
      Type or Content-Disposition field, or in any structured field body
      except within a 'comment' or 'phrase'.

   In practice, some user agents implement the encoding, some do not
   (exposing the encoded string to the user), and some get confused by
   it.

C.2.  Percent Encoding

   Some user agents accept percent encoded ([RFC3986], Section 2.1)
   sequences of characters encoded using the UTF-8 ([RFC3629]) character
   encoding.

   In practice, this is hard to use because those user agents that do
   not support it will display the escaped character sequence to the
   user.

   Furthermore, the first user agent to implement this did choose the
   encoding based on local settings; thus making it very hard to use in
   multi-lingual environments.

C.3.  Encoding Sniffing

   Some user agents inspect the value (which defaults to ISO-8859-1) and
   switch to UTF-8 when it seems to be more likely to be the correct
   interpretation.

   As with the approaches above, this is not interoperable and
   furthermore risks misinterpreting the actual value.

C.4.  Implementations

   Unfortunately, as of August 2010, neither the encoding defined in
   RFCs 2231 and 5789, nor any of the alternate approaches discussed
   above was implemented interoperably.  Thus, this specification
   recommends the approach defined in RFC 5987, which at least has the
   advantage of actually being specified properly.

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP           August 2010


E.1.  quoted

   In Section 3.1:

   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2010-08-23): Can value be quoted-pair
   as well?  It is "value" only in RFC 2183, but "quoted-string" only in
   2616.  UAs seem to handle quoted-strings, although some have trouble
   unescaping backslashes.

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2010-08-24): Actually, "value" is
   "token" or "quoted-string", both in RFC 2616 and RFC 2183 (by
   reference to RFC 2045).  The only problem is that RFC 2616 uses
   quoted-string instead of value in the definition for the filename
   parameter.  This is a bug in 2616.

   Resolution (2010-08-24): Note the change in "Changes from the RFC
   2616 Definition".

E.2.  asciivsiso

   In Section 3.3:

   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2010-08-24): We should be consistent
   about what RFC 2616 defaults to (ASCII vs ISO-8859-1).

   Resolution (2010-08-30): Say "ISO-8859-1", and also make the ISO-
   8859-1 ref normative.

E.3.  deplboth

   In Section 4:

   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2010-08-24): Add an example that uses
   both "filename" and "filename*" and mention current UA behavior.

   Resolution (2010-08-27): Add the example, and mention the issues with
   it.

E.4.  registry

   In Section 7.1:

Internet-Draft         Content-Disposition in HTTP           August 2010


   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2010-08-23): The registry technically
   is for the MIME header, but has been used for C-D in other protocols
   already.  What's missing are instructions that new registrations
   should state which protocol they're for.  Do we want to attempt to
   modify the registry?

   Resolution (2010-08-30): Add a section about extensibility explaining
   the existing registries.

E.5.  docfallback

   In Section C.4:

   Type: edit

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2010-08-30): Describe the
   implementation quality of the fallback behavior.

   Resolution (2010-08-30): Done.

Appendix F.  Open issues (to be removed by RFC Editor prior to
             publication)

F.1.  edit

   Type: edit

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2009-10-16): Umbrella issue for
   editorial fixes/enhancements.

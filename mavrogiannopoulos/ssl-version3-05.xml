   This document specifies Version 3.0 of the Secure Sockets Layer
   (SSL V3.0) protocol, a security protocol that provides
   communications privacy over the Internet.  The protocol allows
   client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed
   to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.
         </t>
      </abstract>

<note title='Foreword'>
  <t>
  Although the SSL 3.0 protocol is a widely implemented protocol and a
  pioneer in secure communications protocols, it was never formally
  published by IETF, except in several expired internet-drafts. 
  This allowed no easy referencing to the protocol. Despite the fact it has
  been made obsolete today by the TLS protocols we believe a stable reference 
  to the original document should exist and for that reason, this document describes 
  what is known as the last published version of the SSL 3.0 protocol. 
  That is the November 18, 1996 version of the protocol.
  </t>
  <t>
  There were no changes to the original document other than trivial
  editorial changes and the addition of a "Security considerations" section. 
  However portions of the original 
  draft that no longer apply were not included. 
  Such are the "Patent statement" section, the
  "Reserved ports assignment" section and the cipher-suite registrator
  note in the "The CipherSuite" section. The "US export rules" discussed in
  the document do not apply today but are kept intact to provide context for
  decisions taken in protocol design.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
        <t>
   The primary goal of the SSL Protocol is to provide privacy and
   reliability between two communicating applications.  The protocol
   is composed of two layers.  At the lowest level, layered on top of
   some reliable transport protocol (e.g., TCP<xref target="RFC0793"/>), is the SSL
   Record Protocol.  The SSL Record Protocol is used for encapsulation
   of various higher level protocols.  One such encapsulated protocol,
   the SSL Handshake Protocol, allows the server and client to
   authenticate each other and to negotiate an encryption algorithm
   and cryptographic keys before the application protocol transmits or
   receives its first byte of data.  One advantage of SSL is that it
   is application protocol independent.  A higher level protocol can
   layer on top of the SSL Protocol transparently.  The SSL protocol
   provides connection security that has three basic properties:

   <list style='symbols'>
        <t>The connection is private.  Encryption is used after an
         initial handshake to define a secret key.  Symmetric
         cryptography is used for data encryption (e.g., DES<xref target="DES"/>,
         RC4<xref target="RSADSI"/>, etc.)</t>
        <t>The peer's identity can be authenticated using asymmetric, or
         public key, cryptography (e.g., RSA<xref target="RSA"/>, DSS<xref target="DSS"/>, etc.).
        </t>
        <t>The connection is reliable.  Message transport includes a
         message integrity check using a keyed MAC.  Secure hash
         functions (e.g., SHA, MD5, etc.) are used for MAC
         computations.</t>
    </list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="goals" title="Goals">
<t>
   The goals of SSL Protocol v3.0, in order of their priority,
   are:
	   <list style='numbers'>
		<t>Cryptographic security
		    <list style='empty'>
			<t>SSL should be used to establish a secure
			       connection between two parties.</t>
		    </list>
		</t>
		<t>Interoperability
			<list style='empty'>
				<t>Independent programmers should be able to
				develop applications utilizing SSL 3.0 that
				will then be able to successfully exchange
				cryptographic parameters without knowledge of
				one another's code.</t>
				<t>Note: It is not the case that all instances of SSL (even
				  in the same application domain) will be able to
				  successfully connect.  For instance, if the server
				  supports a particular hardware token, and the client
				  does not have access to such a token, then the
				  connection will not succeed.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>

                    
		<t>Extensibility
		    <list style='empty'>
			<t>SSL seeks to provide a framework into which new
			       public key and bulk encryption methods can be
			       incorporated as necessary.  This will also
			       accomplish two sub-goals: to prevent the need
			       to create a new protocol (and risking the
			       introduction of possible new weaknesses) and to
			       avoid the need to implement an entire new
			       security library.</t>
		    </list>
		</t>     
		<t>Relative efficiency
		   <list style='empty'>
			<t>Cryptographic operations tend to be highly CPU
			       intensive, particularly public key operations.
			       For this reason, the SSL protocol has
			       incorporated an optional session caching scheme
			       to reduce the number of connections that need
			       to be established from scratch.  Additionally,
			       care has been taken to reduce network activity.</t>

<section anchor="goals-document" title="Goals of this document">
<t>
   The SSL Protocol Version 3.0 Specification is intended primarily
   for readers who will be implementing the protocol and those doing
   cryptographic analysis of it.  The spec has been written with this
   in mind, and it is intended to reflect the needs of those two
   groups.  For that reason, many of the algorithm-dependent data
   structures and rules are included in the body of the text (as
   opposed to in an Appendix), providing easier access to them.
</t>
<t>
   This document is not intended to supply any details of service
   definition nor interface definition, although it does cover select
   areas of policy as they are required for the maintenance of solid
   security.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="presentation" title="Presentation language">
<t>
   This document deals with the formatting of data in an external
   representation.  The following very basic and somewhat casually
   defined presentation syntax will be used.  The syntax draws from
   several sources in its structure.  Although it resembles the
   programming language "C" in its syntax and XDR <xref target="RFC1832"/> in both its
   syntax and intent, it would be risky to draw too many parallels.
   The purpose of this presentation language is to document SSL only,
   not to have general application beyond that particular goal.
</t>

<section anchor="bbs" title="Basic block size">
<t>
   The representation of all data items is explicitly specified.  The
   basic data block size is one byte (i.e. 8 bits).  Multiple byte
   data items are concatenations of bytes, from left to right, from
   top to bottom.  From the bytestream a multi-byte item (a numeric in
   the example) is formed (using C notation) by:
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     value = (byte[0] << 8*(n-1)) | (byte[1] << 8*(n-2)) | ...
     | byte[n-1];
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
   This byte ordering for multi-byte values is the commonplace network
   byte order or big endian format.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="miscellaneous" title="Miscellaneous">
<t>
   Comments begin with "/*" and end with "*/".
   Optional components are denoted by enclosing them in "[[ ]]" double
   brackets.
   Single byte entities containing uninterpreted data are of type
   opaque.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="vectors" title="Vectors">
<t>
   A vector (single dimensioned array) is a stream of homogeneous data
   elements.  The size of the vector may be specified at documentation
   time or left unspecified until runtime.  In either case the length
   declares the number of bytes, not the number of elements, in the
   vector.  The syntax for specifying a new type T' that is a fixed
   length vector of type T is
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     T T'[n];
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
   Here T' occupies n bytes in the data stream, where n is a multiple
   of the size of T.  The length of the vector is not included in the
   encoded stream.
</t><t>
   In the following example, Datum is defined to be three consecutive
   bytes that the protocol does not interpret, while Data is three
   consecutive Datum, consuming a total of nine bytes.
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     opaque Datum[3];      /* three uninterpreted bytes */
     Datum Data[9];        /* 3 consecutive 3 byte vectors */
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
   Variable length vectors are defined by specifying a subrange of
   legal lengths, inclusively, using the notation <![CDATA[<floor..ceiling>]]>.
   When encoded, the actual length precedes the vector's contents in
   the byte stream.  The length will be in the form of a number
   consuming as many bytes as required to hold the vector's specified
   maximum (ceiling) length.  A variable length vector with an actual
   length field of zero is referred to as an empty vector.
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     T T'<floor..ceiling>;
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
   In the following example, mandatory is a vector that must contain
   between 300 and 400 bytes of type opaque.  It can never be empty.
   The actual length field consumes two bytes, a uint16, sufficient to
   represent the value 400 (see <xref target="numbers"/>).  On the other hand,
   longer can represent up to 800 bytes of data, or 400 uint16
   elements, and it may be empty.  Its encoding will include a two
   byte actual length field prepended to the vector.
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     opaque mandatory<300..400>;
           /* length field is 2 bytes, cannot be empty */
     uint16 longer<0..800>;
           /* zero to 400 16-bit unsigned integers */
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="numbers" title="Numbers">
<t>
   The basic numeric data type is an unsigned byte (uint8).  All
   larger numeric data types are formed from fixed length series of
   bytes concatenated as described in <xref target="bbs"/> and are also
   unsigned.  The following numeric types are predefined.
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     uint8 uint16[2];
     uint8 uint24[3];
     uint8 uint32[4];
     uint8 uint64[8];
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="enumerateds" title="Enumerateds">
<t>
   An additional sparse data type is available called enum.  A field
   of type enum can only assume the values declared in the definition.
   Each definition is a different type.  Only enumerateds of the same
   type may be assigned or compared.  Every element of an enumerated
   must be assigned a value, as demonstrated in the following example.
   Since the elements of the enumerated are not ordered, they can be
   assigned any unique value, in any order.
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     enum { e1(v1), e2(v2), ... , en(vn), [[(n)]] } Te;
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
   Enumerateds occupy as much space in the byte stream as would its
   maximal defined ordinal value.  The following definition would
   cause one byte to be used to carry fields of type Color.
</t><t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     enum { red(3), blue(5), white(7) } Color;
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t><t>
   One may optionally specify a value without its associated tag to
   force the width definition without defining a superfluous element.
   In the following example, Taste will consume two bytes in the data
   stream but can only assume the values 1, 2 or 4.
</t><t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     enum { sweet(1), sour(2), bitter(4), (32000) } Taste;
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t><t>
   The names of the elements of an enumeration are scoped within the
   defined type.  In the first example, a fully qualified reference to
   the second element of the enumeration would be Color.blue.  Such
   qualification is not required if the target of the assignment is
   well specified.
</t><t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     Color color = Color.blue;     /* overspecified, legal */
     Color color = blue;           /* correct, type implicit */
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t><t>
   For enumerateds that are never converted to external
   representation, the numerical information may be omitted.
</t><t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     enum { low, medium, high } Amount;
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="constructed-types" title="Constructed types">
<t>
   Structure types may be constructed from primitive types for
   convenience.  Each specification declares a new, unique type.  The
   syntax for definition is much like that of C.
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
   struct {
       T1 f1;
       T2 f2;
       ...
       Tn fn;
   } [[T]];
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
   The fields within a structure may be qualified using the type's
   name using a syntax much like that available for enumerateds.  For
   example, T.f2 refers to the second field of the previous
   declaration.  Structure definitions may be embedded.
</t>

<section anchor="variants" title="Variants">
<t>
   Defined structures may have variants based on some knowledge that
   is available within the environment.  The selector must be an
   enumerated type that defines the possible variants the structure
   defines.  There must be a case arm for every element of the
   enumeration declared in the select.  The body of the variant
   structure may be given a label for reference.  The mechanism by
   which the variant is selected at runtime is not prescribed by the
   presentation language.
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     struct {
         T1 f1;
         T2 f2;
          ....
         Tn fn;
         select (E) {
             case e1: Te1;
             case e2: Te2;
                 ....
             case en: Ten;
         } [[fv]];
     } [[Tv]];

   For example

     enum { apple, orange } VariantTag;
     struct {
         uint16 number;
         opaque string<0..10>; /* variable length */
     } V1;

     struct {
         uint32 number;
         opaque string[10];    /* fixed length */
     } V2;
     struct {
         select (VariantTag) { /* value of selector is implicit */
             case apple: V1;   /* VariantBody, tag = apple */
             case orange: V2;  /* VariantBody, tag = orange */
         } variant_body;       /* optional label on variant */
     } VariantRecord;
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
   Variant structures may be qualified (narrowed) by specifying a
   value for the selector prior to the type.  For example, a
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     orange VariantRecord
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
   is a narrowed type of a VariantRecord containing a variant_body of
   type V2.

<section anchor="cryptographic-attributes" title="Cryptographic attributes">
<t>
   The four cryptographic operations digital signing, stream cipher
   encryption, block cipher encryption, and public key encryption are
   designated digitally-signed, stream-ciphered, block-ciphered, and
   public-key-encrypted, respectively.  A field's cryptographic
   processing is specified by prepending an appropriate key word
   designation before the field's type specification.  Cryptographic
   keys are implied by the current session state (see <xref target="session-states"/>).
</t>
<t>
   In digital signing, one-way hash functions are used as input for a
   signing algorithm.  In RSA signing, a 36-byte structure of two
   hashes (one SHA and one MD5) is signed (encrypted with the private
   key).  In DSS, the 20 bytes of the SHA hash are run directly
   through the Digital Signing Algorithm with no additional hashing.
</t>
<t>
   In stream cipher encryption, the plaintext is exclusive-ORed with
   an identical amount of output generated from a
   cryptographically-secure keyed pseudorandom number generator.
</t>
<t>
   In block cipher encryption, every block of plaintext encrypts to a
   block of ciphertext.  Because it is unlikely that the plaintext
   (whatever data is to be sent) will break neatly into the necessary
   block size (usually 64 bits), it is necessary to pad out the end of
   short blocks with some regular pattern, usually all zeroes.
</t>
<t>
   In public key encryption, one-way functions with secret "trapdoors"
   are used to encrypt the outgoing data.  Data encrypted with the
   public key of a given key pair can only be decrypted with the
   private key, and vice-versa.  In the following example:
</t>

<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
     stream-ciphered struct {
         uint8 field1;
         uint8 field2;
         digitally-signed opaque hash[20];
     } UserType;
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
   The contents of hash are used as input for the signing algorithm,
   then the entire structure is encrypted with a stream cipher.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="constants" title="Constants">
<t>
   Typed constants can be defined for purposes of specification by
   declaring a symbol of the desired type and assigning values to it.
   Under-specified types (opaque, variable length vectors, and
   structures that contain opaque) cannot be assigned values.  No
   fields of a multi-element structure or vector may be elided.
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
   For example,
     struct {
         uint8 f1;

<section anchor="ssl-protocol" title="SSL protocol">
<t>
   SSL is a layered protocol.  At each layer, messages may include
   fields for length, description, and content.  SSL takes messages to
   be transmitted, fragments the data into manageable blocks,
   optionally compresses the data, applies a MAC, encrypts, and
   transmits the result.  Received data is decrypted, verified,
   decompressed, and reassembled, then delivered to higher level
   clients.
</t>

<section anchor="session-states" title="Session and connection states">
<t>
   An SSL session is stateful.  It is the responsibility of the SSL
   Handshake protocol to coordinate the states of the client and
   server, thereby allowing the protocol state machines of each to
   operate consistently, despite the fact that the state is not
   exactly parallel.  Logically the state is represented twice, once
   as the current operating state, and (during the handshake protocol)
   again as the pending state.  Additionally, separate read and write
   states are maintained.  When the client or server receives a change
   cipher spec message, it copies the pending read state into the
   current read state.  When the client or server sends a change
   cipher spec message, it copies the pending write state into the
   current write state.  When the handshake negotiation is complete,
   the client and server exchange change cipher spec messages (see
   <xref target="change-cipher-spec"/>), and they then communicate using the newly agreed-upon
   cipher spec.
</t>
<t>
   An SSL session may include multiple secure connections; in
   addition, parties may have multiple simultaneous sessions.

   The session state includes the following elements:

     <t hangText="session identifier">

<section anchor="handshake-overview" title="Handshake protocol overview">
	<t>
	   The cryptographic parameters of the session state are produced by
	   the SSL Handshake Protocol, which operates on top of the SSL Record
	   Layer.  When a SSL client and server first start communicating,
	   they agree on a protocol version, select cryptographic algorithms,
	   optionally authenticate each other, and use public-key encryption
	   techniques to generate shared secrets.  These processes are
	   performed in the handshake protocol, which can be summarized as
	   follows: The client sends a client hello message to which the
	   server must respond with a server hello message, or else a fatal
	   error will occur and the connection will fail.  The client hello
	   and server hello are used to establish security enhancement
	   capabilities between client and server.  The client hello and
	   server hello establish the following attributes: Protocol Version,
	   Session ID, Cipher Suite, and Compression Method.  Additionally,
	   two random values are generated and exchanged: ClientHello.random
	   and ServerHello.random.
	</t>
	<t>
	   Following the hello messages, the server will send its certificate,
	   if it is to be authenticated.  Additionally, a server key exchange
	   message may be sent, if it is required (e.g. if their server has no
	   certificate, or if its certificate is for signing only).  If the
	   server is authenticated, it may request a certificate from the
	   client, if that is appropriate to the cipher suite selected.  Now
	   the server will send the server hello done message, indicating that
	   the hello-message phase of the handshake is complete.  The server
	   will then wait for a client response.  If the server has sent a
	   certificate request Message, the client must send either the
	   certificate message or a no_certificate alert.  The client key
	   exchange message is now sent, and the content of that message will
	   depend on the public key algorithm selected between the client
	   hello and the server hello.  If the client has sent a certificate
	   with signing ability, a digitally-signed certificate verify message
	   is sent to explicitly verify the certificate.
	</t>
	<t>
	   At this point, a change cipher spec message is sent by the client,
	   and the client copies the pending Cipher Spec into the current
	   Cipher Spec.  The client then immediately sends the finished
	   message under the new algorithms, keys, and secrets.  In response,
	   the server will send its own change cipher spec message, transfer
	   the pending to the current Cipher Spec, and send its finished
	   message under the new Cipher Spec.  At this point, the handshake is
	   complete and the client and server may begin to exchange
	   application layer data.  (See flow chart below.)

	<t>
	   When the client and server decide to resume a previous session or
	   duplicate an existing session (instead of negotiating new security
	   parameters) the message flow is as follows:
	</t>
	<t>
	   The client sends a ClientHello using the Session ID of the session
	   to be resumed.  The server then checks its session cache for a
	   match.  If a match is found, and the server is willing to
	   re-establish the connection under the specified session state, it
	   will send a ServerHello with the same Session ID value.  At this
	   point, both client and server must send change cipher spec messages
	   and proceed directly to finished messages.  Once the
	   re-establishment is complete, the client and server may begin to
	   exchange application layer data.  (See flow chart below.) If a
	   Session ID match is not found, the server generates a new session
	   ID and the SSL client and server perform a full handshake.

	   The SSL Handshake Protocol is one of the defined higher level
	   clients of the SSL Record Protocol.  This protocol is used to
	   negotiate the secure attributes of a session.  Handshake messages
	   are supplied to the SSL Record Layer, where they are encapsulated
	   within one or more SSLPlaintext structures, which are processed and
	   transmitted as specified by the current active session state.

	   The handshake protocol messages are presented in the order they

<section anchor="hello-messages-1" title="Hello messages">
	<t>
	   The hello phase messages are used to exchange security enhancement
	   capabilities between the client and server.  When a new session
	   begins, the CipherSpec encryption, hash, and compression algorithms
	   are initialized to null.  The current CipherSpec is used for
	   renegotiation messages.
	</t>

<section anchor="hello-request" title="Hello request">
	<t>
	   The hello request message may be sent by the server at any time,
	   but will be ignored by the client if the handshake protocol is
	   already underway.  It is a simple notification that the client
	   should begin the negotiation process anew by sending a client hello
	   message when convenient.
	</t>

<!--note--><t>Note: Since handshake messages are intended to have
		transmission precedence over application data, it is
		expected that the negotiation begin in no more than
		one or two times the transmission time of a maximum
		length application data message.
	</t>
	<t>
	   After sending a hello request, servers should not repeat the
	   request until the subsequent handshake negotiation is complete.  A
	   client that receives a hello request while in a handshake
	   negotiation state should simply ignore the message.

	   When a client first connects to a server it is required to send the
	   client hello as its first message.  The client can also send a
	   client hello in response to a hello request or on its own
	   initiative in order to renegotiate the security parameters in an
	   existing connection.  The client hello message includes a random
	   structure, which is used later in the protocol.

	   The client hello message includes a variable length session

	   the same client and server whose security parameters the client
	   wishes to reuse.  The session identifier may be from an earlier
	   connection, this connection, or another currently active
	   connection.  The second option is useful if the client only wishes
	   to update the random structures and derived values of a connection,
	   while the third option makes it possible to establish several
	   simultaneous independent secure connections without repeating the
	   full handshake protocol.  The actual contents of the SessionID are
	   defined by the server.

	   The CipherSuite list, passed from the client to the server in the

	   Diffie-Hellman.  DH denotes cipher suites in which the server's
	   certificate contains the Diffie-Hellman parameters signed by the
	   certificate authority (CA).  DHE denotes ephemeral Diffie-Hellman,
	   where the Diffie-Hellman parameters are signed by a DSS or RSA
	   certificate, which has been signed by the CA.  The signing
	   algorithm used is specified after the DH or DHE parameter.  In all
	   cases, the client must have the same type of certificate, and must
	   use the Diffie-Hellman parameters chosen by the server.

		<t hangText="application protocol">
			An application protocol is a protocol that
                          normally layers directly on top of the
                          transport layer (e.g., TCP/IP).  Examples
                          include HTTP, TELNET, FTP, and SMTP.</t>
		<t hangText="asymetric cipher">See public key cryptography.</t>
		<t hangText="authentication">Authentication is the ability of one entity
				  to determine the identity of another entity.</t>
		<t hangText="block cipher">A block cipher is an algorithm that operates
				  on plaintext in groups of bits, called
				  blocks.  64 bits is a typical block size.</t>
		<t hangText="bulk cipher">A symmetric encryption algorithm used to
				  encrypt large quantities of data.</t>
		<t hangText="cipher block chaining">
				  Mode (CBC) CBC is a mode in which every
				  plaintext block encrypted with the block
				  cipher is first exclusive-ORed with the
				  previous ciphertext block (or, in the case
				  of the first block, with the initialization
				  vector).</t>
		<t hangText="certificate">As part of the X.509 protocol (a.k.a. ISO
				  Authentication framework), certificates are
				  assigned by a trusted Certificate Authority
				  and provide verification of a party's
				  identity and may also supply its public key.</t>
		<t hangText="client">The application entity that initiates a
				  connection to a server.</t>
		<t hangText="client write key">The key used to encrypt data written by the
				  client.</t>
		<t hangText="client write MAC secret">
				  The secret data used to authenticate data
				  written by the client.</t>
		<t hangText="connection">A connection is a transport (in the OSI
				  layering model definition) that provides a
				  suitable type of service.  For SSL, such
				  connections are peer to peer relationships.
				  The connections are transient.  Every
				  connection is associated with one session.</t>
		<t hangText="Data Encryption Standard">
				  (DES) DES is a very widely used symmetric
				  encryption algorithm.  DES is a block
				  cipher.</t>
		<t hangText="Digital Signature Standard">
				  (DSS) A standard for digital signing,
				  including the Digital Signing Algorithm,
				  approved by the National Institute of
				  Standards and Technology, defined in NIST
				  FIPS PUB 186, "Digital Signature Standard,"
				  published May, 1994 by the U.S. Dept.  of
				  Commerce.</t>
		<t hangText="digital signatures">Digital signatures utilize public key
				  cryptography and one-way hash functions to
				  produce a signature of the data that can be
				  authenticated, and is difficult to forge or
				  repudiate.</t>
		<t hangText="FORTEZZA">A PCMCIA card that provides both encryption
				  and digital signing.</t>
		<t hangText="handshake">An initial negotiation between client and
				  server that establishes the parameters of
				  their transactions.</t>
		<t hangText="Initialization Vector">
				  (IV) When a block cipher is used in CBC
				  mode, the initialization vector is
				  exclusive-ORed with the first plaintext
				  block prior to encryption.</t>
		<t hangText="IDEA">A 64-bit block cipher designed by Xuejia Lai
				  and James Massey.</t>
		<t hangText="Message Authentication Code">
				  (MAC) A Message Authentication Code is a
				  one-way hash computed from a message and
				  some secret data.  Its purpose is to detect
				  if the message has been altered.</t>
		<t hangText="master secret">Secure secret data used for generating
				  encryption keys, MAC secrets, and IVs.</t>
		<t hangText="MD5">MD5 <xref target="RFC1321"/> is a secure hashing function that
				  converts an arbitrarily long data stream
				  into a digest of fixed size.</t>
		<t hangText="public key cryptography">
				  A class of cryptographic techniques
				  employing two-key ciphers.  Messages
				  encrypted with the public key can only be
				  decrypted with the associated private key.
				  Conversely, messages signed with the private
				  key can be verified with the public key.</t>
		<t hangText="one-way hash function">
				  A one-way transformation that converts an
				  arbitrary amount of data into a fixed-length
				  hash.  It is computation- ally hard to
				  reverse the transformation or to find
				  collisions.  MD5 and SHA are examples of
				  one-way hash functions.</t>
		<t hangText="RC2, RC4">Proprietary bulk ciphers from RSA Data
				  Security, Inc.  (There is no good reference
				  to these as they are unpublished works;
				  however, see <xref target="RSADSI"/>).  RC2 is block cipher
				  and RC4 is a stream cipher.</t>
		<t hangText="RSA">A very widely used public-key algorithm that
				  can be used for either encryption or digital
				  signing.</t>
		<t hangText="salt">Non-secret random data used to make export
				  encryption keys resist precomputation
				  attacks.</t>
		<t hangText="server">The server is the application entity that
				  responds to requests for connections from
				  clients.  The server is passive, waiting for
				  requests from clients.</t>
		<t hangText="session">A SSL session is an association between a
				  client and a server.  Sessions are created
				  by the handshake protocol.  Sessions define
				  a set of cryptographic security parameters,
				  which can be shared among multiple
				  connections.  Sessions are used to avoid the
				  expensive negotiation of new security
				  parameters for each connection.</t>
		<t hangText="session identifier">A session identifier is a value generated by
				  a server that identifies a particular
				  session.</t>
		<t hangText="server write key">The key used to encrypt data written by the
				  server.</t>
		<t hangText="server write MAC secret">
				  The secret data used to authenticate data
				  written by the server.</t>
		<t hangText="SHA">   The Secure Hash Algorithm is defined in FIPS
				  PUB 180-1.  It produces a 20-byte output
				  <xref target="SHA"/>.</t>
		<t hangText="stream cipher">An encryption algorithm that converts a key
				  into a cryptographically-strong keystream,
				  which is then exclusive-ORed with the
				  plaintext.</t>
		<t hangText="symmetric cipher">     See bulk cipher.</t>

	<t>
	   The SSL protocol cannot prevent many common security mistakes.
	   This section provides several recommendations to assist
	   implementers.
	</t>

<section anchor="temp-rsa-keys" title="Temporary RSA keys">
	<t>
	   US Export restrictions limit RSA keys used for encryption to 512
	   bits, but do not place any limit on lengths of RSA keys used for
	   signing operations.  Certificates often need to be larger than 512
	   bits, since 512-bit RSA keys are not secure enough for high-value
	   transactions or for applications requiring long-term security.
	   Some certificates are also designated signing-only, in which case
	   they cannot be used for key exchange.
	</t>
	<t>
		When the public key in the certificate cannot be used for
		encryption, the server signs a temporary RSA key, which is then
		exchanged.  In exportable applications, the temporary RSA key
		should be the maximum allowable length (i.e., 512 bits).  Because
		512-bit RSA keys are relatively insecure, they should be changed
		often.  For typical electronic commerce applications, it is
		suggested that keys be changed daily or every 500 transactions, and
		more often if possible.  Note that while it is acceptable to use
		the same temporary key for multiple transactions, it must be signed
		each time it is used.
	</t>
	<t>
	   RSA key generation is a time-consuming process.  In many cases, a
	   low-priority process can be assigned the task of key generation.
	   Whenever a new key is completed, the existing temporary key can be
	   replaced with the new one.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="random-number-generation" title="Random Number Generation and Seeding">
	<t>
	   SSL requires a cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number
	   generator (PRNG).  Care must be taken in designing and seeding
	   PRNGs.  PRNGs based on secure hash operations, most notably MD5
	   and/or SHA, are acceptable, but cannot provide more security than
	   the size of the random number generator state.  (For example,
	   MD5-based PRNGs usually provide 128 bits of state.)
	</t>
	<t>
	   To estimate the amount of seed material being produced, add the
	   number of bits of unpredictable information in each seed byte.  For
	   example, keystroke timing values taken from a PC- compatible's 18.2
	   Hz timer provide 1 or 2 secure bits each, even though the total
	   size of the counter value is 16 bits or more.  To seed a 128-bit
	   PRNG, one would thus require approximately 100 such timer values.
	</t>

<!--note--><t>Note:
		The seeding functions in RSAREF and versions of
                  BSAFE prior to 3.0 are order-independent.  For
                  example, if 1000 seed bits are supplied, one at a
                  time, in 1000 separate calls to the seed function,
                  the PRNG will end up in a state which depends only
                  on the number of 0 or 1 seed bits in the seed data
                  (i.e., there are 1001 possible final states).
                  Applications using BSAFE or RSAREF must take extra
                  care to ensure proper seeding.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="certificate-and-auth" title="Certificates and authentication">
	<t>
	   Implementations are responsible for verifying the integrity of
	   certificates and should generally support certificate revocation
	   messages.  Certificates should always be verified to ensure proper
	   signing by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  The selection and
	   addition of trusted CAs should be done very carefully.  Users
	   should be able to view information about the certificate and root
	   CA.

<section anchor="notes-ciphersuites" title="CipherSuites">
	<t>
	   SSL supports a range of key sizes and security levels, including
	   some which provide no or minimal security.  A proper implementation
	   will probably not support many cipher suites.  For example, 40-bit
	   encryption is easily broken, so implementations requiring strong
	   security should not allow 40-bit keys.  Similarly, anonymous
	   Diffie-Hellman is strongly discouraged because it cannot prevent
	   man-in-the- middle attacks.  Applications should also enforce
	   minimum and maximum key sizes.  For example, certificate chains
	   containing 512-bit RSA keys or signatures are not appropriate for
	   high-security applications.

<section anchor="notes-fortezza" title="FORTEZZA">
	<t>
	   This section describes implementation details for ciphersuites that
	   make use of the FORTEZZA hardware encryption system.
	</t>

<section anchor="notes-non-fortezza-hardware" title="Notes on use of FORTEZZA hardware">
	<t>
		A complete explanation of all issues regarding the use of FORTEZZA
		hardware is outside the scope of this document.  However, there are
		a few special requirements of SSL that deserve mention.
	</t>
	<t>
		Because SSL is a full duplex protocol, two crypto states must be
		maintained, one for reading and one for writing.  There are also a
		number of circumstances which can result in the crypto state in the
		FORTEZZA card being lost.  For these reasons, it's recommended that
		the current crypto state be saved after processing a record, and
		loaded before processing the next.
	</t>
	<t>
	   After the client generates the TEK, it also generates two MEKs,
	   for one for reading and one for writing.  After generating each of
	   these keys, the client must generate a corresponding IV and then
	   save the crypto state.  The client also uses the TEK to generate an
	   IV and encrypt the premaster secret.  All three IVs are sent to the
	   server, along with the wrapped keys and the encrypted premaster
	   secret in the client key exchange message.  At this point, the TEK
	   is no longer needed, and may be discarded.
	</t>
	<t>
	   On the server side, the server uses the master IV and the TEK to
	   decrypt the premaster secret.  It also loads the wrapped MEKs into
	   the card.  The server loads both IVs to verify that the IVs match
	   the keys.  However, since the card is unable to encrypt after
	   loading an IV, the server must generate a new IV for the server
	   write key.  This IV is discarded.
	</t>
	<t>
	   When encrypting the first encrypted record (and only that record),
	   the server adds 8 bytes of random data to the beginning of the
	   fragment.  These 8 bytes are discarded by the client after
	   decryption.  The purpose of this is to synchronize the state on the
	   client and server resulting from the different IVs.
	</t>

	   5) FORTEZZA_NULL_WITH_NULL_SHA:
	     Uses the full FORTEZZA key exchange, including sending server and
	     client write keys and iv's.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="notes-fortezza-resumption" title="FORTEZZA Session resumption">
	<t>
	   There are two possibilities for FORTEZZA session restart:
	   1) Never restart a FORTEZZA session.
	   2) Restart a session with the previously negotiated keys and iv's.
	</t>
	<t>
		Never restarting a FORTEZZA session:
	</t>
	<t>
	   Clients who never restart FORTEZZA sessions should never send
	   Session ID's which were previously used in a FORTEZZA session as
	   part of the ClientHello.  Servers who never restart FORTEZZA
	   sessions should never send a previous session id on the
	   ServerHello if the negotiated session is FORTEZZA.
	</t>
	<t>Restart a session:</t>
	<t>
	   You cannot restart FORTEZZA on a session which has never done a
	   complete FORTEZZA key exchange (That is you cannot restart FORTEZZA
	   if the session was an RSA/RC4 session renegotiated for FORTEZZA).
	   If you wish to restart a FORTEZZA session, you must save the MEKs
	   and IVs from the initial key exchange for this session and reuse
	   them for any new connections on that session.  This is not
	   recommended, but it is possible.

	   After decrypting the ENCRYPTED- KEY-DATA field, servers that

<section anchor="security-analysis" title="Security analysis">
	<t>
	   The SSL protocol is designed to establish a secure connection
	   between a client and a server communicating over an insecure
	   channel.  This document makes several traditional assumptions,
	   including that attackers have substantial computational resources
	   and cannot obtain secret information from sources outside the
	   protocol.  Attackers are assumed to have the ability to capture,
	   modify, delete, replay, and otherwise tamper with messages sent
	   over the communication channel.  This appendix outlines how SSL has
	   been designed to resist a variety of attacks.
	</t>
<section anchor="security-handshake" title="Handshake protocol">
	<t>
	   The handshake protocol is responsible for selecting a CipherSpec
	   and generating a MasterSecret, which together comprise the primary
	   cryptographic parameters associated with a secure session.  The
	   handshake protocol can also optionally authenticate parties who
	   have certificates signed by a trusted certificate authority.
	</t>

<section anchor="security-authentication" title="Authentication and key exchange">
	<t>
	   SSL supports three authentication modes: authentication of both
	   parties, server authentication with an unauthenticated client, and
	   total anonymity.  Whenever the server is authenticated, the channel
	   should be secure against man-in- the-middle attacks, but completely
	   anonymous sessions are inherently vulnerable to such attacks.
	   Anonymous servers cannot authenticate clients, since the client
	   signature in the certificate verify message may require a server
	   certificate to bind the signature to a particular server.  If the
	   server is authenticated, its certificate message must provide a
	   valid certificate chain leading to an acceptable certificate
	   authority.  Similarly, authenticated clients must supply an
	   acceptable certificate to the server.  Each party is responsible
	   for verifying that the other's certificate is valid and has not
	   expired or been revoked.
	</t>
	<t>
	   The general goal of the key exchange process is to create a
	   pre_master_secret known to the communicating parties and not to
	   attackers.  The pre_master_secret will be used to generate the
	   master_secret (see <xref target="asymmetric-crypto-computations"/>).  The master_secret is required to
	   generate the finished messages, encryption keys, and MAC secrets
	   (see <xref target="finished"/> and <xref target="converting-master-secret"/>).  By sending a correct finished
	   message, parties thus prove that they know the correct
	   pre_master_secret.
	</t>

<section anchor="security-anonymous-auth" title="Anonymous key exchange">
	<t>
	   Completely anonymous sessions can be established using RSA,
	   Diffie-Hellman, or FORTEZZA for key exchange.  With anonymous RSA,
	   the client encrypts a pre_master_secret with the server's
	   uncertified public key extracted from the server key exchange
	   message.  The result is sent in a client key exchange message.
	   Since eavesdroppers do not know the server's private key, it will
	   be infeasible for them to decode the pre_master_secret.
	</t>
	<t>
	   With Diffie-Hellman or FORTEZZA, the server's public parameters are
	   contained in the server key exchange message and the client's are
	   sent in the client key exchange message.  Eavesdroppers who do not
	   know the private values should not be able to find the
	   Diffie-Hellman result (i.e.  the pre_master_secret) or the FORTEZZA
	   token encryption key (TEK).
	</t>
<!--note--><t>Warning:
		Completely anonymous connections only provide
                  protection against passive eavesdropping.  Unless an
                  independent tamper-proof channel is used to verify
                  that the finished messages were not replaced by an
                  attacker, server authentication is required in
                  environments where active man-in-the-middle attacks
                  are a concern.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-rsa-auth" title="RSA key exchange and authentication">
	<t>
	   With RSA, key exchange and server authentication are combined.  The
	   public key may be either contained in the server's certificate or
	   may be a temporary RSA key sent in a server key exchange message.
	   When temporary RSA keys are used, they are signed by the server's
	   RSA or DSS certificate.  The signature includes the current
	   ClientHello.random, so old signatures and temporary keys cannot be
	   replayed.  Servers may use a single temporary RSA key for multiple
	   negotiation sessions.
	</t>
<!--note--><t>Note:
		The temporary RSA key option is useful if servers
                  need large certificates but must comply with
                  government-imposed size limits on keys used for key
                  exchange.
	</t>
	<t>
	   After verifying the server's certificate, the client encrypts a
	   pre_master_secret with the server's public key.  By successfully
	   decoding the pre_master_secret and producing a correct finished
	   message, the server demonstrates that it knows the private key
	   corresponding to the server certificate.
	</t>
	<t>
	   When RSA is used for key exchange, clients are authenticated using
	   the certificate verify message (see <xref target="certificate-verify"/>).  The client
	   signs a value derived from the master_secret and all preceding
	   handshake messages.  These handshake messages include the server
	   certificate, which binds the signature to the server, and
	   ServerHello.random, which binds the signature to the current
	   handshake process.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-diffie-hellman-auth" title="Diffie-Hellman key exchange with authentication">
	<t>
	   When Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used, the server can either
	   supply a certificate containing fixed Diffie-Hellman parameters or
	   can use the server key exchange message to send a set of temporary
	   Diffie-Hellman parameters signed with a DSS or RSA certificate.
	   Temporary parameters are hashed with the hello.random values before
	   signing to ensure that attackers do not replay old parameters.  In
	   either case, the client can verify the certificate or signature to
	   ensure that the parameters belong to the server.
	</t><t>
	   If the client has a certificate containing fixed Diffie- Hellman
	   parameters, its certificate contains the information required to
	   complete the key exchange.  Note that in this case the client and
	   server will generate the same Diffie- Hellman result (i.e.,
	   pre_master_secret) every time they communicate.  To prevent the
	   pre_master_secret from staying in memory any longer than necessary,
	   it should be converted into the master_secret as soon as possible.
	   Client Diffie- Hellman parameters must be compatible with those
	   supplied by the server for the key exchange to work.
	</t><t>
	   If the client has a standard DSS or RSA certificate or is
	   unauthenticated, it sends a set of temporary parameters to the
	   server in the client key exchange message, then optionally uses a
	   certificate verify message to authenticate itself.

<section anchor="security-fortezza" title="FORTEZZA">
	<t>
	   FORTEZZA's design is classified, but at the protocol level it is
	   similar to Diffie-Hellman with fixed public values contained in
	   certificates.  The result of the key exchange process is the token
	   encryption key (TEK), which is used to wrap data encryption keys,
	   client write key, server write key, and master secret encryption
	   key.  The data encryption keys are not derived from the
	   pre_master_secret because unwrapped keys are not accessible outside
	   the token.  The encrypted pre_master_secret is sent to the server
	   in a client key exchange message.
	</t>

<section anchor="security-version-rollback" title="Version rollback attacks">
	<t>
	   Because SSL Version 3.0 includes substantial improvements over SSL
	   Version 2.0, attackers may try to make Version 3.0- capable clients
	   and servers fall back to Version 2.0.  This attack is occurring if
	   (and only if) two Version 3.0-capable parties use an SSL 2.0
	   handshake.
	</t>
	<t>
	   Although the solution using non-random PKCS #1 block type 2 message
	   padding is inelegant, it provides a reasonably secure way for
	   Version 3.0 servers to detect the attack.  This solution is not
	   secure against attackers who can brute force the key and substitute
	   a new ENCRYPTED-KEY-DATA message containing the same key (but with
	   normal padding) before the application specified wait threshold has
	   expired.  Parties concerned about attacks of this scale should not
	   be using 40-bit encryption keys anyway.  Altering the padding of
	   the least-significant 8 bytes of the PKCS padding does not impact
	   security, since this is essentially equivalent to increasing the
	   input block size by 8 bytes.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-detecting-attacks" title="Detecting attacks against the handshake protocol">
	<t>
	   An attacker might try to influence the handshake exchange to make
	   the parties select different encryption algorithms than they would
	   normally choose.  Because many implementations will support 40-bit
	   exportable encryption and some may even support null encryption or
	   MAC algorithms, this attack is of particular concern.
	</t>
	<t>
	   For this attack, an attacker must actively change one or more
	   handshake messages.  If this occurs, the client and server will
	   compute different values for the handshake message hashes.  As a
	   result, the parties will not accept each others' finished messages.
	   Without the master_secret, the attacker cannot repair the finished
	   messages, so the attack will be discovered.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-resuming-sessions" title="Resuming sessions">
	<t>
	   When a connection is established by resuming a session, new
	   ClientHello.random and ServerHello.random values are hashed with
	   the session's master_secret.  Provided that the master_secret has
	   not been compromised and that the secure hash operations used to
	   produce the encryption keys and MAC secrets are secure, the
	   connection should be secure and effectively independent from
	   previous connections.  Attackers cannot use known encryption keys
	   or MAC secrets to compromise the master_secret without breaking the
	   secure hash operations (which use both SHA and MD5).
	</t><t>
	   Sessions cannot be resumed unless both the client and server agree.
	   If either party suspects that the session may have been
	   compromised, or that certificates may have expired or been revoked,
	   it should force a full handshake.  An upper limit of 24 hours is
	   suggested for session ID lifetimes, since an attacker who obtains a
	   master_secret may be able to impersonate the compromised party
	   until the corresponding session ID is retired.  Applications that
	   may be run in relatively insecure environments should not write
	   session IDs to stable storage.
	</t>
</section>
<section anchor="security-md5-and-sha" title="MD5 and SHA">
	<t>
	   SSL uses hash functions very conservatively.  Where possible, both
	   MD5 and SHA are used in tandem to ensure that non- catastrophic
	   flaws in one algorithm will not break the overall protocol.
	</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="protecting-app-data" title="Protecting application data">
	<t>
	   The master_secret is hashed with the ClientHello.random and
	   ServerHello.random to produce unique data encryption keys and MAC
	   secrets for each connection.  FORTEZZA encryption keys are
	   generated by the token, and are not derived from the master_secret.
	</t>
	<t>
	   Outgoing data is protected with a MAC before transmission.  To
	   prevent message replay or modification attacks, the MAC is computed
	   from the MAC secret, the sequence number, the message length, the
	   message contents, and two fixed character strings.  The message
	   type field is necessary to ensure that messages intended for one
	   SSL Record Layer client are not redirected to another.  The
	   sequence number ensures that attempts to delete or reorder messages
	   will be detected.  Since sequence numbers are 64-bits long, they
	   should never overflow.  Messages from one party cannot be inserted
	   into the other's output, since they use independent MAC secrets.
	   Similarly, the server-write and client-write keys are independent
	   so stream cipher keys are used only once.
	</t><t>
	   If an attacker does break an encryption key, all messages encrypted
	   with it can be read.  Similarly, compromise of a MAC key can make
	   message modification attacks possible.  Because MACs are also
	   encrypted, message-alteration attacks generally require breaking
	   the encryption algorithm as well as the MAC.
	</t>
<!--note--><t>Note:
		MAC secrets may be larger than encryption keys, so
                  messages can remain tamper resistant even if
                  encryption keys are broken.
        </t>

<section anchor="final-notes" title="Final notes">
	<t>
		For SSL to be able to provide a secure connection, both the client
		and server systems, keys, and applications must be secure.  In
		addition, the implementation must be free of security errors.
	</t>
	<t>
	   The system is only as strong as the weakest key exchange and
	   authentication algorithm supported, and only trustworthy
	   cryptographic functions should be used.  Short public keys, 40-bit
	   bulk encryption keys, and anonymous servers should be used with
	   great caution.  Implementations and users must be careful when
	   deciding which certificates and certificate authorities are
	   acceptable; a dishonest certificate authority can do tremendous
	   damage.

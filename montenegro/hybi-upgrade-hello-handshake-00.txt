Internet-Draft      WebSocket Upgrade+Hello Handshake      December 2010


1.  Introduction

   As of version 3 of the websocket (WS) protocol
   [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol], the handshake used to
   transition from HTTP to Websocket protocol is deficient with respect
   to HTTP compatibility and security.  Accordingly, much discussion has
   ensued to try to define the replacement handshake for adoption by the
   WG.

   The handshake defined in this document maintains compatibility with
   HTTP in accordance with [I-D.ietf-hybi-websocket-requirements] while
   protecting against currently known vulnerabilities.  It leverages the
   'GET+Upgrade' approach in the current handshake, in addition to
   several other mechanisms, as detailed below.

   An initial version of this handshake has been previously shared with
   the working group
   (http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg04534.html).

2.  Terminology

   This document uses HyBi-related terms as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-hybi-websocket-requirements].

3.  Upgrade+Hello Handshake

   The Upgrade+Hello handshake implements the following mechanisms:

   a.  Use Websocket Hello from the server and a Websocket Hello from
       the client, using Websocket frames to transport hashed nonces
       (rather than unframed bytes).  This fixes the issue with
       intermediaries not forwarding the unframed bytes on the wire and
       makes the handshake comply with the requirement to be HTTP/1.1
       compliant up through the 101 response from the server.

   b.  Include a server nonce in the server-sent Hello, that the client
       must hash and return in its Hello.

   c.  Use a Hello frame type instead of ping/pong.  This does not
       require an extra round trip.  It just ensures that the first
       frame in each direction is something that is entirely not HTTP
       and uses the Websocket binary framing instead.

   d.  Replace the char/space encoding of the client nonce with simple
       hex encoding.

   e.  Define tight restrictions on the punctuation that can be sent in
       ws URLs and subprotocols (e.g., prohibit use of ':' ) so that

       they cannot be used to inject HTTP headers.  While not as robust
       as encrypting the handshakes, these restrictions will provide
       substantial protection against user provided data being used as
       part of an attack.

   f.  Invert the framing MORE bit to be a FIN bit, so that WS control
       frames will start with a non-ascii character.  This mitigates the
       attack vector affecting some intermediaries (transparent proxies,
       load balancers, etc) that have been known to continue parsing the
       traffic (incorrectly assuming it is still HTTP) even after the
       handshake.

   g.  TODO: Change use of MD5 to SHA1.  Note the use in a "Challenge-
       Response" manner is not considered susceptible to recent attacks
       against these hash families per RFC4270, but still makes sense to
       migrate away from MD5 if nothing else for easier deployment.

   The above summarizes the changes.  The following sections show the
   text changes that implement the above mechanisms, in traditional
   "OLD" and "NEW" IETF notation.

4.  Changes to 1.2.  Protocol overview

   OLD:

           GET /demo HTTP/1.1
           Host: example.com
           Connection: Upgrade

           Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: sample
           Upgrade: WebSocket
           Sec-WebSocket-Key1: 4 @1  46546xW%0l 1 5
           Origin: http://example.com

           ^n:ds[4U

      The handshake from the server looks as follows:


           HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake
           Upgrade: WebSocket
           Connection: Upgrade
           Sec-WebSocket-Origin: http://example.com
           Sec-WebSocket-Location: ws://example.com/demo

           Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: sample
           Upgrade: WebSocket
           Origin: http://example.com
           Sec-WebSocket-Draft: 3


      The handshake from the server looks as follows:


           HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
           Upgrade: WebSocket
           Connection: Upgrade
           Sec-WebSocket-Origin: http://example.com
           Sec-WebSocket-Location: ws://example.com/demo
           Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: sample

   OLD:

   Finally, after the last field, the client sends 10 bytes starting
   with 0x0D 0x0A and followed by 8 random bytes, part of a challenge,
   and the server sends 18 bytes starting with 0x0D 0x0A and followed by
   16 bytes consisting of a challenge response.  The details of this
   challenge and other parts of the handshake are described in the next
   section.

   Once the client and server have both sent their handshakes, and if
   the handshake was successful, then the data transfer part starts.
   This is a two-way communication channel where each side can,
   independently from the other, send data at will.

5.  Changes to 1.3.  Opening handshake

   OLD:

   The opening handshake is intended to be compatible with HTTP-based
   server-side software, so that a single port can be used by both HTTP
   clients talking to that server and WebSocket clients talking to that
   server.  To this end, the WebSocket client's handshake appears to
   HTTP servers to be a regular GET request with an Upgrade offer:


        GET / HTTP/1.1
        Upgrade: WebSocket
        Connection: Upgrade

   Fields in the handshake are sent by the client in a random order; the
   order is not meaningful.

   Any valid URI may be passed, except that the client must not send a
   handshake with a URI path that contain the character ':' or any
   control or whitspace characters in explicit or encoded form.  This
   limits the possibility of using a websocket client to attack a
   vulnerable non WebSocket servers.

   Fields in the handshake are sent by the client in an unspecified
   order; the order is not meaningful.

Internet-Draft      WebSocket Upgrade+Hello Handshake      December 2010


   To prove that the handshake was received, the server has to take
   three pieces of information and combine them to form a response.  The
   first two pieces of information come from the |Sec-WebSocket-Key1|
   and |Sec-WebSocket-Key2| fields in the client handshake:


        Sec-WebSocket-Key1: 18x 6]8vM;54 *(5:  {   U1]8  z [  8
        Sec-WebSocket-Key2: 1_ tx7X d  <  nw  334J702) 7]o}` 0

   For each of these fields, the server has to take the digits from the
   value to obtain a number (in this case 1868545188 and 1733470270
   respectively), then divide that number by the number of spaces
   characters in the value (in this case 12 and 10) to obtain a 32-bit
   number (155712099 and 173347027).  These two resulting numbers are
   then used in the server handshake, as described below.

   The counting of spaces is intended to make it impossible to smuggle
   this field into the resource name; making this even harder is the
   presence of _two_ such fields, and the use of a newline as the only
   reliable indicator that the end of the key has been reached.  The use
   of random characters interspersed with the spaces and the numbers
   ensures that the implementor actually looks for spaces and newlines,
   instead of being treating any character like a space, which would
   make it again easy to smuggle the fields into the path and trick the
   server.  Finally, _dividing_ by this number of spaces is intended to
   make sure that even the most naive of implementations will check for
   spaces, since if ther server does not verify that there are some
   spaces, the server will try to divide by zero, which is usually fatal
   (a correct handshake will always have at least one space).

   The third piece of information is given after the fields, in the last
   eight bytes of the handshake, expressed here as they would be seen if
   interpreted as UTF-8:

        Tm[K T2u

   The concatenation of the number obtained from processing the |Sec-
   WebSocket-Key1| field, expressed as a big-endian 32 bit number, the
   number obtained from processing the |Sec-WebSocket-Key2| field, again
   expressed as a big-endian 32 bit number, and finally the eight bytes
   at the end of the handshake, form a 128 bit string whose MD5 sum is
   then used by the server to prove that it read the handshake.

   NEW:

   To prove that the handshake was received, the server has to initiate
   websocket communication with a Hello frame containing the MD5 hash of
   a random 64 bit client nonce generated by the client and sent as a

   hex encoded string in the Sec-WebSocket-Nonce field of the client
   handshake:


           Sec-WebSocket-Nonce: A23F2BCA452DDE01


   The server has to take 8 octets of the client nonce, append the
   octets of the ASCII string "WebSocket" and then append 8 octets of a
   randomly generated server nonce (eg 15F0D2278BCD457F).  The server
   nonce and the 16 octet MD5 hash (eg Ee7eBe0c369cBf255a4451Fc58D7Cc4f)
   of the combined octets must be sent in a Hello frame as the first
   websocket frame from the server to the client:


         8F18 15F0D2278BCD457F Ee7eBe0c369cBf255a4451Fc58D7Cc4f

   OLD:

   After the fields, the server sends the aforementioned MD5 sum, a 16
   byte (128 bit) value, shown here as if interpreted as UTF-8:

        fQJ,fN/4F4!~K~MH

   This value depends on what the client sends, as described above.  If
   it doesn't match what the client is expecting, the client would
   disconnect.

   Having part of the handshake appear after the fields ensures that
   both the server and the client verify that the connection is not
   being interrupted by an HTTP intermediary such as a man-in-the-middle
   cache or proxy.

   NEW:

   After the fields, the server sends the aforementioned Hello frame
   containing the 8 octets of the server nonce followed by the 16 octets
   of the MD5 digest.

   After receiving the server handshake, the client must wait for the
   following Hello frame and verify that the contents.  The digest value
   depends on both the client and server nonces, as described above.  If
   it doesn't match what the client is expecting, the client must
   disconnect.  Only after verifying the contents of the Hello frame may
   the client application be notified of an open connection.

   The first websocket frame sent by the client to the server must be a
   Hello frame containing the 128 bit MD5 digest of the 8 octets of the

6.  Changes to 1.9  Subprotocols using the WebSocket protocol

   OLD:

   The client can request that the server use a specific subprotocol by
   including the |Sec-Websocket-Protocol| field in its handshake.  If it
   is specified, the server needs to include the same field and one of
   the selected subprotocol values in its response for the connection to
   be established.

   These subprotocol names do not need to be registered, but if a

9.  Changes to 4.3.  Fragmentation

   OLD:

   o  An unfragmented message consists of a single frame with the MORE
      bit clear and an opcode other than 0.

   o  A fragmented message consists of a single frame with the MORE bit
      set and an opcode other than 0, followed by zero or more frames
      with the MORE bit set and the opcode set to 0, and terminated by a
      single frame with the MORE bit clear and an opcode of 0.  Its
      content is the concatenation of the application data from each of
      those frames in order.

   Add a NEW section 4.4.4. after 4.4.3 for the new "Hello" command:

   4.4.4.  Hello

      The Hello message contains an opcode of 0x0F and must be the first
      frame sent on any WebSocket connection.

      A Hello message sent from the server to the client must contain 24
      octets of data, comprising of the 8 octets of the server nonce and
      the 16 octets of the MD5 digest of the 41 octets of the client
      nonce, plus the ASCII string "WebSocket", plus the server nonce.

        NOTE: This corresponds to random printable ASCII characters
        other than the digits and the U+0020 SPACE character.

        EXAMPLE: Continuing the example, this could lead to "P388O503D&
        ul7{K%gX(%715" and "1N?|kUT0or3o4I97N5-S3O31".

   25.  Insert /spaces_1/ U+0020 SPACE characters into /key_1/ at random

Internet-Draft      WebSocket Upgrade+Hello Handshake      December 2010


           /key_2/
              The value of the "Sec-WebSocket-Key2" field in the client's
              handshake.

           /key_3/
              The eight random bytes sent after the first 0x0D 0x0A 0x0D
              0x0A sequence in the client's handshake.

      3.   Let /location/ be the string that results from constructing a
           WebSocket URL from /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure
           flag/.

      4.   Let /key-number_1/ be the digits (characters in the range U+0030
           DIGIT ZERO (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9)) in /key_1/, interpreted
           as a base ten integer, ignoring all other characters in /key_1/.

           Let /key-number_2/ be the digits (characters in the range U+0030
           DIGIT ZERO (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9)) in /key_2/, interpreted
           as a base ten integer, ignoring all other characters in /key_2/.

              EXAMPLE: For example, assume that the client handshake was:


                 GET / HTTP/1.1
                 Connection: Upgrade
                 Host: example.com
                 Upgrade: WebSocket
                 Sec-WebSocket-Key1: 3e6b263  4 17 80
                 Origin: http://example.com
                 Sec-WebSocket-Key2: 17  9 G`ZD9   2 2b 7X 3 /r90

                 WjN}|M(6

              The /key-number_1/ would be the number 3,626,341,780, and the
              /key-number_2/ would be the number 1,799,227,390.

              In this example, incidentally, /key_3/ is "WjN}|M(6", or 0x57
              0x6A 0x4E 0x7D 0x7C 0x4D 0x28 0x36.

      5.   Let /spaces_1/ be the number of U+0020 SPACE characters in
           /key_1/.

           Let /spaces_2/ be the number of U+0020 SPACE characters in
           /key_2/.

           If either /spaces_1/ or /spaces_2/ is zero, then abort the
           WebSocket connection.  This is a symptom of a cross-protocol
           attack.

           EXAMPLE: In the example above, /spaces_1/ would be 4 and
           /spaces_2/ would be 10.

      6.   If /key-number_1/ is not an integral multiple of /spaces_1/,
           then abort the WebSocket connection.

           If /key-number_2/ is not an integral multiple of /spaces_2/,
           then abort the WebSocket connection.

           NOTE: This can only happen if the client is not a conforming
           WebSocket client.

      7.   Let /part_1/ be /key-number_1/ divided by /spaces_1/.

           Let /part_2/ be /key-number_2/ divided by /spaces_2/.

           EXAMPLE: In the example above, /part_1/ would be 906,585,445 and
           /part_2/ would be 179,922,739.

      8.   Let /challenge/ be the concatenation of /part_1/, expressed as a
           big-endian 32 bit integer, /part_2/, expressed as a big-endian
           32 bit integer, and the eight bytes of /key_3/ in the order they
           were sent on the wire.

           EXAMPLE: In the example above, this would be the 16 bytes 0x36
           0x09 0x65 0x65 0x0A 0xB9 0x67 0x33 0x57 0x6A 0x4E 0x7D 0x7C 0x4D
           0x28 0x36.

      9.   Let /response/ be the MD5 fingerprint of /challenge/ as a big-
           endian 128 bit string.  [RFC1321]

           EXAMPLE: In the example above, this would be the 16 bytes 0x6E
           0x60 0x39 0x65 0x42 0x6B 0x39 0x7A 0x24 0x52 0x38 0x70 0x4F 0x74
           0x56 0x62, or "n`9eBk9z$R8pOtVb" in UTF-8.

        /client nonce/
           The value of the "Sec-WebSocket-Nonce" field in the client's
           handshake.

        /server nonce/
           An 64 bit random integer generated by the server.

           EXAMPLE expressed in hexadecimal:

               15F0D2278BCD457F

   3.   Let /location/ be the string that results from constructing a
        WebSocket URL from /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure
        flag/.

   4.   Let /server digest/ be the 16 octets of MD5 digest of the
        concatenation of /client nonce/, the ASCII string "WebSocket" and
        /server nonce/

        EXAMPLE expressed in hexadecimal:

            Ee7eBe0c369cBf255a4451Fc58D7Cc4f

   13.  Send the octets 0x8F, 0x18, /server nonce/ and /server digest/.

   14.  The *WebSocket connection is accepted*.  Now the server may
        send messages to the connection as described in the next section.

   15.  Read eighteen octets from the server.  Let /client hello/ be those bytes.

        If the connection closes before these bytes are received, then
        fail the WebSocket connection and abort these steps.

   48.  If the first octet of /client hello/ is not 0x8f then fail the WebSocket
        connection and abort these steps.

        If the second octet of /client hello/ is not 0x10 then fail the WebSocket
        connection and abort these steps.

   50.  Let /client expected/ be the 16 octets of MD5 digest of the
        concatenation of /server nonce/, the ASCII string "WebSocket" and
        /client nonce/

        EXAMPLE expressed as a hexadecimal number:

            33122035D11258Fd7c764314580e539c

        Let /client digest/ be the 16 octets starting from the third
        octet of /client hello/

   51.  If /client digest/ does not equal /client expected/ then fail
        the WebSocket connection and abort these steps.

   52.  The *WebSocket connection is established*.  Now the server
        may send and receive to and from the connection as described in
        the next section.

14.  Security Considerations

15.  IANA Considerations

   This requirements document does not mandate any IANA actions.

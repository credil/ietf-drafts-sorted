Abstract

   This document defines the Wrapped ESP (WESP) Extensions
   capability, which builds on the Wrapped Encapsulating Security
   Payload [WESP]. The extensions described in this document enable
   applications like operations and management as well as traffic
   inspection by intermediate nodes for value added network
   services such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS) on
   traffic that is encrypted.

1. Introduction

   This document defines an extension mechanism for Wrapped ESP
   (WESP) [WESP].

   The document is consistent with the operation of ESP in NAT
   environments [RFC3947].

   The design principles for this extension to WESP are:

   o  Provide an extensible packet format to enable better
   diagnostics and future innovation in IPsec.

   o  Leverage packet extensions to convey encryption offsets (if
   used), allowing visibility into packet headers, while still
   protecting the packet payload and its integrity.

1.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2. Applicability Statement

   The document is applicable only to wrapped ESP [WESP].

2. Wrapped ESP (WESP) Header Extensions format

   Wrapped ESP encapsulation (WESP) follows RFC 4303 [RFC4303] for
   all IPv6 and IPv4 considerations (e.g., alignment
   considerations) within ESP, and these considerations apply
   equally to the WESP Extensions mechanisms defined in this
   document.

   The WESP Extension is present if the 'X' (eXtension) flag in the
   WESP Header Flags field is set. If so, the WESP extension
   payload is inserted between the WESP Header and the ESP
   encapsulation.

   This may be depicted as follows:

  0                   1                   2                   3

           Figure 2 Detailed WESP Packet Format with Extensions



   Where:

   All fields in the WESP Header are as defined in [WESP], except
   for the Flags field in which one additional bit is used to
   signal the use of WESP extensions as follows:

   Flags, 8 bits: The bits are defined LSB first, so bit 0 is the
   least significant bit of the flags octet. [WESP]

   <Do we need to rev the WESP version number?>

       1 bit: Extensions Present (X).  Setting the Extensions
   Present bit to 1 indicates that WESP Extensions are present
   between the WESP Header and the ESP Header (as shown above). The
   recipient MUST ensure consistency of this flag with the
   negotiated policy and MUST drop the incoming packet otherwise.

       3 bits: Flags, reserved for future use.  The flags MUST be
   sent as 0, and ignored by the receiver. Otherwise, these flags
   are treated per [WESP].

   The fields in the WESP Extension allow the definition of options
   with the following format:

   Type, 8 bits: defines the WESP Extension type

   Length, 8 bits: defines the length of the WESP Extension in
   octets, excluding the Type and Length fields

Montenegro, et. al.      Expires May 9, 2010               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             WESP Extensions            November 2009


   Data, variable length: defines the value(s) associated with a
   given WESP Extension. The length is defined by the Length field
   above.

   Furthermore, the Type contains some fixed format bits, following
   RFC 2460, clause 4.2 to ensure consistency with IPv6 extension
   header encoding. This will allow simple and consistent hardware-
   based parsing of the WESP Extensions. [RFC2460]

   Accordingly, the high order 2 bits specify the following
   behavior when the option is not recognized.

   00 - silently skip the option

   01 - silently discard the packet

   10 - discard and send ICMP parameter error

   11 - discard and send ICMP parameter error if not multicast



   The next high order bit specifies mutability of the option
   field.

   0 - option data does not change en-route. This option is
   included in the WESP ICV computation.

   1 - option data may change en-route. This option is excluded
   from the ICV computation.

   The possibility of using WESP Extensions applies equally to the
   UDP Encapsulation of WESP.

2.1. Operation Administration and Maintenance (OAM) Options


  In its most common implementation, IPsec uses different protocols for
  key negotiation (IKE over UDP port 500/4500) and traffic
  encapsulation (ESP, UDP-ESP(NAT-T), or AH). Having different control
  and data channels can make troubleshooting connectivity difficult.
  The various OAM options enable the monitoring of connectivity within
  the data channel.

  OAM options can potentially be generated for every packet. It is up
  to the implementation to properly keep this traffic within reasonable

Montenegro, et. al.      Expires May 9, 2010               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             WESP Extensions            November 2009


  bounds, e.g by piggybacking OAM options onto existing packets or
  throttling the generation of OAM options.

2.1.1. Connectivity Verification Option (OAM-CV)

  The OAM-CV option allows a sender to test for connectivity to a
  remote peer over an IPsec SA.

  OAM-CV is a zero-length option. The OAM-CV option is immutable.

  0                   1
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |  Type (OAM-CV)|    0          |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  The recipient of an OAM CV option MUST add the OAM CV option to the
  first subsequent packet that is small enough to hold it, or generate
  an empty packet after a timeout.

2.1.2. Error Notification Option (OAM-EN)

  The OAM-EN option is used to notify communicating peers of an error
  in the path. The OAM-EN option can be generated by the end host or by
  an intermediary (e.g. an intermediary dropping a packet because of
  policy restrictions on the type of traffic that can go through it).
  An intermediary generating an OAM-EN option SHOULD forward it to both
  the source and destination of the packet triggering the error.

  The OAM-EN option is mutable, hence not included in the integrity
  check for a packet.

  Error Code, 2 octets: A code indicating the nature of the error.
  Extended Information, variable length: Additional error code specific
  information.

  The currently defined error codes are:

  Error Code       Value     generated by        Extended Information
  ==========       =====     ============        ==================
  RESERVED         0         N/A                 N/A
  NO_SA            1         end node            N/A
  ADMIN_PROHIB      2         end node,           IP address (optional)
                             intermediary
  NOT_PARSED       3         intermediary        IP address (optional)

  Types 4-16383 are reserved to IANA. Values 16384-32767 are for
  private use among mutually consenting parties.

  The NO_SA error code SHOULD be sent by an end node in an empty packet
  when it receives a packet which cannot match the corresponding SA.

  The ADMIN_PROHIB error code indicates that the packet has been
  dropped by a firewalling policy. If the end node drops the packet, it
  SHOULD send back the ADMIN_PROHIB error code with no extended
  information to the sender. If an intermediary node drops the packet,
  it SHOULD send the ADMIN_PROHIB error code with its IP address in the
  extended information to both the sender and the end node.

  The NOT_PARSED error code indicates that an intermediary was not able
  to correctly parse the packet and dropped it. This typically happens
  when an intermediary requires all traffic to be NULL encrypted and
  receives an encrypted packet. The intermediary SHOULD then send the
  ADMIN_PROHIB error code with its IP address in the extended
  information to both the sender and the end node.

2.1.3. SA Monitoring Option (OAM-SM)

  The OAM-SM option is used to report statistics on the current SA
  usage. It is patterned after [RFC1989].

  The OAM-SM option is immutable.

  Length, 8 bits: defines the length of the pad in octets, excluding
  the type and length fields.
  PAD Data, variable: defines the pad value (the exact data used to pad
  is implementation dependent).

  The purpose of this option is to allow additional data obfuscation

  Type: Encryption Offset (EO) option identifier (value TBD)
  Length: 2 octets
  Offset: Defines the encryption offset in octets. This is the number
  of octets that are not encrypted (but integrity protected) from the
  beginning of the payload data.

  The purpose of this option is to allow additional visibility into the
  payload data, when a given encryption scheme is used. The exact value
  of the offset is negotiated via the control channel handshake. This
  option can be used in scenarios where intermediate devices require
  visibility into headers of upper layer protocols (TCP/UDP headers),
  without compromising the confidentiality of the application payload.




3. IKE Considerations

   This document assumes that WESP Extensions negotiation is
   performed using IKEv2. In order to negotiate WESP extensions
   support via IKEv2 [RFC4306], both parties need to agree to
   support the WESP extensions. This requirement assumes that both
   parties are already able to negotiate and support WESP. The WESP
   extensions negotiation can be achieved using a notification
   method similar to USE_TRANSPORT_MODE defined in RFC 4306.

   The notification, USE_WESP_EXTENSIONS (value TBD) MAY be
   included in a request message that also includes an SA payload
   requesting a CHILD_SA using WESP.  It requests that the CHILD_SA
   use WESP extensions for the SA created.  If the request is
   accepted, the response MUST also include a notification of type
   USE_WESP_EXTENSIONS. If the responder declines the request, the
   CHILD_SA will be established without WESP extensions.  If this
   is unacceptable to the initiator, the initiator MUST delete the
   SA.

4. Security Considerations

   TBD

5. IANA Considerations

   This specification requests that IANA assign the 'X' bit for
   Extensions Present (as shown above) out of the "WESP Flags"
   field.

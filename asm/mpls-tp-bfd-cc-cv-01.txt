   Abstract 

   Continuity Check (CC), Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) and 
   Remote Defect Indication (RDI) functionalities are MPLS-TP OAM 
   requirements listed in [3]. 
    
   Continuity Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of the path 
   for any loss of continuity defect. Connectivity verification monitors 
   the integrity of the routing of the path between sink and source for 
   any connectivity issues. RDI enables an End Point to report, to its 
   associated End Point, a fault or defect condition that it detects on 
   a PW, LSP or Section. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that a protocol solution, meeting one or more 
   functional requirement(s), be the same for PWs, LSPs and Sections as 
   per [3]. 
    
   This document specifies methods for proactive CV, CC, and RDI for 
   MPLS-TP Label Switched Path (LSP), PWs and Sections using 
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).

1. Introduction 

   In traditional transport networks, circuits are provisioned on 
   multiple switches. Service Providers (SP) need OAM tools to detect 
   mis-connectivity and loss of continuity of transport circuits. MPLS-
   TP LSPs [11] emulating traditional transport circuits need to provide 
   the same CC and proactive CV capabilities as mentioned in [3]. This 
   document describes the use of BFD [7] for CC, proactive CV, and RDI 
   of an MPLS-TP LSP between two Maintenance End Points (MEPs). 

   The mechanism specified in this document is restricted only to BFD 
   asynchronous mode. 

   The proposed method uses BFD state machine defined in Section 6.2 of 
   [7] for bidirectional p2p connections and uses the p2mp BFD state 
   machine defined in [8] for p2p unidirectional and p2mp unidirectional 
   transport path. 

   As described in [4], Continuity Check (CC) and Proactive Connectivity 
   Verification (CV) functions are used to detect loss of continuity 
   (LOC), unintended connectivity between two MEPs (e.g. mismerging or 
   misconnection or unexpected MEP).  

   The Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is an indicator that is 
   transmitted by a MEP to communicate to its peer MEPs that a signal 
   fail condition exists. RDI is only used for bidirectional connections 
   and is associated with proactive CC & CV packet generation. 

   The main goal here is to specify the BFD extension and behaviour to 
   satisfy the CC, proactive CV monitoring and the RDI functionality.

3. MPLS-TP CC, proactive CV and RDI Mechanism using BFD 

   This document proposes two modes of BFD operation  

  o  CC mode: uses the existing ACH code point (0x0007) and BFD ACH 
     packet encapsulation (BFD without IP/UDP headers ) as defined in 
     [6]. In this mode Continuity Check and RDI functionalities are 
     supported. 

  o  CV/CC mode: defines a new code point in the Associated Channel 
     Header (ACH) described in [2]. Under MPLS label stack of the MPLS-
     TP LSP, the ACH with "MPLS-TP Proactive CV/CC" code point 
     indicates that the message is an MPLS-TP BFD proactive CV and CC 
     message.

   from the PW Associated Channel Type registry.] 

   In this mode Continuity Check, Connectivity Verifications and RDI  
   functionalities are supported. 

   Editor's Note: 

   1) CV/CC mode require extension of CV types, foreseen by [5] and yet 
      extended by [6], in order to include the MPLS-TP OAM mechanism 
      too for PW Fault Detection only. This is due to the fact that 
      VCCV also includes mechanisms for negotiating the control channel 
      and connectivity verification (i.e. OAM functions) between PEs. 

   2) Does also the CC mode for MPLS-TP require such extension ? 

   3) Shall we trace that in this document ? 

   EndofEditorNote 

    

   Both CC and CV/CC modes apply to PWs, MPLS LSPs (including tandem 
   connection monitoring), and Sections 

   It's possible to run the BFD in CC mode on some transport paths 
   and the BFD in CV/CC mode on other transport paths. In any case, 
   only one tool for OAM instance at time, configurable by 
   operator, can run.

                     Figure 2: MPLS-TP CV/CC Message 
    

   As shown in Figure 2, BFD Control packet as defined in [7] is 
   transmitted as MPLS labeled packets along with ACH, ACH TLV Header 
   defined in Section 3 of RFC 5586 and one ACH TLV object carrying the 
   unique MEP Identifier of the source of the BFD packet defined in [12] 

   When GAL label is used, the TTL field of the GAL MUST be set to at 
   least 1, and the GAL will be the end of stack label. 

3.3. BFD Session in MPLS-TP terminology 

   A BFD session corresponds to a CC or a proactive CV/CC OAM instance 
   in MPLS-TP terminology. 

 
Fulignoli et al.,       Expires April 26, 2010                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft      draft-asm-mpls-tp-bfd-cc-cv-00         October 2009 
 

   A BFD session is enabled when the CC or proactive CV/CC functionality 
   is enabled on a configured Maintenance Entity (ME). 

   An enabled BFD session can be in DOWN, INIT or UP state as detailed 
   in [7] for p2p bidirectional connections and in [8] for 
   unidirectional p2p and p2mp connections. 

   When on a ME the CC or proactive CV/CC functionality is disabled, the 
   BFD session transits in the ADMIN DOWN State and the BFD session 
   ends. 

   A new BFD session is initiated when the operator enables or re-
   enables the CC or CV/CC functionality on the same ME. 

    

3.4. BFD Profile for MPLS-TP 

   BFD MUST run in asynchronous mode as described in [7]. In this mode, 
   the BFD Control packets are periodically sent at configurable time 
   rate   

   BFD state machine is defined in [7] for p2p bidirectional transport 
   path and in [8] for unidirectional p2p and p2mp transport path. 

   BFD session is declared Down: 

     If an unexpected MEP identifier is received (mis-connectivity 
     defect) 

     If timer and detect multiplier re-negotiation is disabled and an 
     unexpected desired min Tx interval field value or unexpected 
     detect multiplier field are received (Unexpected period defect).  

     If BFD session times out (Loss of Connectivity) 

    

   Traffic MUST not be affected when proactive CV/CC or CC monitoring 
   is enabled/disabled by an operator on a configured MEP or when a BFD 
   session transits from one state to another as per [4]. 

    

   The diagram in Figure 1 provides an overview of the state machine for 
   MEP configured on p2p bidirectional transport path, as defined in 
   [7].

   Editor's Note 

   In unidirectional p2p o p2mp the DOWN State in the received BFD could 
   be removed as State transitions on MEP Source on unidirectional p2p 
   and p2mp path are administratively driven. Action should be taken in 
   [8]. 

   EndofEditor'Note 

   In both diagram, each arc represents the state of the remote 
   system (as received in the State field in the BFD Control 
   packet) or indicates the expiration of the Detection Timer, here 
   extended to the occurrence of one or more of the following 
   defect: mis-connectivity, Unexpected period, Loss of 
   Connectivity 

   The raising and clearing conditions of defects identified by the 
   proactive Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification 
   functionality are as per [4] 

   As reported in [7], another state (AdminDown) exists so that the 
   BFD session can be administratively put down indefinitely. In 
   the above diagram Transitions involving AdminDown state are 
   deleted for clarity. 

   The AdminDown state semantic is equivalent to disabling on a MEP 
   the CC-CV proactive monitoring; in this case the source MEP 
   SHOULD send BFD Control packets in AdminDown state for a period 
   equal to(bfd.DesiredMinTxInterval * bfd.DetectMult) in order to 
   ensure that the remote system is aware of the state change.  

   Editor's Note: 

   The behaviour of the sink MEP, i.e the MEP receiving a BFD packet 
   with AdminDown State, will be detailed in a next revision of the 
   draft.

   TX Interval field". For a bidirectional p2p transport path the 
   "Required Min RX Interval field" MUST be the same as "Desired Min TX 
   Interval field". The source MEP of an unidirectional p2p and p2mp 
   session MUST set the "Required Min RX Interval field " to 0. 

   The default timer values to be used based on what's recommended in 
   [4]. 

3.4.2. Discriminator values 

   In the BFD control packet the discriminator values have either local 
   or no significance.  

   My discriminator field MUST be set to a nonzero value (it can be a 
   fixed value), the transmitted your discriminator value MUST reflect 
   back the received value of My discriminator field or be set to 0 if 
   that value is not known yet. 

3.5. Remote Detection Indication (RDI) 

   The BFD Diagnostic (Diag) field defined in [8] can be used for this 
   functionality. 

   On MEP mismatch, loss of connectivity or unexpected timer and 
   unexpected detect multiplier a MEP sends to its peer MEP a BFD packet 
   with the Diagnostic (Diag) field value set to 1 (corresponding to the 
   "Control Detection Time Expired"). 

   In order to help debugging, it is also possible to use one of the 
   following diagnostic code that indicate RDI condition: 

      - TBD: Unexpected MEP 

      - TBD: Unexpected timer and unexpected detect multiplier  

    

   The value 0 indicates RDI condition has been cleared.

4. Operation 

   For p2p bidirectional LSPs, both endpoints of the bidirectional MPLS-
   TP LSP MUST send BFD messages in-band in the MPLS-TP LSP using the 
   defined code point. 

   When on a configured bidirectional transport path the proactive CV/CC 
   or CC monitoring is enabled, each MEP sends the BFD Control Packets 
   at the rate of the configured transmission period and each MEP 
   expects to receive the BFD packets from its peer MEP at the same rate 
   as per [4]. 

   MPLS labels at both MEPs are used to provide context for the received 
   BFD packets. 

   Active role is the default behavior, passive role is optional. 

    

   In Active role both MEPs start sending initial BFD Control Packets 
   with the State field set to "Down" value and with "Your 
   discriminator" field set to zero. 

   When timer negotiation is disabled, timer parameters are configured 
   by the operator and statically  provisioned or signaled by the 
   control plane; the timer configured value are carried inside the BFD 
   packets and this value never change unless modified by operator; the 
   new timer configuration must be statically provisioned or signaled by 
   the control plane. 

   Open issue:    

      - shall a source MEP send the BFD Control Packets  at the 
   configured transmission rate in any BFD session State   

    or 

      - shall a source MEP send one BFD Control Packet per second 
   starting xx seconds after entering the Down state and prior to 
   entering the Init state ?  

    

   The details of the BFD state machine are as per Section 6.2 of [7] 
   for bidirectional p2p transport path; the following scenario 
   exemplifies the operation and is aligned with [6] section 3.1.

  o  If a MEP-B in Figure 3 detects one of the following faults (miss-
     connectivity, Unexpected Period or loss of continuity) from its 
     peer MEP, it declares that the transport path in its receive 
     direction is down (in other words, MEP-B enters the "receive 
     defect" state for this transport path) and signals it to its peer 
     MEP (MEP-A) sending  the BFD packets with State (Sta) field set to 
     "Down" and Diagnostic code 1 (RDI)  

  o  In turn, the peer MEP (MEP-A) declares the transport path is down 
     in its transmit direction, (in other words, MEP-A enters the 
     "transmit defect" state for this transport path) setting the State 
     (Sta field ) to Down with Diagnostic code 3 (Neighbor signaled 
     session down) in its BFD packets towards MEP-B. Please note that 
     if the failure is unidirectional, i.e. only from A to B direction 
     as in Figure 1. MEP-A, transits first to Down State but then to 
     Init state as it still receives BFD packets from its peer MEP B.  

4.1. Unidirectional p2p or p2mp transport path. 

  o  In a unidirectional (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint) 
     transport path, where the proactive CV/CC or CC monitoring is 
     enabled, only the Source MEP is enabled to generate BFD control 
     packets with rate of the operator configured transmission period, 
     with the State field always set to "UP" and with "Your 
     discriminator" field always set to zero.  

  Editor's note : This last setting requires modification on [8] 
  section 4.16.2. 

  EndofEditorNote 

     The multipoint BFD control packets are explicitly marked as such, 
     via the setting of the M bit (see [8]).  

     The Source MEP does not expect to receive any BFD packets from its 
     peer MEP(s), as such all state transitions are administratively 
     driven.

  o  A MEP Sink, configured on a unidirectional transport path where 
     the proactive CV and CC monitoring is enabled, expects to receive 
     the BFD packets from its peer MEP at the operator configured 
     period; the defects detection procedure is the same as the 
     bidirectional MEP.

7. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further 
   study. 

   Base BFD foresees an optional authentication section (see [7] 
   section 6.7); that can be extended also to the tool proposed in 
   this document. 

   Authentication methods that require checksum calculation on the 
   outgoing packet must extend the checksum also on the ME 
   Identifier Section. This is possible but seems uncorrelated with 
   the solution proposed in this document: it could be better to 
   use the simple password authentication method.

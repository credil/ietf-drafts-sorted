Internet-Draft               OAuth Use Cases              September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The need for documenting the OAuth use cases was discussed at the
   oauth WG virtual meetings, on the group's mailing list, and at the
   IETF 77 and IETF 78.  This Internet-Draft describes such use cases.
   The objective of the draft is to initiate discussion that will lead
   to defining a set of the use cases that the OAuth specifications
   should support.  The following section provides the abbreviated
   descriptions of the use cases.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  OAuth use cases

   This section lists the use cases that have been discussed by the
   oauth WG.

3.1.  Web server

   Description:

   Alice accesses an application running on a web server at
   www.printphotos.example.com and instructs it to print her photographs
   that are stored on a server www.storephotos.example.com.  The
   application at www.printphotos.example.com receives Alice's
   authorization for accessing her photographs without learning her
   authentication credentials with www.storephotos.example.com.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has registered with www.storephotos.example.com to enable
      authentication

   o  The application at www.printphotos.example.com has established
      authentication credentials with the application at
      www.storephotos.example.com

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in the application
   www.printphotos.example.com receiving an authorization code from
   www.storephotos.example.com.  The code is bound to the application at

Internet-Draft               OAuth Use Cases              September 2010


   www.printphotos.example.com and to the callback URL supplied by the
   application.  The application at www.printphotos.example.com uses the
   authorization code for obtaining an access token from
   www.storephotos.example.com.  The application at
   www.storephotos.example.com issues an access token after
   authenticating the application at www.printphotos.example.com and
   validating the authorization code that it has submitted.  The
   application at www.printphotos.example.com uses the access token for
   getting access to Alice's photographs at www.storephotos.example.com.

   Note: When an access token expires, the service at
   www.printphotos.example.com needs to repeat the OAuth procedure for
   getting Alice's authorization to access her photographs at
   www.storephotos.example.com.  Alternatively, if Alice wants to grant
   the application a long lasting access to her resources at
   www.storephotos.example.com, the authorization server associated with
   www.storephotos.example.com may issue the long-living tokens.  Those
   tokens can be exchanged for short-living access tokens required to
   access www.storephotos.example.com.

   Requirements:

   o  The server www.printphotos.example.com, which hosts an OAuth
      client, must be capable of issuing the HTTP redirect requests to
      Alice's user agent - a browser

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example.com must be able to
      authenticate Alice.  The authentication method is not in the OAuth
      scope

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example.com must obtain Alice's
      authorization of the access to her photos by
      www.printphotos.example.com

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example.com may identify to Alice
      the scope of access that www.printphotos.example.com has requested
      while asking for Alice's authorization

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example.com must be able to
      authenticate the application at www.printphotos.example.com and
      validate the authorization code before issuing an access token

   o  Application at www.printphotos.example.com must provide a callback
      URL to the application at www.storephotos.example.com (note: the
      URL can be pre-registered with www.storephotos.example.com)

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example.com is required to maintain
      a record that associates the authorization code with the



Lodderstedt & Zeltsan    Expires March 31, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               OAuth Use Cases              September 2010


      application at www.printphotos.example.com and the callback URL
      provided by the application

   o  Access tokens are bearer's tokens (they are not associated with a
      specific application, such as www.printphotos.example.com) and
      should have a short lifespan

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example.com must invalidate the
      authorization code after its first use

   o  Alice's manual involvement in the OAuth authorization procedure
      (e.g., entering an URL or a password) should not be required.
      (Alice's authentication to www.storephotos.example.com is not in
      the OAuth scope)

3.2.  User-agent

   Description:

   Alice has installed on her computer a gaming application.  She keeps
   her scores in a database of a social site at www.fun.example.com.  In
   order to upload Alice's scores, the application gets access to the
   database with her authorization.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has installed a gaming application implemented in a
      scripting language (e.g., JavaScript) that runs in her browser and
      uses OAuth for accessing a social site at www.fun.example.com

   o  There is no a web site supporting this application and capable of
      handling the OAuth flow

   o  The installed application is registered with the social site at
      www.fun.example.com and has an identifier

   o  Alice has registered with www.fun.example.com for identification
      and authentication

   o  An auxiliary web server at www.help.example.com is reachable by
      Alice's browser and capable of providing a script that extracts an
      access token from an URL's fragment

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in Alice's browser receiving an access
   token.  The access token is received from www.fun.example.com as a
   fragment of a redirection URL of an auxiliary web server



Lodderstedt & Zeltsan    Expires March 31, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               OAuth Use Cases              September 2010


   www.help.example.com.  Alice's browser follows the redirection, but
   retains the fragment.  From the auxiliary web server at
   www.help.example.com Alice's browser downloads a script that extracts
   access token from the fragment and makes it available to the gaming
   application.  The application uses the access token to gain access to
   Alice's data at www.fun.example.com.

   Requirements:

   o  Registration of the application running in the Alice's browser
      with the application running on www.fun.example.com is required
      for identification

   o  Alice's authentication with www.fun.example.com is required

   o  Application running at www.fun.example.com must be able to
      describe to Alice the request made by the gaming application
      running on her computer and obtain Alice's authorization for or
      denial of the requested access

   o  After obtaining Alice's authorization the application running at
      www.fun.example.com must respond with an access token and redirect
      Alice's browser to a web server (e.g., www.help.example.com) that
      is capable of retrieving an access token from an URL

3.3.  Mobile App

   Description:

   Alice wants to upload (or download) her photographs to (or from)
   storephotos.example.com using her smartphone.  She downloads and
   installs a photo app on her smartphone.  In order to enable the app
   to access her photographs, Alice needs to authorize the app to access
   the web site on her behalf.  The authorization shall be valid for a
   prolonged duration (e.g. several months), so that Alice does not need
   to authenticate and authorize access on every execution of the app.
   It shall be possible to withdraw the app's authorization both on the
   smartphone as well as on the site storephotos.example.com.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has installed a (native) photo app application on her
      smartphone

   o  The installed application is registered with the social site at
      storephotos.example.com and has an identifier

Internet-Draft               OAuth Use Cases              September 2010


   o  Alice holds an account with storephotos.example.com

   o  Authentication and authorization shall be performed in a
      interactive, browser-based process

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in Alice's app receiving an access and
   a refresh token.  The app may obtain the tokens by utilizing either
   the web server or the user agent flow.  The application uses the
   access token to gain access to Alice's data at
   storephotos.example.com.  The refresh token is persistently stored on
   the device for use in sub-sequent app executions.  If a refresh token
   exists on app startup, the app directly uses the refresh token to
   obtain a new access token.

   Requirements:

   o  Alice's authentication with www.fun.example.com is required

   o  Registration of the application running on Alice's smartphone is
      required for identification and registration and may be carried
      out on a per installation base

   o  The application at storephotos.example.com provides a capability
      to view and delete the apps' authorizations.  This implies that
      the different installations of the same app on the different
      devices can be distinguished (e.g., by a device name or a
      telephone number)

   o  The app must provide Alice an option to logout.  The logout must
      result in the revocation of the refresh token on the authorization
      server

   o

3.4.  Device

   Description:

   Alice has a device, such as a game console, that does not support an
   easy data-entry method.  She also has an access to a computer with a
   browser.  The application running on the Alice's device gets
   authorized access to a protected resource (e.g., photographs) stored
   on a server at www.storephotos.example.com.

   Pre-conditions:

Internet-Draft               OAuth Use Cases              September 2010


   o  Alice uses an Oauth-enabled game console, which does not have an
      easy data-entry method, for accessing her photographs at
      www.storephotos.example.com.  The token issuance process is
      initiated at the device.

   o  Alice is able to connect to www.storephotos.example.com using a
      separate device providing an easy data-entry method (e.g.,
      computer), which is equipped with a browser.  This device is used
      to authorize access by the application running on the game console
      to Alice's photographs.

   o  Application running on Alice's game console has registered with
      www.storephotos.example.com (has been issued an identifier)

   o  Alice has registered with the application running at
      www.storephotos.example.com for identification and authentication

   Post-conditions: Description:

   A successful procedure results in the application running on Alice's
   game console receiving an access token that enables access to the
   photographs on www.storephotos.example.com.

   Requirements:

   o  Registration of the application running on the game console with
      the application running on www.storephotos.example.com is required
      for identification

   o  Application running on the game console must be able to poll
      periodically the application running at
      www.storephotos.example.com while waiting for Alice's
      authorization of the requested access to her photographs.  The
      repeating requests include the application's identifier and the
      verification code that has been issued by
      www.storephotos.example.com

   o  Alice is required to use her browser for interacting with the web
      application running on www.storephotos.example.com.  To that end
      she has to manually direct her browser to the verification URL
      that is displayed on her game console

   o  Alice's authentication with www.storephotos.example.com is
      required

   o  After authentication with www.storephotos.example.com Alice, if
      she wishes to approve the request, which is described in her
      browser's window, must enter the user code.  (The user code is

   www.storephotos.example.com, while serving the request of the
   application at www.printphotos.example.com, discovers that some of
   the requested photographs have been moved to
   www.storephotos1.example.com.  The application at
   www.storephotos.example.com retrieves the missing photographs from
   www.storephotos1.example.com and provides access to all requested
   photographs to the application at www.printphotos.example.com.  The
   application at www.printphotos.example.com carries out Alice's
   request.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  The application running on www.printphotos.example.com is capable
      of interacting with Alice's browser

   o  The applications at www.printphotos.example.com and
      www.storephotos.example.com require different access tokens

   o  The application at www.printphotos.example.com is required to
      provide its callback URL to the application at
      www.storephotos.example.com

   o  Authentication of the application at www.printphotos.example.com
      to the authorization server is required

   o  Alice's authentication by the authorization server is required

   o  The authorization server must be able to describe to Alice the
      request of the application at www.printphotos.example.com and
      obtain her authorization (or rejection)

   o  If Alice has authorized the request, the authorization server must
      be able to issue an access token that enables the application at
      www.printphotos.example.com to get access to Alice's photographs
      at www.storephotos.example.com

   o  The authorization server must be able, based on the access token
      presented by the application at www.printphotos.example.com, to
      generate another access token that allows the application at
      www.storephotos.example.com to get access to the photographs at
      www.storephotos1.example.com.  In this context the authorization
      server must validate the authorization of the application at
      www.storephotos.example.com to obtain the token.

   o  The application at www.storephotos.example.com must be able to
      validate an access token presented by the application running at
      www.printphotos.example.com

   o  The application at www.storephotos1.example.com must be able to
      validate the access token presented by the application running at
      www.storephotos.example.com

3.9.  Multiple access tokens

   Description:

   Alice uses a communicator application running on a web server at
   www.communicator.example.com to access her email service at
   www.email.example.com and her voice over IP service at
   www.voip.example.com.  Email addresses and telephone numbers are
   obtained from Alice's address book at www.contacts.example.com.
   Those web sites all rely on the same authorization server, so the
   application at www.communicator.example.com can receive a single

   authorization from Alice for getting access to these three services
   on her behalf at once.

   Note: This use case is especially useful for native applications
   since a web browser needs to be launched only once.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  The same authorization server serves Alice and all involved
      servers

   o  Alice has registered with the authorization server for
      authentication and for authorization of the requests of the
      communicator application running at www.communicator.example.com

   o  The email application at www.email.example.com has registered with
      the authorization server for authentication

   o  The VoIP application at www.voip.example.com has registered with
      the authorization server for authentication

   o  The address book at www.contacts.example.com has registered with
      the authorization server for authentication

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in the application at
   www.communicator.example.com receiving three different access tokens:
   one for accessing the email service at www.email.example.com, one for
   accessing the contacts at www.contacts.example.com, and one for
   accessing the VoIP service at www.voip.example.com.

   Requirements:

   o  The application running at www.communicator.example.com must be
      authenticated by the authorization server

   o  Alice must be authenticated by the authorization server

   o  The application running at www.communicator.example.com must be
      able to get a single Alice's authorization for access to the
      multiple services (e.g., email and VoIP)

   o  The application running at www.communicator.example.com must be
      able to recognize that all three applications rely on the same
      authorization server

   o  A callback URL of the application running at
      www.communicator.example.com must be known to the authorization
      server

   o  The authorization server must be able to issue the separate
      service-specific tokens (with different, scope, permissions, and
      expiration dates) for access to the requested services (such as
      email and VoIP)

3.10.  Gateway for browser-based VoIP applets

   Description:

   Alice accesses a social site on a web server at
   www.social.example.com.  Her browser loads a VoIP applet that enables
   her to make a VoIP call using her SIP server at
   www.sipservice.example.com.  The application at
   www.social.example.com gets Alice's authorization to use her account
   with www.sipservice.example.com without learning her authentication
   credentials with www.sipservice.example.com.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has registered with www.sipservice.example.com for
      authentication

   o  The application at www.social.example.com has established
      authentication credentials with the application at
      www.storephotos.example.com

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in the application at
   www.social.example.com receiving access token from
   www.sipservice.example.com with Alice's authorization.

   Requirements:

   o  The server at www.social.example.com must be able to redirect
      Alice's browser to www.sipservice.example.com

   o  The application running at www.sipservice.example.com must be
      capable of authenticating Alice and obtaining her authorization of
      a request from www.social.example.com

   o  The server at www.sipservice.example.com must be able to redirect
      Alice's browser back to www.social.example.com

   o  The application at www.social.example.com must be able to
      translate the messages of the Alice's VoIP applet into SIP and RTP
      messages

   o  The application at www.social.example.com must be able to add the
      access token to the SIP requests that it sends to
      www.sipservice.example.com

   o  Application at www.sipservice.example.com must be able to
      authenticate the application at www.social.example.com and
      validate the access token

   o  Alice's manual involvement in the OAuth authorization procedure
      (e.g., entering an URL or a password) should not be required.
      (Alice's authentication to www.sipservice.example.com is not in
      the OAuth scope)

3.11.  Signature with asymmetric secret

   Description:

   Alice accesses an application running on a web server at
   www.printphotos.example.com and instructs it to print her photographs
   that are stored on a server www.storephotos.example.com.  The
   application at www.printphotos.example.com, which does not have a
   shared secret with www.storephotos.example.com, receives Alice's
   authorization for accessing her photographs without learning her
   authentication credentials with www.storephotos.example.com.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has registered with www.storephotos.example.com to enable
      authentication

   o  The application at www.printphotos.example.com has a private and a
      matching public keys

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in the application at
   www.printphotos.example.com receiving an access token for accessing
   the Alice's photographs at www.storephotos.example.com.

   Requirements:

   o  The application at www.printphotos.example.com must be capable of
      issuing the HTTP redirect requests to Alice's user agent - a

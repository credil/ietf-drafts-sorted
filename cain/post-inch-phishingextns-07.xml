    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format
      (IODEF) defined in RFC5070 to support the reporting of phishing events, which is a particular type of fraud.  These
      extensions are flexible enough to support information gleaned from
      activities throughout the entire electronic fraud cycle - from receipt of the phishing lure to the disablement of the collection site. Both
      simple reporting and complete forensic reporting are possible, as is
      consolidating multiple incidents .</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>Deception activities, such as receiving an email purportedly from a
      bank requesting you to confirm your account information, are an
      expanding attack type on the Internet. The terms phishing and fraud are
      used interchangeably in this document to characterize broadly-launched
      social engineering attacks in which an electronic identity is
      misrepresented in an attempt to trick individuals into revealing their
      personal credentials ( e.g., passwords, account numbers, personal
      information, ATM PINs, etc.). A successful phishing attack on an
      individual allows the phisher (i.e., the attacker) to exploit the
      individual's credentials for financial or other gain. Phishing attacks
      have morphed from directed email messages from alleged financial
      institutions to more sophisticated lures that may also include
      malware.</t>

      <t>This document defines a data format extension to the Incident Object
      Description Exchange Format (IODEF) <xref target="RFC5070"></xref> that
      can be used to describe information about a phishing or other type of
      fraudulent incident. Sections 2 of this document provide an overview of
      the terminology and process of a phishing event. Section3 introduces the
      high-level report format and how to use it. Sections 4 and 5 describe
      the data elements of the fraud extensions. The appendices includes an
      XML schema for the extensions and a few example fraud reports.</t>

      <t>The extensions defined in this document may be used to report the
      social engineering victim lure, the collections site, and credential
      targeted ('spear') phishing, broad multi-recipient phishing, and other
      evolving Internet-based fraud attempts. Malware and other malicious
      software included within the lure may also be included within the report</t>

      <section title="Why a Common Report Format is Needed">
        <t>To combat the rise in malicious activity on the Internet, service
        providers and investigative agencies are sharing more and more network
        and event data in a coordinated effort to identify perpetrators and
        compromised accounts, coordinate responses, and prosecute attackers.
        As the number of data sharing parties increases the number of
        party-specific tools, formats, and definitions multiply rapidly until
        it overwhelms the investigative and coordination abilities of those
        parties.</t>

        <t>By using a common format, it becomes easier for an organization to
        engage in this coordination as well as correlation of information from
        multiple data sources or products into a cohesive view. As the number
        of data sources increases, a common format becomes even more
        important, since multiple tools would be needed to interpret the
        different sources of data. A big win in a common format is the ability
        to automate many of the analysis tasks an significantly speed up the
        response and persecution activities.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Processing of Exchanged Data not Defined">
        <t>While the intended use of this specification is to facilitate data
        sharing between parties, the mechanics of this sharing process and its
        related political challenges are out of scope for this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Relation to the INCH IODEF Data Model">
        <t>Instead of defining a new report format, this draft defines an
        extension to <xref format="default" target="RFC5070"></xref>. The
        IODEF defines a flexible and extensible format and supports a granular
        level of specificity. These phishing and fraud extensions reuse
        subsets of the IODEF data model and, where appropriate, specifies new
        data elements. Leveraging an existing specification allows for more
        rapid adoption and reuse of existing tools in organizations. For
        clarity, and in order to eliminate duplication, only the additional
        structures necessary for describing the exchange of phishing and
        e-crime activity are provided.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Terminology Used in This Document">
      <t>Since many people use different but similar terms to mean the same
      thing, we use the following terminology in this document.</t>

      <t><list style="letters">
          <t>Phishing<list style="empty">
              <t>The overall process of identifying victims, contacting them
              via a lure, causing a victim to send a set of private
              credentials to a collection site, and storing those credentials
              is called phishing.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Fraud event<list style="empty">
              <t>A fraud event is the combination of Phishing and subsequent
              fraudulent use of the private credentials.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Lure<list style="empty">
              <t>A lure is the decoy used to trick a victim into performing
              some activity such as providing their private credentials. The
              lure relies on social engineering concepts to convince the
              victim that the lure is genuine and its instructions should be
              followed. A lure includes a pointer or link to a collection
              site.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Collection Site<list style="empty">
              <t>The web site, email box, SMS number, phone number, or other
              place where a phished victim sends their private credentials for
              later fraudulent use by a criminal.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Credentials<list style="empty">
              <t>A credential is data that is transferred or presented to
              establish either a claimed identity or the authorizations of a
              system entity. Many websites requires a user name and password
              -- combined they are a credential -- to access sensitive
              content.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Message<list style="empty">
              <t>Although primarily email, a Lure can be transported via any
              messaging medium such as Instant message, Voice Over IP, or text
              via an SMS service. The term message is used as a generic term
              for any of these transport mediums.</t>

        </figure>

        <t>Internet-based Phishing and Fraud activities are normally comprised
        of at least six components:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The Phisher, Fraudster, or party perpetrating the fraudulent
            activity. Most times this party is not readily identifiable.</t>

            <t>The Attack Source, the source of the phishing email, virus,
            trojan, or other attack is masked in an enticing manner.</t>

            <t>The Lure used to trick the victim into responding.</t>

            <t>The User, Victim, or intended target of the fraud or phish.</t>

            <t>The credentials, personal data, or other information the victim
            has surrendered to the phisher.</t>

            <t>The collection site, where the victim sends their credentials
            or personal data if they have been duped by the lure of the
            phisher. This may be a website, mailbox, phone operator, or a
            database.</t>
          </list>If we take a holistic view of the attack, there are some
        additional components:</t>

        <t><list counter="7" hangIndent="" style="symbols">
            <t>The sensor, the means by which the phish is detected. This
            element may be an intrusion detection system, firewall, filter,
            email gateway, or human analyst.</t>

            <t>A forensic or archive site (not pictured) where an investigator
            has copied or otherwise retained the data used for the fraud
            attempt or credential collection.</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="Fraudulent Activity Extensions to the IODEF-Document">
          <t>Fraud events are reported in a Fraud Activity Report which is an
          instance of an XML IODEF-Document Incident element with added
          EventData and AdditionalData elements. The additional fields in the
          EventData specific to phishing and fraud are enclosed into a
          PhraudReport XML element. Fraudulent activity may include multiple
          emails, instant messages, or network messages, scattered over
          various times, locations, and methodologies. The PhraudReport within
          an EventData may include information about the email header and
          body, details of the actual phishing lure, correlation to other
          attacks, and details of the removal of the web server or credential
          collector. As a phishing attack may generate multiple reports to an
          incident team, multiple PhraudReports may be combined into one
          EventData structure and multiple EventData structures may be
          combined into one Incident Report. One IODEF Incident report may
          record one or more individual phishing events and may include
          multiple EventData elements.</t>

          <t>This document defines new extension elements for the EventData
          and Record Item IODEF XML elements and identifies those required in
          a PhraudReport. The Appendices contain sample Fraud Activity Reports
          and a complete Schema.</t>

          <t>The IODEF Extensions defined in this document comply with section
          4, "Extending the IODEF Format" in <xref format="default"
          pageno="false" target="RFC5070"></xref>.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Useful Data Items In a Fraud Event">
        <t>There are a number of subtle and non-obvious datum to capture from
        a fraud event that makes the event analysis and correlation with other
        events more useful. These datum can be grouped into categories:</t>

        <section title="Data about the Lure">
          <t>If a lure was presented as part of the fraud event, this category
          includes the original received lure, the means that the lure was
          received ( e.g., email, phone, or SMS), and the source addresses
          that sent the lure. Other useful data includes DNS data about the
          lure source, identification of any accompanying malware, and the
          Brand name defrauded.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Credential Collection Site Data">
          <t>The collection site contains victim identifications along with
          copies of data supplied by the victims such as account names or
          numbers, passwords, date of birth, etc. This category of useful data
          includes these credentials along with information about the
          collections site itself such as its type, site DNS data, DNS
          registrant data, and site physical location. The location and
          registrant information is particularly important if law enforcement
          assistance is expected. Additionally, an entire site archive can be
          gathered to allow a collector on a shared web site to be disabled
          without impacting other users.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Detection Information">
          <t>This is a non-obvious data category and contains data on how the
          lure or collection site was detected. Understanding how the lure was
          detected allows us to design and implement better detection
          systems.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Analysis Output">
          <t>In an environment where time is critical, it is imperative that
          analysis from one party can be reliably explained and shared to
          other investigative parties. This grouping includes data that an
          investigator found interesting or could be useful to others.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Fraud Activity Reporting via IODEF-Documents"
             toc="default">
      <t>A Fraud Activity Report is an instance of an XML IODEF-Document with
      additional extensions and usage guidance as specified in Section 4 of
      this document. These additional extensions are implemented through the
      PhraudReport XML element.</t>

      <t>As described in the following sections, reporting Fraud Activity has
      three primary components: choosing a report type; a format for the data;
      and how to check correctness of the format.</t>

      <section title="Fraud Report Types">
        <t>There are three actions relating to reporting phishing events.
        First, a reporter may *create* and exchange a new report on a new
        event. Secondly, a reporter may *update* a previously exchanged report
        to indicate new collection sites, site take down information, or
        related activities. Lastly, a reporter may have realized that the
        report is in error or contain significant incorrect data and the
        prudent reaction is to *delete* the report.</t>

        <t>The three types of reports are denoted through the use of the
        ext-purpose attribute of an Incident element. A new report contains an
        empty or a "create" ext-purpose value; an updated report contains a
        ext-value value of "update"; a request for deletion contains a
        "delete" ext-purpose value. Note that this is actually an advisory
        marking for the report originator or recipient as operating procedures
        in a report life cycle is very environment specific.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Fraud Report XML Representation">
        <t>The IODEF Incident element [RFC5070, Section 3.2] is summarized
        below. It and the rest of the data model presented in Section 4 is
        expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) syntax as used in the
        IODEF specification. The UML representations is for illustrative
        purposes only; elements are specified in XML as defined in Appendix
        <xref format="counter" target="AppendixA"></xref></t>

      <section title="Reuse of IODEF-defined Elements">
        <t>Elements, attributes, and parameters defined in the base IODEF
        specification were used whenever possible in the definition of the
        PhraudReport XML element. This specification does not introduce any
        new variable types or encodings to the IODEF data model, but extends
        the IODEF Contact and System elements.</t>

        <t>The data model schema contains a copy of the iodef:System element.
        Although we would like to just extend the System element, it is
        defined in RFC5070 with an unable-to-extend anonymous type so we
        copied the element, named its underlying type, and then generated the
        extension to it.</t>

        <t>Note: Elements that are imported from the base IODEF specification
        are prefaced with an "iodef" XML namespace and are noted with the
        section defining that element in <xref target="RFC5070"></xref>. Each
        element in a PhraudReport is used as described in the following
        sections.</t>

      <section title="Element and Attribute Specification Format">
        <t>The following sections describe the components of a PhraudReport
        XML element. Each description is structured as follows.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>A terse XML-type identifier for the element or attribute.</t>

            <t>An indication of whether the element or attribute is REQUIRED
            or optional. Mandatory items are noted as REQUIRED. If not
            specified, elements are optional. Note that when optional elements

      <section title="Version attribute" toc="default">
        <t>REQUIRED. STRING. The version shall be the value 0.06 to be

        <t><cref>NOTE: This value will be changed to "1.0" when this document
        is approved.</cref></t>
      </section>

      <section title="FraudType attribute" toc="default">
        <t>REQUIRED. One ENUM. The FraudType attribute describes the type of
        fraudulent activity described in this PhraudReport. The FraudType
        chosen determines the value of the FraudParameter filed. This field
        contains one of the following values:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>phishing. The FraudParameter should be the subject line of the
            phishing lure email or value of a lure IM or VoIP message. This
            type is a standard phishing lure, usually sent as email, and is
            intended to derive financial loss to the recipient.</t>

            <t>recruiting. The FraudParameter is the subject line of the
            recruit, or mule, email or message.</t>

            <t>malware distribution. The FraudParameter is the email subject
            line of the phishing email. This type of email phish does not pose
            a potential financial loss to the recipient, but lures the
            recipient to an infected site.</t>

            <t>fraudulent site. This identifies a known fraudulent site that
            does not necessarily send spam but is used to show lures. The
            FraudParameter may be used to identify the website.</t>

            <t>dnsspoof. This choice does not have a related FraudParameter.
            This value is used when a DNS system component responses with an
            untrue IP address for the requested domain name due to either
            cache poisoning, ID spoofing, or other manipulation of the DNS
            system.</t>

            <t>archive. There is no required FraudParameter for this choice,
            although the FraudParameter of the original phish could be
            entered. The data archived from the phishing server is placed in
            the ArchiveInfo element.</t>

            <t>other. This is used to identify not-yet-enumerated fraud
            types.</t>

            <t>unknown. This choice may have an associated FraudParameter. It
            is used to cover confused cases.</t>

            <t>ext-value. This choice identifies an unidentified FraudType.
            The FraudType should be captured in the ext-value attribute.</t>

        <section title="FraudParameter element">
          <t>Zero or one value of iodef:MLStringType. The contents of this
          element are dependent on the FraudType choice. It may be an email
          subject line, VoIP lure, link in an IM message, or a web URL. Note
          that some phishers add a number of random characters onto the end of
          a phish email subject line for uniqueness; reporters should delete
          those characters before insertion into the FraudParameter field.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="PhishNameRef element">
        <t>Zero or one value of iodef:MLStringType. The PhishNameRef element is the common
        name used to identify this fraud event. It is often the name agreed
        upon by involved parties or vendors. Using this name can be a
        convenient way to reference the activity collaborating with other
        parties, the media, or engaging in public education.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="PhishNameLocalRef element">
        <t>Zero or one value of iodef:MLStringType. The PhishNameLocalRef element
        describes a local name or Unique-IDentifier (UID) that is used by
        various parties before a commonly agreed term is adopted. This field
        allows a cross-reference from the submitting organization's system to
        a central repository.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="FraudedBrandName element">
        <t>Zero or more values of iodef:MLStringType. This is the identifier
        of the recognized brand name or company name used in the phishing
        activity (e.g., XYZ Semiconductor Corp).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="LureSource element">
        <t>REQUIRED. One or more values. The LureSource element describes the
        source of the PhraudReport lure. It allows the specification of IP
        Addresses, DNS names, domain registry information, and rudimentary
        support for the files that might be downloaded or registry keys

          involved in the phishing activity. If the real IP Address can be
          ascertained, it should be populated. A spoofed address may also be
          entered and the spoofed attribute SHALL be set.</t>

      <t>A report about fraud or phishing requires certain identifying
      information which is contained within the standard IODEF Incident data
      structure and the PhraudReport extensions. The following table
      identifies attributes required to be present in a compliant PhraudReport
      to report phishing or fraud. The required attributes are a combination
      of those required by the base IODEF element, as shown in figure 6.1, and those required by this
      document, shown in figure 6.2. Attributes identified as required SHALL be populated in
      conforming phishing activity reports.</t>

      <t>A compliant IODEF PhraudReport SHALL contain the following
      elements and attributes:</t>

      <section title="Guidance on Usage" toc="default">
        <t>It may be apparent that the mandatory attributes for a PhraudReport
        make for a quite sparse report. As incident forensics and data
        analysis require detailed information, the originator of a
        PhraudReport SHOULD include any tidbit of information gleaned from the
        attack analysis. Information that is considered sensitive can be
        marked as such using the restriction parameter of each data
        element.</t>

        <t>The reporting party is encouraged to provide more than just the minimally required data elements about
        an event in a PhraudReport. The additional information may be
        volatile and not recoverable in the future, and may be useful in answering investigation
        questions or in performing correlation with other reported events.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
      security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations. As
      merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
      issues. However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances of
      this specification will have certain concerns. For this reason, the
      underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure the
      appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity for
      the specific environment.</t>

      <t>Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
      develop operating procedures that document the following areas of
      concern.</t>

      <section title="Transport-specific concerns">
        <t>The critical security concerns are that phishing activity reports
        may be falsified or the PhraudReport may become corrupt during
        transit. In areas where transmission security or secrecy is
        questionable, the application of a digital signature and/or message
        encryption on each report will counteract both of these concerns. We
        expect that each exchanging organization will determine the need, and
        mechanism, for transport protection..</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Using the iodef:restriction attribute">
        <t>In some instances data values in particular elements may contain
        data deemed sensitive by the reporter. Although there are no
        general-purpose rules on when to mark certain values as "private" or
        "need-to-know" via the iodef:restriction attribute, the reporter is
        cautioned to not apply element-level sensitivity markings unless they
        believe the receiving party (i.e., the party they are exchanging the
        event report data with) has a mechanism to adequately safeguard and
        process the data as marked. For example, if the PhraudReport element
        is marked private and contains a phishing collector URL in the
        DCSite/SiteURL element, can that URL be included within a block list
        distributed to other parties? No guidance is provided here except to
        urge exchanging parties to review the IODEF and PhraudReport documents
        to decide on common marking rules.</t>

Bridge Out: Benchmarking Methodology Extensions for Data Center Bridging
                                Devices

Abstract

   Existing benchmarking methodologies are based on the assumption that
   networking devices will impartially drop network traffic at their
   performance limits.  Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices, however,
   will attempt to throttle prioritized traffic from network endpoints
   before those limits are reached in order to minimize the probability
   of frame loss for high value traffic.  Hence, existing methodologies
   based around indiscriminate frame loss are inappropriate for DCB
   devices.  This document takes the basic benchmarking ideas based on
   loss and extends them to support "lossless" Ethernet devices.

Internet-Draft              DCB Benchmarking                 August 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document is intended to provide a methodology for benchmarking
   Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices that support Priority-based Flow
   Control (PFC).  It extends the methodologies already defined in
   [RFC2544] and [RFC2889].

   This memo primarily deals with devices which use Priority-based Flow
   Control, as defined in IEEE specification 802.1Qbb, to actively
   manage the transmission rate of multiple classes of traffic in order
   to minimize forwarding delay and frame loss for high priority
   traffic.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   As the terminology used by [RFC4689] is specific to IP layer testing,
   a number of existing terms require clarification when used in the DCB
   benchmarking context.  Additionally, a number of new terms are also
   presented to clarify concepts not clearly defined within the scope of
   [RFC4689].

      Classification: As stated in [RFC4689], Classification is the
      selection of packets according to defined rules.  In the context
      of DCB benchmarking, the Classification criterion is the value of
      the 802.1p priority code point field in the 802.1Q VLAN header of
      an Ethernet frame.

      Classification Group: A collection of traffic streams that belong
      to a single Classification.  A Conformance Vector MAY be
      associated with a Classification Group.

      Classification Profile: The set of all Classification Groups
      involved in a benchmarking test.

      Conformance Vector: A set of measurable stream result bounds, e.g.
      latency, jitter, sequencing, etc., that specify whether a frame is
      Conformant or Non-conformant.  Conformance vectors are optional
      for all DCB benchmarking tests.

      Congestion Management: In the context of DCB benchmarking,
      Congestion Management occurs when the DUT/SUT transmits Priority-
      based Flow Control (PFC) Pause frames.

      Forwarding Congestion: In the context of DCB benchmarking,
      Forwarding Congestion is extended to include the observation of
      PFC pause frame transmissions from the DUT.

      Intended Load: In this document, the Intended Load refers to the
      summation of the Intended Vectors for all Classification Groups.

      Offered Load: In this document, the Offered Load refers to the
      summation of the Offered Vectors for all Classification Groups.

      Queue Congestion: Queue congestion occurs when a DUT/SUT uses
      Congestion Management on a set of traffic Classifications.  The
      congestion Classifications correspond to the congested queues in
      the DUT/SUT.

      Queueput: The maximum Offered Load than can be transmitted into a
      DUT/SUT such that every transmitted frame matches a specific
      Classification rule, the DUT/SUT does NOT use priority-based flow
      control mechanisms to manage the ingress traffic rate of the
      Classification(s) of interest, and all ingress frames are
      forwarded to the correct egress port.  A DUT may have a different
      Queueput value for each configured Classification.

      XOFF Frame: A Priority-based flow control pause frame that
      instructs the DUT to pause one or more VLAN priorities.

      XON Frame: A Priority-based flow control pause frame that
      instructs the DUT to resume transmission on one or more VLAN
      priorities.


4.  General Considerations

4.1.  Classifications

   Data Center Bridging devices SHOULD be tested with multiple
   Classifications.  Testing with a single Classification provides no
   means to test and measure a device's ability to differentiate
   forwarding behavior for different traffic classes.

4.2.  Congestion

   For devices capable of forwarding traffic at line rate, explicit
   congestion MUST be created via the test tool in order to benchmark

   queue performance.  Possible methods for accomplishing this on a DUT
   with n ports include, but are not limited to:

   1.  Test full-mesh traffic patterns on (n-1) ports while using 1 port
       as a multicast transmitter with (n-1) multicast receivers.

   2.  Test full-mesh traffic patterns on (n-1) ports while generating
       partially meshed traffic between 1 and (n-1) ports.

   3.  Use partially meshed traffic patterns with x ports transmitting
       to y ports where x > y and x + y = n.

4.3.  Test Traffic

   The lock-step traffic pattern, as described in section 5.1.3 of
   [RFC2889], is specifically NOT required for DCB testing for two
   reasons:

   1.  Such patterns are not meaningful for high speed Ethernet devices
       due to the transmission clock variance allowed by the IEEE 802.3
       Ethernet specification.

   2.  Flow control mechanisms would quickly break such patterns when
       activated.

4.4.  Tester Capabilities

4.4.1.  Frame Formats

   This testing document does not mandate the use of any particular
   frame format for testing.  Any frame that can be legally forwarded by
   the DUT/SUT MAY be used provided that the test instrument can make
   the following distinctions for each frame:

   1.  The test tool MUST be able to distinguish test frames from non-
       test frames.

   2.  The test tool MUST be able to determine whether each test frame
       is forwarded to the correct egress port.

   3.  The test tool MUST be able to determine whether each received
       frame conforms or does not conform to the Conformance Vector of
       the frame's Classification Group, if applicable.

4.4.2.  Pause Response Time

   In order to accurately measure the performance of a Priority-based
   Flow Control capable DUT, the test tool MUST be able to respond to
   PFC pause frames.  Additionally, the test tool MUST respond to all
   received pause frames in the time period specified in the IEEE
   802.1Qbb specification.


5.  Test Setup

   This document extends the general test setup described in section 3
   of [RFC2889] and section 6 of [RFC2544] to the benchmarking of Data
   Center Ethernet switching devices.  [RFC2889] and [RFC2544] describe
   benchmarking methodologies for networking devices that intentionally
   drop frames at their performance limits.  In DCB networks, the DUT
   will transmit PFC Pause frames as a Congestion Management method to
   throttle network endpoints, thus minimizing the probability of frame
   loss in the network.

5.1.  Test Traffic

5.1.1.  Traffic Classification

   Since DCB devices are expected to support multiple traffic
   Classifications, it is RECOMMENDED to benchmark DCB devices with
   multiple Classification Groups.

5.1.2.  Trial Duration

   The RECOMMENDED trial duration is 300 seconds.  However other
   durations MAY be used.  Additionally, a running trial MAY be aborted
   once the test tool determines that the currently running trial has
   failed, e.g.  QoS bounds exceeded, packet loss detected on a lossless
   queue, etc.

5.1.3.  Frame Measurements

   Packet Conformance MUST be determined for all test frames on a per
   frame basis.  The method specified for measuring Latency in
   [RFC2544], e.g. measuring the latency of a single test frame in a
   traffic flow, is unsuitable for DCB benchmarking.

5.1.3.1.  Forwarding Delay and Latency

   Multiple methods exist for measuring the time it takes a test frame
   to be forwarded by a DUT.  However, both of the methods discussed in
   [RFC1242] are unsuitable for testing DCB devices, as many DCB devices

   alternate between both "store and forward" and "bit forwarding"
   behavior depending upon their queue congestion.  Hence, the only
   RECOMMENDED method for measuring the time it takes a DUT to forward a
   test frame is "Forwarding Delay" as described in [RFC4689].

5.1.4.  Frame Sizes

5.1.4.1.  Ethernet

   The recommended frame sizes for Ethernet testing are 64, 128, 256,
   512, 1024, 1280, 1518, 4096, 8192, and 9216 as per [RFC5180].  Note
   that these frame sizes include the Ethernet CRC and VLAN header.

5.1.4.1.1.  Fiber Channel over Ethernet

   FCoE test traffic introduces a number of frame size constraints that
   make the default frame sizes specified in [RFC5180] unusable:

   1.  FCoE frames contain an encapsulated Fiber Channel frame.  Due to
       the method of encapsulation used, all FCoE frames MUST be a
       multiple of 4 bytes.  See [RFC3643].

   2.  Test tools may need to include a test payload in addition to the
       encapsulated Fiber Channel frame in order to meet the
       requirements specified in Section 4.4.1.

   3.  The maximum supported frame size for FCoE is 2176 bytes.

   Due to these constraints, the recommended frame sizes for FCoE
   testing are 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, 1520, 2176, and the smallest
   FCoE frame size supported by the test tool.  Note that these frame
   sizes include both the Ethernet CRC and VLAN header.

5.1.5.  Burst Sizes

   As per [RFC2285], the burst size specifies the number of test frames
   in a burst.  To simulate bursty traffic, the test tool MAY send a
   burst of test traffic with the minimum, legal Inter-Frame Gap (IFG)
   between frames in the burst followed by a larger Inter-Burst Gap
   (IBG) between sequential bursts.  Note that burst sizes are only
   applicable to test traffic when the Offered Load of the test ports is
   less than the Maximum Offered Load (MOL) of those ports.
   Additionally, a burst size of 1 specifies a constant load, e.g. non-
   bursty traffic.

6.  Benchmarking Tests

6.1.  Pause Response Time

6.1.1.  Objective

   To determine the amount of time required for the DUT to respond to
   priority-based flow control pause frames.

6.1.2.  Setup Parameters

   The following parameters MUST be defined.  Each variable is
   configured with the following considerations.

      Each Classification Group MUST be listed.  For each classification
      group, the following parameters MUST be specified:

         Codepoint - For DCB tests, the codepoint is the VLAN priority.

         Frame Size - The frame size includes both the CRC and VLAN
         header.  See Section 5.1.4 for recommended frame sizes.

         Burst Size - The burst size specifies the number of frames
         transmitted with the minimum legal IFG before pausing.  See
         Section 5.1.5.

         Intended Vector - The intended vector SHOULD specify the
         intended rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port
         load.

         Traffic Pattern - The traffic distribution and traffic
         orientation used for this Classification.

         Conformance Vector - The conformance vector is optional, but
         MUST be defined if used.

      Priority-based Flow Control - PFC mechanisms MUST be enabled.

      Background Traffic - Background traffic MAY be present.

      PFC Pause Parameters:

         Queue(s) - A list of one or more VLAN priorities the test tool
         should attempt to pause.

         Pause Value - The quanta value to use in the XOFF frame(s).

         XON Delay - The amount of time to pause the DUT before sending
         a XON frame.  Note that if the XON Delay is larger than the
         Pause Value, the test tool MUST send multiple XOFF frames to
         ensure that the DUT remains paused until the XON frame is
         transmitted.

6.1.3.  Procedure

   The test tool SHOULD generate test traffic for at least 30 seconds
   before sending any XOFF frame in order for the DUT to reach a steady-
   state forwarding condition.  The test tool then transmits one or more
   XOFF frames on one or more ports.  Each XOFF frame SHOULD instruct
   the DUT to pause one or more of the Classification Groups currently
   being forwarded by the DUT.  The test tool MAY optionally send a XON
   frame to instruct the DUT to resume transmission.

6.1.4.  Measurements

   The following measurements MUST be reported for each test port and
   codepoint involved in the test.

      Offered Load - the Offered Load from the DUT in N-octet frames per
      second or bits per second.  Note: The Offered Load from the DUT
      may be insufficient to accurately measure the DUT's Pause Response
      Time.  This condition SHOULD be noted in the results.

      The total number of PFC frames transmitted to the DUT by the test
      tool.

      The following values SHOULD be reported in either quanta OR
      seconds:

         Pause Response Time - The time between the transmit time of the
         last bit of the pause frame and the receive time of the first
         bit of the last codepoint matching test frame forwarded by the
         DUT before the DUT is observed to pause the intended queue.

         Intended Pause Time - The total time the test tool instructed
         the DUT to pause.

         Observed Pause Time - The actual time the DUT was observed to
         pause.

         XON Response Time - The time between the transmit time of the
         last bit of the XON frame and the receive time of the first bit
         of the first unpaused test packet from the DUT.

         intended rate of test traffic specified as a percentage of port
         load.

         Traffic Pattern - The traffic distribution and traffic
         orientation used for this Classification.

   Conformance Vector is specified for the test and Non-conformant
   frames are received during a trial, then the Intended Vector SHOULD
   be reduced for the subsequent trial.  The algorithm MUST adjust the
   Intended Vector for each Classification Group.  The search algorithms
   for each Classification Group MAY be run in parallel.  The test
   continues until all Classification Groups in the test have converged
   on a discrete Queueput value.

   MUST be reported.  Any frame loss observed for test traffic using
   non-PFC enabled codepoints on uncongested egress ports SHOULD be
   reported, as that indicates the DUT is performing Head of Line
   Blocking (HOLB).

6.4.3.  Procedure

   The initial trial SHOULD begin with an Intended Load equal to or
   greater than the Maximum Forwarding Rate of the DUT/SUT.  For each
   subsequent trial, the aggregate load is reduced until the DUT is

7.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.


8.  IANA Consdierations

   Testers SHOULD use network addresses assigned by IANA for the purpose
   of testing networks.

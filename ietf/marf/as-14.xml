		<t> RFC 5965 defines an extensible, machine-readable
	    format intended for mail operators to report
		    feedback about received email to other parties.
		    This Applicability Statement describes common
		    methods for utilizing this format for reporting
		    both abuse and authentication failure events.
		    Mailbox Providers of any size, mail sending
		    entities, and end users can use these methods as
		    a basis to create procedures that best suit
		    them.  Some related optional mechanisms are
		    also discussed. </t>

	<section title="Introduction">
		<t> The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) was initially
		    developed for two very specific use cases.
		    Initially, it was intended to be used for
		    reporting feedback between large email operators,
		    or from large email operators to end user network
		    access operators, any of whom could be presumed to
		    have automated abuse-handling systems.
		    Secondarily, it is used by those same large mail
	    operators to send those same reports to other
		    entities, including those involved in sending bulk
		    email for commercial purposes.  In either case,
		    the reports would be triggered by direct end user 
		    action such as clicking on a "report spam" button
		    in their email client. </t>
			
		<t> Though other uses for the ARF format defined in
		    <xref target="RFC5965"/> have been discussed (and
		    may be documented similarly in the future), abuse
		    remains the primary application, with a small
		    amount of adoption of extensions that enable
		    authentication failure reporting. </t>

		<t> This Applicability Statement provides direction
		    for using the Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) in
		    both contexts.  It also includes some statements
		    about the use of ARF in conjunction with other email
		    technologies. </t>
			
		<t> The purpose for reporting abusive messages is to
		    stop recurrences.  The methods described in this
		    document focus on automating abuse reporting as
	    much as practical, so as to minimize the work of
		    a site's abuse team.  There are further reasons why
		    abuse feedback generation is worthwhile, such as 
		    instruction of mail filters or reputation trackers,
		    or to initiate investigations of particularly
		    egregious abuses.  These other applications are
		    not discussed in this memo. </t>

		<t> Further introduction to this topic may be found
		    in <xref target="RFC6449"/>. </t>

<section title="Definitions">
		<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
		    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
		    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
		    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are

		<t> Some of the terminology used in this
		    document is taken from
		    <xref target="RFC5598"/>. </t>
						
		<t> "Mailbox Provider" refers to an
		    organization that accepts, stores, and
		    offers access to <xref target="RFC5322"/>
		    messages ("email messages") for end users.
		    Such an organization has typically
		    implemented SMTP
		    (<xref target="RFC5321"/>), and might
		    provide access to messages through IMAP
	    (<xref target="RFC3501"/>), POP
		    (<xref target="RFC1939"/>), a proprietary
		    interface designed for HTTP
		    (<xref target="RFC2616"/>), or a
		    proprietary protocol. </t>
	</section>
		
	<section title="Solicited and Unsolicited Reports">
	   <t>The original application of <xref target="RFC5965"/>,
	      and still by far the most common, is when two mail
	      systems make a private agreement to exchange abuse
	      reports, usually reports due to recipients manually
	      reporting messages as spam.  We refer to these as
	      solicited reports.</t>

	   <t>Other uses for ARF involve such reports sent between parties
	      that don't know each other.  These unsolicited reports
	      are sent without prior arrangement between the parties
	      as to the context and meaning of the reports, so the
	      constraints on how these unsolicited reports need to be
	      structured such that the reports generated are likely to
	      be useful to the recipient, to what address(es) they
	      can usefully be sent, what issues the can be used to
	      report, and how they can be handled by the receiver
	      of the report are very different. </t>

	   <t>The two cases are covered separately in following sections. </t>

			<t> It is essential for report recipients to be capable

			<t> Message authentication is generally a good

			    and/or DomainKeys Identified Mail

	<section anchor="unsol_when"
			 title="When To Generate Reports">
		    <t> <list style="numbers">
			<t> Handling of unsolicited reports has a
			    significant cost to the receiver.  Senders
			    of unsolicited reports, especially those
			    sending large volumes of them
			    automatically SHOULD NOT send reports that cannot
			    be used as a basis for action by the recipient,
			    whether this is due to the report being sent about
			    an incident that is not abuse-related, the
			    report being sent to an email address that
			    won't result in action, or the content or
			    format of the report being hard for the
			    recipient to read or use. </t>

			<t> Feedback Providers SHOULD NOT report all mail sent
			    from a particular sender merely because
			    some of it is determined to be abusive. </t>

			<t> Mechanical reports of mail that "looks
			    like" spam, based solely on the results
			    of inline content analysis tools, SHOULD
			    NOT be sent since, because of their
			    subjective nature, they are unlikely to
			    provide a basis for the recipient to take
			    action.  Complaints generated by end users about
			    mail that is determined by them to be abusive,
			    or mail delivered to "spam trap" or "honeypot"
			    addresses, are far more likely to be accurate and
			    MAY be sent. </t>

			<t> If a Feedback Provider applies SPF to
			    arriving messages, a report SHOULD NOT be
			    generated to the RFC5321.MailFrom domain
			    if the SPF evaluation produced a "Fail",
			    "SoftFail", "TempError" or "PermError"
			    report, as no reliable assertion or assumption
			    can be made that use of the domain was
			    authorized.  A valid exception would be specific
			    knowledge that the SPF result is not
			    definitive for that domain under those
			    circumstances (for example, a message that
			    is also DKIM-signed by the same domain,
			    and that signature validates). </t>
		    </list> </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="unsol_where"
		         title="Where To Send Reports">
		    <t> <list style="numbers">
			<t> Rather than generating feedback reports themselves,
			    MUAs SHOULD make abuse reports back to their
			    mailbox providers so that they can generate and
			    send ARF messages on behalf of end users (see
			    Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC6449"/>).  This
			    allows centralized processing and tracking of
			    reports, and provides training input to filtering
			    systems.  There is, however, no standard mechanism
			    for this signaling between MUAs and mailbox
			    providers to trigger abuse reports. </t>

			<t> Feedback Providers SHOULD NOT send reports to
			    recipients that are uninvolved or only
			    peripherally involved.  For example, they
			    SHOULD NOT send reports to the operator
			    of every Autonomous System in the path
			    between the apparent originating system
			    and the operator generating the
			    report.  Instead, they need to send reports to
			    recipients that are both responsible for
			    the messages and are able to do something
			    about them.  </t>

			<t> Deciding where to send an unsolicited
			    report will typically rely on heuristics.
			    Abuse addresses in WHOIS (<xref target="RFC3912"/>)
			    records of the IP address relaying the subject
			    message and/or of the domain name found in the
			    results of a PTR ("reverse lookup") query
			    on that address are likely reasonable
			    candidates, as is the abuse@domain role
			    address (see <xref target="RFC2142"/>) of
			    related domains.  Unsolicited reports
			    SHOULD NOT be sent to email addresses that
			    are not clearly intended to handle abuse reports.
			    Legitimate candidates include those found in
			    WHOIS records or on a web site that either
			    are explicitly described as an abuse contact, or
			    are of the form "abuse@domain". </t>

	        	<t> Where an abusive message is authenticated using a
			    domain-level authentication technology
			    such as DKIM (<xref target="RFC6376"/>)
			    or SPF (<xref target="RFC4408"/>), the
			    domain that has been verified by the
			    authentication mechanism is often a
			    reasonable candidate for receiving
			    feedback about the message.  For DKIM,
			    though, while the authenticated domain
			    has some responsibility for the mail sent,
			    it can be a poor contact point for abuse
			    issues (for example, it could represent
			    the message's author but not its sender,
			    it could identify the bad actor
			    responsible for the message, or it could
			    refer to a domain that cannot receive mail
			    at all). </t>

			<t> Often, unsolicited reports will have no meaning
			    if sent to abuse reporting addresses belonging to
			    the abusive parties themselves.  In fact, it is
			    possible that such reports might reveal information
			    about complainants.  Reports SHOULD NOT be
			    sent to such addresses if they can be identified
			    beforehand, except where the abusive party
			    is known to be responsive to such reports. </t>

		<section anchor="unsol_what"
		         title="What To Put In Reports">
		    <t> <list style="numbers">
			<t> Reports SHOULD use "Feedback-Type: abuse",
			    but can use other types as appropriate.
			    However, the Mailbox Provider generating
			    the reports cannot assume that the
			    operator receiving the reports will treat
			    different Feedback-Types differently. </t>

			<t> Reports SHOULD include the following
			    optional fields whenever their corresponding
			    values are available and applicable to the report:
			    Original-Mail-From, Arrival-Date,
			    Source-IP, Original-Rcpt-To.  Other
			    optional fields can be included, as the
			    implementer feels is appropriate. </t>
				
			<t> Experience suggests use of ARF is
			    advisable in most contexts.  Automated
			    recipient systems can handle abuse reports
			    sent in ARF format at least as well as any
			    other format such as plain text, with or
			    without a copy of the message attached.
			    That holds even for systems that did not
			    request ARF format reports, assuming such
			    reports are generated considering the possibility
			    of recipients that don't use automated ARF
			    parsing.  Anyone sending unsolicited
			    reports in ARF format can legitimately
			    presume that some recipients will only be
			    able to access the human readable (first,
			    text/plain) part of it, and SHOULD include
			    all information needed also in this part.
			    Further, they SHOULD ensure that the
			    report is readable when viewed as plain
			    text, to give low-end ticketing systems as
			    much assistance as possible.  In extreme
			    cases, failure to take these steps may result
			    in the report being discarded or ignored. </t>

			<t> Receivers of unsolicited reports
			    can take advantage of the
			    standardized parts of the ARF format to
			    automate processing.  Independent of the
			    sender of the report, they can improve
			    processing by separating valid from invalid reports
			    by, for example, looking for references
			    to IP address ranges, domains, and
			    mailboxes for which the recipient
			    organization is responsible in the copy of
			    the reported message, and by correlating
			    multiple reports of similar messages to
			    identify bulk senders.  </t>

			<t> Per Section 4.4 of
			    <xref target="RFC6449"/>, a network
			    service provider MAY use ARF data for
			    automated forwarding of feedback messages
			    to the originating customer. </t> 

			<t> Published abuse mailbox addresses SHOULD
			    NOT reject non-ARF messages based solely on
			    the format, as generation of ARF messages can
			    occasionally be unavailable or not
			    applicable.  Deviation from this requirement
			    could be done due to local policy decisions
			    regarding other message criteria. </t>

			<t> Although <xref target="RFC6449"/> suggests
			    that replying to feedback is not useful,
			    in the case of receipt of ARF reports
			    where no feedback arrangement has been
			    established, a non-automated reply might be
			    desirable to indicate what action resulted
			    from the complaint, heading off more severe
			    filtering by the Feedback Provider.  In
			    addition, using an address that cannot
			    receive replies precludes any requests for
			    additional information, and increases the
			    likelihood that further reports will be
			    discarded or blocked.  Thus, a Feedback
			    Provider sending unsolicited reports
			    SHOULD NOT generate reports for which a reply
			    cannot be received.  Where an
			    unsolicited report results in the
			    establishment of contact with a
			    responsible and responsive party, this can
			    be saved for future complaint handling and
			    possible establishment of a formal
			    (solicited) feedback arrangement.  See
			    Section 3.5 of <xref target="RFC6449"/>

		    and <xref target="I-D.IETF-MARF-SPF-REPORTING"/>.
		    The considerations presented below apply in those
		    cases. </t>

		<t> The applicability statement for this use case
		    is somewhat smaller as many of the issues
		    associated with abuse reports are not relevant
		    to reports about authentication failures. </t>

		<t> <list style="numbers">
			<t> Automatic feedback generators MUST select
			    recipients based on data provided by the report
			    recipient.  In particular, recipients MUST NOT be
			    selected using heuristics. </t>

			<t> If the message under evaluation by the
			    Verifier is an ARF
			    (<xref target="RFC5965"/>)
			    message, a report MUST NOT be automatically
			    generated. </t>

			<t> The message for a new report sent via SMTP MUST
			    be constructed so as to avoid amplification
			    attacks, deliberate or otherwise.  The envelope
			    sender address of the report MUST be chosen so
			    that these reports will not generate mail loops.
			    Similar to Section 2 of <xref target="RFC3464"/>,
			    the envelope sender address of the report MUST be
			    chosen to ensure that no feedback reports will
			    be issued in response to the report itself.
			    Therefore, when an SMTP transaction is used to send
			    a report, the MAIL FROM command SHOULD use the
			    NULL reverse-path, i.e., "MAIL FROM:<>".  An
			    exception to this would be the use of a
			    reverse-path selected such that SPF checks on
			    the report will pass; in such cases, the operator
			    will need to make provisions to avoid the
			    amplification attack or mail loop via other
			    means. </t>

			<t> Reports SHOULD use
			    "Feedback-Type: auth-failure", but MAY use
			    other types as appropriate.  However, the
			    Mailbox Provider generating the reports
			    cannot assume that the operator
			    receiving the reports will treat different
			    Feedback-Types differently. </t>

			<t> These reports SHOULD include the following
			    optional fields, although they are optional
			    in <xref target="RFC5965"/>, whenever their
			    corresponding values are available:
			    Original-Mail-From, Arrival-Date,
			    Source-IP, Original-Rcpt-To.  Other
			    optional fields can be included, as the
			    implementer feels is appropriate. </t>

			<t> Feedback Providers that relay user
			    complaints directly, rather than by
			    reference to a stored message (e.g.,
			    IMAP or POP), could be duped into sending
			    a complaint about a message that the
			    complaining user never actually received,
			    as an attack on the purported originator
			    of the falsified message.  Feedback
			    Providers need to be resilient to such
			    attack methods. </t>

			<t> Also, these reports may be forged as
			    easily as ordinary Internet electronic
			    mail.  User agents and automatic mail
			    handling facilities (such as mail
			    distribution list exploders) that wish
			    to make automatic use of reports of any
			    kind should take appropriate precautions
			    to minimize the potential damage from
			    denial-of-service attacks. </t>

			<t> Perhaps the simplest means of mitigating
			    this threat is to assert that these
			    reports should themselves be signed with
			    something like DKIM or authorized by SPF.
			    On the other hand,
			    if there is a problem with the DKIM
			    infrastructure at the Verifier, signing
			    DKIM failure reports may produce reports
			    that aren't trusted or even accepted by
			    their intended recipients.  Similar issues
			    could exist with SPF evaluation.  Use of
			    both technologies can mitigate this risk
			    to a degree. </t>

		<section anchor="sec-autogen"
		         title="Automatic Generation">
			<t> ARF (<xref target="RFC5965"/>) reports have
			    historically been generated individually
			    as a result of some kind of human request,
			    such as someone clicking a "Report Abuse"
			    button in a mail reader.  In contrast, the
			    mechanisms described in some extension
			    documents (i.e.,
			    <xref target="I-D.IETF-MARF-DKIM-REPORTING"/>
			    and
			    <xref target="I-D.IETF-MARF-SPF-REPORTING"/>)
			    are focused around automated reporting.
			    This obviously implies the potential for
			    much larger volumes or frequency of
			    messages, and thus greater mail system
			    load (both for Feedback Providers and
			    report receivers). </t>

			<t> Those mechanisms are primarily intended
			    for use in generating reports to aid
			    implementers of DKIM
			    (<xref target="RFC6376"/>),
			    ADSP (<xref target="RFC5617"/>), and
			    SPF (<xref target="RFC4408"/>), and other
			    related
			    protocols during development and debugging.
			    They are not generally intended for
			    prolonged forensic use, specifically
			    because of these load concerns.  However,
			    extended use is possible by ADMDs that
			    want to keep a close watch for fraud or
			    infrastructure problems.  It is important
			    to consider the impact of doing so on both
			    Feedback Providers and the requesting
			    ADMDs. </t>

			<t> A sender requesting these reports can
			    cause its mail servers to be overwhelmed
			    if it sends out signed messages whose
			    signatures fail to verify for some reason,
			    provoking a large number of reports from
			    Feedback Providers.  Similarly, a Feedback
			    Provider could be overwhelmed by a large
			    volume of messages requesting reports
			    whose signatures fail to validate, as
			    those now need to send reports back to
			    the signer. </t>

			<t> Limiting the rate of generation of these
			    messages may be appropriate but threatens
			    to inhibit the distribution of important
			    and possibly time-sensitive
			    information. </t>

			<t> In general ARF feedback loop terms, it is
			    often suggested that Feedback Providers
			    only create these (or any) ARF reports
			    after an out-of-band arrangement has been
			    made between two parties.  These extension
			    mechanisms then become ways to adjust
			    parameters of an authorized abuse report
			    feedback loop that is configured and
			    activated by private agreement rather than
			    starting to send them automatically based
			    solely on data found in the messages,
			    which may have unintended
			    consequences. </t>

		<section anchor="multiple-incidents"
		         title="Reporting Multiple Incidents">
			<t> If it is known that a particular host
			    generates abuse reports upon certain
			    incidents, an attacker could forge a high
			    volume of messages that will trigger such
			    a report.  The recipient of the report
			    could then be innundated with reports. 
			    This could easily be extended to a
			    distributed denial-of-service attack by
			    finding a number of report-generating
			    servers. </t>

			<t> The incident count referenced in
			    ARF (<xref target="RFC5965"/>) provides a
			    limited
			    form of mitigation.  The host generating
			    reports can elect to send reports only
			    periodically, with each report
			    representing a number of identical or
			    nearly-identical incidents.  One might
			    even do something inverse-exponentially,
			    sending reports for each of the first ten
			    incidents, then every tenth incident up
			    to 100, then every 100th incident up to
			    1000, etc., until some period of relative
			    quiet after which the limitation
			    resets. </t>

			<t> The use of this for "nearly-identical"
			    incidents in particular causes a
			    degradation in reporting quality, however.
			    If for example a large number of pieces of
			    spam arrive from one attacker, a reporting
			    agent could decide only to send a report
			    about a fraction of those messages.  While
			    this averts a flood of reports to a
			    system administrator, the precise details
			    of each incident are similarly not
			    sent. </t>

			<t> Other rate limiting provisions might be
			    considered, including detection of a
			    temporary failure response from the report
			    destination and thus halting report
			    generation to that destination for some
			    period, or simply imposing or negotiating
			    a hard limit on the number of reports to
			    be sent to a particular receiver in a
			    given time frame. </t>

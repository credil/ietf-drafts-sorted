	  <t>This document defines a reliable transport mechanism for the
          PIM protocol for transmission of Join/Prune messages. This
          eliminates the need for periodic Join/Prune message transmission
          and processing. The reliable transport mechanism can use either
          TCP or SCTP as the transport protocol.</t>

	<section title="Introduction">
	    <t>The goals of this specification are:</t>
	    <t><list style="symbols">
	      <t>To create a simple incremental mechanism to provide reliable
	      PIM Join/Prune message delivery in PIM version 2 for use with PIM
	      Sparse-Mode <xref target="RFC4601"/> (including Source-Specific
	      Multicast) and Bidirectional PIM
	      <xref target="RFC5015"/>.</t>
	      <t>When a router supports this specification, it need not
	      use the reliable transport mechanism with every neighbor.
	      It can be negotiated on a per neighbor basis.</t>
	    </list></t>

	    <t>The explicit non-goals of this specification are:</t>
	    <t><list style="symbols">
	      <t>Changes to the PIM message formats as defined in 
		<xref target="RFC4601"/>.</t>
	      <t>Provide support for automatic switching between the reliable
		transport mechanism and the regular PIM mechanism defined in
		<xref target="RFC4601"/>.
		Two routers that are PIM neighbors on a link will always use
		the reliable transport mechanism if and only if both have
		enabled support for the reliable transport mechanism.</t>
	    </list></t>

	    <t>This document will specify how periodic Join/Prune message
	    transmission can be eliminated by using TCP 
	    <xref target="RFC0793"/> or SCTP <xref target="RFC4960"/> as the 
	    reliable transport mechanism for Join/Prune messages. The
	    destination port number is 8471 for both TCP and SCTP.</t>

	    <t>This specification enables greater scalability in terms
	      of control traffic overhead. However, for routers connected
	      to multi-access links that comes at the price of increased
	      PIM state and the overhead required to maintain this state.</t>

            <t>In many existing and emerging networks, particularly
            wireless and mobile satellite systems, link degradation due
            to weather, interference, and other impairments can result
            in temporary spikes in the packet loss. In these
            environments, periodic PIM joining can cause join latency
            when messages are lost causing a retransmission only 60
            seconds later. By applying a reliable transport, a lost join
            is retransmitted rapidly. Furthermore, when the last user
            leaves a multicast group, any lost prune is similarly
            repaired and the multicast stream is quickly removed from
            the wireless/satellite link. Without a reliable transport,
            the multicast transmission could otherwise continue until it
            timed out, roughly 3 minutes later.  As network resources
            are at a premium in many of these environments, rapid
            termination of the multicast stream is critical for
            maintaining efficient use of bandwidth.</t>

	    <t>This is an experimental extension to PIM. It makes some
            fundamental changes to how PIM works in that Join/Prune
            state does not require periodic updates, and partly turns
            PIM into a hard-state protocol. Also, using reliable
            delivery for PIM messages is a new concept, and it is
            likely that experiences from early implementations and
            deployments will lead to at least minor changes in the
            protocol. It should be considered making this a standards
            track protocol once there is some deployment experience.
            Experiments using this protocol only require support by
            pairs of PIM neighbors, and need not be constrained to
            isolated networks.</t>

	<section title="Protocol Overview">
  	  <t>PIM Over Reliable Transport (PORT) is a simple extension to
	  PIMv2 for refresh reduction of PIM Join/Prune messages. It involves
	  sending incremental rather than periodic Join/Prune messages over
	  a TCP/SCTP connection between PIM neighbors.</t>

	  <t>PORT only applies to PIM Sparse-Mode <xref target="RFC4601"/>
            and Bidirectional PIM <xref target="RFC5015"/> Join/Prune
	    messages.</t>

	  <t>This document does not restrict PORT to any specific link types.
	    However, the use of PORT on e.g. multi-access LANs with many PIM
	    neighbors should be carefully evaluated. This due to the fact that
	    there may be a full mesh of PORT connections, and that explicit
	    tracking of all PIM PORT routers is required.</t>

	  <t>PORT can be incrementally used on a link between PORT-capable
	  neighbors. Routers that are not PORT-capable can continue
	  to use PIM in Datagram Mode. PORT capability is detected using
	  new PORT-Capable PIM Hello Options.</t>

	  <t>Once PORT is enabled on an interface and a PIM neighbor also
	  announces that it is PORT enabled, only PORT Join/Prune messages
	  will be used. That is, only PORT Join/Prune messages are
	  accepted from, and sent to, that particular neighbor. Native
	  Join/Prune messages are still used for PIM neighbors that are
	  not PORT enabled.</t>

	  <t>PORT Join/Prune messages are sent using a TCP/SCTP connection.
	  When two PIM neighbors are PORT enabled, both for TCP or both
	  for SCTP, they will immediately, or on-demand, establish a
	  connection. If the connection goes down, they will again
	  immediately, or on-demand, try to reestablish the connection.
	  No Join/Prune messages (neither Native nor PORT) are sent while
	  there is no connection. Also, any received native Join/Prune
	  messages from that neighbor are discarded, even when the
	  connection is down.</t>

          <t>When PORT is used, only incremental Join/Prune messages are sent
	  from downstream
          routers to upstream routers. As such, downstream routers do not
          generate periodic Join/Prune messages for state for which the RPF
	  neighbor is PORT-capable.</t>

          <t>For Joins and Prunes, which are received over a TCP/SCTP 
	  connection, 
	  the upstream router does not start or maintain timers on the 
	  outgoing interface
          entry. Instead, it keeps track of which downstream routers have
          expressed interest. An interface is deleted from the outgoing
	  interface list
          only when all downstream routers on the interface, no longer wish to
          receive traffic. If there also are native joins/prunes from
	  non-PORT neighbor, then one can maintain timers on the outgoing
	  interface entry as usual, while at the same time keep track of
	  each of the downstream PORT joins/prunes.
	  </t>

          <t>This document does not update the PIM Join/Prune packet format.
	  In the procedures described in this document, each PIM Join/Prune
	  message
	  is included in the payload of a PORT message carried over TCP/SCTP. 
	  See section <xref target="PM"/> for details on the PORT message.</t>

	<section title="Establishing Transport Connections">
	  <t>While a router interface is PORT enabled, a PIM-over-TCP
	  or a PIM-over-SCTP option MUST be included in the PIM Hello messages
	  sent on that interface. When a router on a PORT-enabled
	  interface receives a Hello message containing a
	  PIM-over-TCP/PIM-over-SCTP Option from a new neighbor,
	  or an existing neighbor that did not previously include the
	  option, it switches to PORT mode for that particular neighbor.</t>

	  <t>When a router switches to PORT mode for a neighbor, it stops
	  sending and accepting Native Join/Prune messages for that neighbor.
	  Any state from previous Native Join/Prune messages is left to expire
	  as normal. It will also attempt to establish a Transport connection
	  (TCP or SCTP) with the neighbor. If both the router and its
	  neighbor have announced both PIM-over-TCP and PIM-over-SCTP
	  options, SCTP MUST be used. This resolves the issue where two
	  transports are both offered. The method prefers SCTP over TCP,
          because SCTP has benefits such as call collision handling and
	  support for multiple streams, as discussed later
          in this document.</t>

          <t>When the router is using TCP, it will compare
          the TCP Connection ID it announced in the PIM-over-TCP-Capable
          Option with the TCP Connection ID in the Hello received from the
          neighbor. Unless connections are opened on-demand (see below),
          the router with the lower Connection ID MUST do an
          active Transport open to the neighbor Connection ID. The router
          with the higher Connection ID MUST do a passive Transport open.
	  An implementation MAY open connections only on-demand, in that
          case it may be that the neighbor with the higher Connection ID
          does the active open, see <xref target="ondemand"/>. If the
          router with the lower Connection ID chooses to only do an
          active open on-demand, it MUST do a passive open, allowing for
          the neighbor to initiate the connection.
	  Note that the source address of the active open MUST be the
          announced Connection ID.</t>

          <t>When the router is using SCTP, the IP address comparison
	  need not be done since the SCTP protocol can handle
	  call collision.</t>

	  <t>The decisions whether to use PORT, which transport, and which
	  Connection IDs to use are performed independently for IPv4 and
	  IPv6. Thus, if PORT is used both for IPv4 and IPv6, both IPv4
	  and IPv6 PIM Hello messages MUST be sent, both containing PORT
	  Hello options. If two neighbors announce the same transport (TCP
	  or SCTP) and the same Connection IDs in the IPv4 and IPv6 Hello
	  messages, then only one connection is established and is shared.
	  Otherwise, two connections are established and are used separately.
	  </t>

	  <t>The PIM router that performs the active open initiates the 
          connection with a locally
          generated source transport port number and a well-known destination
          transport port number. The PIM router that performs the passive open
          listens on the well-known local transport port number and does not
          qualify the remote transport port number. See <xref target="PM" />
          for well-known port number assignment for PORT.</t>

	  <t>When a Transport connection is established (or reestablished),
	  the two routers MUST both send a full set of Join/Prune messages
	  for state for which the other router
	  is the upstream neighbor. This is needed to ensure that the
	  upstream neighbor has the correct state. When moving from
	  Datagram mode, or when the connection has gone down, the router
	  cannot be sure that all the previous Join/Prune state was received
	  by the neighbor. Any state created before the connection was
          established (or reestablished) that is not refreshed, MUST be
          left to expire and be deleted. When the non-refreshed state has
          expired and been deleted, the two neighbors will be in sync.</t>

	  <t>When not running PORT, a full update is only needed when a
	  router restarts, with PORT it must be done every time a connection
	  is established. This can be costly, although it is expected that
	  it is a rare event for a PORT connection to go up and down. There
	  may be a need for extensions to better handle this.</t>

	  <t>It is possible that a router starts sending Hello messages
	  with a new Connection ID, e.g. due to configuration changes.
          A router MUST always use the last announced and last seen Connection
	  IDs. A connection is identified by the local Connection ID (the
          one we are announcing on a particular interface), and the remote
          Connection ID (the one we are receiving from a neighbor on the
          same interface). When either the local or remote ID changes, the
          Connection ID pair we need a connection for changes. There may
          be an existing connection with the same pair, in which case the router
          will share that connection. Or a new connection may need to be
          established. Note that for link-local addresses, the interface
          should be regarded as part of the ID, so that connection sharing
          is not attempted when the same link-local addresses are seen on
          different interfaces.</t>
          <t>When a Connection ID changes, if the previously used connection
	  is not needed (there are no other PIM neighborships using the
          same Connection ID pair), both peers MUST attempt to reset the
	  transport connection. Next (even if the old connection is
          still needed), they MUST, unless a connection already exists with
	  the new Connection ID pair, immediately or on-demand attempt to
	  establish a new connection with the new Connection ID pair.
	  </t>
	  <t>Normally the Interface ID would not change while a connection
	  is up. However, if it does, it does not affect the connection.
	  It just means that when subsequent PORT join/prune messages are
	  received, they should be matched against the last seen Interface
          ID.</t>

          <t>Note that, a Join sent over a Transport connection will only be
	    seen by the upstream router, and thus will not cause  routers on
	    the link that do not use PIM PORT with the upstream router to
	    possibly delay the refresh of Join state for the same state.
	    Similarly, a Prune sent over a Transport connection will only be
	    seen by the upstream router, and will thus never cause routers on
	    the link that do not use PIM PORT with the upstream
	    router, to send a Join to override this Prune.</t>

	  <t>Note also, that a datagram PIM Join/Prune message for a said
	    (S,G) or (*,G) sent by some router on a link will not cause
	    routers on the same link that use a Transport connection with the
	    upstream router for that state, to suppress the refresh of that
	    state to the upstream router (because they don't need to
	    periodically refresh this state) or to send a Join to override a
	    Prune (as the upstream router will only stop forwarding the
	    traffic when all joined routers that use a Transport connection
	    have explicitly sent a Prune for this state, as explained in
	    <xref target="track"/>).</t>

	  <section title="Connection Security" anchor="consec">
	    <t>TCP/SCTP packets used for PORT MUST be sent with a TTL/Hop

            a different TTL/Hop Limit threshold to check that the sender
	    is within a certain number of router hops. The GTSM check
	    SHOULD be disabled by default.

	  <section title="Connection Maintenance" anchor="conman">
	    <t>TCP is designed to keep connections up indefinitely during
	    a period of network disconnection. If a PIM-over-TCP router fails,
	    the TCP connection may stay up until the neighbor 
	    actually reboots,  
	    and even then it may continue to stay up until PORT tries
	    to send the neighbor some information. This is particularly
	    relevant to PIM, since the flow of Join/Prune messages might be
	    in only one 
	    direction, and the downstream neighbor might never get any 
	    indication via TCP that the other end of the connection 
	    is not really there.</t>

	    <t>SCTP has a heart beat mechanism that can be used to detect
	    that a connection is not working, even when no data is sent. Many
	    TCP implementations also support sending keep-alives for this
	    purpose. Implementations MAY make use of TCP keep-alives, but
	    it the PORT keep-alive mechanism defined below allows for more
	    control and flexibility.</t>

	    <t>One can detect that a PORT connection is not
	    working by regularly sending PORT messages. This applies to both
            TCP and SCTP. E.g., for TCP the
	    connection will be reset if no TCP ACKs are received after several
            retries. PORT in itself does not require any periodic signaling.
            PORT Join/Prune
	    messages are only sent when there is a state change. If
	    the state changes are not frequent enough, a PORT Keep-Alive
	    message (defined in <xref target="KAmsg"/>) can be sent instead.
	    E.g., if an implementation wants
	    to send a PORT message, to check that the connection is working,
	    at least every 60 seconds, then whenever there is 60 seconds
	    since the previous message, a Keep-Alive message could be
	    sent. If there were less than 60 seconds between each
	    Join/Prune, no Keep-Alive messages would be needed.
	    Implementations SHOULD support the use of PORT Keep-Alive
	    messages. It is RECOMMENDED that a configuration option is
	    available to network administrators to enable it when needed.
            Note that Keep-Alives can be used by a peer, independently of
            whether the other peer supports it.</t>

	    <t>An implementation that supports Keep-Alive messages acts as
	    follows when processing a received PORT message.
	    When processing a Keep-Alive message with a non-zero Holdtime
	    value, it MUST set a timer to the value. We call
	    this timer Connection Expiry Timer (CET). If the CET is already
	    running, it MUST be reset to the new value. When processing
	    a Keep-Alive message with a zero Holdtime value, the CET MUST
	    be stopped if running.
	    When processing a PORT message other than Keep-Alive, the
	    CET MUST be reset to the last received Holdtime value if
	    running. If the CET is not running, no action is taken.
	    If the CET expires, the connection SHOULD be shut down.
	    This specification does not mandate a specific default Holdtime
            value. However, the dynamic congestion and flow control in TCP
            and SCTP can result in variable transit delay between the
            endpoints when capacity varies, there may be loss in the network
            or variable link performance. Consistent behaviour therefore
            requires a sufficiently large Holdtime value. E.g., 60 seconds
            to prevent premature termination.</t>

	    <t>It is possible that a router receives Join/Prune
	    messages for an interface/link that is down. As long as the
	    neighbor has not expired, it is RECOMMENDED processing those
	    messages as usual. If they are ignored, then the router SHOULD
	    ensure it gets a full update for that interface when it
	    comes back up. This can be done by changing the GenID
            (Generation Identifier, see <xref target="RFC4601"/>), or
	    by terminating and reestablishing the connection.</t>

	    <t>If a PORT neighbor changes its GenID and a connection is
	    established or attempting to be established, the local side
	    should generally tear down the connection and do as described in
	    <xref target="down"/>. However, if the connection is shared by
	    multiple interfaces and the GenID changes only for one of them,
	    the local side SHOULD simply send a full update, similar to other
	    cases when a GenID changes for an upstream neighbor.</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Actions When a Connection Goes Down" anchor="down">
	    <t>A connection may go down for a variety of reasons. It may
	    be due to an error condition, or a configuration change.
            A connection SHOULD be shut down as soon as there are
            no more PIM neighbors using it. That is, for the connection
	    we have associated local and remote Connection IDs. When there
	    is no PIM neighbor with that particular remote connection ID on
	    any interface where we announce the local connection ID, the
	    connection SHOULD be shut down. This may happen when a new
	    connection ID is configured, PORT is disabled, or a PIM neighbor
	    expires.</t>

	    <t>If a PIM neighbor expires, one should free connection state
	      and downstream oif-list state for the neighbor. A downstream
	      router, when an upstream neighboring router has expired, will
	      simply update the RPF neighbor for the corresponding state to a
              new neighbor where it would trigger Join/Prune messages. This
              behavior is according to <xref target="RFC4601"/> where also
              the term RPF neighbor is defined. It is required of a 
	      PIM router to clear 
	      its neighbor table for a neighbor who has timed out due to 
	      neighbor holdtime expiration.</t>

	    <t>When a connection is no longer available between two PORT
	      enabled PIM neighbors, they MUST immediately, or on-demand,
	      try to reestablish the connection following the normal rules
	      for connection establishment. The neighbors MUST also start
	      expiry timers so that all oif-list state for the neighbor
	      using the connection, gets expired after J/P_Holdtime, unless
	      it later gets refreshed by receiving new Join/Prunes.</t>
	    
	    <t>The value of J/P_Holdtime is 215 seconds. This value is
	      based on section 4.11 of <xref target="RFC4601"/> which
	      says that J/P_HoldTime should be 3.5 * t_periodic where the
	      default for t_periodic is 60 seconds.</t>

	  <section title="Moving from PORT to Datagram Mode">
	    <t>There may be situations where an administrator decides to
	    stop using PORT. If PORT is disabled on a router interface,
	    or a previously PORT enabled neighbor no longer announces
	    any of the PORT Hello options, the router follows the rules in
	    <xref target="down"/> for taking down connections and starting
	    timers. Next, the router SHOULD trigger a full state update
            similar to what would be done if the GenID changed in Datagram Mode.
            The router SHOULD send Join/Prune messages for any state where the
            router switched from PORT to Datagram Mode for the upstream
	    neighbor.

	  <section title="On-demand versus Pre-configured Connections"
		   anchor="ondemand">
	    <t>Transport connections could be established when they are needed
	    or when a router interface to other PIM neighbors has come up. The
	    advantage of on-demand Transport connection establishment 
	    is the reduction of router resources. Especially in the case
	    where there is no need for a full mesh of connections on a
	    network interface.
	    The disadvantage is additional delay and queueing when a Join/Prune
	    message needs to be sent and a Transport connection is
            not established yet.</t>

	    <t>If a router interface has become operational and PIM neighbors
	    are learned from Hello messages, at that time, Transport 
	    connections may be established. The advantage is that a connection
	    is ready to transport data by the time a Join/Prune message needs
	    to be sent. The disadvantage is there can be more connections 
	    established than needed. This can occur when there is a small set 
	    of RPF neighbors for the active distribution trees compared to
	    the total number of neighbors. Even when Transport connections
	    are pre-established before they are needed, a connection can go
	    down and an implementation will have to deal with an on-demand
	    situation.</t>

	    <t>Note that for TCP, it is the router with the lower Connection
            ID that decides whether to open a connection immediately, or
	    on-demand. The router with the higher Connection ID SHOULD only
	    initiate a
            connection on-demand. That is, if it needs to send a Join/Prune
	    message and there is no currently established connection.</t>

	    <t>Therefore, this specification RECOMMENDS but does not mandate 
	    the use of on-demand Transport connection establishment.</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Possible Hello Suppression Considerations">
	    <t>Based on this specification, a Transport connection cannot
	    be established until a Hello message is received. One reason for
	    this is to determine if the PIM neighbor supports this 
	    specification and the other is to determine the remote address
	    to use to establish the Transport connection.</t>

	    <t>There are cases where it is desirable to suppress entirely the
	    transmission of Hello messages. In this case, it is outside the
	    scope of this document on how to determine if the PIM neighbor
	    supports this specification as well as an out-of-band (outside
	    of the PIM protocol) method to determine the remote address to
	    establish the Transport connection. </t>

	  <section title="Avoiding a Pair of TCP Connections between Neighbors">
	    <t>To ensure that there is only one TCP connection between a pair

	    Note that this section applies only to TCP, for SCTP this is not
	    an issue. Let A and B be two PIM neighbors where A&apos;s
	    Connection ID is numerically
	    smaller than B&apos;s Connection ID, and each is known to the
	    other as having a potential PIM adjacency relationship.</t>

        <section title="PORT Message Definitions" anchor="PM">
	  <t>It may be desirable for scaling purposes to allow Join/Prune
	  messages from different PIM protocol families to be sent over the
	  same Transport connection. Also, it may be desirable to have a set
	  of Join/Prune
	  messages for one address-family sent over a Transport connection that
	  is established over a different address-family network layer.</t>

	  <t>To be able to do this we need a common PORT message format.
          This will provide both record boundary and demux
	  points when sending over a stream protocol like TCP/SCTP.</t>

	  <t>A PORT message may contain PORT options, see <xref target="PO"/>.
	  We will define two PORT options for carrying PIM
	  Join/Prune messages. One for IPv4 and one for IPv6. For each PIM
	  Join/Prune message to be sent over the Transport connection, we
	  send a PORT Join/Prune message containing exactly one such option.
	  </t>

	  <t>Each PORT message will have the Type/Length/Value
	  format. Multiple different TLV types can be sent over the same
	  Transport connection.</t>

	  <t>To make sure PIM Join/Prune messages are delivered as soon as the
	  TCP transport layer receives the Join/Prune buffer, the TCP Push
	  flag will be set in all outgoing Join/Prune messages sent over a
	  TCP transport connection.</t>

	  <t>PORT messages will be sent using destination TCP port number 
	  8471. When using SCTP as the reliable transport, destination
	  port number 8471 will be used. See 
          <xref target="IANA-Considerations" /> for IANA considerations.</t>

	  <t>PORT messages are error checked. This includes unknown/illegal
	  type fields, or a truncated message. If the PORT message contains a
	  PIM Join/Prune Message, then that is subject to the normal PIM
	  error checks, including checksum verification. If any parsing
	  errors occur in a PORT message, it is skipped, and we proceed
	  to any following PORT messages.</t>

	  <t>When an unknown type field is encountered, that message MUST
	  be ignored. As specified above, one then proceeds as usual
	  processing further PORT messages. This is important in order to
	  allow new message types to be specified in the future, without
	  breaking existing implementations. However, if only unknown or
	  invalid messages are received for a longer period of time, an
	  implementation MAY alert the operator. E.g., if a message is
	  sent with a wrong length, the receiver is likely to see only
	  unknown/invalid messages thereafter.</t>

	  <t>The checksum of the PIM Join/Prune message MUST be calculated
	  exactly as specified in section 4.9 of <xref target="RFC4601"/>).
	  For IPv6, <xref target="RFC4601"/> specifies the use of a
	  pseudo-header. For PORT, the exact same pseudo-header MUST be used,
	  but its source and destination address fields MUST be set to 0 when
	  calculating the checksum.</t>

	  <t>The TLV type field is 16 bits. The range 65532 - 65535
	  is for experimental use <xref target="RFC3692"/>.</t>

	  <t>This document defines two message types.</t>

        <section title="Explicit Tracking" anchor="track">
	  <t>When explicit tracking is used, a router keeps track of join
	    state for individual downstream neighbors on a given interface.
	    This MUST be done for all PORT joins and prunes. Note that it
	    may also be done for native join/prune messages, if all neighbors
	    on the LAN have
	    set the T bit of the LAN Prune Delay option (see definition in
	    section 4.9.2 of <xref target="RFC4601"/>). In the discussion
            below we will talk about ET (explicit tracking) neighbors, and
	    non-ET neighbors. The set of ET neighbors MUST include the
            PORT neighbors. The set of non-ET neighbors consists of all the
	    non-PORT neighbors unless all neighbors have set the LAN Prune
            Delay T bit. Then the ET neighbors set contains all neighbors.</t>
     
	  <t>For some link-types,
	  e.g. point-to-point, tracking neighbors is no different than
	  tracking interfaces. It may also be possible for an implementation
	  to treat different downstream neighbors as being on different
	  logical interfaces, even if they are on the same physical link.
	  Exactly how this is implemented and for which link types, is left
	  to the implementer.</t>

          <t>For (*,G) and (S,G) state, the router starts forwarding 
	  traffic on an interface when a Join is received from a neighbor
	  on such an interface. When a non-ET neighbor sends a Prune, as
	  specified <xref target="RFC4601"/>, if no Join is sent to override
	  this Prune before the expiration of the Override Timer, the
	  upstream router concludes that no non-ET neighbor is interested.
	  If no ET neighbors are interested, the interface can be removed
          from the oif-list. When an ET neighbor sends a Prune, one
          removes the join state for that neighbor. If no other ET or
          non-ET neighbors are interested, the interface can be
          removed from the oif-list. When a PORT neighbor sends a prune,
	  there can be no Prune Override, since the Prune is not visible
	  to other neighbors.</t>

          <t>For (S,G,rpt) state, the router needs to track Prune state on
	  the shared tree. It needs to know which ET neighbors have sent
          prunes, and whether any non-ET neighbors have sent prunes.
          Normally one would
          forward a packet from a source S to a group G out on an interface
          if a (*,G)-join is received, but no (S,G,rpt)-prune. With ET one
          needs to do this check per ET neighbor. That is, the packet
          should be forwarded unless all ET neighbors that have sent
          (*,G)-joins have also sent (S,G,rpt)-prunes, and if a non-ET
	  neighbor has sent a (*,G)-join, whether there also is non-ET
	  (S,G,rpt)-prune state.</t>
        </section>
        
	<section title="Multiple Address-Family Support">
	<t>To allow for efficient use of router resources, one can
	mux Join/Prune messages of different address families on the
	same Transport connection.
	There are two ways this can be accomplished, one using a common
	message format over a TCP connection and the other using multiple
        streams over a single SCTP connection.</t>
	
	<t>Using the common message format described previously in this
	specification, using different PORT options, both IPv4 and IPv6 based
	Join/Prune messages can be encoded within the same Transport connection.
	</t>

	<t>When using SCTP multi-streaming, the common message format is
	still used to convey address family information but an SCTP association
	is used, on a per-family basis, to send data concurrently for multiple
	families. When data is sent concurrently, head of line blocking,
	which can occur when using TCP, is avoided.</t>
	</section>

        <section title="Miscellany">
          <t>There are no changes to processing of other PIM messages like PIM
          Asserts, Grafts, Graft-Acks, Registers, and Register-Stops. This
	  goes for BSR and Auto-RP type messages as well.</t>
        
          <t>This extension is applicable only to PIM-SM, PIM-SSM and 
	  Bidir-PIM. It does not take requirements for PIM-DM into 
	  consideration.</t>
        </section>

	<section title="Transport Considerations">
	  <t>As noted in the introduction, this is an experimental
	  extension to PIM, and using reliable delivery for PIM messages
	  is a new concept. There are several potential transport related
	  concerns. Hopefully experiences from early implementations and
	  deployments will reveal what concerns are relevant and how to
	  resolve them.</t>

	  <t>One consideration is keep-alive mechanisms. We have defined
	  an optional Keep-alive mechanism for PORT, see
	  <xref target="conman"/>. Also SCTP and many TCP implementations
	  provide keep-alive mechanisms that could be used. When to use
	  keep-alive messages and which mechanism is unclear, although we
	  believe the PORT keep-alive allows for better application control.
	  It is unclear what holdtimes are preferred for the PORT Keep-alives.
	  For now it is RECOMMENDED that administrators can configure whether
	  to use keep-alives, what holdtimes etc.</t>

	  <t>In a stable state it is expected that only occasional small
	  messages are sent over a PORT connection. This depends on how
	  often PIM Join/Prune state changes. Thus, over a long period of
	  time, there may be only small messages that never use the entire
	  TCP congestion window, and the window may become very large. This
	  would then be an issue if there is a state change making PORT
	  send a very large message. It may be good if the TCP stack
	  provides some rate-limiting or burst-limiting. The congestion
	  control mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC3465"/> may be of
	  help.</t>

	  <t>With PORT, it is possible as discussed in the previous
	  paragraph that only occasional small messages are sent. This
	  may cause problems for the TCP retransmit mechanism. In particular,
	  the TCP Fast Retransmit algorithm may never get triggered. For
	  further discussion of this and a possible solution, see
	  <xref target="RFC3042"/>.</t>

	  <t>While the above two paragraphs only discuss TCP issues, there
	  may also be similar issues regarding SCTP.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Manageability Considerations">
	  <t>This document defines using TCP or SCTP transports between
	  pairs of PIM neighbors. It is recommended that this mechanism
	  is disabled by default. An administrator can then enable PORT
	  TCP and/or SCTP on PIM enabled interfaces. If two neighbors
	  both have PORT SCTP (and if not, if both PORT TCP) they will
	  only use SCTP (alternatively TCP) for PIM Join/Prune messages.
	  This is the case even when the connection is down (there is no
	  fallback to native Join/Prune messages).
	  </t><t>
	  When PORT support is enabled, a router sends PIM Hello messages
	  announcing support for TCP and/or SCTP and also Connection IDs.
	  It should be possible to configure a local Connection ID, and
	  also to see what PORT capabilities and Connection IDs PIM neighbors
	  are announcing. Based on these advertisements, pairs of PIM
	  neighbors will decide whether to try to establish a PORT connection.
	  There should be a way for an operator to check the current connection
	  state. Statistics on the number of PORT messages sent and received
	  (including number of invalid messages) may also be helpful</t>
	  <t>For connection security (see <xref target="consec"/>), it should
	  be possible to enable a GTSM check to only accept connections
	  (TCP/SCTP packets) when the sender is within a certain number of
	  router hops. Also one should be able to configure the use of TCP-AO.
	  </t><t>
	  For connection maintenance (see <xref target="conman"/>),
	  it is recommended to support Keep-Alive messages. It should be 
	  configurable whether to send Keep-Alives. In that case, also
	  wheter to use a Holdtime, and what Holdtime to use.
	  </t><t>
	  There should be some way to alert an operator when PORT
	  connections are going down, or when there is a failure in
	  establishing a PORT connection. Also information like the number
	  of connection failures, and how long the connection has been
	  up or down, is useful.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Security Considerations">
  	  <t>There are several security issues related to the use of TCP
	    or SCTP transports. One can do off-path attacks sending
	    packets with a spoofed source address. Either establishing

	  <t>This specification makes use of a TCP port number

	  <section title="PORT Option Type Registry">
	    <t>A registry for PORT option types is requested. The option
	    type is a 16-bit integer, with values from 0 to 65535. The
	    type space is split in two ranges, 0 - 32767 for Critical
	    Options and 32768 - 65535 for Non-Critical Options.
	    Option types are assigned by IANA, except the ranges
	    32764 - 32767 and 65532 - 65535 that are
	    for experimental use <xref target="RFC3692"/>. An RFC is required 
	    for the IANA assignments. An RFC defining a new option type
	    must specify whether the option is Critical or Non-Critical
	    in order for IANA to assign a type. This document defines
	    two Critical PORT Option types. Type 1, PIM IPv4 Join/Prune
	    Message; and Type 2, PIM IPv6 Join/Prune Message.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a DHCPv6 option which is meant

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

    </section>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="I-D.softwire-ds-lite">Dual-Stack Lite</xref> is a
	solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers which
	are addressed only with an IPv6 prefix (no IPv4 address is assigned to
	the attachment device). One of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6
	tunnel, commonly referred to as a Softwire.  A DS-Lite &quot;Basic
	Bridging BroadBand&quot; (B4) device will not know if the network it
	is attached to offers Dual-Stack Lite service, and if it did would not
	know the remote endpoint of the tunnel to establish a softwire.</t>

      <t>To inform the B4 of the Address Family Transition Router's (AFTR)
	location, a <xref target="RFC1035">DNS</xref> hostname may be used.
	Once this information is conveyed, the presence of the configuration
	indicating the AFTR's location also informs a host to initiate
	Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) service and become a Softwire Initiator.</t>

      <t>To provide the conveyance of the configuration information, a single
        <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> option is used, expressing the
        AFTR's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to the B4 element.</t>

      <t>The details of how the B4 establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire
	to the AFTR are out of scope for this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='The AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option' anchor='option-name'>
      <t>The AFTR-Name option consists of option-code and option-len fields
	(as all DHCPv6 options have), and a variable length
        tunnel-endpoint-name field containing a fully qualified domain name
        that refers to the AFTR which the client MAY connect to.</t>

      <t>The AFTR-Name option SHOULD NOT appear in any other than the
        following DHCPv6 messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,
        Information-Request and Reply.</t>

      <t>The format of the AFTR-Name option is shown in the following
	figure:</t>

    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+

        OPTION_AFTR_NAME: (TBD)

              option-len: Length of the tunnel-endpoint-name field in
                          octets.

    tunnel-endpoint-name: A fully qualified domain name of the AFTR
                          tunnel endpoint.
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The tunnel-endpoint-name field is formatted as
        required in <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> Section 8
        (&quot;Representation and Use of Domain Names&quot;).  Briefly, the
        format described is using a single octet noting the length of one
        DNS label (limited to at most 63 octets), followed by the label
        contents.  This repeats until all labels in the FQDN are exhausted,
        including a terminating zero-length label.  Any updates to Section 8
	of <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> also apply to encoding of this
	field.  An example format for this option is shown in
	<xref target="fqdn-example"/>, which conveys the FQDN
	&quot;aftr.example.com.&quot;.</t>

      <figure align="center" anchor="fqdn-example"
       title="Example tunnel-endpoint-name.">
        <artwork>
    +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
    | 0x04 |   a  |   f  |   t  |   r  | 0x07 |   e  |   x  |   a  |
    +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
    |   m  |   p  |   l  |   e  | 0x03 |   c  |   o  |   m  | 0x00 |
    +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Note that in the specific case of the
        <xref target="fqdn-example">example tunnel-endpoint-name</xref>,
	the length of the tunnel-endpoint-name is 18 octets, and so an
	option-len field value of 18 would be used.</t>

      <!--<t>The option is validated by confirming that the option-len is greater
	than 3, that the option data can be contained by the option length
	(that the option length does not run off the end of the packet), that
	individual label lengths do not exceed the option length, and
	that the tunnel-endpoint-name is of valid format as described in
	<xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6 Section 8</xref>; there are no
	compression tags, there is at least one label of nonzero
	length.</t>-->

      <t>The option is validated by confirming that all of the
      following conditions are met:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>the option-len is greater than 3;</t>
        <t>the option data can be contained by the option length
          (that the option length does not run off the end of the
          packet);</t>
        <t>the individual label lengths do not exceed the option length;</t>
        <t>the tunnel-endpoint-name is of valid format as described in
        DHCPv6 Section 8 <xref target="RFC3315"/>;</t>
        <t>there are no compression tags;</t>
        <t>there is at least one label of nonzero length.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>A DHCPv6 server SHOULD NOT send more than one AFTR-Name
        option.  It SHOULD NOT permit the configuration of multiple names
        within one AFTR-Name option.  Both of these conditions are handled
	exceptionally by the client, so an operator using software that does
	not perform these validations should be careful not to configure
	multiple domain names.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2</xref>
        describes how a DHCPv6 client and server negotiate configuration
        values using the Option Request Option (OPTION_ORO).  As a convenience
        to the reader, we mention here that a server will not reply with a
        AFTR-Name option if the client has not explicitly enumerated it on
        its Option Request Option.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>A client that supports the B4 functionality of DS-Lite (defined
        in <xref target="I-D.softwire-ds-lite"/>) and conforms to 
	this specification MUST include OPTION_AFTR_NAME on its OPTION_ORO.</t>

      <t>Because it requires DNS name to address resolution, the client MAY
        also wish to include the
        <xref target="RFC3646">OPTION_DNS_SERVERS</xref> option on its
        OPTION_ORO.</t>

      <t>If the client receives the AFTR-Name option, it MUST verify the
        option contents as described in <xref target="option-name"/>.</t>

      <t>Note that in different environments, the B4 element and DHCPv6 client
	may be integrated, joined, or separated by a third pieces of software.
	For the purpose of this specification, we refer to the "B4 system" when
	specifying implementation steps that may be processed at any stage of
	integration between the DHCPv6 client software and the B4 element it is
	configuring.</t>

      <t>If the B4 system receives more than one AFTR-Name option, it
        MUST use only the first instance of that option.</t>

      <t>If the AFTR-Name option contains more than one FQDN,
        as distinguished by the presence of multiple root labels, the B4
	system MUST use only the first FQDN listed in configuration.</t>

      <t>The B4 system performs standard DNS resolution using the provided FQDN
        to resolve a AAAA Resource Record, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC3596"/> and STD 13 <xref target="RFC1034"/>
        <xref target="RFC1035"/>.</t>

      <t>If any DNS response contains more than one IPv6 address, the B4 system
        picks only one IPv6 address and uses it as a remote tunnel endpoint for
        the interface being configured in the current message exchange.
        The B4 system MUST NOT establish more than one DS-Lite tunnel at the
        same time per interface.  For a redundancy and high availability
        discussion, see Section 12.3 &quot;High availability&quot; of
        <xref target="I-D.softwire-ds-lite"/>.</t>

      <t>Note that a B4 system may have multiple network interfaces, and these
        interfaces may be configured differently; some may be connected to
        networks that call for DS-Lite, and some may be connected to networks
        that are using normal dual stack or other means.  The B4 system should
        approach this specification on an interface-by-interface basis.  For
	example, if the B4 system is attached to multiple networks that provide
	the AFTR Name option, then the B4 system MUST configure a tunnel for
	each interface separately as each DS-Lite tunnel provides IPv4
	connectivity for each distinct interface. Means to bind a
        AFTR Name and DS-Lite tunnel configuration to a given interface in a
        multiple interfaces device are out of scope of this document.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document does not present any new security issues, but as with
	all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely possible that
	the configuration is being delivered by a third party (Man In The
	Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust that the access the
	DS-Lite Softwire connection represents can be trusted, and it should
	not therefore bypass any security mechanisms such as IP firewalls.</t>

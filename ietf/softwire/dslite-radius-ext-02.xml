    <abstract>
      <t>Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6
      connectivity to customers which are addressed only with an IPv6 prefix.
      DS-Lite requires to pre-configure the AFTR tunnel information on the B4
      element. In many networks, the customer profile information may be
      stored in AAA servers while client configurations are mainly provided
      through DHC protocol. This document specifies one new RADIUS attribute
      to carry Dual-Stack Lite Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) name;
      the RADIUS attribute is defined based on the equivalent DHCPv6 option
      already specified in draft-ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option. This
      RADIUS attribute is meant to be used between the RADIUS Server and the
      NAS, it is not intended to be used directly between the B4 element and
      the RADIUS Server.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Dual-Stack Lite <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite"></xref> is a solution to
      offer both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers which are addressed
      only with an IPv6 prefix (no IPv4 address is assigned to the attachment
      device). One of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, but a
      DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) will not know if the network it is
      attached to offers Dual-Stack Lite support, and if it did, would not
      know the remote end of the tunnel to establish a connection.</t>

      <t>To inform the B4 of the AFTR's location, a Fully Qualified Domain
      Name (FQDN) may be used. Once this information is conveyed, the presence
      of the configuration indicating the AFTR's location also informs a host
      to initiate Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) service and become a Softwire
      Initiator.</t>

      <t>The draft draft-ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option"></xref> specifies a
      DHCPv6 option which is meant to be used by a Dual-Stack Lite client
      (Basic Bridging BroadBand element, B4) to discover its Address Family
      Transition Router (AFTR) name. In order to be able to populate such
      option the DHCPv6 Server must be pre-provisioned with the Address Family
      Transition Router (AFTR) name.</t>

      <t>In Broadband environments, customer profile may be managed by AAA
      servers, together with user Authentication, Authorization, and
      Accounting (AAA). RADIUS protocol <xref target="RFC2865"></xref> is
      usually used by AAA Servers to communicate with network elements. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access"></xref> describes a typical
      broadband network scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS) acts
      as the access gateway for the users (hosts or CPEs) and the NAS embeds a
      DHCPv6 Server function that allows it to locally handle any DHCPv6
      requests issued by the clients.</t>

      <t>Since the DS-Lite AFTR information can be stored in AAA servers and
      the client configuration is mainly provided through DHC protocol running
      between the NAS and the requesting clients, a new RADIUS attribute is
      needed to send AFTR information from AAA server to the NAS.</t>

      <t>This document aims at defining a new RADIUS attribute to be used for
      carrying the DS-Lite Tunnel Name, based on the equivalent DHCPv6 option
      already specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option"></xref></t>

      <t>The <xref target="fig1"></xref> illustrates how the RADIUS protocol
      and DHCPv6 work together to accomplish DS-Lite configuration on the B4
      element when a PPP Session is used to provide connectivity to the
      user.</t>

      <t>The Network Access Server (NAS) operates as a client of RADIUS and as
      DHCP Server for DHC protocol. The NAS initially sends a RADIUS Access
      Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting authentication. Once
      the RADIUS server receives the request, it validates the sending client
      and if the request is approved, the AAA server replies with an Access
      Accept message including a list of attribute-value pairs that describe
      the parameters to be used for this session. This list may also contain
      the AFTR Tunnel Name. When the NAS receives a DHCPv6 client request
      containing the DS-Lite tunnel Option, the NAS shall use the address
      returned in the RADIUS DS-Lite-Tunnel-Addr attribute to populate the
      DHCPv6 OPTION_DS_LITE_ADDR option in the DHCPv6 reply message.</t>

      <t>The only difference between this message flow and previous one is
      that in this scenario the interaction between NAS and AAA/ RADIUS Server
      is triggered by the DHCPv6 Solicit message received by the NAS from the

      is the PPP LCP Config Request message received by the NAS.</t>

Internet-Draft     Floating-Point Textual Conventions          June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines textual conventions for the representation of
   floating-point numbers.  All of these definitions are in terms of the
   IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic, IEEE 754-2008
   [IEEE.754.2008].

   The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic, IEEE 754-2008
   [IEEE.754.2008], provides for a variety of interchange formats for
   floating point numbers.  The need for three of these, namely

   o  32-bit,

   o  64-bit,

   o  128-bit,

   has been recognized in network management.  For example, Section
   4.2.3 of the SMIng Objectives [RFC3216] elaborates the need for these
   three floating-point data types in network management protocols.

   The selection of a floating-point format involves many considerations
   and trade-offs.  For an introduction to the fundamentals of floating-
   point representations see chapter 4 of [KNUTH], and for a a
   discussion of these issues specifically with respect to the IEEE
   formats, see [GOLDBERG].

   All of these textual conventions employ the binary interchange format
   defined in [IEEE.754.2008].  Specifically, this means that for all of
   them, the highest-order bit of the first byte is the sign bit, with
   the remaining bits of the octet string corresponding to the exponent
   and fraction parts, in network byte order.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Applicability

   The following list highlights some of the issues MIB designers need
   to consider when deciding whether to employ these textual
   conventions:

   o  Floating point numbers are useful if the number space needs to
      cover a large dynamic range.  For number spaces with a limited
      range, fixed point numbers can be more efficient and more precise.

   o  Floating point numbers are typically the wrong answer for data
      that is truly decimal or can be handled adequately by re-thinking
      the units and representing the scaled numbers as integers.

   o  The SNMP "lexicographical" ordering for INDEX objects using these
      floating point textual conventions will simply be that of the
      octet strings corresponding to the floating point representations,
      which will not always reflect the numerical ordering of the
      corresponding floating point values.  Even if MIB designers take
      this into account, users might still find the results of a MIB
      "walk" surprising.  Consequently, it is suggested that whenever
      one of these textual conventions is used for an INDEX object, that
      the DESCRIPTION clause should provide some warning.

   o  Embedded systems sometimes lack floating point support, which can
      complicate the implementation of MIB objects using floating point
      numbers.

   o  In choosing from among the types defined in this memo, MIB
      designers need to consider both the range and the precision
      needed, as well as recognize that it could be inefficient to use,
      for example, Float128TC when Float64TC would do.

   o  Since these textual conventions are defined in terms of the OCTET
      STRING type, the SMI's mechanisms for formally setting range
      constraints are not available.  MIB designers using these textual
      conventions will need to use DESCRIPTION clauses to spell out any
      applicable range constraints beyond those implied by the
      underlying IEEE types.

   o  Whenever these textual conventions are used in a MIB module, the
      associated DESCRIPTION clause will need to clearly specify whether
      denormalized numbers, NaNs ("not a number") or infinities are
      permitted, along with any special semantics associated with these
      cases.  This is especially important for writeable objects.

4.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This MIB module defines three textual conventions.  It defines no MIB
   objects.

4.1.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   This MIB module employs definitions from [RFC2578] and [RFC2579].

4.2.  Documents required for REFERENCE clauses

   This MIB module contains REFERENCE clauses making reference to IEEE
   754-2008 [IEEE.754.2008].

6.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions that can be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this memo has no
   impact on the security of the Internet.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:



      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------
      floatTcMIB        { mib-2 XXX }


   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

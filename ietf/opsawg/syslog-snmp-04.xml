    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        SNMP and SYSLOG are two widely used protocols to communicate
        event notifications. Although co-existence of several
        management protocols in one operational environment is
        possible, certain environments require that all event
        notifications are collected by a single system daemon such as
        a SYSLOG collector or an SNMP notification receiver via a
        single management protocol. In such environments, it is
        necessary to translate event notifications between management
        protocols.
      </t>
      <t>
        The latest version of SYSLOG, specified in
        <xref target="RFC5424"/>, supports a structured data element
        format. Structured data elements allow us to map between SNMP
        notifications and SYSLOG messages without losing
        information. In this memo we specify a concrete mapping from
        SNMP event notifications <xref target="RFC3416"/> into SYSLOG
        messages <xref target="RFC5424"/>. We specify how the SYSLOG
        message format should be utilized to carry the information
        contained in an SNMP notification message. A new SYSLOG
        structured data element is defined which carries the PDU
        portion of an SNMP notification message.
      </t>
      <section title="Conventions">
        <t>
          A system which has the capability of receiving SNMP
          notification messages from an SNMP Notification Originator
          and sending the SNMP data contained inside in a SYSLOG
          message format to a SYSLOG collector is referred in this memo
          as an "SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator". By definition, such a
          system should have an SNMP Notification Receiver application
          and a SYSLOG originator running in order to be able
          to perform the functions of an "SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator".

          A detailed introduction to the SNMP Management Framework can
          be found in <xref target="RFC3410"/>. The SNMP Management
          Architecture is described in
          <xref target="RFC3411"/>. Managed objects are accessed via a
          virtual information store, termed the Management Information
          Base or MIB <xref target="RFC3418"/>. Objects in the MIB are
          defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI
          <xref target="RFC2578"/>.

          An SNMP notification message is generated and transmitted by
          an SNMP entity on behalf of a Notification Originator
          application <xref target="RFC3413"/>. SNMP notifications are
          often used to notify a Notification Receiver application at
          a logically remote SNMP entity that an event has occurred or
          that a certain condition is present. There are two types of
          SNMP protocol operations that are associated with SNMP
          notification messages <xref target="RFC3416"/>:

          <xref target="RFC3418"/> respectively. If the OBJECTS clause
          is present in the invocation of the corresponding
          NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro, then each corresponding variable,
          as instantiated by this notification, is copied, in order,
          to the variable-bindings field. If any additional variables
          are being included (at the option of the generating SNMP
          entity), then each is copied to the variable-bindings
          field.

          In the case of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c notifications, the

          This document assumes that notifications are in the format
          defined in RFC 3416 <xref target="RFC3416"/>. Notifications

      <t>
        In this section, we define how the scopedPDU portion from a
        SNMP notification message is used to generate a message in the
        SYSLOG format. The notification receiver application at the
        SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator is listening for incoming
        notifications. After a notification is received by the SNMP
        engine the data portion is forwarded to the notification
        receiver application. The data portion contains the scopedPDU
        of the message which is used by the SYSLOG originator on the
        SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator to generate a SYSLOG message and
        send it to a SYSLOG collector (or proxy). Note that every SNMP
        notification maps to exactly one SYSLOG message.

      <t>
	A common deployment scenario is shown in
        <xref target="deployment"/>.  There can be many SNMP
        notification originators which send SNMP event notifications
        to a SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator. The SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator
        extracts the data portion of the notification, generates a
        SYSLOG message, and send the SYSLOG message to a SYSLOG
        collector, which is responsible for collecting and storing all
        notification messages. The arrows in <xref target="deployment"/>
	indicate message flows, not individual messages.
      </t>
      <t>
        The SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator is not transparent for a SYSLOG
        collector. The global header of the SYSLOG message generated by
        the SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator is filled with parameters that
        are specific for the system running the SNMP-to-SYSLOG
        translator such as its hostname, time stamp, etc. The data
        portion (scopedPDU for SNMPv3 or PDU for SNMPv1/SNMPv2c) of
        the SNMP notification message is contained in the structured
        data of the SYSLOG message.
      </t>
      <t>
        Implementations MUST drop invalid SNMP messages before they
        are passed to the SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator.

        <t>
          The SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator fills the HEADER field of a
          SYSLOG message with parameters specific to the system on
          which it is running. The default facility level for SYSLOG
          messages containing SNMP notifications SHOULD be 3, which
          corresponds to messages generated by system daemons. The
          default severity level SHOULD be 5, which correponds to
          "Notice: normal but significant condition". If the
          SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator has a notion of the type of
          notification that has been received it might choose other
          values for facility and severity level.

          The VERSION, TIMESTAMP, HOSTNAME, APP-NAME, PROCID and MSGID

          translator is running. The character set used in the HEADER
          MUST be seven-bit ASCII in an eight-bit field as described

          Each SNMP-SD-ELEMENT starts with the SD-ID "snmp". The first
          two SD-ID parameters are "ctxEngine" and "ctxName". The
          context MUST be present in an SNMPv3 notification and
          therefore they MUST be present in a SYSLOG message generated
          by an SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator from an SNMPv3
          notification. The contexdEngineID is encoded as an
          hexadecimal string while the contextName is encoded as a
          UTF8 string.
        </t>
        <t>
          The remaining parameters in the "snmp" SD-ID correspond to
          the varbind list elements contained in the SNMP PDU. The
          name of a varbind is encoded as an OID in dotted
          notation. The rendered OID is carried in a "vN" parameter,
          where N identifies the position of the varbind in the
          varbind list of the SNMP message (the first varbind having
          the position 1). A MIB aware implementation may in addition
          generate a parameter "lN" carrying the descriptor of the
          associated MIB object plus the instance identifier suffix
          (also called an OID label). The number N again identifies
          the position of the varbind in the varbind list of the SNMP
          message.

          The value of a varbind is encoded depending on its type
          according to the rules shown in <xref target="mapping"/> and
          type specific parameter names are used to convey the type
          information.  The number N again identifies the position of
          the varbind in the varbind list of the SNMP message. A MIB
          aware implementation may in addition generate a parameter
          "aN" carrying a alternate textual representation of the
          value, which is obtained by applying DISPLAY-HINTs and
          translating named numbers into corresponding labels or
          OBJECT IDENTIFIER values to descriptors. For SNMP object
          types that have a DISPLAY-HINT of the form 'Ma' or 'Mt'
          where M is some number, a MIB aware implementation can
          choose to include the "aN" parameter and to suppress the
          corresponding "xN" parameter. This special case allows to
          save space for textual objects. A receiver receiving a "aN"
          parameter without a matching value at position N can
          unambiguously convert the value carried in the "aN"
          parameter back to an OCTET STRING value.
        </t>
        <t>
          While the inclusion of additional parameters carrying OID
          labels or alternate value representations increases human
          readability, this comes at the cost of increased message
          size which may cause truncation of SYSLOG message.
          Therefore, implementations SHOULD provide a configuration
          mechanism to enable/disable the generation of parameters
          carrying OID labels or alternate value representations.

        A companion document defines an SNMP MIB module to represent
        SYSLOG messages and to send SYSLOG messages as SNMP
        notifications to SNMP notification receivers
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-syslog-msg-mib"/>.  This section
        discusses the possibilities of using both specifications in
        combination.
      </t>
      <t>
	A SYSLOG collector implementing the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB module and
	the mapping of SNMP notifications to SYSLOG messages may be
	configured to translate received SYSLOG messages containing
	SNMP notifications back into the original SNMP notification.
	In this case, the relevant tables of the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB will
	not be populated for SYSLOG messages carrying SNMP
	notifications. This configuration allows operators to build a
	forwarding chain where SNMP notifications are "tunneled"
	through SYSLOG messages. Due to size restrictions of the
	SYSLOG transports and the more verbose textual encoding used
	by SYSLOG, there is a possibility that SNMP notification
	content gets truncated while tunneled through SYSLOG and thus
	the resulting SNMP notification may be incomplete.
      </t>
      <t>
	An SNMP management application supporting the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB
	and the mapping of SNMP notifications to SYSLOG messages may
	process information from the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB in order to emit a
	SYSLOG message representing the SYSLOG message recorded in the
	SYSLOG-MSG-MIB module. This configuration allows operators to
	build a forwarding chain where SYSLOG messages are "tunneled"
	through SNMP messages. A notification receiver can determine
	whether a syslogMsgNotification contained all structured data
	element parameters of a SYSLOG message. In case parameters are
	missing, a forwarding application MUST retrieve the missing
	parameters from the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB. Regular polling of the
	SYSLOG-MSG-MIB can be used to take care of any lost SNMP
	notifications.

        The corresponding SYSLOG message has a priority value of 29
        which means a facility level of 3 (system daemons) and a
        severity level of 5 (Notice: Normal but significant condition)
        according to the algorithm for calculation of priority value
        specified in Section 6.2.1 of <xref target="RFC5424"/>. The
        rest of the fields in the header of the SYSLOG message are
        parameters that are specific to the system running the
        SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator. The SYSLOG version is 1 and the
        message was generated at 22:14:15.003Z on 2003-10-11T by the
        host "mymachine.example.com". The application on the
        SNMP-to-SYSLOG translator that generated the message was
        "snmptrapd", there is no information about the process id and
        the message on the SNMP-to-SYSLOG system is identified with
        the MSGID of ID47.

      <t>
        The SYSLOG message contains one structured data element with a
        SD-ID of "snmp" which means that this is the scopedPDU portion
        of an SNMP event notification message. The data which is
        contained in the notification is associated with the
        ContextEngineID "123456" and ContextName "ctx1". The
        request-id of the SNMP notification message was
        "7145575". Then follows the data portion of the scopedPDU. The
        first two variables contained in the data portion are always
        the sysUpTime.0 and snmpTrapOID.0. An snmpTrapOID.0 with a
        value of "1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4" means that this is a linkUp
        trap. The parameters v3="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.3" d3="3" mean that
        the SNMP notification message is carrying the ifIndex object
        which has a type INTEGER and has a value of 3.  The parameters
        v4="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7.3" d4="1" mean that the SNMP
        notification message is carrying the object ifAdminStatus
        which has type INTEGER and a value of 1. The parameters
        v5="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.3" d5="1" mean that the SNMP
        notification message is carrying the object ifOperStatus which

        The SNMP architecture supports an access control mechanism
        ensuring that SNMP notifications are only sent to receivers
        who are authorized to receive the notification. Network
        operators using this mapping of SNMP notifications to SYSLOG
        messages should enforce a consistent policy preventing people
        from accessing SNMP notifications via the SYSLOG mapping that

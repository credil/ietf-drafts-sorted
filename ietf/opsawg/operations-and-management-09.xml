      <t>New protocols or protocol extensions are best designed with due
      consideration of functionality needed to operate and manage the
      protocols. Retrofitting operations and management is sub-optimal. The
      purpose of this document is to provide guidance to authors and reviewers
      of documents defining new protocols or protocol extensions, about
      covering aspects of operations and management that should be
      considered.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Often when new protocols or protocol extensions are developed, not
      enough consideration is given to how the protocol will be deployed,
      operated and managed. Retrofitting operations and management mechanisms
      is often hard and architecturally unpleasant, and certain protocol
      design choices may make deployment, operations, and management
      particularly hard. This document provides guidelines to help protocol
      designers and working groups consider the operations and management
      functionality for their new IETF protocol or protocol extension at an
      earlier phase.</t>

      <section title="Designing for Operations and Management">
        <t>The operational environment and manageability of the protocol
        should be considered from the start when new protocols are
        designed.</t>

        <t>Most of the existing IETF management standards are focused on using
        SMI-based data models (MIB modules) to monitor and manage networking
        devices. As the Internet has grown, IETF protocols have addressed a
        constantly growing set of needs, such as web servers and collaboration
        services and applications. The number of IETF management technologies
        has been expanding and the IETF management strategy has been changing
        to address the emerging management requirements. The discussion of
        emerging sets of management requirements has a long history in the
        IETF. The set of management protocols you should use depends on what
        you are managing.</t>

        <t>Protocol designers should consider which operations and management
        needs are relevant to their protocol, document how those needs could
        be addressed, and suggest (preferably standard) management protocols
        and data models that could be used to address those needs. This is
        similar to a working group (WG) that considers which security threats
        are relevant to their protocol, documents how threats should be
        mitigated, and then suggests appropriate standard protocols that could
        mitigate the threats.</t>

        <t>When a WG considers operation and management functionality for a
        protocol, the document should contain enough information to understand
        how the protocol will be deployed and managed, and the WG should
        expect that considerations for operations and management may need to
        be updated in the future, after further operational experience has
        been gained.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="This Document">
        <t>This document makes a distinction between "Operational
        Considerations" and "Management Considerations", although the two are
        closely related. The section on manageability is focused on management
        technology such as how to utilize management protocols and how to
        design management data models. The operational considerations apply to
        operating the protocol within a network, even if there were no
        management protocol actively being used.</t>

        <t>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance about what to
        consider when thinking about the management and deployment of a new
        protocol, and to provide guidance about documenting the
        considerations. The following guidelines are designed to help writers
        provide a reasonably consistent format for such documentation.
        Separate manageability and operational considerations sections are
        desirable in many cases, but their structure and location is a
        decision that can be made from case to case.</t>

        <t>This document does not impose a solution, or imply that a formal
        data model is needed, or imply that using a specific management
        protocol is mandatory. If protocol designers conclude that the
        technology can be managed solely by using proprietary command line
        interfaces (CLIs), and no structured or standardized data model needs
        to be in place, this might be fine, but it is a decision that should
        be explicit in a manageability discussion, that this is how the
        protocol will need to be operated and managed. Protocol designers
        should avoid having manageability pushed for a later phase of the
        development of the standard.</t>

        <t>This document discusses the importance of considering operations
        and management by setting forth a list of guidelines and a checklist
        of questions to consider, which a protocol designer or reviewer can
        use to evaluate whether the protocol and documentation address common
        operations and management needs. Operations and management are highly
        dependent on their environment, so most guidelines are subjective
        rather than objective.</t>

        <!--
      <t>This document provides some objective criteria to promote interoperability
      through the use of standard management interfaces, such as &quot;did you
      design counters in a MIB module for monitoring packets in/out of an
      interface?&quot; <xref target="RFC2863">The Interfaces Group MIB
</xref>, &quot;did you write an XML-based
      data model for configuring your protocol with Netconf?&quot; <xref
      target="RFC4741">NETCONF Configuration Protocol</xref>, and &quot;did you standardize syslog message
      content and structured data elements for reporting events that might
      occur when operating your protocol?&quot; <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol"></xref> and &quot;did you consider appropriate notifications in case of failure situations?&quot;</t>

-->
      </section>

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>For years the IETF community has used the IETF Standard Management
        Framework, including the Simple Network Management Protocol <xref
        target="RFC3410"></xref>, the Structure of Management Information
        <xref target="RFC2578"></xref>, and MIB data models for managing new
        protocols. As the Internet has evolved, operators have found the
        reliance on one protocol and one schema language for managing all
        aspects of the Internet inadequate. The IESG policy to require working
        groups to write a MIB module to provide manageability for new
        protocols is being replaced by a policy that is more open to using a
        variety of management protocols and data models designed to achieve
        different goals.</t>

        <t>This document provides some initial guidelines for considering
        operations and management in an IETF Management Framework that
        consists of multiple protocols and multiple data modeling languages,
        with an eye toward being flexible while also striving for
        interoperability.</t>

        <t>Fully new protocols may require significant consideration of
        expected operations and management, while extensions to existing
        widely-deployed protocols may have established defacto operations and
        management practices that are already well understood.</t>

        <t>Suitable management approaches may vary for different areas,
        working groups, and protocols in the IETF. This document does not
        prescribe a fixed solution or format in dealing with operational and
        management aspects of IETF protocols. However, these aspects should be
        considered for any IETF protocol, because we develop technologies and
        protocols to be deployed and operated in the real world Internet. It
        is fine if a WG decides that its protocol does not need interoperable
        management or no standardized data model, but this should be a
        deliberate decision, not the result of omission. This document
        provides some guidelines for those considerations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Background">
        <t>There have been a significant number of efforts, meetings, and
        documents that are related to Internet operations and management. Some
        of them are mentioned here, to help protocol designers find
        documentation of previous efforts. Hopefully, providing these
        references will help the IETF avoid rehashing old discussions and
        reinventing old solutions.</t>

        <t>In 1988, the IAB published <xref target="RFC1052">IAB
        Recommendations for the Development of Internet Network Management
        Standards</xref> which recommended a solution that, where possible,
        deliberately separates modeling languages, data models, and the
        protocols that carry data. The goal is to allow standardized
        information and data models to be used by different protocols.</t>

        <t>In 2001, OPS Area design teams were created to document
        requirements related to configuration of IP-based networks. One output
        was "Requirements for Configuration Management of IP-based Networks"
        <xref target="RFC3139"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In 2003, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop on
        Network Management <xref target="RFC3535"></xref> that discussed the
        strengths and weaknesses of some IETF network management protocols,
        and compared them to operational needs, especially configuration.</t>

        <t>One issue discussed was the user-unfriendliness of the binary
        format of SNMP <xref target="RFC3410"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC3084">COPS Usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR)</xref>,
        and it was recommended that the IETF explore an XML-based Structure of
        Management Information, and an XML-based protocol for
        configuration.</t>

        <t>Another conclusion was that the tools for event/alarm correlation
        and for root cause analysis and logging are not sufficient, and that
        there is a need to support a human interface and a programmatic
        interface. The IETF decided to standardize aspects of the de facto
        standard for system logging security and programmatic support.</t>

        <t>In 2006, the IETF discussed whether the Management Framework should
        be updated to accommodate multiple IETF schema languages for
        describing the structure of management information, and multiple IETF
        standard protocols for performing management tasks. The IESG asked
        that a document be written to discuss how protocol designers and
        working groups should address management in this emerging
        multi-protocol environment. This document, and some planned companion
        documents, attempt to provide some guidelines for navigating the
        rapidly-shifting operating and management environments.</t>

    <!-- Introduction -->

    <section anchor="opcons"
             title="Operational Considerations - How Will the New Protocol Fit Into the Current Environment?">
      <t>Designers of a new protocol should carefully consider the operational
      aspects. To ensure that a protocol will be practical to deploy in the
      real world, it is not enough to merely define it very precisely in a
      well-written document. Operational aspects will have a serious impact on
      the actual success of a protocol. Such aspects include bad interactions
      with existing solutions, a difficult upgrade path, difficulty of
      debugging problems, difficulty configuring from a central database, or a
      complicated state diagram that operations staff will find difficult to
      understand.</t>

      <t>BGP flap damping <xref target="RFC2439"></xref> is an example. It was
      designed to block high frequency route flaps, however the design did not
      consider the existence of BGP path exploration/slow convergence. In real
      operations, path exploration caused false flap damping, resulting in
      loss of reachability. As a result, many networks turned flap damping
      off.</t>

      <section anchor="opsmodel" title="Operations">
        <t>Protocol designers can analyze the operational environment and mode
        of work in which the new protocol or extension will work. Such an
        exercise need not be reflected directly by text in their document, but
        could help in visualizing how to apply the protocol in the Internet
        environments where it will be deployed.</t>

        <t>A key question is how the protocol can operate "out of the box". If
        implementers are free to select their own defaults, the protocol needs
        to operate well with any choice of values. If there are sensible
        defaults, these need to be stated.</t>

        <t>There may be a need to support a human interface, e.g., for
        troubleshooting, and a programmatic interface, e.g., for automated
        monitoring and root cause analysis. The application programming
        interfaces and the human interfaces might benefit from being similar
        to ensure that the information exposed by these two interfaces is
        consistent when presented to an operator. Identifying consistent
        methods of determining information, such as what gets counted in a
        specific counter, is relevant.</t>

        <!--A human interface, such as a command line interface, is
        useful for troubleshooting, while a programmatic interface is
        important for managing multiple devices in a consistent manner, and
        automating repetitive functions. Graphical user interfaces can help an
        operator comprehend an overview of the network quickly (one picture is
        worth a thousand words), but an operator may also require seeing the
        raw data to better understand just what is happening in the network.
        Ease of use is a key requirement for any network management technology
        from the operators point of view. Protocol designers should consider how
        various protocol choices might impact ease of use in different
        scenarios. -->

        <t>Protocol designers should consider what management operations are
        expected to be performed as a result of the deployment of the protocol
        - such as whether write operations will be allowed on routers and on
        hosts, or whether notifications for alarms or other events will be
        expected.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="opsinstall" title="Installation and Initial Setup">
        <t>Anything that can be configured can be misconfigured.
        "Architectural Principles of the Internet" <xref
        target="RFC1958"></xref> Section 3.8 states: "Avoid options and
        parameters whenever possible. Any options and parameters should be
        configured or negotiated dynamically rather than manually."</t>

        <t>To simplify configuration, protocol designers should consider
        specifying reasonable defaults, including default modes and
        parameters. For example, it could be helpful or necessary to specify
        default values for modes, timers, default state of logical control
        variables, default transports, and so on. Even if default values are
        used, it must be possible to retrieve all the actual values or at
        least an indication that known default values are being used.</t>

        <t>Protocol designers should consider how to enable operators to
        concentrate on the configuration of the network as a whole rather than
        on individual devices. Of course, how one accomplishes this is the
        hard part.</t>

        <t>It is desirable to discuss the background of chosen default values,
        or perhaps why a range of values makes sense. In many cases, as
        technology changes, the values in an RFC might make less and less
        sense. It is very useful to understand whether defaults are based on
        best current practice and are expected to change as technologies
        advance or whether they have a more universal value that should not be
        changed lightly. For example, the default interface speed might be
        expected to change over time due to increased speeds in the network,
        and cryptographical algorithms might be expected to change over time
        as older algorithms are "broken".</t>

        <t>It is extremely important to set a sensible default value for all
        parameters</t>

        <t>The default value should stay on the conservative side rather than
        on the "optimizing performance" side. (example: the initial RTT and
        RTTvar values of a TCP connection)</t>

        <t>For those parameters that are speed-dependent, instead of using a
        constant, try to set the default value as a function of the link speed
        or some other relevant factors. This would help reduce the chance of
        problems caused by technology advancement.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="opsmig" title="Migration Path">
        <t>If the new protocol is a new version of an existing one, or if it
        is replacing another technology, the protocol designer should consider
        how deployments should transition to the new protocol. This should
        include co-existence with previously deployed protocols and/or
        previous versions of the same protocol, incompatibilities between
        versions, translation between versions, and side-effects that might
        occur. Are older protocols or versions disabled or do they co-exist in
        the network with the new protocol?</t>

        <t>Many protocols benefit from being incrementally deployable -
        operators may deploy aspects of a protocol before deploying the
        protocol fully.</t>

               title="Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components">
        <t>Protocol designers should consider the requirements that the new
        protocol might put on other protocols and functional components, and
        should also document the requirements from other protocols and
        functional elements that have been considered in designing the new
        protocol.</t>

        <t>These considerations should generally remain illustrative to avoid
        creating restrictions or dependencies, or potentially impacting the
        behavior of existing protocols, or restricting the extensibility of
        other protocols, or assuming other protocols will not be extended in
        certain ways. If restrictions or dependencies exist, they should be
        stated.</t>

        <t>For example, the design of <xref target="RFC2205">Resource
        ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)</xref> required each router to look at the
        RSVP PATH message, and if the router understood RSVP, to add its own
        address to the message to enable automatically tunneling through
        non-RSVP routers. But in reality routers cannot look at an otherwise
        normal IP packet, and potentially take it off the fast path! The
        initial designers overlooked that a new "deep packet inspection"
        requirement was being put on the functional components of a router.
        The "router alert" option <xref target="RFC2113"></xref> <xref
        target="RFC2711"></xref> was finally developed to solve this problem
        for RSVP and other protocols that require the router to take some
        packets off the fast forwarding path. Router alert has its own
        problems in impacting router performance.</t>

      <section anchor="opsimpact" title="Impact on Network Operation">
        <t>The introduction of a new protocol or extensions to an existing
        protocol may have an impact on the operation of existing networks.
        Protocol designers should outline such impacts (which may be positive)
        including scaling concerns and interactions with other protocols. For
        example, a new protocol that doubles the number of active, reachable
        addresses in use within a network might need to be considered in the
        light of the impact on the scalability of the interior gateway
        protocols operating within the network.</t>

        <t>A protocol could send active monitoring packets on the wire. If we
        don't pay attention, we might get very good accuracy, but could send
        too many active monitoring packets.</t>

        <t>The protocol designer should consider the potential impact on the
        behavior of other protocols in the network and on the traffic levels
        and traffic patterns that might change, including specific types of
        traffic such as multicast. Also consider the need to install new
        components that are added to the network as result of the changes in
        the configuration, such as servers performing auto-configuration
        operations.</t>

        <t>The protocol designer should consider also the impact on
        infrastructure applications like <xref target="RFC1034">DNS</xref>,
        the registries, or the size of routing tables. For example, <xref
        target="RFC5321">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</xref> servers
        use a reverse DNS lookup to filter out incoming connection requests.
        When Berkeley installed a new spam filter, their mail server stopped
        functioning because of the DNS cache resolver overload.</t>

        <t>The impact on performance may also be noted - increased delay or
        jitter in real-time traffic applications, or response time in
        client-server applications when encryption or filtering are
        applied.</t>

        <t>It is important to minimize the impact caused by configuration
        changes. Given configuration A and configuration B, it should be
        possible to generate the operations necessary to get from A to B with
        minimal state changes and effects on network and systems.</t>

      <section anchor="opsverify" title="Verifying Correct Operation">
        <t>The protocol designer should consider techniques for testing the
        effect that the protocol has had on the network by sending data
        through the network and observing its behavior (aka active
        monitoring). Protocol designers should consider how the correct
        end-to-end operation of the new protocol in the network can be tested
        actively and passively, and how the correct data or forwarding plane
        function of each network element can be verified to be working
        properly with the new protocol. Which metrics are of interest?</t>

        <t>Having simple protocol status and health indicators on network

    <section title="Management Considerations - How Will The Protocol be Managed?">
      <t>The considerations of manageability should start from identifying the
      entities to be managed, and how the managed protocol is supposed to be
      installed, configured and monitored.</t>

      <t>Considerations for management should include a discussion of what
      needs to be managed, and how to achieve various management tasks. Where
      are the managers and what type of management interfaces and protocols
      will they need? The "write a MIB module" approach to considering
      management often focuses on monitoring a protocol endpoint on a single
      device. A MIB module document typically only considers monitoring
      properties observable at one end, while the document does not really
      cover managing the *protocol* (the coordination of multiple ends), and
      does not even come near managing the *service* (which includes a lot of
      stuff that is very far away from the box). This is exactly what
      operators hate - you need to be able to manage both ends. As <xref
      target="RFC3535"></xref> says, MIB modules can often be characterized as
      a list of ingredients without a recipe.</t>

      <t>The management model should take into account factors such as: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>what type of management entities will be involved (agents,
          network management systems)?</t>

          <t>what is the possible architecture (client-server, manager-agent,
          poll-driven or event-driven, autoconfiguration, two levels or
          hierarchical)?</t>

          <t>what are the management operations - initial configuration,
          dynamic configuration, alarm and exception reporting, logging,
          performance monitoring, performance reporting, debugging?</t>

          <t>how are these operations performed - locally, remotely, atomic
          operation, scripts? Are they performed immediately or time scheduled
          or event triggered?</t>

          <!--
			<t>what are the typical user interfaces - Command line (CLI) or
            graphical user interface (GUI)?</t>
            -->
        </list></t>

      <t>Protocol designers should consider how the new protocol will be
      managed in different deployment scales. It might be sensible to use a
      local management interface to manage the new protocol on a single
      device, but in a large network, remote management using a centralized
      server and/or using distributed management functionality might make more
      sense. Auto-configuration and default parameters might be possible for
      some new protocols.</t>

      <t>Management needs to be considered not only from the perspective of a
      device, but also from the perspective of network and service management
      perspectives. A service might be network and operational functionality
      derived from the implementation and deployment of a new protocol. Often
      an individual network element is not aware of the service being
      delivered.</t>

      <t>WGs should consider how to configure multiple related/co-operating
      devices and how to back off if one of those configurations fails or
      causes trouble. NETCONF <xref target="RFC4741"></xref> addresses this in
      a generic manner by allowing an operator to lock the configuration on
      multiple devices, perform the configuration settings/changes, check that
      they are OK (undo if not) and then unlock the devices.</t>

      <t>Techniques for debugging protocol interactions in a network must be
      part of the network management discussion. Implementation source code
      should be debugged before ever being added to a network, so asserts and
      memory dumps do not normally belong in management data models. However,
      debugging on-the-wire interactions is a protocol issue: while the
      messages can be seen by sniffing, it is enormously helpful if a protocol
      specification supports features that make debugging of network
      interactions and behaviors easier. There could be alerts issued when
      messages are received, or when there are state transitions in the
      protocol state machine. However, the state machine is often not part of
      the on-the-wire protocol; the state machine explains how the protocol
      works so that an implementer can decide, in an implementation-specific
      manner, how to react to a received event.</t>

      <t>In a client/server protocol, it may be more important to instrument
      the server end of a protocol than the client end, since the performance
      of the server might impact more nodes than the performance of a specific
      client.</t>

      <section anchor="intermgmt" title="Interoperability">
        <t>Just as when deploying protocols that will inter-connect devices,
        management interoperability should be considered, whether across
        devices from different vendors, across models from the same vendor, or
        across different releases of the same product. Management
        interoperability refers to allowing information sharing and operations
        between multiple devices and multiple management applications, often
        from different vendors. Interoperability allows for the use of 3rd
        party applications and the outsourcing of management services.</t>

        <t>Some product designers and protocol designers assume that if a
        device can be managed individually using a command line interface or a
        web page interface, that such a solution is enough. But when equipment
        from multiple vendors is combined into a large network, scalability of
        management may become a problem. It may be important to have
        consistency in the management interfaces so network-wide operational
        processes can be automated. For example, a single switch might be
        easily managed using an interactive web interface when installed in a
        single office small business, but when, say, a fast food company
        installs similar switches from multiple vendors in hundreds or
        thousands of individual branches and wants to automate monitoring them
        from a central location, monitoring vendor-and-model-specific web
        pages would be difficult to automate.</t>

        <t>The primary goal is the ability to roll out new useful functions
        and services in a way in which they can be managed in a scalable
        manner, where one understands the network impact (as part of the total
        cost of operations) of that service.</t>

        <t>Getting everybody to agree on a single syntax and an associated
        protocol to do all management has proven to be difficult. So
        management systems tend to speak whatever the boxes support, whether
        the IETF likes this or not. The IETF is moving from support for one
        schema language for modeling the structure of management information
        (<xref target="RFC2578">Structure of Management Information Version 2
        (SMIv2) </xref>) and one simple network management protocol (<xref
        target="RFC3410">Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</xref>)
        towards support for additional schema languages and additional
        management protocols suited to different purposes. Other Standard
        Development Organizations (e.g. DMTF, TMF) also define schemas and
        protocols for management and these may be more suitable than IETF
        schemas and protocols in some cases. Some of the alternatives being
        considered include <list>
            <t><xref target="W3C.REC-xmlschema-0-20010502">XML Schema

            logging</t>

            <t>and others</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Interoperability needs to be considered on the syntactic level and
        the semantic level. While it can be irritating and time-consuming,
        application designers including operators who write their own scripts
        can make their processing conditional to accommodate syntactic
        differences across vendors or models or releases of product.</t>

        <t>Semantic differences are much harder to deal with on the manager
        side - once you have the data, its meaning is a function of the
        managed entity.</t>

        <t>Information models are helpful to try to focus interoperability on
        the semantic level - they establish standards for what information
        should be gathered, and how gathered information might be used
        regardless of which management interface carries the data or which
        vendor produces the product. The use of an information model might
        help improve the ability of operators to correlate messages in
        different protocols where the data overlaps, such as a SYSLOG message
        and an SNMP notification about the same event. An information model
        might identify which error conditions should be counted separately,
        and which error conditions can be counted together in a single
        counter. Then, whether the counter is gathered via SNMP or a CLI
        command or a SYSLOG message, the counter will have the same
        meaning.</t>

        <t>Protocol designers should consider which information might be
        useful for managing the new protocol or protocol extensions.</t>

      <section anchor="datamgmt" title="Management Information">
        <t>Languages used to describe an information model can influence the
        nature of the model. Using a particular data modeling language, such
        as the SMIv2, influence the model to use certain types of structures,
        such as two-dimensional tables. This document recommends using English
        text (the official language for IETF specifications) to describe an
        information model. A sample data model could be developed to
        demonstrate the information model.</t>

        <t>A management information model should include a discussion of what
        is manageable, which aspects of the protocol need to be configured,
        what types of operations are allowed, what protocol-specific events
        might occur, which events can be counted, and for which events should
        an operator be notified.</t>

        <t>Operators find it important to be able to make a clear distinction
        between configuration data, operational state, and statistics. They
        need to determine which parameters were administratively configured
        and which parameters have changed since configuration as the result of
        mechanisms such as routing protocols or network management protocols.
        It is important to be able to separately fetch current configuration
        information, initial configuration information, operational state
        information, and statistics from devices, and to be able to compare
        current state to initial state, and to compare information between
        devices. So when deciding what information should exist, do not
        conflate multiple information elements into a single element.</t>

        <t>What is typically difficult to work through are relationships
        between abstract objects. Ideally an information model would describe
        the relationships between the objects and concepts in the information
        model.</t>

        <t>Is there always just one instance of this object or can there be
        multiple instances? Does this object relate to exactly one other
        object or may it relate to multiple? When is it possible to change a
        relationship?</t>

        <t>Do objects (such as rows in tables) share fate? For example, if a
        row in table A must exist before a related row in table B can be
        created, what happens to the row in table B if the related row in
        table A is deleted? Does the existence of relationships between
        objects have an impact on fate sharing?</t>

        <section title="Information Model Design">
          <t>This document recommends keeping the information model as simple
          as possible by applying the following criteria: <list

              <t>Start with a small set of essential objects and add only as

      <section anchor="faultmgmt" title="Fault Management">
        <t>The protocol designer should document the basic faults and health
        indicators that need to be instrumented for the new protocol, and the
        alarms and events that must be propagated to management applications
        or exposed through a data model.</t>

        <t>The protocol designer should consider how fault information will be
        propagated. Will it be done using asynchronous notifications or
        polling of health indicators?</t>

        <t>If notifications are used to alert operators to certain conditions,
        then the protocol designer should discuss mechanisms to throttle
        notifications to prevent congestion and duplications of event
        notifications. Will there be a hierarchy of faults, and will the fault
        reporting be done by each fault in the hierarchy, or will only the
        lowest fault be reported and the higher levels be suppressed? Should
        there be aggregated status indicators based on concatenation of
        propagated faults from a given domain or device?</t>

        <t>SNMP notifications and SYSLOG messages can alert an operator when
        an aspect of the new protocol fails or encounters an error or failure
        condition, and SNMP is frequently used as a heartbeat monitor. Should
        the event reporting provide guaranteed accurate delivery of the event
        information within a given (high) margin of confidence? Can we poll
        the latest events in the box?</t>

        <section title="Liveness Detection and Monitoring">
          <t>Protocol designers should always build in basic testing features
          (e.g. ICMP echo, UDP/TCP echo service, NULL RPC calls) that can be
          used to test for liveness, with an option to enable and disable
          them.</t>

          <t>Mechanisms for monitoring the liveness of the protocol and for
          detecting faults in protocol connectivity are usually built into
          protocols. In some cases, mechanisms already exist within other
          protocols responsible for maintaining lower layer connectivity (e.g.
          ICMP echo), but often new procedures are required to detect failures
          and to report rapidly, allowing remedial action to be taken.</t>

          <t>These liveness monitoring mechanisms do not typically require
          additional management capabilities. However, when a system detects a
          fault, there is often a requirement to coordinate recovery action
          through management applications or at least to record the fact in an
          event log.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Fault Determination">
          <t>It can be helpful to describe how faults can be pinpointed using
          management information. For example, counters might record instances
          of error conditions. Some faults might be able to be pinpointed by
          comparing the outputs of one device and the inputs of another device
          looking for anomalies. Protocol designers should consider what
          counters should count. If a single counter provided by vendor A
          counts three types of error conditions, while the corresponding
          counter provided by vendor B counts seven types of error conditions,
          these counters cannot be compared effectively - they are not
          interoperable counters.</t>

          <t>How do you distinguish between faulty messages and good
          messages?</t>

          <t>Would some threshold-based mechanisms, such as RMON events/alarms
          or the EVENT-MIB, be useable to help determine error conditions? Are
          SNMP notifications for all events needed, or are there some
          "standard" notifications that could be used? or can relevant
          counters be polled as needed?</t>

          <t>It might be useful to isolate or quarantine faults, such as
          isolating a device that emits malformed messages that are necessary
          to coordinate connections properly. This might be able to be done by
          configuring next-hop devices to drop the faulty messages to prevent
          them from entering the rest of the network.</t>

      <section anchor="confmgmt" title="Configuration Management">
        <t>A protocol designer should document the basic configuration
        parameters that need to be instrumented for a new protocol, as well as
        default values and modes of operation.</t>

        <t>What information should be maintained across reboots of the device,
        or restarts of the management system?</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC3139">"Requirements for Configuration Management
        of IP-based Networks"</xref> discusses requirements for configuration
        management, including discussion of different levels of management,
        high-level-policies, network-wide configuration data, and device-local
        configuration. Network configuration is not just multi-device push or
        pull. It is knowing that the configurations being pushed are
        semantically compatible. Is the circuit between them configured
        compatibly on both ends? is the is-is metric the same? ... now do that
        for 1,000 devices.</t>

        <t>A number of efforts have existed in the IETF to develop
        policy-based configuration management. <xref
        target="RFC3198">"Terminology for Policy-Based Management"</xref> was
        written to standardize the terminology across these efforts.</t>

        <!--      <t>It is highly desirable that text processing tools such as diff, and
        version management tools such as RCS or CVS or SVN, can be used to
        process configurations. This approach simplifies comparing the current
        operational state to the initial configuration. It is commonplace to compare 
        configuration changes to e.g., last day, last week, last month, etc. Having 
        configuration in a text, and human-understandable format is very valuable 
        for various reasons such as change control (or verification), configuration 
        consistency checks, etc.</t>

        <t>With structured text such as XML, simple text diffs may be found to
        be inadequate and more sophisticated tools may be needed to make any
        useful comparison of versions.</t>
-->

        <t>Implementations should not arbitrarily modify configuration data.
        In some cases (such as Access Control Lists) the order of data items
        is significant and comprises part of the configured data. If a
        protocol designer defines mechanisms for configuration, it would be
        desirable to standardize the order of elements for consistency of
        configuration and of reporting across vendors, and across releases
        from vendors.</t>

        <t>There are two parts to this: 1. An NMS system could optimize access
        control lists (ACLs) for performance reasons 2. Unless the device/NMS
        systems has correct rules/a lot of experience, reordering ACLs can
        lead to a huge security issue.</t>

        <t>Network wide configurations may be stored in central master
        databases and transformed into formats that can be pushed to devices,
        either by generating sequences of CLI commands or complete
        configuration files that are pushed to devices. There is no common
        database schema for network configuration, although the models used by
        various operators are probably very similar. Many operators consider
        it desirable to extract, document, and standardize the common parts of
        these network wide configuration database schemas. A protocol designer
        should consider how to standardize the common parts of configuring the
        new protocol, while recognizing that vendors may also have proprietary
        aspects of their configurations.</t>

        <!--
        <t>It is important to distinguish between the distribution of
        configurations and the activation of a certain configuration. Devices
        should be able to hold multiple configurations. NETCONF <xref
        target="RFC4741"></xref>, for example, differentiates between the
        "running" configuration and "candidate" configurations.</t>
     -->

        <t>It is important to enable operators to concentrate on the
        configuration of the network as a whole rather than individual
        devices. Support for configuration transactions across a number of
        devices could significantly simplify network configuration management.
        The ability to distribute configurations to multiple devices, or
        modify candidate configurations on multiple devices, and then activate
        them in a near-simultaneous manner might help. Protocol designers can
        consider how it would make sense for their protocol to be configured
        across multiple devices. Configuration-templates might also be
        helpful.</t>

        <t>Consensus of the 2002 IAB Workshop <xref target="RFC3535"></xref>
        was that textual configuration files should be able to contain
        international characters. Human-readable strings should utilize UTF-8,
        and protocol elements should be in case insensitive ASCII.</t>

        <t>A mechanism to dump and restore configurations is a primitive
        operation needed by operators. Standards for pulling and pushing
        configurations from/to devices are desirable.</t>

        <t>Given configuration A and configuration B, it should be possible to
        generate the operations necessary to get from A to B with minimal
        state changes and effects on network and systems. It is important to
        minimize the impact caused by configuration changes.</t>

        <t>A protocol designer should consider the configurable items that
        exist for the control of function via the protocol elements described
        in the protocol specification. For example, sometimes the protocol
        requires that timers can be configured by the operator to ensure
        specific policy-based behavior by the implementation. These timers
        should have default values suggested in the protocol specification and
        may not need to be otherwise configurable.</t>

        <section title="Verifying Correct Operation">
          <t>An important function that should be provided is guidance on how
          to verify the correct operation of a protocol. A protocol designer
          could suggest techniques for testing the impact of the protocol on
          the network before it is deployed, and techniques for testing the
          effect that the protocol has had on the network after being
          deployed.</t>

          <t>Protocol designers should consider how to test the correct
          end-to-end operation of the network or service, and how to verify
          the correct functioning of the protocol, whether it is the data or
          forwarding plane function of each network element, or the function
          of service. This may be achieved through status and statistical
          information gathered from devices.</t>

      <section anchor="acctmgmt" title="Accounting Management">
        <t>A protocol designer should consider whether it would be appropriate
        to collect usage information related to this protocol, and if so, what
        usage information would be appropriate to collect.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC2975">"Introduction to Accounting
        Management"</xref> discusses a number of factors relevant to
        monitoring usage of protocols for purposes of capacity and trend
        analysis, cost allocation, auditing, and billing. The document also
        discusses how some existing protocols can be used for these purposes.
        These factors should be considered when designing a protocol whose
        usage might need to be monitored, or when recommending a protocol to
        do usage accounting.</t>

      <section anchor="perfmgmt" title="Performance Management">
        <t>From a manageability point of view it is important to determine how
        well a network deploying the protocol or technology defined in the
        document is doing. In order to do this the network operators need to
        consider information that would be useful to determine the performance
        characteristics of a deployed system using the target protocol.</t>

        <t>The IETF, via the Benchmarking Methodology WG (BMWG), has defined
        recommendations for the measurement of the performance characteristics
        of various internetworking technologies in a laboratory environment,
        including the systems or services that are built from these
        technologies. Each benchmarking recommendation describes the class of
        equipment, system, or service being addressed; discuss the performance
        characteristics that are pertinent to that class; clearly identify a
        set of metrics that aid in the description of those characteristics;
        specify the methodologies required to collect said metrics; and
        lastly, present the requirements for the common, unambiguous reporting
        of benchmarking results. Search for "benchmark" in the RFC search
        tool.</t>

        <t>Performance metrics may be useful in multiple environments, and for
        different protocols. The IETF, via the IP Performance Monitoring
        (IPPM) WG, has developed a set of standard metrics that can be applied
        to the quality, performance, and reliability of Internet data delivery
        services. These metrics are designed such that they can be performed
        by network operators, end users, or independent testing groups. The
        existing metrics might be applicable to the new protocol. Search for
        "metric" in the RFC search tool. In some cases, new metrics need to be
        defined. It would be useful if the protocol documentation identified
        the need for such new metrics. For performance monitoring, it is often
        important to report the time spent in a state rather than the current
        state. Snapshots are of less value for performance monitoring.</t>

        <t>There are several parts to performance management to be considered:
        protocol monitoring, device monitoring (the impact of the new
        protocol/service activation on the device), network monitoring, and
        service monitoring (the impact of service activation on the
        network).</t>

        <section title="Monitoring the Protocol">
          <t>Certain properties of protocols are useful to monitor. The number
          of protocol packets received, the number of packets sent, and the
          number of packets dropped are usually very helpful to operators.</t>

          <t>Packet drops should be reflected in counter variable(s) somewhere
          that can be inspected - both from the security point of view and
          from the troubleshooting point of view.</t>

          <t>Counter definitions should be unambiguous about what is included
          in the count, and what is not included in the count.</t>

          <t>Consider the expected behaviors for counters - what is a
          reasonable maximum value for expected usage? Should they stop
          counting at the maximum value and retain the maximum value, or
          should they rollover? How can users determine if a rollover has
          occurred, and how can users determine if more than one rollover has
          occurred?</t>

          <t>Consider whether multiple management applications will share a
          counter; if so, then no one management application should be allowed
          to reset the value to zero since this will impact other
          applications.</t>

          <t>Could events, such as hot-swapping a blade in a chassis, cause
          discontinuities in counter? Does this make any difference in
          evaluating the performance of a protocol?</t>

          <t>The protocol document should make clear the limitations implicit
          within the protocol and the behavior when limits are exceeded. This
          should be considered in a data-modeling independent manner - what
          makes managed-protocol sense, not what makes
          management-protocol-sense. If constraints are not
          managed-protocol-dependent, then it should be left for the
          management-protocol data modelers to decide. For example, VLAN
          identifiers have a range of 1..4095 because of the VLAN standards. A
          MIB implementing a VLAN table should be able to support 4096 entries
          because the content being modeled requires it.</t>

      <section anchor="secmgmt" title="Security Management">
        <t>Protocol designers should consider how to monitor and to manage
        security aspects and vulnerabilities of the new protocol.</t>

        <t>There will be security considerations related to the new protocol.
        To make it possible for operators to be aware of security-related
        events, it is recommended that system logs should record events, such
        as failed logins, but the logs must be secured.</t>

        <t>Should a system automatically notify operators of every event
        occurrence, or should an operator-defined threshold control when a
        notification is sent to an operator?</t>

        <t>Should certain statistics be collected about the operation of the
        new protocol that might be useful for detecting attacks, such as the
        receipt of malformed messages, or messages out of order, or messages
        with invalid timestamps? If such statistics are collected, is it
        important to count them separately for each sender to help identify
        the source of attacks?</t>

        <t>Manageability considerations that are security-oriented might
        include discussion of the security implications when no monitoring is
        in place, the regulatory implications of absence of audit-trail or
        logs in enterprises, exceeding the capacity of logs, and security
        exposures present in chosen / recommended management mechanisms.</t>

        <t>Consider security threats that may be introduced by management
        operations. For example CAPWAP breaks the structure of monolithic
        Access Points (AP) into Access Controllers and Wireless Termination
        Points (WTP). By using a management interface, internal information
        that was previously not accessible is now exposed over the network and
        to management applications and may become a source of potential
        security threats.</t>

        <t>The granularity of access control needed on management interfaces
        needs to match operational needs. Typical requirements are a
        role-based access control model and the principle of least privilege,
        where a user can be given only the minimum access necessary to perform
        a required task.</t>

        <t>Some operators wish to do consistency checks of access control
        lists across devices. Protocol designers should consider information
        models to promote comparisons across devices and across vendors to
        permit checking the consistency of security configurations.</t>

        <t>Protocol designers should consider how to provide a secure
        transport, authentication, identity, and access control which
        integrates well with existing key and credential management
        infrastructure. It is a good idea to start with defining the threat
        model for the protocol, and from that deducing what is required.</t>

        <t>Protocol designers should consider how access control lists are
        maintained and updated.</t>

        <t>Standard SNMP notifications or SYSLOG messages <xref
        target="RFC5424"></xref> might already exist, or can be defined, to
        alert operators to the conditions identified in the security
        considerations for the new protocol. For example, you can log all the
        commands entered by the operator using syslog (giving you some degree
        of audit trail), or you can see who has logged on/off using SSH from
        where, failed SSH logins can be logged using syslog, etc.</t>

        <t>An analysis of existing counters might help operators recognize the
        conditions identified in the security considerations for the new
        protocol before they can impact the network.</t>

        <!--
        <t>RADIUS and DIAMETER can provide authentication and authorization. A
        protocol designer should consider which attributes would be
        appropriate for their protocol.</t>

removed in response to comment from Adrian: This paragraph is apropos of what? What are you trying to tell me?
Should I run my management using Radius? Should I try to build
Diameter into my new protocol?
-->

        <t>Different management protocols use different assumptions about
        message security and data access controls. A protocol designer that
        recommends using different protocols should consider how security will
        be applied in a balanced manner across multiple management interfaces.
        SNMP authority levels and policy are data-oriented, while CLI
        authority levels and policy are usually command (task) oriented.
        Depending on the management function, sometimes data-oriented or
        task-oriented approaches make more sense. Protocol designers should
        consider both data-oriented and task-oriented authority levels and
        policy.</t>

    <section title="Documentation Guidelines">
      <t>This document is focused on what to think about, and how to document
      the considerations of the protocol designer.</t>

      <section title="Recommended Discussions">
        <t>A Manageability Considerations section should include discussion of
        the management and operations topics raised in this document, and when
        one or more of these topics is not relevant, it would be useful to
        contain a simple statement explaining why the topic is not relevant
        for the new protocol. Of course, additional relevant topics should be
        included as well.</t>

        <t>Existing protocols and data models can provide the management
        functions identified in the previous section. Protocol designers
        should consider how using existing protocols and data models might
        impact network operations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Null Manageability Considerations Sections">
        <t>A protocol designer may seriously consider the manageability
        requirements of a new protocol, and determine that no management
        functionality is needed by the new protocol. It would be helpful to
        those who may update or write extensions to the protocol in the future
        or to those deploying the new protocol to know the thinking of the
        working regarding the manageability of the protocol at the time of its
        design.</t>

        <t>If there are no new manageability or deployment considerations, it
        is recommended that a Manageability Considerations section contain a
        simple statement such as "There are no new manageability requirements
        introduced by this document," and a brief explanation of why that is
        the case. The presence of such a Manageability Considerations section
        would indicate to the reader that due consideration has been given to
        manageability and operations.</t>

        <t>In the case where the new protocol is an extension, and the base
        protocol discusses all the relevant operational and manageability
        considerations, it would be helpful to point out the considerations
        section in the base document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Placement of Operations and Manageability Considerations Sections ">
        <t>If a protocol designer develops a Manageability Considerations
        section for a new protocol, it is recommended that the section be
        placed immediately before the Security Considerations section.
        Reviewers interested in such sections could find it easily, and this
        placement could simplify the development of tools to detect the
        presence of such a section.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document is informational and provides guidelines for
      considering manageability and operations. It introduces no new security
      concerns.</t>

      <t>The provision of a management portal to a network device provides a
      doorway through which an attack on the device may be launched. Making
      the protocol under development be manageable through a management
      protocol creates a vulnerability to a new source of attacks. Only
      management protocols with adequate security apparatus, such as
      authentication, message integrity checking, and authorization should be
      used.</t>

      <t>A standard description of the manageable knobs and whistles on a
      protocol makes it easier for an attacker to understand what they may try
      to control and how to tweak it.</t>

      <t>A well-designed protocol is usually more stable and secure. A
      protocol that can be managed and inspected offers the operator a better
      chance of spotting and quarantining any attacks. Conversely making a
      protocol easy to inspect is a risk if the wrong person inspects it.</t>

      <t>If security events cause logs and or notifications/alerts, a
      concerted attack might be able to be mounted by causing an excess of
      these events. In other words, the security management mechanisms could
      constitute a security vulnerability. The management of security aspects
      is important (see <xref target="secmgmt"></xref>).</t>

    <section title="Operations and Management Review Checklist">
      <!--  start of checklist -->

      <t>This appendix provides a quick checklist of issues that protocol
      designers should expect operations and management expert reviewers to
      look for when reviewing a document being proposed for consideration as a
      protocol standard.</t>

      <section title="Operational Considerations">
        <t>Has deployment been discussed? see <xref target="opsmodel"></xref>
        <list>
            <t>Does the document include a description of how this protocol or
            technology is going to be deployed and managed?</t>

            <t>Is the proposed specification deployable? If not, how could it
            be improved?</t>

            <t>Does the solution scale well from the operational and
            management perspective? Does the proposed approach have any
            scaling issues that could affect usability for large scale
            operation?</t>

            <t>Are there any coexistence issues?</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Has installation and initial setup been discussed? see <xref
        target="opsinstall"></xref> <list>
            <t>Is the solution sufficiently configurable?</t>

            <t>Are configuration parameters clearly identified?</t>

            <t>Are configuration parameters normalized?</t>

            <t>Does each configuration parameter have a reasonable default
            value?</t>

            <t>Will configuration be pushed to a device by a configuration
            manager, or pulled by a device from a configuration server?</t>

            <t>How will the devices and managers find and authenticate each
            other?</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Has the migration path been discussed? see <xref
        target="opsmig"></xref> <list>
            <t>Are there any backward compatibility issues?</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Have the Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components
        been discussed? see <xref target="opsdep"></xref>. <list>
            <t>What protocol operations are expected to be performed relative
            to the new protocol or technology, and what protocols and data
            models are expected to be in place or recommended to ensure for
            interoperable management?</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Has the Impact on Network Operation been discussed? see <xref
        target="opsimpact"></xref> <list>
            <t>Will the new protocol significantly increase traffic load on
            existing networks?</t>

            <t>Will the proposed management for the new protocol significantly
            increase traffic load on existing networks?</t>

            <t>How will the new protocol impact the behavior of other
            protocols in the network? Will it impact performance (e.g. jitter)
            of certain types of applications running in the same network?</t>

            <t>Does the new protocol need supporting services (e.g. DNS or
            AAA) added to an existing network?</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Have suggestions for verifying correct operation been discussed?
        see <xref target="opsverify"></xref> <list>
            <t>How can one test end-to-end connectivity and throughput?</t>

            <t>Which metrics are of interest?</t>

            <t>Will testing have an impact on the protocol or the network?</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Has management interoperability been discussed? see <xref
        target="intermgmt"></xref> <list>
            <t>Is a standard protocol needed for interoperable management?</t>

            <t>Is a standard information or data model needed to make
            properties comparable across devices from different vendors?</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Are there fault or threshold conditions that should be reported?
        see <xref target="faultmgmt"></xref> <list>
            <t>Does specific management information have time utility?</t>

            <t>Should the information be reported by notifications? polling?
            event-driven polling?</t>

            <t>Is notification throttling discussed?</t>

            <t>Is there support for saving state that could be used for
            root-cause analysis?</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Is configuration discussed? see <xref target="confmgmt"></xref>
        <list>
            <t>Are configuration defaults, and default modes of operation
            considered?</t>

            <t>Is there discussion of what information should be preserved
            across reboots of the device or the management system? Can devices
            realistically preserve this information through hard reboots where
            physical configuration might change (e.g. cards might be swapped
            while a chassis is powered down)?</t>

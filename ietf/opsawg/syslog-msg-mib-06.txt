Internet-Draft               SYSLOG-MSG-MIB                  August 2009


1.  Introduction

   SNMP [RFC3410] [RFC3411] and SYSLOG [RFC5424] are two widely used
   protocols to communicate event notifications.  Although co-existence
   of several management protocols in one operational environment is
   possible, certain environments require that all event notifications
   are collected by a single system daemon such as a SYSLOG collector or
   an SNMP notification receiver via a single management protocol.  In
   such environments, it is necessary to translate event notifications
   between management protocols.

   This document defines an SNMP MIB module to represent SYSLOG messages
   and to send SYSLOG messages as SNMP notifications to SNMP
   notification receivers.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580] .


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  Overview

   SYSLOG messages are translated to SNMP by a SYSLOG-to-SNMP
   translator.  Such a translator acts as a SYSLOG collector [RFC5424]
   and implements a MIB module according to the SNMP architecture
   [RFC3411].  The translator might be tightly coupled to an SNMP agent
   or it might interface with an SNMP agent via a subagent protocol.

   After initialization, the SYSLOG-to-SNMP translator will listen for

   SYSLOG messages.  On receiving a message, the message will be parsed
   to extract information as described in the MIB module.  A conceptual
   table is populated with information extracted from the SYSLOG message
   and finally a notification may be generated.

   The MIB module is organized into a group of scalars and two tables.
   The syslogMsgControl group contains two scalars controlling the
   maximum size of SYSLOG messages recorded in the tables and whether
   SNMP notifications are generated for SYSLOG messages.

   --syslogMsgObjects(1)
     |
     +--syslogMsgControl(1)
        |
        +-- Unsigned32 syslogMsgTableMaxSize(1)
        +-- TruthValue syslogMsgEnableNotifications(2)

   The syslogMsgTable contains one entry for each recorded SYSLOG
   message.  The basic fields of SYSLOG messages as well as message
   properties are represented in different columns of the conceptual
   table.

   --syslogMsgObjects(1)
     |
     +--syslogMsgTable(2)
        |
        +--syslogMsgEntry(1) [syslogMsgIndex]
           |
           +-- Unsigned32      syslogMsgIndex(1)
           +-- SyslogFacility  syslogMsgFacility(2)
           +-- SyslogSeverity  syslogMsgSeverity(3)
           +-- Unsigned32      syslogMsgVersion(4)
           +-- SyslogTimeStamp syslogMsgTimeStamp(5)
           +-- DisplayString   syslogMsgHostName(6)
           +-- DisplayString   syslogMsgAppName(7)
           +-- DisplayString   syslogMsgProcID(8)
           +-- DisplayString   syslogMsgMsgID(9)
           +-- Unsigned32      syslogMsgSDParams(10)
           +-- OctetString     syslogMsgMsg(11)

   The syslogMsgSDTable contains one entry for each structured data
   element parameter contained in a SYSLOG message.  Since structured
   data elements are optional, the relationship between the
   syslogMsgTable and the syslogMsgSDTable ranges from one-to-zero to
   one-to-many.

5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB [RFC3014] provides a generic mechanism for
   logging SNMP notifications in order to deal with lost SNMP
   notifications, e.g., due to transient communication problems.
   Applications can poll the notification log to verify that they have
   not missed important SNMP notifications.

   The MIB module defined in this memo provides a mechanism for logging
   SYSLOG notifications.  This additional SYSLOG notification log is
   provided because (a) SYSLOG messages might not lead to SNMP
   notification (this is configurable) and (b) SNMP notifications might
   not carry all information associated with a SYSLOG notification.

   The MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC
   [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411], and
   SYSLOG-TC-MIB [RFC5427].


6.  Relationship to the SNMP Notification to SYSLOG Mapping

   A companion document defines a mapping of SNMP notifications to
   SYSLOG messages [I-D.ietf-opsawg-syslog-snmp].  This section
   discusses the possibilities of using both specifications in
   combination.

   A SYSLOG collector implementing the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB module and the
   mapping of SNMP notifications to SYSLOG messages may be configured to
   translate received SYSLOG messages containing SNMP notifications back
   into the original SNMP notification.  In this case, the relevant
   tables of the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB will not be populated for SYSLOG
   messages carrying SNMP notifications.  This configuration allows
   operators to build a forwarding chain where SNMP notifications are



Schoenwaelder, et al.   Expires February 14, 2010               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               SYSLOG-MSG-MIB                  August 2009


   "tunneled" through SYSLOG messages.  Due to size restrictions of the
   SYSLOG transports and the more verbose textual encoding used by
   SYSLOG, there is a possibility that SNMP notification content gets
   truncated while tunneled through SYSLOG and thus the resulting SNMP
   notification may be incomplete.

   An SNMP management application supporting the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB and the
   mapping of SNMP notifications to SYSLOG messages may process
   information from the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB in order to emit a SYSLOG message
   representing the SYSLOG message recorded in the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB
   module.  This configuration allows operators to build a forwarding
   chain where SYSLOG messages are "tunneled" through SNMP messages.  A
   notification receiver can determine whether a syslogMsgNotification
   contained all structured data element parameters of a SYSLOG message.
   In case parameters are missing, a forwarding application MUST
   retrieve the missing parameters from the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB.  Regular
   polling of the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB can be used to take care of any lost
   SNMP notifications.

8.  Usage Example

   The following example shows a valid syslog message including
   structured data.  The otherwise-unprintable Unicode BOM is
   represented as "BOM" in the example.

    <165>1 2003-10-11T22:14:15.003Z mymachine.example.com
    evntslog - ID47 [exampleSDID@32473 iut="3" eventSource="Application"
    eventID="1011"] BOMAn application event log entry...

   This syslog message leads to the following entries in the
   syslogMsgTable and the syslogMsgSDTable (note that string indexes are
   written as strings for readability reasons):

     syslogMsgIndex.1 = 1
     syslogMsgFacility.1 = 20
     syslogMsgSeverity.1 = 5
     syslogMsgVersion.1 = 1
     syslogMsgTimeStamp.1 = 2003-10-11,22:14:15.003,+0:0
     syslogMsgHostName.1 = "mymachine.example.com"
     syslogMsgAppName.1 = "evntslog"
     syslogMsgProcID.1 = "-"
     syslogMsgMsgID.1 = "ID47"
     syslogMsgMsg.1 = "BOMAn application event log entry..."
     syslogMsgSDParamValue.1.1."exampleSDID@32473"."iut"
         = "3"
     syslogMsgSDParamValue.1.2."exampleSDID@32473"."eventSource"
         = "Application"
     syslogMsgSDParamValue.1.3."exampleSDID@32473"."eventID"
         = "1011"

9.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value.


10.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  syslogMsgTableMaxSize: This object controls how many entries are
      kept in the syslogMsgTable.  Unauthorized modifications may either
      cause increased memory consumption (by setting this object to a
      large value) or turn off the capability to retrieve notifications
      using GET class operations (by setting this object to zero).  This
      might be used to hide traces of an attack.
   o  syslogMsgEnableNotifications: This object enables notifications.
      Unauthorized modifications to disable notification generation can
      be used to hide an attack by preventing management applications
      that use SNMP from receiving real-time notifications about events
      carried in syslog messages.  Unauthorized modifications to enable
      notification generation may be used as part of a denial of service
      attack against a network management system if for example the
      SYSLOG-to-SNMP translator accepts unauthorized syslog messages.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  syslogMsgTableMaxSize, syslogMsgEnableNotifications: These objects
      provide information whether SYSLOG messages are forwarded as SNMP
      notifications and how many messages will be maintained in the
      syslogMsgTable.  This information might be exploited by an
      attacker in order to plan actions with the goal of hiding attack
      activities.

      syslogMsgSDParamValue: These objects carry the content of syslog
      messags and the syslog message oriented security considerations of
      [RFC5424] apply.  In particular, an attacker who gains access to
      SYSLOG messages via SNMP may use the knowledge gained from SYSLOG
      messages to compromise a machine or do other damage.  It is
      therefore desirable to configure SNMP access control rules
      enforcing a consistent security policy for SYSLOG messages.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   Using the security features of the SNMPv3 framework secures the
   transport of SYSLOG data via SNMP only.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED
   that deployments use SYSLOG security mechanisms in order to prevent
   attackers from adding malicious SYSLOG data to the MIB tables.

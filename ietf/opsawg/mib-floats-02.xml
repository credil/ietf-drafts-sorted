This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module
containing textual conventions (TCs) to represent 
floating-point numbers.

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>
	      This memo defines textual conventions for the representation
	      of floating-point numbers.
	      All of these definitions are in terms of the
	      IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic,
	      IEEE 754-2008 <xref target="IEEE.754.2008"></xref>.
      </t>

      <t>
The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic,
IEEE 754-2008 <xref target="IEEE.754.2008"></xref>,
provides for a variety of interchange formats for floating
point numbers.
The need for three of these, namely
        <list style="symbols">
	  <t>32-bit,</t>
	  <t>64-bit,</t>
	  <t>128-bit,</t>
        </list>
has been recognized in network management.
For example, Section 4.2.3 of the SMIng Objectives
<xref target="RFC3216"></xref>
elaborates the need for these three floating-point
data types in network management protocols.
      </t>
      <t>
The selection of a floating-point format involves many considerations
and trade-offs.
For an introduction to the fundamentals of floating-point representations
see chapter 4 of <xref target="KNUTH"></xref>, and for a
a discussion of these issues specifically with respect to the
IEEE formats, see <xref target="GOLDBERG"></xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        All of these textual conventions employ the binary interchange format
        defined in <xref target="IEEE.754.2008"></xref>.
        Specifically, this means that for all of them,
	the highest-order bit of the first byte is the sign bit,
        with the remaining bits of the octet string
        corresponding to the exponent and fraction parts,
        in network byte order.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework">
      <t>
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
Internet-Standard Management Framework,
please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>.
      </t>

      <t>
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined
in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is
compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"></xref>,
STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"></xref>
and STD 58, RFC 2580 <xref target="RFC2580"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability">
      <t>
The following list highlights some of the issues MIB designers
need to consider when deciding whether to employ these textual
conventions:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
Floating point numbers are useful if the number space
needs to cover a large dynamic range.
For number spaces with a limited range,
fixed point numbers can be more efficient and more precise.
          </t>
	  <t>
Floating point numbers are typically the wrong answer for data
that is truly decimal or can be handled adequately by re-thinking the
units and representing the scaled numbers as integers.
          </t> 
	  <t>
The SNMP "lexicographical" ordering for INDEX objects using these
floating point textual conventions will simply be that of the octet
strings corresponding to the floating point representations, which
will not always reflect the numerical ordering of the
corresponding floating point values.  Even if 
MIB designers take this into account, users might
still find the results of a MIB "walk" surprising.
Consequently, it is suggested that whenever one of these
textual conventions is used for an INDEX object, that
the DESCRIPTION clause should provide some warning.
          </t> 
	  <t>
Embedded systems sometimes lack floating point
support, which can complicate the implementation of MIB objects
using floating point numbers.
	  </t>
	  <t>
In choosing from among the types defined in this memo,
MIB designers need to consider both the range and
the precision needed, as well as recognize that
it could be inefficient to use, for example, 
Float128TC when Float64TC would do.
	  </t>
	  <t>
Since these textual conventions are defined
in terms of the OCTET STRING type, the SMI's mechanisms
for formally setting range constraints are not
available.  MIB designers using these textual
conventions will need to use DESCRIPTION clauses
to spell out any applicable range constraints beyond those
implied by the underlying IEEE types.
	  </t>
          <t>
	    Whenever these textual conventions are used in a MIB module,
	    the associated DESCRIPTION clause will need to
	    clearly specify whether denormalized numbers,
	    NaNs ("not a number") or infinities are permitted,
	    along with any special semantics associated  with these
            cases.  This is especially important for writeable objects.
          </t>

Editor's Note
(to be removed prior to publication):
the IANA is requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree
and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
"XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
remove this note.

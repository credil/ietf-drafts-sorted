		The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)
		</xref> specification defines a generic Distance Vector
		protocol that is adapted to a variety of Low Power and Lossy Networks
		(LLN) types by the application of specific Objective Functions (OFs).
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
		A RPL OF states the outcome of the process used by a RPL node to select 
		and optimize routes within a RPL Instance based on the information 
		objects available. As a general concept, an OF is not an algorithm.
		For example outside RPL, "shortest path first" is an OF where the least
		cost path between two points is derived as an outcome; there are a number
		of algorithms that can be used to satisfy the OF, of which the well-known
		Dijkstra algorithm is an example.

	  </t>
	  <t>
		The separation of OFs from the core protocol specification allows RPL
		to be adapted to meet the different optimization criteria required by
		the wide range of deployments, applications, and network designs.

	  </t>
	  <t>
		RPL forms Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as collections of Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs) 
		within instances of the protocol.
		Each instance is associated with a specialized Objective Function. A DODAG is periodically
		reconstructed as a new DODAG Version to enable a global reoptimization of the graph.</t>

	<t>
	<!-- An Objective Function selects the DODAG Version that a device joins within an instance,
	and a number of neighbor routers within that DODAG Version as parents or feasible successors.
    The OF generates the Rank of the device, that represents an abstract distance to the root within the DODAG.
	In turn, the Rank is used by the generic RPL core to avoid loops
	and verify forward progression towards a destination, as specified in
	-->
	An instance of RPL running on a device uses an Objective Function to
   help it determine which DODAG and which Version of that DODAG it should join. The OF is also
   used by the RPL instance to select a number of routers within the
   DODAG current and subsequent Versions to serve as parents or as feasible successors.</t>

	<t>

   The RPL instance uses the OF to compute a Rank for the device. This
   value represents an abstract distance to the root of the DODAG within
   the DODAG Version. The Rank is exchanged between nodes using RPL and
   allows other RPL nodes to avoid loops and verify forward progression
   toward the destination, as specified in	<xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>.
   Regardless of the particular OF used by a node, Rank will always
   increase and thus, post convergence, loop free paths are always
   formed.</t>

          <t> The Objective Function Zero (OF0) operates on parameters that are obtained from provisioning,
		  the RPL DODAG Configuration option and the RPL DIO base container
		  <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		  The Rank of a node is obtained by adding a stricly positive, indirectly normalized scalar, 
		  rank_increase (<xref target="vars"/>), to the Rank of a selected preferred parent. 
		  
		  The rank_increase is based on a step_of_rank (<xref target="vars"/>) normalized scalar that can vary with a ratio
		  from 1 (excellent) to 9 (worst acceptable) to represent the link properties. The step_of_rank
		  can be multiplied by a configurable factor called rank_factor (<xref target="parms"/>) that amplifies the rank_increase
		  to reflect the relative preferences between different link types that would be used in a same
		  RPL instance. The rank_increase can be further adapted as detailed in  <xref target="comprank" />.
		  <!--
		  Though a Rank value is represented as 2 octets, OF0 with default settings uses
		  increments of 0x100 so that the value can be stored in one octet, and
		  allows to encode a minimum of 28 hops and a maximum of 255 hops.
		  As a result,
		  OF0 with default settings allows to encode a minimum of 28 (worst acceptable) hops and a
		  maximum of 255 (excellent) hops. -->
		  By default, OF0 encodes the 2-octet Rank in units of 256, and the default settings allow to
		  encode a  minimum of 28 (worst acceptable) hops and a maximum of 255 (excellent) hops.

		  </t>
		  <!-- t>
		  How the link properties are transformed into a step_of_rank for a given hop
		  depends on the link type and on the implementation. It can be as simple as an administrative cost,
		  but might also derive from a statistical metric with some hysteresis.</t -->
 
 <t> <!--  It is important that devices deployed in a particular network or
   environment use the same OF to build and operate DODAGs. If they do
   not, it is likely that sub-optimal paths will be selected. In
   practice, without a common definition of an OF, RPL implementations
   cannot guarantee to interoperate correctly. -->
      The RPL specification	
     <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> requires the use of a common OF by all nodes
     in a network. The possible use of multiple OFs with a single network
    is for further study.  </t>
	  <t> The RPL specification	 <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>
	 does not include any OF
     definitions. This is left for other documents specific to different
     deployments and application environments. Since there is no default OF or metric container in the RPL main specification, it might
	happen that, unless two given implementations follow the same guidance for a specific problem
	or environment, those implementations will not support a common OF with which they could interoperate.
	  </t>
		  <t>OF0 is designed as a default OF that will allow interoperation between implementations in a wide spectrum of use cases.
	<!-- that are not specifically designed to
	apply to a given case for which further guidance is provided. -->
	This is why OF0 does not specify how the link properties are transformed into a rank_increase
	and leaves that responsibility to the implementation;
	rather, OF0 enforces the values for the rank_increase by normalizing the step_of_rank for
	a normal link and its acceptable range, as opposed to formulating the details of the step_of_rank computation.
	This is also why OF0 ignores metric containers.
    </t>

   <!-- t>
    Indeed, it is the general design in RPL that the metrics are passed from parent to children in
	a specific container and that the OF will derive the Rank from the natural metric.
	The separation of Rank and metrics avoids a loss of information as the various metrics are propagated down the DAG.

	This specification can be used when the link properties that are considered are
	such that they can be turned in a scalar step_of_rank in a reversible fashion and the resulting
	step_of_rank is additive over multiple hops. </t -->

<!--
    <section title="Objective Functions">
          <t>An Objective Function (OF) allows for the selection of a DAG to
          join, and a number of peers in that DAG as parents. The OF is used
          to compute an ordered list of parents and provides load balancing
          guidance. The OF is also responsible to compute the Rank of the
          device within the DAG.</t>

		  <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> defines the operation of RPL
		  and the generic interfaces that all OFs need to implement. OF0
		  does not require additional headers and is implemented using
		  only the information in the DIO Base.</t>

          <t>The Objective Function is specified in the RA-DIO message using
          an objective code point (OCP) and indicates the objective function
          that has been used to compute the DAG (e.g. "minimize the path cost
          using the ETX metric and avoid `Blue' links"). The objective code
          points are specified in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics" />. This document specifies
          the OCP 0, in support of default operation.</t>

          <t>OFO follows the same abstract behavior specified in < xref
          target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl" />: </t>

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>The parent selection is triggered each time an event indicates
            that a potential next_hop information is updated. This might
            happen upon the reception of a RA-DIO message, a timer elapse, or
            a trigger indicating that the state of a candidate neighbor has
            changed.</t>

            <t>An OF scans all the interfaces on the device. Although there
            may typically be only one interface in most application scenarios,
            there might be multiple of them and an interface might be
            configured to be usable or not for RPL operation. An interface can
            also be configured with a preference or dynamically learned to be
            better than another by some heuristics that might be link-layer
            dependent and are out of scope. Finally an interface might or not
            match a required criterion for an Objective Function, for instance
            a degree of security. As a result some interfaces might be
            completely excluded from the computation, while others might be
            more or less preferred.</t>

            <t>The OF scans all the candidate neighbors on the possible
            interfaces to check whether they can act as an attachment router
            for a DAG. There might be multiple of them and a candidate
            neighbor might need to pass some validation tests before it can be
            used. In particular, some link layers require experience on the
            activity with a router to enable the router as a next_hop.</t>

            <t>The OF computes self's Rank by adding the step_of_rank to that
            candidate to the Rank of that candidate. The step_of_rank is

          allowed, then the RA-DIO message is simply ignored and not processed
          by the node.</t>

		  -->
          <section anchor="ovv" title="Objective Function Zero Overview">

		  <t>The RPL specification describes constraints on how nodes select
    		potential parents, called a parent set, from their neighbors.
			All parents are feasible successors for upward traffic (towards
			the root). Additionally, RPL allows the use of parents in a
			subsequent Version of a same DODAG as feasible successors, in which
			case this node acts as a leaf in the subsequent DODAG Version.
			<!--
			Further specifications might extend the set of feasible successors,
			for instance to nodes of a same Rank, aka siblings.  <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>
			-->
		</t>

		    <t> The Goal of the OF0 is for a node to join a DODAG Version that
			offers good enough connectivity to a specific set of nodes or to
			a larger routing infrastructure though there is no guarantee
			that the path will be optimized according to a specific metric.  
			This validation process for the connectivity is implementation and
			link type dependent, and is out of scope.  The validation involves
			but is not limited to application of <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>
			sections 3.2.3 and 13 as appropriate, and may involve deployment specific policies
			as well. 
	        Thus, for the purpose of OF0, the term Grounded <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>
			means that the DODAG root provides such connectivity. How that connectivity is asserted
			and maintained is out of scope.</t>

            <t>Objective Function Zero is designed to find the nearest Grounded
			root.  
			This can be achieved if the Rank of a node is very close to an
			abstract function of its distance to the root.
            This need is balanced with the other need of maintaining some path diversity,
			which may be achieved by increasing the Rank.
			In the absence of a Grounded root, inner connectivity within the LLN
			is still desirable and floating DAGs will form, rooted at the
			nodes with the highest administrative preference.</t>

			<t>OF0 selects a preferred parent and a backup feasible successor if one is
            available. All the upward traffic is normally routed via the preferred parent
			with no attempt to perform any load balancing.
			When the link conditions do not let an upward packet through the preferred parent,
            the packet is passed to the backup feasible successor.</t>

			 <t>A RPL node monitors links to a number of neighbor nodes, and can use OF0 to
			assign a rank_increase to each link.
			Though the exact method for computing the rank_increase is implementation-dependent,
			the computation must follow the rules that are specified in <xref target="comprank"/>.
				</t>
            </section>

          <section title="OF0 Operations">

          <section anchor="comprank" title="Computing Rank">
			<t>An OF0 implementation first computes a variable step_of_rank 
			(<xref target="vars"/>) associated with a
			given parent from relevant link properties and metrics. The
			step_of_rank is used to compute the amount by which to increase the
			rank along a particular link, as explained later in this section.
			</t>

			<t>Computing a step_of_rank based on a static metric such as an
			administrative cost implies that the OF0 implementation
			only considers parents with good enough connectivity, <!--for instance
			neighbors that are reachable over an Ethernet link, or a WIFI link in
			infrastructure mode, -->and results in a Rank that is analogous to hop-count.
	        In most LLNs, this favors paths with fewer but longer hops of poorer connectivity;
			it is thus RECOMMENDED to base the computation of the step_of_rank
			on dynamic link properties such as the expected transmission count metric (ETX)
			as introduced in <xref target="DeCouto03"/> and discussed in 
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics"/>. The
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-minrank-hysteresis-of">
		    Minimum Rank Objective Function with Hysteresis </xref>
			provides guidance on how link cost can be computed and on how
			hysteresis can improve Rank stability.</t>


			<t>OF0 allows an implementation to stretch the step_of_rank in order to enable
			the selection of at least one feasible successor and thus maintain path diversity.
			Stretching the step_of_rank is NOT RECOMMENDED, because it augments the apparent
			distance from the node to the root, distorts the DODAG from the optimal
			shape and may cause instabilities due to greedy behaviors whereby
			depending nodes augment their Ranks to use each other as parents in a loop.
			Still, an implementation may stretch the step_of_rank with at most a configurable 
			stretch_of_rank (<xref target="parms"/>) of any value between 0 (no stretch) and 
			the fixed constant MAXIMUM_RANK_STRETCH (<xref target="consts"/>).</t>


			<t>An implementation MUST maintain the stretched step_of_rank between
			the fixed constants MINIMUM_STEP_OF_RANK and
			MAXIMUM_STEP_OF_RANK (<xref target="consts"/>). This range allows to reflect a
			large variation of link quality.</t>


			<t>The gap between MINIMUM_STEP_OF_RANK and MAXIMUM_RANK_STRETCH
			may not be sufficient in every case to strongly distinguish links of different
			types or categories in order to favor, say, powered over battery-operated or 
			high-speed (wired) over lower-speed (wireless) links, within a same DAG. An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to configure a factor
			called rank_factor (<xref target="parms"/>) and to apply the factor on all links 
			and peers to multiply the effect of the stretched step_of_rank in the rank_increase 
			computation as further detailed below.
			</t>

			<t>Additionally, an implementation MAY recognize categories of peers and links,
			such as different link types, in which case it SHOULD be able to configure a more
			specific rank_factor to those categories.
			The rank_factor MUST be set between the fixed constants 
			MINIMUM_RANK_FACTOR and MAXIMUM_RANK_FACTOR (<xref target="consts"/>) .
			</t>
		    <t>The variable rank_increase is represented in units expressed by the variable
			MinHopRankIncrease which defaults to the fixed constant
			DEFAULT_MIN_HOP_RANK_INCREASE (<xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>); with that setting,
			the least significant octet in the RPL Rank field in the DIO Base
			Object is not used.
			 </t>
			<t>The step_of_rank Sp that is computed for that link is multiplied by the
			rank_factor Rf and then possibly stretched by a term Sr that is less than or equal to
			the configured stretch_of_rank.
			The resulting rank_increase is added
			to the Rank of preferred parent R(P) to obtain that of this node R(N):
			</t>
			<t> R(N) = R(P) + rank_increase where: </t>
			<t> rank_increase = (Rf*Sp + Sr) * MinHopRankIncrease
			</t>

			<t>Optionally, the administrative preference of a root MAY be configured

          <section title="Selection Of The Preferred Parent">
            <t>As it scans all the candidate neighbors, OF0 keeps the parent that is
				the best for the following criteria (in order):
			<list style="numbers">

                <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> section 8 spells out the generic
				rules for a node to re-parent and in particular the boundaries
				to augment its Rank within a DODAG Version.
				A candidate that would not satisfy those rules MUST NOT be considered.</t>

				<t>An implementation SHOULD validate a router prior to selecting it
				as preferred as discussed in <xref target="ovv"/>. The validation involves
				layer 2 connectivity to the router, layer 3 connectivity offered by the router, 
				and may involve other factors such as policies.
				In most cases, a router that does not succeed the validation process
				cannot be further considered for selection as preferred parent. In any case
				a router that succeeded that validation process SHOULD be preferred.</t>

				<t>When multiple interfaces are available,
				a policy might be locally configured to order them and that
				policy applies first;
				that is a router on a higher order interface in the policy
				is preferable.</t>

				<t>If the administrative preference of the root is configured to
				supersede the goal to join a Grounded DODAG,
				a router that offers connectivity to a more preferable root SHOULD be
                preferred.</t>

                <t>A router that offers connectivity to a grounded DODAG Version SHOULD be
                preferred over one that does not.</t>

				<t>A router that offers connectivity to a more preferable root SHOULD be
                preferred.</t>

                <t>When comparing 2 parents that belong to the same DODAG, a router that
				offers connectivity to the most recent DODAG Version SHOULD be preferred.</t>

                <t>The parent that causes the lesser resulting Rank
				for this node, as specified in <xref target="comprank"/>,
				SHOULD be preferred.</t>

                <t>A DODAG Version for which there is an alternate parent SHOULD be preferred.
                This check is OPTIONAL. It is performed by computing the
                backup feasible successor while assuming that the router that is currently examined
				is finally selected as preferred parent.</t>

                <!-- t>The DODAG Version that was in use already SHOULD be preferred.</t -->

                <t>The preferred parent that was in use already SHOULD be preferred.</t>

                <t>A router that has announced a DIO message more recently SHOULD be preferred.</t>

              <t>The backup feasible successor MUST NOT be the preferred parent.</t>

              <t>
			  The backup feasible successor MUST be either in the same DODAG Version as
			  this node or in an subsequent DODAG Version.</t>

              <t>Along with RPL rules, a Router in the same DODAG Version as
			  this node and with a Rank that is higher than the Rank
			  computed for this node MUST NOT be selected as a feasible successor.
			    <!--
			  Further specifications might allow a node of a same Rank as a feasible successor.
			Further specifications might extend the set of feasible successors,
			for instance to nodes of a same Rank, aka siblings.It MAY still be selected as sibling if no better Back-up next hop is found. -->
			  </t>

              <t>A router with a lesser Rank SHOULD be preferred.</t>

              <t>A router that has been validated as usable by an implementation-dependant
			  validation process SHOULD be preferred.</t>
			  
			  <t>When multiple interfaces are available,

	<t>Section 18 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> depicts the management of the protocol.
	This specification inherits from that section and its subsections, with the exception that metrics

	management.
	</t>
	
    <section anchor="mgtp" title="Device Configuration">
	
	<t>An implementation SHOULD allow to configure at least a global rank_factor that applies

	neighbors and configure a more specific rank_factor to such groups.
	</t>
	
	<t>An implementation MAY allow to configure a maximum stretch_of_rank as discussed in  
	<xref target="comprank"/>. If none is configured, a value of 0 is assumed and the step_of_rank
	is not stretched.
	</t>
	
	<t>An OF0 implementation SHOULD support the DODAG Configuration option as specified in

	As discussed in section 16 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>, this requirement might be
	overridden by further guidance for certain application scenarios.
	When the option is used, the parameters are configured to the nodes that may become DODAG roots,
	and the nodes are configured to redistribute the information using the DODAG Configuration option.
    In particular, the value of MinHopRankIncrease can be distributed with that option and override
	the fixed constant of DEFAULT_MIN_HOP_RANK_INCREASE that is defined section 17 of
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> with a fixed value of 256. 
	</t>
	
	<t>Out of the box, that is at initial factory time, the default constant values SHOULD be used, that is:

	 <t>the maximum stretch_of_rank is set to the fixed constant

    <section anchor="Sec" title="Security Considerations">
	<t>
	   This specification makes simple extensions to RPL and so is 
   vulnerable to and benefits from the security issues and mechanisms
   described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> and 
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-security-framework"/>.  This
   document does not introduce new flows or new messages, thus requires
   no specific mitigation for new threats.	</t>
	<t>
   OF0 depends on information exchanged in the Rank and OCP protocol 
   elements. If those elements were compromised, then an implementation
   of OF0 might generate the wrong path for a packet, resulting in it 
   being misrouted. Therefore, deployments are RECOMMENDED to use RPL
   security mechanisms if there is a risk that routing information might
   be modified or spoofed.	</t>

	<!--t>
	This specification inherits from <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> for its messages and
	security mechanisms. Section 19 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> provides Security 
	Considerations that are valid for both documents. This document does not introduce new flows 
	or new messages, thus requires no specific mitigation for new threats.

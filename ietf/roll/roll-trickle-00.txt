                         The Trickle Algorithm
                      draft-levis-roll-trickle-00

Abstract

   The Trickle algorithm allows wireless nodes to exchange information
   in a highly robust, energy efficient, simple, and scalable manner.
   Dynamically adjusting transmission windows allows Trickle to spread
   new information on the scale of link-layer transmission times while
   sending only a few messages per hour when information does not
   change.  A simple suppression nechanism and transmission point
   selection allows Trickle's communication rate to scale
   logarithmically with density.  This document describes Trickle and
   considerations in its use.

1.  Introduction

   The Trickle algorithm is designed for wireless networks.  It
   establishes a density-aware local broadcast with an underlying
   consistency model that guides when a node communicates.  When a
   node's data does not agree with its neighbors, it communicates
   quickly to resolve the inconsistency.  When nodes agree, they slow
   their communicationrate exponentially, such that in a stable state
   nodes send at most a few packets per hour.  Instead of flooding a
   network with packets, the algorithm controls the send rate so each
   node hears a small trickle of packets, just enough to stay
   consistent.  Furthermore, by relying only on local broadcasts,
   Trickle handles network re-population, is robust to network
   transience, loss, and disconnection, and requires very little state
   (implementations use 4-11 bytes).

   While Trickle was originally designed for reprogramming protocols
   (where the data is the code of the program being updated), experience
   has shown it to be a powerful mechanism that can be applied to wide
   range of protocol design problems.  For example, routing protocols
   such as RPL use Trickle to ensure that nodes in a given neighborhood
   have consistent, loop-free routes.  When the topology is consistent,
   nodes occasionally gossip to check that they still agree, and when
   the topology changes they gossip more frequently, until they reach
   consistency again.

   This document describes the Trickle algorithm and provides guidelines
   for its use.  It also states requirements for protocol specifications
   that use Trickle.  This document does not provide results on
   Trickle's performance or behavior, nor does it explain the
   algorithm's design in detail: interested readers should refer to
   [Levis08].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Trickle Algorithm Overview

   Trickle's basic primitive is simple: every so often, a mote transmits
   code metadata if it has not heard a few other motes transmit the same
   thing.  This allows Trickle to scale to thousand-fold variations in
   network density, quickly propagate updates, distribute transmission

   load evenly, be robust to transient disconnections, handle network
   repopulations, and impose a maintenance overhead on the order of a
   few packets per hour.

   Trickle sends all messages to the local broadcast address.  There are
   two possible results to a Trickle broadcast: either every mote that
   hears the message is up to date, or a recipient detects the need for
   an update.  Detection can be the result of either an out-of-date mote
   hearing someone has new code, or an updated mote hearing someone has
   old code.  As long as every mote communicates somehow - either
   receives or transmits - the need for an update will be detected.

   For example, consider a simple case where "up to date" is defined by
   version numbers (e.g., network configuration).  If node A broadcasts
   that it has version V, but B has version V+1, then B knows that A
   needs an update.  Similarly, if B broadcasts that it has V+1, A knows
   that it needs an update.  If B broadcasts updates, then all of its
   neighbors can receive them without having to advertise their need.
   Some of these recipients might not even have heard A's transmission.

   In this example, it does not matter who first transmits, A or B;
   either case will detect the inconsistency.  All that matters is that
   some nodes communicate with one another at some nonzero rate.  As
   long as the network is connected and there is some minimum
   communication rate for each node, the network will reach eventual
   consistency.

   The fact that communication can be either transmission or reception
   enables Trickle to operate in sparse as well as dense networks.  A
   single, disconnected node must transmit at the communication rate.
   In a lossless, single-hop network of size n, the sum of transmissions
   over the network is the communication rate, so for each node it is
   1/n.  Sparser networks require more transmissions per mote, but
   utilization of the radio channel over space will not increase.  This
   is an important property in wireless networks, where the channel is a
   valuable shared resource.  Additionally, reducing transmissions in
   dense networks conserves system energy.


4.  Trickle Algorithm

   This section describes the Trickle algorithm.

4.1.  Parameters and Variables

   A Trickle timer has three configuration parameters: the minimum
   interval size Imin, the maximum interval size Imax, and a redundancy
   constant k:



Levis & Clausen          Expires August 29, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         draft-levis-roll-trickle-00         February 2010


   o  The minimum interval size is defined in units of time (e.g.,
      milliseconds, seconds).  For example, a protocol might define the
      minimum interval as 100 milliseconds.

   o  The maximum interval size is described as a number of doublings of
      the minimum interval size (the base-2 log(max/min)).  For example,
      a protocol might define the maximum interval as 16.  If the
      minimum interval is 100ms, then the maximum interval is 100ms *
      65536, 6,553.6 seconds, or approximately 109 minutes.

   o  The redundancy constant is a natural number (an integer greater
      than zero).

   In addition to these three parameters, Trickle maintains three
   variables:

   o  I, the current interval size

   o  t, a time within the current interval, and

   o  c, a counter.

4.2.  Algorithm Description

   The Trickle algorithm has five rules:

   1.  When an interval begins, Trickle resets c to 0 and sets t to a
       random point in the interval, taken from the range [I/2, I).

   2.  Whenever Trickle hears a transmission that is "consistent," it
       increments counter c.

   3.  At time t, Trickle transmits if and only if counter c is less
       than the redundancy constant k.

   4.  When an interval expires, Trickle doubles the interval length.
       If this new interval length would be longer than Imax, Trickle
       sets the interval length I to be Imax.

   5.  If Trickle hears a transmission that is "inconsistent" and I is
       greater than Imin, Trickle resets I to Imin, and begins a new
       interval.

   The terms consistent and inconsistent are in quotes because their
   meaning depends on the use of Trickle.

5.  Using Trickle

   A protocol specification that uses Trickle should specify:

   o  Default values for Imin, Imax, and k.  Because link layers can
      vary widely in their properties, the default value of Imin should
      be specified in terms of the worst-case latency of a link layer
      transmission.  For example, a specification should say "the
      default value of Imin is 4 times the worst case link layer
      latency" and should not say "the default value of Imin is 500
      milliseconds."  Worst case latency is the time until the first
      link-layer transmission of the frame assuming an idle channel
      (does not include backoff, virtual carrier sense, etc.).

   o  What constitutes a "consistent" transmission.

   o  What constitutes an "inconsistent" transmission.


6.  Operational Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that a protocol which uses Trickle include
   mechanisms to inform nodes of configuration parameters at runtime.
   However, it is not always possible to do so.  In the cases where
   different nodes have different configuration parameters, Trickle may
   have unintended behaviors.  This section outlines some of those
   behaviors as an educational exercise.

6.1.  Mismatched redundancy constants

   If nodes do not agree on the redundancy constant k, then nodes with
   higher values of k will transmit more often than nodes with lower
   values of k.  In some cases, this increased load can be independent
   of the density.  For example, consider a network where all nodes but
   one have k=1, and this one node has k=2.  The different node can end
   up transmitting on every interval: it is maintaining a communication
   rate of 2 with only itself.  Hence, the danger of mismatched k values
   is uneven transmission load that can deplete the energy of some
   nodes.

6.2.  Mismatched Imin

   If nodes do not agree on Imin, then some nodes, on hearing
   inconsistent messages, will transmit sooner than others.  These
   faster nodes will have their intervals grow to similar size as the
   slower nodes within a single slow interval time, but in that period
   may suppress the slower nodes.  However, such suppression will end
   after the first slow interval, when the nodes generally agree on the

Internet-Draft         draft-levis-roll-trickle-00         February 2010


   interval size.  Hence, mismatched Imin values are usually not a
   significant concern.

6.3.  Mismatched Imax

   If nodes do not agree on Imax, then this can cause long-term problems
   with transmission load.  Nodes with small Imax values will transmit
   faster, suppressing those with larger Imax values.  The nodes will
   larger Imax values, always suppressed, will never transmit.  In the
   base case, when the network is consistent, this can cause long-term
   inequities in energy cost.

6.4.  Mismatched definitions

   If nodes do not agree on what constitutes a consistent or
   inconsistent transmission, then Trickle may fail to operate properly.
   For example, if a receiver thinks a transmission is consistent, but
   the transmitter (if in the receivers situation) would have thought it
   inconsistent, then the receiver will not respond properly and inform
   the transmitter.  This can lead the network to not reach a consistent
   state.  For this reason, unlike the configuration constants k, Imin,
   and Imax, consistency definitions should be clearly stated in the
   protocol and should not be configured at runtime.

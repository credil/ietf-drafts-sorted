    <abstract>
        <t>The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)
        uses objective functions to construct routes that optimize or
        constrain the routes it selects and uses. This specification
        describes the Minimum Rank Objective Function with Hysteresis
        (MRHOF), an objective function that selects routes that
        minimize a metric, while using hysteresis to reduce churn in
        response to small metric changes. MRHOF works with metrics
        that are additive along a route, and the metric it uses is
        determined by the metrics RPL Destination Information Object
        (DIO) messages advertise.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>An objective function specifies how RPL <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref> selects paths.  Objective
      functions can choose paths based on routing metrics or
      constraints. For example, if an RPL instance uses an objective
      function that minimizes hop-count, RPL will select paths with
      minimum hop count.</t>

      <t>The nodes running RPL might use a number of metrics to
      describe a link or a
      node <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics"></xref> and
      make it available for route selection. These metrics are
      advertised in RPL Destination Information Object (DIO) messages
      using a Metric Container suboption. An objective function can
      use these metrics to choose routes. The only exception is the
      ETX metric, which is used without the metric container as
      described in <xref target="No Container"></xref>.</t>

      <t>To decouple the details of an individual metric or objective
      function from forwarding and routing, RPL describes routes
      through a value called Rank. Rank, roughly speaking, corresponds
      to the distance associated with a route. An objective function
      is responsible for computing a node's advertised Rank value
      based on the Rank of its potential parents, metrics, and other
      network properties.</t>


      <t>This specification describes MRHOF, an objective function for
      RPL. MRHOF uses hysteresis while selecting the path with the
      smallest metric value. The metric that MRHOF uses is determined
      by the metrics in the DIO Metric Container. For example, the use
      of MRHOF with the latency metric allows RPL to find stable
      minimum-latency paths from the nodes to a root in the DAG
      instance. The use of MRHOF with the ETX metric allows RPL to
      find the stable minimum-ETX paths from the nodes to a root in
      the DAG instance.</t>

      <t>MRHOF can only be used with an additive metric that must be
      minimized on the paths selected for routing.</t>

    <section title="The Minimum Rank Objective Function with Hysteresis">

      <t>The Minimum Rank Objective Function with Hysteresis, MRHOF,
      is designed to find the paths with the smallest path cost while
      preventing excessive churn in the network. It does so by finding
      the minimum cost path and switching to that path only if it is
      shorter (in terms of path cost) than the current path by at
      least a given threshold. MRHOF may be used with any additive
      metric listed
      in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics"></xref> as long
      the routing objective is to minimize the given routing
      metric.</t>

      <section title="Computing the Path cost">
	
	<t>Nodes compute the path cost for each candidate neighbor
	  reachable on an interface. The Path cost represents
	  the cost of the path, in terms of the selected metric,
	  from a node to the root of the DODAG through the
	  neighbor. </t>
	
	<t>Root nodes (Grounded or Floating) set the variable
	  cur_min_path_cost to MIN_PATH_COST.</t>
	
	<t>A non-root node computes the path cost for a path to the
	  root through each candidate neighbor by adding these two
	  components:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	    <t> If the selected metric is a link metric, the selected
	    metric for the link to a candidate neighbor.  If the
	    selected metric is a node metric, the selected metric for
	    the node.</t>
	    <t> The value of the selected metric in the metric
	    container in the DIO sent by that neighbor.</t>
	  </list></t>

	  <t>A node SHOULD compute the path cost for the path through
	  each candidate neighbor reachable through an
	  interface. If a node cannot compute the path cost for the
	  path through a candidate neighbor, the node MUST NOT select
	  the candidate neighbor as its preferred parent, with one
	  exception. If the node does not have metrics to compute the
	  path cost through any of the candidate neighbors, it MUST
	  join one of the candidate neighbors as a leaf node.</t>

	  <t>If the selected metric is a link metric and the metric of
	    the link to a neighbor is not available, the path cost for
	    the path through that neighbor SHOULD be set to
	    MAX_PATH_COST. This cost value will prevent this path from
	    being considered for path selection.</t>

	  <t>If the selected metric is a node metric, and the metric
	  is not available, the path cost through all the neighbors
	  SHOULD be set to MAX_PATH_COST.</t>


	<t>The path cost corresponding to a neighbor SHOULD be
	re-computed each time:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	  <t>The selected metric of the link to the candidate neighbor is
	  updated.</t>
	  <t>If the selected metric is a node metric and the metric is
	  updated.</t>
	  <t>A node receives a new metric advertisement from the
	  candidate neighbor.</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>This computation MAY also be performed periodically. Too
	much delay in updating the path cost after the metric is
	updated or a new metric advertisement is received can lead to
	stale Rank or parent set.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Parent Selection">

	<t>After computing the path cost for all the candidate
	neighbors reachable through an interface for the current
	DODAG iteration, a node selects the preferred parent. This
	process is called parent selection. Parent Selection SHOULD be
	performed each time:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	  <t>The path cost for an existing candidate neighbor,
	  including the preferred parent, changes. This condition can
	  be checked immediately after the path cost is computed.</t>
	  <t>A new candidate neighbor is inserted into the neighbor
	  table.</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>The parent selection MAY be deferred until a later
	time. Deferring the parent selection can delay the use of
	better paths available in the network.</t>

	<t>A node MUST select a candidate neighbor as its preferred
	parent if the path cost corresponding to that neighbor
	is smaller than the path cost corresponding to the rest
	of the neighbors, except as indicated below:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">

	  <t>If the smallest path cost for paths through the
	    candidate neighbors is smaller than cur_min_path_cost by
	    less than PARENT_SWITCH_THRESHOLD, the node MAY continue
	    to use the current preferred parent.</t>

	  <t>If there are multiple paths with the smallest path cost
	    and the smallest path cost is smaller than
	    cur_min_path_cost by at least PARENT_SWITCH_THRESHOLD, a
	    node MAY use a different objective function to select the
	    preferred parent among the candidate neighbors on the path
	    with the minimum cost.</t>

	  <t>A node MAY declare itself as a Floating root, and hence
	    no preferred parent, depending on the configuration.</t>

	  <t>If the selected metric for a link is greater than
	    MAX_LINK_METRIC, the node SHOULD exclude that link
	    from consideration for parent selection.</t>

	  <t>If cur_min_path_cost is greater than MAX_PATH_COST,
	    the node MAY declare itself as a Floating root.</t>

	  <t>If ALLOW_FLOATING_ROOT is 0 and no neighbors are
	    discovered, the node does not have a preferred parent, and
	    MUST set cur_min_path_cost to MAX_PATH_COST.</t>


	</list></t>


	<t>Except in the cases above, the candidate neighbor on the
	  path with the smallest path cost is the preferred parent. A
	  node MAY include a total of PARENT_SET_SIZE candidate
	  neighbors in the parent set. The cost of path through the
	  nodes in the parent set is smaller than or equal to the cost
	  of the paths through any of the nodes that are not in the
	  parent set. If the cost of the path through the preferred
	  parent and the worst parent is too large, a node MAY keep a
	  smaller parent set.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Computing Rank">

	<t>The DAG roots set their rank to MIN_PATH_COST for the
	selected metric.</t>

	<t>Once a non-root node selects its parent set, it can use the
	  following table to covert the path cost of the worst
	  parent (written as Cost in the table) to its rank:</t>

	<texttable anchor="costrank" title="Conversion of metric to rank.">
	    <ttcol align='center'>Node/link Metric</ttcol>
	    <ttcol align='center'>Rank</ttcol>
	    <c>Node Energy</c><c>255 - Cost</c>
	    <c>Hop-Count</c><c>Cost</c>
	    <c>Latency</c><c>Cost/65536</c>
	    <c>Link Quality Level</c><c>Cost</c>
	    <c>ETX</c><c>Cost</c>
	  </texttable>

	    <t>Nodes MUST support at least one of the above
	    metrics. Nodes SHOULD support the ETX metric.</t>

	    <t>Node rank is undefined for these node/link metrics:
	    Node state and attributes, throughput, and link color. If
	    the rank is undefined, the node must join one of the
	    neighbors as a leaf node according
	    to <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Advertising the Path Cost">
	<t>Once the preferred parent is selected, the node sets its
	cur_min_path_cost variable to the path cost corresponding to
	the preferred parent. Thus, cur_min_path_cost is the cost of
	the minimum cost path from the node to the root. The value of
	the cur_min_path_cost is carried in the metric container
	corresponding to the selected metric when DIO messages are
	sent.</t>

	<t>If ETX is the selected metric, cur_min_path_cost is
	directly used as Rank and never advertised in a metric
	container.</t>
      </section>


      <section anchor="No Container" title="Working Without Metric Containers">

	<t>In the absence of metric container, MRHOF uses ETX as its
	metric. It locally computes the ETX of links to its neighbors
	and adds this value to their advertised Rank to compute the
	associated Rank of routes.  Once parent selection and rank
	computation is performed using the ETX metric, the node
	advertises a Rank equal to the ETX cost and MUST NOT include
	a metric container in its DIO messages.</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Using MRHOF for Metric Maximization">
      <t>MRHOF cannot be directly used for parent selection using
      metrics which require finding paths with maximum value of the
      selected metric, such as path reliability. It is possible to
      convert such a metric maximization problem to a metric
      minimization problem for some metrics and use MRHOF
      provided:</t>

      <t><list>
	  <t>There is a fixed and well-known maximum metric value
	  corresponding to the best path. This is the path cost for
	  the DAG root. For example, the logarithm of the best link
	  reliability has a value of 0.</t>
	  <t>The metrics in the maximization problem are all
	  negative. The logarithm of the link reliability is always
	  negative.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>For metrics meeting the above conditions, the problem of
      maximizing the metric value is equivalent to minimizing the
      modified metric value, e.g., logarithm of link
      reliability. MRHOF is not required to work with these
      metrics.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="MRHOF Variables and Parameters">
      
      <t>MRHOF uses the following variable:</t>

      <t><list>
	<t>cur_min_path_cost: The cost of the path from a node
	through its preferred parent to the root computed at the last
	parent selection.</t>
      </list></t>


      <t>MRHOF uses the following parameters:</t>

      <t><list>
	<t>MAX_LINK_METRIC: Maximum allowed value for the
	selected link metric for each link on the path.</t>

	<t>MAX_PATH_COST: Maximum allowed value for the path
	metric of a selected path.</t>

	<t>MIN_PATH_COST: The minimum allowed value for the
	path metric of the selected path.</t>

	<t>PARENT_SWITCH_THRESHOLD: The difference between metric of
	   the path through the preferred parent and the minimum-metric
	   path in order to trigger the selection of a new preferred parent.</t>
	
	<t>PARENT_SET_SIZE: The number of candidate parents, including
	the preferred parent, in the parent set.</t>

	<t>ALLOW_FLOATING_ROOT: If set to 1, allows a node to become a
	floating root.</t>


      </list></t>

	<t>The parameter values are assigned depending on the selected
	metric. The best values for these parameters should
	be experimentally determined. The working group has long
	experience routing with the ETX metric. Based on those
	experiences, these values are RECOMMENDED:</t>

	<t><list>

	    <t>MAX_LINK_METRIC: 10. Disallow links with greater
	    than 10 expected transmission count on the selected
	    path.</t>

	    <t>MAX_PATH_COST: 100. Disallow paths with greater
	    than 100 expected transmission count.</t>

	    <t>MIN_PATH_COST: 0. At root, the expected
	    transmission count is 0.</t>

	    <t>PARENT_SWITCH_THRESHOLD: 1.5. Switch to a new path only
	    if it is expected to require at least 1.5 fewer
	    transmission than the current path.</t>

	    <t>PARENT_SET_SIZE: 3. If the preferred parent is not
	    available, two candidate parents are still available
	    without triggering a new round of route discovery.</t>

	    <t>ALLOW_FLOATING_ROOT: 0. Do not allow a node to become a
	    floating root.</t>

	    </list></t>

	<section anchor="Manageability" title="Manageability">
	  <t> The parameters MAX_LINK_METRIC, MAX_PATH_COST,
	  MIN_PATH_COST, PARENT_SWITCH_THRESHOLD, PARENT_SET_SIZE, and

          The Kerberos 5 KRB-CRED message is used to transfer Kerberos credentials between
          applications.
          When used with a secure transport the unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED message may be desirable.
          This document describes the unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED message.

        <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
        There are applications which need to transfer Kerberos credentials between
        them without having a prior relationship with established Kerberos keys.
        When tranferred over a transport that provides confidentiality and integrity the unencrypted form
        of the KRB-CRED message MAY be used.
        One application employing this method is the <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os">Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0</xref> attribute transport.
        </t>
        <t>
        In the SAML application, the Identity Provider (IdP) somehow obtains a
        Kerberos service ticket from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
        when required by the SAML system
        and transfers the credential to a Service Provider (SP)
        within an attribute statement.
        The SP can then use the credential to access a Kerberos protected service. 
        </t>
        <t>
        The Kerberos 5 specification as described in <xref target="RFC4120"/> mentions the
        non-standard legacy use of unencypted KRB-CRED with 
        Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) <xref target="RFC1964"/>
        by the MIT, Heimdal, and Microsoft Kerberos 
        implementations. This document provides a formal specification of the unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED message.

            described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="The Unencrypted Form Of The KRB-CRED">
        <t>
        The unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED contains EncryptedData as defined
        in Section 5.2.9 <xref target="RFC4120"/>.   
        The encryption type (etype) MUST BE specified as 0.
        The optional key version number (kvno) SHOULD NOT be present.
        The cipher text (cipher) is a copy of the EncKrbCredPart as defined in Section 5.8.1
        <xref target="RFC4120"/> 
        which is in clear text. 
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
          <t>
           The KRB-CRED message contains sensitive information related to
           Kerberos credentials being transferred, such as their secret
           session keys, client and server principal names, and validity
           period. Possession of this information, along with the ticket
           itself, would allow an attacker to impersonate the client named
           in the ticket. The possibility of modification of the KRB-CRED enables
           the substitution of a credential by the attacker which can result in the
           recipients use the credentials of a client which was not intended.
           As a result, the KRB-CRED message must be carefully safeguarded.
           </t>
           <t>
           The use of an unencrypted form of the KRB-CRED message MUST only be used with a transport where
           sender and recipient identities can been established be known to each other 
           and provides confidentiality and integrity. 
           Examples of transports which MAY be securely used to transport an unencrypted KRB-CRED message
           would include Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246"/> where mutual authentication has been established
           and those encoded within encrypted and signed
           SAML <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os">Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0</xref>
           statement.

                This document defines extensions to the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol to specify a standard way of accessing, managing, and sharing contact information based on the vCard format.

        <section title="Introduction and Overview">
            <t>
                Address books containing contact information are a key component of personal information management tools, such as email, calendaring and scheduling, and instant messaging clients. To date several protocols have been used for remote access to contact data, including <xref target="RFC4510">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</xref>, <xref target='IMSP'>Internet Message Support Protocol (IMSP)</xref> and <xref target="RFC2244">Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP)</xref>, together with SyncML used for synchronization of such data.
            </t>
            <t>
                <xref target="RFC4918">WebDAV</xref> offers a number of advantages as a framework or basis for address book access and management. Most of these advantages boil down to a significant reduction in design costs, implementation costs, interoperability test costs and deployment costs.
            </t>
            <t>
                The key features of address book support with WebDAV are:
            </t>
            <t>
            <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                    Ability to use multiple address books with hierarchical layout.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Ability to control access to individual address books and address entries as per <xref target='RFC3744'>WebDAV ACL</xref>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Principal collections  can be used to enumerate and query other users on the system as per <xref target='RFC3744'>WebDAV ACL</xref>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Server-side searching of address data, avoiding the need for clients to download an entire address book in order to do a quick address 'expansion' operation.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Well-defined internationalization support through WebDAV's use of XML.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Use of <xref target="RFC2426">vCards</xref> for well defined address schema to enhance client interoperability.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Many limited clients (e.g. mobile devices) contain an HTTP stack which makes implementing WebDAV much easier than other protocols.
                </t>
            </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                The key disadvantages of address book support in WebDAV are:
            </t>
            <t>
            <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                    Lack of change notification. Many of the alternative protocols also lack this ability. However, an extension for push notifications could easily be developed.
                </t>
            </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                vCard is a MIME directory profile aimed at encapsulating personal addressing and contact information about people. The specification of vCard was originally done by the Versit consortium, with a subsequent 3.0 version standardized by the <xref target="RFC2426">IETF</xref>. vCard is in wide spread use in email clients and mobile devices as a means of encapsulating address information for transport via email, or for import/export and synchronization operations.
            </t>
            <t>
                An update to vCard - vCard v4 - is currently being developed <xref target="I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev"/>and is compatible with this specification.
            </t>

        <section title="Conventions" anchor="conventions">
            <t>
                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
            </t>
            <t>
                The term "protected" is used in the Conformance field of property definitions as defined in Section 15 of <xref target="RFC4918"/>.
            </t>
              <t>
                This document uses XML DTD fragments (<xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126"/>, Section 3.2) as a purely notational convention.  WebDAV request and response bodies cannot be validated by a DTD due to the specific extensibility rules defined in Section 17 of [RFC4918] and due to the fact that all XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace name "DAV:".  In particular:
                <list style='numbers'>
                    <t>element names use the "DAV:" namespace,</t>
                    <t>element ordering is irrelevant unless explicitly stated,</t>
                    <t>extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child elements) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise,</t>
                    <t>extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for this element) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise.</t>
                </list>
              </t>
            <t>
                The namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:carddav" is reserved for the XML elements defined in this specification, its revisions, and related CardDAV specifications. XML elements defined by individual implementations MUST NOT use the "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:carddav" namespace, and instead should use a namespace that they control.
            </t>
              <t>
                When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:carddav" are referenced in this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the strings "DAV:" and "CARDDAV:" will be prefixed to the element types, respectively.
              </t>
              <t>
                This document inherits, and sometimes extends, DTD productions from Section 14 of <xref target="RFC4918"/>.
              </t>
            <t>
                Also note that some CardDAV XML element names are identical to WebDAV XML element names, though their namespace differs. Care must be taken not to confuse the two sets of names.

                        MUST advertise support on all address book collections and address object resources for the address book reports in the DAV:supported-report-set property, as defined in <xref target="RFC3253">Versioning Extensions to WebDAV</xref>.

        <section title="Address Book Data Model">
            <t>
                As a brief overview, a CardDAV address book is modeled as a WebDAV collection with a well defined structure; each of these address book collections contain a number of resources representing address objects as their direct child resources. Each resource representing an address object is called an "address object resource".  Each address object resource and each address book collection can be individually locked and have individual WebDAV properties.  Requirements derived from this model are provided in <xref target="vcard-object-resource-restrictions"/> and <xref target="addressbook-collection"/>.
            </t>
            <section title="Address Book Server" anchor="Repository">
                <t>
                    A CardDAV server is an address-aware engine combined with a WebDAV server. The server may include address data in some parts of its URL namespace, and non-address data in other parts.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A WebDAV server can advertise itself as a CardDAV server if it supports the functionality defined in this specification at any point within the root of its repository. That might mean that address data is spread throughout the repository and mixed with non-address data in nearby collections (e.g. address data may be found in /lisa/addressbook/ as well as in /bernard/addressbook/, and non-address data in /lisa/calendars/). Or, it might mean that address data can be found only in certain sections of the repository (e.g. /addressbooks/user/). Address book features are only required in the repository sections that are or contain address objects. So a repository confining address data to the /carddav/ collection would only need to support the CardDAV required features within that collection. 
                </t>
                <t>
                    The CardDAV server is the canonical location for address data and state information. Clients may submit requests to change data or download data. Clients may store address objects offline and attempt to synchronize at a later time. Address data on the server can change between the time of last synchronization and when attempting an update, as address book collections may be shared and accessible via multiple clients. Entity tags and locking help this work.

        <section title="Address Book Resources">
            <section title="Address Object Resources"
            anchor="vcard-object-resource-restrictions">
                <t>
                    This specification uses vCard as the default format for address or contact information being stored on the server. However, this specification does allow other formats for address data provided that the server advertises support for those additional formats as described below. The requirements in this section pertain to vCard address data, or formats that follow the semantics of vCard data.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Address object resources contained in address book collections MUST contain a single vCard component only.
                </t>
                <t>
                    vCard components in an address book collection MUST have a UID property value that MUST be unique in the scope of the address book collection in which it is contained.
                </t>
                <section title="Data Type Conversion">
                	<t>
                		Servers might support more than one primary media type for address object resources, for example vCard v3.0 and vCard v4.0. In such cases servers have to accept all media types that they advertise via the CARDDAV:supported-address-data WebDAV property (see <xref target='supported-address-data'/>).
                	</t>
                	<t>
                		However, clients can use standard HTTP content negotiation behavior (the Accept request header defined in Section 14.1 of <xref target='RFC2616'/>) to request that an address object resource's data be returned in a specific media type format. For example, a client only capable of handling vCard v3.0 would only want to have address object resources returned in v3.0 format.
                	</t>
                	<t>
                		Additionally, REPORT requests, defined later in this specification, allow for the return of address object resource data within an XML response body. Again, the client can use content negotiation to request that data be returned in a specific media type by specifying appropriate attributes on the CARDDAV:address-data XML element used in the request body (see <xref target='addressbook_data_element'/>).
                	</t>
                	<t>
                		In some cases it might not be possible for a server to convert from one media type to another. When that happens, the server MUST return the CARDDAV:supported-address-data-conversion precondition (see below) in the response body (when the failure to convert applies to the entire response) or use that same precondition code in the DAV:response XML element in the response for the targeted address object resource when one of the REPORTs defined below is used. See <xref target='unsupported_conversion_example'/> for an example of this.

                        <t>
                            This specification creates additional preconditions for the GET method.

                        <t>

                                    (CARDDAV:supported-address-data-conversion): The resource targeted by the GET request can be converted to the media type specified in the Accept request header included with the request;

                <t>
                    Address book collections appear to clients as a WebDAV  collection resource, identified by a URL. An address book collection MUST report the DAV:collection and CARDDAV:addressbook XML elements in the value of the DAV:resourcetype property. The element type declaration for CARDDAV:addressbook is:

                </t>
                <t>
                    An address book collection can be created through provisioning (e.g., automatically created when a user's account is provisioned), or it can be created with the extended MKCOL method (see <xref target="METHOD_MKCOL"/>). This can be used by a user to create additional address books (e.g., "soccer team members") or for users to share an address book (e.g., "sales team contacts"). Note however that this document doesn't define what extra address book collections are for. Users must rely on non-standard cues to find out what an address book collection is for, or use the CARDDAV:addressbook-description property defined in <xref target='addressbook-description'/> to provide such a cue.

                        Address book collections MUST only contain address object resources and collections that are not address book collections. i.e., the only "top-level" non-collection resources allowed in an address book collection are address object resources. This ensures that address book clients do not have to deal with non-address data in an address book collection, though they do have to distinguish between address object resources and collections when using standard WebDAV techniques to examine the contents of a collection.

This specification does not define how collections contained in an address book collection are used or how they relate to any address object resources contained in the address book collection.

                <t>
                    Address book collections and address object resources may be created by either a CardDAV client or by the CardDAV server. This specification defines restrictions and a data model that both clients and servers MUST adhere to when manipulating such address data. 
                </t>

                    <t>
                        An HTTP request using the extended MKCOL method <xref target='RFC5689'/> can be used to create a new address book collection resource. A server MAY restrict address book collection creation to particular collections.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        To create an address book, the client sends an extended MKCOL request to the server and in the body of the request sets the DAV:resourcetype property to the resource type for an address book collection as defined in <xref target='addressbook-collection'/>.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Support for creating address books on the server is only RECOMMENDED and not REQUIRED because some address book stores only support one address book per user (or principal), and those are typically pre-created for each account. However, servers and clients are strongly encouraged to support address book creation whenever possible to allow users to create multiple address book collections to help organize their data better.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The DAV:displayname property can be used for a human-readable name of the address book. Clients can either specify the value of the DAV:displayname property in the request body of the extended MKCOL request, or alternatively issue a PROPPATCH request to change the DAV:displayname property to the appropriate value immediately after using the extended MKCOL request. When displaying address book collections to users, clients SHOULD check the DAV:displayname property and use that value as the name of the address book. In the event that the DAV:displayname property is not set, the client MAY use the last part of the address book collection URI as the name, however that path segment may be "opaque" and not represent any meaningful human-readable text.

                    <t>
                        Clients populate address book collections with address object resources. The URL for each address object resource is entirely arbitrary, and does not need to bear a specific relationship (but might) to the address object resource's vCard properties or other metadata. New address object resources MUST be created with a PUT request targeted at an unmapped URI. A PUT request targeted at a mapped URI updates an existing address object resource.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        When servers create new resources, it's not hard for the server to choose a unique URL. It's slightly tougher for clients, because a client might not want to examine all resources in the collection, and might not want to lock the entire collection to ensure that a new one isn't created with a name collision. However, there is an HTTP feature to mitigate this. If the client intends to create a new address resource the client SHOULD use the HTTP header "If-None-Match: *" on the PUT request. The Request-URI on the PUT request MUST include the target collection, where the resource is to be created, plus the name of the resource in the last path segment. The "If-None-Match" header ensures that the client will not inadvertently overwrite an existing resource even, if the last path segment turned out to already be used.

                        The request to change an existing address object resource without overwriting a change made on the server, uses a specific ETag in an "If-Match" header, rather than the "If-None-Match" header.

                         vCard provides a "standard mechanism for doing non-standard things". This extension support allows implementers to make use of non-standard vCard properties and parameters whose names are prefixed with the text "X-".

                         Servers may need to enforce rules for their own "private" properties or parameters, so servers MAY reject any attempt by the client to change those or use values for those outside of any restrictions the server may have. Servers SHOULD ensure that any "private" properties or parameters it uses follow the convention of including a vendor id in the "X-" name, as described in Section 3.8 of <xref target="RFC2426"/>, e.g., "X-ABC-PRIVATE".

                        The DAV:getetag property MUST be defined and set to a strong entity tag on all address object resources.
                      </t>
                      <t>
                        A response to a GET request targeted at an address object resource MUST contain an ETag response header field indicating the current value of the strong entity tag of the address object resource.
                      </t>
                      <t>
                        Servers SHOULD return a strong entity tag (ETag header) in a PUT response when the stored address object resource is equivalent by octet equality to the address object resource submitted in the body of the PUT request. This allows clients to reliably use the returned strong entity tag for data synchronization purposes. For instance, the client can do a PROPFIND request on the stored address object resource and have the DAV:getetag property returned, and compare that value with the strong entity tag it received on the PUT response, and know that if they are equal, then the address object resource on the server has not been changed.
                      </t>
                      <t>
                        In the case where the data stored by a server as a result of a PUT request is not equivalent by octet equality to the submitted address object resource, the behavior of the ETag response header is not specified here, with the exception that a strong entity tag MUST NOT be returned in the response. As a result, clients may need to retrieve the modified address object resource (and ETag) as a basis for further changes, rather than use the address object resource it had sent with the PUT request.

        <section title="Address Book Reports" anchor="reports">
            <t>
                This section defines the reports that CardDAV servers MUST support on address book collections and address object resources.     
            </t>
            <t>
                CardDAV servers MUST advertise support for these reports on all address book collections and address object resources with the DAV:supported-report-set property defined in Section 3.1.5 of 
                <xref target="RFC3253"/>. CardDAV servers MAY also advertise support for these reports on ordinary collections. 
            </t>
            <t>
                Some of these reports allow address data (from possibly multiple resources) to be returned. 
            </t>
            <section title="REPORT Method" anchor="METHOD_REPORT">
                <t>
                    The REPORT method (defined in Section 3.6 of 
                    <xref target="RFC3253"/>) provides an extensible mechanism for obtaining information about a resource. Unlike the PROPFIND method, which returns the value of one or more named properties, the REPORT method can involve more complex processing. REPORT is valuable in cases where the server has access to all of the information needed to perform the complex request (such as a query), and where it would require multiple requests for the client to retrieve the information needed to perform the same request.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A server that supports this specification MUST support the DAV:expand-property report (defined in Section 3.8 of 
                    <xref target="RFC3253"/>).
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Ordinary Collections">
                <t>
                    Servers MAY support the reports defined in this document on ordinary collections (collections that are not address book collections) in addition to address book collections or address object resources. In computing responses to the reports on ordinary collections, servers MUST only consider address object resources contained in address book collections that are targeted by the REPORT based on the value of the Depth request header.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Searching Text: Collations" anchor="collation">
            <t>
              Some of the reports defined in this section do text matches of character strings provided by the client and compared to stored address data. Since vCard data is by default encoded in the UTF-8 charset and may include  characters outside of the US-ASCII charset range in some property and parameter values, there is a need to ensure that text matching follows well-defined rules.
            </t>
            <t>
              To deal with this, this specification makes use of the IANA Collation Registry defined in <xref target="RFC4790"/> to specify collations that may be used to carry out the text comparison operations with a well-defined rule.
            </t>
            <t>
              Collations supported by the server MUST support "equality" and "substring" match operations as per <xref target="RFC4790"/> Section 4.2, including the "prefix" and "suffix" options for "substring" matching. CardDAV uses these match options for "equals", "contains", "starts-with" and "ends-with" match operations.
            </t>
            <t>
              CardDAV servers are REQUIRED to support the "i;ascii-casemap" <xref target="RFC4790"/> and "i;unicode-casemap" <xref target="RFC5051"/> collations, and MAY support other collations.
            </t>
            <t>
              Servers MUST advertise the set of collations that they support via the CARDDAV:supported-collation-set property defined on any resource that supports reports that use collations.
            </t>
            <t>
              In the absence of a collation explicitly specified by the client, or if the client specifies the "default" collation identifier (as defined in <xref target="RFC4790"/> Section 3.1), the server MUST default to using "i;unicode-casemap" as the collation.
            </t>
            <t>
              Wildcards (as defined in <xref target="RFC4790"/> Section 3.2) MUST NOT be used in the collation identifier.
            </t>
            <t>
              If the client chooses a collation not supported by the server, the server MUST respond with a CARDDAV:supported-collation precondition error response.

                    The CARDDAV:addressbook-query REPORT performs a search for all address object resources that match a specified filter. The response of this report will contain all the WebDAV properties and address object resource data specified in the request. In the case of the CARDDAV:address-data XML element, one can explicitly specify the vCard properties that should be returned in the address object resource data that matches the filter.

                <t>
                    The format of this report is modeled on the PROPFIND method. The request and response bodies of the CARDDAV:addressbook-query report use XML elements that are also used by PROPFIND. In particular the request can include XML elements to request WebDAV properties to be returned. When that occurs the response should follow the same behavior as PROPFIND with respect to the DAV:multistatus response elements used to return specific WebDAV property results. For instance, a request to retrieve the value of a WebDAV property which does not exist is an error and MUST be noted with a response XML element which contains a 404 (Not Found) status value.

If the result set is truncated because of such a limit, the response MUST use status code 207, return a DAV:multistatus response body, and indicate a status of 507 (Insufficient Storage) for the request URI. That DAV:response element SHOULD include a DAV:error element with the DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits precondition, as defined in <xref target="RFC3744"/> (Section 9.2).</t>
                    <t>The server SHOULD also include the partial results in additional DAV:response elements. If a client requested limit is being applied, the 507 response for the request URI MUST NOT be included in calculating the limit (e.g., if the client requests that only a single result be returned, and multiple matches are present, then the DAV:multistatus response will include one DAV:response for the matching resource and one DAV:response for the 507 status on the request URI).</t>

                    The CARDDAV:addressbook-multiget REPORT is used to retrieve specific address object resources from within a collection, if the Request-URI is a collection, or to retrieve a specific address object resource, if the Request-URI is a address object resource. This report is similar to the CARDDAV:addressbook-query REPORT (see <xref target="addressbook-query" />), except that it takes a list of DAV:href elements instead of a CARDDAV:filter element to determine which address object resources to return.

If DAV:href elements are present, the scope of the request is the set of resources identified by these elements, which all need to be members (not necessarily internal members) of the resource identified by the Request-URI. Otherwise, the scope is the resource identified by the Request-URI itself.

<!-- Use of Reports -->
            <section title="Restrict the Properties Returned">
                <t>
                    Clients may not need all the properties in a vCard object when presenting information to the user, or looking up specific items for their email address, for example. Since some property data can be large (e.g., PHOTO or SOUND with inline content) clients can choose to ignore those by only requesting the specific items it knows it will use, through use of the CARDDAV:address-data XML element in the relevant reports.
                </t>
                <t>
                    However, if a client needs to make a change to a vCard, it can only change the entire vCard data via a PUT request. There is no way to incrementally make a change to a set of properties within a vCard object resource. As a result the client will have to cache the entire set of properties on a resource that is being changed.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Avoiding Lost Updates">
                <t>
					When resources are accessed by multiple clients, the possibility of clients overwriting each other's changes exists. To alleviate that, clients SHOULD use the If-Match request header on  PUT requests with the ETag of the previously retrieved resource data to check whether the resource was modified since it was previously retrieved. If a pre-condition failure occurs, clients need to reload the resource and go through their own merge or conflict resolution process before writing back the data (again using the If-Match check).
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Client Configuration">
                <t>
                    When CardDAV clients need to be configured, the key piece of information that they require is the principal-URL of the user whose address book information is desired. Servers SHOULD support the DAV:current-user-principal-URL property as defined in <xref target="RFC5397"/> to give clients a fast way to locate user principals.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Given support for SRV records (<xref target='srv'/>) and DAV:current-user-principal-URL <xref target="RFC5397"/>, users only need enter a user identifier, host name and password to configure their client. The client would take the host name and do an SRV lookup to locate the CardDAV server, then execute an authenticated PROPFIND on the root / resource looking for the DAV:current-user-principal-URL property. The value returned gives the client direct access to the user's principal-URL and from there all the related CardDAV properties needed to locate address books.
                </t>
            </section>
    
            <section title="Finding Other Users' Address Books">
                <t>
                    For address book sharing use cases, one might wish to find the address book belonging to another user. To find other users' address books on the same server, the <xref target='RFC3744'>DAV:principal-property-search REPORT</xref> can be used to filter on some properties and return others. To search for an address book owned by a user named "Laurie", the REPORT request body would look like this:

Furthermore, address object resources specified in the CARDDAV:address-data XML element MAY be invalid per their media type specification if the CARDDAV:address-data XML element part of the address book REPORT request did not specify required vCard properties (e.g., UID, etc.) or specified a CARDDAV:prop XML element with the "novalue" attribute set to "yes".

In the later case the vCard data cannot contain the character sequence "]]&gt;" which is the end delimiter for the CDATA section.

                                The "name" attribute specifies the name of the vCard property to return (e.g., "NICKNAME"). The "novalue" attribute can be used by clients to request that the actual value of the property not be returned (if the "novalue" attribute is set to "yes").

                                vCard allows a "group" prefix to appear before a property name in the vCard data. When the "name" attribute does not specify a group prefix, it MUST match properties in the vCard data without a group prefix or with any group prefix. When the "name" attribute includes a group prefix, it MUST match properties that have exactly the same group prefix and name. e.g.: a "name" set to "TEL" will match "TEL", "X-ABC.TEL", "X-ABC-1.TEL" vCard properties. A "name" set to "X-ABC.TEL" will match an "X-ABC.TEL" vCard property only, it will not match "TEL" or "X-ABC-1.TEL".

                                vCard allows a "group" prefix to appear before a property name in the vCard data. When the "name" attribute does not specify a group prefix, it MUST match properties in the vCard data without a group prefix or with any group prefix. When the "name" attribute includes a group prefix, it MUST match properties that have exactly the same group prefix and name. e.g.: a "name" set to "TEL" will match "TEL", "X-ABC.TEL", "X-ABC-1.TEL" vCard properties. A "name" set to "X-ABC.TEL" will match an "X-ABC.TEL" vCard property only, it will not match "TEL" or "X-ABC-1.TEL".

        <section title="Internationalization Considerations">
             
            <t>
                CardDAV allows internationalized strings to be stored and retrieved for the description of address book collections (see <xref target="addressbook-description" />). 
            </t>
            <t>
                The CARDDAV:addressbook-query REPORT (<xref target="addressbook-query" />) includes a text searching option controlled by the CARDDAV:text-match element and details of character handling are covered in the description of that element (see <xref target="text_match_element" />). 
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
              HTTP protocol transactions are sent in the clear over the
              network unless protection from snooping is negotiated. This
              can be accomplished by use of TLS as defined in 
              <xref target="RFC2818"/>.
              In particular, if <xref target='RFC2617'>HTTP Basic authentication</xref> is available, the server MUST allow TLS to be used at the same time, and SHOULD prevent use of Basic authentication when TLS is not in use. Clients SHOULD use TLS whenever possible.
            </t>
            <t>
                With the <xref target='RFC3744'>ACL extension</xref> present, WebDAV allows control over who can access (read or write) any resource on the WebDAV server. In addition, WebDAV ACL provides for an "inheritance" mechanism, whereby resources may inherit access privileges from other resources. Often the "other" resource is a parent collection of the resource itself. Servers are able to support address books that are "private" (accessible only to the "owner"), "shared" (accessible to the owner and other specified authenticated users), and "public" (accessible to any authenticated or unauthenticated users). When provisioning address books of a particular type, servers MUST ensure that the correct privileges are applied on creation, and in particular private and shared address books MUST NOT be accessible by unauthenticated users (to prevent data from being automatically searched or indexed by web "crawlers").
            </t>
            <t>
                Clients SHOULD warn users in an appropriate fashion when they copy or move address data from a private address book to a shared address book or public address book. Clients SHOULD provide a clear indication as to which address books are private, shared or public. Clients SHOULD provide an appropriate warning when changing access privileges for a private or shared address book with data so as to allow unauthenticated users access.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification currently relies on standard HTTP authentication mechanisms for identifying users. These comprise <xref target='RFC2617'>Basic and Digest authentication</xref> as well as <xref target="RFC2818">TLS</xref> using client-side certificates.

        <section title="IANA Consideration">
            <t>
                This document uses a URN to describe a new XML namespace conforming to the registry mechanism described in <xref target="RFC3688"/>.

    This document defines the vCard data format for representing and exchanging
    a variety of information about individuals and other entities (e.g.,
    formatted and structured name and delivery addresses, email address,
    multiple telephone numbers, photograph, logo, audio clips, etc.). This
    document obsoletes RFCs 2425, 2426, and 4770, and updates RFC 2739.

<section title="Introduction">
  <t>Electronic address books have become ubiquitous. Their increased presence
    on portable, connected devices as well as the diversity of platforms
    exchanging contact data call for a standard. This memo defines the vCard
    format, which allows the capture and exchange of information normally stored
    within an address book or directory
    application.</t>
  <t>A high-level overview of the differences from RFCs 2425 and 2426 can be
    found in <xref target="diff"/>.</t>
</section>

<section title="Conventions" anchor="oldsection_Abstract">
  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>

<section title="vCard Format Specification">

  <t>The text/vcard MIME content type (hereafter known as "vCard", see <xref
      target="mime_type_registration"/>) contains
    contact information, typically pertaining to a single contact or group of
    contacts.  The content consists of one or more lines in the format given
    below.</t>

  <section title="Charset">
    <t>The charset (see <xref target="RFC3536"/> for internationalization
      terminology) for vCard is UTF-8 as defined in <xref
        target="RFC3629"/>. There is no way to override this. It is invalid to
      specify a value other than "UTF-8" in the "charset" MIME parameter (see
      <xref target="mime_type_registration"/>).</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Line Delimiting and Folding" anchor="folding">

    <t>Individual lines within vCard are delimited by the <xref
        target="RFC5322"/> line break, which is a CRLF sequence (U+000D followed by U+000A). Long logical lines of text can be split
      into a multiple-physical-line representation using the following folding
      technique. Content lines SHOULD be folded to a maximum width of 75 octets,
      excluding the line break.  Multi-octet characters MUST remain contiguous.
      The rationale for this folding process can be found in <xref
        target="RFC5322"/>, Section 2.1.1.</t>

    <t>A logical line MAY be continued on the next physical line anywhere
      between two characters by inserting a CRLF immediately followed by a
      single white space character (space (U+0020) or horizontal tab
      (U+0009)). The folded line MUST contain at least one character. Any
      sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single white space character is
      ignored (removed) when processing the content type.  For example the
      line:</t>
    <figure><artwork>
  NOTE:This is a long description that exists on a long line.
    </artwork></figure>
    <figure>
      <preamble>can be represented as:</preamble>
      <artwork>
  NOTE:This is a long description
    that exists on a long line.
      </artwork>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <preamble>It could also be represented as:</preamble>
      <artwork>
  NOTE:This is a long descrip
   tion that exists o
   n a long line.
      </artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation of a
      property definition to its single line representation is called unfolding.
      Unfolding is accomplished by regarding CRLF immediately followed by a
      white space character (namely HTAB (U+0009) or SPACE (U+0020))
      as equivalent to no characters at all (i.e., the CRLF and single white
      space character are removed).
      <list>
        <t>Note: It is possible for very simple implementations to generate
          improperly folded lines in the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet sequence.
          For this reason, implementations SHOULD unfold lines in such a way as
          to properly restore the original sequence.</t>
        <t>Note: Unfolding is done differently than in <xref target="RFC5322"/>.
          Unfolding in <xref target="RFC5322"/> only removes the CRLF, not the
          space following it.</t>
      </list>
    </t>


    <t>Folding is done after any content encoding of a type value. Unfolding is
      done before any decoding of a type value in a content line.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="ABNF Format Definition">

    <t>The following ABNF uses the notation of <xref target="RFC5234"/>, which
      also defines CRLF, WSP, DQUOTE, VCHAR, ALPHA, and DIGIT.</t>

    <figure>
      <artwork>
  vcard-entity = 1*vcard

  vcard = "BEGIN:VCARD" CRLF
          "VERSION:4.0" CRLF
          1*contentline
          "END:VCARD" CRLF
    ; A vCard object MUST include the VERSION and FN properties.
    ; VERSION MUST come immediately after BEGIN:VCARD.

  contentline = [group "."] name *(";" param) ":" value CRLF
    ; When parsing a content line, folded lines must first
    ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure
    ; described in section 3.2.
    ; When generating a content line, lines longer than 75
    ; characters SHOULD be folded according to the folding
    ; procedure described in section 3.2.

  group = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
  name  = "SOURCE" / "KIND" / "FN" / "N" / "NICKNAME"
        / "PHOTO" / "BDAY" / "ANNIVERSARY" / "GENDER" / "ADR" / "TEL"
        / "EMAIL" / "IMPP" / "LANG" / "TZ" / "GEO" / "TITLE" / "ROLE"
        / "LOGO" / "ORG" / "MEMBER" / "RELATED" / "CATEGORIES"
        / "NOTE" / "PRODID" / "REV" / "SOUND" / "UID" / "CLIENTPIDMAP"
        / "URL" / "KEY" / "FBURL" / "CALADRURI" / "CALURI" / "XML"
        / iana-token / x-name
    ; Parsing of the param and value is based on the "name" as
    ; defined in ABNF sections below.
    ; Group and name are case-insensitive.

  iana-token = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
    ; identifier registered with IANA

  x-name = "x-" 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
    ; Names that begin with "x-" or "X-" are
    ; reserved for experimental use, not intended for released
    ; products, or for use in bilateral agreements.

  param = language-param / value-param / pref-param / pid-param
        / type-param / geo-parameter / tz-parameter / sort-as-param
        / calscale-param / any-param
    ; Allowed parameters depend on property name.

  param-value = *SAFE-CHAR / DQUOTE *QSAFE-CHAR DQUOTE

  any-param  = (iana-token / x-name) "=" param-value *("," param-value)

  NON-ASCII = UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
    ; UTF8-{2,3,4} are defined in [RFC3629]

  QSAFE-CHAR = WSP / "!" / %x23-7E / NON-ASCII
    ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE

  SAFE-CHAR = WSP / "!" / %x23-39 / %x3C-7E / NON-ASCII
    ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE, ";", ":"

  VALUE-CHAR = WSP / VCHAR / NON-ASCII
    ; Any textual character
      </artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>A line that begins with a white space character is a continuation of the
      previous line, as described in <xref target="folding"/>. The white space character and
      immediately preceeding CRLF should be discarded when reconstructing the
      original line. Note that this line-folding convention differs from that
      found in <xref target="RFC5322"/>, in that the sequence
      &lt;CRLF&gt;&lt;WSP&gt; found anywhere in the content indicates a
      continued line and should be removed.</t>

    <t>Property names and parameter names are case insensitive (e.g., the
      property name "fn" is the same as "FN" and "Fn"). Parameter values MAY be
      case-sensitive or case-insensitive, depending on their definition.
      Parameter values that are not explicitly defined as being case-sensitive
      are case-insenstive. Based on experience with vCard 3 interoperability, it
      is RECOMMENDED that property and parameter names be upper-case on
      output.</t>

    <t>The group construct is used to group related properties together. The
      group name is a syntactic convention used to indicate that all property
      names prefaced with the same group name SHOULD be grouped together when
      displayed by an application. It has no other significance.
      Implementations that do not understand or support grouping MAY simply
      strip off any text before a "." to the left of the type name and present
      the types and values as normal.</t>

  <t>Property cardinalities are indicated using the following notation, which is
    based on ABNF (see <xref target="RFC5234"/>, section 3.6):</t>
  <texttable>
    <ttcol align="center">Cardinality</ttcol>
    <ttcol align="left">Meaning</ttcol>

    <c>1</c>
    <c>Exactly one instance per vCard MUST be present.</c>

    <c>*1</c>
    <c>Exactly one instance per vCard MAY be present.</c>

    <c>1*</c>
    <c>One or more instances per vCard MUST be present.</c>

    <c>*</c>
    <c>One or more instances per vCard MAY be present.</c>
  </texttable>

    <t>Properties defined in a vCard instance may have multiple values depending
      on the property cardinality. The general rule for encoding multi-valued
      properties is to simply create a new content line for each value
      (including the property name).  However, it should be noted that some
      value types support encoding multiple values in a single content line by
      separating the values with a comma ",".  This approach has been taken for
      several of the content types defined below (date, time, integer,
      float).</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Property Value Escaping">
    <t>Some properties may contain one or more values delimited by a COMMA
      character (U+002C). Therefore, a COMMA character in a value MUST
      be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (U+005C), even for
      properties that don't allow multiple instances (for consistency).</t>

    <t>Some properties (e.g. N and ADR) comprise multiple fields delimited by a
      SEMI-COLON character (U+003B). Therefore, a SEMI-COLON in a
      field of such a "compound" property MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH
      character. SEMI-COLON characters in non-compound properties MAY be
      escaped. On input, an escaped SEMI-COLON character is never a field
      separator. An unescaped SEMI-COLON character may be a field
      separator, depending on the property in which it appears.</t>

    <t>Furthermore, some fields of compound properties may contain a list of
      values delimited by a COMMA character. Therefore, a COMMA character in one
      of a field's values MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character, even for
      fields that don't allow multiple values (for consistency). Compound
      properties allowing multiple instances MUST NOT be encoded in a single
      content line.</t>

    <t>Finally, BACKSLASH characters in values MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH
      character. NEWLINE (U+000A) characters in values MUST be encoded
      by two characters: a BACKSLASH followed by either an 'n' (U+006E)
      or an 'N' (U+004E).</t>

    <t>In all other cases, escaping MUST NOT be used.</t>

  <section title="ALTID" anchor="ALTID">
    <t>The ALTID parameter is used to "tag" property instances as being

      translations of a property in multiple languages generates multiple
      property instances having different LANGUAGE (<xref target="LANGUAGE"/>)
      parameter which are tagged with the same ALTID value.</t>
    <t>This parameter's value is treated as an opaque string. Its sole purpose
      is to be compared for equality against other ALTID parameter values.</t>
    <t>Two property instances are considered alternative representations of the
      same logical property if and only if their names as well as the value of
      their ALTID parameters are identical. Property instances without the ALTID
      parameter MUST NOT be considered an alternative representation of any
      other property instance. Values for the ALTID parameter are not globally
      unique: they MAY be reused for different property names.</t>
    <t>Property instances having the same ALTID parameter value count as 1
      toward cardinality. Therefore, since N (<xref target="N"/>) has
      cardinality *1 and TITLE (<xref target="TITLE"/>) has cardinality

  <section title="TYPE" anchor="TYPE">
    <t>The TYPE parameter has multiple, different uses. In general, it is a
      way of specifying class characteristics of the associated property. Most

      parameter: FN, NICKNAME, PHOTO, ADR, TEL, EMAIL, IMPP, LANG, TZ,
      GEO, TITLE, ROLE, LOGO, ORG, RELATED, CATEGORIES, NOTE, SOUND, URL, KEY,
      FBURL, CALADRURI, and CALURI. The TYPE parameter MUST NOT be
      applied on other properties defined in this document.</t>
    <t>The "work" and "home" values act like tags. The "work" value implies that
      the property is related to an individual's work place, while the "home"
      value implies that the property is related to an individual's personal
      life.  When neither "work" nor "home" is present, it is implied that the
      property is related to both an individual's work place and personal life
      in the case that the KIND property's value is "individual", or to none in

      "data" scheme allows the media type to be explicitly indicated as part of

      media type as part of the URI resolution process, with the Content-Type

      Gregorian system. It is the default when the parameter is absent.
      Additional values may be defined in extension documents and registered

    <section title="KIND" anchor="KIND">
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Purpose:">To specify the kind of object the vCard
            represents.</t>
          <t hangText="Value type:">A single text value.</t>
          <t hangText="Cardinality:">*1</t>
          <t hangText="Special notes:">The value may be one of the following:
            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="&quot;individual&quot;">for a vCard representing a
                single person or entity.  This is the default kind of vCard.</t>
              <t hangText="&quot;group&quot;">for a vCard representing a group
                of persons or entities.  The group's member entities can be
                other vCards or other types of entities, such as email addresses
                or web sites.  A group vCard will usually contain MEMBER
                properties to specify the members of the group, but it is not
                required to.  A group vCard without MEMBER properties can be
                considered an abstract grouping, or one whose members are known
                empirically (perhaps "IETF Participants" or "Republican U.S.
                Senators").</t>
              <t>All properties in a group vCard apply to the group as a whole,
                and not to any particular MEMBER.  For example, an EMAIL
                property might specify the address of a mailing list associated
                with the group, and an IMPP property might refer to a group chat
                room.</t>
              <t hangText="&quot;org&quot;">for a vCard representing an
                organization.  An organization vCard will not (in fact, MUST
                NOT) contain MEMBER properties, and so these are something of a
                cross between "individual" and "group".  An organization is a
                single entity, but not a person.  It might represent a business
                or government, a department or division within a business or
                government, a club, an association, or the like.</t>
              <t>All properties in an organization vCard apply to the
                organization as a whole, as is the case with a group vCard.  For
                example, an EMAIL property might specify the address of a
                contact point for the organization.</t>
              <t hangText="&quot;location&quot;">for a named geographical
                place.  A location vCard will usually contain a GEO property,
                but it is not required to.  A location vCard without a GEO
                property can be considered an abstract location, or one whose
                definition is known empirically (perhaps "New England" or "The
                Seashore").</t>
              <t>All properties in a location vCard apply to the location
                itself, and not with any entity that might exist at that
                location.  For example, in a vCard for an office building, an
                ADR property might give the mailing address for the building,
                and a TEL property might specify the telephone number of the
                receptionist.</t>
              <t hangText="An x-name.">vCards MAY include private or
                experimental values for KIND.  Remember that x-name values are
                not intended for general use, and are unlikely to
                interoperate.</t>
              <t hangText="An iana-token.">Additional values may be registered
                with IANA (see <xref target="iana_values"/>).  A new value's
                specification document MUST specify which properties make sense
                for that new kind of vCard and which do not.</t>
            </list>
            Implementations MUST support the specific string values defined
            above.  If this property is absent, "individual" MUST be assumed as
            the default.  If this property is present but the implementation
            does not understand its value (the value is an x-name or iana-token
            that the implementation does not support), the implementation SHOULD
            act in a neutral way, which usually means treating the vCard as
            though its kind were "individual".  The presence of MEMBER
            properties MAY, however, be taken as an indication that the unknown
            kind is an extension of "group".</t>
          <t>Clients often need to visually distinguish contacts based on what
            they represent, and the KIND property provides a direct way for them
            to do so. For example, when displaying contacts in a list, an icon
            could be displayed next to each one, using distinctive icons for the
            different kinds; a client might use an outline of a single person to
            represent an "individual", an outline of multiple people to
            represent a "group", and so on.  Alternatively, or in addition, a
            client might choose to segregate different kinds of vCards to
            different panes, tabs, or selections in the user interface.</t>
          <t>Some clients might also make functional distinctions among the
            kinds, ignoring "location" vCards for some purposes and considering
            only "location" vCards for others.</t>
          <t>When designing those sorts of visual and functional distinctions,
            client implementations have to decide how to fit unsupported kinds
            into the scheme.  What icon is used for them?  The one for
            "individual"?  A unique one, such as an icon of a question-mark?
            Which tab do they go into?  It is beyond the scope of this
            specification to answer these questions, but these are things
            implementors need to consider.</t>

          <t>Efforts are currently being directed at creating a standard URI
            scheme for expressing time zone information. Usage of such a scheme

          <t>Note that utc-offset values SHOULD NOT be used because the UTC
            offset varies with time - not just because of the usual daylight
            saving time shifts that occur in may regions, but often entire
            regions will "re-base" their overall offset. The actual offset may
            be +/- 1 hour (or perhaps a little more) than the one given.</t>

<section title="Synchronization" anchor="synchronization">

  <t>vCard data often needs to be synchronized between devices. In this context,
    synchronization is defined as the intelligent merging of two representations
    of the same object. vCard 4.0 includes mechanisms to aid this process.</t>

  <section title="Mechanisms">

    <t>Two mechanisms are available: the UID property is used to match
      multiple instances of the same vCard, while the PID parameter is used to
      match multiple instances of the same property.</t>

    <t>The term "matching" is used here to mean recognizing that two instances
      are in fact representations of the same object. For example, a single
      vCard that is shared with someone results in two vCard instances. After
      they have evolved separately, they still represent the same object, and
      therefore may be matched by a synchronization engine.</t>

    <section title="Matching vCard Instances">
      <t>vCard instances for which the UID properties (<xref target="UID"/>) are
        equivalent MUST be matched. Equivalence is determined as specified in
        <xref target="RFC3986"/>, Section 6.</t>

      <t>In all other cases, vCard instances MAY be matched at the discretion of
        the synchronization engine.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Matching Property Instances" anchor="propmatching">
      <t>Property instances belonging to unmatched vCards MUST NOT be
        matched.</t>

      <t>Property instances whose name (e.g. EMAIL, TEL, etc.) is not the same
        MUST NOT be matched.</t>

      <t>Property instances whose name is CLIENTPIDMAP are handled separately
        and MUST NOT be matched. The synchronization MUST ensure that there is
        consistency of CLIENTPIDMAPs among matched vCard instances.</t>

      <t>Property instances belonging to matched vCards, whose name is the same,
        and whose maximum cardinality is 1 MUST be matched.</t>

      <t>Property instances belonging to matched vCards, whose name is the same,
        and whose PID parameters match MUST be matched. See <xref
          target="pidmatching"/> for details on PID matching.</t>

      <t>In all other cases, property instances MAY be matched at the discretion
        of the synchronization engine.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PID Matching" anchor="pidmatching">
      <t>Two PID values for which the first fields are equivalent represent the
        same local value.</t>

      <t>Two PID values representing the same local value and for which the
        second fields point to CLIENTPIDMAP properties whose second field URIs
        are equivalent (as specified in <xref target="RFC3986"/>, Section 6)
        also represent the same global value.</t>

      <t>PID parameters for which at least one pair of their values represent

      <t>The FN properties are matched because the PID parameters have the
        same global value. Since the property value is the same, no update takes
        place.</t>
      <t>The N properties are matched automatically because their maximum
        cardinality is 1. Since the property value is the same, no update takes
        place.</t>
      <t>The EMAIL properties are matched because the PID parameters have the
        same global value. Since the property value is the same, no update takes
        place.</t>
      <t>The TEL property in the new vCard is not matched to any in the stored
        vCard because no property in the stored vCard has the same name.
        Therefore, this property is copied from the new vCard to the stored
        vCard.</t>
      <t>The CLIENTPIDMAP property is handled separately by the synchronization
        engine. It ensures that it is consistent with the stored one. If it was
        not, the results would be up to the synchronization engine, and thus
        undefined by this document.</t>

      <t>A new email address and a new phone number are added to the vCard on

      <t>On the first device, the same PID source identifier (1) is reused for
        the new EMAIL and TEL properties. On the second device, a new source
        identifier (2) is generated, and a corresponding CLIENTPIDMAP property
        is created. It contains the second device's identifier,

      <t>Internet mail is often used to transport vCards and is subject to many
        well known security attacks, including monitoring, replay, and forgery.
        Care should be taken by any directory service in allowing information to
        leave the scope of the service itself, where any access controls or
        confidentiality can no longer be guaranteed.  Applications should also
        take care to display directory data in a "safe" environment</t>
      <t>vCards can carry cryptographic keys or certificates, as described in
        <xref target="KEY"/>.</t>
      <t>vCards often carry information that can be sensitive (e.g.  birthday,
        address, and phone information).  Although vCards have no inherent
        authentication or confidentiality provisions, they can easily be carried by any
        security mechanism that transfers MIME objects to address authentication
        or confidentiality (e.g. S/MIME <xref target="RFC5751"/>, OpenPGP <xref
          target="RFC4880"/>). In cases where the confidentiality or authenticity of
        information contained in vCard is a concern, the vCard SHOULD be
        transported using one of these secure mechanisms.  The KEY property
        (<xref target="KEY"/>) can be used to transport the public key used by
        these mechanisms.</t>
      <t>The information in a vCard may become out of date. In cases where the
        vitality of data is important to an originator of a vCard, the SOURCE
        property (<xref target="SOURCE"/>) SHOULD be specified. In addition, the
        "REV" type described in section <xref target="REV"/> can be specified to
        indicate the last time that the vCard data was updated.</t>
      <t>Many vCard properties may be used to transport URIs. Please refer to
        <xref target="RFC3986"/> section 7 for considerations related to
        URIs.</t>

  <section title="Registering New vCard Elements" anchor="iana_registration">

    <t>This section defines the process for registering new or modified vCard
      elements (i.e. properties, parameters, value data types, and values) with
      IANA. It does not contain any immediate IANA actions.</t>

    <section title="Registration Procedure">
      <t>The IETF will create a mailing list,
        <eref target="mailto:vcarddav@ietf.org">vcarddav@ietf.org</eref>, which can
        be used for public discussion of vCard element proposals prior to
        registration.  Use of the mailing list is strongly encouraged.  The IESG
        will appoint a designated expert who will monitor the
        <eref target="mailto:vcarddav@ietf.org">vcarddav@ietf.org</eref> mailing list
        and review registrations.</t>

      <t>Registration of new vCard elements MUST be reviewed by the
        designated expert and published in an RFC.  A Standard Track RFC is
        REQUIRED for the registration of new value data types that modify
        existing properties.  A Standard Track RFC is also REQUIRED for
        registration of vCard elements that modify vCard elements previously
        documented in a Standard Track RFC.</t>

      <t>The registration procedure begins when a completed registration
        template, defined in the sections below, is sent to
        <eref target="mailto:vcarddav@ietf.org">vcarddav@ietf.org</eref> and
        <eref target="mailto:iana@iana.org">iana@iana.org</eref>.  The
        designated expert is expected to tell IANA and the submitter of the
        registration within two weeks whether the registration is approved,
        approved with minor changes, or rejected with cause.  When a
        registration is rejected with cause, it can be re-submitted if the
        concerns listed in the cause are addressed.  Decisions made by the
        designated expert can be appealed to the IESG Applications Area
        Director, then to the IESG.  They follow the normal appeals procedure
        for IESG decisions.</t>

      <t>Once the registration procedure concludes successfully, IANA creates or
        modifies the corresponding record in the vCard registry. The completed
        registration template is discarded.</t>

      <t>An RFC specifying new vCard elements MUST include the completed
        registration templates, which MAY be expanded with additional
        information. These completed templates are intended to go in the body of
        the document, not in the IANA Considerations section.</t>

      <t>Finally, note that there is an XML representation for vCard defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardxml"/>. An XML representation
        SHOULD be defined for new vCard elements.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Vendor Namespace">

      <t>The vendor namespace is used for vCard elements associated with
        commercially available products.  "Vendor" or "producer" are construed
        as equivalent and very broadly in this context.</t>

      <t>A registration may be placed in the vendor namespace by anyone who
        needs to interchange files associated with the particular product.
        However, the registration formally belongs to the vendor or organization
        handling the vCard elements in the namespace being registered.  Changes
        to the specification will be made at their request, as discussed in
        subsequent sections.</t>

      <t>vCard elements belonging to the vendor namespace will be distinguished
        by the "VND-" prefix.  This is followed by an IANA-registered Private
        Enterprise Number (PEN), a dash, and a vCard element designation of the
        vendor's choosing (e.g., "VND-123456-MUDPIE").</t>

      <t>While public exposure and review of vCard elements to be registered in
        the vendor namespace is not required, using the <eref
          target="mailto:vcarddav@ietf.org">vcarddav@ietf.org</eref> mailing list for
        review is strongly encouraged to improve the quality of those
        specifications.  Registrations in the vendor namespace may be submitted
        directly to the IANA.</t>

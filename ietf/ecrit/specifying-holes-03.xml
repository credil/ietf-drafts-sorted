      <t>This document describes how holes can be specified in geodetic service boundaries. One means of implementing a search solution in a service database, such as one might provide with a LoST server, is described.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>The LoST protocol <xref target="RFC5222"/> maps service and locations to destination addresses.  A LoST server does this by provisioning boundary maps or areas against service URNs.  The boundary is a polygon made up of sets of geodetic coordinates specifying an enclosed area. In some circumstances an area enclosed by a polygon, also known as an exterior polygon, may contain exception areas, or holes, that for the same service must yield a different destination to that described by the larger area.
      </t>

      <t>This document describes the RECOMMENDED approach to specifying holes in service boundaries defined using a GML encoding for the polygons and their internal elements (holes).

        </t>

        <t>The working group considered that the types of regions described in this memo could be represented in various ways as polygons without holes, but concluded on the recommendations here to avoid potential problems with the arbitrary division of regions and to align with existing geospatial system practices.

    <section title="Specifying Holes">

      <t>Holes related to an exterior boundary polygon MUST adhere to the following rules:

      <t>If two or more holes overlap or share a common boundary then these represent a single hole.  The internal elements (holes) should have common boundaries removed and a single hole created irrespective of whether the excluded area is itself made up of multiple service boundaries.</t>

      <t>It is considered likely that LoST servers will need to provide responses sufficiently quickly to allow real-time queries to be performed as part of an emergency call routing flow.  It is for this reason that databases supporting native geospatial query techniques are desirable and that service boundary specifications that are easily mapped to internal data structures are preferred.  Using interior boundaries makes support for this operation easy, while allowing an arbitrary number of holes in a service boundary to be specified.
      </t>

      <t>Each polygon is stored in the geospatial database and mapped to a service URN and destination URI.  Many geospatial databases natively support polygons with interior exclusions.  Without native support, interior boundaries can be stored against the polygon and can checked separately.  A location falls within the area described by a polygon if it is within the exterior boundary and not within any interior boundary.
      </t>

      <t>In the above example, if a location falls within the interior boundary, it maps to the "Inner Area Police" service; likewise, if a location falls within the exterior boundary, but not within the interior boundary, it maps to the "Outer Area Police" service.

      <t>Constraining the form of a polygon representation as described in this document does not introduce new security considerations.
      </t>
<!--      <t>However, using polygons to describe LoST service boundaries can have the following concerns:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Precise service boundaries with holes can have large numbers of points.  This results in LoST responses of significant size and complexity.
        </t>

        <t>A LoST server might not want to reveal service boundaries to clients.
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>Both these cases can be addressed by providing smaller, simpler service boundary polygon in LoST responses.  This smaller polygon MUST fit within the actual service boundary.  This is possible because a LoST server is not required to provide a precise service boundary.  The service boundary need only indicate an area within which the service mapping does not change.

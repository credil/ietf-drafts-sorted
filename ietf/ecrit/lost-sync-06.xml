            <t>The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol is an XML-based protocol for
                mapping service identifiers and geodetic or civic location information to service
                URIs and service boundaries. In particular, it can be used to determine the
                location-appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for emergency services. </t>
            <t>The main data structure, the &lt;mapping&gt; element, used for encapsulating
                information about service boundaries is defined in the LoST protocol specification
                and circumscribes the region within which all locations map to the same service
                Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or set of URIs for a given service.</t>
            <t>This document defines an XML protocol to exchange these mappings between two nodes.
                This mechanism can be used for bulk exchange of &lt;mapping&gt; elements
                between two entities. As such, this document can also be used without the LoST
                protocol. </t>

            <t>The <xref target="RFC5222">LoST (Location-to-Service Translation) protocol</xref>
                maps service identifiers and geodetic or civic location information to service URIs.
                The main data structure, the &lt;mapping&gt; element, used for encapsulating
                information about service boundaries is defined in the LoST protocol specification

                Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or set of URIs for a given service.</t>

            <t>This document enables a bulk exchange of &lt;mapping&gt; elements between two
                entities (the LoST Sync client and the LoST Sync server). </t>
            <t>
                <list style="empty">
                    <t> The LoST Sync mechanism can, for example, be used in the LoST architecture,
                        as specified in the <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-mapping-arch"/>. There,
                        LoST servers act in different roles that cooperate to provide an ubiquitous,
                        globally scalable and resilient mapping service. In the LoST mapping
                        architecture, servers can peer, i.e., have an on-going data exchange
                        relationship. Peering relationships are set up manually, based on local
                        policies. A server can peer with any number of other servers. Forest guides
                        peer with other forest guides; resolvers peer with forest guides and other
                        resolvers (in the same cluster); authoritative mapping servers peer with
                        forest guides and other authoritative servers, either in the same cluster or
                        above or below them in the tree. Authoritative mapping servers push coverage
                        regions "up" the tree, i.e., from child nodes to parent nodes. The child
                        informs the parent of the geospatial or civic region that it covers for a
                        specific service.</t>
                </list>
            </t>

            <t>This document defines two types of exchanges and those are best described by the
                exchange between two nodes as shown in <xref target="overview1"/> and <xref
                    target="overview2"/>. The protocol exchange always runs between a LoST Sync
                client and a LoST Sync server even through the roles are reversed for the two
                available exchanges and logically the two nodes might often be peers rather than in a
                client-server relationship. Node A in the example of <xref
                    target="overview1"/> and <xref target="overview2"/> has mappings that Node B is
                going to retrieve. </t>

            <t> The &lt;getMappingsRequest> and &lt;getMappingsResponse> exchange allows a
                LoST Sync client to request mappings from a LoST Sync server.<figure

            <t> The &lt;pushMappingsRequest> and &lt;pushMappingsResponse> exchange allows a
                LoST Sync client to push mappings to LoST Sync server. The assumption is being made
                that Node A and B have previously been configured in a way that they push mappings
                in such a fashion and that Node A maintains state about the mappings that have to be
                pushed to Node B. No subscribe mechanism is defined in this document that
                would allow Node B to tell Node A about what mappings it is interested. <figure

            <section title="LoST Sync Client's Behavior">

                <t>A LoST Sync client has two ways to retrieve mapping elements from a LoST Sync
                    server node. </t>
                <t>
                    <list style="numbers">
                        <t>A mechanisms that is suitable when no mappings are available on the
                            client side is to submit an empty &lt;getMappingsRequest> message,
                            as shown in <xref target="empty-request"/>. The intent by the LoST Sync client
                            thereby is to retrieve all mappings from the LoST Sync server. 
                            Note that the request does not
                            propagate further to other nodes.</t>

                        <t>A client that has already obtained mappings in previous exchanges may
                            want to check whether these mappings have been updated in the meanwhile.
                            The policy when to poll for updated mapping information is outside the
                            scope of this document. The &lt;getMappingsRequest> message with one
                            or multiple &lt;exists&gt; child element(s) allows to reduce the
                            number of returned mappings to those that have been updated and also to
                            those that are missing. </t>
                    </list>
                </t>

                <t>In response to the &lt;getMappingsRequest> message the client waits for the
                    &lt;getMappingsResponse> message. In case of a successful response the
                    client stores the received mappings and determines which mappings to
                replace.</t>
            </section>


            <section title="LoST Sync Server's Behavior">

                <t>When a LoST Sync server receives an empty &lt;getMappingsRequest> message
                    then all locally available mappings MUST be returned (assuming that the client
                    has been properly authenticated and authorized).</t>

                <t>When a LoST Sync server receives a &lt;getMappingsRequest> message with one
                    or multiple &lt;exists&gt; child element(s) then it MUST consult with
                    the local mapping database to determine whether any of the mappings of the
                    client is stale and whether there are mappings locally that the client does not
                    yet have. The former can be determined by finding mappings corresponding to the
                    'source' and 'sourceID' attribut where a mapping with a more recent lastUpdated
                    date exists. </t>

                <t>Processing a &lt;getMappingsRequest> message MAY lead to a successful
                    response in the form of a &lt;getMappingsResponse> or an &lt;errors>
                    message. Only the &lt;badRequest>, &lt;forbidden>,
                    &lt;internalError>, &lt;serverTimeout> errors, defined in <xref
                        target="RFC5222"/>, are utilized by this specification. Neither the
                    &lt;redirect> nor the &lt;warnings> messages are reused by this
                message.</t>

            title="Pushing Mappings via &lt;pushMappings> and
&lt;pushMappingsResponse>">

            <section title="LoST Sync Client's Behavior">

                <t>When a LoST Sync node obtains new information that is of interest to its peers,
                    it MAY push the new mappings to its peers. Configuration settings at both peers
                    decide whether this functionality is used. New mappings may arrive through
                    non-LoST means, such as a manual addition to the local mappings database, or
                    through the interaction with other LoST nodes. Mappings may also be deleted and
                    this may trigger events.</t>

                <t>A sending node keeps track with which recipient it has exchanged mapping elements
                    with. As discussed in Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC5222"/>, mapping elements
                    are identified by the 'source', 'sourceID' and 'lastUpdated' attributes. A
                    mapping is considered the same if these three attributes match. It is RECOMMENDED not 
                    to push the same information to the same peer more than once.</t>

                <t>A LoST Sync client MUST send a &lt;pushMappings> request containing one or
                    more &lt;mapping> elements. </t>
                <t>To delete a mapping, the content of the mapping is left empty. The node can
                    delete the mapping from its internal mapping database, but has to remember which
                    peers it has distributed this update to. The 'expires' attribute is required,
                    but ignored. If an attempt is made to delete a non-existent mapping, the request
                    is silently ignored.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="LoST Sync Server's Behavior">
                <t>When a LoST Sync Server receives a &lt;pushMappingsRequest> message then a
                    newly received mapping M' MUST replace an existing mapping M if all of the
                    following conditions hold: <list style="numbers">
                        <t>M'.source equals M.source</t>
                        <t>M'.sourceID' equals M.sourceID</t>
                        <t>M'.lastUpdated greater than M.lastUpdated</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>If the received mapping M' does not update any existing mapping M then it MUST be
                    added to the local cache as an independent mapping.</t>
                <t>If a &lt;pushMappingsRequest> message with an empty &lt;mapping&gt;
                    element is received then a corresponding mapping has to be determined based on
                    the 'source', 'sourceID' and 'lastUpdated' attributes. If a mapping has been
                    found then it MUST be deleted. If no mapping can be identified then an
                    &lt;errors> response MUST be returned that contains the &lt;notDeleted>
                    child element. The &lt;notDeleted> element MAY carry a
                    &lt;message&gt; element and MUST contain the &lt;mapping&gt;
                    element(s) that caused the error.</t>
                <t>The response to a &lt;pushMappingsRequest> request is a
                    &lt;pushMappingsResponse> message. With this specification, a successful
                    response message returns no additional elements, whereas an &lt;errors>
                    response is returned in the response message, if the request failed. Only the
                    &lt;badRequest>, &lt;forbidden>, &lt;internalError> or
                    &lt;serverTimeout> errors defined in Section 13.1 of <xref target="RFC5222"
                    />, are used. The &lt;redirect> and &lt;warnings> messages are not used
                    for this query/response.</t>

                <t>If the set of nodes that are synchronizing their data does not form a tree, it is
                    possible that the same information arrives through several other nodes. This is
                    unavoidable, but generally only imposes a modest overhead. (It would be possible
                    to create a spanning tree in the same fashion as IP multicast, but the
                    complexity does not seem warranted, given the relatively low volume of
                data.)</t>

        <section title="Transport">
            <t> LoST Sync needs an underlying protocol transport mechanism to carry requests and
                responses. This document defines the use of LoST Sync over HTTP and LoST over
                HTTP-over-TLS. Client and server developers are reminded that full support of RFC
                2616 HTTP facilities is expected. If LoST Sync clients or servers re-implement HTTP,
                rather than using available servers or client code as a base, careful attention must
                be paid to full interoperability. Other transport mechanisms are left to future
                documents. The available transport mechanisms are determined through the use of the
                LoST U-NAPTR application. In protocols that support content type indication, LoST
                Sync uses the media type application/lostsync+xml.</t>

            <t>When using HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> and HTTP-over-TLS <xref target="RFC2818"/>,
                LoST Sync messages use the HTTP POST method. The HTTP request MUST use the
                Cache-Control response directive "no-cache" to HTTP-level caching even by caches
                that have been configured to return stale responses to client requests.</t>


            <t>All LoST Sync responses, including those indicating a LoST warning or error, are
                carried in 2xx responses, typically 200 (OK). Other 2xx responses, in particular 203
                (Non-authoritative information) may be returned by HTTP caches that disregard the
                caching instructions. 3xx, 4xx and 5xx HTTP response codes indicates that the HTTP
                request itself failed or was redirected; these responses do not contain any LoST
                Sync XML elements. </t>

            <t>The HTTP URL is derived from the LoST Sync server name via U-NAPTR application.</t>

      <t>For some location-based applications, such as emergency calling or roadside assistance, it
        appears that the identity of the requestor is less important than accurate and trustworthy
        location information. To ensure adequate help location has to be left untouched by the end
        point or by entities in transit.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t> Much of the focus in trustable networks has been on ensuring the reliability of personal
        identity information or verifying privileges. However, in some cases, access to trustworthy
        location information is more important than identity since some services are meant to be
        widely available, regardless of the identity of the requestor. Emergency services, such as
        fire department, ambulance and police, but also commercial services such as food delivery
        and roadside assistance are among those. Customers, competitors or emergency callers lie
        about their location to harm the service provider or to deny services to others, by tying up
        the service capacity. In addition, if third parties can modify the information, they can
        deny services to the requestor. </t>
      <t> Physical security is often based on location. As a trivial example, light switches in
        buildings are not typically protected by keycards or passwords, but are only accessible to
        those within the perimeter of the building. Merchants processing credit card payments
        already use location information to estimate the risk that a transaction is fraudulent,
        based on the HTTP client's IP address (that is then translated to location). In all these
        cases, trustworthy location information can be used to augment identity information or, in
        some cases, avoid the need for role-based authorization. </t>
      <t> A number of standardization organizations have developed mechanisms to make civic and
        geodetic location available to the end host. Examples for these protocols are LLDP-MED <xref
          target="LLDP-MED"/>, DHCP extensions (see <xref target="RFC4776"/>, <xref target="RFC3825"
        />), HELD <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>, or the protocols
        developed within the IEEE as part of their link-layer specifications. The server offering
        this information is usually called a Location Information Server (LIS). More common with
        high-quality cellular devices is the ability for the end host itself to determine its own
        location using GPS. The location information is then provided, by reference or value, to the
        service-providing entities, i.e. location recipients, via application protocols, such as
        HTTP, SIP or XMPP. </t>
      <t> This document investigates the security threats in <xref target="threats"/>, and outlines
        three solutions that are frequently mentioned in <xref target="solutions"/>. We use
        emergency services an example to illustrate the security problems, as the problems have been
        typically discussed in that context since the stakes are high, but the issues apply also to
        other examples as cited earlier. We also take a look at the operational considerations in
          <xref target="ops"/> since there is a cost associated with the estbalishment of the
        necessary infrastructure. With the pros of the available technology being described and the
        cons of the operational complexity highlighted we offer a conclusion in <xref
          target="conclusion"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>This document re-uses a lot of the terminology defined in Section 3 of <xref
          target="RFC5012"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Emergency Services">
      <t>Users of the legacy telephone network can summon emergency services such as ambulance, fire
        and police using a well-known emergency service number (e.g., 9-1-1 in North America, 1-1-2
        in Europe). Location information is used to route emergency calls to the appropriate
        regional Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) that serves the caller to dispatch first-level
        responders to the emergency site. </t>
      <t> Regulators have already started to demand emergency service support for voice over IP.
        However, enabling such critical public services using the Internet is challenging, as many
        of the assumptions of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) / public land mobile
        network (PLMN) no longer hold. In particular, while the local telephone company provides
        both the physical access and the phone service, VoIP allows and encourages to split these
        two roles between the Access Infrastructure Provider (AIP) and Application (Voice) Service
        Provider (VSP). The VSP may be located far away from the AIP and may either have no business
        relationship with that AIP or may be a competitor. It is also likely that the VSP will have
        no relationship with the PSAP and will therefore be unknown. </t>
    </section>

    <!-- *********************************************************************** -->

    <section anchor="threats" title="Threats">

      <t>IP-based emergency calling faces many security threats, most of which are well-known from
        other realms, such as protecting the privacy of communications or against denial-of-service
        attacks using packet flooding. Here, we focus specifically on a higher-layer threat that is
        unique to services where semi-anonymous users can request expensive services. </t>
      <t> Prank calls have been a problem for emergency services, dating back to the time of street
        corner call boxes. Individual prank calls waste emergency services and possibly endanger
        bystanders or emergency service personnel as they rush to the reported scene of a fire or
        accident. A more recent concern is that massive prank calls can be used to disrupt emergency
        services, e.g., during a mass-casualty event and thus be used as a means to amplify the
        effect of a terror attack, for example. </t>
      <t>Emergency services have three finite resources subject to denial of service attacks: the
        network and server infrastructure, call takers and dispatchers, and the first responders,
        such as fire fighters and police officers. Protecting the network infrastructure is similar
        to protecting other high-value service providers, except that trustworthy location
        information may be used to filter call setup requests, to weed out requests that are out of
        area. PSAPs even for large cities may only have a handful of PSAP call takers on duty, so
        even if they can, by questioning the caller, eliminate a lot of prank calls, they are
        quickly overwhelmed by even a small-scale attack. Finally, first responder resources are
        scarce, particularly during mass-casualty events. </t>
      <t> Currently, emergency services rely on the fact that location spoofing is difficult for
        normal users. Additionally, the identity of most callers can be ascertained, so that the
        threat of severe punishments reduces prank calls. Mechanically placing a large number of
        emergency calls that appear to come from different locations is also difficult. Calls from
        payphones are subject to greater scrutiny by the call taker. In the current system, it would
        be very difficult for an attacker from country 'Foo' to attack the emergency services
        infrastructure located in country 'Bar'. </t>
      <t> One of the main motivations of an adversary in the emergency services context is to
        prevent callers from utilizing emergency service support. This can be done by a variety of
        means, such as impersonating a PSAP or directory servers, attacking SIP signaling elements
        and location servers. </t>
      <t> Attackers may want to modify, prevent or delay emergency calls. In some cases, this will
        lead the PSAP to dispatch emergency personnel to an emergency that does not exist and,
        hence, the personnel might not be available to other callers. It might also be possible for
        an attacker to impede the users from reaching an appropriate PSAP by modifying the location
        of an end host or the information returned from the mapping protocol. In some countries,
        regulators may not require the authenticated identity of the emergency caller, as is true
        for PSTN-based emergency calls placed from payphones or SIM-less cell phones today.
        Furthermore, if identities can easily be crafted (as it is the case with many VoIP offerings
        today), then the value of emergency caller authentication itself might be limited. As a
        consequence, an attacker can forge emergency call information without the chance of being
        held accountable for its own actions.</t>
      <t> The above-mentioned attacks are mostly targeting individual emergency callers or a very
        small fraction of them. If attacks are, however, launched against the mapping architecture
        (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-mapping-arch"/> or against the emergency services IP
        network (including PSAPs), a larger region and a large number of potential emergency callers
        are affected. The call takers themselves are a particularly scarce resource and if human
        interaction by these call takers is required then this can very quickly have severe
        consequences.</t>
      <t>To provide a structured analysis we distinguish between three adversary models: </t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="External adversary model:"> The end host, e.g., an emergency caller whose
            location is going to be communicated, is honest and the adversary may be located between
            the end host and the location server or between the end host and the PSAP. None of the
            emergency service infrastructure elements act maliciously. </t>
          <t hangText="Malicious infrastructure adversary model:"> The emergency call routing
            elements, such as the LIS, the LoST infrastructure, used for mapping locations to PSAP
            address, or call routing elements, may act maliciously. </t>
          <t hangText="Malicious end host adversary model:"> The end host itself acts maliciously,
            whether the owner is aware of this or whether it is acting as a bot.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>We will focus only on the malicious end host adversary model since it follows today's most
        common adversary model on the Internet that includes bot nets. </t>

      <section title="Location Spoofing">
        <t> An adversary can provide false location information in order to fool the emergency
          personnel. Such an attack is particularly easy if location information is attached to the
          emergency call by the end host and is either not verified or cannot be verified by anyone.
          Only entities that are close to the caller can verify the correctness of location
          information. Another form of this attack is to fool a VSP (and indirectly a LIS) in using
          a wrong identity (such as an IP address) for the location lookup. This type of attack can
          be accomplished in the PSTN today with the help of caller-id spoofing. </t>
        <t> The following list presents threats specific to location information handling: </t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Place shifting:"> Trudy, the adversary, pretends to be at an arbitrary
              location. In some cases, place shifting can be limited in range, e.g., to the coverage
              area of a particular cell tower. </t>
            <t hangText="Time shifting:">Trudy pretends to be at a location she was a while ago.</t>
            <t hangText="Location theft:"> Trudy observes Alice's location and replays it as her
              own.</t>
            <t hangText="Location swapping:">Trudy and Malory, located in different locations, can
              collude and swap location information and pretend to be in each other's location.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Call Identity Spoofing">
        <t> If an adversary can place emergency calls without disclosing its identity, then prank
          calls are more difficult to be traced. There are at least two different forms of
          authentication in this context: (a) network access authentication (e.g., using the
          Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) <xref target="RFC3748"/> and (b) authentication
          of the emergency caller at the VoIP application layer. This differentiation is created by
          the split between the AIP and the VSP. Note that different identities are involved and
          that the are also managed by different parties and thus making the linkage between the two
          quite difficult.</t>
        <t> Trying to find an adversary that did not authenticate itself to the VSP is difficult
          even though there is still a chance if network access authentication was executed. If
          there is no authentication (neither to the PSAP, to the VSP nor to the AIP) then it is
          very challenging to trace the call back in order to a make a particular entity
          accountable. This might, for example, be the case with an open IEEE 802.11 WLAN access
          point even if the owner of the access point can be determined. </t>
        <t> However, unlike for the existing telephone system, it is possible to imagine that VoIP
          emergency calls could require strong identity, as providing such identity information is
          not necessarily coupled to having a business relationship with the AIP, ISP or VSP.
          However, due to the time-critical nature of emergency calls, it is unlikely that
          multi-layers authentication can be used, so that in most cases, only the device placing
          the call will be able to be identified, making the system vulnerable to botnet attacks.
          Furthermore, deploying additional credentials for emergency service purposes, such as
          dedicated certificates, increases costs, introduces a significant administrative overhead
          and is only useful if widely used. </t>

    <section anchor="solutions" title="Solution Proposals">

      <t> This section presents three solution approaches that have been discussed in order to
        mitigate the threats discussed. </t>

      <section title="Location Signing">
        <t> One way to avoid location spoofing is to let a trusted location server sign the location
          information before it is sent to the end host, i.e., the entity subject to the location
          determination process. The signed location information is then verified by the location
          recipient and not by the target. <xref target="fig1"/> shows the communication model with
          the target requesting signed location in step (a), the location server returns it in step
          (b) and it is then conveyed to the location recipient in step (c) who verifies it. For
          SIP, the procedures described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"/> are
          applicable for location conveyance. </t>
        <t>
          <figure anchor="fig1" title="Location Signing">

          </figure>
        </t>

        <t>Additional information, such as timestamps or expiration times, has to be included
          together with the signed location to limit replay attacks. If the location is retrieved
          from a location server, even a stationary end host has to periodically obtain a fresh
          signed location, or incur the additional delay of querying during the emergency call. </t>
        <t> Bot nets are also unlikely to be deterred by location signing. However, accurate
          location information would limit the usable subset of the bot net, as only hosts within
          the PSAP serving area would be useful in placing calls. </t>
        <t> To prevent location-swapping attacks it is necessary to include some some target
          specific identity information. The included information depends on the purpose, namely
          either real-time verification by the location recipient or for the purpose of a
          post-mortem analysis when the location recipient wants to determine the legal entity
          behind the target for prosecution (if this is possible). As argued in <xref target="ops"/>
          the operational considerations make a real-time verification difficult. A strawman
          proposal for location signing is provided by <xref
            target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-location-dependability"/>. </t>
        <t> Still, for large-scale attacks launched by bot nets, this is unlikely to be helpful.
          Location signing is also difficult when the host provides its own location via GPS, which
          is likely to be a common occurrence for mobile devices. Trusted computing approaches, with
          tamper-proof GPS modules, may be needed in that case. After all, a device can always
          pretend to have a GPS device and the recipient has no way of verifying this or forcing
          disclosure of non-GPS-derived location information. </t>
        <t> Location verification may be most useful if it is used in conjunction with other
          mechanisms. For example, a call taker can verify that the region that corresponds to the
          IP address of the media stream roughly corresponds to the location information reported by
          the caller. To make the use of bot nets more difficult, a CAPTCHA-style test may be
          applied to suspicious calls, although this idea is quite controversial for emergency
          services, at the danger of delaying or even rejecting valid calls. </t>

      <section title="Location by Reference">
        <t> The location-by-reference concept was developed so that end hosts could avoid having to
          periodically query the location server for up-to-date location information in a mobile
          environment. Additionally, if operators do not want to disclose location information to
          the end host without charging them, location-by-reference provides a reasonable
          alternative.</t>

          reference in step (a), the location server returns the reference in step (b), and it is
          then conveyed to the location recipient in step (c). The location recipient needs to
          resolve the reference with a request in step (d). Finally, location information is

        <t> The details for the dereferencing operations vary with the type of reference, such as a
          HTTP, HTTPS, SIP, SIPS URI or a SIP presence URI. HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/> is an example of a protocol
          that is able to return such references. </t>
        <t> For location-by-reference, the location server needs to maintain one or several URIs for
          each target, timing out these URIs after a certain amount of time. References need to
          expire to prevent the recipient of such a URL from being able to permanently track a host
          and to offer garbage collection functionality for the location server. </t>
        <t> Off-path adversaries must be prevented from obtaining the target's location. The
          reference contains a randomized component that prevents third parties from guessing it.
          When the location recipient fetches up-to-date location information from the location
          server, it can also be assured that the location information is fresh and not replayed.
          However, this does not address location swapping. </t>
        <t> However, location-by-reference does not offer significant security benefits if the end
          host uses GPS to determine its location. At best, a network provider can use cell tower or
          triangulation information to limit the inaccuracy of user-provided location information.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Proxy Adding Location">
        <t> Instead of making location information available to the end host, it is possible to
          allow an entity in the AIP, or associated with the AIP, to retrieve the location
          information on behalf of the end point. This solution is possible when the application
          layer messages are routed through an entity with the ability to determine the location
          information of the end point, for example based on the end host's IP or MAC address. </t>
        <t> When the untrustworthy end host does not have the ability to access location
          information, it cannot modify it either. Proxies can use various authentication security
          techniques, including SIP Identity <xref target="RFC4474"/>, to ensure that modifications
          to the location in transit can be detected by the location recipient (e.g., the PSAP). As
          noted above, this is unlikely to work for GPS-based location determination techniques. </t>
        <t> The obvious disadvantage of this approach is that there is a need to deploy application
          layer entities, such as SIP proxies, at AIPs or associated with AIPs. This requires a
          standardized VoIP profile to be deployed at every end device and at every AIP, for
          example, based on SIP. This might impose a certain interoperability challenge.
          Additionally, the AIP more or less takes the responsibility for emergency calls, even for
          customers they have no direct or indirect relationship with. To provide identity
          information about the emergency caller from the VSP it would be necessary to let the AIP
          and the VSP to interact for authentication (see, for example, <xref target="RFC4740"/>).
          This interaction along the Authentication, Authorization and Accounting infrastructure
          (see ) is often based on business relationships between the involved entities. The AIP and
          the VSP are very likely to have no such business relationship, particularly when talking
          about an arbitrary VSP somewhere on the Internet. In case that the interaction between the
          AIP and the VSP fails due to the lack of a business relationship then the procedures
          described in <xref target="I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-unauthenticated-access"/> are applicable
          and typically a fall-back would be provided where no emergency caller identity information
          is made available to the PSAP and the emergency call still has to be completed. </t>

    <section anchor="ops" title="Operations Considerations">

      <section title="Attribution to a Specific Trusted Source">
        <t>
          <xref target="NENA-i2"/> Section 3.7 describes some of the aspects of attribution as
          follows: <list style="empty">
            <t> The i2 solution proposes a Location Information Server (LIS) be the source for
              distributing location information within an access network. Furthermore the validity,
              integrity and authenticity of this information are directly attributed to the LIS
              operator. </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t><xref target="validity"/> describes the issues that arise in ensuring the validity of
          location information provided by the LIS operator. <xref target="signing"/> and <xref
            target="reference"/> describe operational issues that arise in ensuring the integrity
          and authenticity of location information provided by the LIS operator. </t>

        <section anchor="validity" title="Validity">
          <t> In existing networks where location information is both determined by the access/voice
            service provider as well as communicated by the AIP/VSP, responsibility for location
            validity can be attributed entirely to a single party, namely the AIP/VSP. </t>
          <t> However, on the Internet, not only may the AIP and VSP represent different parties,
            but location determination may depend on information contributed by parties trusted by
            neither the AIP nor VSP, or even the operator of the Location Information Server (LIS).
            In such circumstances, mechanisms for enhancing the integrity or authenticity of
            location data contribute little toward ensuring the validity of that data. </t>
          <t> It should be understood that the means by which location is determined may not
            necessarily relate to the means by which the endpoint communicates with the LIS. Just
            because a Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) operates at a particular layer does not
            imply that the location data communicated by that protocol is derived solely based on
            information obtained at that layer. In some circumstances, LCP implementations may base
            their location determination on information gathered from a variety of sources which may
            merit varying levels of trust, such as information obtained from the calling endpoint,
            or wiremap information that is time consuming to verify or may rapidly go out of date. </t>
          <t>For example, consider the case of a Location Information Server (LIS) that utilizes
            LLDP-MED <xref target="LLDP-MED"/> endpoint move detection notifications in determining
            calling endpoint location. Regardless of whether the LIS implementation utilizes an LCP
            operating above the link layer (such as an application layer protocol such as HELD <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>), the validity of the location
            information conveyed would be dependent on the security properties of LLDP-MED. </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="LLDP-MED"/> Section 13.3 defines the endpoint move detection notification
            as follows: </t>

]]></artwork>
            </figure>
          </t>
          <t> As noted in Section 7.4 of <xref target="LLDP-MED"/>, the lldpRemChassisIdSubtype,
            lldpRemChassisId and lldpXMedRemDeviceClass variables are determined from the Chassis ID
            (1) and LLDP-MED Device Type Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuples provided within the LLDP
            advertisement of the calling device. As noted in <xref target="LLDP-MED"/> Section
            9.2.3, all Endpoint Devices use the Network address ID subtype (5) by default. In order
            to provide topology change notifications in a timely way, it cannot necessarily be
            assumed that a Network Connectivity devices will validate the network address prior to
            transmission of the move detection notification. As a result, there is no guarantee that
            the network address reported by the endpoint will correspond to that utilized by the
            device. </t>
          <t> The discrepancy need not be due to nefarious reasons. For example, an IPv6-capable
            endpoint may utilize multiple IPv6 addresses. Similarly, an IPv4-capable endpoint may
            initially utilize a Link- Local IPv4 address <xref target="RFC3927"/> and then may
            subsequently acquire a DHCP-assigned routable address. All addresses utilized by the
            endpoint device may not be advertised in LLDP, or even if they are, endpoint move
            detection notification may not be triggered, either because no LinkUp/LinkDown
            notifications occur (e.g. the host adds or changes an address without rebooting) or
            because these notifications were not detectable by the Network Connectivity device (the
            endpoint device was connected to a hub rather than directly to a switch). </t>
          <t>Similar issues may arise in situations where the LIS utilizes DHCP lease data to obtain
            location information. Where the endpoint address was not obtained via DHCP (such as via
            manual assignment, stateless autoconfiguration <xref target="RFC4862"/> or Link-Local
            IPv4 self- assignment), no lease information will be available to enable determination
            of device location. This situation should be expected to become increasingly common as
            IPv6-capable endpoints are deployed, and Location Configuration Protocol (LCP)
            interactions occur over IPv6. </t>
          <t> Even in scenarios in which the LIS relies on location data obtained from the IP MIB
              <xref target="RFC4293"/> and the Bridge MIB <xref target="RFC4188"/>, availability of
            location determination information is not assured. In an enterprise scale network,
            maintenance of current location information depends on the ability of the management
            station to retrieve data via polling of network devices. As the number of devices
            increases, constraints of network latency and packet loss may make it increasingly
            difficult to ensure that all devices are polled on a sufficiently frequent interval. In
            addition, in large networks, it is likely that tables will be large so that when UDP
            transport is used, query responses will fragment, resulting in increasing packet loss or
            even difficulties in firewall or NAT traversal. </t>
          <t> Furthermore, even in situations where the location data can be presumed to exist and
            be valid, there may be issues with the integrity of the retrieval process. For example,
            where the LIS depends on location information obtained from a MIB notification or query,
            unless SNMPv3 <xref target="RFC3411"/> is used, data integrity and authenticity is not
            assured in transit between the network connectivity device and the LIS. </t>
          <t> From these examples, it should be clear that the availability or validity of location
            data is a property of the LIS system design and implementation rather than an inherent
            property of the LCP. As a result, mechanisms utilized to protect the integrity and
            authenticity of location data do not necessarily provide assurances relating to the
            validity or provenance of that data. </t>

        <section anchor="signing" title="Location Signing">
          <t>
            <xref target="NENA-i2"/> Section 3.7 includes recommendations relating to location
            signing: <list style="empty">
              <t> Location determination is out of scope for NENA, but we can offer guidance on what
                should be considered when designing mechanisms to report location: </t>
              <t> 1. The location object should be digitally signed. </t>
              <t> 2. The certificate for the signer (LIS operator) should be rooted in VESA. For
                this purpose, VPC and ERDB operators should issue certs to LIS operators. </t>
              <t> 3. The signature should include a timestamp. </t>
              <t> 4. Where possible, the Location Object should be refreshed periodically, with the
                signature (and thus the timestamp) being refreshed as a consequence. </t>
              <t> 5. Antispoofing mechanisms should be applied to the Location Reporting method.
              </t>
            </list> [Note: The term Valid Emergency Services Authority (VESA) refers to the root
            certificate authority.] </t>
          <t> Signing of location objects implies the development of a trust hierarchy that would
            enable a certificate chain provided by the LIS operator to be verified by the PSAP.
            Rooting the trust hierarchy in VESA can be accomplished either by having the VESA
            directly sign the LIS certificates, or by the creation of intermediate CAs certified by
            the VESA, which will then issue certificates to the LIS. In terms of the workload
            imposed on the VESA, the latter approach is highly preferable. However, this raises the
            question of who would operate the intermediate CAs and what the expectations would be.</t>
          <t> In particular, the question arises as to the requirements for LIS certificate
            issuance, and whether they are significantly different from say, requirements for
            issuance of an SSL/TLS web certificate. </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="reference" title="Location by Reference">
          <t> Where location by reference is provided, the recipient needs to deference the LbyR in
            order to obtain location. With the introduction of location by reference concept two
            authorization models were developed, see <xref
              target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-deref-protocol"/>, namely the "Authorization by
            Possession" and "Authorization via Access Control Lists" model. With the "Authorization
            by Possession" model everyone in possession of the reference is able to obtain the
            corresponding location information. This might, however, be incompatible with other
            requirements typically imposed by AIPs, such as location hiding (see <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-location-hiding-req"/>). As such, the "Authorization via Access
            Control Lists" model is likely to be the preferred model for many AIPs and subject for
            discussion in the subsequent paragraphs.</t>
          <t> Just as with PIDF-LO signing, the operational considerations in managing credentials
            for use in LbyR dereferencing can be considerable without the introduction of some kind
            of hierarchy. It does not seem reasonable for a PSAP to manage client certificates or
            Digest credentials for all the LISes in its coverage area, so as to enable it to
            successfully dereference LbyRs. In some respects, this issue is even more formidable
            than the validation of signed PIDF- LOs. While PIDF-LO signing credentials are provided
            to the LIS operator, in the case of de-referencing, the PSAP needs to be obtain
            credentials compatible with the LIS configuration, a potentially more complex
            operational problem. </t>
          <t> As with PIDF-LO signing, the operational issues of LbyR can be addressed to some
            extent by introduction of hierarchy. Rather than requiring the PSAP to obtain
            credentials for accessing each LIS, the local LIS could be required to upload location
            information to location aggregation points who would in turn manage the relationships
            with the PSAP. This would shift the management burden from the PSAPs to the location
            aggregation points. </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Application to a Specific Point in Time">
        <t> PIDF-LO objects contain a timestamp, which reflects the time at which the location was
          determined. Even if the PIDF-LO is signed, the timestamp only represents an assertion by
          the LIS, which may or may not be trustworthy. For example, the recipient of the signed
          PIDF-LO may not know whether the LIS supports time synchronization, or whether it is
          possible to reset the LIS clock manually without detection. Even if the timestamp was
          valid at the time location was determined, a time period may elapse between when the
          PIDF-LO was provided and when it is conveyed to the recipient. Periodically refreshing
          location information to renew the timestamp even though the location information itself is
          unchanged puts additional load on LISs. As a result, recipients need to validate the
          timestamp in order to determine whether it is credible.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Linkage to a Specific Endpoint">
        <t> As noted in the "HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)" <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/> Section 6.6: <list style="empty">
            <t> The LIS MUST NOT include any means of identifying the Device in the PIDF-LO unless
              it is able to verify that the identifier is correct and inclusion of identity is
              expressly permitted by a Rule Maker. Therefore, PIDF parameters that contain identity
              are either omitted or contain unlinked pseudonyms <xref target="RFC3693"/>. A unique,
              unlinked presentity URI SHOULD be generated by the LIS for the mandatory presence
              "entity" attribute of the PIDF document. Optional parameters such as the "contact"
              element and the "deviceID" element <xref target="RFC4479"/> are not used. </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Given the restrictions on inclusion of identification information within the PIDF-LO, it
          may not be possible for a recipient to verify that the entity on whose behalf location was
          determined represents the same entity conveying location to the recipient. </t>
        <t> Where "Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation
          Protocol (SIP)" <xref target="RFC4474"/> is used, it is possible for the recipient to
          verify the identity assertion in the From: header. However, if PIDF parameters that
          contain identity are omitted or contain an unlinked pseudonym, then it may not be possible
          for the recipient to verify whether the conveyed location actually relates to the entity
          identified in the From: header. </t>

        <t> This lack of binding between the entity obtaining the PIDF-LO and the entity conveying
          the PIDF-LO to the recipient enables cut and paste attacks which would enable an attacker
          to assert a bogus location, even where both the SIP message and PIDF-LO are signed. As a
          result, even implementation of both <xref target="RFC4474"/> and location signing does not
          guarantee that location can be tied to a specific endpoint. </t>

      <t> Emergency services raise a number of architectural questions, see <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"/>, <xref
          target="I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-unauthenticated-access"/>, <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-location-hiding-req"/>, and <xref
          target="I-D.tschofenig-ecrit-architecture-overview"/>. With the generalized emergency
        architecture considered within the ECRIT working group various security challenges need to
        be addressed, including the ability to report faked location and other attacks against the
        emergency services infrastructure. These types of attacks also show that the attack
        characteristics play an important role when dealing with the problems and lower-layer
        solutions, as they have been proposed as solutions for Denial of Service prevention (for
        example using cryptographic puzzles), have limited applicability. </t>
      <t>Although it is important to ensure that location information cannot be faked there will be
        a larger number of GPS-enabled devices out there that make it difficult to utilize any of
        the security mechanisms described in <xref target="solutions"/>. It will be very unlikely
        that end users will upload their location information for "verification" to a nearby
        location server located in the access network.</t>
      <t> Given the practical and operational limitations in the technology, it may be worthwhile to
        consider whether the goals of trustworthy location, as for example defined by NENA i2 <xref
          target="NENA-i2"/>, are attainable, or whether lesser goals (such as auditability) should
        be substituted instead.</t>
      <t> The goal of auditability is to enable an investigator to determine the source of a rogue
        emergency call after the fact. Since such an investigation can rely on audit logs provided
        under court order, the information available to the investigator could be considerably
        greater than that present in messages conveyed in the emergency call. As a consequence the
        emergency caller becomes accountable for his actions. For example, in such a situation,
        information relating to the owner of the unlinked pseudonym could be provided to
        investigators, enabling them to unravel the chain of events that lead to the attack.
        Auditability is likely to be of most benefits in situations where attacks on the emergency
        services system are likely to be relatively infrequent, since the resources required to
        pursue an investigation are likely to be considerable. </t>
      <t> Where attacks are frequent and continuous, a reliance on non-automated mechanisms is
        unlikely to be satisfactory. As such, mechanisms to exchange audit trails information in a
        standardized format between ISPs and PSAPs / VSPs and PSAPs or heuristics to distinguish
        potentially fraudulent emergency calls from real emergencies might be valuable for the
        emergency services community. </t>

<section title="Introduction">

      <t>DECADE (DECoupled Application Data Enroute) is an architecture
      that provides applications with access to in-network storage. With access
      to in-network storage, content distribution applications can be designed
      to place less load on network infrastructure, such as last-mile links.
      See <xref target="I-D.ietf-decade-problem-statement"/> for further discussion.</t>  

      <t>A major motivation for DECADE is the substantial increase of
      capacity and reduction in cost offered by storage systems. For example,
      over the last two decades, there has been at least a 30-fold increase in
      the amount of storage that you can get for a given price (for flash memory
      and hard disk drives) <xref target="StorageTrends_1"/>, <xref target="StorageTrends_2"/>.</t>

      <t>High-capacity and low-cost in-network storage devices
      introduces substantial opportunities. One example of in-network
      storage is content caches supporting Web and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
      content. Different from existing content caches whose control
      fully reside at the owners of the caching devices, DECADE also
      allows applications to control access to their allocated
      in-network storage, as well as the resources consumed while
      accessing that storage (bandwidth, connections, storage
      space). While designed in the context of P2P applications, it
      may be useful to other applications as well.  This document
      provides details on deployed and experimental in-network storage
      solutions, and evaluates their suitability for DECADE.</t>
      
      <t>We note that the survey presented in this document is
      only representative of the research in this area. Rather than
      trying to enumerate an exhaustive list, we have chosen some
      typical techniques that lead to derivative works.</t>

<section title="Survey Overview">
    
      <section title="Terminology and Concepts" toc="default">
        <t>This document uses terms defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-decade-problem-statement"/>.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Historical Context">
      
        <t>In-network storage has been used previously in numerous scenarios to
reduce network traffic and enable more efficient content distribution.
This section presents a brief history of content distribution techniques
and illustrates how DECADE relates to past approaches.
Systems have been developed with particular use cases in mind.  Thus, this
survey is not meant to point out shortcomings of existing solutions, but rather
to indicate where certain capabilities required in DECADE <xref target="I-D.ietf-decade-reqs"/>
are not provided by existing systems.</t>

        <t>In the early stage of Internet development, most Web content was
stored at a central server and clients requested Web content from the central
server. In this architecture, the central server was required to provide a large
amount of bandwidth.  Web browsing is still a primary activity on today's
Internet. As more and more users access Web content, a central server can become
overloaded. The use of web caches is one technique to reduce load on a central
server. Web caches store frequently-requested content, and provide bandwidth for
serving the content to clients.</t>

        <t>The ongoing growth of broadband technology in the worldwide market
has been driven by the hunger of customers for new multimedia services as well
as Web content. In particular, the use of audio and video streaming formats has
become common for delivery of rich information to the public - both residential
and business.</t>
      
        <t> To overcome this challenge of massive multimedia consumption, just
installing more Web cache will not be enough. Moving content closer to the
consumer results in greater network efficiency, improved QoS, and lower latency,
while facilitating personalization of content through broadband content
applications. In these edge technologies, CDN is a representative technique.
Content Delivery Networks (CDN) are based on a large-scale distributed network of
servers located closer to the edges of the Internet for efficient delivery of
digital content including various forms of multimedia content.</t>

        <t>Although CDN is an effective means of information access and
delivery, there are two barriers to making CDN a more common service: cost and
replication integrity. Deploying a CDN for publicly available content is
expensive. It requires administrative control over nodes with large storage
capacity at geographically dispersed locations with adequate connectivity. CDN
can be scalable, but due to this administrative and cost overhead, not rapidly
deployable for the common user.</t>

        <t>The emergence and maturation of P2P has allowed
improvements to many network applications. P2P allows the use of client
resources, such as CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth, for serving content.
This can reduce the amount of resources required by a content provider.
Multimedia content delivery using various P2P or peer-assisted
frameworks has been shown to greatly reduce the dependence on CDN and central
content servers. However, the popularity of P2P applications has resulted in
increased traffic on ISP networks. P2P caches (both transparent and non-transparent)
have been introduced as a way to reduce the burden.  Though they can be effective
in reducing traffic in certain areas of ISP networks, P2P caches have their
shortcomings. In particular, they are application-dependent and thus difficult
to keep up-to-date with new and evolving P2P application protocols.  Second,
applications may benefit from explicit control of in-network storage, which
P2P caches do not provided. See <xref target="I-D.ietf-decade-problem-statement"/> for further
discussion.</t>


        <t>DECADE aims to provide a standard protocol allowing P2P applications
(including Content Providers) to make use of in-network storage to reduce the
traffic burden on ISP networks, while enabling P2P applications to control
access to content they have placed in in-network storage.</t>

<section title="In-network Storage System Components">
      
        <t>Before surveying individual technologies, we describe the basic components
	       	of in-network storage.  For consistency and for ease of comparison,
	       	we use the same model to evaluate each storage technology
	       	in this document.</t>

        <t>Note that the network protocol(s) used by a given storage system are also 
		an important part of the design.  We omit details of particular protocol
	       	choices in this document.</t>

        <section title="Data Access Interface">
         
          <t>A set of operations available to a client user for accessing data in the in-network
		  storage.  Solutions typically allow both read and write, though the mechanisms
		  for doing so can differ drastically.</t>
          
        </section>
        
        <section title="Data Management Operations">
        
          <t>Storage systems may provide users the ability to manage stored content.  
		  For example, operations such as delete and move may be provided to users.
		  In this survey, we focus on data management operations that are provided
		  to client users and omit those provided to system administrators.</t>
          
        </section>

        <section title="Data Search Capability">
         
          <t>Some storage systems may provide the capability to search or enumerate content
		  that has been stored. In this survey, we focus on search capabilities that
		  are provided to client users and omit those provided to system administrators.  
		  An example of a client search would be to find out the list of items stored
		  by the given user over a given period of time.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Access Control Authorization">
        
		<t>Storage systems typically allow a client user, content owner or some other entity to define
			the access policies for the in-network storage. The in-network storage
		       	system then checks the authorization of a user before it stores or retrieves content.
			We define three types of access control authorization: 
			public-unrestricted, public-restricted, and private.</t>

		<t> Public-unrestricted refers to content on an in-network storage system that is widely
			available to all clients (i.e., without restrictions).  An example is accessing 
			Wikipedia on the Web, or anonymous access to FTP sites.</t>
	
	        <t> Public-restricted refers to content on an in-network storage system that is available to
			a restricted (though still potentially large) set of clients, but which do not
			require any confidential credentials from the client.  An example is some 
			content (e.g., a TV show episode) on the Internet that can only
		       	be viewable in selected countries or networks (i.e., white/black lists or black-out areas).</t>

		<t> Private refers to content on an in-network storage system that is only made available
			to one or more clients presenting the required confidential credentials
			(e.g., password or key).  This content is not available to anyone without the proper
		       	confidential access credentials.</t>		

		<t> Note that a combination of access control types may be applicable for a given scenario.
		       	For example, the retrieval (read) of content from an in-network storage system may be
		       	public-unrestricted, but the storage (write) to the same system may be private.</t>

        </section>
        
        <section title="Resource Control Interface">
        
		<t>This is the interface through which users manage the resources on 
			in-network storage that can be used by other peers, e.g., the 
			bandwidth or connections.  The storage system may also allow 
			users to indicate a time for which resources are granted.</t>
        
        </section>
        
        <section title="Discovery Mechanism">
        
		<t> Users use the discovery mechanism to find location of in-network storage,
		       	find access interface or resource control interface or other interfaces
		       	of in-network storage.</t>
        
        </section>
        
        <section title="Storage Mode">
        
          <t>Storage systems may use the following modes of storage: file system, 
            object-based, or block-based.</t>

	  <t>A file system typically organizes files into a hierarchical tree structure.
		  Each level of the hierarchy normally contains one or more directories each
		  with one or more files.  A file system may also be flat or use some other
		  organizing principle.</t>
	  
	  <t>We define an object-based storage mode as one which stores discrete chunks
            of data (e.g., IP datagrams or another type of aggregation useful to
            an application) without a pre-defined hierarchy or meta structure.</t>

          <t>We define a block-based storage mode as one which stores a raw
            sequence of bytes, with a client being able to read and/or write data at
            offsets within that sequence.  Data is typically accessed in blocks
            for efficiency. An common example for this storage mode is raw
            access to a hard disk.</t>

          <t>In this survey, we define
                  Storage Mode to refer to how data is structured within the system,
                  which may not be the same as how it is accessed by a client. For
                  example, a caching system may cache objects with hierarchical
                  names, but may internally use an object-based Storage
                  Mode.</t>

<section title="In-Network Storage Systems">
	<t>This section surveys in-network storage systems using the methodology defined above.  
		The survey includes some systems that are widely deployed today, some systems
		that are just being deployed, and some experimental/futuristic systems.  The 
		survey covers both traditional client-server architectures and P2P architectures.  
		The surveyed systems are listed in alphabetical order.  Also, for each
	       	system, a brief explanation is given of the relevance to DECADE.</t>

    <section title="Amazon S3" anchor="AmazonS3Overview">
    
	    <t>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) <xref target="AmazonS3"/> provides an online
		    storage service using web (HTTP) interfaces. Users create buckets, 
		    and each bucket can contain stored objects. Users are provided an interface
		    through which they can manage their buckets.  Amazon S3 is a popular backend
		    storage for other services.  Other related storage services is the Blob Service
		    provided by Windows Azure <xref target="Azure"/>, and the Google Storage
		    for Developers <xref target="GoogleStorage"/>.
	    </t>

      <section title="Applicability to DECADE">
	      <t>Very widely used (deployed) example of in-network storage.  Amazon leases the storage
		      to third party companies for disparate services.  In particular, Amazon S3 has
	              a rich model for authorization (using signed queries) to integrate with a wide
	              variety of use cases.  A focus for Amazon S3 is scalability.  Particular
	              simplifications that were made are the absence of a general, hierarchical
	              namespace and the inability to update the contents of existing data.</t>

		      other Amazon Web Service users, all Amazon Web Service Users, or open to
		      all users (anonymous access). Another option is for the owner to generate

    <section title="BranchCache">

      <t>BranchCache <xref target="BranchCache"/> is a feature
	      integrated into Windows (Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008R2) that
	      aims to optimize enterprise branch office file access over the WAN
	      links. The main goals are to reduce WAN link utilization and improve
	      application responsiveness by caching and sharing content within a branch
	      while still maintaining end-to-end security. BranchCache allows files
	      retrieved from the web servers and file servers located in headquarters
	      or datacenters to be cached in remote branch offices, and shared among
	      users in the same branch accessing the same content.  BranchCache operates
	      transparently by instrumenting the HTTP and SMB components of the 
	      networking stack. It provides two modes of operation: Distributed Cache
	      and Hosted Cache.</t>

      <t>In both modes, a client always contacts a BranchCache-enabled content server
	      first to get the content identifiers for local search. If the content is
	      cached locally, the client then retrieves the content within the branch.
	      Otherwise, the client will go back to the original content server to 
	      request the content. The two modes differ in how the content is shared.</t>

      <t>In the Hosted Cache mode, a locally provisioned server acts as a cache for files
	      retrieved from the servers. After getting the content identifiers, the client
	      first consults the cache for the desired file. If it is not present in the 
	      cache, the client retrieves it from the content server and sends it to the
	      cache for storage.</t>

      <t>In the Distributed Cache mode, a client first queries other clients in the same
	      network using the Web Services Discovery multicast protocol. As in the 
	      Hosted Cache mode, the client retrieves the file from the content server if
	      it is not available locally.  After retrieving the file (either from another
	      client or the content server), the client stores the file locally.</t>

      <t>The original content server always authorizes requests from clients. Cached content
	      is encrypted, and clients can only decrypt the data using keys derived from 
	      metadata returned by the content server.  In addition to instrumenting the
	      networking stack at clients, content servers must also support BranchCache.</t>


      <section title="Applicability to DECADE">
	      <t>BranchCache is an example of an in-network storage system primarily targeted at
		      enterprise networks.  It supports both a P2P like mode (Distributed Cache)
		      as well as a client-server mode (Hosted Cache).  Integration into the Microsoft
	              OS will ensure wide distribution of this in-network storage technology.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Data Access Interface">
        <t>Clients transparently retrieve (read) data from a cache (other
        clients or a Hosted Cache) since it operates by instrumenting the
        networking stack. In Hosted Cache mode, clients write data to the Hosted
        Cache once it is retrieved from the content server.

      <section title="Resource Control Interface">
        <t>The storage capacity of caches on the clients and Hosted Caches are

	       	accesses. In the Distributed Caching mode, exponential back-off and
	       	throttling mechanisms are utilized to prevent reply storms of popular
	       	content requests. The client will also spread data block access among
	       	multiple serving clients that have the content (complete or partial) 
		to improve latency and provide some load balancing.</t>
      </section>
        
      <section title="Discovery Mechanism">
        <t>The Distributed Cache mode uses multicast for discovery of other
        clients and content within a local network. Currently, the Hosted Cache
        mode uses policy provisioning or manual configuration of the
        server used as the Hosted Cache.  In this mode, the address of the server
        may be found via DNS.</t>

    <section title="Cache-and-Forward Architecture">
    
      <t>Cache-and-Forward (CNF) <xref target="PRDW08"/> is an architecture
for content delivery services for the future Internet.  In this architecture,
storage can be exploited at nodes within the network, either directly at routers
or deployed nearby the routers. CNF is based on the concept of store-and-forward
routers with large storage, providing for opportunistic delivery to occasionally
disconnected mobile users and for in-network caching of content. The proposed
CNF protocol uses reliable hop-by-hop transfer of large data files between CNF
routers in place of an end-to-end transport protocol like TCP.</t>

    <section title="Cloud Data Management Interface">
    

      <t>The Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI) is a specification to access 
	      and manage cloud storage.  CDMI is specified by the Storage  Networking 
	      Industry Association (SNIA).</t>
      
      <t>CDMI is a functional interface that applications can use to create, retrieve,
	      update and delete data elements from the cloud.  As part of this interface
	      the client will be able to discover the capabilities of the cloud storage
	      offering and use this interface to manage containers and the data that is
	      placed in them.  In addition, metadata can be set on containers and their
	      contained data elements through this interface <xref target="CDMI"/>.</t>

      <t>CDMI follows a traditional client server model, and operates over an HTTP interface
	      using the Representational State Transfer (REST) model.  Similar to Amazon S3
	      buckets (see <xref target="AmazonS3Overview"/>), users may create containers into
	      which data objects may be stored.  Even though data objects may be accessed
	      via a user-defined name within a container, it is also possible to access data
	      objects by a storage-defined Object ID which is provided in the response upon
	      creation of a Data Object.</t>

    <section title="Content Delivery Network">
    
      <t>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) provides services that improve network performance by
maximizing bandwidth, improving accessibility and maintaining correctness
through content replication. They offer fast and reliable applications and
services by distributing content to cache or edge servers located close to
users. See  <xref target="PR07"/> for an additional taxonomy and survey.</t>

      <t>A CDN has some combination of content-delivery, request-routing,
distribution and accounting infrastructure. The content-delivery infrastructure
consists of a set of edge servers (also called surrogates) that deliver copies
of content to end-users. The request-routing infrastructure is responsible for
directing client requests to appropriate edge servers. It also interacts with the
distribution infrastructure to keep an up-to-date view of the content stored in
the CDN caches. The distribution infrastructure moves content from the origin
server to the CDN edge servers and ensures consistency of content in the caches.
The accounting infrastructure maintains logs of client accesses and records the
usage of the CDN servers. This information is used for traffic 
reporting and usage-based billing.</t>

      <t>In practice, a CDN typically hosts static content including images, video,
media clips, advertisements, and other embedded objects for Web viewing. A
focus for CDNs is the ability to publish and deliver content to end-users in
a reliable and timely manner. A CDN focuses on building its network
infrastructure to provide the following services and functionalities: storage
and management of content; distribution of content among surrogates; cache
management; delivery of static, dynamic and streaming content; backup and
disaster recovery solutions; and monitoring, performance measurement and
reporting.</t>

      <t>Examples of existing CDNs are Akamai, Limelight, and CloudFront.</t>

    <section title="Delay-Tolerant Network">

	    <t>The Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) <xref target="RFC4838"/> 
is an evolution of an architecture originally designed for the Interplanetary
Internet.  The Interplanetary Internet is a communication system envisioned
to provide Internet-like services across interplanetary distances in support
of deep space exploration. The DTN architecture can be utilized in
various operational environments characterized by severe communication 
disruptions, disconnections and high-delays (e.g., a month long loss of
connectivity between two planetary networks because of high solar
radiation due to sun spots).  The DTN architecture is thus suitable for
environments including deep space networks, sensor-based networks, certain
satellite networks and underwater acoustic networks.</t>

      <t>A key aspect of the DTN is a store and forward overlay layer called the
"Bundle Protocol" or "Bundle Layer" that exists between the transport and application
layers <xref target="RFC5050"/>.  The Bundle Layer forms a logical overlay that employs
persistent storage to help combat long term network interruptions by providing 
a store and forwarding service.  While traditional IP networks are also based on store
and forward principles, the amount of time of a packet being kept in "storage" at a
traditional IP router is typically in the order of milli-seconds (or less).  In 
contrast, the DTN architecture assumes that most Bundle Layer nodes will use some form of
persistent storage (e.g., hard disk, flash memory, etc.) for DTN packets because
of the nature of the DTN environment.</t>

    <section title="Named Data Networking" anchor="NDNsection">

	    <t>Named Data Networking (NDN) <xref target="NDN"/> is a research initiative which proposes to move
		    to a new model of addressing and routing for the Internet.  NDN uses "named data" based 
		    routing and forwarding, to replace the current IP address based model.  NDN also uses name-based
		    data caching in the routers.</t>
		   
		   
	    <t>Each NDN Data packet will be assigned a content name and will be cryptographically signed.
		    Data delivery is driven by the requesting end.  Routers disseminate name-based prefix 
		    announcements by using routing protocols like Intermediate System to Intermediate System
		    (IS-IS) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The requester will send out an "Interest" packet
		    which identifies the name of the data that it wants.  Routers that receive this Interest
		    packet will remember the interface it came from and will then forward it on a named-based
		    routing protocol.  Once an Interest packet reaches a node that has the desired data, a named
		    Data packet is sent back, which carries both the name and content of the data, along with
		    a digital signature of the producer.  This named Data packet is then forwarded back to the
		    original requester on the reverse path of the Interest packet <xref target="NDN_Proposal"/>.</t>


            <t>A key aspect of NDN is that router have the capability to cache the named data.
		    If a request for the same data (i.e., same name) comes to the router, then
		    the NDN router will forward the named data stored locally to fulfill the request.
		    The proponents of NDN believe that
		    the network can be designed naturally matching data delivery characteristics instead of
		    communication between endpoints because data delivery has become the primary use of the network.</t>

    <section title="Network of Information">

	    <t>Similar to NDN (see <xref target="NDNsection"/>), Network of Information (NetInf) 
		    <xref target="NetInf"/> is another information centric approach in
		    which the named data objects are the basic component of the networking architecture. 
		    NetInf is thus moving away from today's host centric networking architecture where the
		    nodes in the network are the primary objects. In today's network the information objects
		    are named relative to the hosts they are stored on
		    (e.g., http://www.example.com/information-object.txt).</t>

	    <t>The NetInf naming and security framework builds the foundation for an information centric security
		    model that integrates security deeply into the architecture. In this model, trust is based on
		    the information itself. Information Objects (IOs) are given a unique name with cryptographic properties.
		    Together with additional metadata, the name can be used to verify the data integrity as well as
		    several other security properties, like self-certification, name persistency, and owner
		    authentication and identification. The approach also gives some benefits over the security model
		    in today's host centric networks, as it minimizes the need for trust in the infrastructure,
		    including the hosts providing the data, the channel, or the resolution service.</t>  

	    <t>In NetInf the information objects are published into the network. They are registered with a
		    Name Resolution Service (NRS). The NRS is also used to register network locators that can be
		    used to retrieve data objects that represent the published IOs. When a
		    receiver wants to retrieve an IO, the request for the IO is resolved by the NRS into a set of
		    locators. These locators are then used to retrieve a copy of the data object from the "best"
		    available source(s). NetInf is open to use any type of underlying transport networks. The locators
		    can thus be a heterogeneous set, e.g., IPv4, IPv6, MAC, etc.</t>

	    <t>NetInf will make extensive use of caching of information objects in the network and will provide network
		    functionality that is similar to what overlay solutions like Content Distribution Networks
		    (CDN) and p2p distribution networks (e.g., BitTorrent) provide today.</t>

(storing) systems.  For example, the Kodak Gallery system 
<xref target="KodakGallery01"/> serves over 60 million users and stores
billions of images <xref target="KodakGallery02"/>. Other well known examples
of Photo Sharing systems include Flickr <xref target="Flickr"/> and 
ImageShack <xref target="ImageShack"/>.  Also there are a number of popular
blogging services, such as Tumblr <xref target="Tumblr"/>, which specialize
in also sharing large numbers of photos and other multimedia content 
(e.g., video, text, audio, etc.) as part of their service.  All these
in-network storage systems utilize both free and paid subscription models.</t>

      <t>Most Photo Sharing systems are traditional client-server architecture. 
However, a minority of systems also offer a P2P mode of operation. The client-server
architecture is typically based on HTTP with a browser client and a web server.</t>

    <section title="P2P Cache">
    
      <t>Caching of P2P traffic is a useful approach to reduce P2P network
traffic, because objects in P2P systems are mostly immutable and the traffic is
highly repetitive. In addition, making use of P2P caches do not require changes
to P2P protocols and can be deployed transparently from clients. </t>

      <t>P2P caches operate similarly to web caches, in that they temporarily
store frequently-requested content. Requests for content already stored in the
cache can be served from local storage instead of requiring the data to be
transmitted over expensive network links.</t>

      <t>Two types of P2P caches exist: non-transparent P2P caches  and
transparent P2P caches. A non-transparent cache appears as a super peer; it
explicitly peers with other P2P clients. For a transparent cache, once a P2P
cache is established, the network will transparently redirect P2P traffic to the
cache, which either serves the file directly or passes the request on to a
remote P2P user and simultaneously caches that data. Transparency is typically
implemented using deep packet inspection (DPI). DPI products identify and pass
P2P packets to the P2P caching system so it can cache the traffic and accelerate
it. </t>

      <t>To enable operation with existing P2P software, P2P caches directly
support P2P application protocols.  A large number of P2P protocols are used by
P2P software, and hence are supported by caches, leading to higher complexity. 
Additionally, these protocols evolve over time, and new protocols are
introduced.</t>

    <section title="Usenet">
	    <t>Usenet is a distributed Internet based discussion (message) system.
The Usenet messages are arranged as a set of "newsgroups" that are classified hierarchically by subject.
Usenet information is distributed and stored among a large conglomeration of servers that store
and forward messages to one another in so called news feeds.  Individual users may read
messages from and post messages to a local news server typically operated by an ISP.  This local
server communicates with other servers and exchanges articles with them.  In this fashion,
the message is copied from server to server and eventually reaches every server in the network 
<xref target="Usenet"/>.</t>

	     <t>Traditional Usenet as described above operates as a P2P network between the
servers, and in a client-server architecture between the user and their local news server.
The user requires a Usenet client to be installed on their computer and a Usenet server account
(through their ISP).  However, with the rise of web browsers the Usenet architecture is evolving
to be web based. The most popular example of this is Google Groups where Google hosts all the
newsgroups and client access is via a standard HTTP based web browser <xref target="GoogleGroups"/>.</t>

    <section title="Web Cache">
      
      <t>Web cache <xref target="GH09"/> has been widely deployed by many ISPs to
	      reduce bandwidth consumption and web access latency since the late 1990s.  A web
	      cache can cache the web documents (e.g., HTML pages, images) between server and
	      client to reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag. A web cache
	      server is typically shared by many clients, and stores copies of documents
	      passing through it; subsequent requests may be satisfied from the cache
	      if certain conditions are met.</t>

      <t>Another form of cache is a client-side cache, typically implemented in web
	      browsers.  A client side cache can keep a local copy of all pages recently 
	      displayed by browser, and when the user returns to one of these web pages, 
	      the local cached copy is reused. </t>

      <t>A related protocol for P2P applications to use web cache is HPTP
	      (HTTP based Peer to Peer) <xref target="GYZ07"/>. It proposes
	      to share chunks of P2P files/streams using HTTP protocol with
	      cache-control headers.</t>

          <section title="Observations Regarding In-Network Storage Systems">

	    <t>This following observations about the surveyed In-Network storage systems
	            are made in the context of DECADE as defined by 
		    <xref target="I-D.ietf-decade-problem-statement"/>.</t>
	    
	    <t>The majority of the surveyed systems were designed for
		    client-server architectures and do not support P2P.  However, there
		    are some important exceptions, especially for some of the newer
		    technologies such as BranchCache and P2P Cache which do support a
		    P2P mode.</t>

	    <t>The P2P cache systems are interesting since they do not require changes
		    to P2P applications themselves.  However, this is also a limitation
		    in that they are required to support each application protocol.</t>

	    <t>Many of the surveyed systems were designed for caching as
		    opposed to long term network storage.  Thus during DECADE protocol
		    design it should be carefully considered if a caching mode should
		    be supported in addition to a long term network storage mode.  There is typically
	            a trade-off between providing a caching mode and long-term (and usually
		    also reliable) storage with regards to some performance metrics.  
		    Note that <xref target="I-D.ietf-decade-problem-statement"/> identifies
		    issues with classical caching from a DECADE perspective such as the 
		    fact that P2P caches typically do not allow users to explicitly control 
		    content stored in the cache.</t>

            <t>Certain components of the surveyed systems are outside of the scope of
                    DECADE. For example, a protocol used for searching across multiple
                    DECADE servers is out of scope.  However, applications may still
                    be able to implement such functionality if DECADE exposes the
                    appropriate primitives. This has the benefit of keeping the core
                    in-network storage systems simple, while permitting diverse applications
                    to design mechanisms that meet their own requirements.</t>

	    <t>Today, most in-network storage systems follow some variant of the
		    authorization model of public-unrestricted, public-restricted,
		    and private.  For DECADE, we may need to evolve the
	            authorization model to support a resource owner (e.g., end user)
		    authorization, in addition to the network authorization.</t>

    <section title="HTTP" anchor="HTTP">
    
	    <t>HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> is a key protocol for the World Wide
		    Web.  It is a stateless client-server protocol that allows applications to
		    be designed using the REST model. HTTP is often associated with downloading (reading) content from web
		    servers to web browsers, but it also has support for uploading (writing) 
		    of content to web servers.  It has been used as the underlying
	            protocol for other protocols such as WebDAV.</t>

	    <t>HTTP is used in some of the most popular in-network storage systems surveyed previously 
		    including CDNs, Photo Sharing, and Web Cache.  Usage of HTTP by a storage

        <t>Manual configuration is typically used. Clients address NFS
servers by providing a hostname and a directory that should be mounted. DNS may be used lookup
an address for the provided hostname.</t>
      </section>
        
      <section title="Storage Mode">
        <t>As a protocol, there is no defined internal storage mode. However,
          implementations typically use the underlying filesystem storage. Note that
          extensions have been defined for alternate storage modes (e.g.,
          block-based <xref target="RFC5663"/> and
          object-based <xref target="RFC5664"/>).</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Comments" anchor="NFSComments">

        <t>The efficiency and scalability of the NFS access control
        method is a concern in the context of DECADE. In particular, Section 6.2.1 of
        <xref target="RFC5661"/> states that:
        <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    Only ACEs that have a "who" that matches the requester
    are considered.
        ]]></artwork></figure>
        Thus, in the context of DECADE, to specify per-peer access control
        policies for an object, a client would need to explicitly configure the
        ACL for the object for each individual peer. A concern with this approach
        is scalability when a client's peers may change frequently and ACLs for
        many small objects need to be updated constantly during participation
        in a swarm.</t>

        <t>Note that NFS v4.1's usage of RPCSEC_GSS provides support for multiple
        security mechanisms.  Kerberos V5 is required, but others such as X.509
        certificates are also supported by way of GSS-API.  Note, however, that
        NFSv4.1's usage of such security mechanisms is limited to linking a
        requesting user to a particular account maintained by the NFS server.</t>

    <section title="OAuth">
    
        <t>OAuth <xref target="RFC5849"/> is a protocol
	that enriches the traditional client-server authentication model
	for web resources.  In particular, OAuth distinguishes the "client"
	from the "resource owner", thus enabling a resource owner to authorize
	a particular client for access (e.g., for a particular lifetime) to
	private resources.</t>
	
        <t>We include OAuth in this survey so that its authentication model
		can be evaluated in the context of DECADE.  OAuth itself, however,
	       	is not a network storage protocol.</t>

	(4) a callback is made to the client indicating that its request

    <section title="WebDAV">
    
        <t>WebDAV <xref target="RFC4918"/> is a protocol designed for Web
		content authoring.  It is developed as an extension to HTTP described in 
		<xref target="HTTP"/>, meaning it can be simpler to integrate into existing
	       	software.  WebDAV supports traditional operations for reading/writing from
	       	storage, as well as other constructs such as locking and collections which are
	       	important when multiple users collaborate to author or edit a set of documents.</t>
    
      <section title="Data Access Interface">
        <t>Traditional read and write operations are supported (using HTTP
        GET and PUT methods, respectively). Locking is provided to ease
        concurrent access by multiple clients.</t>
      </section>
        
      <section title="Data Management Operations">
        <t>WebDAV supports traditional file-system operations such as
        move, delete and copy.  Objects are organized into collections, and
        these operations can also be performed on collections. WebDAV
        also allows objects to have user-defined properties.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Data Search Capability">
        <t>User has the ability to list contents of collections to find
        objects matching desired criteria. A SEARCH extension
        <xref target="RFC5323"/> has also
        been specified allowing listing of objects matching client-defined
        criteria.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Access Control Authorization">
	      <t>All methods of access control for clients are supported: public-unrestricted, 
		      public-restricted and private.</t>

	      <t>For example, an ACL extension <xref target="RFC3744"/> is provided for WebDAV. ACLs
		      allow both user- and group-based access control policies (relating to
		      reading, writing, properties, locking, etc) to be defined for 
		      objects and collections.</t>
        
        <t>A ticketing extension <xref target="I-D.ito-dav-ticket"/> has also
        been proposed, but has not progressed beyond an Internet Draft.
        This extension allows a client to request the WebDAV server to create
        a "ticket" (e.g., for reading an object) that can be distributed to
        other clients.  Tickets may be given expiration times, or may only allow
        for a fixed number of uses.  The proposed extension requires the server
        to generate tickets and maintain state for outstanding tickets.</t>
      </section>
        
      <section title="Resource Control Interface">
        <t>An extension <xref target="RFC4331"/> allows disk space quotas to
        be configured for Collections.  The extension also allows WebDAV clients
        to query current disk space usage. User control of
        bandwidth and connections used by remote peers is not provided.</t>
      </section>
        
      <section title="Discovery Mechanism">
        <t>Manual configuration is typically used. Clients address WebDAV
        servers by providing a hostname, which can be resolved to an address using DNS.</t>
      </section>
        
      <section title="Storage Mode">
        <t>Though no storage mode is explicitly defined, WebDAV can be thought of as providing
          file-based storage to a client.  A non-collection resource can typically
        be thought of as a "file".  Files may be organized into collections,
        which typically map on to the HTTP Path hierarchy.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Comments" anchor="WebDAVComments">

        <t>The efficiency and scalability of the WebDAV access control
        method is a concern in the context of DECADE, for similar reasons
        as stated in <xref target="NFSComments"/> for NFS. The proposed WebDAV
        ticketing extension partially alleviates this concern, but the
        particular technique may need further evaluation before being applied
        to DECADE.  In particular, since DECADE clients may continuously
        upload/download a large number of small-size objects, and a single DECADE server may
        need to scale to many concurrent DECADE clients, requiring the server
        to maintain ticket state and generate tickets may not be the best
        design choice. Server-generated
        tickets can also increase latency for data transport operations
        depending on the message flow used by DECADE.</t>

    <section title="Observations Regarding Storage and Related Protocols">


	    <t>This following observations about the surveyed storage and related protocols
	            are made in the context of DECADE as defined by 
		    <xref target="I-D.ietf-decade-problem-statement"/>.</t>

	    <t>All of the surveyed protocols were primarily designed for client-server architectures
		    and not for P2P.  However, it is conceivable that some of the protocols could be
	            adapted to work in a P2P architecture.</t>

	    <t>Several popular in-network storage systems today use HTTP as their key
		    protocol even though it is not classically considered as a storage protocol.
		    HTTP is a stateless protocol that is used to design RESTful
		    applications.  HTTP is a well supported and widely implemented protocol which
		    can provide important insights for DECADE.</t>

	    <t>The majority of the surveyed protocols do not support low latency access for
		    applications such as live streaming.  This was one of the key general 
		    requirements for DECADE.</t>

	    <t>The majority of the surveyed protocols do not support any form of resource 
		    control interface.  Resource control is required for users
		    to manage the resources on in-network storage that can be used by
		    other peers, e.g., the bandwidth or connections.  Resource control
		    is a key capability required for DECADE.</t>

	    <t>Nearly all surveyed protocols did however support the following capabilities
		    which are required for DECADE: user ability to read/write content;
		    some form of access control; some form of error indication;
		    and ability to traverse firewalls and NATs.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Conclusions">

      <t>Though there have been many successful in-network storage systems,
      they have been designed for use cases different from those defined
      in DECADE.  For example, many of the surveyed in-network storage systems and protocols were
      designed for client-server architectures and not P2P.  No surveyed system or protocol
      has the functionality and features to fully meet the set of requirements defined for DECADE.  
      DECADE aims to provide a standard protocol for P2P applications and content provider
      to access and control in-network storage, resulting in increased network efficiency
      while retaining control over content shared with peers.  Additionally, defining a standard
      protocol can reduce complexity of in-network storage since multiple P2P 
      application protocols no longer need to be implemented by in-network storage systems.</t>

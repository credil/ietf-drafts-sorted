                <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> profiles certificates, certificate revocation lists,
                and certificate signing requests specified in <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> for use
                in routing public key infrastructure.
            </t>
            <t>
                <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> defines an extension to certificates for the listing
                of policy information (See section 4.2.1.4). <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> states in
                Section 4.8.9: "This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked critical.  It MUST
                include exactly one policy, as specified in the RPKI CP <xref target="RFC6484"></xref>".
                This references the CertPolicyId of the sequence allowed in PolicyInformation as
                defined by <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> also specifies that PolicyInformation may optionally
                have a sequence of PolicyQualifierInfo objects. <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> does
                not specifically allow or disallow these PolicyQualifierInfo objects although it also 
                states in section 4: "Unless specifically noted as being OPTIONAL, all the fields 
                listed here MUST be present, and any other fields MUST NOT appear in a conforming resource 
                certificate."

                The Security Considerations of <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> apply to this document.

            <t>
                This document updates the RPKI certificate profile to specify that the
                certificate policies extension can include a policy qualifier, which is
                a URI.  Checking of the URI might allow denial-of-service (DoS) attacks,
                where the target host may be subjected to bogus work resolving the URI.
                However, this specification, like <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>, places no processing
                requirements on the URI included in the qualifier.
            </t>
            <t>
                As an update to <xref target="RFC6487"></xref>, this document broadens the class of certificates that 
                conform to the RPKI profile by explicitly including within the profile those certificates 
                that contain a policy qualifier as described here. A relying party that performs a strict 
                validation based on <xref target="RFC6487"></xref> and fails to support the updates described in this document, 
                would incorrectly invalidate RPKI objects that include the changes in <xref target="update_6487"></xref>.
            </t>

        <section title="Acknowledgements">
            <t>
                Frank Hill and Adam Guyot helped define the scope of this issue and identified and
                worked with RPKI validator implementers to clarify the use of policy qualifiers
                in resource certificates.

            <t>
                Sean Turner provided significant text to this document regarding the processing of
                the CPS URI and limiting the scope of the allowable content of the policy qualifier.

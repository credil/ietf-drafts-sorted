<abstract>
<t>This document specifies the process that Certification Authorities (CAs) and Relying Parties (RP) participating in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new
  (and probably cryptographically stronger) algorithm set. The process is expected to be 
  completed in a time scale of months or years. Consequently, no emergency transition is specified. The
transition procedure defined in this document supports only a top-down migration (parent migrates before children).

<section title="Introduction">
<t>The RPKI must accommodate transitions between the public keys used by CAs. Transitions of this sort are usually termed “key rollover”.  Planned key rollover will occur at regular intervals throughout the life of the RPKI, as each CA changes its public keys, in a non-coordinated fashion. (By non-coordinated we mean that the time at which each CA elects to change its keys is locally determined, not coordinated across the RPKI.) Moreover, because a key change might be necessitated by suspected private key compromise, one can never assume coordination of these events among all of the CAs in the RPKI. In an emergency key rollover, the old certificate is revoked and a new certificate with a new key is issued. The mechanisms to perform a key rollover in RPKI (either planned or in an emergency), while maintaining the same algorithm suite, are covered in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-keyroll"/>.</t>
<t>This document describes the mechanism to perform a key rollover in RPKI due to the migration to a new signature algorithm suite. A signature algorithm suite encompasses both a signature algorithm (with a specified key size range) and a one-way hash algorithm.  It is anticipated that the RPKI will require the adoption of updated key sizes and/or different algorithm suites over time.  This document treats the adoption of a new hash algorithm while retaining the current signature algorithm as equivalent to an algorithm migration, and requires the CA to change its key. Migration to a new algorithm suite will be required in order to maintain an acceptable level of cryptographic security and protect the integrity of certificates, CRLs and signed objects in the RPKI. All of the data structures in the RPKI explicitly identify the signature and hash algorithms being used. However, experience has demonstrated that the ability to represent algorithm IDs is not sufficient to enable migration to new algorithm suites (algorithm agility). One also must ensure that protocols, infrastructure elements, and operational procedures also accommodate migration from one algorithm suite to another.  Algorithm migration is expected to be very infrequent, but it also will require support of a “current” and “next” suite for a prolonged interval, probably several years.</t>
<t>This document defines how entities in the RPKI execute (planned) CA key rollover when the algorithm suite changes. The description covers actions by CAs, repository operators, and RPs. It describes the behavior required of both CAs and RPs to make such key changes work in the RPKI context, including how the RPKI repository system is used to support key rollover.</t>
<t>This document does not specify any algorithm suite.</t>
<t>A failure to comply with this process during an algorithm transition MUST be considered as non-compliance with the RPKI Certificate Policy (CP) <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-cp"/>.</t>

<section title="Process overview">
<t>The migration process described in this document involves a series of steps that MUST be executed in chronological order by CAs and RPs. The only milestone that affects both CAs and RPs, at the same moment is the EOL date. Due to the decentralized nature of the RPKI infrastructure, it is expected that the process will take several months or even years. </t>
<t>In order to facilitate the transition, CAs will start issuing certificates using the Algorithm B in a hierarchical top-down order. In our example, CA Y will issue certificates using the Algorithm B suite only after CA X has started to do so (CA Y Ready Algorithm B Date > CA X Ready Algorithm B Date). This ordered transition avoids issuance of "mixed" suite certificates, e.g., a certificate signed using Suite A, containing a key from Suite B. In RPKI an algorithm suite MUST NOT sign a certificate carrying a subject key that corresponds to another algorithm suite.</t>

<section anchor="sync" title="Multi Algorithm support in the RPKI provisioning protocol">
<t>The migration described in this document is a top-down process, where two synchronization issues need to be solved between child and parent CAs: 
<list style="symbols">
	<t>A child CA needs to identify which algorithm suites are supported by its parent CA</t>
	<t>A child CA needs to identify which algorithm suite should be used to sign a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The RPKI provisioning protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-rescerts-provisioning" /> supports multiple algorithms suites by implementing a different resource classes for each suite. Several different resource classes also may use the same algorithm suite for different resource sets.</t>

<t>A child CA that wants to identify which algorithm suites are supported by its parent CA MUST perform the following tasks:
<list style="numbers">
	<t>Establish a provisioning protocol session with its parent CA</t>
	<t>Perform a "list" command as described in Section 3.3.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-rescerts-provisioning" /></t>
	<t>From the Payload in the "list response" resource class, extract the "issuer's certificate" for each class. The Algorithm Suite for each class will match the Algorithm Suite used to issue the corresponding "issuer's certificate".</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>A child CA that wants to specify an Algorithm Suite to its parent CA (e.g., in a certificate request)  MUST perform the following tasks:
<list style="numbers">
	<t>Perform the tasks to identify the resource class for each Algorithm Suite supported by its parent CA (as above).</t>
	<t>Identify the corresponding resource class in the appropriate provisioning protocol command (e.g. "issue" or "revoke")</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Upon receipt of a certificate request from a child CA, a parent CA will verify the PoP of the private key. If a child CA requests issuing a certificate using an algorithm suite that does not match a resource class, the PoP validation will fail and the request will not be performed.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Validation of multiple instance of signed products">
<t>During Phases 1,2,3 and 4, two algorithm suites will be valid simultaneously in RPKI. In this section, we describe the RP behavior when validating instances of the same signed product but signed with different algorithm suites. As a general rule, the validation of signed products using different algorithm suites are independent and the RP MUST NOT keep any relationship between the different hierarchies.</t>
<t>During Phase 1 two (corresponding) files for an object MAY be available for each signed product, one signed under Algorithm Suite A and one under Algorithm Suite B.  When an RP validates these signed products, if either instance of an object validates, the product is accepted. A failure to validate one instance of a product, under either algorithm Suite MUST NOT cause the RP to reject the other instance of the product. Because both instances of such products MUST contain the same resources, relying on either instance will yield the same outcome.</t>
<t>During Phases 2 and 3 of this process, two (corresponding) instances of all signed products MUST be available to RPs. As in Phase 1, when an RP validates these signed products, if either instance validates, the product is accepted. A failure to validate one instance of a product, under either algorithm Suite MUST NOT cause the RP to reject the other instance of the product. Also, as above, if only one instance of a signed product can be validated, subordinate products issued under the other (non-validated) algorithm suite cannot be used, and thus SHOULD NOT be processed (or even retrieved).</t>
<t>During Phase 4 two (corresponding) files for an object MAY be available for each signed product, one signed under Algorithm Suite A and one under Algorithm Suite C.  When an RP validates these signed products, if either instance of an object validates, the product is accepted. A failure to validate one instance of a product, under either algorithm Suite MUST NOT cause the RP to reject the other instance of the product. Because both instances of such products MUST contain the same resources, relying on either instance will yield the same outcome.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Revocations">
<t>As the algorithm migration process mandates the maintenance of two parallel certificate hierarchies, revocations requests for each algorithm suite MUST be handled independently. A Child CA MUST request revocation of a certificate relative to a specific algorithm suite.</t>
<t>During phase 2 and phase 3, the two parallel certificate hierarchies are designed to carry identical information. Consequently, a child CA requesting the revocation of a certificate during these two phases MUST perform that request for both algorithm suites (A and B). A non-leaf CA is NOT required to verify that its child CAs comply with this requirement.</t>
</section>

<section title="Key rollover">
<t>Key rollover (without algorithm changes) is effected independently for each algorithm suite and MUST follow the process described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-keyroll"/>.</t>

<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
<t>No IANA requirements</t>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>An algorithm transition in RPKI should be a very infrequent event and it requires wide community consensus. The events that may lead to an algorithm transition may be related to a weakness of the cryptographic strength of the algorithm suite in use by RPKI, which is normal to happen over time. The procedure described in this document will take months or years to complete an algorithm transition. During that time, the RPKI system will be vulnerable to any cryptographic weakness that may have triggered this procedure.</t>
<t>This document does not describe an emergency mechanism for algorithm migration. Due to the distributed nature of RPKI, and the very large number of CAs and RPs, the authors do not believe it is feasible to effect an emergency algorithm migration procedure.</t>
<t>If a CA does not complete its migration to the new algorithm suite as described in this document (after the EOL of the "old" algorithm suite), its signed product set will not longer be valid. Consequently, the RPKI may, at the end of Phase 4, have a smaller number of valid signed products than before starting the process. Conversely, a RP that does not follow this process will lose the ability to validate signed products issued under the new algorithm suite. The resulting incomplete view of routing info from the RPKI (as a result of a failure by CAs or RPs to complete the transition) could degrade routing in the public Internet.</t>

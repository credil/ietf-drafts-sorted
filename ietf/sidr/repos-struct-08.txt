        A Profile for Resource Certificate Repository Structure
                  draft-ietf-sidr-repos-struct-08.txt

Abstract

   This document defines a profile for the structure of the Resource PKI
   distributed repository.  Each individual repository publication point
   is a directory that contains files that correspond to X.509 / PKIX
   Resource Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists and signed
   objects.  This profile defines the recommended object (file) naming
   scheme, the recommended contents of repository publication points
   (directories), and a suggested internal structure of a local
   repository cache that is intended to facilitate synchronization
   across a distributed collection of repository publication points and
   facilitate certification path construction.

1.  Introduction

   To validate attestations made in the context of the Resource Public
   Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch], relying parties (RPs)
   need access to all the X.509 / PKIX Resource Certificates,
   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and signed objects that
   collectively define the RPKI.

   Each issuer of a certificate, CRL or a signed object makes it
   available for download to RPs through the publication of the object
   in an RPKI repository.

   The repository system is a collection of all signed objects that MUST
   be globally accessible to all RPs.  When certificates, CRLs and
   signed objects are created, they are uploaded to a repository
   publication point, from whence they can be downloaded for use by RPs.

   This profile defines the recommended object (file) naming scheme, the
   recommended contents of repository publication points (directories),
   and a suggested internal structure of a local repository cache that
   is intended to facilitate synchronization across a distributed
   collection of repository publication points and facilitate
   certification path construction.

   A Resource Certificate attests to a binding of an entity's public key
   to a set of IP address blocks and AS numbers.  The Subject of a
   Resource Certificate can demonstrate that it is the holder of the
   resources enumerated in the certificate by using its private key to
   generate a digital signature (that can be verified using the public
   key from the certificate).

1.1.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280], and "X.509
   Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779].

   In addition, the following terms are used in this document:

   Repository Object (or Object):
      This refers to a terminal object in a repository publication
      point.  A terminal object is conventionally implemented as a file
      in a publicly accessible directory, where the file is not a
      directory itself, although other forms of objects that have an
      analogous public appearance to a file are encompassed by this
      term.

Internet-Draft        ResCert Repository Structure             June 2011


   Repository Publication Point:
      This refers to a collection of Repository Objects that are
      published at a common publication point.  This is conventionally
      implemented as a directory in a publicly accessible filesystem
      that is identified by a URI [RFC3986], although other forms of
      local storage that have an analogous public appearance to a simple
      directory of files are also encompassed by this term.

   Repository Instance:
      This refers to a collection of one or more Repository Publication
      Points that share a common publication instance.  This
      conventionally is implemented as a collection of filesystem
      directories that share a common URI prefix, where each directory
      is also identifiable by its own unique URI.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  RPKI Repository Publication Point Content and Structure

   The RPKI does not require that a single repository instance contain
   all published RPKI objects.  Instead, the RPKI repository system is
   comprised of multiple repository instances.  Each individual
   repository instance is composed of one or more repository publication
   points.  Each repository publication point is used by one or more
   entities referenced in RPKI certificates, as defined in the
   certificate's Subject Information Authority (SIA) extension.

   This section describes the collection of objects (RPKI certificates,
   CRLs, manifests and signed objects) held in repository publication
   points.

   For every Certification Authority (CA) certificate in the RPKI there
   is a corresponding repository publication point that is the
   authoritative publication point for all current certificates and CRLs
   issued by this CA.  The certificate's SIA extension contains a URI
   [RFC3986] that references this repository publication point and
   identifies the repository access mechanisms.  Additionally, a
   certificate's Authority Information Access (AIA) extension contains a
   URI that references the authoritative location for the Certification
   Authority (CA) certificate under which the given certificate was
   issued.

   For example, if the subject of certificate A has issued certificates
   B and C, then the AIA extensions of certificates B and C both point
   to the publication point for the certificate A object, and the SIA

   extension of certificate A points to a repository publication point
   (directory) containing certificates B and C (see Figure 1).

   Figure 1.  Use of AIA and SIA extensions in the RPKI.

   In Figure 1, certificates B and C are issued by (CA) A. Therefore,
   the AIA extensions of certificates B and C point to (certificate) A,
   and the SIA extension of certificate A points to the repository
   publication point of CA A's subordinate products, which includes
   certificates B and C, as well as the CRL issued by A. The CRL
   Distribution Points (CRLDP) extension in certificates B and C both
   point to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) issued by A.

   In this distributed repository structure an instance of a CA's
   repository publication point contains all published certificates
   issued by that CA, and the CRL issued by that CA.  This repository
   also contains all published digitally signed objects that are
   verified by an EE certificate issued by this CA.

2.1.  Manifests

   Every repository publication point MUST contain a manifest
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-manifests].  The manifest contains a list of the
   names of all objects, as well as the hash value of each object's
   contents, that are currently published by a CA, or by an EE.

   An authority MAY perform a number of object operations on a
   publication repository within the scope of a repository change before
   issuing a single manifest that covers all the operations within the
   scope of this change.  Repository operators SHOULD implement some
   form of directory management regime function on the repository to
   ensure that RPs who are performing retrieval operations on the
   repository are not exposed to intermediate states during changes to
   the repository and the associated manifest.

2.2.  CA Repository Publication Points

   A CA Certificate has two accessMethod elements specified in its SIA
   field.  The id-ad-caRepository accessMethod element has an associated
   accessLocation element that points to the repository publication
   point of the certificates issued by this CA, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].  The id-ad-rpkiManifest accessMethod
   element has an associated accessLocation element that points to the
   manifest object, as an object URI (as distinct to a directory URI),
   that is associated with this CA.

   A CA's publication repository contains the current (non-expired and
   non-revoked) certificates issued by this CA, the most recent CRL
   issued by this CA, the current manifest, and all other current signed
   objects that can be verified using an EE certificate
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] issued by this CA.

   The CA's manifest contains the names of this collection of objects,
   together with the hash value of each object's contents, with the
   single exception of the manifest itself.

   The RPKI design requires that a CA be uniquely associated with a
   single key pair.  Thus, the administrative entity that is a CA
   performs key rollover by generating a new CA certificate with a new
   Subject name, as well as a new key pair [I-D.ietf-sidr-keyroll].
   (The reason for the new Subject name is that in the context of the
   RPKI the Subject names in all certificates issued by a CA are
   intended to be unique, and because the RPKI key rollover procedure
   creates a new instance of a CA with the new key, the name constraint
   implies the need for a new Subject name for the CA with the new key.)
   In such cases the entity SHOULD continue to use the same repository
   publication point for both CA instances during the key rollover,



Huston, et al.          Expires December 10, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        ResCert Repository Structure             June 2011


   ensuring that the value of the AIA extension in indirect subordinate
   objects that refer to the certificates issued by this CA remain valid
   across the key rollover, and that the re-issuance of subordinate
   certificates in a key rollover is limited to the collection of
   immediate subordinate products of this CA.  In such cases the
   repository publication point will contain the CRL, manifest and
   subordinate certificates of both CA instances.

   The following paragraphs provide guidelines for naming objects in a
   CA's repository publication point:

   CRL:
      When a CA issues a new CRL, it replaces the previous CRL (issued
      under the same CA key pair) in the repository publication point.
      CAs MUST NOT continue to publish previous CRLs in the repository
      publication point.  Thus, it SHOULD replace (overwrite) previous
      CRLs signed by the same CA (instance).  A non-normative guideline
      for naming such objects is that the file name chosen for the CRL
      in the repository be a value derived from the public key of the
      CA.  One such method of generating a CRL publication name is
      described in section 2.1 of [RFC4387]; convert the 160-bit hash of
      a CA's public key value into a 27-character string using a
      modified form of Base64 encoding, with an additional modification
      as proposed in section 5, table 2, of [RFC4648].  The filename
      extension of ".crl" MUST be used, to denote the file as a CRL.
      Each ".crl" file contains exactly one CRL, encoded in DER format.

   Manifest:
      When a new instance of a manifest is published, it SHOULD replace
      the previous manifest, to avoid confusion.  CAs MUST NOT continue
      to publish previous CA manifests in the repository publication
      point.  A non-normative guideline for naming such objects is that
      the filename chosen for the manifest in the publication repository
      be a value derived from the public key part of the entity's key
      pair, using the algorithm described for CRLs above for generation
      of filenames.  The filename extension of ".mft" MUST be used, to
      denote the object as a manifest.

   Certificates:
      Within the RPKI framework it is possible that a CA MAY issue a
      series of certificates to the same subject name, the same subject
      public key, and the same resource collection.  However, a relying
      party requires access only to the most recently published
      certificate in such a series.  Thus, the such a series of
      certificates SHOULD share the same filename.  This ensures that
      each successive issued certificate in such a series effectively
      overwrites the previous instance of the certificate.  A non-
      normative guideline for naming such objects is for the CA to adopt



Huston, et al.          Expires December 10, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        ResCert Repository Structure             June 2011


      a (local) policy requiring a subject to use a unique key pair for
      each unique instance of a certificate series issued to the same
      subject, thereby allowing the CA to use a file name generation
      scheme based on the subject's public key, e.g., using the
      algorithm described above for CRLs above.  Published certificates
      MUST use a filename extension of ".cer" to denote the object as a
      certificate.  Each ".cer" file contains exactly one certificate,
      encoded in DER format.

   Signed Objects:
      RPKI Signed objects [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object] are published in
      the repository publication point referenced by the SIA of the CA
      certificate that issued the EE certificate used to validate the
      digital signature of the signed object (and are directly
      referenced by the SIA of that EE certificate).  A general non-
      normative guideline for naming such RPKI Signed Objects is for the
      filename of such objects to be derived from the associated EE
      certificate's public key, applying the algorithm described above.
      Published RPKI Signed Objects MUST NOT use the filename extensions
      ".crl", ".mft", or ".cer".

      One form of signed object defined at the time of publication of
      this document is a Route Origination Authorization (ROA)
      [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format].  Published ROAs MUST use a filename
      extension of ".roa" to denote the object as a ROA.


3.  Resource Certificate Publication Repository Considerations

   Each issuer MAY publish its issued certificates and CRL in any
   repository.  However, there are a number of considerations that guide
   the choice of a suitable repository publication structure:

      *  The publication repository SHOULD be hosted on a highly
         available service and high capacity publication platform.

      *  The publication repository MUST be available using RSYNC
         [RFC5781].  Support of additional retrieval mechanisms is the
         choice of the repository operator.  The supported retrieval
         mechanisms MUST be consistent with the accessMethod element
         value(s) specified in the SIA of the associated CA or EE
         certificate.

      *  Each CA repository publication point SHOULD contain the
         products of this CA, including those objects that can be
         verified by EE certificates that have been issued by this CA.
         The signed products of related CA's that are operated by the
         same entity MAY share this CA repository publication point.



Huston, et al.          Expires December 10, 2011               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        ResCert Repository Structure             June 2011


         Aside from subdirectories, any other objects SHOULD NOT be
         placed in a repository publication point.

         Any such subdirectory SHOULD be the repository publication
         point of a CA or EE certificate that is contained in the CA
         directory.  These considerations also apply recursively to
         subdirectories of these directories.

      *  Signed Objects are published in the location indicated by the
         SIA field of the EE certificate used to verify the signature of
         each object.  Signed objects are published in the repository
         publication point of the CA certificate that issued the EE
         certificate.  The SIA extension of the EE certificate
         references this object rather than the repository publication
         directory[I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].

      *  It is recommended in Section 2.1 that repository operators
         SHOULD implement some form of directory management regime
         function on the repository to ensure that RPs who are
         performing retrieval operations on the repository are not
         exposed to intermediate states during changes to the repository
         and the associated manifest.  Notwithstanding the following
         commentary, RPs SHOULD NOT assume that a consistent repository
         and manifest state is assured, and organise their retrieval
         operations accordingly (see Section 5).

         The manner in which a repository operator can implement a
         directory update regime that mitigates the risk of the manifest
         and directory contents being inconsistent, to some extent, is
         dependent on the operational characteristics of the filesystem
         that hosts the repository, so the following comments are non-
         normative in terms of any implicit guidelines for repository
         operators.

         A commonly used technique to avoid exposure to inconsistent
         retrieval states during updates to a large directory, is to
         batch a set of changes to be made, create a working copy of the
         directory's contents, and then perform the batch of changes to
         this local copy of the directory.  On completion, rename the
         filesystem symbolic link of the repository directory name to
         point to this working copy of the directory.  The old
         repository directory contents can be purged at a slightly later
         time.  However, it is noted that the outcomes of this technique
         in terms of ensuring the integrity of client synchronization
         functions performed over the directory depend on the
         interaction between the supported access mechanisms and the
         local filesystem behaviour.  It is probable that this technique
         will not remove all possibilities for RPs to see inconsistent

         states between the manifest and the repository.


4.  Certificate Re-issuance and Repositories

   If a CA certificate is re-issued, e.g., due to changes in the set of
   resources contained in the number resource extensions, it should not
   be necessary to re-issue all certificates issued under it.  Because
   these certificates contain AIA extensions that point to the
   publication point for the CA certificate, a CA SHOULD use a name for
   its repository publication point that persists across certificate re-
   issuance events.  That is, re-issued CA certificates SHOULD use the
   same repository publication point as previously issued CA
   certificates having the same subject and subject public key, such
   that certificate re-issuance SHOULD intentionally overwrite the
   previously issued certificate within the repository publication
   point.

   It is noted in section Section 2.2 that when a CA performs a key
   rollover the entity SHOULD use a name for its repository publication
   point that persists across key rollover.  In such cases the
   repository publication point will contain the CRLs, and manifests of
   both CA instances as a transient state in the key rollover procedure.
   The RPKI key rollover procedure [I-D.ietf-sidr-keyroll] requires that
   the subordinate products of the old CA are overwritten in the common
   repository publication point by subordinate products issued by the

5.  Synchronising Repositories with a Local Cache

   It is possible to perform the validation-related task of certificate
   path construction using retrieval of individual certificates and
   certificate revocation lists using online retrieval of individual
   certificates, sets of candidate certificates and certificate
   revocation lists based on the AIA, SIA and CRLDP certificate fields.
   This is NOT recommended in circumstances where speed and efficiency
   are relevant considerations.

   To enable efficient validation of RPKI certificates, CRLs, and signed
   objects, it is recommended that each relying party maintain a local
   repository containing a synchronized copy of all valid certificates,
   current certificate revocation lists, and all related signed objects.

   The general approach to repository synchronization is one of a "top-
   down" walk of the distributed repository structure.  This commences
   with the collection of locally selected trust anchor material
   corresponding to the local choice of Trust Anchors, which can be used

   to load the initial set of self-signed resource certificate(s) that
   form the "seed" of this process [I-D.ietf-sidr-ta].  The process then
   populates the local repository cache will all valid certificates that
   have been issued by these issuers.  This procedure can be recursively
   applied to each of these subordinate certificates.  Such a repository
   traversal process SHOULD support a locally configured maximal chain
   length from the initial trust anchors to the current working
   validation point in order to ensure that the process does not follow
   a loop or a non-terminating certificate chain.

   RPs SHOULD ensure that this local synchronization uses the retrieved
   manifests [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-manifests] to ensure that they are
   synchronizing against a current consistent state of each repository
   publication point.  It is noted in Section 3 that a repository
   operator cannot assure RPs that when the repository publication point
   contents are updated that the manifest contents and the repository
   contents will be precisely aligned at all times.  RPs SHOULD use a
   retrieval algorithm that takes this potential for transient
   inconsistency into account.  Possible algorithms for the RP to
   mitigate this situation include performing the synchronization across
   the repository twice in succession, or performing a manifest
   retrieval both before and after the synchronization of the directory
   contents, and repeating the synchronization function if the second
   copy of the manifest differs from the first.


6.  Security Considerations

   Repositories are not assumed to be integrity-protected databases, and
   repository retrieval operations MAY be vulnerable to various forms of
   "man-in-the-middle" attacks.  Corruption of retrieved objects is
   detectable by a relying party through the validation of the signature
   associated with each retrieved object.  Replacement of newer
   instances of an object with an older instance of the same object is
   detectable through the use of manifests.  Insertion of revoked,
   deleted certificates is detected through the retrieval and processing
   of CRLs at scheduled intervals.  However, even the use of manifests
   and CRLs will not allow a relying party to detect all forms of
   substitution attacks based on older (but not expired) valid objects.

   Confidentiality is not provided by the repository, or by the signed
   objects published in the repository.  Data that is subject to
   controlled access should not be included in signed objects in the
   repository unless there is some specified mechanism used to ensure
   the confidentiality of the data contained in the signed object.

7.2.  RPKI Repository Name Scheme Registry

   IANA is requested to create the "RPKI Repository Name Scheme"
   registry.  The registry will contain three-letter filename extensions
   for RPKI repository objects.  The registry's contents is to be
   managed by IETF Review [RFC5226].  The initial contents of this
   register will include the following:

   Filename extension  RPKI Object                     Reference
      .cer             Certificate                     [RFC-to-be]
      .crl             Certificate Revocation List     [RFC-to-be]
      .mft             Manifest                        [RFC-to-be]
      .roa             Route Origination Authorization [RFC-to-be]

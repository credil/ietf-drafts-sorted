      <section title="Overview">
        <t>
	  The YANG module defined within this document specifies
          a small number of event notification messages
          for use within the 'NETCONF' stream, and accessible to
          clients via the subscription mechanism in
          <xref target="RFC5277"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          These notifications pertain to configuration and 
          monitoring portion of the 
          managed system, not the entire system.  A server 
          MUST report events
          that are directly related to the NETCONF protocol.  
          A server MAY
          report events for non-NETCONF management sessions, 
          using the 'session-id' value of zero.
        </t>

          <t>
            This module defines the following notifications
            for the 'NETCONF' stream
            to notify a client application that the
            NETCONF server state has changed:

        The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed
        via the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/>. 
        The lowest NETCONF layer is
        the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement 
        secure transport is SSH, defined in <xref target="RFC6242"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be
        considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
        environments.
        It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via 
        &lt;get&gt;, &lt;get-config&gt;, or &lt;notification&gt;)
        to these data nodes.  These are the
        subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

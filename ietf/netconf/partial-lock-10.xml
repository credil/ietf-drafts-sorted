            <t>The NETCONF protocol defines the lock and unlock RPCs, used to
                lock entire configuration datastores. In some situations, a way
                to lock only parts of a configuration 
                datastore is required. This document defines a capability-based extension to

            The <xref target="NETCONF"/> protocol describes the lock and unlock operations
            that operate on entire configuration datastores. Often,
            multiple management sessions need to be able to modify the 
            configuration of a managed device in parallel. In these cases, locking
            only parts of a configuration 
            datastore is needed. This document defines a capability based extension to the NETCONF protocol to
            support partial locking of the NETCONF running datastore using a mechanism
            based on the existing XPath filtering mechanisms.</t>

            <section title="Overview">
                <t>
                    The :partial-lock capability indicates that the device supports
                    the locking of its configuration with a more limited scope than a complete 
                    configuration datastore. The scope to be locked is specified by using restricted or full XPath expressions.
                    Partial locking only affects configuration data and only the running datastore.
                    The candidate or the start-up datastore are not affected.  
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    The system MUST ensure that configuration resources
                    covered by the lock are not modified by other
                    NETCONF or non-NETCONF management operations such as
                    SNMP and the CLI.
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    The duration of the partial lock begins when the partial lock is
                    granted and lasts until (1) either the corresponding &lt;partial-unlock> operation 
                    succeeds or (2) the NETCONF session terminates.
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    A NETCONF session MAY have multiple parts of the running datastore
                    locked using partial lock operations. 
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    The &lt;partial-lock> operation returns a 
                    lock-id to identify each successfully acquired lock.
                    The lock-id is unique for a NETCONF server for all partial-locks 
                    granted to any NETCONF or non-NETCONF sessions.

                <section title="Usage Scenarios">
                    <t>
                        In the following we describe a few scenarios for partial locking. 
                        Besides the two described here, there 
                        are many other usage scenarios possible.
                    </t>
                  <section title="Multiple managers handling the writable running datastore with overlapping sections">
                        <t>
                            Multiple managers are handling the same NETCONF agent simultaneously. 
                            The agent is handled via the writable running datastore.
                            Each manager has his or her own task, which might involve 
                            the modification of overlapping sections of the datastore. 
                            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                            After collecting and analyzing input and preparing the 
                            NETCONF operations off-line, 
                            the manager locks the areas that are important for his task
                            using one single &lt;partial-lock> operation.
                            The manager executes a number of &lt;edit-config> operations to modify 
                            the configuration, then releases the partial-lock. 
                            The lock should be held for the shortest possible time (e.g. seconds rather then minutes). 
                            The manager should collect all human input before locking anything.
                            As each manager locks only a part of the data model, usually multiple operators can 
                            execute the &lt;edit-config> operations simultaneously.

                        <t>
                            Multiple managers are handling the same NETCONF agent simultaneously. 
                            The agent is handled via the writable running datastore.
                            The agent's data model contains a number of well defined separate
                            areas that can be configured without impacting other areas. An
                            example can be a server with multiple applications running on it, or
                            a number of a network elements with a common NETCONF agent for
                            management.                            
                            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                            Each manager has his or her own task, which does not involve the modification 
                            of overlapping sections of the datastore. 
                            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                            The manager locks his area with a &lt;partial-lock> operation, 
                            uses a number of &lt;edit-config> commands to modify it, 
                            later releases the lock.
                            As each manager has his functional area assigned to him, 
                            and he locks only that area, multiple managers can edit 
                            the configuration simultaneously.
                            Locks can be held for extended periods (e.g. minutes, hours), 
                            as this will not hinder other managers.

                            This scenario assumes that the global lock operation 
                            from <xref target="NETCONF"/> is not used.

                    The &lt;partial-lock> operation allows the client to lock a portion of
                    the running datastore. The portion to lock is specified with XPath 
                    expressions in the "select" elements  
                    in the &lt;partial-lock> operation. Each XPath expression 
                    MUST return a node set. 
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    When a NETCONF session holds a lock on a node, no other session or
                    non-NETCONF mechanism of the system can change that node or any node
                    in the hierarchy of nodes beneath it.
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    Locking a node protects the node itself and 
                    the complete subtree under the node from modification by others. 
                    The set of locked nodes is called the scope of the lock, while all the 
                    locked nodes and the nodes in the subtrees under them make up the protected area.
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    The XPath expressions are evaluated only once at lock time. 
                    Thereafter, the scope of the lock is maintained as a set of nodes, 
                    i.e. the returned nodeset, and not by the XPath expression. 
                    If the configuration data is later altered in a way that 
                    would make the original XPath  
                    expressions evaluate to a different set of nodes, this does not affect the 
                    scope of the partial lock.  
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    Let's say the agent's data model includes a list of interface nodes. 
                    If the XPath expression in the partial lock operation covers all interface nodes at locking, 
                    the scope of the lock will be maintained as the list of interface nodes at the time 
                    when the lock was granted. If someone later creates a new interface, this new
                    interface will not be included in the locked-nodes list created 
                    previously so the new interface will not be locked.
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    A &lt;partial-lock> operation MUST be handled atomically by the NETCONF 
                    server. The server either locks all requested parts of the datastore or none.  
                    If during the &lt;partial-lock> operation one of the requested parts cannot be locked, the 
                    server MUST unlock all parts that have already been locked during that operation. 
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    If a node in the scope of the lock is deleted by the session owning the lock, it is removed from the 
                    scope of the lock, so any other session or non-NETCONF mechanism can recreate it. 
                    If all nodes in the scope of the lock are deleted, the 
                    lock will still be present. However, its scope will become empty (since the lock will 
                    not cover any nodes).
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    A NETCONF server that supports partial locking MUST be able to grant multiple simultaneous partial locks to a 
                    single NETCONF session. If the protected area of the individual locks overlap, nodes in the 
                    common area MUST be protected until all of the overlapping locks are released.                    
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                    A partial lock operation MUST fail if:
                   <list style="symbols">
                       <t>Any NETCONF session (including the current session) owns the

                       <t>Any part of the area to be protected is already locked (or protected by partial locking) 
                           by another management session, including other NETCONF sessions using

                     <t>The requesting user is not successfully authenticated.</t>
                     <t>The NETCONF server implements access control, and the locking user 
                           does not have sufficient 
                            access rights. The exact handling of access rights is outside the 
                            scope of this document, but it is assumed that there is an access 
                            control system that MAY deny or allow the partial lock operation.</t>
                   </list>
                    The &lt;partial-lock> operation is designed for simplicity, so when a partial 
                    lock is executed you get what you asked for: a set of nodes that are 
                    locked for writing. As a consequence users must observe the following: 
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>Locking does not affect read operations.</t>
                        <t>If part of the running datastore is locked, this has no effect on any unlocked parts of the datastore. 
                            If this is a problem (e.g., changes depend on data values or nodes outside the protected  
                            part of the datastore), these nodes SHOULD be included in the protected area of the lock.</t>
                        <t>Configuration data can be edited both inside and outside the protected area of a 
                            lock. It is the responsibility of the NETCONF client application to lock all relevant parts of the datastore that 
                            are crucial for a specific management action.</t>

                    Note: The &lt;partial-lock> operation does not modify the global &lt;lock> operation defined in the base

                    datastore is already locked by &lt;partial-lock>, then a global lock for the running datastore MUST fail even 
                    if the global lock is requested by the NETCONF session that owns the partial lock.

                         parts of the configuration could become dead-locked. 
                         To avoid this situation, clients SHOULD lock
                         everything they need in one operation. If locking fails, the client
                         MUST back-off, release any previously acquired locks, and SHOULD
                         retry the procedure after waiting some randomized time interval.

            The same considerations are relevant as for the base NETCONF Protocol  <xref target="NETCONF"></xref>.
            &lt;partial-lock> and &lt;partial-unlock> RPCs MUST only be allowed for an authenticated user.
            &lt;partial-lock> and &lt;partial-unlock> RPCs SHOULD only be allowed for an authorized user. 
            However as NETCONF access control is not standardized and not a mandatory part 
            of a NETCONF implementation, it is strongly recommended, 
            but OPTIONAL. (although nearly all implementations include some kind of access control)          
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            A lock (either a partial lock or a global lock) might prevent other users from configuring the system.
            The following mechanisms are in place to prevent the misuse of this possibility:
            <list>
              <t>A user, that is not successfully authenticated, MUST NOT be granted a partial lock.</t>
              <t>Only an authorized user SHOULD be able to request a partial lock.</t>
              <t>The partial lock is automatically released when a session is terminated regardless of how the session ends.</t>
                <t>The &lt;kill-session> operation makes it possible to terminate other users's sessions.</t>
                <t>The NETCONF server MAY log partial lock requests in an audit trail.</t>
                <t></t>
            </list>
            A lock that is hung for some reason (e.g., a broken TCP connection that the server has not yet recognised) can be released 
            using another NETCONF session by explicitly killing the session owning that lock using the &lt;kill-session> operation.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Partial locking is not an authorization mechanism; it SHOULD NOT be used to provide security or access control. 
            Partial locking SHOULD only be used as a mechanism for providing consistency 
            when multiple managers are trying to configure the node.
            It is vital that users easily understand the exact scope of a lock. 
            This is why the scope is determined when granting a lock and is not modified thereafter.

            <t>
                Partial lock cannot be used to lock non-existent nodes, which would effectively attempt to reserve them for future use. 
                To guarantee that a node cannot be created by some other session, the
                parent node should be locked, the top level node of the new subtree created, and then locked 
                with another &lt;partial-lock> operation. After this, the lock on the parent node should be removed.
            </t>
            <t>In this chapter an example illustrating the above is given.
                <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                We want to create &lt;user> Joe under &lt;users>, and start editing it. 
                Editing might take a number of minutes.
                We want to immediately lock Joe so no one will touch it before we are finished with the editing. 
                <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                We also want to minimize locking other parts of the running datastore as multiple managers might 
                be adding users near simultaneously.
                <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                First we check what users are already defined.

                We want to add the new user "Joe" and immediately lock him 
                using partial locking. The way to do this, is to first lock all &lt;user> nodes by locking the &lt;users> node.
                <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                Note that if we would lock all the &lt;user> nodes using the select 
                expression '/usr:top/usr:users/usr:user' ; this would not lock the new user "Joe", which we will create after locking. 
                So we rather have to lock the &lt;users> node.

                The NETCONF server grants the partial lock. The scope

                        <t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) defined 
                            in this document provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, 
                            and delete the configuration of network devices.  It uses an 
                            Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based data encoding for the configuration 
                            data as well as the protocol messages.  The NETCONF protocol operations 
                            are realized on top of a simple Remote Procedure Call (RPC) 
                            layer. [STANDARDS TRACK]

                            In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
                            the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
                            capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
                            interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
                            should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
                            
                            <list>
                                <t>
                                    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
                                    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
                                    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
                                    RFC 2119.
                                </t></list></t>
                        <t>
                            Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
                            level of the document in which they are used.

   <t>
    The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use
    with the NETCONF protocol requires a structured and secure
    operating environment that promotes human usability and
    multi-vendor interoperability.  There is a need for standard
    mechanisms to restrict NETCONF protocol access for particular
    users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol
    operations and content.  This document defines such an access
    control model.

    <t>
      The NETCONF protocol does not provide any standard mechanisms to
      restrict the protocol operations and content that each user is

      There is a need for inter-operable management of the
      controlled access to administrator selected portions of the
      available NETCONF content within a particular server.

      This document addresses access control mechanisms for the
      Operation and Content layers of NETCONF, as defined in <xref

    <section title="Access Control Points">
      <t>
        NETCONF allows new protocol operations to be
        added at any time, and the YANG data modeling language
        supports this feature.  It is not possible to
        design an ACM for NETCONF that
        only focuses on a static set of protocol operations,
        like some other protocols.  Since few assumptions
        can be made about an arbitrary protocol operation,
        the NETCONF architectural server components need to
        be protected at three conceptual control points.

          </t>
        </list>
      </t>           
    </section>
    <section title="Simplicity">
      <t>
        There is concern that a complicated ACM will not
        be widely deployed, because it is too hard to use.
        It needs to be easy to do simple things, and possible to do
        complex things, instead of hard to do everything.
      </t>
      <t>
        Configuration of the access control system needs to be as
        simple as possible.  Simple and common tasks need to be easy
        to configure, and require little expertise or domain-specific
        knowledge.  Complex tasks are possible using additional
        mechanisms, which may require additional expertise.
      </t>
      <t>
        A single set of access control rules ought to be able
        to control all types of NETCONF protocol operation invocation, 
        all datastore access, and all notification events.
      </t>
      <t>
        Access control ought to be defined with a small and familiar 
        set of permissions, while still allowing full control
        of NETCONF datastore access.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Procedural Interface">
      <t>
        The NETCONF protocol uses a remote procedure call model,
        and an extensible set of protocol operations.
        Access control for any possible protocol operation is necessary.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Datastore Access">
      <t>
        It is necessary to control access to specific nodes and
        subtrees within the NETCONF datastore, regardless of which
        protocol operation, standard or proprietary, was used to
        access the datastore.
      </t>
    </section>
      
    <section title="Users and Groups">
      <t>
        It is necessary that access control rules for a single user or
        a configurable group of users can be configured.
      </t>
      <t>
        The ACM needs to support the concept of administrative groups,
        to support the well-established distinction between
        a root account and other types of less-privileged
        conceptual user accounts.
        These groups needs to be configurable by the administrator.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is necessary that the user-to-group mapping can be delegated to a
        central server, such as a RADIUS server <xref
        target="RFC2865"/> <xref target="RFC5607"/>.  Since
        authentication is performed by the NETCONF transport layer,
        and RADIUS performs authentication and service authorization
        at the same time, the underlying NETCONF transport needs to be
        able to report a set of group names associated with the user
        to the server.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Maintenance">
      <t>
        It ought to be possible to disable part or all of the
        access control model without deleting any 
        access control rules.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Configuration Capabilities">
      <t>
        Suitable configuration and monitoring mechanisms
        are needed to allow an administrator to easily manage all
        aspects of the ACM behavior. A standard data model,
        suitable for use with the &lt;edit-config&gt; 
        protocol operation
        needs to be available for this purpose.
      </t>
      <t>
        Access control rules to restrict access operations on specific 
        subtrees within the configuration datastore needs to
        be supported.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Identifying Security-Sensitive Content">
      <t>
        One of the most important aspects of the data model
        documentation, and biggest concerns during deployment,
        is the identification of security-sensitive content.
        This applies to protocol operations in NETCONF, not just data
        and notifications.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is mandatory for security-sensitive objects
        to be documented in the Security Considerations
        section of an RFC.  This is nice, but it
        is not good enough, for the following reasons:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            This documentation-only approach forces administrators to
            study the RFC and determine if there are any
            potential security risks introduced by a new
            data model.
          </t>
          <t>
            If any security risks are identified, then 
            the administrator can study some more RFC text, 
            and determine how to mitigate the security risk(s).
          </t>
          <t>
            The ACM on each server can be configured to
            mitigate the security risks, e.g., require
            privileged access to read or write the
            specific data identified in the Security
            Considerations section.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the ACM is not pre-configured, then there
            will be a time window of vulnerability,
            after the new data model is loaded, and before
            the new access control rules for that data model
            are configured, enabled, and debugged.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Often, the administrator just wants to disable
        default access to the secure content, so
        no inadvertent or malicious changes can be made
        to the server.  This allows the default rules
        to be more lenient, without significantly
        increasing the security risk.
      </t>
      <t>
        A data model designer needs to be able to 
        use machine-readable statements to identify
        NETCONF content which needs to be protected by default.
        This will allow client and server tools to automatically
        identify data-model specific security risks, by
        denying access to sensitive data unless the user is
        explicitly authorized to perform the requested access operation.

  <section title="NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM)"
	   anchor="acm">
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This section provides a high-level overview of the
        access control model structure.  It describes the
        NETCONF protocol message processing model, and the conceptual
        access control requirements within that model.
      </t>

      <section title="Features">
        <t>
          The NACM data model provides the following features:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Independent control of RPC, data, and notification
              access.
            </t>
            <t>
              Simple access control rules configuration
              data model that is easy to use.
            </t>
            <t>
              The concept of an emergency recovery session 
              is supported, but configuration of the server
              for this purpose is beyond the scope of this document.
              An emergency recovery session will bypass all access 
              control enforcement, in order to allow it to 
              initialize or repair the NACM configuration.
            </t>
            <t>
              A simple and familiar set of datastore permissions is
              used.
            </t>
            <t>
              Support for YANG security tagging (e.g.,
              "nacm:default-deny-write" statement) allows default
              security modes to automatically exclude sensitive data.
            </t>
            <t>
              Separate default access modes for read, write, and
              execute permissions.
            </t>
            <t>
              Access control rules are applied to configurable groups
              of users.
            </t>
            <t>
              The entire ACM can be disabled during
              operation, in order to debug operational problems.
            </t>
            <t>
              Access control rules are simple to configure.
            </t>
            <t>
              The number of denied protocol operation requests
              and denied datastore write requests can be
              monitored by the client.
            </t>
            <t>
              Simple unconstrained YANG instance identifiers
              are used to configure access control rules for
              specific data nodes.

      <t>
        The same access control rules apply to all
        datastores.  For example, the candidate configuration
        datastore or the running configuration datastore.
      </t>
      <t>
        Only the standard NETCONF datastores (candidate, running,
        and startup) are controlled by NACM.  Local or remote
        files or datastores accessed via the &lt;url&gt;
        parameter are not controlled by NACM.

      <section title="Access Rights">
        <t>
          A small set of hard-wired datastore access rights is needed
          to control access to all possible NETCONF protocol operations,
          including vendor extensions to the standard protocol operation set.
        </t>
        <t>
          The "CRUDX" model can support all NETCONF 
          protocol operations:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Create:  Allows the client to add a new data node 
              instance to a datastore.
            </t>
            <t>
              Read: Allows the client to read a data node instance

            <t>

      <section title="&lt;get&gt; and &lt;get-config&gt; Operations">
        <t>
          Data nodes to which the client does not have read access are
          silently omitted from the &lt;rpc-reply&gt; message.  This
          is done to allow NETCONF filters for &lt;get&gt; and
          &lt;get-config&gt; to function properly, instead of causing
          an "access-denied" error because the filter criteria would
          otherwise include unauthorized read access to some data
          nodes.  For NETCONF filtering purposes, the selection
          criteria is applied to the subset of nodes that the user is
          authorized to read, not the entire datastore.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="&lt;edit-config&gt; Operation">
        <t>
          The NACM access rights are not directly coupled to the
          &lt;edit-config&gt; "operation" attribute, although they are
          similar.  Instead, a NACM access right applies to all
          protocol operations which would result in a particular access
          operation to the target datastore. This section describes
          how these access rights apply to the specific access
          operations supported by the &lt;edit-config&gt; protocol operation.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the effective access operation is "none"
          (i.e., default-operation="none")
          for a particular data node, 
          then no access control is applied to that data node.
          This is required to allow access to a sub-tree within
          larger data structure.  For example, a user may be
          authorized to create a new "/interfaces/interface" list entry,
          but not be authorized to create or delete its
          parent container ("/interfaces").
          If the "/interfaces" container already exists in
          the target datastore, then the effective operation
          will be "none" for the "/interfaces" node if an
          "/interfaces/interface" list entry is edited.
        </t>
	<t>
	  If the protocol operation would result in the
	  creation of a data store node, and the user does not
	  have "create" access permission for that node, the
	  protocol operation is rejected with an
	  "access-denied" error.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the protocol operation would result in the
	  deletion of a data store node, and the user does not
	  have "delete" access permission for that node, the
	  protocol operation is rejected with an
	  "access-denied" error.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the protocol operation would result in the

          operation on a datastore node that would result in the
          creation of a new data node instance is a "create" access
          operation.  A "create" access operation for which the user

          A "merge" or "replace" &lt;edit-config&gt; operation may
          include data nodes which do not alter portions of the

          may be present for naming purposes, but does not actually
          alter the corresponding datastore node.  These unaltered
          data nodes are ignored by the server, and do not require any
          access rights by the client.

        <t>
          A "merge" &lt;edit-config&gt; operation may include data
          nodes, but not include particular child data nodes that are

          the scope of a "merge" &lt;edit-config&gt; operation are
          ignored by the server, and do not require any access rights

    <section title="Model Components">
      <t>
        This section defines the conceptual components
        related to access control model.
      </t>

     <section title="Users">
       <t>
         A "user" is the conceptual entity that is associated
         with the access permissions granted to a particular session.
         A user is identified by a string which is unique 
         within the server.
       </t>
       <t>
         As described in <xref target="RFC6241"/>,
         the user name string is derived from the transport layer
         during session establishment.  If the transport layer cannot
         authenticate the user, the session is terminated.
       </t>
       <t>
         The server MAY support a "recovery session" mechanism,
         which will bypass all access control enforcement.
         This is useful for restricting initial access
         and repairing a broken access control configuration.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Groups">
       <t>
         Access to a specific NETCONF protocol operation is granted to
         a session, associated with a group, not a user.
       </t>
       <t>
         A group is identified by its name.  All group names are
         unique within the server.
       </t>
       <t>
         A group member is identified by a user name string.

   <section title="Access Control Enforcement Procedures">
     <t>
       There are seven separate phases that need to be addressed,
       four of which are related to the NETCONF message processing model.
       In addition, the initial start-up mode for a NETCONF server,
       session establishment, and "access-denied" error handling
       procedures also need to be considered.
     </t>
     <t>
       The server MUST use the access control rules in effect
       at the time it starts processing the message.
       The same access control rules MUST stay in effect for
       the processing of the entire message.
     </t>

     <section title="Initial Operation">
       <t>
         Upon the very first start-up of the NETCONF server,
         the access control configuration will probably
         not be present.  If it isn't,
         a server MUST NOT allow any write access to
         any session role except a "recovery session".
       </t>
       <t>
	 Access rules are enforced any time a
         request is initiated from a user session.
         Access control is not enforced for 
         server-initiated access requests, such as the
         initial load of the running datastore, during bootup.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Session Establishment">
       <t>
         The access control model applies specifically
         to the well-formed XML content transferred between a client
         and a server, after session establishment has been completed,
         and after the &lt;hello&gt; exchange has been successfully
         completed.
       </t>
       <t>
         Once session establishment is completed, and a user
         has been authenticated, the NETCONF transport layer reports
         the user name and a possibly empty set of group names
         associated with the user to the NETCONF server.  The NETCONF
         server will enforce the access control rules, based on the
         supplied user name, group names, and the configuration
         data stored on the server.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title='"access-denied" Error Handling'>
       <t>
         The "access-denied" error-tag is generated when
         the access control system denies access to either a
         request to invoke a protocol operation or a request to
         perform a particular access operation on the configuration
         datastore.
       </t>
       <t>
         A server MUST NOT include any sensitive information
         in any &lt;error-info&gt; elements within the 
         &lt;rpc-error&gt; response.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Incoming RPC Message Validation">
       <t>
         The diagram below shows the basic 
         conceptual structure of the access control processing model
         for incoming NETCONF &lt;rpc&gt; messages, within a server.

       <t>
         After the server validates the &lt;rpc&gt; element,

         name of the protocol operation being requested, the server
         verifies that the user is authorized

             a "user-name" entry that equals the user name for
             the session making the request.  Add to these groups the
             set of groups provided by the transport layer.

         By default, "read" access to all datastore contents enabled,
         (unless "nacm:default-deny-all" is specified for the data definition)
         and "exec" access is enabled for safe protocol operations.
         An administrator needs to ensure that NACM is enabled,
         and also decide if the default access parameters are 
         set appropriately.  Make sure the following data nodes
         are properly configured:
         <list style="symbols">
           <t>/nacm/enable-nacm (default "true")</t>
           <t>/nacm/read-default (default "permit")</t>
           <t>/nacm/write-default (default "deny")</t>
           <t>/nacm/exec-default (default "permit")</t>
         </list>
       </t>
       <t>
         An administrator needs to restrict write access to all
         configurable objects within this data model.
       </t>
       <t>
         If write access is allowed for configuration of
         access control rules, then care needs to be taken
         not to disrupt the access control enforcement.
         For example, if the NACM access control rules are edited directly
         within the running configuration datastore (i.e.,
         :writable-running capability is supported and used),
         then care needs to be taken not to allow unintended
         access while the edits are being done.
       </t>
       <t>
         An administrator needs to make sure that
         the translation from a transport or implementation
         dependant user identity to a NACM user name is unique
         and correct.
         This requirement is specified in detail in section 2.2
         of <xref target="RFC6241"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
         An administrator needs to be aware that the YANG data structures
         representing access control rules (/nacm/rule-list 
         and /nacm/rule-list/rule)
         are ordered by the client.  The server will evaluate the
         access control rules according to their relative conceptual order
         within the running datastore configuration.
       </t>
       <t>
         Note that the /nacm/groups data structure contains
         the administrative group names used by the server.
         These group names may be configured locally and/or
         provided through an external protocol, such as RADIUS
         <xref target="RFC2865"/> <xref target="RFC5607"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
         An administrator needs to restrict read access to the
         following objects within this data model, which reveal
         access control configuration which could be considered
         sensitive.
         <list style="symbols">

     <section title="General Configuration Issues">
       <t>
         There is a risk that invocation of 
         non-standard protocol operations will have undocumented side effects.
         An administrator needs to construct access control rules
         such that the configuration datastore is protected
         from such side effects.
       </t>
       <t>
         It is possible for a session with some write access
         (e.g., allowed to invoke &lt;edit-config&gt;),
         but without any access to a particular datastore subtree
         containing sensitive data, to determine the presence
         or non-presence of that data.  
         This can be done by repeatedly issuing
         some sort of edit request (create, update, or delete)
         and possibly receiving "access-denied" errors in response.
         These "fishing" attacks can identify the presence or 
         non-presence of specific sensitive data even without 
         the "error-path" field being present within the "rpc-error"
         response.
       </t>
       <t>
         It may be possible for the set of NETCONF capabilities
         on the server to change over time.  If so, then there is a risk
         that new protocol operations, notifications, and/or
         datastore content have been added to the device.
         An administrator needs to be sure the access control
         rules are correct for the new content in this case.
         Mechanisms to detect NETCONF capability changes on
         a specific device are outside the scope of this document.
       </t>
       <t>
         It is possible that the data model definition itself
         (e.g., YANG when-stmt) will help an unauthorized session
         determine the presence or even value of sensitive data nodes
         by examining the presence and values of different data nodes.
       </t>
       <t>
         There is a risk that non-standard protocol operations, or
         even the standard &lt;get&gt; protocol operation, may
         return data which "aliases" or "copies" sensitive data
         from a different data object.  There may simply be
         multiple data model definitions which expose
         or even configure the same underlying system
         instrumentation.
       </t>
       <t>
         A data model may contain external keys
         (e.g., YANG leafref), which expose values
         from a different data structure.
         An administrator needs to
         be aware of sensitive data models which contain leafref nodes.
         This entails finding all the leafref objects that
         "point" at the sensitive data (i.e., "path-stmt" values) that 
         implicitly or explicitly include the sensitive data node.
       </t>
       <t>
         It is beyond the scope of this document to define access 
         control enforcement
         procedures for underlying device instrumentation that may
         exist to support the NETCONF server operation.  An administrator
         can identify each protocol operation that the server provides,
         and decide if it needs any access control applied to it.
       </t>
       <t>
         This document incorporates the optional use of a "recovery session"
         mechanism, which can be used to bypass access control
         enforcement in emergencies, such as NACM configuration errors
         which disable all access to the server. 
         The configuration and identification of such
         a recovery session mechanism are implementation-specific
         and outside the scope of this document.
         An administrator needs to be aware of any "recovery session"
         mechanisms available on the device, and make sure they
         are used appropriately.
       </t>
       <t>
         It is possible for a session to disrupt configuration
         management, even without any write access to the configuration,
         by locking the datastore. This may be done to insure all or 
         part of the configuration  remains stable while it is being
         retrieved, or it may be done as a "denial-of-service" attack.
         There is no way for the server to know the difference.
         An administrator may wish to
         restrict "exec" access to the following protocol operations:
         <list style="symbols">
           <t>&lt;lock&gt;</t>
           <t>&lt;unlock&gt;</t>
           <t>&lt;partial-lock&gt;</t>
           <t>&lt;partial-unlock&gt;</t>
         </list>
       </t>
     </section>
     <section title="Data Model Design Considerations">
       <t>
         Designers need to clearly identify any sensitive data,
         notifications, or protocol operations defined within a YANG
         module.  For such definitions, a "nacm:default-deny-write" or
         "nacm:default-deny-all" statement SHOULD be present, in
         addition to a clear description of the security risks.
       </t>
       <t>
         Protocol operations need to be properly documented by the
         data model designer, so it is clear to administrators what
         data nodes (if any) are affected by the protocol operation,
         and what information (if any) is returned in the
         &lt;rpc-reply&gt; message.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Data models ought to be designed so that different access
	 levels for input parameters to protocol operations is not required.
	 Use of generic protocol operations should be avoided, and separate
	 protocol operations defined instead, if different access levels 
	 are needed.

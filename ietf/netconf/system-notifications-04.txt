           Network Configuration Protocol Base Notifications
               draft-ietf-netconf-system-notifications-04

Abstract

   The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration
   datastores.  However, client applications often need to be aware of
   common events such as a change in NETCONF server capabilities, that
   may impact management applications.  Standard mechanisms are needed
   to support the monitoring of the base system events within the
   NETCONF server.  This document defines a YANG module that allows a
   NETCONF client to receive notifications for some common system
   events.

Internet-Draft         NETCONF Base Notifications              June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The NETCONF protocol [I-D.ietf-netconf-4741bis] provides mechanisms
   to manipulate configuration datastores.  However, client applications
   often need to be aware of common events such as a change in NETCONF
   server capabilities, that may impact management applications.
   Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the base
   system events within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a
   YANG module [RFC6020] that allows a NETCONF client to receive
   notifications for some common system events.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-4741bis]:
   o  client
   o  datastore
   o  operation
   o  server

   The following terms are defined in [RFC5277]:
   o  event
   o  stream
   o  subscription

   The following term is defined in [RFC6020]:
   o  data node


2.  YANG Module for NETCONF Base Notifications

2.1.  Overview

   The YANG module defined within this document specifies a small number
   of notification event messages for use within the 'NETCONF' stream,
   and accessible to clients via the subscription mechanism in
   [RFC5277].

   These notifications pertain to configuration and monitoring portion
   of the managed system, not the entire system.  A server MUST report
   events that are directly related to the NETCONF protocol.  A server
   MAY report events for non-NETCONF management sessions, using the
   'session-id' value of zero.

   The YANG language is defined in [RFC6020].

2.1.1.  Notifications

   This module defines some events for the 'NETCONF' stream to notify a
   client application that the NETCONF server state has changed.
   netconf-config-change:
      Generated when the NETCONF server detects that the <running> or
      <startup> configuration datastore has changed.  Summarizes each
      edit being reported.
   netconf-capability-change:
      Generated when the NETCONF server detects that the server
      capabilities have changed.  Indicates which capabilities have been
      added, deleted, and/or modified.
   netconf-session-start:
      Generated when a NETCONF server detects that a NETCONF session has
      started.  A server MAY generate this event for non-NETCONF
      management sessions.  Indicates the identity of the user that
      started the session.
   netconf-session-end:
      Generated when a NETCONF server detects that a NETCONF session has
      terminated.  A server MAY optionally generate this event for non-
      NETCONF management sessions.  Indicates the identity of the user
      that owned the session, and why the session was terminated.
   netconf-confirmed-commit:
      Generated when a NETCONF server detects that a confirmed-commit
      event has occurred.  Indicates the event and the current state of
      the confirmed-commit operation in progress.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC4741].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC4742].

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via <get>, <get-config>, or
   <notification>) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /netconf-config-change:
      Event type itself indicates that the system configuration has
      changed, and may be now be vulnerable to unspecified attacks.
   /netconf-config-change/changed-by:
      Indicates whether the server or a specific user management session
      made the configuration change.  Identifies the user name,
      session-id, and source host address associated with the
      configuration change, if any.

   /netconf-config-change/datastore:
      Indicates which datastore has been changed.  This data can be used
      to determine if the non-volatile startup configuration data has
      been changed.
   /netconf-config-change/edit:
      Identifies the specific edit operations and specific datastore
      subtree(s) that have changed.  This data could be used to
      determine if specific server vulnerabilities may now be present.

   /netconf-capability-change:
      Event type itself indicates that the system capabilities have
      changed, and may be now be vulnerable to unspecified attacks.
   /netconf-capability-change/changed-by:
      Indicates whether the server or a specific user management session
      made the capability change.  Identifies the user name, session-id,
      and source host address associated with the capability change, if
      any.
   /netconf-capability-change/added-capability:
      Indicates the specific capability URIs that have been added.  This
      data could be used to determine if specific server vulnerabilities
      may now be present.
   /netconf-capability-change/deleted-capability:
      Indicates the specific capability URIs that have been deleted.
      This data could be used to determine if specific server
      vulnerabilities may now be present.
   /netconf-capability-change/modified-capability:
      Indicates the specific capability URIs that have been modified.
      This data could be used to determine if specific server
      vulnerabilities may now be present.

   /netconf-session-start:
      Event type itself indicates that a NETCONF or other management
      session may start altering the device configuration and/or state.
   /netconf-session-start/username:
      Indicates the user name associated with the session.
   /netconf-session-start/source-host:
      Indicates the source host address associated with the session.

   /netconf-session-end:
      Event type itself indicates that a NETCONF or other management
      session may be finished altering the device configuration and/or
      state.
   /netconf-session-end/username:
      Indicates the user name associated with the session.

   /netconf-session-end/source-host:
      Indicates the source host address associated with the session.

   /netconf-confirmed-commit:
      Event type itself indicates that the <running> datastore may have
      changed.
   /netconf-confirmed-commit/username:
      Indicates the user name associated with the session.
   /netconf-confirmed-commit/source-host:
      Indicates the source host address associated with the session.
   /netconf-confirmed-commit/confirm-event:
      Indicates the specific confirmed-commit state change that
      occurred.  A value of 'complete' probably indicates that the
      <running> datastore has changed.
   /netconf-confirmed-commit/timeout:
      Indicates the number of seconds in the future when the <running>
      datastore may change, due to the server reverting to an older
      configuration.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   -- RFC Ed.: remove this section before publication.

A.1.  03-04

   Renamed module to NETCONF Base Notifications.  The module is now
   ietf-netconf-base-notifications.  The namespace and prefix are now
   changed as well.

   Changed notifications so a server can report non-NETCONF initiated
   events.

   Replaced security considerations, according to template in RFC 6087.

   Added Acknowledgements section.

A.2.  02-03

   Renamed module back to NETCONF system notifications.  The module is
   now ietf-netconf-system-notifications.  The namespace and prefix are
   now changed as well.

   Leaf user-name is now username, and is now mandatory, to be
   consistent with netconf monitoring module.

   Leaf remote-host is now source-host to be consistent with netconf
   monitoring module.

   The changed-by choice (server-or-user) is now mandatory.

   The netconf-config-change description was updated and leaf target-
   database is now named target-datastore.

   Term 'database' changed to term 'datastore' in text.

   netconf-confirmed-commit: changed uses common-session-parms to use
   when-stmt not refine-stmt.

   netconf-capability-change: updated description text.

A.3.  01-02

   Renamed module NETCONF Events instead of NETCONF system
   notifications.  Note that ietf-netconf-notifications is being
   reserved for the XML content defined in RFC 5277.

   Made changes based on mailing list comments and latest WG consensus.

   Filled in IANA section.

A.4.  00-01

   Removed sys-startup notification.

   Make changed-by into a grouping, and added usage to sys-config-change
   notification.

   Added target-database leaf to sys-config-change to distinguish
   between running and startup changes.

   Removed 'bad-start' from termination-reason leaf in sys-session-end
   notification.

A.5.  00

   Initial version, based on
   draft-bierman-netconf-system-monitoring-00.txt.

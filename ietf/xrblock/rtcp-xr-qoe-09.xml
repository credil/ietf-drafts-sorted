        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Architectures <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref> provides guidelines for reporting block
        format using RTCP XR. The XR block type described in this document are
        in accordance with the guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        and <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>The QoE Metrics Report Block can be used in any application of RTP
        for which QoE measurement algorithms are defined.</t>

        <t>The factors that affect real-time audio/video application quality
        can be split into two categories. The first category consists of
        transport-specific factors such as packet loss, delay and jitter
        (which also translates into losses in the playback buffer). The
        factors in the second category are application-specific factors that
        affect real time application (e.g., video) quality. These factors can
        be but are not limited to video codec and loss recovery technique,
        coding bit rate, packetization scheme, and content characteristics.
        </t>

        <t>Compared with application-specific factors, the transport-specific
        factors sometimes are not sufficient to measure real time media
        quality, since the ability to analyze the real time media in the
        application layer provides quantifiable measurements for end user
        Quality of Experience (QoE) that may not be captured in the
        transmission layers or from the RTP layer down. In a typical scenario,
        monitoring of the transmission layers can produce statistics
        suggesting that quality is not an issue, such as the fact that network
        jitter is not excessive. However, problems may occur in the service
        layers leading to poor subscriber QoE. Therefore monitoring using only
        network-level measurements may be insufficient when application layer
        media quality is required. </t>

        <t>In order to provide accurate measures of real time media quality
        when transporting real time media across a network, the QoE Metrics is
        highly required which can be conveyed in the RTCP XR packets [RFC3611]
        and may have the following three benefits: <vspace
        blankLines="1" /><list style="symbols">
            <t>Tuning the content encoder algorithm to satisfy real time data
            quality requirements.</t>

            <t>Determining which system techniques to use in a given situation
            and when to switch from one technique to another as system
            parameters change.</t>

            <t>Verifying the continued correct operation of an existing
            system.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <section title="Standards Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>The terminology used is <vspace blankLines="1" /><list>
            <t>Numeric formats S X:Y<vspace blankLines="1" /><list>
                <t>where S indicates a two's complement signed representation,
                X the number of bits prior to the decimal place and Y the
                number of bits after the decimal place.</t>

                <t>Hence 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0 to
                255.996 with a granularity of 0.0039. S7:8 would represent the
                range -127.996 to +127.996. 0:16 represents a proper binary
                fraction with range</t>

                <t>0.0 to 1 - 1/65536 = 0.9999847</t>

                <t>though note that use of flag values at the top of the
                numeric range slightly reduces this upper limit. For example,
                if the 16- bit values 0xfffe and 0xffff are used as flags for
                "over-range" and "unavailable" conditions, a 0:16 quantity has
                range</t>

                <t>0.0 to 1 - 3/65536 = 0.9999542</t>

    <section anchor="SMQM" title="QoE Metrics Block">
      <t>Multimedia application QoE metric is commonly expressed as a MOS
      ("Mean Opinion Score"), MOS is on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5
      represents excellent and 1 represents unacceptable. MOS scores are
      usually obtained using subjective testing or using objective algorithm.
      However Subjective testing to estimate the multimedia quality may be not
      suitable for measuring the multimedia quality since the results may vary
      from test to test. Therefore using objective algorithm to calculate MOS
      scores is RECOMMENDED. ITU-T recommendations (e.g., <xref
      target="G.107"></xref><xref target="G.107.1"></xref><xref
      target="P.862"></xref><xref target="P.862.1"></xref><xref
      target="P.862.2"></xref><xref target="P.863"></xref><xref
      target="P.564"></xref><xref target="G.1082"></xref><xref
      target="P.1201.1"></xref><xref target="P.1201.2"></xref><xref
      target="P.1202.1"></xref><xref target="P.1202.2"></xref>) define the
      methodologies for assessment of the performance of multimedia stream and
      provides a method to evaluate QoE estimation algorithms and objective
      model for video and audio. Hence this document recommends vendors and
      implementers to use these International Telecommunication Union
      (ITU)-specified methodologies to measure parameters when possible.
      <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

      <t>This block reports the multimedia application performance or media
      quality beyond the information carried in the standard RTCP packet
      format. Information is recorded about QoE metric which provides a
      measure that gives a numerical indication of the perceived quality of
      the media received. The measurement of metrics in this block are usually
      made at the receiving end of the RTP stream. Instances of this Metrics
      Block refer by Synchronization source (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary
      Measurement Information block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref> which
      describes measurement periods in use (see RFC6776 section 4.2).</t>

      <t>This Metrics Block relies on the measurement period in the
      Measurement Information block indicating the span of the report. Senders
      MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the measurement
      information block. Receivers MUST verify that the measurement period is
      received in the same compound RTCP packet as this Metrics Block. If not,
      this Metrics Block MUST be discarded.</t>

      <section title="Metric Block Structure">
        <t>The report block contents are dependent upon a series of flag bits
        carried in the first part of the header. Not all parameters need to be
        reported in each block. Flags indicate which are and which are not
        reported. The fields corresponding to unreported parameters MUST be
        present, and MUST be set to zero. The receiver MUST ignore any QoE
        Metrics Block with a non-zero value in any field flagged as
        unreported. The encoding of QoE metrics block payload consists of a
        series of 32 bit units called segments that describe payload Type, MoS
        algorithm and MoS value. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

              is only one media stream carried in one RTP stream. The single
              stream Audio/Video per SSRC segment can be used to report the
              MoS value associated with the media stream identified by SSRC.
              If there are multiple media streams and they want to use the
              single stream Audio/Video per SSRC segment to report the MOS

              independent channel(e.g., left channel audio, right channel
              audio). This field is used to identify each channel carried in
              the same media stream. The default Channel mapping follows
              static ordering rule described in the section 4.1 of <xref
              target="RFC3551"></xref>. However there are some payload formats
              that use different channel mappings, e.g., AC-3 audio over RTP
              <xref target="RFC4184"></xref> only follow AC-3 channel order

              Audio over RTP <xref target="RFC4598"></xref> uses dynamic
              channel transform mechanism. In order that the appropriate
              channel mapping can be determined, QoE reports need to be tied
              to an RTP payload format, i.e., including the payload type of

        <t>Each local identifier (CAID)of calculation algorithm used in the
        segment defined in the section 3.2 is mapped to a string using an
        attribute of the form: <figure>
            <artwork>
a=calgextmap:&lt;value&gt; ["/"&lt;direction&gt;] &lt;name&gt; [&lt;extensionattributes&gt;]
</artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>where &lt;name&gt; is a calculation algorithm name, as above,
        &lt;value&gt; is the local identifier (CAID)of the calculation
        algorithm associated with the segment defined in this document and is
        an integer in the valid range inclusive. <figure>
            <artwork>
Example:
a=rtcp-xr:qoe-metrics=calg:1=G107,calg:2=P1202_1
</artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>A usable mapping MUST use IDs in the valid range, and each ID in
        this range MUST be unique and used only once for each stream or each
        channel in the stream.</t>

        <t>The mapping MUST be provided per media stream (in the media-level
        section(s) of SDP, i.e., after an "m=" line).</t>

        <t>The syntax element "mosref" is referred to the media resolution
        relative reference (e.g., Narrowband (3.4kHz) Speech and Standard
        Definition (SD) Resolution Video with lower resolution, Wideband
        (7kHz) Speech and High Definition (HD) Resolution Video with higher
        resolution). MOS scores reported in the QoE block might vary with the
        MoS reference; For example, MOS values for narrowband, wideband codecs
        occupy the same range but SHOULD be reported in different value. For
        video application, MoS scores for SD resolution, HD resolution video
        also occupy the same ranges and SHOULD be reported in different value.

      <section title="Offer/Answer Usage">
        <t>When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer
        usage defined in [RFC3611] applies. In the offer answer context, the
        signaling described above might be used in three ways: <vspace
        blankLines="1" /><list style="symbols">
            <t>asymmetric behavior (segment extensions sent in only one
            direction),</t>

            <t>the offer of mutually exclusive alternatives, or</t>

            <t>the offer of more segments than can be sent in a single
            session.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>A direction attribute MAY be included in a calgextmap; without it,
        the direction implicitly inherits, of course, from the RTCP stream
        direction.</t>

        <t>Segment extension, with their directions, MAY be signaled for an
        "inactive" stream. It is an error to use an extension direction
        incompatible with the stream direction (e.g., a "sendonly" attribute
        for a "recvonly" stream).</t>

        <t>If an segment extension is offered as "sendrecv", explicitly or
        implicitly, and asymmetric behavior is desired, the SDP MAY be
        modified to modify or add direction qualifiers for that segment
        extension.</t>

        <t>A mosref attribute and mos type attribute MAY be included in an
        calgextmap; without it, the mosref and most type attribute implicitly
        inherits, of course, from the name attribute (e.g., P.1201.1
        [P.1201.1] indicates lower resolution used while P.1201.2 [P.1201.2]
        indicates higher resolution used) or payload type carried in the
        segment extension (e.g.,EVRC-WB [RFC5188] indicates using Wideband
        Codec). However not all payload types or MoS algorithm names indicate
        resolution to be used and mos type to be used. </t>

        <t>If an answerer receives an offer with an mosref attribute value it
        doesn't support (e.g.,the answerer only supports "l" and receives
        "h"from offerer), the answer SHOULD reject the mosref attribute value
        offered by the offerer. </t>

        <t>If the answerer wishes to reject a mosref attribute offered by the
        offerer, it sets identifiers associated with segment extensions in the
        answer to the value in the range 4096-4351. The rejected answer MUST
        contain 'mosref ' attribute whose value is the value of the SDP
        offer.</t>

        <t>Local identifiers in the valid range inclusive in an offer or
        answer must not be used more than once per media section. A session
        update MAY change the direction qualifiers of segment extensions under
        use. A session update MAY add or remove segment extension(s).
        Identifiers values in the valid range MUST NOT be altered
        (remapped).</t>

        <t>If a party wishes to offer mutually exclusive alternatives, then
        multiple segment extensions with the same identifier in the (unusable)
        range 4096-4351 MAY be offered; the answerer SHOULD select at most one
        of the offered extensions with the same identifier, and remap it to a
        free identifier in the valid range, for that extension to be usable.
        Note that two segment types defined in section 3 are also two
        exclusive alternatives. </t>

        <t>If more segment extensions are offered in the valid range, the
        answerer SHOULD choose those that are desired, and place the offered
        identifier value "as is" in the SDP answer.</t>

        <t>Similarly, if more segment extensions are offered than can be fit
        in the valid range, identifiers in the range 4096-4351 MAY be offered;
        the answerer SHOULD choose those that are desired, and remap them to a
        free identifier in the valid range.</t>

        <t>Note that the range 4096-4351 for these negotiation identifiers is
        deliberately restricted to allow expansion of the range of valid
        identifiers in future. Segment extensions with an identifier outside
        the valid range cannot, of course, be used. <figure>

        <t>The answerer is interested in transmission P.1202.1 on lower
        resolution application, but doesn't support P.1201.1 on lower

    <section title="Example of User Quality of Experience Evaluation for video stream ">
      <t>To evaluate user quality of experience levels using objective test
      data, MoS Scores provide a familiar, easily understood numeric
      representation of video, audio, and overall audiovisual quality. Unlike
      audio, video is even more sensitive to transport impairments , and even
      low rates of packet loss can cause severe degradation in perceived
      quality. However, all occurrences of packet loss do not have an equal
      impact on perceptual quality, in part because of the way video frames
      are structured during the encoding process - such as frame properties
      including frame type, frame structure and quantization parameter (QP),
      and in part due to subjective factors - such as the degree to which
      perception is affected by the levels of motion, detail in the video
      sequence, and decoder characteristic parameters including media
      resolution,codec type. When a video stream is sent from the media source
      to RTP receiving end and get monitored. in order to provide accurate
      evaluation of video quality, one possible QoE evaluation method is
      having network nodes that implement network management tools in place.
      They may know frame properties,perception degree, decoder characteristic
      parameters of this video stream using some out of band means, gather
      transport impairment information received from the RTP receiving end and
      use them as MoS calculation input parameters to calculate MoS scores by
      choosing appropriate MoS calculation algorithm. Such MoS Scores value
      can be useful for troubleshooting or comparing video quality across
      different service types.</t>

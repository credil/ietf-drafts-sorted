    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>The IETF has worked on two signalling technologies that can be used for multimedia session negotiation, messaging, presence, capabilities discovery, notifications, and other application-level functionality:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>The Session Initiation Protocol <xref target="RFC3261"/>, along with various SIP extensions developed within the SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) Working Group.</t>
          <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol <xref target='RFC6120'/>, along with various XMPP extensions developed by the IETF as well as by the XMPP Standards Foundation.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Because these technologies are widely deployed, it is important to clearly define mappings between them for the sake of interworking.  This document inaugurates a series of SIP-XMPP interworking specifications by defining the architectural assumptions underlying such mappings as well as the mapping of addresses and error conditions.</t>
      <t>The discussion venue for this document is the mailing list of the STOX WG; visit https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/stox for subscription information and discussion archives.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="terms">
      <t>A number of terms used here are explained in <xref target='RFC3261'/> and <xref target='RFC6120'/>.</t>
      <t>Several examples use the "XML Notation" from the IRI specification <xref target='RFC3987'/> to represent Unicode characters outside the ASCII range (e.g., the string "&#x0159;" stands for the Unicode character LATIN SMALL LETTER R WITH CARON).</t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Architectural Assumptions" anchor="intro-arch">
      <t>Protocol translation between SIP and XMPP could occur in a number of different entities, depending on the architecture of real-time communication deployments.  For example, protocol translation could occur within a multi-protocol server (which uses application-specific connection managers to initiate traffic to and accept traffic from clients or other servers natively using SIP/SIMPLE, XMPP, etc.), within a multi-protocol client (which enables a user to establish connections natively with various servers using SIP/SIMPLE, XMPP, etc.), or within a gateway that acts as a dedicated protocol translator (which takes one protocol as input and provides another protocol as output).</t>
      <t>This document assumes that the protocol translation will occur within a gateway.  (This assumption is not meant to discourage protocol translation within multi-protocol clients or servers; instead, this assumption is followed mainly to clarify the discussion and examples so that the protocol translation principles can be more easily understood and can be applied by client and server implementors with appropriate modifications to the examples and terminology.)  Specifically, we assume that the protocol translation will occur within an "XMPP-to-SIP gateway" that translates XMPP syntax and semantics on behalf of an XMPP service when communicating with SIP services and/or within a "SIP-to-XMPP gateway" that translates SIP syntax and semantics on behalf of a SIP service when communicating with XMPP services (naturally, these logical functions could occur in one and the same actual translator).</t>
      <t>This document assumes that a gateway will translate directly from one protocol to the other.  For the sake of the examples, we further assume that protocol translation will occur within a gateway in the source domain, so that information generated by the user of an XMPP service will be translated by a gateway within the trust domain of that XMPP service, and information generated by the user of a SIP service will be translated by a gateway within the trust domain of that SIP service.  However, nothing in this document ought to be taken as recommending against protocol translation at the destination domain.</t>
      <t>An architectural diagram for a possible gateway deployment is shown below, where the entities have the following significance and the "#" character is used to show the boundary of a trust domain:</t>

    <section title="Interdomain Federation" anchor="fed">
      <t>The architecture assumptions underlying this document imply that communication between a SIP-based service and an XMPP-based service will take place using interdomain federation.</t>
      <t>When an XMPP service receives an XMPP stanza whose 'to' address specifies or includes a domain other than the domain of the XMPP service, it needs to determine whether the destination domain offers an XMPP service or a SIP service.  To do so, it performs one or more DNS SRV lookups <xref target="RFC2782"/> for "_xmpp-server" records as specified in <xref target="RFC6120"/>.  If the response returns a hostname, the service can attempt XMPP communication.  If not, the service can attempt to locate a SIP service for that domain using the procedures specified in <xref target='RFC3263'/>.</t>
      <t>Similarly, when a SIP service receives a SIP message whose Request-URI specifies or includes a domain other than the domain of the SIP service, it needs to determine whether the destination domain offers a SIP service or an XMPP service.  To do so, it uses the procedures specified in <xref target='RFC3263'/>.   If that response returns a hostname, the service can attempt SIP communication.  If not, the service can perform one or more DNS SRV lookups <xref target="RFC2782"/> for "_xmpp-server" records as specified in <xref target="RFC6120"/>.</t>
      <t>In both cases, the service in question might have previously determined that the foreign domain is a SIP service or an XMPP service, in which case it would not need to perform the relevant DNS lookups.  The caching of such information is a matter of implementation and local service policy, and is therefore out of scope for this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Address Mapping" anchor="addr">
      <section title="Overview" anchor="addr-over">
        <t>The basic SIP address format is a 'sip' or 'sips' URI as specified in <xref target='RFC3261'/>.  When a SIP entity supports extensions for instant messaging it might be identified by an 'im' URI as specified in the Common Profile for Instant Messaging <xref target="RFC3860"/> (see <xref target="RFC3428"/>) and when a SIP entity spports extensions for presence it might be identified by a 'pres' URI as specified in the Common Profile for Presence <xref target="RFC3859"/> (see <xref target="RFC3856"/>).  SIP entities typically also support the 'tel' URI scheme <xref target='RFC3966'/> and might support other URI schemes as well.</t>
        <t>The XMPP address format is specified in <xref target="RFC6122"/> (although note that XMPP URIs <xref target='RFC5122'/> are not used natively on the XMPP network); in addition, <xref target="RFC6121"/> encourages instant messaging and presence applications of XMPP to also support 'im' and 'pres' URIs as specified in <xref target="RFC3860"/> and <xref target="RFC3859"/> respectively, although such support might simply involve leaving resolution of such addresses up to an XMPP server.</t>
        <t>In this document we primarily describe mappings for addresses of the form &lt;user@domain&gt;; however, we also provide guidelines for mapping the addresses of specific user agent instances, which take the form of Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in SIP and "resourceparts" in XMPP.  Mapping of protocol-specific identifiers (such as telephone numbers) is out of scope for this specification.  In addition, we have ruled the mapping of domain names as out of scope for now since that is a matter for the Domain Name System; specifically, the issue for interworking between SIP and XMPP relates to the translation of fully internationalized domain names (IDNs) into non-internationalized domain names (IDNs are not allowed in the SIP address format, but are allowed in the XMPP address via Internationalized Domain Names in Applications, see <xref target="RFC6122"/> and <xref target='I-D.ietf-xmpp-6122bis'/>).  Therefore, in the following sections we focus primarily on the local part of an address (these are called variously "usernames", "instant inboxes", "presentities", and "localparts" in the protocols at issue), secondarily on the instance-specific part of an address, and not at all on the domain-name part of an address.</t>
        <t>The sip:/sips:, im:/pres:, and XMPP address schemes allow different sets of characters (although all three allow alphanumeric characters and disallow both spaces and control characters).  In some cases, characters allowed in one scheme are disallowed in others; these characters need to be mapped appropriately in order to ensure interworking across systems.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Local Part Mapping" anchor="addr-localpart">
        <t>The local part of a sip:/sips: URI inherits from the "userinfo" rule in <xref target="RFC3986"/> with several changes; here we discuss the SIP "user" rule only:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
   user             =  1*( unreserved / escaped / user-unreserved )
   user-unreserved  =  "&" / "=" / "+" / "$" / "," / ";" / "?" / "/"
   unreserved       =  alphanum / mark
   mark             =  "-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" / "'"
                       / "(" / ")"
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>Here we make the simplifying assumption that the local part of an im:/pres: URI inherits from the "dot-atom-text" rule in <xref target="RFC5322"/> rather than the more complicated "local-part" rule:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
   dot-atom-text =  1*atext *("." 1*atext)
   atext         =  ALPHA / DIGIT /    ; Any character except 
                    "!" / "#" / "$" /  ; controls, SP, and 
                    "%" / "&" / "'" /  ; specials. Used for 
                    "*" / "+" / "-" /  ; atoms.
                    "/" / "=" / "?" /
                    "^" / "_" / "`" / 
                    "{" / "|" / "}" /
                    "~"
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>The local part of an XMPP address allows any ASCII character except space, controls, and the " &amp; ' / : &lt; &gt; @ characters.</t>
        <t>To summarize the foregoing information, the following table lists the allowed and disallowed characters in the local part of identifiers for each protocol (aside from the alphanumeric, space, and control characters), in order by hexadecimal character number (where each "A" row shows the allowed characters and each "D" row shows the disallowed characters).</t>

        <t>When transforming the local part of an address from one scheme to another, an application SHOULD proceed as follows:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>Unescape any escaped characters in the source address (e.g., from SIP to XMPP unescape "%23" to "#" per <xref target='RFC3986'/> and from XMPP to SIP unescape "\27" to "'" per <xref target='XEP-0106'/>).</t>
            <t>Leave unmodified any characters that are allowed in the destination scheme.</t>
            <t>Escape any characters that are allowed in the source scheme but reserved in the destination scheme, as escaping is defined for the destination scheme.  In particular:
              <list style='symbols'>
                <t>Where the destination scheme is a URI (i.e., an im:, pres:, sip:, or sips: URI), each reserved character MUST be percent-encoded to "%hexhex" as specified in Section 2.5 of <xref target='RFC3986'/> (e.g., when transforming from XMPP to SIP, encode "#" as "%23").</t>
                <t>Where the destination scheme is a native XMPP address, each reserved character MUST be encoded to "\hexhex" as specified in <xref target='XEP-0106'/> (e.g., when transforming from SIP to XMPP, encode "'" as "\27").</t>

      <section title="Instance-Specific Mapping" anchor="addr-instance">
        <t>The meaning of a resourcepart in XMPP (i.e., the portion of a JID after the slash character, such as "foo" in "user@example.com/foo") matches that of a Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) in SIP <xref target='RFC5627'/>.  In both cases, these constructs identify a particular device associated with the bare JID ("localpart@domainpart") of an XMPP entity or with the Address of Record (AOR) of a SIP entity. Therefore, it is reasonable to map the value of a "gr" URI parameter to an XMPP resourcepart, and vice-versa.</t>
        <t>The mapping described here does not apply to temporary GRUUs, only to GRUUs associated with an Address of Record.</t>
        <t>The "gr" URI parameter in SIP can contain only characters from the ASCII range (although characters outside the ASCII range can be percent-encoded in accordance with <xref target='RFC3986'/>, whereas an XMPP resourcepart can contain nearly any Unicode character <xref target='UNICODE'/>.  Therefore Unicode characters outside the ASCII range need to be mapped to characters in the ASCII range, as described below.</t>

            <t>Apply Nodeprep profile of Stringprep <xref target="RFC3454"/> or its replacement (see <xref target="RFC6122"/> and <xref target='I-D.ietf-xmpp-6122bis'/>) for canonicalization (OPTIONAL).</t>

    <section title='Error Mapping' anchor="errors">

      <t>Various differences between XMPP error conditions and SIP response codes make it hard to provide a comprehensive and consistent mapping between the protocols:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Whereas the set of XMPP error conditions is fixed in the core XMPP specification (and supplemented where needed by application-specific extensions), the set of SIP response codes is more open to change, as evidenced by the IANA registry of SIP response codes.</t>
          <t>XMPP has defined fewer error conditions related to stanza handling (22 are defined in <xref target='RFC6120'/>) than SIP has defined response codes related to message handling (at the date of this writing, 71 SIP response codes are registered with IANA as defined in <xref target='RFC3261'/> and numerous SIP extensions).</t>
          <t>In many cases, the SIP response codes are more specific than the XMPP error conditions (e.g., from an XMPP perspective the SIP codes "413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI Too Long" are just two forms of a bad request, and the SIP codes "415 Unsupported Media Type" and "416 Unsupported URI Scheme" are just two forms of a request that is not acceptable).</t>
          <t>SIP differentiates between responses about a particular endpoint or resource (the 4xx series) and responses about a user, i.e., all of a user's endpoints or resources (the 6xx series).  There is no such distinction in XMPP, since the same error condition can be returned in relation to the "bare JID" (localpart@domainpart) of a user or the "full JID" (localpart@domainpart/resourcepart) of a particular endpoint or resource, depending on the 'to' address of the original request.</t>

      <t>As a result of these and other factors, the mapping of error conditions and response codes is more of an art than a science.  This document provides suggested mappings, but implementations are free to deviate from these mappings if needed.  Also, because no XMPP error conditions are equivalent to the provisional (1xx) and successful (2xx) response codes in SIP, this document suggests mappings only for the SIP redirection (3xx), request failure (4xx), server failure (5xx), and global failure (6xx) response code families.</t>
      <t>Supplementary information about SIP response codes can be expressed in the "Reason-Phrase" in the Status-Line header, and detailed information about XMPP error conditions can be expressed in the &lt;text/&gt; child of the &lt;error/&gt; element.  Although the semantics of these constructs are specified in a slightly different way, it is reasonable for a gateway to map these constructs to each other if they are found in a SIP response or XMPP error stanza.</t>

            <t>If the error relates to a "full JID" (localpart@domainpart/resourcepart), the SIP 405 response code is RECOMMENDED.  If the error relates to a "bare JID" (localpart@domainpart), the SIP 501 response code is RECOMMENDED.</t>

            <t>The XMPP &lt;remote-server-not-found/&gt; error can mean either that the remote server (a) does not exist or (b) cannot be resolved.  SIP has two different response codes here, 404 to cover (a) and 408 to cover (b).</t>
            <t>The XMPP &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error condition is widely used to inform the requesting entity that the intended recipient does not support the relevant feature, to signal that a server cannot perform the requested service either generally or in relation to a particular user, and to avoid disclosing whether a given account exists at all.  This is quite different from the semantics of the SIP 503 Service Unavailable response code, which is used to signal that communication with a server is impossible (e.g., even if the XMPP &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error condition is returned in relation to a specific user, the SIP 503 response code will be interpreted as applying to the entire domain, not only the specific user).  Therefore, mapping the XMPP &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error condition to the SIP 503 Service Unavailable response code is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Although no precise mapping is available, the SIP 403 Forbidden and 405 Method Not Allowed response codes are closest in meaning to the XMPP &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error condition.</t>

      <t>A gateway between SIP and XMPP (in either direction) effectively acts as a SIP back-to-back user agent ("B2BUA").  The amplification vulnerability described in <xref target='RFC5393'/> can manifest itself with B2BUAs (see also <xref target='I-D.ietf-straw-b2bua-loop-detection'/>), and a gateway SHOULD implement the loop-detection methods defined in that specification to help mitigate the possibility of amplification attacks.  Note that, although it would be possible to signal the Max-Forwards and Max-Breadth SIP headers over XMPP using the Stanza Headers and Internet Metadata (SHIM) extension <xref target='XEP-0131'/>, that extension is not widely implemented; therefore, defenses against excessive looping and amplification attacks when messages pass back and forth through SIP and XMPP networks is out of scope for this document.  However, it ought to be addressed in the future, and implementations are strongly encouraged to incorporate appropriate counter measures wherever possible.</t>

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<t>This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs, where appropriate, to identify resources.&lt;/t>&lt;t> The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs. This was done in order to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components that currently deal with URIs.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP proxy behavior.

<abstract>
<t>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI that can be used by anyone on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA instance.  A URI that routes to a specific UA instance is called a Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU).  This document describes an extension to SIP for obtaining a GRUU from a registrar and for communicating a GRUU to a peer within a dialog. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate TCP connections or to send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in order to deliver requests.  However, in a large number of real deployments, many practical considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs) or the use of TLS with server-provided certificates, prevent servers from connecting to User Agents in this way.  This specification defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars, and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent.  It also defines keep-alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections from the User Agent to its registrar. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

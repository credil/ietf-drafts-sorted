      <t>Application protocols using Unicode code points in protocol strings need to properly prepare such strings in order to perform valid comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or authorization).  This document defines a framework enabling application protocols to perform the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings (a.k.a. "PRECIS") in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode code points and thus is agile with respect to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework provides a more sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  This document obsoletes RFC 3454.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor='intro'>
      <t>As described in the problem statement for the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("PRECIS") <xref target='RFC6885'/>, many IETF protocols have used the Stringprep framework <xref target='RFC3454'/> as the basis for preparing and comparing protocol strings that contain Unicode code points <xref target='UNICODE'/> outside the ASCII range <xref target='RFC20'/>.  The Stringprep framework was developed during work on the original technology for internationalized domain names (IDNs), here called "IDNA2003" <xref target='RFC3490'/>, and Nameprep <xref target="RFC3491"/> was the Stringprep profile for IDNs.  At the time, Stringprep was designed as a general framework so that other application protocols could define their own Stringprep profiles for the preparation and comparison of strings and identifiers.  Indeed, a number of application protocols defined such profiles.</t>
      <t>After the publication of <xref target='RFC3454'/> in 2002, several significant issues arose with the use of Stringprep in the IDN case, as documented in the IAB's recommendations regarding IDNs <xref target='RFC4690'/> (most significantly, Stringprep was tied to Unicode version 3.2).  Therefore, the newer IDNA specifications, here called "IDNA2008" (<xref target='RFC5890'/>, <xref target='RFC5891'/>, <xref target='RFC5892'/>, <xref target='RFC5893'/>, <xref target='RFC5894'/>), no longer use Stringprep and Nameprep.  This migration away from Stringprep for IDNs has prompted other "customers" of Stringprep to consider new approaches to the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings (a.k.a. "PRECIS"), as described in <xref target='RFC6885'/>.</t>
      <t>This document defines a framework for a post-Stringprep approach to the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings in application protocols, based on several principles:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Define a small set of string classes that specify the code points appropriate for common application protocol constructs.</t>
          <t>Define each PRECIS string class in terms of Unicode code points and their properties so that an algorithm can be used to determine whether each code point or character category is valid, contextual rule required, disallowed, or unassigned.</t>
          <t>Define string classes in terms of allowable code points, so that any code point not explicitly allowed is forbidden.</t>
          <t>Enable application protocols to define profiles of the PRECIS string classes, addressing matters such as width mapping, case folding and other forms of character mapping, Unicode normalization, directionality, and further excluded code points or character categories.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Whereas the string classes define the "baseline" code points for a range of applications, profiling enables application protocols to further restrict the allowable code points beyond those specified for the relevant string class (e.g., characters with special or reserved meaning, such as "@" and "/" when used as separators within identifiers) and to apply the string classes in ways that are appropriate for constructs such as usernames and passwords <xref target='I-D.ietf-precis-saslprepbis'/>, nicknames <xref target='I-D.ietf-precis-nickname'/>, the localparts of instant messaging addresses <xref target='I-D.ietf-xmpp-6122bis'/>, and free-form strings <xref target='I-D.ietf-xmpp-6122bis'/>.  Profiles are responsible for defining the handling of right-to-left characters as well as various mapping operations of the kind also discussed for IDNs in <xref target='RFC5895'/>, such as case preservation or lowercasing, Unicode normalization, mapping of certain characters to other characters or to nothing, and mapping of full-width and half-width characters.</t>
      <t>It is expected that this framework will yield the following benefits:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Application protocols will be more version-agile with regard to the Unicode database.</t>
          <t>Implementers will be able to share code point tables and software code across application protocols, most likely by means of software libraries.</t>
          <t>End users will be able to acquire more accurate expectations about the code points that are acceptable in various contexts.  Given this more uniform set of string classes, it is also expected that copy/paste operations between software implementing different application protocols will be more predictable and coherent.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Although this framework is similar to IDNA2008 and borrows some of the character categories defined in <xref target='RFC5892'/>, it defines additional character categories to meet the needs of common application protocols.</t>
      <t>The character categories and calculation rules defined under <xref target="categories" /> and <xref target="PropertyCalculation" /> are normative and apply to all Unicode code points.  The list of code points provided under <xref target="codepoints" /> are non-normative and merely show, for illustrative purposes, the consequences of the character categories and calculation rules, and the resulting property values.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="terms">
      <t>Many important terms used in this document are defined in <xref target='RFC5890'/>, <xref target='RFC6365'/>, <xref target='RFC6885'/>, and <xref target='UNICODE'/>.  The terms "left-to-right" (LTR) and "right-to-left" (RTL) are defined in <xref target='UAX9'/>.</t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="String Classes" anchor='classes'>

      <section title="Overview" anchor='classes-overview'>
        <t>IDNA2008 essentially defines a string class of internationalized domain name (IDN), although it does not use the term "string class".  (This document does not define a string class for domain names, and application protocols are strongly encouraged to use IDNA2008 as the appropriate method to prepare domain names and hostnames.)  Because the IDN string class is designed to meet the particular requirements of the Domain Name System (DNS), additional string classes are needed for non-DNS applications.</t>
        <t>Starting in 2010, various "customers" of Stringprep began to discuss the need to define a post-Stringprep approach to the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings other than IDNs.  This community analyzed the existing Stringprep profiles and also weighed the costs and benefits of defining a relatively small set of Unicode characters that would minimize the potential for user confusion caused by visually similar characters (and thus be relatively "safe") vs. defining a much larger set of Unicode characters that would maximize the potential for user expressiveness (and thus be relatively inclusive).  As a result, the community concluded that most existing uses could be addressed by two string classes:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='hanging'>
            <t hangText="IdentifierClass:">a sequence of letters, numbers, and some symbols that is used to identify or address a network entity such as a user account, a venue (e.g., a chatroom), an information source (e.g., a data feed), or a collection of data (e.g., a file); the intent is that this class will be very safe for use in a wide variety of application protocols, with the result that safety has been prioritized over inclusiveness for this class.</t>
            <t hangText="FreeformClass:">a sequence of letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, and other code points that is used for free-form strings, including passwords as well as display elements such as human-friendly nicknames in chatrooms; the intent is that this class will allow nearly any Unicode character, with the result that inclusiveness has been prioritized over safety for this class (e.g., protocol designers, application developers, service providers, and end users might not understand or be able to enter all of the characters that can be included in the FreeformClass).</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Future specifications might define additional PRECIS string classes, such as a class that falls somewhere between the IdentifierClass and the FreeformClass.  At this time, it is not clear how useful such a class would be.  In any case, because application developers are able to define profiles of PRECIS string classes, a protocol needing a construct between the IdentiferClass and the FreeformClass could of course define a restricted profile of the FreeformClass if needed.</t> 
        <t>The following subsections discuss the IdentifierClass and FreeformClass in more detail, with reference to the dimensions described in Section 3 of <xref target='RFC6885'/>.  (Naturally, future documents can define PRECIS string classes beyond the IdentifierClass and FreeformClass; see <xref target='iana-classes'/>.)  Each string class is defined by the following behavioral rules:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='hanging'>
            <t hangText='Valid:'>Defines which code points and character categories are treated as valid input to the string.</t>
            <t hangText='Contextual Rule Required:'>Defines which code points and character categories are treated as requiring a contextual rule (i.e., either CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO).</t>
            <t hangText='Disallowed:'>Defines which code points and character categories need to be excluded from the string.</t>
            <t hangText='Unassigned:'>Defines application behavior in the presence of code points that are unassigned, i.e. unknown for the version of Unicode the application is built upon.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>This document defines the valid, contextual rule required, disallowed, and unassigned rules for the IdentifierClass and FreeformClass.  As described under <xref target='profiles'/>, profiles of these string classes are responsible for defining the width mapping, additional mapping, case mapping, normalization, directionality, and exclusion rules.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IdentifierClass" anchor="classes-id">
        <t>Most application technologies need strings that can be used to refer to, include, or communicate protocol strings like usernames, file names, data feed identifiers, and chatroom names.  We group such strings into a class called "IdentifierClass" having the following features.</t>
        <section title='Valid' anchor='classes-id-valid'>
          <t>
            <list style='symbols'>
              <t>Code points traditionally used as letters and numbers in writing systems, i.e., the LetterDigits ("A") category first defined in <xref target='RFC5892'/> and listed here under <xref target='A'/>.</t>
              <t>Code points in the range U+0021 through U+007E, i.e., the (printable) ASCII7 ("K") rule defined under <xref target='K'/>.  These code points are "grandfathered" into PRECIS and thus are valid even if they would otherwise be disallowed according to the property-based rules specified in the next section.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>Although the PRECIS IdentifierClass re-uses the LetterDigits category from IDNA2008, the range of characters allowed in the IdentifierClass is wider than the range of characters allowed in IDNA2008.  The main reason is that IDNA2008 applies the Unstable category before the LetterDigits category, thus disallowing uppercase characters, whereas the IdentifierClass does not apply the Unstable category.</t>

              <t>Any character that has a compatibility equivalent, i.e., the HasCompat ("Q") category defined under <xref target='Q'/>.  These code points are disallowed even if they would otherwise be valid according to the property-based rules specified in the previous section.</t>
              <t>Letters and digits other than the "traditional" letters and digits allowed in IDNs, i.e., the OtherLetterDigits ("R") category defined under <xref target='R'/>.</t>

We group such things into a class called "FreeformClass" having the following features.</t>

    <section title="Profiles" anchor="profiles">

      <section title="Principles" anchor="profiles-principles">
        <t>This framework document defines the valid, contextual-rule-required, disallowed, and unassigned rules for the IdentifierClass and the FreeformClass.  A profile of a PRECIS string class MUST define the width mapping, additional mapping (if any), case mapping, normalization, directionality, and exclusion rules.  A profile MAY also restrict the allowable characters above and beyond the definition of the relevant PRECIS string class (but MUST NOT add as valid any code points or character categories that are disallowed by the relevant PRECIS string class).  These matters are discussed in the following subsections.</t>
        <t>Profiles of the PRECIS string classes MUST register with the IANA as described under <xref target='iana-profiles'/>.  It is RECOMMENDED for profile names to be of the form "ProfilenameBaseClass", where the "Profilename" string is a differentiator and "BaseClass" is the name of the PRECIS string class being profiled; for example, the profile of the IdentifierClass used for localparts of Jabber IDs in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is named "JIDlocalIdentifierClass" <xref target='I-D.ietf-xmpp-6122bis'/>.</t>

        <section title="Width Mapping" anchor="profiles-principles-width">
          <t>The width mapping rule of a profile specifies whether width mapping is performed on fullwidth and halfwidth characters, and how the mapping is done (e.g., mapping fullwidth and halfwidth characters to their decomposition equivalents).</t>
          <t>The normalization form specified by a profile (see below) has an impact on the need for width mapping.  Because one aspect of Unicode normalization form KC (NFKC) is width mapping, a profile that uses NFKC does not need to specify width mapping.  However, if Unicode normalization form C (NFC) is used then the profile needs to specify whether to apply width mapping; in this case, width mapping is in general RECOMMENDED because allowing fullwidth and halfwidth characters to remain unmapped to their decomposition equivalents would violate the principle of least user surprise.  For more information about the concept of width in East Asian scripts within Unicode, see for instance <xref target='UAX11'/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Additional Mappings" anchor="profiles-principles-additional">
          <t>The additional mappings rule of a profile specifies whether additional mappings are to be applied, such as mapping of delimiter characters, mapping of special characters (e.g., non-ASCII space characters to ASCII space or certain characters to nothing), and case mapping based on language and local context (see <xref target='I-D.ietf-precis-mappings'/>).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Case Mapping" anchor="profiles-principles-case">
          <t>The case mapping rule of a profile specifies whether case mapping is performed (instead of case preservation) on uppercase and titlecase characters, and how the mapping is done (e.g., mapping uppercase and titlecase characters to their lowercase equivalents).</t>
          <t>Use of the Unicode Default Case Folding algorithm is RECOMMENDED.</t>
          <t>In order to maximize entropy and minimize the potential for false positives, it is NOT RECOMMENDED for application protocols to map uppercase and titlecase code points to their lowercase equivalents when strings conforming to the FreeformClass, or a profile thereof, are used in passwords; instead, it is RECOMMENDED to preserve the case of all code points contained in such strings and then perform case-sensitive comparison.  See also the related discussion in <xref target='I-D.ietf-precis-saslprepbis'/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Normalization" anchor="profiles-principles-normalization">
          <t>The normalization rule of a profile specifies which Unicode normalization form (D, KD, C, or KC) is to be applied (see <xref target='UAX15'/> for background information).</t>
          <t>In accordance with <xref target='RFC5198'/>, normalization form C (NFC) is RECOMMENDED.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Directionality" anchor="profiles-principles-directionality">
          <t>The directionality rule of a profile specifies which strings are to be considered left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL), and the allowable sequences of characters in LTR and RTL strings (see <xref target='UAX9'/>); note that mixed-direction strings are not supported, since there is currently no widely accepted and implemented solution for the processing and display of mixed-direction strings.  Possible rules include, but are not limited to, (a) considering any string that contains a right-to-left code point to be a right-to-left string, or (b) applying the "Bidi Rule" from <xref target='RFC5893'/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Exclusions" anchor="profiles-principles-exclusions">
          <t>The exclusions rule of a profile specifies whether the profile excludes additional code points or character categories above and beyond those excluded by the string class being profiled.  That is, a profile MAY do either of the following:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>Exclude specific code points that are allowed by the relevant string class.</t>
            <t>Exclude characters matching certain Unicode properties (e.g., math symbols) that are included in the relevant PRECIS string class.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>As a result of such exclusions, code points that are defined as valid for the PRECIS string class being profiled will be defined as disallowed for the profile.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Building Application-Layer Constructs" anchor="use-build">
        <t>Sometimes, an application-layer construct does not map in a straightforward manner to one of the PRECIS string classes or a profile thereof.  Consider, for example, the "simple user name" construct in the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) <xref target='RFC4422'/>.  Depending on the deployment, a simple user name might take the form of a user's full name (e.g., the user's personal name followed by a space and then the user's family name).  Such a simple user name cannot be defined as an instance of the IdentifierClass or a profile thereof, since space characters are not allowed in the IdentifierClass; however, it could be defined using a space-separated sequence of IdentifierClass instances, as in the following pseudo-ABNF <xref target='RFC5234'/>:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
   fullname = namepart [1*(1*SP namepart)]
   namepart = 1*(idpoint)
              ;
              ; an "idpoint" is a UTF-8 encoded Unicode code point
              ; that conforms to the PRECIS IdentifierClass
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>Similar techniques could be used to define many application-layer constructs, say of the form "user@domain" or "/path/to/file".</t>
      </section>

      <section title="A Note about Spaces" anchor="use-space">
        <t>With regard to the IdentiferClass, the consensus of the PRECIS Working Group was that spaces are problematic for many reasons, including:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>Many Unicode characters are confusable with ASCII space.</t>
            <t>Even if non-ASCII space characters are mapped to ASCII space (U+0020), space characters are often not rendered in user interfaces, leading to the possibility that human user might consider a string containing spaces to be equivalent to the same string without spaces.</t>
            <t>In some locales, some devices are known to generate a character other than ASCII space (such as ZERO WIDTH JOINER, U+200D) when a user performs an action like hit the space bar on a keyboard.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>One consequence of disallowing space characters in the IdentifierClass might be to effectively discourage the use of ASCII space (or, even more problematically, non-ASCII space characters) within identifiers created in newer application protocols; given the challenges involved in properly handling space characters in identifiers and other protocol strings, the Working Group considered this to be a feature, not a bug.</t>
        <t>However, the FreeformClass does allow spaces, which enables application protocols to define profiles of the FreeformClass that are more flexible than any profiles of the IdentifierClass.</t>

    <section title="Code Point Properties">
      <t>In order to implement the string classes described above, this document does the following:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Reviews and classifies the collections of code points in the Unicode character set by examining various code point properties.</t>
          <t>Defines an algorithm for determining a derived property value, which can vary depending on the string class being used by the relevant application protocol.</t>
         </list>
       </t>
      <t>This document is not intended to specify precisely how derived property values are to be applied in protocol strings.  That information is the responsibility of the protocol specification that uses or profiles a PRECIS string class from this document.</t>
      <t>The value of the property is to be interpreted as follows.</t> 
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText='PROTOCOL VALID'>Those code points that are allowed to be used in any PRECIS string class (IdentifierClass and FreeformClass).  Code points with this property value are permitted for general use in any string class.  The abbreviated term PVALID is used to refer to this value in the remainder of this document.</t>
          <t hangText='SPECIFIC CLASS PROTOCOL VALID'>Those code points that are allowed to be used in specific string classes. Code points with this property value are permitted for use in specific string classes.  In the remainder of this document, the abbreviated term *_PVAL is used, where * = (ID | FREE), i.e., either FREE_PVAL or ID_PVAL.</t>
          <t hangText='CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED'>Some characteristics of the character, such as its being invisible in certain contexts or problematic in others, require that it not be used in labels unless specific other characters or properties are present.  The abbreviated term CONTEXT is used to refer to this value in the remainder of this document.  As in IDNA2008, there are two subdivisions of CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED, the first for Join_controls (called CONTEXTJ) and the second for other characters (called CONTEXTO).  A character with the derived property value CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO (CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED) MUST NOT be used unless an appropriate rule has been established and the context of the character is consistent with that rule.</t>
          <t hangText='DISALLOWED'>Those code points that must not permitted in any PRECIS string class.</t>
          <t hangText='SPECIFIC CLASS DISALLOWED'>Those code points that are not to be included in a specific string class.  Code points with this property value are not permitted in one of the string classes but might be permitted in others.  In the remainder of this document, the abbreviated term *_DIS is used, where * = (ID | FREE), i.e., either FREE_DIS or ID_DIS.</t>
          <t hangText='UNASSIGNED'>Those code points that are not designated (i.e. are unassigned) in the Unicode Standard.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The mechanisms described here allow determination of the value of the property for future versions of Unicode (including characters added after Unicode 5.2 or 6.2 depending on the category, since some categories in this document are reused from IDNA2008 and therefore were defined at the time of Unicode 5.2).  Changes in Unicode properties that do not affect the outcome of this process do not affect this framework.  For example, a character can have its Unicode General_Category value <xref target='UNICODE'/> change from So to Sm, or from Lo to Ll, without affecting the algorithm results.  Moreover, even if such changes were to result, the <xref target="G">BackwardCompatible list</xref> can be adjusted to ensure the stability of the results.</t>
      <t>Some code points need to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, but ought to be excluded in all other cases; these rules are also described in other documents.  The most notable of these are the Join Control characters, U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER.  Both of them have the derived property value CONTEXTJ.  A character with the derived property value CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO (CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED) is not to be used unless an appropriate rule has been established and the context of the character is consistent with that rule.  It is invalid to generate a string containing these characters unless such a contextual rule is found and satisfied.  PRECIS does not define its own contextual rules, but instead re-uses the contextual rules defined for IDNA2008; please see Appendix A of <xref target='RFC5892'/> for more information.</t>

    <section anchor="categories" title="Category Definitions Used to Calculate Derived Property">
      <t>The derived property obtains its value based on a two-step procedure:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Characters are placed in one or more character categories either (1) based on core properties defined by the Unicode Standard or (2) by treating the code point as an exception and addressing the code point based on its code point value.  These categories are not mutually exclusive.</t>
          <t>Set operations are used with these categories to determine the values for a property that is specific to a given string class. These operations are specified under <xref target="PropertyCalculation" />.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>(Note: Unicode property names and property value names might have short abbreviations, such as "gc" for the General_Category property and "Ll" for the Lowercase_Letter property value of the gc property.)</t>
      <t>In the following specification of character categories, the operation that returns the value of a particular Unicode character property for a code point is designated by using the formal name of that property (from the Unicode <eref target="http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/PropertyAliases.txt">PropertyAliases.txt</eref>) followed by '(cp)' for "code point".  For example, the value of the General_Category property for a code point is indicated by General_Category(cp).</t>
      <t>The first ten categories (A-J) shown below were previously defined for IDNA2008 and are copied directly from <xref target='RFC5892'/>.  Some of these categories are reused in PRECIS and some of them are not; however, the lettering of categories is retained to prevent overlap and to ease implementation of both IDNA2008 and PRECIS in a single software application.  The next eight categories (K-R) are specific to PRECIS.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor='security'>
      <section title="General Issues" anchor='security-gen'>
        <t>The security of applications that use this framework can depend in part on the proper preparation and comparison of internationalized strings.  For example, such strings can be used to make authentication and authorization decisions, and the security of an application could be compromised if an entity providing a given string is connected to the wrong account or online resource based on different interpretations of the string.</t>
        <t>Specifications of application protocols that use this framework are encouraged to describe how internationalized strings are used in the protocol, including the security implications of any false positives and false negatives that might result from various comparison operations.  For some helpful guidelines, refer to <xref target='RFC6943'/>, <xref target='RFC5890'/>, <xref target='UTR36'/>, and <xref target='UTS39'/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Use of the IdentifierClass" anchor='security-nameclass'>
        <t>Strings that conform to the IdentifierClass and any profile thereof are intended to be relatively safe for use in a broad range of applications, primarily because they include only letters, digits, and "grandfathered" non-space characters from the ASCII range; thus they exclude spaces, characters with compatibility equivalents, and almost all symbols and punctuation marks.  However, because such strings can still include so-called confusable characters (see <xref target='security-confusables'/>, protocol designers and implementers are encouraged to pay close attention to the security considerations described elsewhere in this document.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Use of the FreeformClass" anchor='security-freeclass'>
        <t>Strings that conform to the FreeformClass and many profiles thereof can include virtually any Unicode character.  This makes the FreeformClass quite expressive, but also problematic from the perspective of possible user confusion.  Protocol designers are hereby warned that the FreeformClass contains codepoints they might not understand, and are encouraged to profile the IdentifierClass wherever feasible; however, if an application protocol requires more code points than are allowed by the IdentifierClass, protocol designers are encouraged to define a profile of the FreeformClass that restricts the allowable code points as tightly as possible.  (The working group considered the option of allowing superclasses as well as profiles of PRECIS string classes, but decided against allowing superclasses to reduce the likelihood of security and interoperability problems.)</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Local Character Set Issues" anchor='security-charset'>
        <t>When systems use local character sets other than ASCII and Unicode, these specifications leave the problem of converting between the local character set and Unicode up to the application or local system.  If different applications (or different versions of one application) implement different rules for conversions among coded character sets, they could interpret the same name differently and contact different application servers or other network entities.  This problem is not solved by security protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target='RFC5246'/> and the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) <xref target='RFC4422'/>, that do not take local character sets into account.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Visually Similar Characters" anchor='security-confusables'>
        <t>Some characters are visually similar and thus can cause confusion among humans.  Such characters are often called "confusable characters" or "confusables".</t>
        <t>The problem of confusable characters is not necessarily caused by the use of Unicode code points outside the ASCII range.  For example, in some presentations and to some individuals the string "ju1iet" (spelled with the Arabic numeral one as the third character) might appear to be the same as "juliet" (spelled with the lowercase version of the letter "L"), especially on casual visual inspection.  This phenomenon is sometimes called "typejacking".</t>
        <t>However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full range of Unicode code points into protocol strings.  For example, the characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2 from the Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might look when presented using a "creative" font family.</t>
        <t>In some examples of confusable characters, it is unlikely that the average human could tell the difference between the real string and the fake string.  (Indeed, there is no programmatic way to distinguish with full certainty which is the fake string and which is the real string; in some contexts, the string formed of Cherokee characters might be the real string and the string formed of ASCII characters might be the fake string.)  Because PRECIS-compliant strings can contain almost any properly-encoded Unicode code point, it can be relatively easy to fake or mimic some strings in systems that use the PRECIS framework.  The fact that some strings are easily confused introduces security vulnerabilities of the kind that have also plagued the World Wide Web, specifically the phenomenon known as phishing.</t>
        <t>Despite the fact that some specific suggestions about identification and handling of confusable characters appear in the Unicode Security Considerations <xref target='UTR36'/> and the Unicode Security Mechanisms <xref target='UTS39'/>, it is also true (as noted in <xref target='RFC5890'/>) that "there are no comprehensive technical solutions to the problems of confusable characters".  Because it is impossible to map visually similar characters without a great deal of context (such as knowing the font families used), the PRECIS framework does nothing to map similar-looking characters together, nor does it prohibit some characters because they look like others.</t>
        <t>Nevertheless, specifications for application protocols that use this framework MUST describe how confusable characters can be used to compromise the security of systems that use the protocol in question, along with any protocol-specific suggestions for overcoming those threats.  In particular, software implementations and service deployments that use PRECIS-based technologies are strongly encouraged to define and implement consistent policies regarding the registration, storage, and presentation of visually similar characters.  The following recommendations are appropriate:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>An application service SHOULD define a policy that specifies the scripts or blocks of characters that the service will allow to be registered (e.g., in an account name) or stored (e.g., in a file name).  Such a policy SHOULD be informed by the languages and scripts that are used to write registered account names; in particular, to reduce confusion, the service SHOULD forbid registration or storage of strings that contain characters from more than one script and SHOULD restrict registrations to characters drawn from a very small number of scripts (e.g., scripts that are well-understood by the administrators of the service, to improve manageability).</t>
            <t>User-oriented application software SHOULD define a policy that specifies how internationalized strings will be presented to a human user.  Because every human user of such software has a preferred language or a small set of preferred languages, the software SHOULD gather that information either explicitly from the user or implicitly via the operating system of the user's device.  Furthermore, because most languages are typically represented by a single script or a small set of scripts, and because most scripts are typically contained in one or more blocks of characters, the software SHOULD warn the user when presenting a string that mixes characters from more than one script or block, or that uses characters outside the normal range of the user's preferred language(s).  (Such a recommendation is not intended to discourage communication across different communities of language users; instead, it recognizes the existence of such communities and encourages due caution when presenting unfamiliar scripts or characters to human users.)</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>The challenges inherent in supporting the full range of Unicode code points have in the past led some to hope for a way to programmatically negotiate more restrictive ranges based on locale, script, or other relevant factors, to tag the locale associated with a particular string, etc.  As a general-purpose internationalization technology, the PRECIS framework does not include such mechanisms.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Security of Passwords" anchor='security-passwords'>
        <t>Two goals of passwords are to maximize the amount of entropy and to minimize the potential for false positives.  These goals can be achieved in part by allowing a wide range of code points and by ensuring that passwords are handled in such a way that code points are not compared aggressively.  Therefore, it is NOT RECOMMENDED for application protocols to profile the FreeformClass for use in passwords in a way that removes entire categories (e.g., by disallowing symbols or punctuation).  Furthermore, it is NOT RECOMMENDED for application protocols to map uppercase and titlecase code points to their lowercase equivalents in such strings; instead, it is RECOMMENDED to preserve the case of all code points contained in such strings and to compare them in a case-sensitive manner.</t>
        <t>That said, software implementers need to be aware that there exist tradeoffs between entropy and usability.  For example, allowing a user to establish a password containing "uncommon" code points might make it difficult for the user to access a service when using an unfamiliar or constrained input device.</t>
        <t>Some application protocols use passwords directly, whereas others reuse technologies that themselves process passwords (one example of such a technology is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer <xref target='RFC4422'/>).  Moreover, passwords are often carried by a sequence of protocols with backend authentication systems or data storage systems such as RADIUS <xref target='RFC2865'/> and LDAP <xref target='RFC4510'/>.  Developers of application protocols are encouraged to look into reusing these profiles instead of defining new ones, so that end-user expectations about passwords are consistent no matter which application protocol is used.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Interoperability Considerations" anchor='interop'>
      <t>Although strings that are consumed in PRECIS-based application protocols are often encoded using UTF-8 <xref target='RFC3629'/>, the exact encoding is a matter for the application protocol that uses PRECIS, not for the PRECIS framework.</t>
      <t>It is known that some existing systems are unable to support the full Unicode character set, or even any characters outside the ASCII range.  If two (or more) applications need to interoperate when exchanging data (e.g., for the purpose of authenticating a username or password), they will naturally need have in common at least one coded character set (as defined by <xref target='RFC6365'/>).  Establishing such a baseline is a matter for the application protocol that uses PRECIS, not for the PRECIS framework.</t>
      <t>The PRECIS framework, which is defined in terms of the latest version of Unicode as of the time of this writing (6.2), treats the character U+19DA NEW TAI LUE THAM as DISALLOWED.  Implementers need to be aware that this treatment is different from IDNA2008 (originally defined in terms of Unicode 5.2), which treats U+19DA as PVALID.</t>

<abstract><t>The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("PRECIS") defines several classes of strings for preparation and comparison.  In the framework, case mapping is defined because many protocols handle case-sensitive or case-insensitive string comparison and therefore preparation of the string is mandatory.  As described in the mapping for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement, mappings for internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width mapping and mapping of delimiters and other specials can be taken into consideration.  This document provides guidelines for authors of protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework and describes several mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to internationalized protocols.  The mappings described here are expected to be applied as Additional mapping in the PRECIS framework.</t></abstract>

<t>Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names to use characters outside the ASCII repertoire.  This document defines internationalized domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism called Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) for handling them in a standard fashion.  IDNs use characters drawn from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters to be represented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-called host names today.  This backward-compatible representation is required in existing protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no changes to the existing infrastructure.  IDNA is only meant for processing domain names, not free text. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8, the object of this memo.  UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.

<t>The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for providing authentication and data security services in connection-oriented protocols via replaceable mechanisms. It provides a structured interface between protocols and mechanisms. The resulting framework allows new protocols to reuse existing mechanisms and allows old protocols to make use of new mechanisms. The framework also provides a protocol for securing subsequent protocol exchanges within a data security layer.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document describes how a SASL mechanism is structured, describes how protocols include support for SASL, and defines the protocol for carrying a data security layer over a connection.

<t>This note describes issues raised by the deployment and use of Internationalized Domain Names.  It describes problems both at the time of registration and for use of those names in the DNS.  It recommends that IETF should update the RFCs relating to IDNs and a framework to be followed in doing so, as well as summarizing and identifying some work that is required outside the IETF.  In particular, it proposes that some changes be investigated for the Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) standard and its supporting tables, based on experience gained since those standards were completed.

<abstract>
<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t>&lt;t> In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 2434.

<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from user input were mapped into a set of Unicode code points that "made sense", and then encoded and passed to the domain name system (DNS).  The IDNA2008 protocol (described in RFCs 5890, 5891, 5892, and 5893) presumes that the input to the protocol comes from a set of "permitted" code points, which it then encodes and passes to the DNS, but does not specify what to do with the result of user input.  This document describes the actions that can be taken by an implementation between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to the new IDNA protocol.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract></front>

<t>If a protocol expects to compare two strings and is prepared only for those strings to be ASCII, then using Unicode code points in those strings requires they be prepared somehow.  Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (here called IDNA2003) defined and used Stringprep and Nameprep.  Other protocols subsequently defined Stringprep profiles.  A new approach different from Stringprep and Nameprep is used for a revision of IDNA2003 (called IDNA2008).  Other Stringprep profiles need to be similarly updated, or a replacement of Stringprep needs to be designed.  This document outlines the issues to be faced by those designing a Stringprep replacement.</t></abstract></front>

<date year='2013' month='May' />
<abstract>
<t>Identifiers such as hostnames, URIs, IP addresses, and email addresses are often used in security contexts to identify security principals and resources.  In such contexts, an identifier presented via some protocol is often compared using some policy to make security decisions such as whether the security principal may access the resource, what level of authentication or encryption is required, etc.  If the parties involved in a security decision use different algorithms to compare identifiers, then failure scenarios ranging from denial of service to elevation of privilege can result.  This document provides a discussion of these issues that designers should consider when defining identifiers and protocols, and when constructing architectures that use multiple protocols.</t></abstract></front>

   PRECIS Framework: Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized
                    Strings in Application Protocols
                     draft-ietf-precis-framework-06

Abstract

   Application protocols using Unicode code points in protocol strings
   need to prepare such strings in order to perform comparison
   operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or authorization).
   This document defines a framework enabling application protocols to
   perform the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings
   (a.k.a.  "PRECIS") in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode
   code points and thus is agile with respect to versions of Unicode.
   As a result, this framework provides a more sustainable approach to
   the handling of internationalized strings than the previous
   framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  A specification that
   reuses this framework can either directly use the base string classes
   or subclass the base string classes as needed.  This framework takes
   an approach similar to the revised internationalized domain names in
   applications (IDNA) technology (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC
   5893, RFC 5894) and thus adheres to the high-level design goals
   described in RFC 4690, albeit for application technologies other than
   the Domain Name System (DNS).  This document obsoletes RFC 3454.

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


1.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement], many IETF
   protocols have used the Stringprep framework [RFC3454] as the basis
   for preparing and comparing protocol strings that contain Unicode
   code points [UNICODE].  The Stringprep framework was developed during
   work on the original technology for internationalized domain names
   (IDNs), here called "IDNA2003" [RFC3490], and Nameprep [RFC3491] was
   the Stringprep profile for IDNs.  At the time, Stringprep was
   designed as a general framework so that other application protocols
   could define their own Stringprep profiles for the preparation and
   comparison of strings and identifiers, and a number of application
   protocols did define such profiles.

   After the publication of [RFC3454] in 2002, several significant
   issues arose with the use of Stringprep in the IDN case, as
   documented in [RFC4690] (most significantly, Stringprep was tied to
   Unicode version 3.2).  Therefore, the new IDNA specifications, here
   called "IDNA2008" ([RFC5890], [RFC5891], [RFC5892], [RFC5893],
   [RFC5894]), no longer use Stringprep and Nameprep.  This migration
   away from Stringprep for IDNs has prompted other "customers" of
   Stringprep to consider new approaches to the preparation and
   comparison of internationalized strings (a.k.a.  "PRECIS"), as
   described in [I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement].

   This document defines a framework for a post-Stringprep approach to
   the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings in
   application protocols, based on several principles:

   1.  Define a small set of base string classes appropriate for common
       application protocol constructs such as usernames and free-form
       strings.

   2.  Define each base string class in terms of Unicode code points and
       their properties so that an algorithm can be used to determine
       whether each code point or character category is valid,
       disallowed, or unassigned.

   3.  Define string classes in terms of allowable code points, so that
       any code points not explicitly allowed are forbidden.

   4.  Enable application protocols to subclass the base string classes
       if needed, mainly to disallow particular code points that are
       currently disallowed in the relevant application protocol (e.g.,
       characters with special or reserved meaning, such as "@" and "/"
       when used as separators within identifiers).

   5.  Leave various mapping operations (e.g., case preservation or
       lowercasing, Unicode normalization, mapping of certain characters
       to nothing, handling of right-to-left characters) as the
       responsibility of application protocols, as was done for IDNA2008
       through an IDNA-specific mapping document [RFC5895].

   It is expected that this framework will yield the following benefits:

   o  Application protocols will be more version-agile with regard to
      the Unicode database.
   o  Implementers will be able to share code point tables and software
      code across application protocols, most likely by means of
      software libraries.
   o  End users will be able to acquire more accurate expectations about
      the code points that are acceptable in various contexts.  Given
      this more uniform set of string classes, it is also expected that
      copy/paste operations between software implementing different
      application protocols will be more predictable and coherent.

   Although this framework is similar to IDNA2008 and borrows some of
   the character categories defined in [RFC5892], it defines additional
   string classes and character categories to meet the needs of common
   application protocols.


2.  Terminology

   Many important terms used in this document are defined in [RFC5890],
   [RFC6365], [I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement], and [UNICODE].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  String Classes

3.1.  Overview

   IDNA2008 essentially defines a base string class of internationalized
   domain name, although it does not use the term "string class".  (This
   document does not define a string class for domain names, and
   application protocols are strongly encouraged to use IDNA2008 as the
   appropriate method to prepare domain names and hostnames.)  Because
   the IDN string class is designed to meet the particular requirements
   of the Domain Name System (DNS), additional string classes are needed
   for non-DNS applications.

   Starting in 2010, various "customers" of Stringprep began to discuss
   the need to define a post-Stringprep approach to the preparation and
   comparison of internationalized strings.  As a result of analyzing
   existing Stringprep profiles, this community concluded that most
   existing uses could be addressed by two base string classes:

   NameClass:  a sequence of letters, numbers, and symbols that is used
      to identify or address a network entity such as a user account, a
      venue (e.g., a chatroom), an information source (e.g., a data
      feed), or a collection of data (e.g., a file); the intent is that
      this class will be very safe for use in a wide variety of
      application protocols, with the result that safety has been
      prioritized over inclusiveness for this class.

   FreeClass:  a sequence of letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, and
      other code points that is used for free-form strings, including
      passwords as well as display elements such as human-friendly
      nicknames in chatrooms; the intent is that this class will allow
      nearly any Unicode character, with the result that inclusiveness
      has been prioritized over safety for this class (e.g., protocol
      designers, application developers, service providers, and end
      users might not understand or be able to enter all of the
      characters that can be included in the FreeClass).

   Although members of the community discussed the possibility of
   defining other bases string classes (e.g., a class falling somewhere
   between the NameClass and the FreeClass), they concluded that the
   NameClass would be a safe choice meeting the needs of many or even
   most application protocols, and that protocols needing a wider range
   of Unicode characters could use the FreeClass directly or subclass it
   if needed.

   The following subsections discuss the NameClass and FreeClass in more
   detail, with reference to the dimensions described in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement].  (Naturally, future documents
   can define base string classes beyond the NameClass and FreeClass;
   see Section 10.2.)  Each string class (or a particular usage thereof)
   is defined by the following behavioral rules:

   Valid:  defines which code points and character categories are
      treated as valid input to the string.

   Disallowed:  defines which code points and character categories are
      treated as disallowed for the string.

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   Unassigned:  defines application behavior in the presence of code
      points that are unassigned, i.e. unknown for the version of
      Unicode the application is built upon.

   Normalization:  defines which Unicode normalization form (D, KD, C,
      or KC) is to be applied (see [UAX15]).

   Casemapping:  specifies if casemapping is performed (instead of case
      preservation), and how the mapping is done (e.g., mapping
      uppercase and titlecase characters to their lowercase
      equivalents).

   Directionality:  defines application behavior in the presence of code
      points that have directionality, in particular right-to-left code
      points as defined in the Unicode database (see [UAX9]).

   This document defines the valid, disallowed, and unassigned rules for
   the NameClass and FreeClass.  Application protocols that use these
   string classes are responsible for defining the normalization,
   casemapping, and directionality rules, as well as any additional
   mappings to be applied (e.g., mapping fullwidth and halfwidth
   characters to their decomposition equivalents).

   NOTE: In order to ensure proper comparison, any normalization MUST be
   completed before the application of additional mappings or the
   process of checking whether a code point is valid, disallowed, or
   unassigned.

3.2.  NameClass

   Most application technologies need strings that can be used to refer
   to, include, or communicate things like usernames, file names, data
   feed names, and chatroom names.  We group such things into a class
   called "NameClass" having the following features.

3.2.1.  Valid

   o  Code points traditionally used as letters and numbers in writing
      systems, i.e., the LetterDigits ("A") category first defined in
      [RFC5892] and listed here under Section 6.1.
   o  Code points in the range U+0021 through U+007E, i.e., the ASCII7
      ("K") rule defined under Section 6.11.  These code points are
      "grandfathered" into PRECIS and thus are valid even if they would
      otherwise be disallowed according to the property-based rules
      specified in the next section.

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


3.2.2.  Disallowed

   o  Control characters, i.e., the Controls ("L") category defined
      under Section 6.12.
   o  Ignorable characters, i.e., the PrecisIgnorableProperties ("M")
      category defined under Section 6.13.
   o  Space characters, i.e., the Spaces ("N") category defined under
      Section 6.14.
   o  Symbol characters, i.e., the Symbols ("O") category defined under
      Section 6.15.
   o  Punctuation characters, i.e., the Punctuation ("P") category
      defined under Section 6.16.
   o  Any character that has a compatibility equivalent, i.e., the
      HasCompat ("Q") category defined under Section 6.17.  These code
      points are disallowed even if they would otherwise be valid
      according to the property-based rules specified in the previous
      section.
   o  Letters and digits other than the "traditional" letters and digits
      allowed in IDNs, i.e., the OtherLetterDigits ("R") category
      defined under Section 6.18.

3.2.3.  Unassigned

   Any code points that are not yet assigned in the Unicode character
   set SHALL be considered Unassigned for purposes of the NameClass.

3.2.4.  Normalization

   The Unicode normalization form MUST be specified by each application
   protocol that uses or subclasses the NameClass.

   However, in accordance with [RFC5198], normalization form C (NFC) is
   RECOMMENDED.

3.2.5.  Casemapping

   The casemapping rule MUST be specified by each application protocol
   that uses or subclasses the NameClass.

3.2.6.  Additional Mappings

   Additional mapping rules (if any) MUST be specified by each
   application protocol that uses or subclasses the NameClass.

3.2.7.  Directionality

   The directionality rule MUST be specified by each application
   protocol that uses or subclasses the NameClass.

3.3.  FreeClass

   Some application technologies need strings that can be used in a
   free-form way, e.g., as a password in an authentication exchange (see
   [I-D.melnikov-precis-saslprepbis] or a nickname in a chatroom (see
   [I-D.ietf-precis-nickname]).  We group such things into a class
   called "FreeClass" having the following features.

   NOTE: Consult Section 9.6 for relevant security considerations when
   strings conforming to the FreeClass, or a subclass thereof, are used
   as passwords.

3.3.1.  Valid

   o  Traditional letters and numbers, i.e., the LetterDigits ("A")
      category first defined in [RFC5892] and listed here under
      Section 6.1.
   o  Letters and digits other than the "traditional" letters and digits
      allowed in IDNs, i.e., the OtherLetterDigits ("R") category
      defined under Section 6.18.
   o  Code points in the range U+0021 through U+007E, i.e., the ASCII7
      ("K") rule defined under Section 6.11.
   o  Any character that has a compatibility equivalent, i.e., the
      HasCompat ("Q") category defined under Section 6.17.
   o  Space characters, i.e., the Spaces ("N") category defined under
      Section 6.14.
   o  Symbol characters, i.e., the Symbols ("O") category defined under
      Section 6.15.
   o  Punctuation characters, i.e., the Punctuation ("P") category
      defined under Section 6.16.

3.3.2.  Disallowed

   o  Control characters, i.e., the Controls ("L") category defined
      under Section 6.12.
   o  Ignorable characters, i.e., the PrecisIgnorableProperties ("M")
      category defined under Section 6.13.

3.3.3.  Unassigned

   Any code points that are not yet assigned in the Unicode character
   set SHALL be considered Unassigned for purposes of the FreeClass.

3.3.4.  Normalization

   The Unicode normalization form MUST be specified by each application
   protocol that uses or subclasses the FreeClass.

   However, in accordance with [RFC5198], normalization form C (NFC) is
   RECOMMENDED.

3.3.5.  Casemapping

   The casemapping rule MUST be specified by each application protocol
   that uses or subclasses the FreeClass.

   In general, the combination of case preservation and case-insensitive
   comparison of internationalized strings is NOT RECOMMENDED; instead,
   application protocols SHOULD either (a) not preserve case but perform
   case-insensitive comparison or (b) preserve case but perform case-
   sensitive comparison.

   In order to maximize entropy and minimize the potential for false
   positives, it is NOT RECOMMENDED for application protocols to map
   uppercase and titlecase code points to their lowercase equivalents
   when strings conforming to the FreeClass, or a subclass thereof, are
   used in passwords; instead, it is RECOMMENDED to preserve the case of
   all code points contained in such strings and then perform case-
   sensitive comparison.  See also the related discussion in
   [I-D.melnikov-precis-saslprepbis].

3.3.6.  Additional Mappings

   Additional mapping rules (if any) MUST be specified by each
   application protocol that uses or subclasses the FreeClass.

3.3.7.  Directionality

   The directionality rule MUST be specified by each application
   protocol that uses or subclasses the FreeClass.


4.  Use of PRECIS String Classes

4.1.  Principles

   This document defines the valid, disallowed, and unassigned rules.
   Application protocols that use the PRECIS string classes MUST define
   the normalization, casemapping, and directionality rules.  Such
   definitions MUST at a minimum specify the following:

   Normalization:  Which Unicode normalization form (D, KD, C, or KC) is
      to be applied (see [UAX15] for background information); in
      accordance with [RFC5198], NFC is RECOMMENDED.

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   Casemapping:  Whether uppercase and titlecase code points are to be
      (a) preserved or (b) mapped to lowercase.

   Additional Mappings:  Whether additional mappings are to be applied,
      such as mapping fullwidth and halfwidth characters to their
      decomposition mappings, mapping non-ASCII space characters to
      ASCII space, or mapping certain characters to nothing.

   Directionality:  Whether any instance of the class that contains a
      right-to-left code point is to be considered a right-to-left
      string, or whether some other rule is to be applied (e.g., the
      "Bidi Rule" from [RFC5893]).

4.2.  Subclassing

   Application protocols are allowed to subclass the base string classes
   specified in this document.  As the word "subclass" implies, a
   subclass MUST NOT add as valid any code points or character
   categories that are disallowed by the base string class.  However, a
   subclass MAY do either of the following:

   1.  Exclude specific code points that are included in the base string
       class.
   2.  Exclude characters matching certain Unicode properties (e.g.,
       math symbols) that are included in the base string class.

   As a result, code points that are defined as valid for the base
   string class being subclassed will be defined as disallowed for the
   subclass.

   Application protocols that subclass the PRECIS string classes MUST
   register with the IANA as described under Section 10.3.

   It is RECOMMENDED for subclass names to be of the form
   "SubclassBaseClass", where the "Subclass" string is a differentiator
   and "BaseClass" is the name of the base class being subclassed; for
   example, the subclass of the NameClass used for localparts in the
   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is named
   "LocalpartNameClass" [I-D.ietf-xmpp-6122bis].

4.3.  A Note about Spaces

   The NameClass does not allow spaces of any kind (even ASCII space,
   U+0020).  This might be counter-intuitive, given that spaces are
   included between family names and personal names when representing
   the full names of people (and full names might be used as usernames).
   The consensus of the PRECIS Working Group is that spaces are
   problematic for many reasons, for example because in some locales



Saint-Andre & Blanchet   Expires March 27, 2013                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   some devices are known to generate a character other than ASCII space
   (such as ZERO WIDTH JOINER, U+200D) when a user performs an action
   like hit the space bar on a keyboard.  Working Group participants
   also raised concerns about the fact that spaces are not always
   visible, and that many Unicode characters might be confusable with
   ASCII space.

   Although some existing protocols, such as the Simple Authentication
   and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422], might be used in ways that allow
   a username to include spaces, the sense of the Working Group was that
   such protocols could define an application-layer construct that
   consists of instances of the PRECIS NameClass separated from each
   other by instances of the ASCII space character (U+0020).  One
   consequence of this approach might be to effectively discourage the
   use of ASCII space (or, even more problematically, non-ASCII space
   characters) in newer application protocols; given the challenges
   involved in properly handling space characters in usernames,
   identifiers, and other protocol strings, the Working Group considered
   this to be a feature, not a bug.


5.  Code Point Properties

   In order to implement the string classes described above, this
   document does the following:

   1.  Reviews and classifies the collections of code points in the
       Unicode character set by examining various code point properties.

   2.  Defines an algorithm for determining a derived property value,
       which can vary depending on the string class being used by the
       relevant application protocol.

   This document is not intended to specify precisely how derived
   property values are to be applied in protocol strings.  That
   information is the responsibility of the protocol specification that
   uses or subclasses a base string class from this document.

   The value of the property is to be interpreted as follows.

   PROTOCOL VALID  Those code points that are allowed to be used in any
      PRECIS string class (NameClass and FreeClass).  Code points with
      this property value are permitted for general use in any string
      class.  The abbreviated term PVALID is used to refer to this value
      in the remainder of this document.






Saint-Andre & Blanchet   Expires March 27, 2013                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   SPECIFIC CLASS PROTOCOL VALID  Those code points that are allowed to
      be used in specific string classes.  Code points with this
      property value are permitted for use in specific string classes.
      In the remainder of this document, the abbreviated term *_PVAL is
      used, where * = (NAME | FREE), i.e., either FREE_PVAL or
      NAME_PVAL.

   CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED  Some characteristics of the character, such
      as its being invisible in certain contexts or problematic in
      others, require that it not be used in labels unless specific
      other characters or properties are present.  The abbreviated term
      CONTEXT is used to refer to this value in the remainder of this
      document.  As in IDNA2008, there are two subdivisions of
      CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED, the first for Join_controls (called
      CONTEXTJ) and the second for other characters (called CONTEXTO).

   DISALLOWED  Those code points that must not permitted in any PRECIS
      string class.

   SPECIFIC CLASS DISALLOWED  Those code points that are not to be
      included in a specific string class.  Code points with this
      property value are not permitted in one of the string classes but
      might be permitted in others.  In the remainder of this document,
      the abbreviated term *_DIS is used, where * = (NAME | FREE), i.e.,
      either FREE_DIS or NAME_DIS.

   UNASSIGNED  Those code points that are not designated (i.e. are
      unassigned) in the Unicode Standard.

   The mechanisms described here allow determination of the value of the
   property for future versions of Unicode (including characters added
   after Unicode 5.2 or 6.1 depending on the category, since some
   categories in this document are reused from IDNA2008 and therefore
   were defined at the time of Unicode 5.2).  Changes in Unicode
   properties that do not affect the outcome of this process do not
   affect this framework.  For example, a character can have its Unicode
   General_Category value [UNICODE] change from So to Sm, or from Lo to
   Ll, without affecting the algorithm results.  Moreover, even if such
   changes were to result, the BackwardCompatible list (Section 6.7) can
   be adjusted to ensure the stability of the results.

   Some code points need to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, but
   ought to be excluded in all other cases; these rules are also
   described in other documents.  The most notable of these are the Join
   Control characters, U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and U+200C ZERO WIDTH
   NON-JOINER.  Both of them have the derived property value CONTEXTJ.
   A character with the derived property value CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO
   (CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED) is not to be used unless an appropriate

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   rule has been established and the context of the character is
   consistent with that rule.  It is invalid to generate a string
   containing these characters unless such a contextual rule is found
   and satisfied.  PRECIS does not define its own contextual rules, but
   instead re-uses the contextual rules defined for IDNA2008; please see
   Appendix A of [RFC5892] for more information.


6.  Category Definitions Used to Calculate Derived Property Value

   The derived property obtains its value based on a two-step procedure:

   1.  Characters are placed in one or more character categories either
       (1) based on core properties defined by the Unicode Standard or
       (2) by treating the code point as an exception and addressing the
       code point based on its code point value.  These categories are
       not mutually exclusive.

   2.  Set operations are used with these categories to determine the
       values for a property that is specific to a given string class.
       These operations are specified under Section 7.

   (NOTE: Unicode property names and property value names might have
   short abbreviations, such as "gc" for the General_Category property
   and "Ll" for the Lowercase_Letter property value of the gc property.)

   In the following specification of character categories, the operation
   that returns the value of a particular Unicode character property for
   a code point is designated by using the formal name of that property
   (from the Unicode PropertyAliases.txt [1]) followed by '(cp)' for
   "code point".  For example, the value of the General_Category
   property for a code point is indicated by General_Category(cp).

   The first ten categories (A-J) shown below were previously defined
   for IDNA2008 and are copied directly from [RFC5892].  Some of these
   categories are reused in PRECIS and some of them are not; however,
   the lettering of categories is retained to prevent overlap and to
   ease implementation of both IDNA2008 and PRECIS in a single software
   application.  The next seven categories (K-Q) are specific to PRECIS.

6.1.  LetterDigits (A)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] and copied here for use
   in PRECIS.

   A: General_Category(cp) is in {Ll, Lu, Lm, Lo, Mn, Mc, Nd}

   These rules identify characters commonly used in mnemonics and often

   informally described as "language characters".

   For more information, see section 4.5 of [UNICODE].

   The categories used in this rule are:
   o  Ll - Lowercase_Letter
   o  Lu - Uppercase_Letter
   o  Lm - Modifier_Letter
   o  Lo - Other_Letter
   o  Mn - Nonspacing_Mark
   o  Mc - Spacing_Mark
   o  Nd - Decimal_Number

6.2.  Unstable (B)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] but not used in PRECIS.

6.3.  IgnorableProperties (C)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] but not used in PRECIS.
   See the "PrecisIgnorableProperties (M)" category below for a more
   inclusive category used in PRECIS identifiers.

6.4.  IgnorableBlocks (D)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] but not used in PRECIS.

6.5.  LDH (E)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] but not used in PRECIS.
   See the "ASCII7 (K)" category below for a more inclusive category
   used in PRECIS identifiers.

6.6.  Exceptions (F)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] and used in PRECIS to
   ensure consistent treatment of the relevant code points.

   F: cp is in {00B7, 00DF, 0375, 03C2, 05F3, 05F4, 0640, 0660,
                0661, 0662, 0663, 0664, 0665, 0666, 0667, 0668,
                0669, 06F0, 06F1, 06F2, 06F3, 06F4, 06F5, 06F6,
                06F7, 06F8, 06F9, 06FD, 06FE, 07FA, 0F0B, 3007,
                302E, 302F, 3031, 3032, 3033, 3034, 3035, 303B,
                30FB}

   This category explicitly lists code points for which the category
   cannot be assigned using only the core property values that exist in
   the Unicode standard.  The values are according to the table below:

6.7.  BackwardCompatible (G)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] and copied here for use
   in PRECIS.  Because of how the PRECIS string classes are defined,
   only changes that would result in code points being added to or
   removed from the LetterDigits ("A") category would result in
   backward-incompatible modifications to code point assignments.
   Therefore, management of this category is handled via the processes
   specified in [RFC5892].

   G: cp is in {}

   This category includes the code points for which property values in
   versions of Unicode after 5.2 have changed in such a way that the
   derived property value would no longer be PVALID or DISALLOWED.  If
   changes are made to future versions of Unicode so that code points
   might change property value from PVALID or DISALLOWED, then this
   table can be updated and keep special exception values so that the
   property values for code points stay stable.

6.8.  JoinControl (H)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] and copied here for use
   in PRECIS.

   H: Join_Control(cp) = True

   This category consists of Join Control characters (i.e., they are not
   in LetterDigits (Section 6.1) but are still required in strings under
   some circumstances).

6.9.  OldHangulJamo (I)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] and copied here for use
   in PRECIS.

   Vowel Jamo, and Trailing Jamo).

   characters results in restricting the set of Korean PVALID characters
   just to preformed, modern Hangul syllable characters.  Old Hangul
   syllables, which must be spelled with sequences of conjoining Hangul
   Jamos, are not PVALID for string classes.

6.10.  Unassigned (J)

   NOTE: This category is defined in [RFC5892] and copied here for use
   in PRECIS.

   J: General_Category(cp) is in {Cn} and
      Noncharacter_Code_Point(cp) = False

   This category consists of code points in the Unicode character set
   that are not (yet) assigned.  It should be noted that Unicode
   distinguishes between 'unassigned code points' and 'unassigned
   characters'.  The unassigned code points are all but (Cn -
   Noncharacters), while the unassigned *characters* are all but (Cn +
   Cs).

6.11.  ASCII7 (K)

   This PRECIS-specific category exempts most characters in the ASCII-7
   range from other rules that might be applied during PRECIS
   processing, on the assumption that these code points are in such wide
   use that disallowing them would be counter-productive.

   K: cp is in {0021..007E}

6.12.  Controls (L)

   L: Control(cp) = True

6.13.  PrecisIgnorableProperties (M)

      Noncharacter_Code_Point(cp) = True

   The definition for Default_Ignorable_Code_Point can be found in the

6.14.  Spaces (N)

   This PRECIS-specific category is used to group code points that are
   space characters.

   N: General_Category(cp) is in {Zs}

6.15.  Symbols (O)

   This PRECIS-specific category is used to group code points that are
   symbols.

   O: General_Category(cp) is in {Sm, Sc, Sk, So}

6.16.  Punctuation (P)

   This PRECIS-specific category is used to group code points that are
   punctuation characters.

   P: General_Category(cp) is in {Pc, Pd, Ps, Pe, Pi, Pf, Po}

6.17.  HasCompat (Q)

   This PRECIS-specific category is used to group code points that have
   compatibility equivalents as explained in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of
   [UNICODE].

   Q: toNFKC(cp) != cp

   The toNFKC() operation returns the code point in normalization form
   KC.  For more information, see Section 5 of [UAX15].

6.18.  OtherLetterDigits (R)

   This PRECIS-specific category is used to group code points that are
   letters and digits other than the "traditional" letters and digits
   grouped under the LetterDigits (A) class (see Section 6.1).

   R: General_Category(cp) is in {Lt, Nl, No, Me}

7.  Calculation of the Derived Property

   Possible values of the derived property are:

   o  PVALID
   o  NAME_PVAL
   o  FREE_PVAL
   o  CONTEXTJ
   o  CONTEXTO
   o  DISALLOWED
   o  NAME_DIS
   o  FREE_DIS
   o  UNASSIGNED

   NOTE: The value of the derived property calculated can depend on the
   string class; for example, if an identifier used in an application
   protocol is defined as using or subclassing the PRECIS NameClass then
   a space character such as U+0020 would be assigned to NAME_DIS,
   whereas if an identifier is defined as using or subclassing the
   PRECIS FreeClass then the character would be assigned to FREE_PVAL.
   For the sake of brevity, the designation "FREE_PVAL" is used in the
   code point tables, instead of the longer designation "NAME_DIS or
   FREE_PVAL".  In practice, the derived properties NAME_PVAL and
   FREE_DIS are not used in this specification, since every NAME_PVAL
   code point is PVALID and every FREE_DIS code point is DISALLOWED.

   The algorithm to calculate the value of the derived property is as
   follows.  (NOTE: Use of the name of a rule (such as "Exception")
   implies the set of code points that the rule defines, whereas the
   same name as a function call (such as "Exception(cp)") implies the
   value that the code point has in the Exceptions table.)

   If .cp. .in. Exceptions Then Exceptions(cp);
   Else If .cp. .in. BackwardCompatible Then BackwardCompatible(cp);
   Else If .cp. .in. Unassigned Then UNASSIGNED;
   Else If .cp. .in. ASCII7 Then PVALID;
   Else If .cp. .in. JoinControl Then CONTEXTJ;
   Else If .cp. .in. PrecisIgnorableProperties Then DISALLOWED;
   Else If .cp. .in. Controls Then DISALLOWED;

8.  Code Points

   The Categories and Rules defined under Section 6 and Section 7 apply
   to all Unicode code points.  The table in Appendix A shows, for
   illustrative purposes, the consequences of the categories and
   classification rules, and the resulting property values.

   The list of code points that can be found in Appendix A is non-
   normative.  Instead, the rules defined by Section 6 and Section 7 are
   normative, and any tables are derived from the rules.


9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  General Issues

   The security of applications that use this framework can depend in
   part on the proper preparation and comparison of internationalized
   strings.  For example, such strings can be used to make
   authentication and authorization decisions, and the security of an
   application could be compromised if an entity providing a given
   string is connected to the wrong account or online resource based on
   different interpretations of the string.

   Specifications of application protocols that use this framework are
   encouraged to describe how internationalized strings are used in the
   protocol, including the security implications of any false positives
   and false negatives that might result from various comparison
   operations.  For some helpful guidelines, refer to
   [I-D.iab-identifier-comparison], [RFC5890], [UTR36], and [UTR39].

9.2.  Use of the NameClass

   Strings that conform to the NameClass and any subclass thereof are
   intended to be relatively safe for use in a broad range of
   applications, primarily because they include only letters, digits,
   and "grandfathered" non-space characters from the ASCII range; thus
   they exclude spaces, characters with compatibility equivalents, and
   almost all symbols and punctuation marks.  However, because such
   strings can still include so-called confusable characters (see
   Section 9.5, protocol designers and implementers are encouraged to
   pay close attention to the security considerations described
   elsewhere in this document.

9.3.  Use of the FreeClass

   Strings that conform to the FreeClass and many subclasses thereof can
   include virtually any Unicode character.  This makes the FreeClass



Saint-Andre & Blanchet   Expires March 27, 2013                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   quite expressive, but also problematic from the perspective of
   possible user confusion.  Protocol designers are hereby warned that
   the FreeClass contains codepoints they might not understand, and are
   encouraged to use or subclass the NameClass wherever feasible;
   however, if an application protocol requires more code points than
   are allowed by the NameClass, protocol designers are encouraged to
   define a subclass of the FreeClass that restricts the allowable code
   points as tightly as possible.  (The working group considered the
   option of allowing superclasses as well as subclasses of PRECIS
   string classes, but decided against allowing superclasses to reduce
   the likelihood of security and interoperability problems.)

9.4.  Local Character Set Issues

   When systems use local character sets other than ASCII and Unicode,
   these specifications leave the problem of converting between the
   local character set and Unicode up to the application or local
   system.  If different applications (or different versions of one
   application) implement different rules for conversions among coded
   character sets, they could interpret the same name differently and
   contact different application servers or other network entities.
   This problem is not solved by security protocols, such as Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] and the Simple Authentication and
   Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422], that do not take local character
   sets into account.

9.5.  Visually Similar Characters

   Some characters are visually similar and thus can cause confusion
   among humans.  Such characters are often called "confusable
   characters" or "confusables".

   The problem of confusable characters is not necessarily caused by the
   use of Unicode code points outside the ASCII range.  For example, in
   some presentations and to some individuals the string "ju1iet"
   (spelled with the Arabic numeral one as the third character) might
   appear to be the same as "juliet" (spelled with the lowercase version
   of the letter "L"), especially on casual visual inspection.  This
   phenomenon is sometimes called "typejacking".

   However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full
   range of Unicode code points into protocol strings.  For example, the
   characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2 from the
   Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they
   might look when presented using a "creative" font family.

   In some examples of confusable characters, it is unlikely that the
   average human could tell the difference between the real string and



Saint-Andre & Blanchet   Expires March 27, 2013                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   the fake string.  (Indeed, there is no programmatic way to
   distinguish with full certainty which is the fake string and which is
   the real string; in some contexts, the string formed of Cherokee
   characters might be the real string and the string formed of ASCII
   characters might be the fake string.)  Because PRECIS-compliant
   strings can contain almost any properly-encoded Unicode code point,
   it can be relatively easy to fake or mimic some strings in systems
   that use the PRECIS framework.  The fact that some strings are easily
   confused introduces security vulnerabilities of the kind that have
   also plagued the World Wide Web, specifically the phenomenon known as
   phishing.

   Despite the fact that some specific suggestions about identification
   and handling of confusable characters appear in the Unicode Security
   Considerations [UTR36], it is also true (as noted in [RFC5890]) that
   "there are no comprehensive technical solutions to the problems of
   confusable characters".  Because it is impossible to map visually
   similar characters without a great deal of context (such as knowing
   the font families used), the PRECIS framework does nothing to map
   similar-looking characters together, nor does it prohibit some
   characters because they look like others.

   Nevertheless, specifications for application protocols that use this
   framework MUST describe how confusable characters can be used to
   compromise the security of systems that use the protocol in question,
   along with any protocol-specific suggestions for overcoming those
   threats.  In particular, software implementations and service
   deployments that use PRECIS-based technologies are strongly
   encouraged to define and implement consistent policies regarding the
   registration, storage, and presentation of visually similar
   characters.  The following recommendations are appropriate:

   1.  An application service SHOULD define a policy that specifies the
       scripts or blocks of characters that the service will allow to be
       registered (e.g., in an account name) or stored (e.g., in a file
       name).  Such a policy SHOULD be informed by the languages and
       scripts that are used to write registered account names; in
       particular, to reduce confusion, the service SHOULD forbid
       registration or storage of stings that contain characters from
       more than one script and SHOULD restrict registrations to
       characters drawn from a very small number of scripts (e.g.,
       scripts that are well-understood by the administrators of the
       service, to improve manageability).

   2.  User-oriented application software SHOULD define a policy that
       specifies how internationalized strings will be presented to a
       human user.  Because every human user of such software has a
       preferred language or a small set of preferred languages, the



Saint-Andre & Blanchet   Expires March 27, 2013                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


       software SHOULD gather that information either explicitly from
       the user or implicitly via the operating system of the user's
       device.  Furthermore, because most languages are typically
       represented by a single script or a small set of scripts, and
       because most scripts are typically contained in one or more
       blocks of characters, the software SHOULD warn the user when
       presenting a string that mixes characters from more than one
       script or block, or that uses characters outside the normal range
       of the user's preferred language(s).  (Such a recommendation is
       not intended to discourage communication across different
       communities of language users; instead, it recognizes the
       existence of such communities and encourages due caution when
       presenting unfamiliar scripts or characters to human users.)

9.6.  Security of Passwords

   Two goals of passwords are to maximize the amount of entropy and to
   minimize the potential for false positives.  These goals can be
   achieved in part by allowing a wide range of code points and by
   ensuring that passwords are handled in such a way that code points
   are not compared aggressively.  Therefore, it is NOT RECOMMENDED for
   application protocols to subclass the FreeClass for use in passwords
   in a way that removes entire categories (e.g., by disallowing symbols
   or punctuation).  Furthermore, it is NOT RECOMMENDED for application
   protocols to map uppercase and titlecase code points to their
   lowercase equivalents in such strings; instead, it is RECOMMENDED to
   preserve the case of all code points contained in such strings and to
   compare them in a case-sensitive manner.

   That said, software implementers need to be aware that there exist
   tradeoffs between entropy and usability.  For example, allowing a
   user to establish a password containing "uncommon" code points might
   make it difficult for the user to access a service when using an
   unfamiliar or constrained input device.

   Some application protocols use passwords directly, whereas others
   reuse technologies that themselves process passwords (one example of
   such a technology is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
   [RFC4422]).  Moreover, passwords are often carried by a sequence of
   protocols with backend authentication systems or data storage systems
   such as RADIUS [RFC2865] and LDAP [RFC4510].  Developers of
   application protocols are encouraged to look into reusing these
   profiles instead of defining new ones, so that end-user expectations
   about passwords are consistent no matter which application protocol
   is used.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  PRECIS Derived Property Value Registry

   IANA is requested to create a PRECIS-specific registry with the
   Derived Properties for the versions of Unicode that are released
   after (and including) version 6.1.  The derived property value is to
   be calculated in cooperation with a designated expert [RFC5226]
   according to the rules specified under Section 6 and Section 7, not
   by copying the non-normative table found under Appendix A.

   The IESG is to be notified if backward-incompatible changes to the
   table of derived properties are discovered or if other problems arise
   during the process of creating the table of derived property values
   or during expert review.  Changes to the rules defined under
   Section 6 and Section 7) require IETF Review, as described in
   [RFC5226].

10.2.  PRECIS Base Classes Registry

   IANA is requested to create a registry of PRECIS base string classes.
   In accordance with [RFC5226], the registration policy is "RFC
   Required".

   The registration template is as follows:

   Base Class:  [the name of the base class]
   Description:  [a brief description of the base class and its intended
      use, e.g., "A sequence of letters, numbers, and symbols that is
      used to identify or address a network entity."]
   Normalization:  [which Unicode normalization form is applied, e.g.,
      "NFC"; or "Application Specific" if to be defined by protocols
      that use the base class]
   Casemapping:  [the behavioral rule for handling of case, e.g., "Map
      uppercase and titlecase characters to lowercase."; or "Application
      Specific" if to be defined by protocols that use the base class]
   Additional Mappings:  [any additional mappings are required or
      recommended, e.g., "Map non-ASCII space characters to ASCII
      space."; or "Application Specific" if to be defined by protocols
      that use the base class]
   Directionality:  [the behavioral rule for handling of right-to-left
      code points, e.g., "The 'Bidi Rule' defined in RFC 5893 applies.";
      or "Application Specific" if to be defined by protocols that use
      the base class]

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   Specification:  [the RFC number]

   The initial registrations are as follows:

   Base Class: FreeClass.
   Description: A sequence of letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, and
         other code points that is used for free-form strings.
   Normalization: Application Specific.
   Casemapping: Application Specific.
   Additional Mappings: Application Specific.
   Directionality: Application Specific.
   Specification: RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please change XXXX to
                  the number issued for this specification.]

   Base Class: NameClass.
   Description: A sequence of letters, numbers, and symbols that is
         used to identify or address a network entity.
   Normalization: Application Specific.
   Casemapping: Application Specific.
   Additional Mappings: Application Specific.
   Directionality: Application Specific.
   Specification: RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please change XXXX to
                  the number issued for this specification.]

10.3.  PRECIS Subclasses Registry

   IANA is requested to create a registry of subclasses that use the
   PRECIS base string classes.  In accordance with [RFC5226], the
   registration policy is "Expert Review".  This policy was chosen in
   order to ensure that "customers" of PRECIS receive appropriate
   guidance regarding the sometimes complex and subtle
   internationalization issues related to subclassing of PRECIS base
   classes.

   The registration template is as follows:

   Subclass:  [the name of the subclass]
   Base Class:  [which base class is being subclassed]
   Exclusions:  [a brief description of the specific code points that
      are excluded or of the properties based on which characters are
      excluded, e.g., "Eight legacy characters in the ASCII range" or
      "Any character that has a compatibility equivalent, i.e., the
      HasCompat category"]
   Specification:  [a pointer to relevant documentation, such as an RFC
      or Internet-Draft]

   In order to request a review, the registrant shall send a completed
   template to the precis@ietf.org list or its designated successor.

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   Factors to focus on while reviewing subclass registrations include
   the following:

   o  Is the problem well-defined?
   o  Is it clear what applications will use this subclass?
   o  Would an existing base class or subclass solve the problem?
   o  Are the defined exclusions a reasonable solution to the problem
      for the relevant applications?
   o  Is the subclass clearly defined?
   o  Does the subclass reduce the degree to which human users could be
      surprised by application behavior (the "principle of least user
      surprise")?
   o  Is the subclass based on an appropriate dividing line between user
      interface (culture, context, intent, locale, device limitations,
      etc.) and the use of conformant strings in protocol elements?
   o  Does the subclass introduce any new security concerns (e.g., false
      positives for authentication or authorization)?

10.4.  PRECIS Usage Registry

   IANA is requested to create a registry of application protocols that
   use the base string classes.  The registry will include one entry for
   each use (e.g., if a protocol uses both the NameClass and the
   FreeClass then the specification for that protocol would submit two
   registrations).  In accordance with [RFC5226], the registration
   policy is "Expert Review".  This policy was chosen in order to ensure
   that "customers" of PRECIS receive appropriate guidance regarding the
   sometimes complex and subtle internationalization issues related to
   use of PRECIS base classes.

   The registration template is as follows:

   Applicability:  [the specific protocol elements to which this usage
      applies, e.g., "Localparts in XMPP addresses."]
   Base Class:  [the base string class that is being used or subclassed]
   Subclass:  [whether the protocol has defined a subclass of the base
      class and, if so, the name of the subclass, e.g., "Yes,
      LocalpartNameClass."]
   Replaces:  [the Stringprep profile that this PRECIS usage replaces,
      if any]
   Normalization:  [which Unicode normalization form is applied, e.g.,
      "NFC"]
   Casemapping:  [the behavioral rule for handling of case, e.g., "Map
      uppercase and titlecase characters to lowercase."]

Internet-Draft              PRECIS Framework              September 2012


   Additional Mappings:  [any additional mappings are required or
      recommended, e.g., "Map non-ASCII space characters to ASCII
      space."]
   Directionality:  [the behavioral rule for handling of right-to-left
      code points, e.g., "The 'Bidi Rule' defined in RFC 5893 applies."]
   Specification:  [a pointer to relevant documentation, such as an RFC
      or Internet-Draft]

   In order to request a review, the registrant shall send a completed
   template to the precis@ietf.org list or its designated successor.

   Factors to focus on while reviewing usage registrations include the
   following:

   o  Does the specification define what kinds of applications are
      involved and the protocol elements to which this usage applies?
   o  Is there a base class or subclass that would be more appropriate
      to use?
   o  Are the normalization, casemapping, additional mapping, and
      directionality rules appropriate for the intended use?
   o  Does the usage reduce the degree to which human users could be
      surprised by application behavior (the "principle of least user
      surprise")?
   o  Is the usage based on an appropriate dividing line between user
      interface (culture, context, intent, locale, device limitations,
      etc.) and the use of conformant strings in protocol elements?
   o  Does the usage introduce any new security concerns (e.g., false
      positives for authentication or authorization)?


11.  Interoperability Considerations

   Although strings that are consumed in PRECIS-based application
   protocols are often encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629], the exact encoding
   is a matter for the application protocol that reuses PRECIS, not for
   the PRECIS framework.

   It is known that some existing systems are unable to support the full
   Unicode character set, or even any characters outside the ASCII
   range.  If two (or more) applications need to interoperate when
   exchanging data (e.g., for the purpose of authenticating a username
   or password), they will naturally need have in common at least one
   coded character set (as defined by [RFC6365]).  Establishing such a
   baseline is a matter for the application protocol that reuses PRECIS,
   not for the PRECIS framework.

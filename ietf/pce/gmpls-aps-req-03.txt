1. Introduction 

   The initial effort of PCE WG is focused on solving the path 
   computation problem over different domains in MPLS networks. As the 
   same case with MPLS, service providers (SPs) have also come up with 
   requirements for path computation in GMPLS networks such as photonics, 
   TDM-based or Ethernet-based networks as well. 

   [PCE-ARCH] and [PCECP-REQ] discuss the framework and requirements for 
   PCE on both packet MPLS networks and (non-packet switch capable) 
   GMPLS networks. This document complements these documents by 
   providing some consideration of GMPLS applications in the intra-
   domain and inter-domain networking environments and indicating a set 
   of requirements for the extended definition of series of PCE related 
   protocols. 

   Constraint based shortest path first (CSPF) computation within a 
   domain or over domains for signaling GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) 
   is more stringent than that of MPLS LSPs [MPLS-AS], because the 
   additional constraints, e.g., interface switching capability, link 
   encoding, link protection capability and so forth need to be 
   considered to establish GMPLS LSPs [CSPF]. GMPLS signaling protocol 
   [RFC3471, RFC3473] is designed taking into account bi-directionality,

   switching type, encoding type, SRLG, and protection attributes of the 
   TE links spanned by the path, as well as LSP encoding and switching 
   type for the end points, appropriately. 

   This document provides the investigated results of GMPLS applications 
   of PCE for the support of GMPLS path computation. This document also 
   provides requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in the GMPLS 
   intra-domain and inter-domain environments.

3. GMPLS applications of PCE 

3.1. GMPLS network model 

   Figure 1 depicts a typical network, consisting of several GMPLS 
   domains, assumed in this document. D1, D2, D3 and D4 have multiple 
   GMPLS inter-domain connections, and D5 has only one GMPLS inter-
   domain connection. These domains follow the definition in [RFC4726].

   Each domain is configured using various switching and link 
   technologies defined in [Arch] and an end-to-end route needs to 
   respect TE link attributes like switching capability, encoding type, 
   etc., making the problem a bit different from the case of classical 
   (packet) MPLS. In order to route from one GMPLS domain to another 
   GMPLS domain appropriately, each domain manages traffic engineering 
   database (TED) by PCE, and exchanges or provides route information of 
   paths, while concealing its internal topology information.

3.2. Path computation in GMPLS network 

   [CSPF] describes consideration of GMPLS TE attributes during path 
   computation.

               Figure 2: Path computation in GMPLS networks. 
 
   For the simplicity in consideration, the below basic assumptions are 
   made when the LSP is created. 

   (1) Switching capabilities of outgoing links from the ingress and 
   egress nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure 2) must be consistent 
   with each other. 

   (2) Switching capabilities of all transit links including incoming 
   links to the ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) should be 
   consistent with switching type of a LSP to be created. 

   (3) Encoding-types of all transit links should be consistent with 
   encoding type of a LSP to be created. 

   [CSPF] indicates the possible table of switching capability, encoding 
   type and bandwidth at the ingress link, transiting links and the 
   egress link which need to be satisfied with the created LSP. 

   The non-packet GMPLS networks (e.g., TDM networks) are usually 
   responsible for transmitting data for the client layer. These GMPLS 
   networks can provide different types of connections for customer 
   services based on different service bandwidth requests.  

   The applications and the corresponding additional requirements for 
   applying PCE in non-packet networks, for example, GMPLS-based TDM 
   networks, are described in Figure 3. In order to simplify the 
   description, this document just discusses the scenario in SDH 
   networks as an example. The scenarios in SONET or G.709 ODUk layer 
   networks are similar.

                      Figure 3: A simple SDH network 
                                      
   Figure 3 shows a simple network topology, where N1, N2, N3, N4, and 
   N5 are all SDH switches. Assume that one Ethernet service with 100M 
   bandwidth is required from A1 to A2 over this network. The client 
   Ethernet service could be provided by a VC4 connection from N1 to N4, 
   and it could also be provided by three concatenated VC3 connections 
   (Contiguous or Virtual concatenation) from N1 to N4.  

   The type of connection(s) (one VC4 or three concatenated VC3) that is 
   required needs to be specified by PCC (e.g., N1 or NMS), but could 
   also be determined by PCE automatically based on policy [RFC5394]. 

   Therefore, the signal type, the type of the concatenation and the 
   number of the concatenation should also be considered during path 
   computation for PCE. 

3.3. Unnumbered Interface 

   GMPLS support unnumbered interface ID that is defined in [RFC 3477], 
   which means that the endpoints of the path may be unnumbered. It 
   should also be possible to request a Path between a numbered link and 
   an unnumbered link, or a P2MP path between different types of 
   endpoints. Therefore, the PCC should be capable of indicating the 
   unnumbered interface ID of the endpoints in the PCReq message.

3.4. Asymmetric Bandwidth Path Computation  

   As per [RFC 5467], GMPLS signaling can be used for setting up an 
   asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP. If a PCE is responsible for 
   the path computation, the PCE should be capable of computing a path 
   for the bidirectional LSP with asymmetric bandwidth. It means that 
   the PCC should be able to indicate the asymmetric bandwidth 
   requirements in forward and reverse directions in the PCReq message.  

4. Requirements for GMPLS application of PCE 

   In this section, we describe requirements for GMPLS applications of 
   PCE in order to establish GMPLS LSP. 

4.1. Requirements of Path Computation Request  

   As for path computation in GMPLS networks as discussed in section 3, 
   the PCE needs to consider the GMPLS TE attributes appropriately 
   according to tables in [CSPF] once a PCC or another PCE requests a 
   path computation. Indeed, the path calculation request message from 
   the PCC or the PCE needs to contain the information specifying 
   appropriate attributes. Additional attributes to those already 
   defined in [PCECP] are as follows. 

   (1) Switching capability: PSC1-4, L2SC, DCSC [DCSC-Ext], 802_1 PBB-TE 
   [GMPLS-PBB-TE], TDM, LSC, FSC 

   (2) Encoding type: as defined in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], e.g., Ethernet, 
   SONET/SDH, Lambda, etc. 

   (3) Signal Type: Indicates the type of elementary signal that        
   constitutes the requested LSP. A lot of signal types with        
   different granularity have been defined in SONET/SDH and G.709 ODUk, 
   such as VC11, VC12, VC2, VC3 and VC4 in SDH, and ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 
   in G.709 ODUk. See [RFC4606] and [RFC4328]. 

   (4) Concatenation Type: In SDH/SONET and G.709 ODUk networks, two 
   kinds of concatenation modes are defined: contiguous     
   concatenation which requires co-route for each member signal and 
   requires all the interfaces along the path to support this capability, 
   and virtual concatenation which allows diverse routes for the member 
   signals and only requires the ingress and egress interfaces to 
   support this capability. Note that for the virtual concatenation, it 
   also may specify co-routed or separated-routed. See [RFC4606] and 
   [RFC4328] about Concatenation information.

Internet Draft        Reqs for GMPLS apps of PCE           October 2010 


   (5) Concatenation Number: Indicates the number of signals that are 
   requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated. Also see 
   [RFC4606] and [RFC4328]. 

   (6) Wavelength Label: as defined in [Lambda-label]. 

   (7) e2e Path protection type: as defined in [RFC4872], e.g., 1+1 
   protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc. 

   (8) Administrative group: as defined in [RFC3630]. 

   (9) Link Protection type: as defined in [RFC4203]. 

   (10)Support for unnumbered interfaces: as defined in [RFC3477]. 

   (11)Support for asymmetric bandwidth request: as defined in [RFC 
   5467]. 

4.2. Requirements of Path Computation Reply 

   As described above, a PCC needs to support to initiate a PCReq 
   message specifying above mentioned attributes. The PCE needs to 
   compute the path that satisfies the constraints which are specified 
   in the PCReq message. Then the PCE needs to send a PCRep message 
   including the computation result to the PCC. For Path Computation 
   Reply message (PCRep) in GMPLS networks, there are some additional 
   requirements. The PCEP PCRep message needs to be extended to meet the 
   following requirements.  

   (1) Concatenation path computation  

   In the case of concatenation path computation, when a PCE receives 
   the PCReq message specifying the concatenation constraints described 
   in section 4.1, the PCE should compute the path which satisfies the 
   specified concatenation constraints.  

   For contiguous concatenation path computation, the routes of each 
   member signal must be co-routed and all the interfaces along the 
   route should support contiguous concatenation capability. Therefore, 
   the PCE needs to compute a path based on the contiguous concatenation 
   capability of each interface and only one ERO which carries the route 
   information is needed for the response.  

   For virtual concatenation path computation, only the ingress/egress 
   interfaces need to support virtual concatenation capability and maybe 
   there are diverse routes for the different member signals. Therefore, 
   multiple EROs may be needed for the response. Each ERO may represent 
   the route of one or multiple member signals. In the case that one ERO

Internet Draft        Reqs for GMPLS apps of PCE           October 2010 


   represents several member signals among the total member signals, the 
   number of member signals along the route of the ERO needs to be 
   specified.  

   (2) Wavelength label  

   In the case that a PCC doesn't specify the wavelength when requesting 
   a wavelength path and the PCE is capable of performing the route and 
   wavelength computation procedure, the PCE needs to be able to specify 
   the wavelength of the path in a PCRep message.  

   (3) Roles of the routes  

   When a PCC specifies the protection type of the LSPs, the PCE needs 
   to compute the working route and the corresponding protection 
   route(s). Therefore, the PCRep should be capable of indicate which 
   one is working or protection route.  

4.3. GMPLS PCE Management 

   PCE related Management Information Bases need to consider extensions 
   to be satisfied with requirements for GMPLS applications. For 
   extensions, [GMPLS-TEMIB] are defined to manage TE database and may 
   be referred to accommodate GMPLS TE attributes in the PCE. 

5. Security consideration 

   PCE extensions to support GMPLS should be considered under the same 
   security as current work. This extension will not change the 
   underlying security issues. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Abstract

   Point-to-point Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
   MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may
   be established using signaling techniques, but their paths may first
   need to be determined.  The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been
   identified as an appropriate technology for the determination of the
   paths of P2MP TE LSPs.

   This document describes extensions to the PCE communication Protocol
   (PCEP) to handle requests and responses for the computation of paths
   for P2MP TE LSPs.

1. Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   [RFC4875] describes how to set up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) for use in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.

   The PCE has been identified as a suitable application for the 
   computation of paths for P2MP TE LSPs [PCE-P2MP-APP].

   The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication
   protocol between PCCs and PCEs for point-to-point (P2P) path
   computations and is defined in [RFC5440].  However, that 
   specification does not provide a mechanism to request path 
   computation of P2MP TE LSPs.

   This document presents extensions to PCEP to support P2MP path
   computation satisfying the set of requirements described in [PCE-
   P2MP-REQ].

   This document relies on the mechanisms of PCEP for requesting path
   computation for P2MP TE LSPs.  A P2MP LSP is comprised of multiple
   source-to-leaf (S2L) sub-LSPs.  These S2L sub-LSPs are set up between
   ingress and egress LSRs and are appropriately combined by the branch
   LSRs using computation results from the PCE to determine the path of 
   a P2MP TE LSP.
   
   One request message from a PCC may signal one or more S2L sub-LSP
   path computation requests to the PCE for a single P2MP LSP with
   certain constraints.  Hence the S2L sub-LSPs belonging to a P2MP LSP
   can use one path computation request message or be split across
   multiple path computation messages.

   R13: Capabilities Exchange.

   The following additional requirements have also been identified:

   R14: The PCC should be able to request a PCE to compute secondary 
   P2MP path tree with partial path diversity for specific leaves or a
   specific S2L sub-path.

   R15: Sender of the request message can specify if the return result
   from the PCE need to be represented in the compressed format or not.


3. Protocol Procedures and Extensions

   The following section describe the protocol extensions required to 
   satisfy the requirements specified in the requirements section 
   (section 2).

3.1. P2MP Capability Advertisement

3.1.1. Extend the TLV in the Existing PCE Discovery Protocol

   Since [RFC5088] has specified that we cannot add an additional
   sub-TLV to the PCEP TLV, we will define s new bit to go in the 
   existing 32 bit PCE capabilities flags to indicate the capability 
   of P2MP computation.

3.1.2. Open Message Extension

   Based on the Capabilities Exchange requirement described in [PCE-
   P2MP-REQ], if a PCE does not advertise its P2MP capability during
   discovery and the PCC does not have an alternative PCE capable of 
   P2MP computation. We need to use PCEP to allow a PCC to discover 
   which PCEs with which it communicates support P2MP path 
   computation.  To satisfy this requirement, we extend the OPEN 
   object format by including a new defined TLV for the capability of 
   P2MP in the optional field.  The new defined capability TLV allows 
   the PCE to advertise its P2MP path computation capability.

   The TLV type number will be assigned by IANA, the LENGTH value is 2
   bytes.  The value field is set to default value 0.

   Note that the capability TLV is meaningful only for a PCE so it will
   typically appear only in one of the two Open messages during PCE
   session establishment.  However, in case of PCE cooperation (e.g.,
   inter-domain), when a PCE behaving as a PCC initiates a PCE session
   it SHOULD also indicate its path computation capabilities.

3.2. P2MP LSPs Efficient Presentation

   When specifying additional leaves, or optimizing existing P2MP TE 
   LSPs as specified in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], we need to pass existing 
   P2MP LSP route information between the PCC and PCE in the request and 
   reply message. In each of these scenarios, we need new path 
   objects for efficiently passing the existing P2MP LSP between 
   the PCE and PCC.

   We specify the use of the Explicit Route Object (ERO) 
   to encode the explicit route of a TE LSP through the network. The 
   Secondary Explicit Route object (SERO) is used to specify the 
   explicit route of a S2L sub-LSP. The Reported Route Object (RRO) and 
   Secondary Reported Route Object (SERO) are used to report
   the routes of existing TE LSP for which a reoptimization is 
   desired.

   The format and contents of the ERO and RRO are defined in [RFC5440]. 
   The format and contents of the SERO and SRRO are defined in 
   [RFC4875]. A new class and type are requested for SERO and SRRO in 
   the IANA Considerations section of this document.  
   
3.3. P2MP Path Computation Request/Reply Message Extensions

   The existing P2P RP object is extended so that it can signal to the
   receiver of the PCEP request that it is for P2P or P2MP path 
   computation.  Also the END-POINT object is extended to improve the 
   efficiency of the message exchange between PCC and PCE in the case 
   of P2MP path computation.

3.3.1. The Extension of RP Object

   The PCE path computation request and reply message will need the 
   following additional parameter to allow a receiving PCE to 
   identify that the request and reply message has been fragmented 
   across multiple messages, is for a P2MP path and to specify if the 
   route is represented in the compressed format or not.

   The F bit is added to the flag bits of the RP object to indicate 
   to the receiver that the request is a fragmented request, or is not 
   fragmented request.
      
   The M bit is added in the flag bits field of the RP object to signal
   the receiver of the message that the request/reply is for P2MP or
   not.

   The E bit is added in the flag bits field of the RP object to signal
   the receiver of the message that the route is in the compress format
   or not.

   The extended format of the RP object body to include the F bit, M 
   bit and the E bit is as follows:

   The following flags are added in this draft:

   o  M ( P2MP bit - 1 bit):

         0: This indicates that this is not PCReq/PCRrep for P2MP.

         1: This indicates that this is PCReq or PCRep message for P2MP.

   o  E ( ERO-compression bit - 1 bit):

         0: This indicates that the route is not in the compressed
         format.

         1: This indicates that the route is in the compressed format.

   o  F ( RP fragmentation bit - 1 bit):

         0: This indicates that the RP is not fragmented or it is the 
            last piece of the fragmented RP.

         1: This indicates that the RP is fragmented and this is not 
            the last piece of the fragmented RP and the receiver 
            need to wait until it receives an RP with the same RP-ID 
            and with the F bit is set to 0.

3.3.2. The New P2MP END-POINTS Object

   To represent the end points for a P2MP path efficiently, we define a
   new type of end-points object for P2MP path.

   With this new END-POINTS object, the PCE path computation request
   message is expanded in a way such that it allows a single request
   message to list multiple destinations.

   There are 4 types of leaves in a P2MP request:

   o  New leaves to add;
   o  Old leaves to remove;
   o  Old leaves whose path can be modified/reoptimized;
   o  Old leaves whose path must be left unchanged.

   A given END-POINTS object gathers the leaves of a given type.  The
   type of leaf in a given END-POINTS object is identified by the END-
   POINTS object leaf type field.

   So four values are possible for the leaf type field:

   1.  New leaves to add;
   2.  Old leaves to remove;
   3.  Old leaves whose path can be modified/reoptimized;
   4.  Old leaves whose path must be left unchanged.

   With this new END-POINTS object, the END-POINTS portions of a request
   message for the multiple destinations can be roughly reduced up to
   50% for a P2MP path where a single source address has a very large
   number of destinations.

   Note that A P2MP path computation request can mix the different type
   of leaves by including several END-POINTS object per RP object as
   shown in PCReq Routing Backus-Naur Format (RBNF) [RFC5511] format in 
   next section.

   The format of the new END-POINTS object body for IPv4 (Object-Type 3)
   is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                          Leaf type                            |

3.5. Reply Message Formats

   As per [RFC5511] the RBNF format of the PCRep message is as follows.  
   Please see Appendix A for a full set of RBNF fragments defined in 
   this document and the necessary code license.
   
   Below is the message format for the reply message:

   The optional END-POINTS in the reply message is used to specify which
   paths are removed, changed, not changed, or added for the request.
   The path is only needed for the end points which are added or
   changed.

   If the ERO-Compress bit was set to 1 in request then the path will be
   formed by an ERO followed by a list of SERO.  Otherwise it is a list
   of ERO.

   Note we preserve compatibility with the [RFC5440] definition of 
   <response> and the optional <end-point-pair-list> and <path>.

3.6. P2MP Objective Functions and Metric Types

3.6.1. New Object Functions

   Six objective functions have been defined in [RFC5541] for P2P path
   computation.

   This document defines two additional objective functions, namely SPT
   (Shortest Path Tree) and MCT (Minimum Cost Tree) that apply to P2MP
   path computation.  Hence two new objective function codes have to be
   defined.

   The description of the two new objective functions is as follows.

   Objective Function Code: 7 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA)

   Name: Shortest Path Tree (SPT)

   Description: Minimize the maximum source-to-leaf cost with respect to
   a specific metric or to the TE metric used as the default metric when
   the metric is not specified. (e.g.  TE or IGP metric)

   Objective Function Code: 8 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA)

   Name: Minimum Cost Tree (MCT)

   Description: Minimize the total cost of the tree, that is the sum of
   the costs of tree links, with respect to a specific metric or to the
   TE metric used as the default metric when the metric is not   
   specified.

   Processing these two new objective functions is subject to the rules
   defined in [RFC5541].

draft-ietf-pce-pcep-p2mp-extensions-04.txt                  August 2009


3.6.2.   New Metric Object Types

   There are three types defined for the <METRIC> object in [RFC5440],
   namely, the IGP metric, the TE metric and the Hop Count metric.  This
   document defines three other types for the <METRIC> object: the P2MP
   IGP metric, the P2MP TE metric, and the P2MP Hop Count metric.  They
   encode the sum of the metrics of all links of the tree.  We propose
   the following values for these new metric types:

   o  P2MP IGP metric: T=8 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA)

   o  P2MP TE metric: T=9 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA)

   o  P2MP hop count metric: T=10 (suggested value, to be assigned by
      IANA)

3.7.  Non-Support of P2MP Path Computation.

   o  If a PCE receives a P2MP path request and it understands the P2MP
      flag in RP object, but the PCE is not capable of P2MP computation,
      the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object and 
      corresponding Error-Value.  The original P2MP path 
      computation request MUST then be cancelled. New Error-Types and 
      Error-Values are requested in the IANA Considerations section of 
      this document.

   o  If the PCE does not understand the P2MP flag in the RP object,
      then the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a new error type
      "Unknown RP flag".


3.8.  Non-Support by Back-Level PCE Implementations.

   If a PCC inadvertently sends the P2MP request to a PCE which does not
   support the PCEP P2MP extensions, then it SHOULD reject the request
   because it cannot understand the new P2MP END-POINTS object.


3.9.  P2MP TE Path Re-optimization Request

   The re-optimization request for a P2MP TE path is specified by R bit
   in the RP object similarly to the re-optimization request for a P2P
   TE path.  The only difference is that the user must insert the list
   of RRO and SRRO after each type of END-POINTS as described in the 
   PCReq message format section.

   So the PCReq message would look like this:

           Common Header
           RP with P2MP flag/R bits set
           END-POINTS for leaf type 3
             RRO list
           OF (optional)
           
            Figure 6: PCReq Message Example 1 for Optimization

   In this example, we request re-optimization of path to all leaves
   without adding or pruning leaves.  That is only one END-POINT of type
   3.  The RRO list is representing the P2MP LSP before the optimization
   and the modifiable path leaves are indicated in the END-POINTS
   object.

   Optionally it is possible to specify some leaves whose path cannot be
   modified.  The PCReq message would then look like this:

           Common Header
           RP with P2MP flag/R bits set
           END-POINTS for leaf type 3
             RRO list
           END-POINTS for leaf type 4
             RRO list
           OF (optional)

            Figure 7: PCReq Message Example 2 for Optimization

3.10.  Adding/pruning Leaves

   When adding new leaves or removing old leaves to the existing P2MP
   tree, by supplying a list of existing leaves, one may be able to
   optimize the new P2MP tree.  This section explains ways to add new
   leaves or remove old leaves to the existing P2MP tree.

   To add new leaves the user must build a P2MP request with an END-
   POINTS with leaf type 1.

   To remove old leaves the user must build a P2MP request with an END-
   POINTS with leaf type 2.

   In any case it must also provide the list of old leaves and indicate
   if they must be reoptimized or not by including END-POINTS with leaf
   type 3 or 4 or both.  This document also define error values when the 
   condition is not satisfied (i.e., when there is no END-POINTS with 
   leaf type 3 or 4, in the presence of END-POINTS with leaf type 1 
   or 2). This are documented in the IANA Considerations section. 


Zhao, et al.            Expires February, 2010                 [Page 14]

draft-ietf-pce-pcep-p2mp-extensions-04.txt                  August 2009


   For old leaves the user must provide the old path as list of RROs
   that immediately follows each END-POINTS object. This document 
   specifies error values when specific conditions are not satisfied.

   The following cases are possible when modifying an existing P2MP 
   LSP:

   Case 1: Adding leaves with full reoptimization of existing paths

3.11. Branch Nodes

   Before computing the P2MP path, a PCE must be provided means to know
   which nodes in the network are capable of acting as branch LSRs.  A
   PCE can discover such capabilities by using the mechanisms defined in
   [PCE-P2MP-REQ].

3.12. Synchronization of P2MP TE Path Computation Requests

   There are cases when multiple P2MP LSPs' computations need to be
   synchronized.  For example, one P2MP LSP is the designated backup of 
   another P2MP LSP.  In this case,  path diversity for these two 
   LSPs may need to be considered during the path computation.

   The synchronization can be done by just using the existing SVEC
   functionality.




Zhao, et al.            Expires February, 2010                 [Page 17]

   Example of synchronizing two P2MP LSPs, each has two leaves for Path
   Computation Request Messages is illustrated as below:

           Common Header
           SVEC for sync of LSP1 and LSP2
           OF (optional)
           END-POINTS1 for P2MP
            RRO1 list
           END-POINTS2 for P2MP
            RRO2 list
           
           Figure 17: PCReq Message Example for Synchronization

   We propose that two new flags are also added to the SVEC object for
   P2MP path dependent computation requests. The first new flag is to 
   allow the PCC to request that the PCE should compute a secondary 
   P2MP path tree with partial path diversity for specific leaves or 
   a specific S2L sub-path to the primary P2MP path tree. The second 
   flag, would allow the PCC to request that partial paths should be

  The following flags are added to the SVEC object body in this draft:

   o  P ( Partial Path Diversity bit - 1 bit):

         When set this would indicate a request for partial path 
         diversity for a specific leave or set of leaves. 

   o  D ( Link Direction Diverse bit - 1 bit):

        When set this would indicate a request that a partial path or 
        paths should be link direction diverse.

3.13. Request and Response Fragmentation

   In certain scenarios the request may not fit into a single request or 
   response message. For example, if a tree has many hundreds or 
   thousands of leaves. Then the request or response may need to 
   be fragmented into multiple messages.   
   
   The F bit has been outlined in section 3.3.1. The Extension of RP 
   Object, of this document. The F bit is used in the RP object header 
   to signal that the an initial request or response was too large to 
   fit into a single message and should therefore be fragmented into 
   multiple requests. In order to indentify the single request or 
   response, each message will use the same request ID.

3.13.1 Request Fragmentation Procedure 

   If the initial request is too large to fit into a single request 
   message the PCC will split the requst over multiple messages. Each 
   message sent to the PCE will have the F bit set in the RP object 
   to signify that the request has been fragmented into multiple 
   messages. In order to indentify that a series of request messages 
   represents a single request, each message will use the same    
   request ID. 
   
   The assumption is that request messages are reliably delivered 
   and in sequence since PCEP relies on TCP. 

3.13.2 Response Fragmentation Procedure

   Once the PCE computes a path based on the initial request a 
   response is sent back to the PCC. If the response is too large to fit 
   into a single response message the PCE will split the request over 
   multiple messages. Each message sent to the PCE with the F bit set 
   in the RP object to signify that the response has been fragmented 
   into multiple messages. In order to indentify that a series of 
   response messages represents a single request, each message will 
   use the same request ID.                          

   The assumption is that response messages are reliably delivered 
   and in sequence since PCEP relies on TCP.  


3.13.3 Fragmentation Examples
  
  The following example illustrates the request message with Req-ID1, 
  which adds one leaf to a 1200 leaves existing tree, is sent to the 
  PCE. The assumption is that the one request message can hold up to 
  800 leaves. In these conditions, the original one message needs to be 
  sent over by two small messages, which have the Req-ID1 specified in 
  the RP object and F bit set for the first message.

           END-POINTS1 for P2MP
            RRO1 list

  To handle the case that the last fragmented message piece is lost, the 
  receiver side of the fragmented message may start a timer once it 
  receives the first piece of the fragmented message. When timer expires
  and it still doesn't receive the last piece of the fragmented message, 
  it should send an error message to the receiver to signal that it 
  have received an incomplete message.

3.14. UNREACH-DESTINATION Object

   The PCE path computation request may fail because all or a subset of
   the destinations are unreachable.

   In such a case, the UNREACH-DESTINATION object allows the PCE to
   optionally specify the list of unreachable destinations.

   This object can be present in PCRep messages.  There can be up to one
   such object per RP.

   UNREACH-DESTINATION Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA.
   UNREACH-DESTINATION Object-Type for IPv4 is to be assigned by IANA
   UNREACH-DESTINATION Object-Type for IPv6 is to be assigned by IANA.

   Type=1) is as follows:

3.15. P2MP PCEP Error Objects and Types

   To indicate errors associated with the P2MP path request, a new
   Error-Type (16) and subsequent error-values are defined as follows
   for inclusion in the PCEP-ERROR object:

   Error-Type=16 and Error-Value=1: if a PCE receives a P2MP path
   request and the PCE is not capable to satisfy the request due to
   insufficient memory, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a PCEP
   ERROR object (Error-Type=16) and an Error-Value(Error-Value=1).  The
   corresponding P2MP path computation request MUST be cancelled.

   Error-Type=16; Error-Value=2: if a PCE receives a P2MP path request
   and the PCE is not capable of P2MP computation, the PCE MUST send a
   PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object (Error-Type=16) and an Error-
   Value (Error-Value=2).  The corresponding P2MP path computation
   request MUST be cancelled.

draft-ietf-pce-pcep-p2mp-extensions-04.txt                  August 2009


   To indicate an error associated with policy violation, a new error
   value "P2MP Path computation not allowed" should be added to an
   existing error code for policy violation (Error-Type=5) as defined 
   in [RFC5440]:

   Error-Type=5; Error-Value=6: if a PCE receives a P2MP path
   computation request which is not compliant with administrative
   privileges (i.e., "The PCE policy does not support P2MP path
   computation"), the PCE sends a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object
   (Error-Type=5) and an Error-Value (Error-Value=6).  The corresponding
   P2MP path computation request MUST be cancelled.

3.16. PCEP NO-PATH Indicator

   To communicate the reason(s) for not being able to find P2MP path
   computation, the NO-PATH object can be used in the PCRep message.
   The format of the NO-PATH object body is as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3

             Figure 22:  The Format of the NO-PATH Object Body

   One new bit flags is defined in the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carried in
   the NO-PATH Object:

   0x20: when set, the PCE indicates that there is a reachability
   problem with all or a subset of the P2MP destinations.  Optionally
   the PCE can specify the list of destination(s) that are not reachable
   using the new UNREACH-DESTINATION object defined in section 3.6.


4. Manageability Considerations

   [PCE-P2MP-REQ] describes various manageability requirements in
   support of P2MP path computation when applying PCEP.  This section
   describes how manageability requirements mentioned in [PCE-P2MP-REQ]
   are supported in the context of PCEP extensions specified in this
   document.

   Note that [RFC5440] describes various manageability considerations in
   PCEP, and most of manageability requirements mentioned in [PCE-P2MP
   P2MP] are already covered there.

4.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to configuration parameters listed in [RFC5440], the
   following parameters MAY be required.

   o  P2MP path computations enabled or disabled.

   o  Advertisement of P2MP path computation capability enabled or
      disabled (discovery protocol, capability exchange).


4.2. Information and Data Models

   As described in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], MIB objects MUST be supported for
   PCEP extensions specified in this document.

4.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   There are no additional considerations beyond those expressed in
   [RFC5440], since [PCE-P2MP-REQ] does not address any additional
   requirements.

4.4.  Verifying Correct Operation

   There are no additional considerations beyond those expressed in
   [RFC5440], since [PCE-P2MP-REQ] does not address any additional
   requirements.

4.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   As described in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], the PCE MUST obtain information
   about the P2MP signaling and branching capabilities of each LSR in
   the network.

   Protocol extensions specified in this document does not provide such
   capability.  Other mechanisms MUST be present.

4.6. Impact on Network Operation

   It is expected that use of PCEP extensions specified in this document
   does not have significant impact on network operations.

5. Security Considerations

   As described in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], P2MP path computation requests are
   more CPU-intensive and also use more link bandwidth.  Therefore, it
   may be more vulnerable to denial of service attacks. Therefore it is 
   more important that implementations conform to security requirements 
   of [RFC5440], and the implementor utilize those security features

6. IANA Considerations

   A number of IANA considerations have been highlighted in previous
   sections of this document. In summary, IANA is requested to make 
   allocations for the following PCEP parameters. 

6.1 P2MP Capability TLV

   The new defined P2MP capability TLV allows the PCE to advertise 
   its P2MP path computation capability. The LENGTH value is 2
   bytes.  The value field is set to default value 0.
   
6.2 Object Functions

   Objective Function Code: 7 (suggested value)
   Name: Shortest Path Tree (SPT)

   Objective Function Code: 8 (suggested value)
   Name: Minimum Cost Tree (MCT)

6.3 Metric Object Types

   P2MP IGP metric: T=8 (suggested value)
   P2MP TE metric: T=9 (suggested value)
   P2MP hop count metric: T=10 (suggested value)

6.4 UNREACH_DESTINATION Objects

   UNREACH_DESTINATION Object-Class 
   UNREACH_DESTINATION Object-Type for IPv4
   UNREACH_DESTINATION Object-Type for IPv6 

6.5 P2MP PCEP Error Objects and Types

   To indicate errors associated with the P2MP path request, one new 
   Error-Type 5 Error-Value and two new Error-Types (16) and 
   subsequent error-values will need to be defined and included in 
   the PCEP-ERROR object:

   Error-Type=5; Error-Value=6: To indicate an error associated with 
   policy violation, a new error value "P2MP Path computation is not 
   allowed".

   Error-Type=16 and Error-Value=1: The PCE is not capable to satisfy
   the request due to insufficient memory.

   Error-Type=16 and Error-Value=2: The PCE is not capable of P2MP 
   computations.
   
   Additionally a new Error-Type and corresponding values will be needed 
   to report reoptimization requests that fail due to END-POINT 
   leaf type failures. These are:
   
   Error-Type=17 and Error-Value=1: The PCE is not capable to satisfy
   the request due to no END-POINTS with leaf type 2.

   Error-Type=17 and Error-Value=2: The PCE is not capable to satisfy
   the request due to no END-POINTS with leaf type 3. 

   Error-Type=17 and Error-Value=2: The PCE is not capable to satisfy
   the request due to no END-POINTS with leaf type 4. 
   
6.6 SERO and SRO Object-Class

   SERO Object-Class is 25 (suggested value)

   SERO Object-Type is 1 (suggested value).

   SSRO Object-Class is 26 (suggested value).

   SSRO Object-Type is 1 (suggested value).

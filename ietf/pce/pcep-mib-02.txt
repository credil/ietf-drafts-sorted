1. Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path

   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol 
   between a PCC and PCE for point-to-point (P2P) path computations and 
   is defined in [RFC5440]. Such PCEP communication interactions include
   path computation requests and path computation replies as well as
   notifications of specific states related to the use of a PCE in the
   context of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering. 
   
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. In particular, it defines a MIB module that can be
   used to manage PCEP communications between a PCC and a PCE, or 
   between two PCEs.


2. Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is built on notions introduced
   and discussed in PCE WG documents.  The reader should be familiar
   with these documents.

   Domain:
      any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
      address management or path computational responsibility.

   IGP Area:
      OSPF Area or ISIS level.

   This document also uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655]
   and [RFC5440].


3. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7
   of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
   generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This
   memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which
   is described in STD 58,RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
   [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

4. PCEP MIB Module Architecture

   The PCEP MIB will contain the following information:
   
   a. PCEP client configuration and status.
   b. PCEP peer configuration and information.
   c. PCEP session configuration and information.
   d. Notifications to indicate PCEP session changes.

4.1. Relations to other MIB modules
        
   PCEP relies on existing protocols which have specialized MIB
   objects to monitor their own activities.  Consequently this document
   considers that the monitoring underlying protocols are out of scope 
   of the PCEP MIB module.


5. Example of the PCEP MIB module usage

   In this section we provide an example of using the MIB objects
   described in Section 6. (Object definitions) to monitor. While
   this example is not meant to illustrate every permutation of the
   MIB, it is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key
   concepts. It is meant to be read after going through the MIB
   itself.
   
   In the PCE-PCEP-DRAFT-MIB module:
   {
         pcePcepClientPcepId               (1d.1d.1d.1d:1d:1d)
         pcePcepClientIndex                (10)
         pcePcepClientAdminStatus          enable(1),
         pcePcepClientTcpPort              (4189),
         pcePcepClientKeepAliveTimer       (10),
         pcePcepClientStorageType          permanent(4),
         pcePcepClientDeadTimer            (40),
         pcePcepClientInitSession          true (1),
         pcePcepClientPoliciesAllowed      independentSyncPathComp(2),                  
   }


6.  Object Definitions

6.1 PCE-PCEP-DRAFT-MIB

   This MIB module makes references to the following documents.
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC3411], [RFC2863], [RFC4001],
   [RFC4265] and [RFC3813].

        Changes from -00- draft :
         1. Clarified the notion of PCEP Client.
         2. Added new objects to the PCEP client and session tables
            to manage PCEP protocol as in section 8 of 
            draft-ietf-pce-pcep-08.txt
         3. Did not add all the objects to manage the recommendations
            in draft-ietf-pce-pcep-08.txt to control the complexity of
            the MIB."

7. Security Considerations

   This MIB module can be used for configuration of certain objects,
   and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured,
   with potentially disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   
   o pcePcepClientTcpPort: A PCC or PCE listening in on the wrong TCO 
   port would mean PCEP communications would fail.    
   
   o pcePcepClientKeepAliveTimer: Changing the PCEP session keepalive
   timer to a value lower than the default value, may force premature
   PCEP communication time-outs. 
   
   o pcePcepClientStorageType: Changing this value may cause persitance
   failure for the configuration. 
      
   o pcePcepClientRowStatus:  Setting row status incorrectly may turn 
   off the PCEP client.
      
   o pcePcepClientDeadTimer: Changing the PCEP session deadtimer timer 
   to a value lower than the default value, may force premature PCEP
   communication time-outs. 

PCE Working Group              Expires Jan 2011                [Page 22]

draft-ietf-pce-pcep-mib-02.txt                                 July 2010

   
   o pcepPcepClientInitSession: Setting this value incorrectly may cause
   the PCEP session not to come up. 
   
    o pcePcepClientPoliciesAllowed: Setting this value incorrectly may 
    cause specific PCE requests to fail.
   
   The user of the PCE-PCEP-DRAFT-MIB module must therefore be aware 
   that support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  

   The readable objects in the PCE-PCEP-DRAFT-MIB module (i.e., those 
   with MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
   sensitive in some environments since, collectively, they provide 
   information about the amount and frequency of path computation 
   requests and responses within the network and can reveal some 
   aspects of their configuration.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.
   
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.   


8. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment for pceStdMIB under
   the mib-2 branch. The MIB module in this document uses the following
   IANA-assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers
   registry:

   IANA is requested to root MIB objects in the MIB module contained in
   this document under the mib-2 subtree.

1. Introduction 

   The initial effort of PCE WG is focused on solving the path 
   computation problem within a domain or over different domains in 
   MPLS networks. As the same case with MPLS, service providers (SPs) 
   have also come up with requirements for path computation in GMPLS 
   networks such as wavelength, TDM-based or Ethernet-based networks as 
   well. 

   [RFC4655] and [RFC4657] discuss the framework and requirements for 
   PCE on both packet MPLS networks and (non-packet switch capable) 
   GMPLS networks. This document complements these documents by 
   providing some considerations of GMPLS applications in the intra-
   domain and inter-domain networking environments and indicating a set 
   of requirements for the extended definition of series of PCE related 
   protocols.

   Note that the requirements for inter-layer traffic engineering 
   described in [RFC6457] are outside of the scope of this document. 

   Constraint based shortest path first (CSPF) computation within a 
   domain or over domains for signaling GMPLS Label Switched Paths 
   (LSPs) is more stringent than that of MPLS TE LSPs [RFC4216], 
   because the additional constraints, e.g., interface switching 
   capability, link encoding, link protection capability and so forth 
   need to be considered to establish GMPLS LSPs [CSPF]. GMPLS 
   signaling protocol [RFC3471, RFC3473] is designed taking into 
   account bi-directionality, switching type, encoding type, SRLG, and 
   protection attributes of the TE links spanned by the path, as well 
   as LSP encoding and switching type for the end points, appropriately. 

   This document provides the investigated results of GMPLS 
   applications of PCE for the support of GMPLS path computation. This 
   document also provides requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in 
   GMPLS intra-domain and inter-domain environments.

3.1. GMPLS network model  

   Figure 1 depicts a typical network, consisting of several GMPLS 
   domains, assumed in this document. D1, D2, D3 and D4 have multiple 
   inter-domain links, while D5 has only one inter-domain link. These 
   domains follow the definition in [RFC4726].

   Each domain is configured using various switching and link 
   technologies defined in [RFC3945] and an end-to-end route needs to 
   respect TE link attributes like switching capability, encoding type, 
   etc., making the problem a bit different from the case of classical 
   (packet) MPLS. In order to route from one GMPLS domain to another 
   GMPLS domain appropriately, each domain manages traffic engineering 
   database (TED) by PCE, and exchanges or provides route information 
   of paths, while concealing its internal topology information. 

3.2. Path computation in GMPLS network  

   [CSPF] describes consideration of GMPLS TE attributes during path 
   computation. Figure 2 depicts a typical GMPLS network, consisting of 
   an ingress link, a transit link as well as an egress link, to 
   investigate a consistent guideline for GMPLS path computation. Each 
   link at each interface has its own switching capability, encoding 
   type and bandwidth.

               Figure 2: Path computation in GMPLS networks. 
    
   For the simplicity in consideration, the below basic assumptions are 
   made when the LSP is created. 

   (1) Switching capabilities of outgoing links from the ingress and 
   egress nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure 2) must be consistent 
   with each other. 

   (2) Switching capabilities of all transit links including incoming 
   links to the ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) should 
   be consistent with switching type of a LSP to be created. 

   (3) Encoding-types of all transit links should be consistent with 
   encoding type of a LSP to be created. 

   [CSPF] indicates the possible tables of switching capability, 
   encoding type and bandwidth at the ingress link, transiting links 
   and the egress link which need to be satisfied with GMPLS path 
   computation of the created LSP.

   The non-packet GMPLS networks (e.g., GMPLS-based TDM networks) are 
   usually responsible for transmitting data for the client layer. 
   These GMPLS networks can provide different types of connections for 
   customer services based on different service bandwidth requests. 

   The applications and the corresponding additional requirements for 
   applying PCE to non-packet networks, for example, GMPLS-based TDM 
   networks, are described in Figure 3. In order to simplify the 
   description, this document just discusses the scenario in SDH 
   networks as an example. The scenarios in SONET or G.709 ODUk layer 
   networks are similar to this scenario.

                      Figure 3: A simple TDM(SDH) network 
    
   Figure 3 shows a simple TDM(SDH) network topology, where N1, N2, N3, 
   N4 and N5 are all SDH switches. Assume that one Ethernet service 
   with 100M bandwidth is required from A1 to A2 over this network. The 
   client Ethernet service could be provided by a VC4 connection from 
   N1 to N4, and it could also be provided by three concatenated VC3 
   connections (Contiguous or Virtual concatenation) from N1 to N4.

Internet Drafts       Reqs for GMPLS apps of PCE              June 2012 
    

   In this scenario, when the ingress node (e.g., N1) receives a client 
   service transmitting request, the type of connections (one VC4 or 
   three concatenated VC3) could be determined by PCC (e.g., N1 or NMS), 
   but could also be determined by PCE automatically based on policy 
   [RFC5394]. If it is determined by PCC, PCC should be capable of 
   specifying the ingress node and egress node, signal type, the type 
   of the concatenation and the number of the concatenation in a PCReq 
   message. PCE should consider those parameters during path 
   computation. The route information (co-route or separated-route) 
   should be specified in a PCRep message if path computation is 
   performed successfully. 

3.3. Unnumbered Interfaces 

   GMPLS supports unnumbered interface ID that is defined in [RFC 3477], 
   which means that the endpoints of the path may be unnumbered. It 
   should also be possible to request a path consisting of the mixture 
   of numbered links and unnumbered links, or a P2MP path with 
   different types of endpoints. Therefore, the PCC should be capable 
   of indicating the unnumbered interface ID of the endpoints in the 
   PCReq message. 

3.4. Asymmetric Bandwidth Path Computation 

   As per [RFC6387], GMPLS signaling can be used for setting up an 
   asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP. If a PCE is responsible for 
   the path computation, the PCE should be capable of computing a path 
   for the bidirectional LSP with asymmetric bandwidth. It means that 
   the PCC should be able to indicate the asymmetric bandwidth 
   requirements in forward and reverse directions in the PCReq message. 

4. Requirements for GMPLS application of PCE  

   In this section, we describe requirements for GMPLS applications of 
   PCE in order to establish GMPLS LSP. 

4.1. Requirements of Path Computation Request  

   As for path computation in GMPLS networks as discussed in section 3, 
   the PCE should consider the GMPLS TE attributes appropriately 
   according to tables in [CSPF] once a PCC or another PCE requests a 
   path computation. Indeed, the path calculation request message from 
   the PCC or the PCE must contain the information specifying 
   appropriate attributes. According to [RFC5440],[PCEP-EXT],[ PCE-
   WSON-REQ] and to RSVP procedures like explicit label 
   control(ELC),the additional attributes introduced are as follows: 
   [RFC5440]

   (1) Switching capability: PSC1-4, L2SC, DCSC [RFC6002], 802_1 PBB-TE 
   [RFC6060], TDM, LSC, FSC 

   (2) Encoding type: as defined in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], e.g., 
   Ethernet, SONET/SDH, Lambda, etc. 

   (3) Signal Type: Indicates the type of elementary signal that 
   constitutes the requested LSP. A lot of signal types with different 
   granularity have been defined in SONET/SDH and G.709 ODUk, such as 
   VC11, VC12, VC2, VC3 and VC4 in SDH, and ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 in 
   G.709 ODUk. See[RFC4606] , [RFC4328]and [OSPF-G709] or [RSVP-TE-
   G709]. 

   (4) Concatenation Type: In SDH/SONET and G.709 ODUk networks, two 
   kinds of concatenation modes are defined: contiguous concatenation 
   which requires co-route for each member signal and requires all the 
   interfaces along the path to support this capability, and virtual 
   concatenation which allows diverse routes for the member signals and 
   only requires the ingress and egress interfaces to support this 
   capability. Note that for the virtual concatenation, it also may 
   specify co-routed or separated-routed. See [RFC4606] and [RFC4328] 
   about concatenation information. 

   (5) Concatenation Number: Indicates the number of signals that are 
   requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated. Also see 
   [RFC4606] and [RFC4328]. 

   (6) Technology specific label(s) such as wavelength label as defined 
   in [RFC6205], or labels defined in [RFC4606], [RFC6060] or [RFC6002]. 

   (7) e2e Path protection type: as defined in [RFC4872], e.g., 1+1 
   protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc.

4.2. Requirements of Path Computation Reply  

   As described above, a PCC must support to initiate a PCReq message 
   specifying above mentioned attributes. The PCE should compute the 
   path that satisfies the constraints which are specified in the PCReq 
   message. Then the PCE should send a PCRep message including the 
   computation result to the PCC. For Path Computation Reply message 
   (PCRep) in GMPLS networks, there are some additional requirements. 
   The PCEP PCRep message must be extended to meet the following 
   requirements. 

   (1) Concatenation path computation 

   In the case of concatenation path computation, when a PCE receives 
   the PCReq message specifying the concatenation constraints described 
   in section 4.1, the PCE should compute the path which satisfies the 
   specified concatenation constraints. 

   For contiguous concatenation path computation, the routes of each 
   member signal must be co-routed and all the interfaces along the 
   route should support contiguous concatenation capability. Therefore, 
   the PCE should compute a path based on the contiguous concatenation 
   capability of each interface and only one ERO which should carry the 
   route information for the response. 

   For virtual concatenation path computation, only the ingress/egress 
   interfaces need to support virtual concatenation capability and 
   maybe there are diverse routes for the different member signals. 
   Therefore, multiple EROs may be needed for the response. Each ERO 
   may represent the route of one or multiple member signals. In the 
   case that one ERO represents several member signals among the total 
   member signals, the number of member signals along the route of the 
   ERO must be specified. 

    (2) Label constraint 

   In the case that a PCC doesn't specify the label when requesting a 
   label-resctricted path and the PCE is capable of performing the 
   route and label assignment computation procedure, the PCE needs to 
   be able to specify the label of the path in a PCRep message. 

   Wavelength restriction is a typical case of label restriction but is 
   only one instance of it. More generally in GMPLS networks label 
   switching and selection constraint may apply and a PCC may request a 
   PCE to take label constraint into account and return an ERO 
   containing the labels or set of label that fulfill the PCC request.

Internet Drafts       Reqs for GMPLS apps of PCE              June 2012 
    

   The PCReq aspects are covered in section 4.1 in the requirements 6, 
   12 and 13. 

   (3) Roles of the routes 

   When a PCC specifies the protection type of an LSP, the PCE should 
   compute the working route and the corresponding protection route(s). 
   Therefore, the PCRep should be capable of indicating which one is 
   working or protection route.  

4.3. GMPLS PCE Management 

   PCE related Management Information Bases must consider extensions to 
   be satisfied with requirements for GMPLS applications. For 
   extensions, [RFC4802] are defined to manage TE database and may be 
   referred to accommodate GMPLS TE attributes in the PCE. 

5. Security consideration  

   PCE extensions to support GMPLS should be considered under the same 
   security as current PCE work. This extension will not change the 
   underlying security issues.  

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document has no actions for IANA.

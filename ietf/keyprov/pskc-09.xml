		<abstract>
			<t>This document specifies a symmetric key format for transport and provisioning of
				symmetric keys to different types of crypto modules. For example, One Time Password (OTP) shared secrets or symmetric
				cryptographic keys to strong authentication devices. A standard key transport format enables enterprises to
				deploy best-of-breed solutions combining components from different vendors into the
				same infrastructure. </t>
		</abstract>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>With increasing use of symmetric key based systems, such as encryption of data at rest, or systems used for strong authentication, such as those
				based on one-time-password (OTP) and challenge response (CR) mechanisms, there is a need for
				vendor interoperability and a standard format for importing and exporting
				(provisioning) symmetric keys. For instance, traditionally, vendors of authentication servers and
				service providers have used proprietary formats for importing and exporting these
				keys into their systems, thus making it hard to use tokens from two different vendors.</t>
			<t>This document defines a standardized XML-based key container, called Portable
				Symmetric Key Container (PSKC), for transporting symmetric keys and key related meta data. The document also specifies the information elements that are required when the symmetric key is utilized for specific purposes, such as the initial counter in the HMAC-Based One Time Password (HOTP)  <xref target="HOTP"/> algorithm. It also requests the creation of an IANA registry for algorithm profiles where algorithms, their meta-data and PSKC transmission profile can be recorded for centralised standardised reference. </t>
				
				
				<section title="Key Words">
					<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
						NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
						described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
				</section>				
				
				<section title="Version Support" anchor="VersionSupport">
					<t>There is a provision made in the syntax for an explicit version
   number.  Only version "1.0" is currently specified.</t>
				   <t>   The numbering scheme for PSKC versions is
   "&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;". The major and minor numbers MUST be treated as
   separate integers and each number MAY be incremented higher than a
   single digit. Thus, "PSKC 2.4" would be a lower version than "PSKC
   2.13", which in turn would be lower than "PSKC 12.3".  Leading zeros
   (e.g., "PSKC 6.01") MUST be ignored by recipients and MUST NOT be
   sent.
				   </t>
				   <t>The major version number should be incremented only if the message 
   format (E.g. Element structure)  has changed so dramatically that
   an older version implementation would not be able to interoperate with a
   newer version.  The minor version number indicates new capabilities,
   and MUST be ignored by an entity with a smaller minor version number,
   but used for informational purposes by the entity with the larger
   minor version number.

				<t>The following attributes of the &lt;Key&gt; element MUST be included at a
					minimum: <list style="hanging">
						<t hangText="'Id':">This attribute carries a unique identifier
							for the symmetric key in the context of key provisioning exchanges between two parties. This means that if PSKC is used in multiple interactions between a sending and receiving party, using different containers referencing the same keys, the KeyId MUST use the same KeyId values (e.g. after initial provisioning, if a system wants to update key meta data values in the other system the KeyId value of the key where the meta data is to be updates MUST be the same of the original KeyId value provisioned).

								<t hangText="&lt;TimeDrift&gt;:">This element contains the
									device clock drift value for time-based OTP algorithms. The
									integer value (positive or negative drift) that indicates the number of time intervals that a validation server has established the device clock drifted after the last succssful authentication. So for example if the last successful authentication established a device time value of 8 intervals from a specific start date but the validation server determines the time value at 9 intervals, the server SHOULD record the drift as -1.</t>

				<t>Two parties receiving the same key value OCTET STRING, resulting in decoding the xs:base64Binary, inside the &lt;PlainValue&gt; or &lt;EncryptedValue&gt; elements, must make use of the key in exactly the same way in order to interoperate.  To ensure that, it is necessary to define a correspondence between the OCTET STRING and the notation in the standard algorithm description that defines how the key is used. 
The next sections establish that correspondence for the algorithms AES <xref target="FIPS197"/> and  TDEA <xref target="SP800-67"/>. Unless otherwise specified for a specific algorithm the OCTET STRING encoding MUST follow the AES Key Value Encoding.
				</t>
				<section title="AES Key Value Encoding">
				<t><xref target="FIPS197"/> section 5.2, titled Key Expansion, uses the input key as an array of bytes indexed starting at 0.  The first octet of OCTET STRING SHALL become the key byte in AES labeled index 0 in <xref target="FIPS197"/>; the succeeding octets of OCTET STRING SHALL become key bytes in AES in increasing index order.
				</t>
				<t>Proper parsing and key load of the contents of OCTET STRING for AES SHALL be determined by using the following value for the &lt;PlainValue&gt; element (binaryBase64 encoded) to generate and match the key expansion test vectors in <xref target="FIPS197"/> Appendix A for AES

			<section title="Triple DES Key Value Encoding">
				<t>A Triple-DES key consists of three keys for the cryptographic engine (Key1, Key2, and Key3) that are each 64 bits (56 key bits and 8 parity bits); the three keys are also collectively referred to as a key bundle <xref target="SP800-67"/>.  A key bundle may employ either two or three independent keys.  When only two independent keys are employed (called  two-key Triple DES), then the same value is used for Key1 and Key3.
				</t>
				<t>Each key in a Triple-DES key bundle is expanded into a key schedule according to a procedure defined in  <xref target="SP800-67"/> Appendix A.  That procedure numbers the bits in the key from 1 to 64, with number 1  being the left-most, or most significant bit (MSB).  The first octet of OCTET STRING SHALL be bits 1 through 8 of Key1 with bit 1 being the MSB. The second octet of OCTET STRING SHALL be bits 9 through 16 of Key1, and so forth, so that the trailing octet of OCTET STRING SHALL be bits 57 through 64 of Key3 (or Key2 for two-key Triple DES).
				</t>
				<t>Proper parsing and key load of the contents of OCTET STRING for Triple-DES  SHALL be determined by using the following &lt;PlainValue&gt; element (binaryBase64 encoded)  to generate and match the key expansion test vectors in <xref target="SP800-67"/> appendix B for the key bundle:

					title="&lt;DeviceInfo&gt; Element: Unique Device Identification">
					<t>The &lt;DeviceInfo&gt; element uniquely identifies the device the
						&lt;KeyPackage&gt; is provisioned to. Since devices can come in different
						form factors, such as hardware tokens, smart-cards, soft tokens in a mobile
						phone or as a PC, this element allows different child element combinations to be used.
						When combined, the values of the child elements MUST uniquely identify the device. For example,
						for hardware tokens the combination of &lt;SerialNo&gt; and
						&lt;Manufacturer&gt; elements uniquely identifies a device but the
						&lt;SerialNo&gt; element alone is insufficient since two different
						token manufacturers might issue devices with the same serial number (similar
						to the Issuer Distinguished Name and serial number of a certificate). </t>

					<t>The &lt;DeviceInfo&gt; element has the following child elements:
							<list style="hanging">
							<t hangText="&lt;Manufacturer&gt;:">This element indicates the
								manufacturer of the device. Values for Manufacturer MUST be taken from either <xref target="OATHMAN"/>  prefixes (i.e., the left column) or from IANA Private Enterprise Number Registry <xref target="IANAPENREG"/>, using the Organisation value. When the value is taken from  <xref target="OATHMAN"/> "oath." MUST be prepended to the value (e.g. "oath.&lt;prefix value from <xref target="OATHMAN"/>&gt;"). When the value is taken from <xref target="IANAPENREG"/> "iana." MUST be prepended to the value (e.g. "iana.&lt;Organisation value from <xref target="IANAPENREG"/>&gt;").</t>
							<t hangText="&lt;SerialNo&gt;:">This element contains the serial
								number of the device.</t>
							<t hangText="&lt;Model&gt;:">This element describes the model of
								the device (e.g., one-button-HOTP-token-V1).</t>
							<t hangText="&lt;IssueNo&gt;:">This element contains the issue
								number in case devices with the same serial number that are
								distinguished by different issue numbers.</t>
							<t hangText="&lt;DeviceBinding&gt;:">This element allows a provisioning server to ensure that the key is
    going to be loaded into the device for which the key provisioning
    request was approved. The device is bound to the request using a device
    identifier, e.g., an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) for the phone, or an identifier for a class of
    identifiers, e.g., those for which the keys are protected by a  Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
</t>
							<t hangText="&lt;StartDate&gt;: and &lt;ExpiryDate&gt;:"

								resolution finer than milliseconds and MUST NOT generate time
								instants that specify leap seconds. Keys that reside on the device SHOULD only be used when the current date is after the &lt;StartDate&gt; and before the &lt;ExpiryDate&gt;. Note that usage enforcement of the keys with respective to the dates MAY only happen on the validation server as some devices such as smart cards do not have an internal clock. Systems thus SHOULD NOT rely upon the device to enforce key usage date restrictions.</t>

			<section title="Transmission of Key Derivation Values">
				<t>&lt;KeyProfileId> element, which is a child element of the
					&lt;Key&gt; element, carries a unique identifier used between the
					sending and receiving parties to establish a set of key attribute values that are
					not transmitted within the container but agreed between the two parties out of
					band. This element will then represent the unique reference to a set of
					key attribute values. (For example, a smart card application personalisation profile
					id related to specific attribute values present on a smart card application, that have influence
					when computing a response.).</t>
				<t>For example, in the case of MasterCard's Chip Authentication Program 
						<xref target="CAP"/>, the sending and the receiving party would agree that KeyProfileId='1' represents a certain set of values (e.g., Internet Authentication Flag IAF set to a specific value). During transmission of the KeyContainer, these values would not be transmitted as key
					attributes but only referred to via the &lt;KeyProfileId&gt; element set
					to the specific agreed profile (in this case '1'). The receiving party
					can then associate all relevant key attributes contained in
					the out of band agreed profile with the imported keys. Often this methodology is
					used between a manufacturing service, run by company A and the validation service run by company B, to avoid repeated transmission
					of the same set of key attribute values.</t>
				<t>The &lt;KeyReference> element contains a reference to an external key to be used with a
					key derivation scheme and no specific key value (secret) is transported but only the
					reference to the external master key is used (e.g., the PKCS#11 key label).</t>

		<section anchor="EncryptionKeyDescription" title="Key Protection Methods">
			<t>With the functionality described in the previous sections, information related to keys
				had to be transmitted in clear text. With the help of the
				&lt;EncryptionKey&gt; element, which is a child element of the
				&lt;KeyContainer&gt; element, it is possible to encrypt keys and associated
				information. The level of encryption is applied to the value of individual elements
				and the applied encryption algorithm MUST be the same for all encrypted elements. Keys are protected using the following methods: pre-shared keys, passphrase-based
				keys, and asymmetric keys. When encryption algorithms are used that make use of Initialisation Vectors (IV), for example AES128-CBC, then a random IV value MUST be generated for each value to be encrypted and it MUST be prepended to the resulting encrypted value as specified in <xref target="XMLENC"/>.</t>
				

			<section anchor="SymmetricKeyProtectionDescription"
				title="Encryption based on Pre-Shared Keys">
				<t><xref target="example-encr-psk"/> shows an example that illustrates the
					encryption of the content of the &lt;Secret&gt; element using
					AES128-CBC and PKCS5 Padding. The plaintext value of &lt;Secret&gt; is
					'3132333435363738393031323334353637383930'. The name of the pre-shared secret is
					"Pre-shared-key", as set in the &lt;KeyName&gt; element (which is a child
					element of the &lt;EncryptionKey&gt; element). The value of the encryption key used
					is '12345678901234567890123456789012'.</t>
					<t> The IV for the MAC key is '11223344556677889900112233445566' and the IV for the HOTP key is '000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f'.
					</t>

				   <t> When algorithms without integrity checks are used, such as AES-128-CBC, a keyed
					MAC value MUST be placed in the &lt;ValueMAC&gt; element of the &lt;Data&gt; element. In this
					case the MAC algorithm type MUST be set in the &lt;MACMethod&gt;

					When the sender generates such a random MAC key, the MAC key material MUST be encrypted 
					with the same encryption key specified in &lt;EncryptionKey&gt; element of the key container. The 
					encryption method and encrypted value MUST be set respectively in the &lt;EncryptionMethod&gt; element

					The &lt;MACKeyReference&gt; element of the &lt;MACMethod&gt; element MAY be used to indicate

			<section title="Encryption based on Passphrase-based Keys" anchor="PBEbasedEncryption">
				<t><xref target="example-encr-passwd"/> shows an example that illustrates the
					encryption of the content of the &lt;Secret&gt; element using
					passphrase based key derivation (PBKDF2) to derive the encryption key as defined in <xref target="PKCS5"/>. When using passphrase based key derivation, the &lt;DerivedKey&gt; element defined in XML Encryption v1.1 <xref target="XMLENC11"/> MUST be used to specify the passphrased-based 
				key. A &lt;DerivedKey&gt; element is set as the child element of &lt;EncryptionKey&gt; element of the key container.</t>
				<t>
				The &lt;DerivedKey&gt; element is used to specify the key derivation function and related parameters. 
				The encryption algorithm, in this example AES-128-CBC ( URI 'http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes128-cbc'),  MUST be set in the 'Algorithm' attribute of &lt;EncryptionMethod&gt; element used inside the encrypted data elements.</t>
				
			   <t>When PBKDF2 is used, the  'Algorithm' attribute of the &lt;xenc11:KeyDerivationMethod&gt; element MUST be set to the URI 'http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/pkcs/schemas/pkcs-5#pbkdf2'. The  
			   &lt;xenc11:KeyDerivationMethod&gt; element MUST include the &lt;PBKDF2-params> child element to indicate the 
			   PBKDF2 parameters, such as salt and iteration count.</t>
			

              <t>When the encryption method uses a CBC mode that uses an explicit initialization vector (IV) other than a
              derived one, the IV MUST be passed by prepending it to the encrypted value.</t>
					
				<t>In the example below, the following data is used. <list style="hanging">
						<t hangText="Password:       ">qwerty</t>
						<t hangText="Salt:                 ">0x123eff3c4a72129c</t>
						<t hangText="Iteration Count:">1000</t>
						<t hangText="MAC Key:        ">0xbdaab8d648e850d25a3289364f7d7eaaf53ce581</t>
						<t hangText="OTP Secret:     ">12345678901234567890</t>
					</list> The derived encryption key is "0x651e63cd57008476af1ff6422cd02e41". The initialization
					vector (IV) is "0xa13be8f92db69ec992d99fd1b5ca05f0". This key is also used to encrypt the randomly 
					chosen MAC key. A different IV can be used, say, "0xd864d39cbc0cdc8e1ee483b9164b9fa0" in the example. 
					The encryption with algorithm "AES-128-CBC" follows the specification defined in <xref target="XMLENC"/>. </t>

		<section anchor="bulk" title="Bulk Provisioning">
			<t>The functionality of bulk provisioning can be accomplished by repeating the
				&lt;KeyPackage&gt; element multiple times within the
				&lt;KeyContainer&gt; element indicating that multiple keys are provided to
				different devices or cryptomodules. The &lt;EncryptionKey&gt; element then applies to all
				&lt;KeyPackage&gt; elements. When provisioning multiple keys to the same device the &lt;KeyPackage&gt; element is repeated but the enclosed &lt;DeviceInfo&gt; element will contain the same sub-elements that uniquely identify the single device (for example the keys for the device identified by SerialNo='9999999' in the example below).</t>

						of this document then a new version number has to be allocated to refer to
						the new specification version. The version number is carried inside the
						'Version' attribute, as described in <xref target="basics"/>, the numbering scheme MUST follow <xref target="VersionSupport"/>, and rules
						for extensibililty are defined in <xref target="iana"/>.</t>
					<t hangText="New XML Elements:">The usage of the XML schema and the available
						extension points allows new XML elements to be added. Depending of type of
						XML elements different ways for extensibility are offered. In some places

					<t hangText="New PSKC Algorithm Profiles:">This document defines two PSKC

						profiles can be registered as described in <xref
							target="SymmetricKeyAlgorithmIdentifierRegistry"/>.</t>
					<t hangText="Algorithm URIs:">
						<xref target="EncryptionKeyDescription"/> defines how keys and related data
						can be protected. A number of algorithms can be used. The use of new
						algorithms can be used by pointing to a new algorithm URI. </t>
					<t hangText="Policy:">
						<xref target="policy"/> defines policies that can be attached to a key and
						keying related data. The &lt;Policy&gt; element is one such item

		<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="SecurityConsiderations">
			<t>The portable symmetric key container (PSKC) carries sensitive information (e.g., cryptographic keys)
				and may be transported across the boundaries of one secure perimeter to another. For
				example, a container residing within the secure perimeter of a back-end provisioning
				server in a secure room may be transported across the internet to an end-user device
				attached to a personal computer. This means that special care MUST be taken to
				ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the information contained
				within.</t>
			<section title="PSKC Confidentiality">
				<t>By design, the container allows two main approaches to guaranteeing the
					confidentiality of the information it contains while transported. </t>
				<t>First, the container key data payload may be encrypted.</t>
				<t>In this case no transport layer security is required. However, standard security
					best practices apply when selecting the strength of the cryptographic algorithm
					for key data payload encryption. 
					Symmetric cryptographic cipher SHOULD be used - the
					longer the cryptographic key, the stronger the protection. Please see <xref target="SymmetricKeyProtectionDescription"/> for recommendations of key data payload protection using symmetric cryptographic ciphers.
					 In cases where the exchange of key encryption keys
					between the sender and the receiver is not possible, asymmetric encryption of
					the key data payload may be employed, see <xref target="AsymmetricKeyProtectionDescription"/> . Similarly to symmetric key cryptography,
					the stronger the asymmetric key, the more secure the protection is. </t>
				<t>If the key data payload is encrypted with a method that uses one of the password-based
					encryption methods (PBE methods) detailed in <xref target="PBEbasedEncryption"/>, the key data payload may be subjected to password
					dictionary attacks to break the encryption password and recover the information.
					Standard security best practices for selection of strong encryption passwords
					apply.</t>
				<t>Additionally, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that practical implementations use PBESalt and PBEIterationCount when PBE
					encryption is used. A different PBESalt value per PSKC SHOULD be used for
					best protection.</t>
				<t>The second approach to protecting the confidentiality of the key data
  is based on using lower layer security mechanisms (e.g., <xref target="TLS"/>,
  <xref target="IPSec"/>).  The secure connection established between the source
  secure perimeter (the provisioning server from the example above) and
  the target perimeter (the device attached to the end-user computer)
  utilizes encryption to protect the messages that travel across that
  connection.  No key data payload encryption is required in this mode.
  Secure connections that encrypt and digest each message provide an
  extra measure of security.
 </t>
				<t>Because of the fact that the plain text PSKC is protected only by the
					transport layer security, practical implementation MUST ensure protection
					against man-in-the-middle attacks. Authenticating  the secure channel end-points is
					critically important for eliminating intruders that may compromise the
					confidentiality of the PSKC.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="PSKC Integrity">
				<t>The PSKC provides a mean to guarantee the integrity
					of the information it contains through digital signatures. It is RECOMMENDED that for best security	practices, the digital signature of the container encompasses the entire
					PSKC.This provides assurances for the integrity of all attributes. It also
					allows verification of the integrity of a given PSKC even after the container
					is delivered through the communication channel to the target perimeter and
					channel message integrity check is no longer possible. </t>
			</section>
			<section title="PSKC Authenticity">
				<t>The digital signature of the PSKC is the primary way of showing its
					authenticity. The recipient of the container SHOULD use the public key associated
					with the signature to assert the authenticity of the sender by tracing it back
					to a preloaded public key or certificate. Note that the digital signature of the
					PSKC can be checked even after the container has been delivered through the
					secure channel of communication.</t>
				<t>Authenticity guarantee may be provided by <xref target="TLS"/> or <xref target="IPSec"/>. However, no authenticity verification is possible once the container is delivered at the recipient end. Since the TLS endpoints could differ from the key provisioning endpoints, this solution is weaker than the previous solution that relies on a digital signature of the PSKC. </t>

		<section title="Use Cases">

			<t>This section describes a comprehensive list of use cases that inspired the
				development of this specification. These requirements were used to derive the
				primary requirement that drove the design. These requirements are covered in the
				next section.</t>
			<t>These use cases also help in understanding the applicability of this specification to
				real world situations.</t>
			<section title="Online Use Cases">

				<t>This section describes the use cases related to provisioning the keys using an
					online provisioning protocol such as <xref target="DSKPP"/>.</t>

				<section title="Transport of keys from Server to Cryptographic Module">
					<t>For example, a mobile device user wants to obtain a symmetric key for use
						with a Cryptographic Module on the device. The Cryptographic Module from
						vendor A initiates the provisioning process against a provisioning system
						from vendor B using a standards-based provisioning protocol such as <xref
							target="DSKPP"/>. The provisioning entity delivers one or more keys in a
						standard format that can be processed by the mobile device.</t>

					<t>For example, in a variation of the above, instead of the user's mobile phone,
						a key is provisioned in the user's soft token application on a laptop using
						a network-based online protocol. As before, the provisioning system delivers
						a key in a standard format that can be processed by the soft token on the
						PC.</t>

					<t>For example, the end-user or the key issuer wants to update or configure an
						existing key in the Cryptographic Module and requests a replacement key
						container. The container may or may not include a new key and may include
						new or updated key attributes such as a new counter value in HOTP key case,
						a modified response format or length, a new friendly name, etc.</t>

				</section>

				<section title="Transport of keys from Cryptographic Module to Cryptographic Module">
					<t>For example, a user wants to transport a key from one Cryptographic Module to
						another. There may be two cryptographic modules, one on a computer one on a
						mobile phone, and the user wants to transport a key from the computer to the
						mobile phone. The user can export the key and related data in a standard
						format for input into the other Cryptographic Module.</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Transport of keys from Cryptographic Module to Server">
					<t>For example, a user wants to activate and use a new key and related data
						against a validation system that is not aware of this key. This key may be
						embedded in the Cryptographic Module (e.g. SD card, USB drive) that the user
						has purchased at the local electronics retailer. Along with the
						Cryptographic Module, the user may get the key on a CD or a floppy in a
						standard format. The user can now upload via a secure online channel or
						import this key and related data into the new validation system and start
						using the key.</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Server to server Bulk import/export of keys">
					<t>From time to time, a key management system may be required to import or
						export keys in bulk from one entity to another. </t>
					<t>For example, instead of importing keys from a manufacturer using a file, a
						validation server may download the keys using an online protocol. The keys
						can be downloaded in a standard format that can be processed by a validation
						system.</t>
					<t>For example, in a variation of the above, an Over-The-Air (OTA) key
						provisioning gateway that provisions keys to mobile phones may obtain key
						material from a key issuer using an online protocol. The keys are delivered
						in a standard format that can be processed by the key provisioning gateway
						and subsequently sent to the end-user's mobile phone.</t>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section title="Offline Use Cases">
				<t>This section describes the use cases relating to offline transport of keys from
					one system to another, using some form of export and import model. </t>

				<section title="Server to server Bulk import/export of keys">
					<t>For example, Cryptographic Modules such as OTP authentication tokens, may
						have their symmetric keys initialized during the manufacturing process in
						bulk, requiring copies of the keys and algorithm data to be loaded into the
						authentication system through a file on portable media. The manufacturer
						provides the keys and related data in the form of a file containing records
						in standard format, typically on a CD. Note that the token manufacturer and
						the vendor for the validation system may be the same or different. Some
						crypto modules will allow local PIN management (the device will have a PIN
						pad) hence random initial PINs set at manufacturing should be transmitted
						together with the respective keys they protect.</t>
					<t>For example, an enterprise wants to port keys and related data from an
						existing validation system A into a different validation system B. The
						existing validation system provides the enterprise with a functionality that
						enables export of keys and related data (e.g. for OTP authentication tokens)
						in a standard format. Since the OTP tokens are in the standard format, the
						enterprise can import the token records into the new validation system B and
						start using the existing tokens. Note that the vendors for the two
						validation systems may be the same or different. </t>

				Several of the requirements were derived from use cases described above. <list
					style="format R%d:">
					<t>The format MUST support transport of multiple types of symmetric keys and
						related attributes for algorithms including HOTP, other OTP,
						challenge-response, etc.</t>
					<t>The format MUST handle the symmetric key itself as well of attributes that
						are typically associated with symmetric keys. Some of these attributes may
						be <list style="symbols">
							<t>Unique Key Identifier</t>
							<t>Issuer information</t>
							<t>Algorithm ID</t>
							<t>Algorithm mode</t>
							<t>Issuer Name</t>
							<t>Key friendly name</t>
							<t>Event counter value (moving factor for OTP algorithms)</t>
							<t>Time value</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>The format SHOULD support both offline and online scenarios. That is it
						should be serializable to a file as well as it should be possible to use
						this format in online provisioning protocols such as <xref target="DSKPP"/></t>
					<t>The format SHOULD allow bulk representation of symmetric keys</t>
					<t>The format SHOULD allow bulk representation of PINs related to specific keys</t>
					<t>The format SHOULD be portable to various platforms. Furthermore, it SHOULD be
						computationally efficient to process.</t>
					<t>The format MUST provide appropriate level of security in terms of data
						encryption and data integrity. </t>
					<t>For online scenarios the format SHOULD NOT rely on transport level security
						(e.g., SSL/TLS) for core security requirements.</t>
					<t>The format SHOULD be extensible. It SHOULD enable extension points allowing
						vendors to specify additional attributes in the future.</t>
					<t>The format SHOULD allow for distribution of key derivation data without the
						actual symmetric key itself. This is to support symmetric key management
						schemes that rely on key derivation algorithms based on a pre-placed master
						key. The key derivation data typically consists of a reference to the key,
						rather than the key value itself.</t>
					<t>The format SHOULD allow for additional lifecycle management operations such
						as counter resynchronization. Such processes require confidentiality between
						client and server, thus could use a common secure container format, without
						the transfer of key material.</t>
					<t>The format MUST support the use of pre-shared symmetric keys to ensure
						confidentiality of sensitive data elements. </t>
					<t>The format MUST support a password-based encryption (PBE) <xref
							target="PKCS5"/> scheme to ensure security of sensitive data elements.
						This is a widely used method for various provisioning scenarios.</t>
					<t>The format SHOULD support asymmetric encryption algorithms such as RSA to
						ensure end-to-end security of sensitive data elements. This is to support
						scenarios where a pre-set shared key encryption key is difficult to use.

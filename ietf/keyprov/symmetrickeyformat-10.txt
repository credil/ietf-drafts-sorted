1. Introduction 

   This document defines the symmetric key format content type.  It is 
   transport independent. The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) 
   [RFC5652] can be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or 
   encrypt this content type. 

   The use cases that motivated the attributes in this work are 
   elaborated in [PSKC].  They are omitted to avoid duplication. 

   This document also includes Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) 
   definitions of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) element and 
   attributes defined in [PSKC]. 

1.1. Requirements Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

1.2. ASN.1 Syntax Notation 

   The key package is defined using the ASN.1 [X.680], [X.681], [X.682], 
   and [X.683]. 

2. Symmetric Key Package Content Type 

   The symmetric key package content type is used to transfer one or 
   more plaintext symmetric keys from one party to another.  A symmetric 
   key package MAY be encapsulated in one or more CMS protecting content 
   types.  This content type MUST be Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) 
   encoded [X.690]. 

   The symmetric key package content type has the following syntax: 

   ct-symmetric-key-package CONTENT-TYPE ::= 
       { SymmetricKeyPackage IDENTIFIED BY id-ct-KP-sKeyPackage }

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type        August 2010 
    

     id-ct-KP-sKeyPackage OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= 
       { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 
         smime(16) ct(1) 25 } 

     SymmetricKeyPackage ::= SEQUENCE { 
       version           KeyPkgVersion DEFAULT v1, 
       sKeyPkgAttrs  [0] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute 
                                      {{ SKeyPkgAttributes }} OPTIONAL, 
       sKeys             SymmetricKeys, 
       ... } 

     SymmetricKeys ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF OneSymmetricKey 

     OneSymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE { 
       sKeyAttrs  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute 
                                      {{ SKeyAttributes }}  OPTIONAL, 
       sKey       OCTET STRING OPTIONAL } 
       ( WITH COMPONENTS { ..., sKeyAttrs PRESENT } | 
         WITH COMPONENTS { ..., sKey PRESENT } ) 

     KeyPkgVersion ::= INTEGER  { v1(1) } ( v1, ... ) 

   The SymmetricKeyPackage fields are used as follows: 

   - version identifies version of the symmetric key package content 
     structure.  For this version of the specification, the default 
     value, v1, MUST be used. 

   - sKeyPkgAttrs optionally provides attributes that apply to all of 
     the symmetric keys in the package. The SKeyPkgAttributes 
     information object set restricts the attributes allowed in 
     sKeyPkgAttrs.  If an attribute appears here, then it MUST NOT also 
     be included in sKeyAttrs. 

   - sKeys contains a sequence of OneSymmetricKey values.  This 
     structure is discussed below. 

   The OneSymmetricKey fields are used as follows: 

   - sKeyAttrs optionally provides attributes that apply to one 
      symmetric key. The SKeyAttributes information object set 
      restricts the attributes permitted in sKeyAttrs.  If an attribute 
      appears here, then it MUST NOT also be included in sKeyPkgAttrs. 

   - sKey optionally contains the key value encoded as an OCTET STRING.

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type        August 2010 
    

   The OneSymmetricKey field MUST include either sKeyAttrs, or sKey, or 
   sKeyAttrs and sKey. 

3. PSKC Attributes 

   The following attributes are defined to assist those using the 
   symmetric key package defined in this document as part of a Dynamic 
   Symmetric Key Provision Protocol (DSKPP) [DSKPP] with Portable 
   Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) attributes.  [PSKC] should be 
   consulted for the definitive attribute descriptions.  The attributes 
   fall in to three categories.  The first category includes attributes 
   that apply to a key package, and these attributes will generally 
   appear in sKeyPkgAttrs.  The second category includes attributes that 
   apply to a particular key, and these attributes will generally appear 
   in sKeyAttrs. The third category includes attributes that apply to a 
   key policy.  Of the attributes defined, only the Key Identifier 
   (Section 3.2.1) and Algorithm (Section 3.2.2) key attributes MUST be 
   included.  All other attributes are OPTIONAL.  

   Like PSKC, the Symmetric Key Content Type supports extensibility.  
   Primarily this is accomplished through the definition and inclusion 
   of new attributes, but in some instances where the attribute contains 
   more than one type the ASN.1 "..." extensibility mechanism is 
   employed. 

   A straightforward approach to conversion from XML types to ASN.1 is 
   employed.  The <xs:string> type converts to UTF8String; the XML 
   <xs:dateTime> type converts to GeneralizedTime; and the XML integer 
   types convert to INTEGER or BinaryTime [RFC4049]. 

3.1. PSKC Key Package Attributes 

   PSKC key package attributes apply to an entire key package.  These 
   attributes can be categorized by two different attribute collections: 
   device information and cryptographic module attributes.  All of these 
   key package attributes are OPTIONAL.  

3.1.1. Device Information Attributes 

   Device Information attributes when taken together MUST uniquely 
   identify a device to which the Symmetric Key Package is provisioned. 

3.1.1.1. Manufacturer 

   The Manufacturer attribute indicates the manufacturer of the device. 
   Values for Manufacturer MUST be taken from either [OATHMAN] prefixes 
   (i.e., the left column) or from IANA Private Enterprise Number 
 
 
Turner & Housley        Expires February 4, 2010               [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type        August 2010 
    

   Registry [IANAPENREG], using the Organisation value.  When the value 
   is taken from [OATHMAN] "oath." MUST be prepended to the value (e.g., 
   "oath.<values from [OATHMAN]>").  When the value is taken from 
   [IANAPENREG] "iana." MUST be prepended to the value (e.g., 
   "iana.<ORganisation value from [IANAPENREG]>").  The attribute 
   definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-manufacturer ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-manufacturer } 

   id-pskc-manufacturer OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 1 } 

3.1.1.2. Serial Number 

   The Serial Number attribute indicates the serial number of the 
   device.  The attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-serialNo ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-serialNo } 

   id-pskc-serialNo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 2 } 

3.1.1.3. Model 

   The Model attribute indicates the model of the device.  The attribute 
   definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-model ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-model } 

   id-pskc-model OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 3 } 

3.1.1.4. Issue Number 

   The Issue Number attribute contains an issue number to distinguish 
   between two devices with the same serial number.  The attribute 
   definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-issueNo ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-issueNo } 

   id-pskc-issueNo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 4 } 

3.1.1.5. Device Binding 

   The Device Binding attribute provides an opaque identifier that 
   allows keys to be bound to the device or to a class of devices.   
 
 
Turner & Housley        Expires February 4, 2010               [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type        August 2010 
    

   When loading keys into a device, the attribute's value MUST be 
   checked against information provided to the user via out-of-band 
   mechanisms.  The implementation then ensures that the correct device 
   or class of device is being used with respect to the provisioned key. 

   at-pskc-deviceBinding ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-deviceBinding } 

   id-pskc-deviceBinding OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 5 } 

3.1.1.6. Device Start Date 

   When included in sKeyPkgAttrs, the Device Start Date attribute 
   indicates the start date for a device.  The date MUST be represented 
   in a form that matches the dateTime production from [XMLSCHEMA].  The 
   date MUST be expressed in canonical form with no time zone component.  
   Implementations SHOULD NOT rely on time resolution finer than 
   milliseconds and MUST NOT generate time instants that specify leap 
   seconds.  Keys that are on the device SHOULD only be used when the 
   current date is on or after the device start date.  The attribute 
   definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-deviceStartDate ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE GeneralizedTime IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-deviceStartDate } 

   id-pskc-deviceStartDate OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 6 } 

   Note that usage enforcement of the keys with respect to the dates MAY 
   only happen on the validation server as some devices such as smart 
   cards do not have an internal clock.  Systems thus SHOULD NOT rely 
   upon the device to enforce key usage date restrictions. 

3.1.1.7. Device Expiry Date 

   When included in sKeyPkgAttrs, the Device Expiry Date attribute 
   indicates the expiry date for a device. The date MUST be represented 
   in a form that matches the dateTime production from [XMLSCHEMA].  The 
   date MUST be expressed in canonical form with no time zone component.  
   Implementations SHOULD NOT rely on time resolution finer than 
   milliseconds and MUST NOT generate time instants that specify leap 
   seconds.  Keys that are on the device SHOULD only be used when the 
   current date is before the device expiry date.  The attribute 
   definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-deviceExpiryDate ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE GeneralizedTime IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-deviceExpiryDate }

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type        August 2010 
    

   id-pskc-deviceExpiryDate OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 7 } 

   Note that usage enforcement of the keys with respect to the dates MAY 
   only happen on the validation server as some devices such as smart 
   cards do not have an internal clock.  Systems thus SHOULD NOT rely 
   upon the device to enforce key usage date restrictions. 

3.1.1.8. Device User Id 

   The Device User Id attribute indicates the user with whom the device 
   is associated with using a distinguished name, as defined in 
   [RFC4514].  For example: UID=jsmith,DC=example,DC=net. The attribute 
   definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-deviceUserId ATTRIBUTE ::= { 

     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-deviceUserId } 

   id-pskc-deviceUserId OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 26 } 

   As specified in [PSKC], there are no semantics associated with this 
   element, i.e., there are no checks enforcing that only a specific 
   user can use this device.  As such, this element is for informational 
   purposes only. 

3.1.2. Cryptographic Module Information Attributes 

   Cryptographic Module attributes uniquely identify a cryptographic 
   module.  This is useful when the device contains more than one 
   cryptographic module.  At this time only one attribute is defined. 

3.1.2.1. Cryptographic Module Identifier 

   When included in sKeyPkgAttrs, the Cryptographic Module Identifier 
   attribute uniquely identifies the cryptographic module to which the 
   key is being or was provisioned.  The attribute definition is as 
   follows: 

   at-pskc-moduleId ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-moduleId } 

   id-pskc-moduleId OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 8 }

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type        August 2010 
    

3.2. PSKC Key Attributes 

   PSKC key attributes apply to a specific key. As noted earlier, the 
   Key Identifier (Sec 3.2.1) and Algorithm (Sec 3.2.2) key attributes 
   are REQUIRED.  All other attributes are OPTIONAL. 

3.2.1. Key Identifier 

   When included in sKeyAttrs, the Key Identifier attribute identifies 
   the key in the context of key provisioning exchanges between two 
   parties. This means that if PSKC is used in multiple interactions 
   between a sending and receiving party, using different containers 
   referencing the same keys, the KeyId MUST use the same KeyId values 
   (e.g. after initial provisioning, if a system wants to update key 
   meta data values in the other system the KeyId value of the key where 
   the meta data is to be updates MUST be the same as the original KeyId 
   value provisioned). The attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-keyId ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-keyId } 

   id-pskc-keyId OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 9 } 

3.2.2. Algorithm 

   The Algorithm attribute uniquely identifies the PSKC algorithm 
   profile.  [PSKC] defines two algorithm profiles "HOTP" and "PIN".  
   The attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-algorithm ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-algorithm } 

   id-pskc-algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 10 } 

3.2.3. Issuer 

   The Issuer attribute names the entity that issued the key.  The 
   attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-issuer ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-issuer } 

   id-pskc-issuer OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 11 }

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type        August 2010 
    

3.2.4. Key Profile Identifier 

   The Key Profile Identifier attribute carries a unique identifier used 
   between the sending and receiving parties to establish a set of key 
   attribute values that are not transmitted within the container but 
   agreed between the two parties out of band.  This attribute will then 
   represent the unique reference to a set of key attribute values. 

   at-pskc-keyProfileId ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-keyProfileId } 

   id-pskc-keyProfileId OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 12 } 

3.2.5. Key Reference Identifier 

   The Key Reference attribute refers to an external key to be used with 
   a key derivation scheme and no specific key value (secret) is 
   transported but only the reference to the external master key is used 
   (e.g., the PKCS#11 key label). 

   at-pskc-keyReference ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-keyReference } 

   id-pskc-keyReference OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 13 } 

3.2.6. Friendly Name 

   The Friendly Name attribute contains a human readable name for the 
   secret key.  The attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-friendlyName ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE FriendlyName IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-friendlyName } 

   id-pskc-friendlyName OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 14 } 

   The Friendly Name attribute has the following syntax: 

   FriendlyName ::= SEQUENCE { 
     friendlyName        UTF8String, 
     friendlyNameLangTag UTF8String OPTIONAL } 

   The text is encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629], which accommodates most of 
   the world's writing systems.  The friendlyNameLangTag field 
   identifies the language used to express the friendlyName.  When 
   friendlyNameLangTag is absent, English, whose associated language tag 
   is "en", is used.  The value of the friendlyNameLangTag MUST be a 
   language tag as described in [RFC5646].

3.2.7. Algorithm Parameters 

   The Algorithm Parameters attribute contains parameters that influence 
   the result of the algorithmic computation, for example response 
   truncation and format in One-Time Password (OTP) and Challenge-
   Response (CR) algorithms.   

   at-pskc-algorithmParameters ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE PSKCAlgorithmParameters 
     IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-algorithmParams } 

   id-pskc-algorithmParams OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 15 } 

   The Algorithm Parameters attribute has the following syntax: 

   PSKCAlgorithmParameters ::= CHOICE { 
     suite                UTF8String OPTIONAL, 
     challengeFormat  [0] ChallengeFormat, 
     responseFormat   [1] ResponseFormat, 
     ... } 

   ChallengeFormat ::= SEQUENCE { 
     encoding    Encoding, 
     checkDigit  BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, 
     min         INTEGER (0..MAX), 
     max         INTEGER (0..MAX), 
     ... } 

   Encoding ::= UTF8STRING ("DECIMAL" | "HEXADECIMAL" | 
                "ALPHANUMERIC" |"BASE64" |"BINARY") 

   ResponseFormat ::= SEQUENCE { 
     encoding     Encoding, 
     length       INTEGER (0..MAX), 
     checkDigit   BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, 
     ... } 

   The fields in PSKCAlgorithmParameters have the following meanings: 

    o Suite defines additional characteristics of the algorithm used, 
      which are algorithm specific.  For example in HMAC based OTP 
      algorithm it could designate the strength of the hash algorithm 
      used (SHA1, SHA256, etc).  Please refer to algorithm profile

    o ChallengeFormat defines the characteristics of the challenge in a 
      CR usage scenario whereby the following fields are defined: 

       o encoding specifies the encoding of the challenge accepted by 
        the device and MUST be one of the following values: DECIMAL, 
        HEXADECIMAL, ALPHANUMERIC, BASE64, or BINARY.  The BASE64 
        encoding is done as in Section 4 of [RFC4648]. 

       o checkDigit indicates whether a device needs to check the 
        appended Luhn check digit, as defined in [LUHN], contained in a 
        challenge.  The checkDigit MUST NOT be present if the encoding 
        value is anything other than 'DECIMAL'.  A value of TRUE 
        indicates that the device will check the appended Luhn check 
        digit in a provided challenge.  A value of FALSE indicates that 
        the device will not check the appended Luhn check digit in the 
        challenge. 

       o min defines the minimum size of the challenge accepted by the 
        device for CR mode.  If encoding is 'DECIMAL', 'HEXADECIMAL' or 
        'ALPHANUMERIC' this value indicates the minimum number of 
        digits/characters.  If encoding is 'BASE64' or 'BINARY', this 
        value indicates the minimum number of bytes of the unencoded 
        value. 

       o max defines the maximum size of the challenge accepted by the 
        device for CR mode.  If encoding is 'DECIMAL', 'HEXADECIMAL' or 
        'ALPHANUMERIC' this value indicates the maximum number of 
        digits/characters.  If the encoding is 'BASE64' or 'BINARY', 
        this value indicates the maximum number of bytes of the 
        unencoded value. 

   o ResponseFormat defines the characteristics of the result of a 
      computation and defines the format of the OTP or the response to 
      a challenge.  For cases where the key is a personal 
      identification number (PIN) value, this element contains the 
      format of the PIN itself (e.g., DECIMAL, length 4 for a 4 digit 
      PIN).  The following fields are defined: 

       o encoding specifies the encoding of the response generated by 
        the device and MUST be one of the following values: DECIMAL, 
        HEXADECIMAL, ALPHANUMERIC, BASE64, or BINARY.  BASE64 is 
        defined as in Section 4 of [RFC4648]. 

       o length defines the length of the response generated by the 
        device.  If encoding is 'DECIMAL', 'HEXADECIMAL' or 
        'ALPHANUMERIC' this value indicates the number of

        digits/characters.  If encoding is 'BASE64' or 'BINARY', this 
        value indicates the number of bytes of the unencoded value. 

       o checkDigit indicates whether the device needs to append a Luhn 
        check digit, as defined in [LUHN], to the response.  This is 
        only valid if encoding attribute is 'DECIMAL'.  If the value is 
        TRUE then the device will append a Luhn check digit to the 
        response.  If the value is FALSE, then the device will not 
        append a Luhn check digit to the response. 

3.2.8. Counter 

   The Counter attribute contains the event counter for event-based OTP 
   algorithms.  The attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-counter ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE INTEGER(0..MAX) IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-counter } 

   id-pskc-counter OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 16 } 

3.2.9. Time 

   The Time attribute conveys the time for time-based OTP algorithms.  
   If the Time Interval attribute is included, then this element carries 
   the number of time intervals passed for a specific start point.  If 
   time interval is used, then this element carries the number of time 
   intervals passed from a specific start point, normally algorithm 
   dependent.  It uses the BinaryTime syntax from [RFC4049]. The 
   attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-time ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE BinaryTime IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-time } 

   id-pskc-time OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 17 } 

3.2.10. Time Interval 

   The Time Interval attribute conveys the time interval value for time-
   based OTP algorithms in seconds (e.g., a value of 30 for this would 
   indicate a time interval of 30 seconds). It is an integer. The 
   attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-timeInterval ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE INTEGER (0..MAX) IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-timeInterval } 

   id-pskc-timeInterval OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 18 }

3.2.11. Time Drift 

   The Time Drift attribute contains the device clock drift value for 
   time-based OTP algorithms. It is an integer either positive or 
   negative that indicates the number of time intervals that a 
   validation server has established the device clock drifted after the 
   last successful authentication. The attribute definition is as 
   follows: 

   at-pskc-timeDrift ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE INTEGER (0..MAX) IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-timeDrift } 

   id-pskc-timeDrift OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 19 } 

3.2.12. Value MAC 

   The Value MAC attribute is a Message Authentication Code (MAC) 
   generated from the encrypted value in case the encryption algorithm 
   does not support integrity checks (e.g., AES-CBC does not provide 
   integrity while AES Key Wrap with MLI does). The attribute definition 
   is as follows: 

   at-pskc-valueMAC ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE ValueMac IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-valueMAC } 

   id-pskc-valueMAC OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 20 } 

   ValueMac ::= SEQUENCE { 
     macAlgorithm UTF8String, 
     mac          UTF8String } 

   The fields in ValueMac have the following meanings: 

    o macAlgorithm identifies the MAC algorithm used to generate the 
      value placed in digest. 

    o mac is the base64 encoded, as specified in Section 4 of [RFC4648], 
      mac value. 

3.2.13. Key User Id 

   The Key User Id attribute indicates the user with whom the key is 
   associated using a distinguished name, as defined in [RFC4514].  For 
   example: UID=jsmith,DC=example,DC=net. The attribute definition is as 
   follows:

   at-pskc-keyUserId ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE UTF8String IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-keyUserId } 

   id-pskc-keyUserId OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 27 } 

   As specified in [PSKC], there are no semantics associated with this 
   element, i.e., there are no checks enforcing that only a specific 
   user can use this key.  As such, this element is for informational 
   purposes only. 

3.3. Key Policy Attributes 

   Key policy attributes indicate a policy that can be attached to a 
   key.  These attributes are defined in the subsections that follow. 

3.3.1. Key Start Date 

   When included in sKeyAttrs, the Key Start Date attribute indicates 
   the start of the key's validity period.  The date MUST be represented 
   in a form that matches the dateTime production from [XMLSCHEMA].  The 
   date MUST be expressed in canonical form with no time zone component.  
   Implementations SHOULD NOT rely on time resolution finer than 
   milliseconds and MUST NOT generate time instants that specify leap 
   seconds.  The attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-keyStartDate ATTRIBUTE ::= { 

     TYPE GeneralizedTime IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-keyStartDate } 

   id-pskc-keyStartDate OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 21 } 

3.3.2. Key Expiry Date 

   When included in sKeyAttrs, the Key Expiry Date attribute indicates 
   the end of the key's validity period.  The date MUST be represented 
   in a form that matches the dateTime production from [XMLSCHEMA].  The 
   date MUST be expressed in canonical form with no time zone component.  
   Implementations SHOULD NOT rely on time resolution finer than 
   milliseconds and MUST NOT generate time instants that specify leap 
   seconds. The attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-keyExpiryDate ATTRIBUTE ::= {

3.3.3. Number of Transactions 

   The Number of Transactions attribute indicates the maximum number of 
   times a key carried within the package can be used.  When this 
   element is omitted there is no restriction regarding the number of 
   times a key can be used. The attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-noOfTransactions ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE INTEGER (0..MAX) IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-noOfTransactions } 

   id-pskc-noOfTransactions OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 23 } 

3.3.4. Key Usage 

   The Key Usage attribute constrains the intended usage of the key.  
   The recipient MUST enforce the key usage.  The attribute definition 
   is as follows: 

   at-pskc-keyUsage ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE PSKCKeyUsages IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-keyUsages } 

   id-pskc-keyUsages OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 24 } 

   PSKCKeyUsages ::= SEQUENCE OF PSKCKeyUsage  

   PSKCKeyUsage ::= UTF8String ("OTP" | "CR" | "Encrypt" | 
                    "Integrity" | "Verify" | "Unlock" | "Decrypt" | 
                    "KeyWrap" | "Unwrap" | "Derive" | "Generate") 

   The fields in PSKCKeyUsage have the following meanings: 

    o OTP:  The key MUST only be used for OTP generation. 

    o CR:  The key MUST only be used for Challenge/Response purposes. 

    o Encrypt:  The key MUST only be used for data encryption purposes. 

    o Integrity:  The key MUST only be used to generate a keyed message 
     digest for data integrity or authentication purposes. 

    o Verify:  The key MUST only be used to verify a keyed message 
     digest for data integrity or authentication purposes (is converse 
     of Integrity). 

    o Unlock:  The key MUST only be used for an inverse challenge 
     response in the case where a user has locked the device by

     entering a wrong PIN too many times (for devices with PIN-input 
     capability). 

    o Decrypt:  The key MUST only be used for data decryption purposes. 

    o KeyWrap:  The key MUST only be used for key wrap purposes. 

    o Unwrap:  The key MUST only be used for key unwrap purposes. 

    o Derive:  The key MUST only be used with a key derivation function 
     to derive a new key (see also Section 8.2.4 of [NIST800-57]). 

    o Generate:  The key MUST only be used to generate a new key based 
     on a random number and the previous value of the key (see also 
     Section 8.1.5.2.1 of [NIST800-57]).  

3.3.5. PIN Policy 

   The PIN Policy attribute allows policy about the PIN usage to be 
   associated with the key. The attribute definition is as follows: 

   at-pskc-pinPolicy ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
     TYPE PINPolicy IDENTIFIED BY id-pskc-pinPolicy } 

   id-pskc-pinPolicy OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pskc 25 } 

   PINPolicy ::= SEQUENCE { 
     pinKeyId          [0] UTF8String OPTIONAL, 
     pinUsageMode      [1] PINUsageMode, 
     maxFailedAttempts [2] INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL, 
     minLength         [3] INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL, 
     maxLength         [4] INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL, 
     pinEncoding       [5] Encoding OPTIONAL } 

   PINUsageMode ::= UTF8String ("Local" | "Prepend" | "Append" | 
                    "Algorithmic") 

   The fields in PIN Policy have the following meanings: 

    o pinKeyId uniquely identifies the key held within this container 
     that contains the value of the PIN that protects the key. 

       o pinUsageMode indicates the way the PIN is used during the 
        usage of the key.  The following values are defined in [PSKC]: 
        Local, Prepend, Append, Algorithmic.

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type        August 2010 
    

    o maxFailedAttempts indicates the maximum number of times the PIN 
     may be entered wrongly before it MUST NOT be possible to use the 
     key anymore (reasonable values are in the positive integer range 
     of at least 2 and no more than 10). 

    o minLength indicates the minimum length of a PIN that can be set to 
     protect the associated key.  It MUST NOT be possible to set a PIN 
     shorter than this value.  If pinEncoding is 'DECIMAL', 
     'HEXADECIMAL' or 'ALPHANUMERIC' this value indicates the number of 
     digits/ characters.  If pinEncoding is 'BASE64' or 'BINARY', this 
     value indicates the number of bytes of the unencoded value. 

    o maxLength indicates the maximum length of a PIN that can be set to 
     protect this key.  It MUST NOT be possible to set a PIN longer 
     than this value.  If pinEncoding is 'DECIMAL', 'HEXADECIMAL' or 
     'ALPHANUMERIC' this value indicates the number of 
     digits/characters.  If the pinEncoding is 'BASE64' or 'BINARY', 
     this value indicates the number of bytes of the unencoded value. 

    o pinEncoding is based on Encoding, which is defined in Section 
     3.2.6, and specifies encoding of the PIN and MUST be one of the 
     following values: DECIMAL, HEXADECIMAL, ALPHANUMERIC, BASE64, or 
     BINARY. 

   If pinUsageMode is set to "Local" then the device MUST enforce the 
   restriction indicated in maxFailedAttempts, minLength, maxLength and 
   pinEncoding, otherwise it MUST be enforced on the server side. 

4. Key Encoding 

   Two parties receiving the same key as an sKey OCTET STRING must make 
   use of the key in exactly the same way in order to interoperate.  To 
   ensure that, it is necessary to define a correspondence between the 
   abstract syntax of sKey and the notation in the standard algorithm 
   description that defines how the key is used.  The next sections 
   establish that correspondence for the algorithms AES [FIPS197] and 
   TDEA [SP800-67]. 

4.1. AES Key Encoding 

   [FIPS197] section 5.2, titled Key Expansion, uses the input key as an 
   array of bytes indexed starting at 0.  The first octet of sKey SHALL 
   become the key byte in AES labeled index 0 in [FIPS197]; the 
   succeeding octets of sKey SHALL become key bytes in AES in increasing 
   index order.

Internet-Draft    Symmetric Key Package Content Type        August 2010 
    

   Proper parsing and key load of the contents of sKey for AES SHALL be 
   determined by using the following sKey octet string to generate and 
   match the key expansion test vectors in [FIPS197] Appendix A for AES 
   Cipher Key: 2b 7e 15 16 28 ae d2 a6 ab f7 15 88 09 cf 4f 3c

     04  16     2b 7e 15 16 28 ae d2 a6 ab f7 15 88 09 cf 4f 3c 

4.2. Triple DES Key Encoding 

   A Triple-DES key consists of three keys for the cryptographic engine 
   (Key1, Key2, and Key3) that are each 64 bits (56 key bits and 8 
   parity bits); the three keys are also collectively referred to as a 
   key bundle [SP800-67].  A key bundle may employ either two or three 
   independent keys.  When only two independent keys are employed 
   (called two-key Triple DES), then the same value is used for Key1 and 
   Key3. 

   Each key in a Triple-DES key bundle is expanded into a key schedule 
   according to a procedure defined in [SP800-67] Appendix A.  That 
   procedure numbers the bits in the key from 1 to 64, with number 1 
   being the left-most, or most significant bit (MSB).  The first octet 
   of sKey SHALL be bits 1 through 8 of Key1 with bit 1 being the MSB.  
   The second octet of sKey SHALL be bits 9 through 16 of Key1, and so 
   forth, so that the trailing octet of sKEY SHALL be bits 57 through 64 
   of Key3 (or Key2 for two-key Triple DES). 

   Proper parsing and key load of the contents of sKey for Triple-DES 
   SHALL be determined by using the following sKey octet string to 
   generate and match the key expansion test vectors in [SP800-67] 
   appendix B for the key bundle: 

   Key1 = 0123456789ABCDEF 

   Key2 = 23456789ABCDEF01 

   Key3 = 456789ABCDEF0123  

     Tag Length Value 
     04  24     0123456789ABCDEF 23456789ABCDEF01 456789ABCDEF0123 

5. Security Considerations 

   Implementers of this protocol are strongly encouraged to consider 
   generally accepted principles of secure key management when 
   integrating this capability within an overall security architecture.

   The symmetric key package contents are not protected.  This content 
   type can be combined with a security protocol to protect the contents 
   of the package.  One possibility is to include this content type in 
   place of a PSKC package in [DSKPP] exchanges.  In this case, the 
   algorithm requirements are found in those documents.  Another 
   possibility is to encapsulate this content type in a CMS [RFC5652] 
   protecting content type. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document makes use of object identifiers to identify a CMS 
   content type (Appendix A.1), the ASN.1 version of the PSKC attributes 
   (Appendix A.2), and the ASN.1 modules found in Appendix A.1 and A.2.  
   All OIDs are registered in an arc delegated by RSADSI to the SMIME 
   Working Group.  The current contents of the arc are located here: 

         http://www.imc.org/ietf-smime/sm-oid.asn 

   They were obtained by sending a request to 
   ietf-smime-oid-reg@imc.org.  When the SMIME WG closes, this arc and 
   registration procedures will be transferred to IANA. No further 
   action by IANA is necessary for this document or any anticipated 
   updates.

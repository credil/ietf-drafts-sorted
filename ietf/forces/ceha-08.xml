<list style="symbols">
          <t>
Logical Functional Block (LFB)  -- 
A template that represents a fine-grained, logically separate
aspects of FE processing.
</t>
          <t>
ForCES Protocol -- 
   The protocol used for communication communication between CEs and FEs. This protocol
   does not apply to CE-to-CE communication, FE-to-FE communication, or
   to communication between FE and CE managers.  The ForCES protocol is
   a master-slave protocol in which FEs are slaves and CEs are masters.
   This protocol includes both the management of the communication
   channel (e.g., connection establishment, heartbeats) and the control
   messages themselves.
</t>
          <t>
ForCES Protocol Layer (ForCES PL) -- 
   A layer in the ForCES protocol architecture that defines the ForCES
   protocol messages, the protocol state transfer scheme, and the ForCES
   protocol architecture itself (including requirements of ForCES TML as
   shown below). Specifications of ForCES PL are defined in <xref target="RFC5810"></xref>
   </t>
   
          <t>
ForCES Protocol Transport Mapping Layer (ForCES TML) -- A layer in 
ForCES protocol architecture that specifically addresses the 
protocol message transportation issues, such as how the protocol 
messages are mapped to different transport media (like SCTP, IP, 
TCP, UDP, ATM, Ethernet, etc), and how to achieve and implement 
reliability, security, etc.
</t>
<t>Forwarding Element (FE) - A logical entity that implements the ForCES
   Protocol.  FEs use the underlying hardware to provide per-packet
   processing and handling as directed by a CE via the ForCES Protocol.
   </t>

<t>Control Element (CE) - A logical entity that implements the ForCES
   Protocol and uses it to instruct one or more FEs on how to process
   packets.  CEs handle functionality such as the execution of control
   and signaling protocols.</t>
   
<t>ForCES Network Element (NE) - An entity composed of one or more CEs
   and one or more FEs.  An NE usually hides its internal organization
   from external entities and represents a single point of management to
   entities outside the NE.</t>
   
<t>FE Manager (FEM) - A logical entity that operates in the pre-association

The ForCES architecture allows FEs to be aware of multiple CEs
but enforces that only one CE be the master controller. This is known
in the industry as 1+N redundancy. The master CE controls the 
FEs via the ForCES protocol operating on the Fp interface. If the master CE
becomes faulty, a backup CE takes over and NE operation continues.
By definition, the current documented setup is known as cold-standby.
The set of CEs controlling an FE is static and is passed to the FE 
by the FE Manager (FEM) via the Ff interface and to each CE by the CE 
Manager (CEM) in the Fc interface during the pre-association phase.
</t>
      <t>
From an FE perspective, the knobs of control for a CE set are defined 
by the FEPO LFB in <xref target="RFC5810"/>, Appendix B. 
In <xref target="HAnow"/> of this document we discuss further details of these knobs.
</t>
      <section title="Document Scope" anchor="scope">
        <t>
It is assumed that the reader is aware of the ForCES architecture to
make sense of the changes being described in this document. This document 
provides background information to set the context of the discussion in 
<xref target="hsb"/>.
</t>
        <t>
At the time this document is being written, the Fr interface is out of scope 
for the ForCES architecture.  However, it is expected that organizations 
implementing a set of CEs will need to have the CEs communicate
to each other via the Fr interface in order to achieve the 
synchronization necessary for controlling the FEs.
</t>
        <t>
The problem scope addressed by this document
falls into 2 areas:
<list style="numbers">
            <t>
To update the description of <xref target="RFC5810"/> with more clarity on how
current cold-standby approach operates within the NE cluster. 
</t>
            <t>
To describe how to evolve the <xref target="RFC5810"/> cold-standby
setup to a hot-standby redundancy setup to improve the failover 
time and NE availability.
</t>
            <!-- removed from WG doc version 0

To describe a minimalist approach for Fr plane 
communication which interacting CEs MAY use for both cold and hot
standby.

        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Quantifying Problem Scope" anchor="quant">
        <t>
The NE recovery and availability is dependent on several time-sensitive
metrics:
<list style="numbers">
            <t>
       How fast the CE plane failure is detected by the FE.
       </t>
            <t>
	How fast a backup CE becomes operational.
       </t>
            <t>
	 How fast the FEs associate with the new master CE.
       </t>
            <t>
	 How fast the FEs recover their state and become operational.
       </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
The design intent of the current <xref target="RFC5810"/> as well as this
document 
to meet the above goals are driven by desire for simplicity.
</t>
        <t>
To quantify the above criteria with the current prescribed 
ForCES CE setup in <xref target="RFC5810"/>: 
<list style="numbers">
            <t>
How fast the FE side detects a CE failure is left undefined. To
illustrate an extreme scenario, we could have a human operator
acting as the monitoring entity to detect faulty CEs. How fast such
detection happens could be in the range of seconds to days. A more
active monitor on the Fr interface could improve this detection. 
<!--
In <xref target="CEsync"/> we define a behavior on Fr 
interface to detect CE failures in order to improve things.
-->
            </t>
            <t>
How fast the backup CE becomes operational is also currently out of scope.
In the current setup, a backup CE need not be operational at all
(for example, to save power) and therefore it is feasible for a 
monitoring entity to boot up a backup CE after it detects the 
failure of the master CE. In this document <xref target="hsb"/>
we suggest that at least one backup CE be online so as to improve this
metric.
</t>
            <t>
How fast an FE associates with new master CE is also currently undefined.
The cost of an FE connecting and associating adds to the recovery overhead. 
As mentioned above we suggest having at least one backup CE online.
In <xref target="hsb"/> we propose to zero out the connection and 
association cost on failover by having each FE associate with all 
online backup CEs after associating to an active/master CE.
Note that if an FE pre-associates with at least one backup CE, then 
the system will be technically operating in hot-standby mode.
</t>
            <t>
And last: How fast an FE recovers its state depends on how much NE state
exists. By ForCES current definition, the new master CE assumes zero state
on the FE and starts from scratch to update the FE. 
So the larger the state, the longer the recovery.
<!--
In <xref target="CEsync"/> we propose to improve this metric 
by having the master CE and backup CEs synchronizing in the Fr plane.

      <t>
To achieve CE High Availability (HA), FEs and CEs MUST inter-operate per 
<xref target="RFC5810"/> definition
which is repeated for contextual reasons in <xref target="HAnow"/>. 
It should be noted that in this default setup, which MUST be 
implemented by CEs and FEs requiring HA, the Fr plane is out of 
scope (and if available is proprietary to an implementation).
</t>
      <section anchor="HAnow" title="RFC 5810 CE HA Support">
        <t>
     As mentioned earlier, although there can be multiple redundant CEs,
     only one CE actively  controls FEs in a ForCES NE. In practice 
     there may be only one backup CE.
     At any moment in time, only one master CE can control an FE. 
     In addition, the
     FE connects and associates to only the master CE. The FE and the CE
     are aware of the primary and one or more secondary CEs. 
     This information (primary,
     secondary CEs) is configured on the FE and the CE  during
     pre-association by the FEM and the CEM respectively.

    The FEPO CEID component identifies the current master CE and the
    component table BackupCEs identifies the configured backup CEs.
    The FEPO FE Heartbeat Interval, CE Heartbeat Dead Interval,
    and CE Heartbeat policy help in detecting connectivity
    problems between an FE and CE. The CE Failover policy defines
    how the FE should react on a detected failure. The FEObject FEState
    component <xref target="RFC5812"/> 
    defines the operational forwarding status and control. The CE can
    turn off the FE's forwarding operations by setting the FEState to
    AdminDisable and can turn it on by setting it to OperEnable. 
    Note: <xref target="RFC5812"/> section 5.1 has an errata which

The FE connects to the CE specified on FEPO CEID component.
If it fails to connect to the defined CE, it moves it
to the bottom of table BackupCEs and sets its CEID
component to be the first CE retrieved from table BackupCEs.
The FE then attempts to associate with the CE designated as the new
primary CE. The FE continues through this procedure until it 
successfully connects to one of the CEs or until the CE Failover Timeout Interval (CEFTI) expires.

]]></artwork>

          <t>
There are several events that trigger mastership changes: The master CE
may issue a mastership change (by changing the CEID component), or teardown
an existing association; and last, connectivity may be lost between 
the CE and FE.
</t>
          <t>
When communication fails between the FE and CE (which can be caused
by either the CE or link failure but not FE related), either the TML on the
FE will trigger the FE PL regarding this failure or it will be detected
using the heartbeat messages between FEs and CEs. The communication failure,
regardless of how it is detected, MUST be considered as a loss of
association between the CE and corresponding FE.
</t>
          <t>If the FE's FEPO CE Failover Policy is configured to mode 0 
(the default), it will immediately transition to the pre-association
phase. This means that if association is later re-established with a
CE, all FE state will need to be re-created.
</t>
          <t>
      If the FE's FEPO CE Failover Policy is configured to mode 1, 
      it indicates that the FE will run in HA restart recovery.
      In such a case, the FE transitions to the Not Associated state and
      the CEFTI timer <xref target="RFC5810"/> is started. 
      The FE may continue to forward
      packets during this state depending upon the value of the CEFailoverPolicy component of the FEPO LFB.
      The FE recycles through any configured
      backup CEs in a round-robin fashion. It first adds its
      primary CE to the bottom of table BackupCEs and sets its CEID 
      component to be the first secondary retrieved from table BackupCEs. 
      The FE then attempts to associate with the CE designated as the new 
      primary CE. 
      If it fails to re-associate with any CE and the
      CEFTI expires, the FE then transitions to the pre-association state
      and FE will operationally bring down its forwarding path (and set
      the <xref target="RFC5812"/> FEObject FEState component to OperDisable).
      </t>
          <t>
      If the FE, while in the not associated state, manages to reconnect
      to a new primary CE before CEFTI expires it transitions to the
      Associated state. Once re-associated, the CE may try to synchronize any
      state that the FE may have lost during disconnection.  
      How the CE re-synchronizes such state is out of scope for
      the current ForCES architecture but would typically constitute the issuing
      of new configs and queries.
      </t>
          <t>
      An explicit message (a Config message setting Primary CE component in
      ForCES Protocol object) from the primary CE, can also be used to change
      the Primary CE for an FE during normal protocol operation. In this case,
      the FE transitions to the Not Associated State and attempts to 
      Associate with the new CE.

          <t>At this level, control of all lower layers, for example transport
level (such as IP addresses, MAC addresses etc) and associated links
going down are the role of the TML.</t>
          <t>PL Level: <vspace/> All other functionality, including
configuring the HA behavior during setup, the Control Element IDs (CE IDs) used to
identify primary and secondary CEs, protocol messages used to report CE
failure (Event Report), Heartbeat messages used to detect association
failure, messages to change the primary CE (Config), and other HA
related operations described in <xref target="HAnow"/>, are the PL's 
responsibility.</t>
          <t>To put the two together, if a path to a primary CE is down, the TML
would help recover from a failure by switching over to a backup path, if one is available.
If the CE is totally unreachable then the PL would be informed and it
would take the appropriate actions described before.</t>

    <section title="CE HA Hot Standby" anchor="hsb">
      <t>
In this section we describe small extensions to the existing
scheme to enable hot standby HA. To achieve hot standby HA,
we target to improve the specific goals defined in 
<xref target="quant"/>, namely:
 <list style="symbols">
          <t>
   How fast a backup CE becomes operational.
  </t>
          <t>
   How fast the FEs associate with the new master CE.
  </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
As described in <xref target="HAnow"/>, in the pre-association phase
the FEM configures the FE to make it aware of all the CEs in the NE. The FEM MUST 
configure the FE to make it aware which CE is the master and MAY specify any 
backup CE(s). 
</t>
      <section title="Changes to the FEPO model" anchor="fepo-changes">
        <t>In order for the above to be achievable there is a need to make 
a few changes in the FEPO model. <xref target="Appendix"/> contains the

        <t>
The FE's FEPO LFB version 1.1 AllCEs table contains 
all the CE IDs that the FE may connect and associate with. The ordering 
of the CE IDs in this table defines the priority order in which an FE 
will connect to the CEs. This table is provisioned initially from the
configuration plane (FEM).
In the pre-association phase, the first CE (lowest table index) 
in the AllCEs table MUST be the first CE that the FE will attempt 
to connect and associate with. 
If the FE fails to connect and associate with the first listed CE, it will 
attempt to connect to the second CE and so forth, and cycles back to the 
beginning of the list until there is a successful association.
The FE MUST associate with at least one CE.
Upon a successful association, a component of the FEPO LFB, specifically 
the CEID component, identifies the current associated master CE.
</t>
        <t>
While it would be much simpler to have the FE not respond to any messages
from a CE other than the master, in practise it has been found to be useful
to respond to queries and heartbeats from backup CEs. For this reason, we
allow backup CEs to issues queries to the FE.
Configuration messages (SET/DEL) from
backup CEs MUST be dropped by the FE and logged as received errors. </t>
        <t>Asynchronous events that the master CE has subscribed to, as well as 
heartbeats are sent to all associated-to CEs. 
Packet redirects continue to be sent only to the master CE. The 
Heartbeat Interval, the CE Heartbeat Policy (CEHB) and the FE Heartbeat Policy (FEHB) are global
for all CEs(and changed only by the master CE).

Once the FE has associated with a master CE it moves to the 
post-association phase (Associated state). 
It is assumed that the master CE will communicate with other CEs 
within the NE for the purpose of synchronization via the CE-CE interface. 
The CE-CE interface is out of scope for this document.
An election result amongst CEs may result in desire to change mastership
to a different associated CE; at which point current assumed master CE
will instruct the FE to use a different master CE.

While in the post-association phase, if the CE Failover Policy is set

The FE MAY retry to reassociate with unreachable CEs when possible.
</t>
        <t>
When the master CE for any reason is considered to be down, then the FE 
MUST try to find the first associated CE from the list of all CEs in a 
round-robin fashion.
</t>
        <t>If the FE is unable to find an associated FE in its list of CEs, 
then it MUST attempt to connect and associate with the first 
from the list of all CEs and continue in a round-robin fashion 
until it connects and associates with a CE or the CEFTI timer expires.
</t>
        <t>
Once the FE selects an associated CE to use as the new master,
the FE issues a PrimaryCEDown Event Notification to all 
associated CEs to notify them that the last primary CE went down 
(and what its identity was); a second event PrimaryCEChanged
identifying the new master CE is sent as well to identify which CE 
the reporting FE considers to be the new master.
</t>
        <t>
In most HA architectures there exists the possibility of 
split-brain. However, since in our setup the FE will never accept any 
configuration messages from any other than the master CE, we 
consider the FE as fenced against data corruption from the other CEs 
that consider themselves as the master. The split-brain issue becomes mostly a 
CE-CE communication problem which is considered to be out of scope.
</t>
        <t>
By virtue of having multiple CE connections, the FE switchover
to a new master CE will be relatively much faster. The overall effect
is improving the NE recovery time in case of communication
failure or faults of the master CE. This satisfies the requirement
we set to achieve.

<t>Following the policies outlined in "Guidelines for Writing an IANA

<t>The same rules applies as defined in <xref target="RFC5812"></xref> with the addition that entries must provide the LFB version as a string.</t>
<t>Upon publication of this document, all current entries are assigned a value of 1.0.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t> Security consideration as defined in section 9 of <xref target="RFC5810"/> applies securing
each CE-FE communication. Multiple CEs associated with the same FE still require the same procedure to be followed on a per-association basis.</t>
<t>While CE-CE plane is outside current scope of ForCES, we recognize that it may be subjected to attacks which may affect the CE-FE communication.</t>
<t>The following considerations should be made:
<list style="numbers">
  <t>CEs should use secure communication channels between for coordination and keeping of state at least to avoid connection of malicious CEs.</t>
  <t>The master CE should take into account DoS and DDoS attacks from malicious or malfunctioning CEs.</t>
  <t>CEs should take into account the split-brain issue. There are currently two fail-safes in the FE, firstly the FE has the CEID component that denotes which CE is the master and secondly the FE does not allow BackupCEs to configure the FE. However backup CEs that consider that the master CE has dropped and themselves as master should first do a sanity check and query the FE CEID component.</t>

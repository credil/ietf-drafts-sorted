              ForCES Logical Function Block (LFB) Library
                      draft-ietf-forces-lfb-lib-04

Abstract

   This document defines basic classes of Logical Function Blocks (LFBs)
   used in the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES).  It
   is defined according to ForCES FE model [RFC5812] and ForCES protocol
   [RFC5810] specifications.  These basic LFB classes are scoped to meet
   requirements of typical router functions and considered as the basic
   LFB library for ForCES.  Descriptions of individual LFBs are
   presented and detailed XML definitions are included in the library.
   Several use cases of the defined LFB classes are also proposed.

2.  Definitions

   This document follows the terminology defined by the ForCES
   Requirements in [RFC3654]and by the ForCES framework in [RFC3746].
   The definitions below are repeated for clarity.

      Control Element (CE) - A logical entity that implements the ForCES
      protocol and uses it to instruct one or more FEs on how to process
      packets.  CEs handle functionality such as the execution of
      control and signaling protocols.

      Forwarding Element (FE) - A logical entity that implements the
      ForCES protocol.  FEs use the underlying hardware to provide per-
      packet processing and handling as directed/controlled by one or
      more CEs via the ForCES protocol.

      ForCES Network Element (NE) - An entity composed of one or more
      CEs and one or more FEs.  To entities outside an NE, the NE
      represents a single point of management.  Similarly, an NE usually
      hides its internal organization from external entities.

      LFB (Logical Function Block) - The basic building block that is
      operated on by the ForCES protocol.  The LFB is a well defined,
      logically separable functional block that resides in an FE and is
      controlled by the CE via ForCES protocol.  The LFB may reside at
      the FE's datapath and process packets or may be purely an FE
      control or configuration entity that is operated on by the CE.
      Note that the LFB is a functionally accurate abstraction of the
      FE's processing capabilities, but not a hardware-accurate
      representation of the FE implementation.

      FE Topology - A representation of how the multiple FEs within a
      single NE are interconnected.  Sometimes this is called inter-FE
      topology, to be distinguished from intra-FE topology (i.e., LFB
      topology).

      LFB Class and LFB Instance - LFBs are categorized by LFB Classes.
      An LFB Instance represents an LFB Class (or Type) existence.
      There may be multiple instances of the same LFB Class (or Type) in
      an FE.  An LFB Class is represented by an LFB Class ID, and an LFB
      Instance is represented by an LFB Instance ID.  As a result, an
      LFB Class ID associated with an LFB Instance ID uniquely specifies
      an LFB existence.

      LFB Metadata - Metadata is used to communicate per-packet state
      from one LFB to another, but is not sent across the network.  The
      FE model defines how such metadata is identified, produced and
      consumed by the LFBs.  It defines the functionality but not how

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


      metadata is encoded within an implementation.

      LFB Component - Operational parameters of the LFBs that must be
      visible to the CEs are conceptualized in the FE model as the LFB
      components.  The LFB components include, for example, flags,
      single parameter arguments, complex arguments, and tables that the
      CE can read and/or write via the ForCES protocol (see below).

      LFB Topology - Representation of how the LFB instances are
      logically interconnected and placed along the datapath within one
      FE.  Sometimes it is also called intra-FE topology, to be
      distinguished from inter-FE topology.

      ForCES Protocol - While there may be multiple protocols used
      within the overall ForCES architecture, the term "ForCES protocol"
      and "protocol" refer to the Fp reference points in the ForCES
      Framework in [RFC3746].  This protocol does not apply to CE-to-CE
      communication, FE-to-FE communication, or to communication between
      FE and CE managers.  Basically, the ForCES protocol works in a
      master-slave mode in which FEs are slaves and CEs are masters.
      This document defines the specifications for this ForCES protocol.

3.  Introduction

   RFC 3746 [RFC3746] specifies Forwarding and Control Element
   Separation (ForCES) framework.  In the framework, Control Elements
   (CEs) configure and manage one or more separate Forwarding Elements
   (FEs) within a Network Element (NE) by use of a ForCES protocol.  RFC
   5810 [RFC5810] specifies the ForCES protocol.  RFC 5812 [RFC5812]
   specifies the Forwarding Element (FE) model.  In the model, resources
   in FEs are described by classes of Logical Function Blocks (LFBs).
   The FE model defines the structure and abstract semantics of LFBs,
   and provides XML schema for the definitions of LFBs.

   This document conforms to the specifications of the FE model
   [RFC5812] and specifies detailed definitions of classes of LFBs,
   including detailed XML definitions of LFBs.  These LFBs form a base
   LFB library for ForCES.  LFBs in the base library are expected to be
   combined to form an LFB topology for a typical router to implement IP
   forwarding.  It should be emphasized that an LFB is an abstraction of
   functions rather than its implementation details.  The purpose of the
   LFB definitions is to represent functions so as to provide
   interoperability between separate CEs and FEs.

   More LFB classes with more functions may be developed in future time
   and documented by IETF.  Vendors may also develop proprietary LFB
   classes as described in the FE model [RFC5812].

3.1.  Scope of the Library

   It is intended that the LFB classes described in this document are
   designed to provide the functions of a typical router.  RFC 1812
   specifies that a typical router is expected to provide functions to:

   (1) Interface to packet networks and implement the functions required
   by that network.  These functions typically include:

   o  Encapsulating and decapsulating the IP datagrams with the
      connected network framing (e.g., an Ethernet header and checksum),

   o  Sending and receiving IP datagrams up to the maximum size
      supported by that network, this size is the network's Maximum
      Transmission Unit or MTU,

   o  Translating the IP destination address into an appropriate
      network-level address for the connected network (e.g., an Ethernet
      hardware address), if needed, and

   o  Responding to network flow control and error indications, if any.

   (2) Conform to specific Internet protocols including the Internet
   Protocol (IPv4 and/or IPv6), Internet Control Message Protocol
   (ICMP), and others as necessary.

   (3) Receive and forwards Internet datagrams.  Important issues in
   this process are buffer management, congestion control, and fairness.

   o  Recognizes error conditions and generates ICMP error and
      information messages as required.

   o  Drops datagrams whose time-to-live fields have reached zero.

   o  Fragments datagrams when necessary to fit into the MTU of the next
      network.

   (4) Choose a next-hop destination for each IP datagram, based on the
   information in its routing database.

   (5) Usually support an interior gateway protocol (IGP) to carry out
   distributed routing and reachability algorithms with the other
   routers in the same autonomous system.  In addition, some routers
   will need to support an exterior gateway protocol (EGP) to exchange
   topological information with other autonomous systems.  For all
   routers, it is essential to provide ability to manage static routing
   items.

   (6) Provide network management and system support facilities,
   including loading, debugging, status reporting, exception reporting
   and control.

   The classical IP router utilizing the ForCES framework constitutes a
   CE running some controlling IGP and/or EGP function and FEs
   implementing using Logical Function Blocks (LFBs) conforming to the
   FE model[RFC5812] specifications.  The CE, in conformance to the
   ForCES protocol[RFC5810] and the FE model [RFC5812] specifications,
   instructs the LFBs on the FE how to treat received/sent packets.

   Packets in an IP router are received and transmitted on physical
   media typically referred to as "ports".  Different physical port
   media will have different way for encapsulating outgoing frames and
   decapsulating incoming frames.  The different physical media will
   also have different attributes that influence its behavior and how
   frames get encapsulated or decapsulated.  This document will only
   deal with Ethernet physical media.  Other future documents may deal
   with other types of media.  This document will also interchangeably
   refer to a port to be an abstraction that constitutes a PHY and a MAC
   as described by the LFBs like EtherPHYCop, EtherMACIn, and
   EtherMACOut.

   IP packets emanating from port LFBs are then processed by a
   validation LFB before being further forwarded to the next LFB.  After
   the validation process the packet is passed to an LFB where IP
   forwarding decision is made.  In the IP Forwarding LFBs, a Longest
   Prefix Match LFB is used to look up the destination information in a
   packet and select a next hop index for sending the packet onward.  A
   next hop LFB uses the next hop index metadata to apply the proper
   headers to the IP packets, and direct them to the proper egress.
   Note that in the process of IP packets processing, in this document,
   we are adhering to the weak-host model[RFC1122] since that is the
   most usable model for a packet processing Network Element.

3.2.  Overview of LFB Classes in the Library

   It is critical to classify functional requirements into various
   classes of LFBs and construct a typical but also flexible enough base
   LFB library for various IP forwarding equipments.

3.2.1.  LFB Design Choices

   A few design principles were factored into choosing how the base LFBs
   looked like.  These are:

   o  if a function can be designed by either one LFB or two or more
      LFBs with the same cost, the choice is to go with two or more LFBs
      so as to provide more flexibility for implementers.

   o  when flexibility is not required, an LFB should take advantage of
      its independence as much as possible and have minimal coupling
      with other LFBs.  The coupling may be from LFB attributes
      definitions as well as physical implementations.

   o  unless there is a clear difference in functionality, similar
      packet processing should not be represented as two or more
      different LFBs.  Or else, it may add extra burden on
      implementation to achieve interoperability.

3.2.2.  LFB Class Groupings

   The document defines groups of LFBs for typical router function
   requirements:

   (1) A group of Ethernet processing LFBs are defined to abstract the
   packet processing for Ethernet as the port media type.  As the most
   popular media type with rich processing features, Ethernet media
   processing LFBs was a natural choice.  Definitions for processing of
   other port media types like POS or ATM may be incorporated in the
   library in future version of the document or in a future separate

   document.

   The following LFBs are defined for Ethernet processing:

      EtherPHYCop (section 5.1.1)

      EtherMACIn (section 5.1.2)

      EtherClassifier (section 5.1.3)

      EtherEncapsulator (section 5.1.4)

      EtherMACOut (section 5.1.5)

3.2.3.  Sample LFB Class Application

   Although section 7 will present use cases for LFBs defined in this
   document, this section shows a sample LFB class application in
   advance so that readers can get a quick overlook of the LFB classes

   Figure 1 shows the typical LFB processing path for an IPv4 unicast
   forwarding case with Ethernet media interfaces.  To focus on the IP
   forwarding function, some inputs or outputs of LFBs in the figure
   that are not related to the function are missed.  Section 7.1 will
   describe the LFB topology in more details.

3.3.  Document Structure

   Base type definitions, including data types, packet frame types, and
   etadata types are presented in advance for definitions of various LFB
   classes.  Section 4 (Base Types Section) provide a description on the
   base types used by this LFB library.  In order for an extensive use
   of these base types for other LFB class definitions, the base type
   definitions are provided by an xml file in a way as a library which
   is separate from the LFB definition library.

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


   Within every group of LFB classes, a set of LFBs are defined for
   individual function purposes.  Section 5 (LFB Class Descriptions
   Section) makes text descriptions on the individual LFBs.  Note that
   for a complete definition of an LFB, a text description as well as a
   XML definition is required.

   LFB classes are finally defined by XML with specifications and schema
   defined in the ForCES FE model[RFC5812].  Section 6 (XML LFB
   Definitions Section) provide the complete XML definitions of the base
   LFB classes library..

   Section 7 provides several use cases on how some typical router
   functions can be implemented using the base LFB library defined in
   this document.

4.  Base Types

   TThe FE model [RFC5812] has specified the following data types as
   predefined (built-in) atomic data-types:

   char, uchar, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, string[N],
   string, byte[N], boolean, octetstring[N], float16, float32, float64.

   Based on these atomic data types and with the use of type definition
   elements in the FE model XML schema, new data types, packet frame
   types, and metadata types can further be defined.

   To define a base LFB library for typical router functions, a base
   data types, frame types, and metadata types MUST be defined.  This
   section provides a description of these types and detailed XML
   definitions for the base types.

   In order for extensive use of the base type definitions for LFB
   definitions other than this base LFB library, the base type
   definitions are provided with a separate xml library file labeled
   with "BaseTypeLibrary".  Users can refer to this library by the
   statement:


   <load library="BaseTypeLibrary", location="..."/>

4.1.  Data

   The following data types are currently defined and put in the base
   type library:

   (TBD)

4.2.  Frame

   According to FE model [RFC5812], frame types are used in LFB
   definitions to define the types of frames the LFB expects at its
   input port(s) and emits at its output port(s).  The <frameDef>
   element in the FE model is used to define a new frame type.

   The following frame types are currently defined and put in the base
   type library as base frame types for the LFB library:

   (TBD)

4.3.  MetaData

   LFB Metadata is used to communicate per-packet state from one LFB to
   another.  The <metadataDef> element in the FE model is used to define
   a new metadata type.

   The following metadata types are currently defined and put in the
   base type library as base metadata types for the LFB library
   definitions:

   (TBD)

5.  LFB Class Description

   According to ForCES specifications, LFB (Logical Function Block) is a
   well defined, logically separable functional block that resides in an
   FE, and is a functionally accurate abstraction of the FE's processing
   capabilities.  An LFB Class (or type) is a template that represents a
   fine-grained, logically separable aspect of FE processing.  Most LFBs
   are related to packet processing in the data path.  LFB classes are
   the basic building blocks of the FE model.  Note that RFC 5810 has
   already defined an 'FE Protocol LFB' which is as a logical entity in
   each FE to control the ForCES protocol.  RFC 5812 has already defined
   an 'FE Object LFB'.  Information like the FE Name, FE ID, FE State,
   LFB Topology in the FE are represented in this LFB.

   As specified in Section 3.1, this document focuses the base LFB
   library for implementing typical router functions, especially for IP
   forwarding functions.  As a result, LFB classes in the library are
   all base LFBs to implement router forwarding.

5.1.  Ethernet Processing LFBs

   As the most popular physical and data link layer protocols, Ethernets
   are widely deployed.  It becomes a basic requirement for a router to
   be able to process various Ethernet data packets.

   Note that there exist different versions of Ethernet protocols, like
   Ethernet V2, 802.3 RAW, IEEE 802.3/802.2, IEEE 802.3/802.2 SNAP.
   There also exist varieties of LAN techniques based on Ethernet, like
   various VLANs, MACinMAC, etc.  Ethernet processing LFBs defined here
   are intended to be able to cope with all these variations of Ethernet
   technology.

   There are also various types of Ethernet physical interface media.
   Among them, copper and fiber media may be the most popular ones.  As
   a base LFB definition and a start work, the document only defines an
   Ethernet physical LFB with copper media.  For other media interfaces,
   specific LFBs may be defined in the future versions of the library.

5.1.1.  EtherPHYCop

   EtherPHYCop LFB abstracts an Ethernet interface physical layer with
   media limited to copper.

5.1.1.1.  Data Handling

   This LFB is the interface to the Ethernet physical media.  The LFB
   handles ethernet frames coming in from or going out of the FE.
   Ethernet frames sent and received cover all packets encapsulated with

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


   different versions of Ethernet protocols, like Ethernet V2, 802.3
   RAW, IEEE 802.3/802.2,IEEE 802.3/802.2 SNAP, including packets
   encapsulated with varieties of LAN techniques based on Ethernet, like
   various VLANs, MACinMAC, etc.  Therefore in the XML an EthernetAll
   frame type has been introduced.

   Ethernet frames are received from the physical media port and passed
   downstream to LFBs such as EtherMACIn via a singleton output known as
   "EtherPHYOut".  A 'PHYPortID' metadatum, to indicate which physical
   port the frame came into from the external world, is passed along
   with the frame.

   Ethernet packets are received by this LFB from upstream LFBs such
   EtherMacOut via the singleton input known as "EtherPHYIn" before
   being sent out onto the external world.

5.1.1.2.  Components

   The AdminStatus component is defined for CE to administratively
   manage the status of the LFB.  The CE may adminstratively startup or
   shutdown the LFB by changing the value of AdminStatus.  The default
   value is set to 'Down'.

   An OperStatus component captures the physical port operational
   status.  A PHYPortStatusChanged event is defined so the LFB can
   report to the CE whenever there is an operational status change of
   the physical port.

   The PHYPortID component is a unique identification for a physical
   port.  It is defined as 'read-only' by CE.  Its value is enumerated
   by FE.  The component will be used to produce a 'PHYPortID' metadatum
   at the LFB output and to associate it to every Ethernet packet this
   LFB receives.  The metadatum will be handed to downstream LFBs for
   them to use the PHYPortID.

   A group of components are defined for link speed management.  The
   AdminLinkSpeed is for CE to configure link speed for the port and the
   OperLinkSpeed is for CE to query the actual link speed in operation.
   The default value for the AdminLinkSpeed is set to auto-negotiation
   mode.

   A group of components are defined for duplex mode management.  The
   AdminDuplexMode is for CE to configure proper duplex mode for the
   port and the OperDuplexMode is for CE to query the actual duplex mode
   in operation.  The default value for the AdminDuplexMode is set to
   auto-negotiation mode.

   A CarrierStatus component captures the status of the carrier and

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


   specifies whether the port is linked with an operational connector.
   The default value for the CarrierStatus is 'false'.

5.1.1.3.  Capabilities

   The capability information for this LFB includes the link speeds that
   are supported by the FE (SupportedLinkSpeed) as well as the supported
   duplex modes (SupportedDuplexMode).

5.1.1.4.  Events

   This LFB is defined to be able to generate several events in which
   the CE may be interested.  There is an event for changes in the
   status of the physical port (PhyPortStatusChanged).  Such an event
   will notify that the physical port status has been changed and the
   report will include the new status of the physical port.

   Another event captures changes in the operational link speed
   (LinkSpeedChanged).  Such an event will notify the CE that the
   operational speed has been changed and the report will include the
   new negotiated operational speed.

   A final event captures changes in the duplex mode
   (DuplexModeChanged).  Such an event will notify the CE that the
   duplex mode has been changed and the report will include the new
   negotiated duplex mode.

5.1.2.  EtherMACIn

   EtherMACIn LFB abstracts an Ethernet port at MAC data link layer.  It
   specifically describes Ethernet processing functions like MAC address
   locality check, deciding if the Ethernet packets should be bridged,
   provide Ethernet layer flow control, etc.

5.1.2.1.  Data Handling

   The LFB is expected to receive all types of Ethernet packets, via a
   singleton input known as "EtherMACIn", which are usually output from
   some Ethernet physical layer LFB, like an EtherPHYCop LFB, alongside
   with a metadatum indicating the physical port ID that the packet
   comes.

   The LFB is defined with two separate singleton outputs.  All Output
   packets are in Ethernet format, as received from the physical layer
   LFB and cover all types of Ethernet packets.

   The first singleton output is known as "NormalPathOut".  It usually
   outputs Ethernet packets to some LFB like an EtherClassifier LFB for



Wang, et al.            Expires December 4, 2011               [Page 38]

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


   further L3 forwarding process alongside with a PHYPortID metadata
   indicating which physical port the packet came from.

   The second singleton output is known as "L2BridgingPathOut".
   Although the LFB library this document defines is basically to meet
   typical router functions, it will attempt to be forward compatible
   with future router functions.  The "L2BridgingPathOut" is defined to
   meet the requirement that L2 bridging functions may be optionally
   supported simultaneously with L3 processing and some L2 bridging LFBs
   that may be defined in the future.  If the FE supports L2 bridging,
   the CE can enable or disable it by means of a "L2BridgingPathEnable"
   component in the FE.  If it is enabled, by also instantiating some L2
   bridging LFB instances following the L2BridgingPathOut, FEs are
   expected to fulfill L2 bridging functions.  L2BridgingPathOut will
   output packets exactly the same as that in the NormalPathOut output.

   This LFB can be set to work in a Promiscuous Mode, allowing all
   packets to pass through the LFB without being dropped.  Otherwise, a
   locality check will be performed based on the local MAC addresses.
   All packets that do not pass through the locality check will be
   dropped.

   This LFB can perform Ethernet layer flow control.  This is usually
   implemented cooperatively by the EtherMACIn LFB and the EtherMACOut
   LFB.  The flow control is further distinguished by Tx flow control
   and Rx flow control, separately for sending process and receiving
   process flow controls.

5.1.2.2.  Components

   The AdminStatus component is defined for CE to administratively
   manage the status of the LFB.  The CE may administratively startup or
   shutdown the LFB by changing the value of AdminStatus.  The default
   value is set to 'Down'.

   The LocalMACAddresses component specifies the local MAC addresses
   based on which locality checks will be made.  This component is an
   array of MAC addresses, and of 'read-write' access permission.

   An L2BridgingPathEnable component captures whether the LFB is set to
   work as a L2 bridge.  An FE that does not support bridging will
   internally set this flag to false, and additionally set the flag
   property as read-only.  The default value for is 'false'.

   The PromiscuousMode component specifies whether the LFB is set to
   work as in a promiscuous mode.  The default value for is 'false'.

   The TxFlowControl component defines whether the LFB is performing

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


   flow control on sending packets.  The default value for is 'false'

   The RxFlowControl component defines whether the LFB is performing
   flow contron on receiving packets.  The default value for is 'false'.

   A struct component, MACInStats, defines a set of statistics for this
   LFB, including the number of received packets and the number of
   dropped packets.

5.1.2.3.  Capabilities

   This LFB does not have a list of capabilities.

5.1.2.4.  Events

   This LFB does not have any events specified.

5.1.3.  EtherClassifier

   EtherClassifier LFB abstracts the process to decapsulate Ethernet
   packets and classify the data packets into various network layer data
   packets according to information included in the Ethernet packets
   headers.

   Input of the LFB expects all types of Ethernet packets, including
   VLAN Ethernet types.  The input is a singleton input which may
   connect to an upstream LFB like EtherMACIn LFB.  The input is also
   capable of multiplexing to allow for multiple upstream LFBs being
   connected.  For instance, when L2 bridging function is enabled in
   EtherMACIn LFB, some L2 bridging LFBs may be applied.  In this case,
   some Ethernet packets after L2 processing may have to be input to
   EtherClassifier LFB for classification, while simultaneously packets
   directly output from EtherMACIn may also need to input to this LFB.
   Input of this LFB is capable of handling this case.  Usually, every
   input Ethernet packet is expected to be associated with a PHYPortID
   metadatum, indicating the physical port the packet comes from.  In
   some cases, for instance, like in an MACinMAC case, a LogicalPortID
   metadatum may be expected to associate with the Ethernet packet to
   further indicate which logical port the Ethernet packet belongs to.
   Note that PHYPortID metadata is always expected while LogicalPortID
   metadata is optionally expected.

   A VLANInputTable component is defined in the LFB to classify VLAN
   Ethernet packets.  According to IEEE VLAN specifications, all
   Ethernet packets can be recognized as VLAN types by defining that if
   there is no VLAN encapsulation in a packet, a case with VLAN tag 0 is
   considered.  Therefore the table actually applies to every input
   packet of the LFB.  The table assigns every input packet with a new



Wang, et al.            Expires December 4, 2011               [Page 40]

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


   LogicalPortID according to the packet incoming port ID and the VLAN
   ID.  A packet incoming port ID is defined as a physical port ID if
   there is no logical port ID associated with the packet, or a logical
   port ID if there is a logical port ID associated with the packet.
   The VLAN ID is exactly the Vlan ID in the packet if it is a VLAN
   packet, or 0 if it is not a VLAN packet.  Note that a logical port ID
   of a packet may be rewritten with a new one by the VLANInputTable
   processing.

   An EtherDispatchTable component is defined to dispatch every Ethernet
   packet to a group of outputs according to the logical port ID
   assigned by VLANInputTable to the packet and the Ethernet type in the
   Ethernet packet header.  By CE configuring the dispatch table, the
   LFB can be expected to classify various network layer protocol type
   packets and make them output at different output port.  It is then
   easily expected that the LFB classify packets according to protocols
   like IPv4, IPv6, MPLS, ARP, ND, etc.

   Output of the LFB is hence defined as a group output.  Because there
   may be various types of protocol packets at the output ports, the
   frameproduced is defined as arbitrary for the purpose of wide
   extensibility in the future.  In order for downstream LFBs to use, a
   bunch of metadata is produced to associate with every output packet.
   The medatdata contain normal information like PHYPortID.  It also
   contains information on Ethernet type, source MAC address, and
   destination MAC address of its original Ethernet packet.  Moreover,
   it contains information of logical port ID assigned by this LFB.
   This metadata may be used by downstream LFBs for packet processing.
   Lastly, it may conditionally contain information like VlanID and
   VlanPriority with the condition that the packet is a VLAN packet.

   A MaxOutPutPorts is defined as the capability of the LFB to indicate
   how many classification output ports the LFB is capable.
   /*discussion*/

   Note that logical port ID and physical port ID mentioned above are
   all originally configured by CE, and are globally effective within an
   ForCES NE (Network Element).  To distinguish a physical port ID from
   a logical port ID in the incoming port ID field of the
   VLANInputTable, physical port ID and logical port ID must be assigned
   with separate number spaces. /*discussion */

   There are also some other components, capabilities, events defined in
   the LFB for various purposes.  See section 6 for detailed XML
   definitions of the LFB.

5.1.4.  EtherEncapsulator

   EtherEncapsulator LFB abstracts the process to encapsulate IP packets
   to Ethernet packets.

   Input of the LFB expects types of IP packets, including IPv4 and IPv6
   types.  The input is a singleton one which may connect to an upstream
   LFB like an IPv4NextHop, an IPv6NextHop, or any LFB which requires to
   output packets for Ethernet encapsulation.  The input is capable of
   multiplexing to allow for multiple upstream LFBs being connected.
   For instance, an IPv4NextHop or an IPv6NextHop may concurrently
   exist, and some L2 bridging LFBs may also output packets to this LFB
   simultaneously.  Input of this LFB is capable of handling this case.
   Usually, every input Ethernet packet is expected to be associated
   with an output logical port ID and a next hop IP address as its
   metadata.  In the case when L2 bridging function is implemented, an
   input packet may also optionally receive a VLAN priority as its
   metadata.  In this case, default value for this metadata is set to 0.

   There are several outputs for this LFB.  One singleton output is for
   normal success packet output.  Packets which have found Ethernet L2
   information and have been successfully encapsulated to an Ethernet
   packet will output from this port to downstream LFB.  Note that this
   LFB specifies to use Ethernet II as its Ethernet encapsulation type.
   Success output also produces an output logical port ID as metadatum
   of every output packet for a downstream LFB to decide which logical
   port the packet should go out.  The downstream LFB usually dispatches
   the packets based on its associated output logical port ID.  Hence, a
   generic dispatch LFB as defined in Section 5.6.1 may be adopted for
   dispatching packets based on output logical port ID.

   Note that in some implementations of LFBs topology, the processing to
   dispatch packets based on an output logical port ID may also take
   place before an Ethernet encapsulation,i.e., packets coming into the
   encapsulator LFB have already been switched to individual logical
   output port paths.  In this case, the EtherEncap LFB success output
   may be directly connected to a downstream LFB like an EtherMACOut
   LFB.

   Another singleton output is for IPv4 packets that are unfortunately
   unable to find Ethernet L2 encapsulation information by ARP table in
   the LFB.  In this case, a copy of the packets may need to be
   redirected to an ARP LFB in the FE, or to CE if ARP function is
   implemented by CE.  More importantly, a next hop IP address metadata
   should be associated with every packet output here.  When an ARP LFB
   or CE receives these packets and associated next hop IP address
   metadata, it may be expected to generate ARP protocol messages based
   on these packets next hop IP addresses to try to get L2 information

   for these packets.  Refreshed L2 information is then able to be added
   in ARP table in this encapsulator LFB by ARP LFB or by CE.  As a
   result, these packets are then able to successfully find L2
   information and be encapsulated to Ethernet packets, and output via
   the normal success output to downstream LFB.  (Editorial note1: may
   need discussion on what more metadata this output packets need?  Note
   that the packets may be redirected to CE and CE should know what the
   purpose of the packets for.  A metadata may need to indicate this.
   Editorial note2: we may adopt another way to address the case of
   packets unable to do ARP.  The packets may be redirected to ARP LFB
   or CE without keeping a copy of them in this encapsulator LFB.  We
   expect that after ARP LFB or CE have processed ARP requests based on
   the packets, the packets will be redirected back from ARP LFB or CE
   to this encapsulator LFB for Ethernet encapsulation.  At this time,
   it is hoped the ARP table has been refreshed with new L2 information
   that will make these packets able to find)

   A more singleton output is for IPv6 packets that are unfortunately
   unable to find Ethernet L2 encapsulation information by Neighbor
   table in the LFB.  In this case, a copy of the packets may need to be
   redirected to an ND LFB in the FE, or to CE if IPv6 Neighbor
   discovery function is implemented by CE.  More importantly, a next
   hop IP address metadata should be associated with every packet output
   here.  When the ND LFB or CE receives these packets and associated
   next hop IP address metadata, it may be expected to generate neighbor
   discovery protocol messages based on these packets next hop IP
   addresses to try to get L2 information for these packets.  Refreshed
   L2 information is then able to be added in neighbor table in this LFB
   by ND LFB or by CE.  As a result, these packets are then able to
   successfully find L2 information and be encapsulated to Ethernet
   packets, and output via the normal success output to downstream
   LFB.(Editorial note: may need discussion on what more metadata this
   output packets need?  Note that the packets may be redirected to CE
   and CE should know what the purpose of the packets for.  A metadata
   may need to indicate this)

   A singleton output is specifically defined for exception packets
   output.  All packets that are abnormal during the operations in this
   LFB are output via this port.  Currently, only one abnormal case is
   defined, that is, packets can not find proper information in a VLAN
   output table.

   The VLAN output table is defined as the component of the LFB.  The
   table uses a logical port ID as an index to find a VLAN ID and a new
   output logical port ID.  In reality, the logical port ID applied here
   is the output logical port ID received from every input packet in its
   associated metadata.  According to IEEE VLAN specifications, all
   Ethernet packets can be recognized as VLAN types by defining that if

   there is no VLAN encapsulation in a packet, a case with VLAN tag 0 is
   considered.  Therefore, every input IP packet actually has to look up
   the VLAN output table to find out a VLAN ID and a new output logical
   port ID according to its original logical port ID..

   The ARP table in the LFB is defined as a component of the LFB.  The
   table is for IPv4 packet to find its next hop Ethernet layer MAC
   addresses.  Input IPv4 packet will use an output logical port ID
   which is got by looking up the VLAN output table, and a next hop IPv4
   address which is got by upstream next hop applicator LFB, to look up
   the ARP table to find the Ethernet L2 information, i.e., the source
   MAC address and destination MAC address.

   The neighbor table is defined as another component of the LFB.  The
   table is for IPv6 packet to find its next hop Ethernet layer MAC
   addresses.  Like the ARP table, input IPv6 packet will use its output
   logical port ID got from looking up the VLAN output table, and the
   packet next hop IPv4 address got by upstream next hop applicator LFB,
   to look up the neighbor table to find the Ethernet source MAC address
   and destination MAC address.

   As will be described in the address resolution LFBs section (section
   5.4), Layer 2 address resolution protocols may be implemented with
   two choices.  One is by FE with specific address resolution LFB, like
   an ARP LFB or an ND LFB.  The other is to redirect address resolution
   protocol messages to CE for CE to implement the function.

   As described in section 5.4, the ARP LFB defines the ARP table in
   this encapsulator LFB as its alias, and the ND LFB defines the
   neighbor table as its alias.  This means that the ARP table or the
   neighbor table will be maintained or refreshed by the ARP LFB or the
   ND LFB when the LFBs are used.

   Note that the ARP table and the neighbor table defined in this LFB
   are all with property of read-write.  CE can also configure the
   tables by ForCES protocol [RFC5810].  This makes possible that IPv4
   ARP protocol or IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol may be implemented
   at CE side,i.e., after CE manages an ARP or Neighbor discovery
   protocol and gets address resolution results, CE can configure them
   to an ARP or neighbor table in FE.

   With all the information got from VLAN table and ARP or Neighbor
   table, input IPv4 or IPv6 packets are then able to be encapsulated to
   Ethernet layer packets.  Note that according to IEEE 802.1Q, if input
   packets are with non-zero VLAN priority metadata, the packets will
   always be encapsulated with a VLAN tag, no matter the value of VLAN
   ID is zero or not.  If the VLAN priority and the VLAN ID are all
   zero, the packets will be encapsulated without a VLAN tag.

   Successfully encapsulated packets are then output via success output
   port.

   There are also some other components, capabilities, events defined in
   the LFB for various purposes.  See section 6 for detailed XML
   definitions of the LFB.

5.1.5.  EtherMACOut

   EtherMACOut LFB abstracts an Ethernet port at MAC data link layer.
   This LFB describes Ethernet packet output process.  Ethernet output
   functions are closely related to Ethernet input functions, therefore
   many components defined in this LFB are as aliases of EtherMACIn LFB
   components.

5.1.5.1.  Data Handling

   The LFB is expected to receive all types of Ethernet packets, via a
   singleton input known as "EtherPktsIn", which are usually output from
   an Ethernet encapsulation LFB, alongside with a metadatum indicating
   the physical port ID that the packet will go through(editorial note:
   need more discussion on the port ID being physical layer or L2
   layer).

   The LFB is defined with a singleton output.  All Output packets are
   in Ethernet format, possibly with various Ethernet types, alongside
   with a metadatum indicating the physical port ID the packet is to go
   through.  This output links to a downstream LFB that is usually an
   Ethernet physical LFB like EtherPHYcop LFB.

   This LFB can perform Ethernet layer flow control.  This is usually
   implemented cooperatively by the EtherMACIn LFB and the EtherMACOut
   LFB.  The flow control is further distinguished by Tx flow control
   and Rx flow control, separately for sending process and receiving
   process flow control.

   Note that as a base definition, functions like multiple virtual MAC
   layers are not supported in this LFB version.  It may be supported in
   the future by defining a subclass or a new version of this LFB

5.1.5.2.  Components

   The AdminStatus component is defined for CE to administratively
   manage the status of the LFB.  The CE may administratively startup or
   shutdown the LFB by changing the value of AdminStatus.  The default
   value is set to 'Down'.  Note that this component is defined as an
   alias of the AdminStatus component in the EtherMACIn LFB.  This
   infers that an EtherMACOut LFB usually coexists with an EtherMACIn



Wang, et al.            Expires December 4, 2011               [Page 45]

   LFB, both of which share the same administrative status management by
   CE.  Alias properties as defined in the ForCES FE model (RFC 5812)
   will be used by CE to declare the target component this alias refers,
   which include the target LFB class and instance IDs as well as the
   path to the target component.  Whereas, these properties are set by
   CE only when a system runs, which are outside the XML definitions of
   this LFB.

   The MTU component defines the maximum transmission unit

   The TxFlowControl component defines whether the LFB is performing
   flow control on sending packets.  The default value for is 'false'.
   Note that this component is defined as an alias of TxFlowControl
   component in the EtherMACIn LFB.

   The RxFlowControl component defines whether the LFB is performing
   flow control on receiving packets.  The default value for is 'false'.
   Note that this component is defined as an alias of RxFlowControl
   component in the EtherMACIn LFB.

   A struct component, MACOutStats, defines a set of statistics for this
   LFB, including the number of transmitted packets and the number of
   dropped packets.

5.1.5.3.  Capabilities

   This LFB does not have a list of capabilities.

5.1.5.4.  Events

   This LFB does not have any events specified.

5.2.  IP Packet Validation LFBs

   The LFBs are defined to abstract IP packet validation process.  An
   IPv4Validator LFB is specifically for IPv4 protocol validation and an
   IPv6Validator LFB for IPv6.

5.2.1.  IPv4Validator

   The IPv4Validator LFB performs IPv4 packets validation according to
   RFC 1812.

5.2.1.1.  Data Handling

   This LFB performs IPv4 validation according to RFC 1812.  Then the
   IPv4 packet will be output to the corresponding port regarding of the
   validation result, whether the packet is a unicast or a multicast



Wang, et al.            Expires December 4, 2011               [Page 46]

   one, an exception has occurred or the validation failed.

   This LFB always expects, as input, packets which have been indicated
   as IPv4 packets by an upstream LFB, like an EtherClassifier LFB.
   There is no specific metadata expected by the input of the LFB.

   Note that, as a default provision of RFC 5812, in FE model, all
   metadata produced by upstream LFBs will pass through all downstream
   LFBs by default without being specified by input port or output port.
   Only those metadata that will be used(consumed) by an LFB will be
   explicitly marked in input of the LFB as expected metadata.  For
   instance, in this LFB, even there is no specific metadata expected,
   metadata like PHYPortID produced by some upstream physical layer LFBs
   will always pass through this LFB.  In some cases, if some component
   in the LFB may use the metadata, it actually still can use it
   regardless of whether the metadata has been expected or not.

   Four output ports are defined to output various validation results.

   All validated IPv4 unicast packets will be output at the singleton
   port known as "IPv4UnicastOut".  All validated IPv4 multicast packets
   will be output at the singleton port known as "IPv4MulticastOut"
   port.  There is no metadata specifically required to produce at these
   output ports.

   A singleton port known as "ExceptionOut" is defined to output packets
   which have been validated as exception packets.  An exception ID
   metadatum is produced to indicate what has caused the exception.
   Currently defined exception types include:

   o  Packet with destination address equal to 255.255.255.255

   o  Packet with expired TTL

   o  Packet with header length more than 5 words

   o  Packet IP head including Router Alert options

   Note that, although TTL is checked in this LFB for validity,
   operations to TTL like TTL decreasing will be made only in a followed
   forwarding LFB.

   The final singleton port known as "FailOut" is defined for all
   packets which have failed the validation process.  A validate error
   ID is associated to every failed packet to indicate the reason.
   Currently defined reasons include:

   o  Packet size reported is less than 20 bytes

   o  Packet with version is not IPv4

   o  Packet with header length < 5

   o  Packet with total length field < 20

   o  Packet with invalid checksum

   o  Packet with source address equal to 255.255.255.255

   o  Packet with source address 0

   o  Packet with source address of form {127, <any>}

   o  Packet with source address in Class E domain

5.2.1.2.  Components

   This LFB has only one struct component, the
   IPv4ValidatorStatisticsType, which defines a set of statistics for
   validation process, including the number of bad header packets, the
   number of bad total length packets, the number of bad TTL packets,
   and the number of bad checksum packets.

5.2.1.3.  Capabilities

   This LFB does not have a list of capabilities

5.2.1.4.  Events

   This LFB does not have any events specified.

5.2.2.  IPv6Validator

   The IPv6Validator LFB performs IPv6 packets validation according to
   RFC 2460.

5.2.2.1.  Data Handling

   This LFB performs IPv6 validation according to RFC 2460.  Then the
   IPv6 packet will be output to the corresponding port regarding of the
   validation result, whether the packet is a unicast or a multicast
   one, an exception has occurred or the validation failed.

   This LFB always expects, as input, packets which have been indicated
   as IPv6 packets by an upstream LFB, like an EtherClassifier LFB.

   There is no specific metadata expected by the input of the LFB.

   Similar to the IPv4validator LFB, IPv6Validator has also defined four
   output ports to output packets for various validation results.

   All validated IPv6 unicast packets will be output at the singleton
   port known as "IPv6UnicastOut".  All validated IPv6 multicast packets
   will be output at the singleton port known as "IPv6MulticastOut"
   port.  There is no metadata specifically required to produce at these
   output ports.

   A singleton port known as "ExceptionOut" is defined to output packets
   which have been validated as exception packets.  An exception ID
   metadata is produced to indicate what caused the exception.
   Currently defined exception types include:

   o  Packet with hop limit to zero

   o  Packet with a link-local destination address

   o  Packet with a link-local source address

   o  Packet with destination all-routers

   o  Packet with destination all-nodes

   o  Packet with next header set to Hop-by-Hop

   The final singleton port known as "FailOut" is defined for all
   packets which have failed the validation process.  A validate error
   ID is associated to every failed packet to indicate the reason.
   Currently defined reasons include:

   o  Packet size reported is less than 40 bytes

   o  Packet with version is not IPv6

   o  Packet with multicast source address (the MSB of the source
      address is 0xFF)

   o  Packet with destination address set to 0 or ::1

   o  Packet with source address set to loopback (::1).

   Note that in the base type library, definitions for exception ID and
   validate error ID metadata are applied to both IPv4Validator and
   IPv6Validator LFBs, i.e., the two LFBs share the same medadata
   definition, with different ID assignment inside.

5.2.2.2.  Components

   This LFB has only one struct component, the
   IPv6ValidatorStatisticsType, which defines a set of statistics for
   validation process, including the number of bad header packets, the
   number of bad total length packets, and the number of bad hop limit
   packets.

5.2.2.3.  Capabilities

   This LFB does not have a list of capabilities

5.2.2.4.  Events

   This LFB does not have any events specified.

5.3.  IP Forwarding LFBs

   IP Forwarding LFBs are specifically defined to abstract the IP
   forwarding processes.  As definitions for a base LFB library, this
   document restricts its LFB definition scope for IP forwarding jobs
   only to IP unicast forwarding.  LFBs for jobs like IP multicast may
   be defined in future versions of the document.

   A typical IP unicast forwarding job is usually realized by looking up
   some forwarding information table to find some next hop information,
   and then based on the next hop information, forwarding packets to
   specific output ports.  It usually takes two steps to do so, firstly
   to look up a forwarding information table by means of Longest Prefix
   Matching(LPM) rule to find a next hop index, then to use the index to
   look up a next hop information table to find enough information to
   submit packets to output ports.  This document abstracts the
   forwarding processes mainly based on the two steps model.  However,
   there actually exists other models, like one which may only have a
   forwarding information base that have conjoined next hop information
   together with forwarding information.  In this case, if ForCES
   technology is to be applied, some translation work will have to be
   done in FE to translate attributes defined by this document into real
   attributes the implementation has actually applied.

   Based on the IP forwarding abstraction, two kind of typical IP
   unicast forwarding LFBs are defined, Unicast LPM lookup LFB and next
   hop application LFB.  They are further distinguished by IPv4 and IPv6
   protocols.

5.3.1.  IPv4UcastLPM

   The LFB abstracts the process for IPv4 unicast LPM table looking up.

   Input of the LFB always expects to receive IPv4 unicast packets.  An
   IPv4 prefix table is defined as a component for the LFB to provide
   forwarding information for every input packet.  The destination IPv4
   address of every packet is as the index to look up the table with the
   rule of longest prefix matching(LPM).  A hop selector is the matching
   result, which will be output to downstream LFBs as an index for next
   hop information.

   Normal output of the LFB is a singleton output, which will output
   IPv4 unicast packet that has passed the LPM lookup and got a hop
   selector as the lookup result.  The hop selector is associated with
   the packet as a metadatum.  Followed the normal output of the LPM LFB
   is usually a next hop applicator LFB.  The LFB receives packets with
   their next hop IDs and based on the next hop IDs to forward the
   packets.  A hop selector associated with every packet from the normal
   output will directly act as a next hop ID for a next hop applicator
   LFB..

   The LFB is defined to provide some facilities to support users to
   implement equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) or reverse path
   forwarding (RPF).  However, this LFB itself does not provide ECMP or
   RPF.  To implement ECMP or RPF, additional specific LFBs, like a
   specific ECMP LFB, will have to be defined.  This work may be done in
   the future version of the document.

   For the LFB to support ECMP, an ECMP flag is defined in the prefix
   table entries.  When the flag is set to true, it indicates this table
   entry is for ECMP only.  In this case, the hop selector in this table
   entry will be used as an index for a downstream specific ECMP LFB to
   find its correspondent next hop IDs.  When ECMP is applied, it will
   usually get multiple next hops information.

   To distinguish normal output from ECMP case output, a specific ECMP
   output is defined.  A packet, which has passed through prefix table
   entry lookup with true ECMP flag, will always output from this port,
   with the hop selector being its lookup result.  The output will
   usually directly go to a downstream ECMP processing LFB.  In the ECMP
   LFB, based on the hop selector, multiple next hop IDs may be found,
   and more ECMP algorithms may be applied to optimize the route.  As
   the result of the ECMP LFB, it will output optimized one or multiple
   next hop IDs to its downstream LFB that is usually a next hop
   applicator LFB.

   For the LFB to support RPF, a default route flag is defined in the



Wang, et al.            Expires December 4, 2011               [Page 51]

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


   prefix table entry.  When set true, the prefix entry is identified as
   a default route, and also as a forbidden route for RPF.  To implement
   various RPF, one or more specific LFBs have to be defined.  This job
   may be done for the future version of the library.

   An exception output is defined to allow some exceptional packets to
   output here.  Exceptions include cases like packets can not find any
   routes by the prefix table.

   There are also some other components defined in the LFB for various
   purposes.  See section 6 for detailed XML definitions of the LFB.

5.3.2.  IPv4NextHop

   This LFB abstracts the process of next hop information application to
   IPv4 packets.

   The LFB receives an IPv4 packet with an associated next hop ID, and
   uses the ID to look up a next hop table to find an appropriate output
   port from the LFB.  Simultaneously, the LFB also implements TTL
   operation and checksum recalculation of every IPv4 packet received.

   Input of the LFB is a singleton one which expects to receive IPv4
   unicast packets and hop selector metadata from an upstream LFB.
   Usually, the upstream LFB is directly an IPv4UnicastLPM LFB_while it
   is possible some other upstream LFB may be applied.  For instance,
   when ECMP is supported, the upstream LFB may be some specific ECMP
   LFB.

   The next hop ID in hop selector metadata of a packet is then used as
   an index to look up a next hop table defined in the LFB.  Via this
   table and the next hop index, important information for forwarding
   the packet is found.  Every next hop table entry includes the
   following information:

      output logical port ID, which will be used by downstream LFBs to
      find proper output port.

      next hop option, which decides if packets with next hop of this
      table entry are destinated to locally attached hosts or not.
      Locally attached hosts are hosts in the same subnet with this
      router.  Next hop option is marked as 'forwarded to locally
      attached host' if the next hop entry is for locally attached hosts
      delivery.  All other next hop entry will be marked with 'normal
      forwarding'.  If a data packet passes through next hop entries
      with its next hop option marked with forwarded to locally attached
      host, the next hop IP address metadata associated with the data
      packet when output from the LFB will be forced to set to the



Wang, et al.            Expires December 4, 2011               [Page 52]

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


      destination IP address of the data packet.  If a data packet
      passes through a next hop entry with its option being normal
      forwarding, the next hop IP address metadata at output will be set
      to the next hop IP address as indicated by this next hop entry.
      Advantage to define this next hop option for locally attached
      hosts is, in this way, the next hop entry number may be greatly
      reduced in the case there are a vast number of locally attached
      hosts.

      next hop IP address, which will be used by downstream LFB to find
      proper output port IP address for this packet.  Note that when
      next hop option is set to 'forwarded to locally attached host',
      this entry field becomes invalid.  In this case the next hop IP
      address is assigned directly by destination IP address of the data
      packet pass through this entry check.

      encapsulation output index, which is used by data packet to find
      proper output of this LFB.  Usually, this index can be used to
      indicate which encapsulation followed the LFB may be applied to
      data packets pass through this next hop entry check and to
      classify the packets to different instance of a group output port.
      Moreover, this index can also be used to purely indicate output
      port instance to act as a classifier based on next hop IDs.  For
      instance, a next hop table entry can be defined with its
      encapsulation output index being directed to an output port which
      is followed with LFBs that will redirect data packets to Control
      Element(CE).  A next hop entry can also be defined for some data
      packets that need special local processing of the Forwarding
      Element(FE).  In this case it is not really acting as an
      encapsulation index, rather a pure output index.

   As a result, the LFB is defined with two output ports.  One is for
   success output and another is for exception output.  Success output
   is a group output, with an index to indicate which output instance in
   the group is adopted.  The index is exactly the encapsulation output
   index described above.  Downstream LFBs connected to the success
   output group may be various LFBs for encapsulation like LFBs for
   Ethernet encapsulation and for PPP encapsulation, various LFBs for
   local processing, and LFBs for redirecting packets to CE for
   processing.  Next hop table uses the encapsulation output index to
   indicate which port instance in the output group a packet should go.

   Every port instance of the success output group will produce metadata
   of output logical port ID and next hop IP address for every output
   packet.  These metadata will be used by downstream LFBs to further
   implementing forwarding or local processing.  Note that for next hop
   option marked as local host processing, the next hop IP address
   metadata for the packet is exactly substituted with the destination

   IP address of the packet.

   The exception output of the LFB is a singleton output.  It outputs
   packets with exceptional cases.  An exception ID further indicates
   the exception reasons.  Exception may happen when a hop selector is
   found invalid, or ICMP packets need to be generated (Editorial note:
   more discussions here), etc.  The exception ID is also produced as a
   metadata by the output to be transmitted to a downstream LFB.

   There are also some other components defined in the LFB for various
   purposes.  See section 6 for detailed XML definitions of the LFB.

5.3.3.  IPv6UcastLPM

   The LFB abstracts the process for IPv6 unicast LPM table looking up.

   Definitions of this IPv6UcastLPM LFB is very identical to
   IPv4UcastLPM LFB except that all IP addresses related are changed
   from IPv4 addresses to IPv6 addresses.  See section 6 for detailed
   XML definitions of this LFB.

5.3.4.  IPv6NextHop

   This LFB abstracts the process of next hop information application to
   IPv6 packets.

   Definitions of this IPv6NextHop LFB is very identical to IPv4NextHop
   LFB except that all IP addresses related are changed from IPv4
   addresses to IPv6 addresses.  See section 6 for detailed XML
   definitions of this LFB.

5.4.  Redirect LFBs

   Redirect LFBs abstract data packets transportation process between CE
   and FE.  Some packets output from some LFBs may have to be delivered
   to CE for further processing, and some packets generated by CE may
   have to be delivered to FE and further to some specific LFBs for data
   path processing.  According to RFC 5810 [RFC5810], data packets and
   their associated metadata are encapsulated in ForCES redirect message
   for transportation between CE and FE.  We define two LFBs to abstract
   the process, a RedirectIn LFB and a RedirectOut LFB.  Usually, in an
   LFB topology of an FE, only one RedirectIn LFB instance and one
   RedirectOut LFB instance exist.

5.4.1.  RedirectIn

   A RedirectIn LFB abstracts the process for CE to inject data packets
   into FE LFB topology so as to input data packets into FE data paths.

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


   From LFB topology point of view, the RedirectIn LFB acts as a source
   point for data packets coming from CE, therefore the RedirectIn LFB
   is defined with only one output, while without any input.

   Output of the RedirectIn LFB is defined as a group output.  Packets
   produced by the output will have arbitrary frame types decided by CE
   which generates the packets.  Possible frames may include IPv4, IPv6,
   or ARP protocol packets.  CE may associate some metadata to indicate
   the frame types.  CE may also associate other metadata to data
   packets to indicate various information on the packets.  Among them,
   there MUST exist a 'RedirectIndex' metadata, which is an integer
   acting as an index.  When CE transmits the metadata and a binging
   packet to a RedirectIn LFB, the LFB will read the metadata and output
   the packet to one of its group output port instance, whose port index
   is just as indicated by the metadata.  Detailed XML definition of the
   metadata is in the XML for base type library as in Section 4.4.

   All metadata from CE other than the 'RedirectIndex' metadata will
   output from the RedirectIn LFB along with their binding packets.
   Note that, a packet without a 'RedirectIndex' metadata associated
   will be dropped by the LFB.

   There is no component defined for current version of RedirectIn LFB.
   Detailed XML definitions of the LFB can be found in Section 6.

5.4.2.  RedirectOut

   A RedirectOut LFB abstracts the process for LFBs in FE to deliver
   data packets to CE.  From LFB topology point of view, the RedirectOut
   LFB acts as a sink point for data packets going to CE, therefore the
   RedirectOut LFB is defined with only one input, while without any
   output.

   Input of the RedirectOut LFB is defined as a singleton input, but it
   is capable of receiving packets from multiple LFBs by multiplexing
   the singleton input.  Packets expected by the input will have
   arbitrary frame types.  All metadata associated with the input
   packets will be delivered to CE via a ForCES protocol redirect
   message [RFC5810].  The input will expect all types of metadata.

   There is no component defined for current version of RedirectOut LFB.
   Detailed XML definitions of the LFB can be found in Section 6.

5.5.1.  BasicMetadataDispatch

   A basic medatata dispatch LFB is defined to abstract a process in
   which a packet is dispatched to some path based on its associated
   metadata value.

   The LFB is with a singleton input.  Packets of arbitrary frame types
   can input into the LFB.  Whereas, every input packet is required to
   be associated with a metadata that will be used by the LFB to do
   dispatch.  If a packet is not associated with such metadata, the
   packet will be dropped inside the LFB.

   A group of output is defined to output packets according to a
   MetaDispatchTable as defined a component in the LFB.  The table
   contains the fields of a metadata ID, a metadata value, and an output
   port index.  A packet, if it is associated with a metadata with the
   metadata ID, will be output to the group port instance with the index
   corresponding to the metadata value in the table.  The metadata value
   ussed by the table is required with an interger data type.  This
   means this LFB currently only allow a metadata with an interger value
   to be used for dispatch.

   Moreover, the LFB is defined with only one metadata adopted for
   dispatch, i.e., the metadata ID in the dispatch table is always the
   same for all table rows.

   A more complex metadata dispatch LFB may be defined in future version
   of the library.  In that LFB, multiple tuples of metadata may be
   adopted to dispatch packets.

5.5.2.  GenericScheduler

   There exist various kinds of scheduling strategies with various
   implementations.  As a base LFB library, this document only defines a
   preliminary generic scheduler LFB for abstracting a simple scheduling
   process.  The generic scheduler LFB is the one.  Users may use this
   LFB as a basic scheduler LFB to further construct more complex
   scheduler LFBs by means of inheritance as described in RFC 5812
   [RFC5812].

   The LFB describes scheduling process in the following model:

   o  It is with a group input and expects packets with arbitrary frame
      types to arrive for scheduling.  The group input is capable of
      multiple input port instances.  Each port instance may be
      connected to different upstream LFB output.  No metadata is
      expected for each input packet.

Internet-Draft             ForCES LFB Library                  June 2011


   o  Multiple queues reside at the input side, with every input port
      instance connected to one queue.

   o  Every queue is marked with a queue ID, and the queue ID is exactly
      the same as the index of corresponding input port instance.

   o  Scheduling disciplines are applied to all queues and also all
      packets in the queues.

   o  Scheduled packets are output from a singleton output port of the
      LFB.

   Two LFB components are defined to further describe above model.  A
   scheduling discipline component is defined for CE to specify a
   scheduling discipline to the LFB.  Currently defined scheduling
   disciplines only include FIFO and round robin(RR).  For FIFO, we
   limit above model that when a FIFO discipline is applied, it is
   require that there is only one input port instance for the group
   input.  If user accidentally defines multiple input port instances
   for FIFO scheduling, only packets in the input port with lowest port
   index will be scheduled to output port, and all packets in other
   input port instances will just ignored.

   We specify that if the generic scheduler LFB is defined only one
   input port instance, the default scheduling discipline is FIFO.  If
   the LFB is defined with more than one input port instances, the
   default scheduling discipline is round robin (RR).

   A current queue depth component is defined to allow CE to query every
   queue status of the scheduler.  Using the queue ID as the index, CE
   can query every queue for its used length in unit of packets or
   bytes.

   Several capabilities are defined for the LFB.  A queue number limit
   is defined which limits the scheduler maximum supported queue number,
   which is also the maximum number of input port instances.  Capability
   of disciplines supported provides scheduling discipline types
   supported by the FE to CE.  Queue length limit provides the
   capability of storage ability for every queue.

   More complex scheduler LFB may be defined with more complex
   scheduling discipline by succeeding this LFB.  For instance, a
   priority scheduler LFB may be defined only by inheriting this LFB and
   define a component to indicate priorities for all input queues.

   See Section 6 for detailed XML definition for this LFB.

7.  LFB Class Use Cases

   This section demonstrates examples on how the LFB classes defined by
   the Base LFB library in Section 6 are applied to achieve typical
   router functions.

   As mentioned in the overview section, typical router functions can be
   categorized in short into the following functions:

   o  IP forwarding

   o  address resolution

   o  ICMP

   o  network management

   o  running routing protocol

   To achieve the functions, processing paths organized by the LFB
   classes with their interconnections should be established in FE.  In
   general, CE controls and manages the processing paths by use of the
   ForCES protocol.

   Note that LFB class use cases shown in this section are only as
   examples to demonstrate how typical router functions can be
   implemented with the defined base LFB library.  Users and
   implementers should not be limited by the examples.

7.1.  IP Forwarding

11.  Security Considerations

   These definitions if used by an FE to support ForCES create
   manipulable entities on the FE.  Manipulation of such objects can
   produce almost unlimited effects on the FE.  FEs should ensure that
   only properly authenticated ForCES protocol participants are
   performing such manipulations.  Thus the security issues with this
   protocol are defined in the ForCES protocol [RFC5810].

Internet-Draft       ForCES Applicability Statement         October 2009


1.  Purpose

   The purpose of the ForCES Applicability Statement is to capture the
   intent of the ForCES protocol [I-D.ietf-forces-protocol] designers as
   to how the protocol could be used (in conjunction with the ForCES
   model [I-D.ietf-forces-model]).


2.  Overview

   The ForCES protocol defines a standard framework and mechanism for
   the exchange of information between the logically separate
   functionality of the control and data forwarding planes of IP routers
   and similar devices.  It focuses on the communication necessary for
   separation of control plane functionality such as routing protocols,
   signaling protocols, and admission control from data forwarding plane
   per-packet activities such as packet forwarding, queuing, and header
   editing.

   This document defines the applicability of the ForCES mechanisms.  It
   describes types of configurations and settings where ForCES is most
   appropriately applied.  This document also describes scenarios and
   configurations where ForCES would not be appropriate for use.


3.  Terminology

   A set of terminology associated with ForCES is defined in [3, 4].
   That terminology is reused here and the reader is directed to [3, 4]
   for the following definitions:

   o CE: Control Element.

   o FE: Forwarding Element.

   o ForCES: ForCES protocol.

   o TML: Transport Mapping Layer.


4.  Applicability to IP Networks

   The purpose of this section is to list the areas of ForCES
   applicability in IP network devices.  Relatively low end routing
   systems may be implemented on simple hardware which performs both
   control and packet forwarding functionality.  ForCES may not make
   sense for such devices.

Internet-Draft       ForCES Applicability Statement         October 2009


   Higher end routing systems typically distribute work amongst
   interface processing elements, and these devices (FEs) therefore need
   to communicate with the control element(s) to perform their job.
   ForCES provides a standard way to do this communication.

   The remainder of this section lists the applicable services which
   ForCES may support, applicable FE functionality, applicable CE-FE
   link scenarios, and applicable topologies in which ForCES may be
   deployed.

4.1.  Applicable Services

   In this section we describe the applicability of ForCES for the
   following control-forwarding plane services:

   o Discovery, Capability Information Exchange

   o Topology Information Exchange

   o Configuration

   o Routing Exchange

   o QoS Exchange

   o Security Exchange

   o Filtering Exchange

   o Encapsulation/Tunneling Exchange

   o NAT and Application-level Gateways

   o Measurement and Accounting

   o Diagnostics

   o CE Redundancy or CE Failover

4.1.1.  Discovery, Capability Information Exchange

   Discovery is the process by which CEs and FEs learn of each other's
   existence.  ForCES assumes that CEs and FEs already know sufficient
   information to begin communication in a secure manner.  The ForCES
   protocol is only applicable after CEs and FEs have found each other.
   ForCES makes no assumption about whether discovery was performed
   using a dynamic protocol or merely static configuration.




Crouch, et al.           Expires April 13, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       ForCES Applicability Statement         October 2009


   During the discovery phase, CEs and FEs exchange capability
   information with each other.  For example, the FEs express the number
   of interface ports they provide, as well as the static and
   configurable attributes of each port.

   In addition to initial configuration, the CEs and FEs also exchange
   dynamic configuration changes using ForCES.  For example, FEs
   asynchronously inform the CE of an increase/decrease in available
   resources or capabilities on the FE.

4.1.2.  Topology Information Exchange

   In this context, topology information relates to how the FEs are
   interconnected with each other with respect to packet forwarding.
   Topology discovery is outside the scope of the ForCES protocol.  An
   implementation can choose its own method of topology discovery(for
   example use a standard topology discovery protocol like LLDP, BFD;or
   apply a static topology configuration policy).Once the topology is
   established, ForCES protocol may be used to transmit the resulting
   information to the CE.

4.1.3.  Configuration

   ForCES is used to perform FE configuration.  For example, CEs set
   configurable FE attributes such as IP addresses, etc. for their
   interfaces.

4.1.4.  Routing Exchange

   ForCES may be used to deliver packet forwarding information resulting
   from CE routing calculations.  For example, CEs may send forwarding
   table updates to the FEs, so that they can make forwarding decisions.
   FEs may inform the CE in the event of a forwarding table miss.

4.1.5.  QoS Exchange

   ForCES may be used to exchange QoS capabilities between CEs and FEs.
   For example, an FE may express QoS capabilities to the CE.  Such
   capabilities might include metering, policing, shaping, and queuing
   functions.  The CE may use ForCES to configure these capabilities.

4.1.6.  Security Exchange

   ForCES may be used to exchange Security information between CEs and
   FEs.  For example, the FE may use ForCES to express the types of
   encryption that it is capable of using in an IPsec tunnel.  The CE
   may use ForCES to configure such a tunnel.

Internet-Draft       ForCES Applicability Statement         October 2009


4.1.7.  Filtering Exchange and Firewalls

   ForCES may be used to exchange filtering information.  For example,
   FEs may use ForCES to express the filtering functions such as
   classification and action that they can perform, and the CE may
   configure these capabilities.

4.1.8.  Encapsulation, Tunneling Exchange

   ForCES may be used to exchange encapsulation capabilities of an FE,
   such as tunneling, and the configuration of such capabilities.

4.1.9.  NAT and Application-level Gateways

   ForCES may be used to exchange configuration information for Network
   Address Translators.  Whilst ForCES is not specifically designed for
   the configuration of application-level gateway functionality, this
   may be in scope for some types of application-level gateways.

4.1.10.  Measurement and Accounting

   ForCES may be used to exchange configuration information regarding
   traffic measurement and accounting functionality.  In this area,
   ForCES may overlap somewhat with functionality provided by
   alternative network management mechanisms such as SNMP.  In some
   cases ForCES may be used to convey information to the CE to be
   reported externally using SNMP.

4.1.11.  Diagnostics

   ForCES may be used for CEs and FEs to exchange diagnostic
   information.  For example, an FE can send self-test results to the
   CE.

4.1.12.  CE Redundancy or CE Failover

   CE failover and redundancy are out of scope in the initial version of
   ForCES protocol.  Basic mechanisms for CE redundancy/failover are not
   presently implemented.  Broad concepts such as implementing CE
   Redundancy, CE Failover, and CE-CE communication, while not precluded
   by the ForCES architecture, are considered outside the scope of
   ForCES protocol.  ForCES protocol is designed to handle CE- FE
   communication, and is not intended for CE-CE communication.

4.2.  CE-FE Link Capability

   When using ForCES, the bandwidth of the CE-FE link is a
   consideration, and cannot be ignored.  For example, sending a full



Crouch, et al.           Expires April 13, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       ForCES Applicability Statement         October 2009


   routing table is reasonable over a high bandwidth link, but could be
   non-trivial over a lower-bandwidth link.  ForCES should be
   sufficiently future-proof to be applicable in scenarios where routing
   tables grow to several orders of magnitude greater than their current
   size.  However, we also note that not all IP routers need full
   routing tables.

4.3.  CE/FE Locality

   ForCES is intended for environments where one of the following
   applies:

   o The control interconnect is some form of local bus, switch, or LAN,
   where reliability is high, closely controlled, and not susceptible to
   external disruption that does not also affect the CEs and/or FEs.

   o The control interconnect shares fate with the FE's forwarding
   function.  Typically this is because the control connection is also
   the FE's primary packet forwarding connection, and so if that link
   goes down, the FE cannot forward packets anyway.

   The key guideline is that the reliability of the device should not be
   significantly reduced by the separation of control and forwarding
   functionality.

   Taking this into account, ForCES is applicable in the following CE/FE
   localities:

   o single box NE: chassis with multiple CEs and FEs setup.  ForCES is
   applicable in localities consisting of control and forwarding
   elements which are components in the same physical box.

   Example: a network element with a single control blade, and one or
   more forwarding blades, all present in the same chassis and sharing
   an interconnect such as Ethernet or PCI.  In this locality, the
   majority of the data traffic being forwarded typically does not
   traverse the same links as the ForCES control traffic.

   o multiple boxes: separated CE and FE where physical locality could
   be same rack, room, building, or long distance which could span
   across continents and oceans.  ForCES is applicable in localities
   consisting of control and forwarding elements which are separated by
   a single hop or multiple hops in the network.


5.  Security Considerations

   The ForCES architecture allows for a variety of security levels[6].



Crouch, et al.           Expires April 13, 2010                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       ForCES Applicability Statement         October 2009


   When operating under a secured physical environment, or for other
   operational concerns (in some cases performance issues) the operator
   may turn off all the security functions between CE and FE.  When the
   operator makes a decision to secure the path between the FE and CE
   then the operator chooses from one of the options provided by the
   TML.  Security choices provided by the TML take effect during the
   pre-association phase of the ForCES protocol.  An operator may choose
   to use all, some or none of the security services provided by the TML
   in a CE-FE connection.  A ForCES NE is required to provide CE/FE node
   authentication services, and may provide message integrity and
   confidentially services.  The NE may provide these services by
   employing IPSEC or TLS depending on the choice of TML used in the
   deployment of the NE.


6.  ForCES Manageability

   From the management perspective, an NE can be viewed in at least two
   ways.  From one perspective, it is a single network element,
   specifically a router that needs to be managed in essentially the
   same way any router is managed.  From another perspective element
   management can view the individual entities and interfaces that make
   up a ForCES NE.

6.1.  NE as an atomic element

   From the ForCES requirements RFC 3654, Section 4, point 4:

   A NE must support the appearance of a single functional device.

   As a single functional device a ForCES NE runs protocols and each of
   the protocols has it own existing manageability aspects that are
   documented elsewhere.  As a router it would also have a configuration
   interface.  When viewed in this manner, the NE is controlled as a
   single routing entity and no new management beyond what is already
   available for routers and routing protocols would be required for a
   ForCES NE.

6.2.  NE as composed of manageable elements

   When viewed as a decomposed set of elements from the management
   perspective, the ForCES NE is divided into a set of one of more
   Control Elements, Forwarding Elements and the interfaces between
   them.  The interface functionality between the CE and the FE is
   provided by the ForCES protocol.  As with all IETF protocols a MIB is
   provided for the purposes of managing the protocol.

   Additionally the architecture makes provision for configuration



Crouch, et al.           Expires April 13, 2010                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       ForCES Applicability Statement         October 2009


   control of the individual CEs and FEs.  This is handled by elements
   named FE manager (FEM) and the CE manager (CEM).  Specifically from
   the ForCES requirements RFC [RFC 3654], Section 4, point 4:

   However, external entities (e.g., FE managers and CE managers) may
   have direct access to individual ForCES protocol elements for
   providing information to transition them from the pre-association to
   post-association phase.

6.3.  ForCES Protocol MIB

   The ForCES MIB [I-D.ietf-forces-mib] is a primarily read-only MIB
   that captures information related to the ForCES protocol.  This
   includes state information about the associations between CE(s) and
   FE(s) in the NE.

   The ForCES MIB does not include information that is specified in
   other MIBs, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.

   More specifically, the information in the ForCES MIB relative to
   associations includes:

   - identifiers of the elements in the association

   - state of the association

   - configuration parameters of the association

   - statistics of the association

6.3.1.  MIB Management of an FE

   While it is possible to manage a FE from a element manager, several
   requirements relating to this have been included in the ForCES
   Requirements.

   From the ForCES Requirements [RFC 3654], Section 4, point 14:

   1.  The ability for a management tool (e.g., SNMP) to be used to read
   (but not change) the state of FE should not be precluded.

   2.  It must not be possible for management tools (e.g., SNMP, etc) to
   change the state of a FE in a manner that affects overall NE behavior
   without the CE being notified.

   The ForCES Requirements [RFC 3654], Section 5.7, goes further in
   discussing the manner in which FEs should handle management requests
   that are specifically directed to the FE:



Crouch, et al.           Expires April 13, 2010                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       ForCES Applicability Statement         October 2009


   RFC 1812 [2] also dictates that "Routers must be manageable by SNMP".
   In general, for the post-association phase, most external management
   tasks (including SNMP) should be done through interaction with the CE
   in order to support the appearance of a single functional device.
   Therefore, it is recommended that an SNMP agent be implemented by CEs
   and that the SNMP messages received by FEs be redirected to their
   CEs.  AgentX framework defined in RFC 2741 ([6]) may be applied here
   such that CEs act in the role of master agent to process SNMP
   protocol messages while FEs act in the role of subagent to provide
   access to the MIB objects residing on FEs.  AgentX protocol messages
   between the master agent (CE) and the subagent (FE) are encapsulated
   and transported via ForCES, just like data packets from any other
   application layer protocols.

6.4.  The FEM and CEM

   Though out of scope for the initial ForCES specification effort, the
   ForCES architecture include two entities, the CE Manager (CEM) and
   the FE Manager (FEM).  From the ForCES Protocols Specification
   [I-D.ietf-forces-protocol].

   CE Manager (CEM) - A logical entity responsible for generic CE
   management tasks.  It is particularly used during the pre-association
   phase to determine with which FE(s) a CE should communicate.

   FE Manager (FEM) - A logical entity responsible for generic FE
   management tasks.  It is used during pre-association phase to
   determine with which CE(s) an FE should communicate.

Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                  March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Multi-pair bonding using time-division inverse multiplexing
   (TDIM), a.k.a.  G.Bond/TDIM, is specified in ITU-T G.998.3
   recommendation [G.998.3], which defines a method for bonding (or
   aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels in
   multiple xDSL lines) into a single bi-directional logical link,
   carrying a mix of various traffic streams, e.g.  Ethernet,
   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM).

   The MIB module, defined in this document, provides G.Bond/
   TDIM-specific objects for the management of G.998.3 bonded
   interfaces, extending the common bonding objects specified in GBOND-
   MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   Management Framework for xDSL Bonding [TR-159], defining a management
   model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL
   interfaces.

4.  Relationship to other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB) and G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).

Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                  March 2011


4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A G.Bond/TDIM port is a private case of a Bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/TDIM ports, as
   well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB module

   GBOND-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module defines management
   objects common for all Bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In
   particular it describes the bonding management, bonded port and
   channel configuration, initialization sequence etc.

   Both GBOND-MIB and GBOND-TDIM-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a
   G.Bond/TDIM port.

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   All management objects defined in the GBOND-TDIM-MIB module are
   contained in a single group gBondTdimPort.  This group is further
   split into 6 sub-groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181
   [RFC4181]:

   o  gBondTdimPortNotifications - containing notifications (TDIM
      Service Down/Up).

   o  gBondTdimPortConfTable - containing objects for configuration of a
      G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  gBondTdimPortCapabilityTable - containing objects reflecting
      capability of a G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  gBondTdimPortStatusTable - containing objects providing overall
      status information of a G.Bond/TDIM port, complementing the
      generic status information from the ifTable of IF-MIB and
      gBondFltStatus of GBOND-MIB.

   o  gBondTdimServiceTable - containing objects for configuration and
      status of the services in a G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  gBondTdimPM - containing objects for an OPTIONAL Historical
      Performance Monitoring (PM) of a G.Bond/TDIM port.

5.2.  Link Protection Configuration

   G.Bond/TDIM specification allows an optional Forward Error Correction
   (FEC) and Interleaver block, which, if supported and enabled,
   provides a degree of protection against micro-interruptions, alien
   noise, and even individual Bonding Channel Entity (BCE) failures,
   a.k.a. cut-line protection.

   Management objects in the gBondTdimPortConfTable can be used to
   configure and quiery the FEC and Interleaver function of the G.Bond/
   TDIM port.

5.3.  Service Configuration

   Unlike the other two xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding schemes (G.Bond/ATM and
   G.Bond/Ethernet), which send the information required for reassembly
   of the fragmented data along with the data, G.Bond/TDIM is a
   synchronous scheme, requiring both ends to know the data distribution
   tables before any actual data transfer can happen.

   Management objects in the gBondTdimPortConfTable
   (gBondTdimAdminServices), gBondTdimServiceTable and
   gBondTdimOperServiceTable can be used to configure and quiery the
   configuration of services transported via the G.Bond/TDIM link.  The
   services may be configured independently of the link state (i.e. in-
   and out-of-service), as G.998.3 communicates changes in the service
   configuration via specific Bonding Communication Channel (BCC)
   messages, switching both ends of the link to the new configuration
   synchronously.

   There can be up to 60 active services defined on a G.Bond/TDIM link.
   This MIB module provides an ability to define up to 255 services via
   the gBondTdimServiceTable, with each row representing a possible
   service, and then set the actual service configuration using the
   gBondTdimAdminServices object (a byte-vector of service indices),
   listing the active services in order of their position in the G.Bond/
   TDIM frame.  This design allows one to easily modify service drop
   priority, which directly corresponds to the service position.

   The actual list of services is provided via read-only
   gBondTdimOperServiceTable, where each entry's index corresponds to
   the service position, starting from index 1 for the first entry, 2
   for the second entry etc., providing an easy service navigation for a
   management application using GET-NEXT (instead of counting bytes in
   the gBondTdimAdminServices object).

   The service configuration can only be changed on a BTU-C side.

Internet-Draft               G.Bond/TDIM MIB                  March 2011


   When configuring the services, please bear in mind that the sum of
   all the services' bandwidth SHOULD be less or equal to the target
   data rate of the bonded link.  Note that G.Bond/TDIM links are
   symmetrical, i.e. their upstream data rate equals to the downstream
   data rate.

5.3.1.  Management of TDM Services and service drop priority during
        bandwidth degradation

   G.Bond/TDIM protocol provides an ability to map TDM services into the
   TDIM bonded link directly, without any additional overhead.  It
   addresses only structure-agnostic TDM transport, disregarding any
   structure that may be imposed on these streams, in particular the
   structure imposed by the standard TDM framing [G.704].

   During bandwidth degradation services with a lower priority are
   impaired or dropped first.  Synchronous services (fractional DS1/E1,
   clear channel E1/T1, T3/E3, clock) positioned in the beginning of the
   G.Bond/TDIM frame, have higher priority than asynchronous services
   (Ethernet, ATM, GFP encapsulated), positioned farther away.  Within
   the services of the same type, those with lower position (index) have
   higher priority.

5.3.2.  Service Notifications

   This MIB module provides specific Up/Down notifications
   (gBondTdimServiceUp/gBondTdimServiceDown) for each of the configured
   services.  During bandwidth degradation a number of services may be
   suspended (dropped) simultaneously, according to their drop priority
   (position in the service list).  Please note that it is possible for
   a higher priority service to be dropped before a lower priority one.
   For example, suppose there are two services configured on a 2 Mbps
   G.Bond/TDIM link: a T1 service (gBondTdimServiceType with a value of
   ds1, with a bandwidth requirement of 1.5 Mbps) and an Ethernet
   service with a size of 0.5 Mbps.  When the actual link bandwidth is
   reduced to 1.4 Mbps, the T1 service with a gBondTdimServicePosition
   value of 1 would be dropped, while the Ethernet service with a
   gBondTdimServicePosition value of 2 would remain up.

5.4.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL performance monitoring counters, thresholds and history
   buckets (interval-counters), similar to those defined in [TR-159] are
   implemented using the textual conventions defined in the HC-PerfHist-
   TC-MIB [RFC3705].  The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of
   the textual conventions found in PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593].

   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen

   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each one
   day intervals SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when a G.Bond TDIM port is reinitialized, but
   rather only when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under
   specific request outside the scope of this MIB module).

     STATUS       current
     DESCRIPTION
       "A unique value, greater than zero, for each Service defined
       in the managed G.Bond/TDIM port.
       It is RECOMMENDED that values are assigned contiguously
       starting from 1. The value for each Service MUST remain
       constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
       network management system to the next re-initialization."

   GBondTdimServiceIndexList ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     DISPLAY-HINT "1d:"
     STATUS       current
     DESCRIPTION
       "This textual convention represents a continuous ordered list of
       all the services defined for the managed G.Bond/TDIM port.
       The value of this object is a concatenation of zero or more (up
       to 60) octets, where each octet contains an 8-bit
       GBondTdimServiceIndex value, identifying a particular service.
       An octet's position reflects the associated service position
       and its priority in the G.Bond/TDIM frame, with 1st octet being
       the 1st service of highest priority.

       A zero-length octet string is object-specific and MUST
       therefore be defined as part of the description of any object
       that uses this syntax. Examples of the usage of a zero-length
       value might include situations where an object using this
       textual convention is irrelevant for a specific G.Bond/TDIM port
       type or that no services have been defined for this port."

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in the GBOND-TDIM-MIB
   module that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.
   Most objects are writable only when the link is down.  Writing to
   these objects can have potentially disruptive effects on network
   operation, for example:

   o  Changing of gBondTdimAdminServices object MAY lead to a potential
      service disruption, by changing a particular service' position
      (therefore changing its drop priority) or even removing the
      service from the link altogether.

   o  Changing of gBondTdimServiceTable configuration parameters (e.g.
      gBondTdimServiceType or gBondTdimServiceSize) MAY lead to a
      potential service impairment, for example a TDM service would be
      dropped if there is not enough actual bandwidth on the bonded link
      to support this service.

   o  Changing of gBondTdimPortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.
      gBondTdimFecAdminState) MAY lead to anything from link quality and
      rate degradation to a complete link initialization failure.

   The user of the GBOND-TDIM-MIB module must therefore be aware that
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in the GBOND-TDIM-MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in
   some environments since, collectively, they provide information about
   the performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.

   In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values

   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   An object identifier for gBondTdimMIB MODULE-IDENTITY SHALL be
   allocated by IANA [1] in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree, before this
   document is published as an RFC.

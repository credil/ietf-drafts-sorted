    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This draft describes a QoS model (QOSM) for NSIS QoS signaling layer
      protocol (QoS-NSLP) application based on ITU-T Recommendation Y.1541
      Network QoS Classes and related signaling requirements. <xref
      target="Y.1541"></xref> currently specifies 8 classes of Network
      Performance objectives, and the Y.1541-QOSM extensions include
      additional QSPEC parameters and QOSM processing guidelines. The
      extensions are based on standardization work in the ITU-T on QoS
      signaling requirements <xref target="Y.1541"></xref> <xref
      target="TRQ-QoS-SIG"></xref> <xref target="E.361"></xref>.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp"></xref> defines message types
      and control information for the QoS-NSLP generic to all QOSMs. A QOSM is
      a defined mechanism for achieving QoS as a whole. The specification of a
      QOSM includes a description of its QSPEC parameter information, as well
      as how that information should be treated or interpreted in the network.
      The QSPEC <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec"></xref> contains a set of
      parameters and values describing the requested resources. It is opaque
      to the QoS-NSLP and similar in purpose to the TSpec, RSpec and AdSpec
      specified in <xref target="RFC2205"></xref> <xref
      target="RFC2210"></xref> . The QSPEC object contains the QoS parameters
      defined by the QOSM. A QOSM provides a specific set of parameters to be
      carried in the QSPEC. At each QoS NSIS element (QNE), the QSPEC contents
      are interpreted by the resource management function (RMF) for purposes
      of policy control and traffic control, including admission control and
      configuration of the scheduler.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Summary of ITU-T Recommendations Y.1541 &amp; Signaling Requirements ">
      <t>As stated above, <xref target="Y.1541"></xref> is a specification of
      standardized QoS classes for IP networks (a summary of these classes is
      given below). Section 7 of <xref target="TRQ-QoS-SIG"></xref> specifies
      signaling features needed to achieve end-to-end QoS in IP networks, with
      Y.1541 QoS classes as a basis. <xref target="Y.1541"></xref> recommends
      a flexible allocation of the end-to-end performance objectives (e.g.,
      delay) across networks, rather than a fixed per-network allocation. NSIS
      protocols already address most of the requirements, this document
      identifies additional QSPEC parameters and processing requirements
      needed to support the Y.1541 QOSM.</t>

      <section title="Y.1541 Classes">
        <t><xref target="Y.1541"></xref> proposes grouping services into QoS
        classes defined according to the desired QoS performance objectives.
        These QoS classes support a wide range of user applications. The
        classes group objectives for one-way IP packet delay, IP packet delay
        variation, IP packet loss ratio, etc., where the parameters themselves
        are defined in <xref target="Y.1540"></xref>. Classes 0 and 1 might be
        implemented using the DiffServ EF PHB, and support interactive
        real-time applications. Classes 2, 3, and 4 might be implemented using
        the DiffServ AFxy PHB Group, and support data transfer applications
        with various degrees of interactivity. Class 5 generally corresponds
        to the DiffServ Default PHB, has all the QoS parameters unspecified
        consistent with a best-effort service. Classes 6 and 7 provide support
        for extremely loss-sensitive user applications, such as high quality
        digital television, TDM circuit emulation, and high capacity file
        transfers using TCP. These classes are intended to serve as a basis
        for agreements between end-users and service providers, and between
        service providers. They support a wide range of user applications
        including point-to-point telephony, data transfer, multimedia
        conferencing, and others. The limited number of classes supports the
        requirement for feasible implementation, particularly with respect to
        scale in global networks.</t>

        <t>The QoS classes apply to a packet flow, where <xref
        target="Y.1541"></xref> defines a packet flow as the traffic
        associated with a given connection or connectionless stream having the
        same source host, destination host, class of service, and session
        identification. The characteristics of each Y.1451 QoS class are
        summarized here:</t>

        <t>Class 0: Real-time, highly interactive applications, sensitive to
        jitter. Mean delay upper bound is 100 ms, delay variation is less than
        50 ms, and loss ratio is less than 10^-3. Application examples include
        VoIP, Video Teleconference.</t>

        <t>Class 1: Real-time, interactive applications, sensitive to jitter.
        Mean delay upper bound is 400 ms, delay variation is less than 50 ms,
        and loss ratio is less than 10^-3. Application examples include VoIP,
        video teleconference.</t>

        <t>Class 2: Highly interactive transaction data. Mean delay upper
        bound is 100 ms, delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is
        less than 10^-3. Application examples include signaling.</t>

        <t>Class 3: Interactive transaction data. Mean delay upper bound is
        400 ms, delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less than
        10^-3. Application examples include signaling.</t>

        <t>Class 4: Low Loss Only applications. Mean delay upper bound is 1s,
        delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less than 10^-3.
        Application examples include short transactions, bulk data, video
        streaming</t>

        <t>Class 5: Unspecified applications with unspecified mean delay,
        delay variation, and loss ratio. Application examples include
        traditional applications of Default IP Networks</t>

        <t>Class 6: Mean delay &lt;= 100 ms, delay variation &lt;= 50 ms, loss
        ratio &lt;= 10^-5. Applications that are highly sensitive to loss,
        such as television transport, high-capacity TCP transfers, and TDM
        circuit emulation.</t>

        <t>Class 7: Mean delay &lt;= 400 ms, delay variation &lt;= 50 ms, loss
        ratio &lt;= 10^-5. Applications that are highly sensitive to loss,
        such as television transport, high-capacity TCP transfers, and TDM
        circuit emulation.</t>

        <t>These classes enable SLAs to be defined between customers and
        network service providers with respect to QoS requirements. The
        service provider then needs to ensure that the requirements are
        recognized and receive appropriate treatment across network
        layers.</t>

        <t>Work is in progress to specify methods for combining local values
        of performance metrics to estimate the performance of the complete
        path. See section 8 of <xref target="Y.1541"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-framework-compagg"></xref>, and <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-spatial-composition"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Y.1541-QOSM Processing Requirements">
        <t><xref target="TRQ-QoS-SIG"></xref> provides the requirements for
        signaling information regarding IP-based QoS at the interface between
        the user and the network (UNI) and across interfaces between different
        networks (NNI). To meet specific network performance requirements
        specified for the Y.1541 QoS classes <xref target="Y.1541"></xref> , a
        network needs to provide specific user plane functionality at UNI and
        NNI interfaces. Dynamic network provisioning at a UNI and/or NNI node
        allows the ability to dynamically request a traffic contract for an IP
        flow from a specific source node to one or more destination nodes. In
        response to the request, the network determines if resources are
        available to satisfy the request and provision the network.</t>

        <t>For implementations to claim compliance with this memo, it MUST be
        possible to derive the following service level parameters as part of
        the process of requesting service:</t>

        <t>a. Y.1541 QoS class, 32 bit integer, range : 0-7</t>

        <t>b. rate (r), octets per second</t>

        <t>c. peak rate (p), octets per second</t>

        <t>d. bucket size (b), octets</t>

        <t>e. maximum packet size (M), octets, IP header + IP payload</t>

        <t>f. DiffServ PHB class <xref target="RFC2475"></xref></t>

        <t>g. admission priority, 32 bit integer, range : 0-2</t>

        <t>Compliant implementations MAY derive the following service level
        parameters as part of the service request process:</t>

        <t>h. peak bucket size (Bp)*, octets, 32 bit floating point number in
        single-precision IEEE floating point format <xref
        target="IEEE754"></xref></t>

        <t>i. restoration priority*, multiple integer values defined in
        Section 3 below</t>

        <t>All parameters except Bp and restoration priority have already been
        specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec"></xref>. These
        additional parameters are defined as</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Bp, The size of the peak-rate bucket in a dual token bucket
            arrangement, essentially setting the maximum length of bursts in

            <t>restoration priority, as defined in Section 3 of this memo</t>
          </list>and their QSPEC Parameter format is specified in Section
        3.</t>

        <t>It MUST be possible to perform the following QoS-NSLP signaling
        functions to meet Y.1541-QOSM requirements:</t>

        <t>a. accumulate delay, delay variation and loss ratio across the
        end-to-end connection, which may span multiple domains</t>

        <t>b. enable negotiation of Y.1541 QoS class across domains.</t>

        <t>c. enable negotiation of delay, delay variation, and loss ratio
        across domains.</t>

        <t>These signaling requirements are supported in <xref

        <t>This parameter has three fields and a reserved area, as defined
        below.</t>

        <t>Restoration Priority Field (8-bit unsigned integer): 3 priority
        values are listed here in the order of lowest priority to highest
        priority:</t>

        <t>0 - best effort</t>

        <t>1 - normal</t>

        <t>2 - high</t>

        <t>These priority values are described in <xref
        target="Y.2172"></xref>, where best effort priority is the same as
        Priority level 3, normal priority is Priority level 2, and high
        priority is the same as Priority level 1. There are several ways to
        elaborate on restoration priority, and the two current parameters are
        described below.</t>

        <t>Time-to-Restore (TTR) Field (4-bit unsigned integer): Total amount
        of time to restore traffic streams belonging to a given restoration
        class impacted by the failure. This time period depends on the
        technology deployed for restoration. A fast recovery period of &lt;
        200 ms is based on current experience with SONET rings and a slower
        recovery period of 2 seconds is suggested in order to enable a voice
        call to recover without being dropped. Accordingly, TTR restoration
        suggested ranges are:</t>

        <t>0 - Unspecified Time-to-Restore</t>

        <t>1 - Best Time-to-Restore: &lt;= 200 ms</t>

        <t>2 - Normal Time-to-Restore &lt;= 2 s</t>

        <t>Extent of Restoration (EOR) Field (4-bit unsigned integer):
        Percentage of traffic belonging to the restoration class that can be
        restored. This percentage depends on the amount of spare capacity
        engineered. All high priority restoration priority traffic, for
        example, may be "guaranteed" at 100% by the service provider. Other
        classes may offer lesser chances for successful restoration. The
        restoration extent for these lower priority classes depend on SLA
        agreements developed between the service provider and the
        customer.</t>

        <t>EOR values are assigned as follows:</t>

        <t>0 - unspecified EOR</t>

        <t>1 - high priority restored at 100%; medium priority restored at
        100%</t>

    <section title="Y.1541-QOSM Considerations and Processing Example">
      <t>In this Section we illustrate the operation of the Y.1541 QOSM, and
      show how current QoS-NSLP and QSPEC functionality is used. No new
      processing capabilities are required to enable the Y.1541 QOSM
      (excluding the two OPTIONAL new parameters specified in Section 3).</t>

      <section title="Deployment Considerations">
        <t><xref target="TRQ-QoS-SIG"></xref> emphasizes the deployment of
        Y.1541 QNEs at the borders of supporting domains. There may be domain
        configurations where interior QNEs are desirable, and the example
        below addresses this possibility.</t>

        <t>QNEs may be Stateful in some limited aspects, but obviously it is
        preferable to deploy stateless QNEs.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicable QSPEC Procedures">
        <t>All procedures defined in section 5.3 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec"></xref> are applicable to this QOSM.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="QNE Processing Rules">
        <t>Section 7 of <xref target="TRQ-QoS-SIG"></xref> describes the
        information processing in Y.1541 QNEs.</t>

        <t>Section 8 of <xref target="Y.1541"></xref> defines the accumulation
        rules for individual performance parameters (e.g., delay, jitter).</t>

        <t>When a QNI specifies the Y.1541 QoS Class number, &lt;Y.1541 QoS
        Class&gt;, it is a sufficient specification of objectives for the
        &lt;Path Latency&gt;, &lt;Path Jitter&gt;, and &lt;Path BER&gt;
        parameters. As described above in section 2, some Y.1541 Classes do
        not set objectives for all the performance parameters above. For
        example, Classes 2, 3, and 4, do not specify an objective for &lt;Path
        Jitter&gt; (referred to as IP Packet Delay Variation). In the case
        that the QoS Class leaves a parameter Unspecified, then that parameter
        need not be included in the accumulation processing.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Processing Example">
        <t>As described in the example given in Section 4.4 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec"></xref> and as illustrated in Figure 3,
        the QoS NSIS initiator (QNI) initiates an end-to-end, inter-domain QoS
        NSLP RESERVE message containing the Initiator QSPEC. In the case of
        the Y.1541 QOSM, the Initiator QSPEC specifies the &lt;Y.1541 QOS
        Class&gt;, &lt;TMOD&gt;, &lt;TMOD Extension&gt;, &lt;Admission
        Priority&gt;, &lt;Restoration Priority&gt;, and perhaps other QSPEC
        parameters for the flow. As described in Section 3, the TMOD extension
        parameter contains the OPTIONAL, Y.1541-QOSM-specific terms;
        restoration priority is also an OPTIONAL, Y.1541-QOSM-specific
        parameter.</t>

        <t>As Figure 3 below shows, the RESERVE message may cross multiple
        domains supporting different QOSMs. In this illustration, the
        initiator QSPEC arrives in an QoS NSLP RESERVE message at the ingress
        node of the local-QOSM domain. As described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp"></xref> and <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec"></xref>, at the ingress edge node of the
        local-QOSM domain, the end-to-end, inter-domain QoS-NSLP message may
        trigger the generation of a local QSPEC, and the initiator QSPEC
        encapsulated within the messages signaled through the local domain.
        The local QSPEC is used for QoS processing in the local-QOSM domain,
        and the Initiator QSPEC is used for QoS processing outside the local
        domain. As specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec"></xref>, if
        any QNE cannot meet the requirements designated by the initiator QSPEC
        to support an optional QSPEC parameter, with the M bit set to zero for
        the parameter, for example, it cannot support the accumulation of
        end-to-end delay with the &lt;Path Latency&gt; parameter, the QNE sets
        the N flag (not supported flag) for the path latency parameter to
        one.</t>

        <t>Also, the Y.1541-QOSM requires negotiation of the &lt;Y.1541 QoS
        Class&gt; across domains. This negotiation can be done with the use of
        the existing procedures already defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp"></xref>. For example, the QNI sets
        &lt;Desired QoS&gt;, &lt;Minimum QoS&gt;, &lt;Available QoS&gt;
        objects to include &lt;Y.1541 QoS Class&gt;, which specifies
        objectives for the &lt;Path Latency&gt;, &lt;Path Jitter&gt;, &lt;Path
        BER&gt; parameters. In the case that the QoS Class leaves a parameter
        Unspecified, then that parameter need not be included in the
        accumulation processing. The QNE/domain SHOULD set the Y.1541 class
        and cumulative parameters, e.g., &lt;Path Latency&gt;, that can be
        achieved in the &lt;QoS Available&gt; object (but not less than
        specified in &lt;Minimum QoS&gt;). This could include, for example,
        setting the &lt;Y.1541 QoS Class&gt; to a lower class than specified
        in &lt;QoS Desired&gt; (but not lower than specified in &lt;Minimum
        QoS&gt;). If the &lt;Available QoS&gt; fails to satisfy one or more of
        the &lt;Minimum QoS&gt; objectives, the QNE/domain notifies the QNI
        and the reservation is aborted. Otherwise, the QNR notifies the QNI of
        the &lt;QoS Available&gt; for the reservation.</t>

        <t>When the available &lt;Y.1541 QoS Class&gt; must be reduced from
        the desired &lt;Y.1541 QoS Class&gt;, say because the delay objective
        has been exceeded, then there is an incentive to respond with an
        available value for delay in the &lt;Path Latency&gt; parameter. If
        the available &lt;Path Latency&gt; is 150 ms (still useful for many
        applications) and the desired QoS is Class 0 (with its 100 ms
        objective), then the response would be that Class 0 cannot be achieved
        and Class 1 is available (with its 400 ms objective). In addition,
        this QOSM allows the response to include an available &lt;Path
        Latency&gt; = 150 ms, making acceptance of the available &lt;Y.1541
        QoS Class&gt; more likely. There are many long paths where the
        propagation delay alone exceeds the Y.1541 Class 0 objective, so this
        feature adds flexibility to commit to exceed the Class 1 objective
        when possible.</t>

        <t>This example illustrates Y.1541-QOSM negotiation of &lt;Y.1541 QoS
        Class&gt; and cumulative parameter values that can be achieved
        end-to-end. The example illustrates how the QNI can use the cumulative
        values collected in &lt;QoS Available&gt; to decide if a lower
        &lt;Y.1541 QoS Class&gt; than specified in &lt;QoS Desired&gt; is
        acceptable.</t>

      <t>The restoration priority parameter raises possibilities for theft of
      service attacks because users could claim an emergency priority for
      their flows without real need, thereby effectively preventing serious
      emergency calls to get through. Several options exist for countering
      such attacks, for example</t>

      <t>- only some user groups (e.g. the police) are authorized to set the
      emergency priority bit</t>

      <t>- any user is authorized to employ the emergency priority bit for
      particular destination addresses (e.g. police or fire departments)</t>

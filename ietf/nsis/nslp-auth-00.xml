	<t>

Signaling layer protocols specified within the NSIS framework may rely
on the GIST (General Internet Signaling Transport) protocol to handle
authorization.  Still, the signaling layer protocol above GIST itself
may require separate authorization to be performed when a node
receives a request for a certain kind of service or resources.  This
draft presents a generic model and object formats for session
authorization within the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocols. The goal of
session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between
network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a
service and to coordinate actions between the signaling and transport
planes.

<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
<xref target="RFC2119" />.
</t>

<t>
The term "NSLP node" (NN) is used to refer to an NSIS node running an
NSLP protocol that can make use of the authorization object discussed in
this document. Currently, this node would run either the QoS or the
NAT/FW NSLP service.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>

The NSIS working group is specifying a suite of protocols for the next
generation in Internet signaling <xref target="RFC4080" />. The design
is based on a generalized transport protocol for signaling applications,
the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) <xref
target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp" />, and various kinds of signaling
applications. Two signaling applications and their NSIS Signaling Layer
Protocol (NSLP) have been designed, a Quality of Service application
(QoS NSLP) <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp" /> and a NAT/firewall
application (NAT/FW) <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw" />.

</t>

<t>

The so far specified basic security architecture for NSIS is based on
a chain-of-trust model, where each GIST hop may chose the appropriate
security protocol, taking into account the signaling application
requirements. For instance, communication between two directly adjacent 
GIST peers may be secured via TCP/TLS. On the one hand this model is 
appropriate for a number of different use cases, and allows the 
signaling applications to leave the handling of security to GIST. 
On the other hand, several sessions of different signaling applications
are then multiplexed onto the same GIST TLS connection.
</t>

<t>

Yet, in order to allow for finer-grain per-session or per-user admission control,
it is necessary to provide a mechanism for ensuring that the use of
resources by a host has been properly authorized before allowing the
signaling application to commit the resource request, e.g., a QoS
reservation or mappings for NAT traversal.  In order to meet this
requirement, there must be information in the NSLP message which may
be used to verify the validity of the request.  This can be done by
providing the host with a session authorization policy element which
is inserted into the message and verified by the respective 
network elements.

</t>
<t>

This document describes a generic NSLP layer session authorization
policy object (AUTH_SESSION) used to convey authorization information
for the request. Generic in this context means that it is usable by
all NSLPs. The scheme is based on third-party tokens. A trusted
third party provides authentication tokens to clients and allows
verification of the information by the network elements. The requesting
host inserts its authorization information acquired from the trusted
third party into the NSLP message to allow verification of the network
resource request. Network elements verify the request and then process
the resource reservation message based on admission policy. This work is
based on RFC 3520 <xref target="RFC3520" /> and RFC 3521 <xref
target="RFC3521" />.

</t>

<t>

The default operation of the authorization is to add one authorization
policy object. Yet, in order to support end-to-end signaling and request
authorization from different networks, a host initiating an NSLP
signaling session may add more than one AUTH_SESSION object in the
message. The identifier of the authorizing entity can be used by the
network elements to use the third party they trust to verify the
request.

</t>

</section>

<section title="Session Authorization Object" anchor='sec-session-auth-object-formats'>

<t>

   This section presents a new NSLP layer object called session
   authorization (AUTH_SESSION). The AUTH_SESSION object can be used in
   the currently specified and future NSLP protocols.

</t>
<t>

   The authorization attributes follow the format and specification
   given in RFC3520 <xref target="RFC3520" />.

</t>

<section title="Session Authorization Object format">

<t>

The AUTH_SESSION object contains a list of fields which describe
the session, along with other attributes. The object header follows 
the generic NSLP object header, therefore it can be used together
with any NSLP.

The value for the Type field comes from shared NSLP object type space.
The Length field is given in units of 32 bit words and measures the
length of the Value component of the TLV object (i.e. it does not
include the standard header).

</t>
<t>

The bits marked 'A' and 'B' are extensibility flags, and used to
signal the desired treatment for objects whose treatment has not been
defined in the protocol specification (i.e. whose Type field is
unknown at the receiver). The following four categories of object
have been identified, and are described here for informational
purposes only, i.e., for normative behavior refer to the particular 
NSLP documents (e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp" /> 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw" />).

</t>
<t>

AB=00 ("Mandatory"): If the object is not understood, the entire
message containing it MUST be rejected, and an error message sent
back (usually of class/code "Protocol Error/Unknown object present").

</t>
<t>

AB=01 ("Ignore"): If the object is not understood, it MUST be deleted
and the rest of the message processed as usual.

</t>
<t>

AB=10 ("Forward"): If the object is not understood, it MUST be
retained unchanged in any message forwarded as a result of message
processing, but not stored locally.

</t>
<t>

AB=11 ("Refresh"): If the object is not understood, it should be
incorporated into the locally stored signaling application state for
this flow/session, forwarded in any resulting message, and also used
in any refresh or repair message which is generated locally. 
This flag cominbation is not used by all NSLPs, e.g., it is not
used in NATFW NSLP.

</t>
<t>

The remaining bits marked 'r' are reserved. The extensibility flags
follow the definition in the GIST specification. The AUTH_SESSION object
defines in this specification MUST have the AB-bits set to "10". An NSLP 
Node (NN) may use the authorization information if it is configured to do 
so, but may also just skip the object.

In scenarios where a destination address is required (see <xref target='sec-framework'></xref>),
at least one of the subtypes 1 or 2 MUST be included
in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element. Multiple
DEST_ADDR attributes MAY be included if multiple addresses have been

At most, one instance of subtype 3 MAY be included in every Session
Authorization Data Policy Element. At most, one instance of subtype 4
MAY be included in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element.
Inclusion of a subtype 3 attribute does not prevent inclusion of a
subtype 4 attribute (i.e., both UDP and TCP ports may be authorized).

<section title="NSLP Object List" anchor='sec-nslp-object-list'>

<t>

The NSLP_OBJECT_LIST attribute contains a list of NSLP objects
types that are used in the keyed-hash computation whose result is
given in the AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute.  This allows for an
integrity protection of NSLP PDUs. If an NSLP_OBJECT_LIST
attribute has been included in the AUTH_SESSION policy element, an
AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute MUST also be present.

</t>

<t>

The creator of the this attribute lists every NSLP object type
whose NSLP PDU object was included in the computation of the
hash. The receiver can verify the integrity of the NSLP PDU
by computing a hash over all NSLP objects that are listed
in this attribute including all the attributes 
of the authorization object. Since all NSLP object types
are unique over all different NSLPs, this will work
for any NSLP.

</t>

<t>

Basic NTLP/NSLP objects like the session ID, the NSLPID and
the MRI MUST be always included in the HMAC. Since they
are not carried within the NSLP itself, but only within GIST,
they must be delivered via the GIST API and normalized to
their network representation from <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp" /> 
again before calculating the hash. These values are hashed first, before
any other NSLP object values that are included in the hash computation.

<section title="Operational Setting using shared symmetric keys">

<t>

This assumes both the Authorizing Entity and the Network router/PDP (Policy Decision Point) 
are provisioned with shared symmetric keys and with policies detailing which
algorithm to be used for computing the authentication data along with
the expected length of the authentication data for that particular
algorithm.

</t>
<t>

Key maintenance is outside the scope of this document, but AUTH_SESSION
implementations MUST at least provide the ability to manually configure
keys and their parameters. The key used to produce the authentication
data is identified by the AUTH_ENT_ID field. Since multiple keys may be
configured for a particular AUTH_ENT_ID value, the first 32 bits of the
AUTH_DATA field MUST be a key ID to be used to identify the appropriate
key. Each key must also be configured with lifetime parameters for the
time period within which it is valid as well as an associated
cryptographic algorithm parameter specifying the algorithm to be used
with the key. At a minimum, all AUTH_SESSION implementations MUST
support the HMAC-MD5-128 <xref target="RFC1321" /> <xref
target="RFC2104" /> cryptographic algorithm for computing the
authentication data.

</t>
<t>

It is good practice to regularly change keys. Keys MUST be configurable
such that their lifetimes overlap allowing smooth transitions between
keys. At the midpoint of the lifetime overlap between two keys, senders
should transition from using the current key to the next/longer-lived
key. Meanwhile, receivers simply accept any identified key received
within its configured lifetime and reject those that are not.

</t>

</section>

<section title="Kerberos">

<t>

RFC 3520 provides a mechanism to secure the authorization token using
Kerberos. Since Kerberos is widely used for end-user authorization, 
e.g., in Windows domains, it is well suited for being used in this 
context. For instance, users may request tickets for authorization of
installing rules in an NATFW-capable router. 

</t>

<t>

A later version of this draft will detail the specific usage of
Kerberos.

<section title="Public Key">

In a public key environment, the AUTH_ENT_ID MUST be of the subtypes:

</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">

SOURCE_ADDR        the source address of the entity that created
                   the HMAC
</t>

<t>
START_TIME         the timestamp when the HMAC signature was 
                   calculated. This MUST be different for any 
		   two messages in sequence in order to prevent
		   replay attacks. Since the NTP timestamp
		   provides currently a resolution of 200 pico seconds
		   this should be sufficient.
</t>

<t>
NSLP_OBJECT_LIST   this attribute lists all NSLP objects that
                   are included into HMAC calculation.
</t>


<t>
AUTHENTICATION_DATA this attribute contains the Key-ID

		    as well as the HMAC data itself <xref target="RFC2104" />.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
The key used for HMAC calculation must be exchanged securely by some
other means, e.g., a Kerberos Ticket or pre-shared manual installation
etc.  The Key-ID in the AUTHENTICATION_DATA allows to refer to the
appropriate key and also to periodically change signing keys within a
session.  The key length MUST be 64-bit at least, but it is ideally
longer in order to defend against brute force attacks. It is
recommended to use a per-user key for signing NSLP messages.
This allows for verification of the authenticity of the message
and thus provides a basis for a session-based per-user authorization.

<section title="Framework" anchor='sec-framework'>

<t>

RFC3521 <xref target="RFC3521" /> describes a framework in which the
AUTH_SESSION policy element may be utilized to transport information
required for authorizing resource reservation for media flows.
RFC3521 introduces 4 different models:

</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">

<t> 
The coupled model
</t>
<t>
The associated model with one policy server
</t>
<t>
The associated model with two policy servers
</t>
<t>
The non-associated model.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>

The fields that are required in an AUTH SESSION policy element
dependent on which of the models is used.

</t>

<section title="The Coupled Model">

<t>
In the coupled model, the only information that MUST be included in the
policy element is the SESSION_ID; it is used by the Authorizing Entity
to correlate the resource reservation request with the media authorized
during session set up. Since the End Host is assumed to be untrusted,
the Policy Server SHOULD take measures to ensure that the integrity of
the SESSION_ID is preserved in transit; the exact mechanisms to be used
and the format of the SESSION_ID are implementation dependent.

</t>

</section>

<section title="The associated model with one policy server">

<t>

In this model, the contents of the AUTH_SESSION policy element MUST
include:

</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>

  A session identifier - SESSION_ID. This is information that the
   authorizing entity can use to correlate the resource request with 
   the media authorized during session set up.

</t>
<t>

  The identity of the authorizing entity - AUTH_ENT_ID.  This
   information is used by an NN to determine which
   authorizing entity (Policy Server) should be used to solicit
   resource policy decisions.

</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>

In some environments, an NN may have no means for determining
if the identity refers to a legitimate Policy Server within its domain.
In order to protect against redirection of authorization requests to a
bogus authorizing entity, the AUTH_SESSION MUST also include:

</t>

<t>
<list style="empty">
<t>

AUTHENTICATION_DATA. This authentication data is calculated over all
other fields of the AUTH_SESSION policy element.

</t>
</list>
</t>

</section>

<section title="The associated model with two policy servers">

<t>
The content of the AUTH_SESSION Policy Element is identical to the
associated model with one policy server.

</t>

</section>

<section title="The non-associated model">

<t>

In this model, the AUTH_SESSION MUST contain sufficient information
to allow the Policy Server to make resource policy decisions
autonomously from the authorizing entity.  The policy element is
created using information about the session by the authorizing
entity.  The information in the AUTH_SESSION policy element MUST
include:

</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">

<t>

  Initiating party IP address or Identity (e.g., FQDN) - SOURCE_ADDR
   X-TYPE

</t>
<t>

  Responding party IP address or Identity (e.g., FQDN) - DEST_ADDR
   X-TYPE

</t>
<t>

  The characteristics of (each of) the media stream(s) authorized
   for this session - RESOURCES X-TYPE

</t>
<t>

  The authorization lifetime - START_TIME X-TYPE

</t>
<t>

  The identity of the authorizing entity to allow for validation of
   the token in shared symmetric key and Kerberos schemes -
   AUTH_ENT_ID X-TYPE

</t>
<t>

  The credentials of the authorizing entity in a public-key
   scheme - AUTH_ENT_ID X-TYPE

</t>
<t>

  Authentication data used to prevent tampering with the
   AUTH_SESSION policy element - AUTHENTICATION_DATA

</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>

Furthermore, the AUTH_SESSION policy element MAY contain:

</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
  The lifetime of (each of) the media stream(s) - END_TIME X-TYPE

</t>
<t>

  Initiating party port number - SOURCE_ADDR X-TYPE

</t>
<t>

  Responding party port number - DEST_ADDR X-TYPE

</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>

All AUTH_SESSION fields MUST match with the resource request.  If a
field does not match, the request SHOULD be denied.

</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Message Processing Rules">

<t>

This section discusses the message processing related to the
AUTH_SESSION object. We describe the details of the QoS NSLP and NAT/FW
NSLP. New NSLP protocols should use the same logic in making use of the
AUTH_SESSION object.

</t>

<section title="Generation of the AUTH_SESSION by the authorizing entity">

<t>
<list style="numbers">

<t>
Generate the AUTH_SESSION policy element with the appropriate
contents as specified in <xref target='sec-session-auth-object-formats'></xref>.

</t>
<t>

If authentication is needed, the entire AUTH_SESSION policy element is
constructed, excluding the length, type and subtype fields of the
AUTH_SESSION field. Note that the message MUST include a START_TIME to
prevent replay attacks.  The output of the authentication algorithm,
plus appropriate header information, is appended as
AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute to the AUTH_SESSION policy element.

</t>

</list>

</t>

</section>



<section title="Processing within the QoS NSLP">

<t>

The AUTH_SESSION object may be used with QoS NSLP QUERY and RESERVE
messages to authorize the query operation for network resources, and a
resource reservation request, respectively.

</t>
<t>

Moreover, the AUTH_SESSION object may also be used with RESPONSE
messages in order to indicate that the authorizing entity changed the
original request. For example, the session start or end times may have
been modified, or the client may have requested authorization for all
ports, but the authorizing entity only allowed the use of certain ports.

</t>
<t>

If the QoS NSIS Initiator (QNI) receives a RESPONSE message with an
AUTH_SESSION object, the QNI MUST inspect the AUTH_SESSION object to see
what authentication attribute was changed by an authorizing entity. The
QNI SHOULD also silently accept AUTH_SESSION objects in RESPONSE message
which do not indicate any change to the original authorization request.

</t>

<section title="Message Generation">

<t>

A QoS NSLP message is created as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp" />.

If the QNE is policy aware then it SHOULD use the Diameter QoS
application or the RADIUS QoS protocol to communicate with the PDP. To
construct the AAA message it is necessary to extract the AUTH_SESSION

craft the respective RADIUS or Diameter message. The message processing
and object format is described in the respective RADIUS or Diameter QoS
protocol, respectively. If the QNE is policy unaware then it ignores
the policy data objects and continues processing the NSLP message.

</t>
<t>

If the response from the PDP is negative the request must be
rejected. A negative response in RADIUS is an Access-Reject and in
Diameter is based on the 'DIAMETER_SUCCESS' value in the Result-Code AVP
of the QoS-Authz-Answer (QAA) message. The QNE must contruct and send a
RESPONSE message with the status of authorization failure as specified
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp" />.

<section title="Integrity Protection of NSLP messages">

<t>

The AUTH_SESSION object can also be used to provide an integrity
protection for every NSLP signaling message, thereby also authorizing
requests or responses. Assume that a user has deposited a shared key
at some NN. This NN can then verify the integrity of every NSLP message
sent by the user to the NN, thereby authorizing actions like resource
reservations or opening firewall pinholes according to policy decisions
earlier made. 

</t>

<t>

The sender of an NSLP message creates an AUTH_SESSION object that
contains AUTH_ENT_ID attribute set to HMAC_SIGNED (cf. <xref
target='sec-hmac-signed'/>) and hashes with the shared key over all
NSLP objects that need to be protected and lists them in the
NSLP_OBJECT_LIST.  The AUTH_SESSION object itself is also protected by
the HMAC.  By inclusion of the AUTH_SESSION object into the NSLP
message, the receiver of this NSLP message can verify its integrity if
it has the suitable shared key for the HMAC. Any response to the
sender should also be protected by inclusion of an AUTH_SESSION object
in order to prevent attackers sending unauthorized responses on behalf 
of the real NN.

</t>

<t>

If an AUTH_SESSION object is present that has an AUTH_ENT_ID attribute
set to HMAC_SIGNED, the integrity of all NSLP elements listed in the
NSLP_OBJECT_LIST has to be checked, including the AUTH_SESSION object
contents itself. Furthermore, session ID, MRI, and NSLP ID have to
be included into the checksum, too, as specified in 
<xref target='sec-nslp-object-list'></xref>.  The key that is used to
calculate the HMAC is referred to by the Key ID included in the
AUTH_DATA attribute.  If the provided timestamp in START_TIME is not
recent enough or the calculated HMAC differs from the one provided in
AUTH_DATA the message must be discarded silently and an error should
be logged locally.

</t>

</section>


</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>

This document describes a mechanism for session authorization to prevent
theft of service. There are three types of security issues to consider:
protection against replay attacks, integrity of the AUTH_SESSION
object, and the choice of the authentication algorithms and keys.

</t>

<t>

The first issue, replay attacks, MUST be prevented. In the
non-associated model, the AUTH_SESSION object MUST include a START_TIME
field and the NNs as well as Policy Servers MUST support NTP to ensure proper clock
synchronization. Failure to ensure proper clock synchronization will
allow replay attacks since the clocks of the different network entities
may not be in synch. The start time is used to verify that the request
is not being replayed at a later time. In all other models, the
SESSION_ID is used by the Policy Server to ensure that the resource
request successfully correlates with records of an authorized session.
If a AUTH_SESSION object is replayed, it MUST be detected by the policy
server (using internal algorithms) and the request MUST be rejected.

</t>
<t>

The second issue, the integrity of the policy element, is preserved in
untrusted environments by including the AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute.
Therefore, this attribute MUST always be included.

</t>
<t>

In environments where shared symmetric keys are possible, they should be
used in order to keep the AUTH_SESSION policy element size to a strict
minimum, e.g., when wireless links are used. A secondary option would be
PKI authentication, which provides a high level of security and good
scalability. However, it requires the presence of credentials in the
AUTH_SESSION policy element which impacts its size.

</t>

<t>

Further security issues are outlined in RFC 4081 <xref target="RFC4081" />.

</t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>
This specification makes the following request to IANA:

<list style="numbers">

<t>
Assign a new object value (AUTH_SESSION_OBJECT) for the AUTH_SESSION object from the shared
NSLP object value space.
</t>

<t>

All AUTH_SESSION object internal values and numbers should be taken from
the allocations already done for RFC 3520 <xref target="RFC3520" />.
A new value must be assigned for the newly defined subtype HMAC_SIGNED
of X-Type AUTH_ENT_ID.

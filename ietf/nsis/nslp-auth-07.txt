            Authorization for NSIS Signaling Layer Protocols
                    draft-ietf-nsis-nslp-auth-07.txt

Abstract

   Signaling layer protocols specified within the NSIS framework may
   rely on the GIST (General Internet Signaling Transport) protocol to
   handle authorization.  Still, the signaling layer protocol above GIST
   itself may require separate authorization to be performed when a node
   receives a request for a certain kind of service or resources.  This
   draft presents a generic model and object formats for session
   authorization within the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocols.  The goal of
   session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between
   network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a
   service and to coordinate actions between the signaling and transport
   planes.

2.  Introduction

   The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) framework [RFC4080] defines a
   suite of protocols for the next generation in Internet signaling.
   The design is based on a generalized transport protocol for signaling
   applications, the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST)
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp], and various kinds of signaling applications.
   Two signaling applications and their NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol
   (NSLP) have been designed, a Quality of Service application (QoS
   NSLP) [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp] and a NAT/firewall application
   (NAT/FW) [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw].

   The basic security architecture for NSIS is based on a chain-of-trust
   model, where each GIST hop may choose the appropriate security
   protocol, taking into account the signaling application requirements.
   For instance, communication between two directly adjacent GIST peers
   may be secured via TCP/TLS.  On the one hand this model is
   appropriate for a number of different use cases, and allows the
   signaling applications to leave the handling of security to GIST.  On
   the other hand, several sessions of different signaling applications
   are then multiplexed onto the same GIST TLS connection.

   Yet, in order to allow for finer-grain per-session or per-user
   admission control, it is necessary to provide a mechanism for
   ensuring that the use of resources by a host has been properly
   authorized before allowing the signaling application to commit the
   resource request, e.g., a QoS reservation or mappings for NAT
   traversal.  In order to meet this requirement, there must be
   information in the NSLP message which may be used to verify the
   validity of the request.  This can be done by providing the host with
   a session authorization policy element which is inserted into the
   message and verified by the respective network elements.

   This document describes a generic NSLP layer session authorization
   policy object (SESSION_AUTH) used to convey authorization information
   for the request.  Generic in this context means that it is usable by
   all NSLPs.  The scheme is based on third-party tokens.  A trusted
   third party provides authentication tokens to clients and allows
   verification of the information by the network elements.  The
   requesting host inserts its authorization information acquired from
   the trusted third party into the NSLP message to allow verification
   of the network resource request.  Network elements verify the request
   and then process it based on admission policy (e.g., they perform a
   resource reservation or change bindings or firewall filter).  This
   work is based on RFC 3520 [RFC3520] and RFC 3521 [RFC3521].

   The default operation when using NSLP layer session authorization is
   to add one authorization policy object.  Yet, in order to support

   end-to-end signaling and request authorization from different
   networks, a host initiating an NSLP signaling session may add more
   than one SESSION_AUTH object in the message.  The identifier of the
   authorizing entity can be used by the network elements to use the
   third party they trust to verify the request.

3.  Session Authorization Object

   This section presents a new NSLP layer object called session
   authorization (SESSION_AUTH).  The SESSION_AUTH object can be used in
   the currently specified and future NSLP protocols.

   The authorization attributes follow the format and specification
   given in RFC3520 [RFC3520].

3.1.  Session Authorization Object format

   The SESSION_AUTH object contains a list of fields which describe the
   session, along with other attributes.  The object header follows the
   generic NSLP object header, therefore it can be used together with
   any NSLP.


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |A|B|r|r|         Type          |r|r|r|r|        Length         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   +                                                               +
   //         Session Authorization Attribute List                //
   +                                                               +
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+


   The value for the Type field comes from shared NSLP object type
   space.  The Length field is given in units of 32 bit words and
   measures the length of the Value component of the TLV object (i.e. it
   does not include the standard header).

   The bits marked 'A' and 'B' are extensibility flags, and used to
   signal the desired treatment for objects whose treatment has not been
   defined in the protocol specification (i.e. whose Type field is
   unknown at the receiver).  The following four categories of object
   have been identified, and are described here for informational
   purposes only, i.e., for normative behavior refer to the particular
   NSLP documents (e.g., [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp]
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw]).

   AB=00 ("Mandatory"): If the object is not understood, the entire
   message containing it MUST be rejected, and an error message sent
   back (usually of class/code "Protocol Error/Unknown object present").

   AB=01 ("Ignore"): If the object is not understood, it MUST be deleted
   and the rest of the message processed as usual.

Internet-Draft                  NSLP AUTH                 September 2010


   AB=10 ("Forward"): If the object is not understood, it MUST be
   retained unchanged in any message forwarded as a result of message
   processing, but not stored locally.

   AB=11 ("Refresh"): If the object is not understood, it should be
   incorporated into the locally stored signaling application state for
   this flow/session, forwarded in any resulting message, and also used
   in any refresh or repair message which is generated locally.  This
   flag combination is not used by all NSLPs, e.g., it is not used in
   NATFW NSLP.

   The remaining bits marked 'r' are reserved.  The extensibility flags
   follow the definition in the GIST specification.  The SESSION_AUTH
   object defines in this specification MUST have the AB-bits set to
   "10".  An NSLP Node (NN) may use the authorization information if it
   is configured to do so, but may also just skip the object.

   Type: SESSION_AUTH_OBJ (IANA-TBD)

   Length: Variable, contains length of Session authorization object
   list in units of 32 bit words.

   Session Authorization Attribute List: variable length

      The session authorization attribute list is a collection of
      objects that describes the session and provides other information
      necessary to verify resource request (e.g., a resource
      reservation, binding, or firewall filter change request).  An
      initial set of valid objects is described in Section 3.2.

3.2.  Session Authorization Attributes

   A session authorization attribute may contain a variety of
   information and has both an attribute type and subtype.  The
   attribute itself MUST be a multiple of 4 octets in length, and any
   attributes that are not a multiple of 4 octets long MUST be padded to
   a 4-octet boundary.  All padding bytes MUST have a value of zero.

    0                   1                   2                   3

      The Length field is two octets and indicates the actual length of
      the attribute (including Length, X-Type and SubType fields) in
      number of octets.  The length does NOT include any bytes padding
      to the value field to make the attribute a multiple of 4 octets
      long.

   X-Type: 8 bits

      Session authorization attribute type (X-Type) field is one octet.
      IANA acts as a registry for X-Types as described in Section 8,
      IANA Considerations.  This specification uses the following
      X-Types:

   1.  AUTH_ENT_ID The unique identifier of the entity that authorized
       the session.

   2.  SESSION_ID Unique identifier for this session, usually created
       locally at the authorizing entity.  See also RFC 3520 [RFC3520],
       not to be confused with the SESSIONID of GIST/NSIS.

   3.  SOURCE_ADDR Address specification for the signaling session
       initiator, i.e., the source address of the signaling message
       originator.

   4.  DEST_ADDR Address specification for the signaling session end-
       point.

   5.  START_TIME The starting time for the session.

   6.  END_TIME The end time for the session.

   7.  AUTHENTICATION_DATA Authentication data of the session
       authorization policy element.

   SubType: 8 bits

      Session authorization attribute sub-type is one octet in length.
      The value of the SubType depends on the X-Type.

   Value: variable length

      The attribute specific information.

3.2.1.  Authorizing Entity Identifier

   AUTH_ENT_ID is used to identify the entity that authorized the
   initial service request and generated the session authorization
   policy element.  The AUTH_ENT_ID may be represented in various

   formats, and the SubType is used to define the format for the ID.
   The format for AUTH_ENT_ID is as follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+


   Length: Length of the attribute, which MUST be > 4.

   X-Type: AUTH_ENT_ID

   SubType:

      The following sub-types for AUTH_ENT_ID are defined.  IANA acts as
      a registry for AUTH_ENT_ID sub-types as described in Section 8,
      IANA Considerations.  Initially, the registry contains the
      following sub-types of AUTH_ENT_ID:

   1.   IPV4_ADDRESS IPv4 address represented in 32 bits

   2.   IPV6_ADDRESS IPv6 address represented in 128 bits

   3.   FQDN Fully Qualified Domain Name as defined in [RFC1034] as an
        ASCII string.

   4.   ASCII_DN X.500 Distinguished name as defined in [RFC4514] as an
        ASCII string.

   5.   UNICODE_DN X.500 Distinguished name as defined in [RFC4514] as a
        UTF-8 string.

   6.   URI Universal Resource Identifier, as defined in [RFC3986].

   7.   KRB_PRINCIPAL Fully Qualified Kerberos Principal name
        represented by the ASCII string of a principal followed by the @
        realm name as defined in [RFC4120] (e.g., johndoe@nowhere).

   8.   X509_V3_CERT The Distinguished Name of the subject of the
        certificate as defined in [RFC4514] as a UTF-8 string.

   9.   PGP_CERT The OpenPGP certificate of the authorizing entity as
        defined as Public-Key Packet in [RFC4880].

   10.  HMAC_SIGNED Indicates that the AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute
        contains a self-signed HMAC signature [RFC2104] that ensures the
        integrity of the NSLP message.  The HMAC is calculated over all
        NSLP objects given in the NSLP_OBJECT_LIST attribute that MUST
        also be present.  The object specifies the Hash Algorithm that
        is used for calculation of the HMAC as Transform ID from
        Transform Type 3 of the IKEv2 registry [RFC4306].

   OctetString: Contains the authorizing entity identifier.

3.2.2.  Session Identifier

   SESSION_ID is a unique identifier used by the authorizing entity to
   identify the request.  It may be used for a number of purposes,
   including replay detection, or to correlate this request to a policy
   decision entry made by the authorizing entity.  For example, the
   SESSION_ID can be based on simple sequence numbers or on a standard
   NTP timestamp.

   X-Type: SESSION_ID

   SubType:

   No subtypes for SESSION_ID are currently defined; this field MUST be
   set to zero.  The authorizing entity is the only network entity that
   needs to interpret the contents of the SESSION_ID therefore the
   contents and format are implementation dependent.

   OctetString: The OctetString contains the session identifier.

3.2.3.  Source Address

   SOURCE_ADDR is used to identify the source address specification of
   the authorized session.  This X-Type may be useful in some scenarios
   to make sure the resource request has been authorized for that
   particular source address and/or port.  Usually, it corresponds to

   X-Type: SOURCE_ADDR

   SubType:

      The following sub types for SOURCE_ADDR are defined.  IANA acts as
      a registry for SOURCE_ADDR sub-types as described in Section 8,
      IANA Considerations.  Initially, the registry contains the
      following sub types for SOURCE_ADDR:

   1.  IPV4_ADDRESS IPv4 address represented in 32 bits

   2.  IPV6_ADDRESS IPv6 address represented in 128 bits

   3.  UDP_PORT_LIST list of UDP port specifications, represented as 16
       bits per list entry.

   4.  TCP_PORT_LIST list of TCP port specifications, represented as 16
       bits per list entry.

   5.  SPI Security Parameter Index represented in 32 bits

   OctetString: The OctetString contains the source address information.

   In scenarios where a source address is required (see Section 5), at
   least one of the subtypes 1 or 2 MUST be included in every Session
   Authorization Data Policy Element.  Multiple SOURCE_ADDR attributes
   MAY be included if multiple addresses have been authorized.  The
   source address of the request (e.g., a QoS NSLP RESERVE) MUST match
   one of the SOURCE_ADDR attributes contained in this Session
   Authorization Data Policy Element.

   At most, one instance of subtype 3 MAY be included in every Session
   Authorization Data Policy Element.  At most, one instance of subtype

   4 MAY be included in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element.
   Inclusion of a subtype 3 attribute does not prevent inclusion of a
   subtype 4 attribute (i.e., both UDP and TCP ports may be authorized).

   If no PORT attributes are specified, then all ports are considered
   valid; otherwise, only the specified ports are authorized for use.
   Every source address and port list must be included in a separate
   SOURCE_ADDR attribute.

3.2.4.  Destination Address

   DEST_ADDR is used to identify the destination address of the
   authorized session.  This X-Type may be useful in some scenarios to
   make sure the resource request has been authorized for that
   particular destination address and/or port.

   OctetString: The OctetString contains the destination address
   specification.

   In scenarios where a destination address is required (see Section 5),
   at least one of the subtypes 1 or 2 MUST be included in every Session
   Authorization Data Policy Element.  Multiple DEST_ADDR attributes MAY
   be included if multiple addresses have been authorized.  The
   destination address field of the resource reservation datagram (e.g.,
   QoS NSLP Reserve) MUST match one of the DEST_ADDR attributes
   contained in this Session Authorization Data Policy Element.

   At most, one instance of subtype 3 MAY be included in every Session
   Authorization Data Policy Element.  At most, one instance of subtype
   4 MAY be included in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element.
   Inclusion of a subtype 3 attribute does not prevent inclusion of a
   subtype 4 attribute (i.e., both UDP and TCP ports may be authorized).

   If no PORT attributes are specified, then all ports are considered
   valid; otherwise, only the specified ports are authorized for use.

   Every destination address and port list must be included in a
   separate DEST_ADDR attribute.

3.2.5.  Start time

   START_TIME is used to identify the start time of the authorized
   session and can be used to prevent replay attacks.  If the
   SESSION_AUTH policy element is presented in a resource request, the
   network SHOULD reject the request if it is not received within a few
   seconds of the start time specified.

       [RFC5905].

   OctetString: The OctetString contains the start time.

3.2.6.  End time

   END_TIME is used to identify the end time of the authorized session
   and can be used to limit the amount of time that resources are
   authorized for use (e.g., in prepaid session scenarios).

3.2.7.  NSLP Object List

   The NSLP_OBJECT_LIST attribute contains a list of NSLP objects types
   that are used in the keyed-hash computation whose result is given in
   the AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute.  This allows for an integrity
   protection of NSLP PDUs.  If an NSLP_OBJECT_LIST attribute has been

   included in the SESSION_AUTH policy element, an AUTHENTICATION_DATA
   attribute MUST also be present.

   The creator of this attribute lists every NSLP object type whose NSLP
   PDU object was included in the computation of the hash.  The hash
   computation has to follow the order of the NSLP object types as
   specified by the list.  The receiver can verify the integrity of the
   NSLP PDU by computing a hash over all NSLP objects that are listed in
   this attribute (in the given order) including all the attributes of
   the authorization object.  Since all NSLP object types are unique
   over all different NSLPs, this will work for any NSLP.

   Basic NTLP/NSLP objects like the session ID, the NSLPID and the MRI
   MUST be always included in the HMAC.  Since they are not carried
   within the NSLP itself, but only within GIST, they have to be
   provided for HMAC calculation, e.g., they can be delivered via the
   GIST API.  They MUST be normalized to their network representation
   from [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp] again before calculating the hash.  These
   values MUST be hashed first (in order sessionID, NSLPID, MRI), before
   any other NSLP object values that are included in the hash
   computation.

   A summary of the NSLP_OBJECT_LIST attribute format is described
   below.

   NSLP object type: the NSLP 12-bit object type identifier of the
   object that was included in the hash calculation.  The NSLP object
   type values comprise only 12 bit, so four bits per type value are
   currently not used within the list.  Depending on the number of
   signed objects, a corresponding padding word of 16 bit must be
   supplied.

   padding: padding MUST be added if the number of NSLP objects is even
   and MUST NOT be added if the number of NSLP objects is odd.  If
   padding has to be applied the padding field MUST be 16 bit set to 0
   and its contents MUST be ignored upon reception.

3.2.8.  Authentication data

   The AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute contains the authentication data of
   the SESSION_AUTH policy element and signs all the data in the policy
   element up to the AUTHENTICATION_DATA.  If the AUTHENTICATION_DATA
   attribute has been included in the SESSION_AUTH policy element, it
   MUST be the last attribute in the list.  The algorithm used to
   compute the authentication data depends on the AUTH_ENT_ID SubType
   field.  See Section 4 entitled Integrity of the SESSION_AUTH policy
   element.

4.  Integrity of the SESSION_AUTH policy element

   This section describes how to ensure the integrity of the policy
   element is preserved.

4.1.  Shared symmetric keys

   In shared symmetric key environments, the AUTH_ENT_ID MUST be of

4.1.1.  Operational Setting using shared symmetric keys

   This assumes both the Authorizing Entity and the Network router/PDP
   (Policy Decision Point) are provisioned with shared symmetric keys
   and with policies detailing which algorithm to be used for computing
   the authentication data along with the expected length of the
   authentication data for that particular algorithm.

   Key maintenance is outside the scope of this document, but
   SESSION_AUTH implementations MUST at least provide the ability to
   manually configure keys and their parameters.  The key used to
   produce the authentication data is identified by the AUTH_ENT_ID
   field.  Since multiple keys may be configured for a particular
   AUTH_ENT_ID value, the first 32 bits of the AUTH_DATA field MUST be a
   key ID to be used to identify the appropriate key.  Each key must
   also be configured with lifetime parameters for the time period
   within which it is valid as well as an associated cryptographic
   algorithm parameter specifying the algorithm to be used with the key.
   At a minimum, all SESSION_AUTH implementations MUST support the HMAC-



Manner, et al.           Expires March 26, 2011                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft                  NSLP AUTH                 September 2010


   SHA2-256 [RFC4868] [RFC2104] cryptographic algorithm for computing
   the authentication data.

   It is good practice to regularly change keys.  Keys MUST be
   configurable such that their lifetimes overlap allowing smooth
   transitions between keys.  At the midpoint of the lifetime overlap
   between two keys, senders should transition from using the current
   key to the next/longer-lived key.  Meanwhile, receivers simply accept
   any identified key received within its configured lifetime and reject
   those that are not.

4.2.  Kerberos

   Since Kerberos [RFC4120] is widely used for end-user authorization,
   e.g., in Windows domains, it is well suited for being used in the
   context of user-based authorization for NSIS sessions.  For instance,
   a user may request a ticket for authorization of installing rules in
   an NATFW-capable router.

   In a Kerberos environment, it is assumed that the user of the
   requesting NSLP host requests a ticket from the (the Kerberos Key
   Distribution Center - KDC) for using the NSLP Node (router) as
   resource (target service).  The NSLP requesting host (client) can
   present the ticket to the NSLP node via Kerberos by sending a
   KRB_CRED message to the NSLP node independently but prior to the NSLP
   exchange.  Thus, the principal name of the service must be known at
   the client in advance, though the exact IP address may not be known
   in advance.  How the name is assigned and made available to the
   client is implementation specific.  The extracted common session key
   can subsequently be used for using the HMAC_SIGNED variant of the
   SESSION_AUTH object.

   Another option is to encapsulate the credentials in the AUTH_DATA
   portion of the SESSION_AUTH object.  In this case the AUTH_ENT_ID
   MUST be of the subtype KRB_PRINCIPAL.  The KRB_PRINCIPAL field is
   defined as the Fully Qualified Kerberos Principal name of the
   authorizing entity.  The AUTH_DATA portion of the SESSION_AUTH object
   contains the KRB_CRED message that the receiving NSLP node has to
   extract and verify.  A second SESSION_AUTH object of type HMAC_SIGNED
   SHOULD protect the integrity of the NSLP message, including the prior
   SESSION_AUTH object.  The session key included in the first
   SESSION_AUTH object has to be used for HMAC calculation.

   An example of the Kerberos AUTH_DATA policy element is shown below in
   Figure 1.

4.3.  Public Key

   In a public key environment, the AUTH_ENT_ID MUST be of the subtypes:
   X509_V3_CERT or PGP_CERT.  The authentication data is used for
   authenticating the authorizing entity.  Two examples of the public
   key SESSION_AUTH policy element are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

4.3.1.  Operational Setting for public key based authentication

   Public key based authentication assumes the following:

   o  Authorizing entities have a pair of keys (private key and public
      key).

   o  Private key is secured with the authorizing entity.

   o  Public keys are stored in digital certificates and a trusted
      party, certificate authority (CA) issues these digital
      certificates.

   o  The verifier (PDP or router) has the ability to verify the digital
      certificate.

   Authorizing entity uses its private key to generate
   AUTHENTICATION_DATA.  Authenticators (router, PDP) use the
   authorizing entity's public key (stored in the digital certificate)
   to verify and authenticate the policy element.

4.3.1.1.  X.509 V3 digital certificates

   When the AUTH_ENT_ID is of type X509_V3_CERT, AUTHENTICATION_DATA
   MUST be generated by the authorizing entity following these steps:

   o  A Signed-data is constructed as defined in RFC5652 [RFC5652].  A
      digest is computed on the content (as specified in Section 6.1)
      with a signer-specific message-digest algorithm.  The certificates
      field contains the chain of authorizing entity's X.509 V3 digital



Manner, et al.           Expires March 26, 2011                [Page 21]

      certificates.  The certificate revocation list is defined in the
      crls field.  The digest output is digitally signed following
      Section 8 of RFC 3447 [RFC3447], using the signer's private key.

   When the AUTH_ENT_ID is of type X509_V3_CERT, verification at the
   verifying network element (PDP or router) MUST be done following
   these steps:

   o  Parse the X.509 V3 certificate to extract the distinguished name
      of the issuer of the certificate.

   o  Certification Path Validation is performed as defined in Section 6
      of RFC 5280 [RFC5280].

   o  Parse through the Certificate Revocation list to verify that the
      received certificate is not listed.

   o  Once the X.509 V3 certificate is validated, the public key of the
      authorizing entity can be extracted from the certificate.

   o  Extract the digest algorithm and the length of the digested data
      by parsing the CMS signed-data.

   o  The recipient independently computes the message digest.  This
      message digest and the signer's public key are used to verify the
      signature value.

   This verification ensures integrity, non-repudiation and data origin.

4.3.1.2.  PGP digital certificates

   When the AUTH_ENT_ID is of type PGP_CERT, AUTHENTICATION_DATA MUST be
   generated by the authorizing entity following these steps:

   AUTHENTICATION_DATA contains a Signature Packet as defined in Section
   5.2.3 of RFC 4880 [RFC4880].  In summary:

   o  Compute the hash of all data in the SESSION_AUTH policy element up
      to the AUTHENTICATION_DATA.

   o  The hash output is digitally signed following Section 8 of RFC
      3447, using the signer's private key.

   When the AUTH_ENT_ID is of type PGP_CERT, verification MUST be done
   by the verifying network element (PDP or router) following these
   steps:

   o  Validate the certificate.

   o  Once the PGP certificate is validated, the public key of the
      authorizing entity can be extracted from the certificate.

   o  Extract the hash algorithm and the length of the hashed data by
      parsing the PGP signature packet.

   o  The recipient independently computes the message digest.  This
      message digest and the signer's public key are used to verify the
      signature value.

   This verification ensures integrity, non-repudiation and data origin.

4.4.  HMAC Signed

   A SESSION_AUTH object that carries an AUTH_ENT_ID of HMAC_SIGNED is
   used as integrity protection for NSLP messages.  The SESSION_AUTH
   object MUST contain the following attributes:

   o  SOURCE_ADDR the source address of the entity that created the HMAC

   o  START_TIME the timestamp when the HMAC signature was calculated.
      This MUST be different for any two messages in sequence in order
      to prevent replay attacks.  Since the NTP timestamp provides
      currently a resolution of 200 pico seconds this should be
      sufficient.

   o  NSLP_OBJECT_LIST this attribute lists all NSLP objects that are
      included into HMAC calculation.

   o  AUTHENTICATION_DATA this attribute contains the Key-ID that is
      used for HMAC calculation as well as the HMAC data itself
      [RFC2104].

   The key used for HMAC calculation must be exchanged securely by some
   other means, e.g., a Kerberos Ticket or pre-shared manual
   installation etc.  The Key-ID in the AUTHENTICATION_DATA allows the
   reference to the appropriate key and also to periodically change
   signing keys within a session.  The key length MUST be 64-bit at
   least, but it is ideally longer in order to defend against brute
   force attacks during the key validity period.  For scalability
   reasons it is suggested to use a per-user key for signing NSLP
   messages, but using a per-session key is possible, too, at the cost
   of a per-session key exchange.  A per-user key allows for
   verification of the authenticity of the message and thus provides a
   basis for a session-based per-user authorization.  It is RECOMMENDED
   to periodically change the shared key in order to prevent

   eavesdroppers from performing a brute force off-line attacks on the
   shared key.  The actual hash algorithm used in the HMAC computation
   is specified by the "Transform ID" field (given as Transform Type 3
   of the IKEv2 registry [RFC4306]).  The hash algorithm MUST be chosen
   consistently between the object creator and the NN verifying the
   HMAC; this can be accomplished by out-of-band mechanisms when the
   shared key is exchanged.

   Figure 4 shows an example of an object that is used for integrity
   protection of NSLP messages.

5.  Framework

   RFC3521 [RFC3521] describes a framework in which the SESSION_AUTH
   policy element may be utilized to transport information required for
   authorizing resource reservation for data flows (e.g., media flows).
   RFC3521 introduces 4 different models:

   1.  The coupled model

   2.  The associated model with one policy server

   3.  The associated model with two policy servers

   4.  The non-associated model.

   The fields that are required in a SESSION_AUTH policy element depend
   on which of the models is used.

5.1.  The Coupled Model

   In the coupled model, the only information that MUST be included in
   the policy element is the SESSION_ID; it is used by the Authorizing
   Entity to correlate the resource reservation request with the media
   authorized during session set up.  Since the End Host is assumed to
   be untrusted, the Policy Server SHOULD take measures to ensure that
   the integrity of the SESSION_ID is preserved in transit; the exact
   mechanisms to be used and the format of the SESSION_ID are
   implementation dependent.

5.2.  The associated model with one policy server

   In this model, the contents of the SESSION_AUTH policy element MUST
   include:

   o  A session identifier - SESSION_ID.  This is information that the
      authorizing entity can use to correlate the resource request with
      the data flows authorized during session set up.

   o  The identity of the authorizing entity - AUTH_ENT_ID.  This
      information is used by an NN to determine which authorizing entity
      (Policy Server) should be used to solicit resource policy
      decisions.

   In some environments, an NN may have no means for determining if the
   identity refers to a legitimate Policy Server within its domain.  In
   order to protect against redirection of authorization requests to a
   bogus authorizing entity, the SESSION_AUTH MUST also include:

Internet-Draft                  NSLP AUTH                 September 2010


      AUTHENTICATION_DATA.  This authentication data is calculated over
      all other fields of the SESSION_AUTH policy element.

5.3.  The associated model with two policy servers

   The content of the SESSION_AUTH Policy Element is identical to the
   associated model with one policy server.

5.4.  The non-associated model

   In this model, the SESSION_AUTH MUST contain sufficient information
   to allow the Policy Server to make resource policy decisions
   autonomously from the authorizing entity.  The policy element is
   created using information about the session by the authorizing
   entity.  The information in the SESSION_AUTH policy element MUST
   include:

   o  Initiating party IP address or Identity (e.g., FQDN) - SOURCE_ADDR
      X-TYPE

   o  Responding party IP address or Identity (e.g., FQDN) - DEST_ADDR
      X-TYPE

   o  The authorization lifetime - START_TIME X-TYPE

   o  The identity of the authorizing entity to allow for validation of
      the token in shared symmetric key and Kerberos schemes -
      AUTH_ENT_ID X-TYPE

   o  The credentials of the authorizing entity in a public-key scheme -
      AUTH_ENT_ID X-TYPE

   o  Authentication data used to prevent tampering with the
      SESSION_AUTH policy element - AUTHENTICATION_DATA

   Furthermore, the SESSION_AUTH policy element MAY contain:

   o  The lifetime of (each of) the media stream(s) - END_TIME X-TYPE

   o  Initiating party port number - SOURCE_ADDR X-TYPE

   o  Responding party port number - DEST_ADDR X-TYPE

   All SESSION_AUTH fields MUST match with the resource request.  If a
   field does not match, the request SHOULD be denied.

6.  Message Processing Rules

   This section discusses the message processing related to the
   SESSION_AUTH object.  Details of the processing the SESSION_AUTH
   object within QoS NSLP and NAT/FW NSLP are described.  New NSLP
   protocols should use the same logic in making use of the SESSION_AUTH
   object.

6.1.  Generation of the SESSION_AUTH by the authorizing entity

   1.  Generate the SESSION_AUTH policy element with the appropriate
       contents as specified in Section 3.

   2.  If authentication is needed, the entire SESSION_AUTH policy
       element is constructed, excluding the length, type and subtype
       fields of the SESSION_AUTH field.  Note that the message MUST
       include a START_TIME to prevent replay attacks.  The output of
       the authentication algorithm, plus appropriate header
       information, is appended as AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute to the
       SESSION_AUTH policy element.

6.2.  Processing within the QoS NSLP

   The SESSION_AUTH object may be used with QoS NSLP QUERY and RESERVE
   messages to authorize the query operation for network resources, and
   a resource reservation request, respectively.

   Moreover, the SESSION_AUTH object may also be used with RESPONSE
   messages in order to indicate that the authorizing entity changed the
   original request.  For example, the session start or end times may
   have been modified, or the client may have requested authorization
   for all ports, but the authorizing entity only allowed the use of
   certain ports.

   If the QoS NSIS Initiator (QNI) receives a RESPONSE message with a
   SESSION_AUTH object, the QNI MUST inspect the SESSION_AUTH object to
   see what authentication attribute was changed by an authorizing
   entity.  The QNI SHOULD also silently accept SESSION_AUTH objects in
   RESPONSE message, which do not indicate any change to the original
   authorization request.

6.2.1.  Message Generation

   A QoS NSLP message is created as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].






Manner, et al.           Expires March 26, 2011                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft                  NSLP AUTH                 September 2010


   1.  The policy element received from the authorizing entity MUST be
       copied without modification into the SESSION_AUTH object.

   2.  The SESSION_AUTH object (containing the policy element) is
       inserted in the NSLP message in the appropriate place.

6.2.2.  Message Reception

   The QoS NSLP message is processed as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp] with following modifications.

   1.  If the QNE is policy aware then it SHOULD use the Diameter QoS
       application or the RADIUS QoS protocol to communicate with the
       PDP.  To construct the AAA message it is necessary to extract the
       SESSION_AUTH object and the QoS related objects from the QoS NSLP
       message and to craft the respective RADIUS or Diameter message.
       The message processing and object format is described in the
       respective RADIUS or Diameter QoS protocol, respectively.  If the
       QNE is policy unaware then it ignores the policy data objects and
       continues processing the NSLP message.

   2.  If the response from the PDP is negative the request must be
       rejected.  A negative response in RADIUS is an Access-Reject and
       in Diameter is based on the 'DIAMETER_SUCCESS' value in the
       Result-Code AVP of the QoS-Authz-Answer (QAA) message.  The QNE
       must construct and send a RESPONSE message with the status of
       authorization failure as specified in [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].

   3.  Continue processing the NSIS message.

6.2.3.  Authorization (QNE or PDP)

   1.  Retrieve the policy element from the SESSION_AUTH object.  Check
       the AUTH_ENT_ID type and SubType fields and return an error if
       the identity type is not supported.

   2.  Verify the message integrity.

       *  Shared symmetric key authentication: The QNE or PDP uses the
          AUTH_ENT_ID field to consult a table keyed by that field.  The
          table should identify the cryptographic authentication
          algorithm to be used along with the expected length of the
          authentication data and the shared symmetric key for the
          authorizing entity.  Verify that the indicated length of the
          authentication data is consistent with the configured table
          entry and validate the authentication data.

Internet-Draft                  NSLP AUTH                 September 2010


       *  Public Key: Validate the certificate chain against the trusted
          Certificate Authority (CA) and validate the message signature
          using the public key.

       *  HMAC signed: The QNE or PDP uses the Key-ID field of the
          AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute to consult a table keyed by that
          field.  The table should identify the cryptographic
          authentication algorithm to be used along with the expected
          length of the authentication data and the shared symmetric key
          for the authorizing entity.  Verify that the indicated length
          of the authentication data is consistent with the configured
          table entry and validate the integrity of parts of the NSLP
          message, i.e., session ID, MRI, NSLP ID and all other NSLP
          elements listed in the NSLP_OBJECT_LIST authentication data as
          well as the SESSION_AUTH object contents (cf. Section 6.4).

       *  Kerberos: If AUTH_DATA contains an encapsulated KRB_CRED
          message (cf. Section 4.2), the integrity of the KRB_CRED
          message can be verified within Kerberos itself.  Moreover, an
          additionally present SESSION_AUTH object using HMAC_SIGNED can
          be used to verify the message integrity as described above.

   3.  Once the identity of the authorizing entity and the validity of
       the service request has been established, the authorizing router/
       PDP MUST then consult its authorization policy in order to
       determine whether or not the specific request is authorized
       (e.g., based on available credits, information in the
       subscriber's database).  To the extent to which these access
       control decisions require supplementary information, routers/PDPs
       MUST ensure that supplementary information is obtained securely.

   4.  Verify the requested resources do not exceed the authorized QoS.

6.2.4.  Error Signaling

   When the PDP (e.g., a RADIUS or Diameter server) fails to verify the
   policy element then the appropriate actions described the respective
   AAA document need to be taken.

   The QNE node MUST return a RESPONSE message with the INFO_SPEC error
   code Authorization Failure as defined in the QoS NSLP specification.
   The QNE MAY include an INFO_SPEC Object Value Info to indicate which
   SESSION_AUTH attribute created the error.

6.3.  Processing with the NAT/FW NSLP

Internet-Draft                  NSLP AUTH                 September 2010


6.3.1.  Message Generation

   A NAT/FW NSLP message is created as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw].

   1.  The policy element received from the authorizing entity MUST be
       copied without modification into the SESSION_AUTH object.

   2.  The SESSION_AUTH object (containing the policy element) is
       inserted in the NATFW NSLP message in the appropriate place.

6.3.2.  Message Reception

   The NAT/FW NSLP message is processed as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw] with following modifications.

   1.  If the router is policy aware then it SHOULD use the Diameter
       application or the RADIUS protocol to communicate with the PDP.
       To construct the AAA message it is necessary to extract the
       SESSION_AUTH element and the NATFW policy rule related objects
       from the NSLP message and to craft the respective RADIUS or
       Diameter message.  The message processing and object format is
       described in the respective RADIUS or Diameter protocols,
       respectively.  If the router is policy unaware then it ignores
       the policy data objects and continues processing the NSLP
       message.

   2.  Reject the message if the response from the PDP is negative.  A
       negative response in RADIUS is an Access-Reject and in Diameter
       is based on the 'DIAMETER_SUCCESS' value in the Result-Code AVP.

   3.  Continue processing the NSIS message.

6.3.3.  Authorization (Router/PDP)

   1.  Retrieve the SESSION_AUTH object and the policy element.  Check
       the PE type field and return an error if the identity type is not
       supported.

   2.  Verify the message integrity.

       *  Shared symmetric key authentication: The Network router/PDP
          uses the AUTH_ENT_ID field to consult a table keyed by that
          field.  The table should identify the cryptographic
          authentication algorithm to be used along with the expected
          length of the authentication data and the shared symmetric key
          for the authorizing entity.  Verify that the indicated length
          of the authentication data is consistent with the configured

          table entry and validate the authentication data.

       *  Public Key: Validate the certificate chain against the trusted
          Certificate Authority (CA) and validate the message signature
          using the public key.

       *  HMAC signed: The QNE or PDP uses the Key-ID field of the
          AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute to consult a table keyed by that
          field.  The table should identify the cryptographic
          authentication algorithm to be used along with the expected
          length of the authentication data and the shared symmetric key
          for the authorizing entity.  Verify that the indicated length
          of the authentication data is consistent with the configured
          table entry and validate the integrity of parts of the NSLP
          message, i.e., session ID, MRI, NSLP ID and all other NSLP
          elements listed in the NSLP_OBJECT_LIST authentication data as
          well as the SESSION_AUTH object contents (cf. Section 6.4).

       *  Kerberos: If AUTH_DATA contains an encapsulated KRB_CRED
          message (cf. Section 4.2), the integrity of the KRB_CRED
          message can be verified within Kerberos itself.  Moreover, an
          additionally present SESSION_AUTH object using HMAC_SIGNED can
          be used to verify the message integrity as described above.

   3.  Once the identity of the authorizing entity and the validity of
       the service request has been established, the authorizing router/
       PDP MUST then consult its authorization policy in order to deter
       mine whether or not the specific request is authorized.  To the
       extent to which these access control decisions require
       supplementary information, routers/PDPs MUST ensure that
       supplementary information is obtained securely.

6.3.4.  Error Signaling

   When the PDP (e.g., a RADIUS or Diameter server) fails to verify the
   SESSION_AUTH element then the appropriate actions described the
   respective AAA document need to be taken.  The NATFW NSLP node MUST
   return an error message of class 'Permanent failure' (0x5) with error
   code 'Authorization failed' (0x02).

6.4.  Integrity Protection of NSLP messages

   The SESSION_AUTH object can also be used to provide an integrity
   protection for every NSLP signaling message, thereby also
   authenticating requests or responses.  Assume that a user has
   deposited a shared key at some NN.  This NN can then verify the
   integrity of every NSLP message sent by the user to the NN.  Based on
   this authentication the NN can apply authorization policies to

   actions like resource reservations or opening of firewall pinholes.

   The sender of an NSLP message creates a SESSION_AUTH object that
   contains AUTH_ENT_ID attribute set to HMAC_SIGNED (cf. Section 4.4)
   and hashes with the shared key over all NSLP objects that need to be
   protected and lists them in the NSLP_OBJECT_LIST.  The SESSION_AUTH
   object itself is also protected by the HMAC.  By inclusion of the
   SESSION_AUTH object into the NSLP message, the receiver of this NSLP
   message can verify its integrity if it has the suitable shared key
   for the HMAC.  Any response to the sender should also be protected by
   inclusion of a SESSION_AUTH object in order to prevent attackers
   sending unauthorized responses on behalf of the real NN.

   If a SESSION_AUTH object is present that has an AUTH_ENT_ID attribute
   set to HMAC_SIGNED, the integrity of all NSLP elements listed in the
   NSLP_OBJECT_LIST has to be checked, including the SESSION_AUTH object
   contents itself.  Furthermore, session ID, MRI, and NSLP ID have to
   be included into the HMAC calculation, too, as specified in
   Section 3.2.7.  The key that is used to calculate the HMAC is
   referred to by the Key ID included in the AUTH_DATA attribute.  If
   the provided timestamp in START_TIME is not recent enough or the
   calculated HMAC differs from the one provided in AUTH_DATA the
   message must be discarded silently and an error should be logged
   locally.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a mechanism for session authorization to
   prevent theft of service.  There are three types of security issues
   to consider: protection against replay attacks, integrity of the
   SESSION_AUTH object, and the choice of the authentication algorithms
   and keys.

   The first issue, replay attacks, MUST be prevented.  In the non-
   associated model, the SESSION_AUTH object MUST include a START_TIME
   field and the NNs as well as Policy Servers MUST support NTP to
   ensure proper clock synchronization.  Failure to ensure proper clock
   synchronization will allow replay attacks since the clocks of the
   different network entities may not be in sync.  The start time is
   used to verify that the request is not being replayed at a later
   time.  In all other models, the SESSION_ID is used by the Policy
   Server to ensure that the resource request successfully correlates
   with records of an authorized session.  If a SESSION_AUTH object is
   replayed, it MUST be detected by the policy server (using internal
   algorithms) and the request MUST be rejected.

   The second issue, the integrity of the policy element, is preserved
   in untrusted environments by including the AUTHENTICATION_DATA
   attribute in such environments.

   In environments where shared symmetric keys are possible, they should
   be used in order to keep the SESSION_AUTH policy element size to a
   strict minimum, e.g., when wireless links are used.  A secondary
   option would be PKI authentication, which provides a high level of
   security and good scalability.  However, it requires the presence of
   credentials in the SESSION_AUTH policy element which impacts its
   size.

   The SESSION_AUTH object can also serve to protect the integrity of
   NSLP message parts by using the HMAC_SIGNED Authentication Data as
   described in Section 6.4.

   When shared keys are used, e.g., in AUTHENTICATION_DATA Section 4.1
   or in conjunction with HMAC_SIGNED Section 4.4, it is important that
   the keys are kept secret, i.e., they must be exchanged, stored, and
   managed in a secure and confidential manner.  If the key material is
   disclosed authentication and integrity protection are useless.

   Furthermore, security considerations for public key mechanisms using
   the X.509 certificate mechanisms described in [RFC5280] apply.
   Similarly, security considerations for PGP described in [RFC4880]
   apply.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The SESSION_AUTH_OBJECT NSLP Message Object type is specified as:
   (IANA-TBD)

   [TO BE REMOVED: This specification makes the following request to
   IANA: Assign a new object value (SESSION_AUTH_OBJECT) for the
   SESSION_AUTH object from the shared NSLP Message Objects sub-
   registry: http://www.iana.org/assignments/nslp-parameters/
   nslp-parameters.xhtml]

   This document specifies an 8-bit Session authorization attribute type
   (X-Type) field as well as 8-bit SubType fields per X-Type, for which
   IANA is to create and maintain corresponding sub-registries for the
   NSLP Session Authorization Object.

   Initial values for the X-Type registry are given below and the
   Registration Procedures according to [RFC5226] are specified as
   follows:

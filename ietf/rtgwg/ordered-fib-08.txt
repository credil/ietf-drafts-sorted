             Framework for Loop-free convergence using oFIB
                    draft-ietf-rtgwg-ordered-fib-08

Abstract

   This document describes the framework of a mechanism for use in
   conjunction with link state routing protocols which prevents the
   transient loops which would otherwise occur during topology changes.
   It does this by correctly sequencing the forwarding information base
   (FIB) updates on the routers.

   This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent link or node
   shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes.  It can also be used
   in conjunction with a fast re-route mechanism which converts a sudden
   link or node failure into a non-urgent topology change.  This is
   possible where a complete repair path is provided for all affected
   destinations.

   After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that
   defines the time at which it can safely update its FIB.  A method for
   accelerating this loop-free convergence process by the use of
   completion messages is also described.

   The technology described in this document has been subject to
   extensive simulation using real network topologies and costs, and
   pathological convergence behaviour.  However mechanism described in
   this document are purely illustrative of the general approach and do
   not constitute a protocol specification.  The document represents a
   snapshot of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of
   publication and is published as a document of record.  Further work
   is needed before implementation or deployment.

Internet-Draft      Loop-free convergence using oFIB        January 2013


1.  The Purpose of this Document

   This document describes the framework of a mechanism for use in
   conjunction with link state routing protocols which prevents the
   transient loops which would otherwise occur during topology changes.
   It does this by correctly sequencing the forwarding information base
   (FIB) updates on the routers.

   At the time of publication there is no demand to deploy this
   technology, however in view of the subtleties involved in the design
   of loop-free convergence routing protocol extensions the Routing Area
   Working Group considered it desirable to publish this document to
   place on record the design consideration of the ordered FIB
   (oFIB)approach.

   The mechanisms presented in this document are purely illustrative of
   the general approach and do not constitute a protocol specification.
   The document represents a snapshot of the work of the working group
   at the time of publication and is published as a document of record.
   Additional work is needed to specify the necessary routing protocol
   extensions necessary to support this IPFRR method before
   implementation or deployment.


2.  Introduction

   With link-state protocols, such as IS-IS [ISO10589] and OSPF
   [RFC2328], each time the network topology changes, some routers need
   to modify their forwarding information base (FIB) to take into
   account the new topology.  Each topology change causes a convergence
   phase.  During this phase, routers may transiently have inconsistent
   FIBs, which may lead to packet loops and losses, even if the
   reachability of the destinations is not compromised after the
   topology change.  Packet losses and transient loops can also occur in
   the case of a link down event implied by a maintenance operation,
   even if this operation is predictable and not urgent.  When the link
   state change is a metric update and when a new link is brought up in
   the network, there is no direct loss of connectivity, but transient
   packet loops and loss can still occur.

   For example, in Figure 1, if the link between X and Y is shut down by
   an operator, packets destined to X can loop between R and Y when Y
   has updated its FIB while R has not yet updated its FIB, and packets
   destined to Y can loop between X and S if X updates its FIB before S.
   According to the current behaviour of ISIS and OSPF, this scenario
   will happen most of the time because X and Y are the first routers to
   be aware of the failure, so that they will update their FIBs first.

   It should be noted that the loops can occur remotely from the
   failure, not just adjacent to it.

   [RFC5715] provides an introduction to a number of loop-free
   convergence methods and readers unfamiliar with this technology are
   recommended to read before studying this document in detail.

   The goal of this document is to describe a mechanism which sequences
   the router FIB updates to maintain consistency throughout the
   network.  By correctly setting the FIB change order no looping or
   packet loss can occur.  This mechanism may be applied to the case of
   managed link-state changes, i.e. link metric change, manual link
   down/up, manual router down/up, and managed state changes of a set of
   links attached to one router.  It may also be applied to the case
   where one or more network elements are protected by a fast re-route
   mechanism (FRR) [RFC5714] [RFC4090].  The mechanisms that are used in
   the failure case are exactly the same as those used for managed
   changes.  For simplicity this document makes no further distinction
   between managed and unplanned changes.

   It is assumed in the description that follows that all routers in the
   routing domain are oFIB capable.  This can be verified in an
   operation network by the routers reporting oFIB capability using the
   IGP in use.  Where non-oFIB capable routers exist in the network,
   normal convergence would be used.  The operation of mixed-mode
   networks is for further study.

   The technology described in this document has been subject to
   extensive simulation using real network topologies and costs and
   pathological convergence behaviour.  A variant of the technology
   described here has been experimentally deployed in a production
   network.

3.  The required FIB update order

   This section provides an overview of the required ordering of the FIB
   updates.  A more detailed analysis of the rerouting dynamics and
   correctness proofs of the mechanism can be found in [refs.PFOB07].

3.1.  Single Link Events

   For simplicity the correct ordering for single link changes are
   described first.  The document then builds on this to demonstrate
   that the same principles can be applied to more complex scenarios
   such as line card or node changes.

3.1.1.  Link Down / Metric Increase

   First consider the non-urgent failure of a link or the increase of a
   link metric.  In this case, a router R must not update its FIB until
   all other routers that send traffic via R and the affected link have
   first updated their FIBs.

   The following argument shows that this rule ensures the correct order
   of FIB change when the link X->Y is shut down or its metric is
   increased.

   An "outdated" FIB entry for a destination is defined as being a FIB
   entry that still reflects the shortest path(s) in use before the
   topology change.  Once a packet reaches a router R that has an
   outdated FIB entry for the packet destination, then, provided the
   oFIB ordering is respected, the packet will continue to X only
   traversing routers that also have an outdated FIB entry for the
   destination.  The packet thus reaches X without looping and will be
   forwarded to Y via X->Y (or in the case of FRR, the X->Y repair path)
   and hence reach its destination.

   Since it can be assumed that the original topology was loop-free, Y
   will never use the link Y->X to reach the destination and hence the
   path(s) between Y and the destination are guaranteed to be unaffected
   by the topology change.  It therefore follows that the packet
   arriving at Y will reach its destination without looping.

   Since it can also be assumed that the new topology is loop-free, by
   definition a packet cannot loop while being forwarded exclusively by
   routers with an updated FIB entry.

   In other words, when the oFIB ordering is respected, if a packet
   reaches an outdated router, it can never subsequently reach an
   updated router, and cannot loop because from this point on it will
   only be forwarded on the consistent path that was used before the

   event.  If it does not reach an outdated router, it will only be
   forwarded on the loop free path that will be used after the
   convergence.

   According to the proposed ordering, X will be the last router to
   update its FIB.  Once it has updated its FIB, the link X->Y can
   actually be shut down (or the repair removed).

   If the link X-Y is bidirectional a similar process must be run to
   order the FIB update for destinations using the link in the direction
   Y->X. As has already been shown, no packet ever traverses the X-Y
   link in both directions, and hence the operation of the two ordering
   processes is orthogonal.

3.1.2.  Link Up / Metric Decrease

   In the case of link up events or metric decreases, a router R must
   update its FIB BEFORE all other routers that WILL use R to reach the
   affected link.

   The following argument shows that this rule ensures the correct order
   of FIB change when the link X->Y is brought into service or its
   metric is decreased.

   Firstly, when a packet reaches a router R that has already updated
   its FIB, all the routers on the path from R to X will also have
   updated their FIB, so that the packet will reach X and be forwarded
   along X->Y, ultimately reaching its destination.

   Secondly, a packet cannot loop between routers that have not yet
   updated their FIB.  This proves that no packet can loop.

3.2.  Multi-link events

   The following sections describe the required ordering for single
   events which may be manifest as multiple link events.  For example,
   the failure of a router may be notified to the rest of the network as
   the individual failure of all its attached links.  The means of
   identifying the event type from the collection of received link
   events is described in Section 4.1.

3.2.1.  Router Down events

   In the case of the non-urgent shut-down of a router, a router R must
   not update its FIB until all other routers that send traffic via R
   and the affected router have first updated their FIBs.

   Using a proof similar to that for link failure, it can be shown that



Shand, et al.             Expires July 8, 2013                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Loop-free convergence using oFIB        January 2013


   no loops will occur if this ordering is respected [refs.PFOB07].

3.2.2.  Router Up events

   In the case of a router being brought into service, a router R must
   update its FIB BEFORE all other routers that WILL use R to reach the
   affected router.

   A proof similar to that for link up, shows that no loops will occur
   if this ordering is respected [refs.PFOB07].

3.2.3.  Linecard Failure/Restoration Events

   The failure of a line card involves the failure of a set of links all
   of which have a single node in common, i.e. the parent router.  The
   ordering to be applied is the same as if it were the failure of the
   parent router.

   In a similar way, the restoration of an entire linecard to service as
   a single event can be treated as if the parent router were returning
   to service.


4.  Applying ordered FIB updates

4.1.  Deducing the topology change

   As has been described, a single event such as the failure or
   restoration of a single link, single router or a linecard may be
   notified to the rest of the network as a set of individual link
   change events.  It is necessary to deduce from this collection of
   link state notifications the type of event that has occurred in the
   network and hence the required ordering.

   When a link change event is received which impacts the receiving
   router's FIB, the routers at the near and far end of the link are
   noted.

   If all events received within some hold-down period have a single
   router (R) in common, then it is assumed that the change reflects an
   event (line-card or router change) concerning the common router (R).

   In the case of a link change event, the router at the far end of the
   link is deemed to be the common router (R).

   All ordering computations are based on treating the common router R
   as the root for both link and node events.

Internet-Draft      Loop-free convergence using oFIB        January 2013


4.2.  Deciding if ordered FIB updates applies

   There are some events (for example a subsequent failure with
   conflicting repair requirements occurring before the ordered FIB
   process has completed) that cannot be correctly processed by this
   mechanism.  In these cases it is necessary to ensure that convergence
   falls back to the conventional mode of operation (see Section 7).

   In all cases it is necessary to wait some hold-down period after
   receiving the first notification to ensure that all routers have
   received the complete set of link state notifications associated with
   the single event.

   At any time, if a link change notification is received which would
   have no effect on the receiving router's FIB, then it may be ignored.

   If no other event is received during the hold-down time, the event is
   treated as a link event.  Note that the reverse connectivity check
   means that only the first failure event, or second up event have an
   effect on the FIB.

   If an event is received within the hold down period which does NOT
   reference the common router (R) then in this version of the
   specification normal convergence is invoked immediately (see
   Section 7).

   Network reconvergence under ordered FIB takes longer than the normal
   reconvergence process.  Where the failure is protected by an FRR
   mechanism, this additional delay in convergence causes no packet
   loss.  When the sudden failure of a link or a set of links that are
   not protected using a FRR mechanism occurs this must be processed
   using the conventional (faster) mode of operation to minimise packet
   loss during re-convergence.

   In summary an ordered FIB process is applicable if the set of link
   state notifications received between the first event and the hold
   down period reference a common router R, and one of the following
   assertions is verified :
   o  The set of notifications refer to link down events concerning
      protected links and metric increase events
   o  The set of notifications refer to link up events and metric
      decrease events.


5.  Computation of the ordering

   This section describes how the required ordering is computed.

Internet-Draft      Loop-free convergence using oFIB        January 2013


5.1.  Link or Router Down or Metric Increase

   To respect the proposed ordering, routers compute a rank that will be
   used to determine the time at which they are permitted to perform
   their FIB update.  In the case of a failure event rooted at router Y
   or an increase of the metric of link X->Y, router R computes the
   reverse Shortest Path Tree (rSPT) in the topology before the failure
   (rSPT_OLD) rooted at Y. This rSPT gives the shortest paths to reach Y
   before the failure.  The branch of the reverse SPT that is below R
   corresponds to the set of shortest paths to R that are used by the
   routers that reach Y via R.

   The rank of router R is defined as the depth (in number of hops) of
   this branch.  In the case of ECMP, the maximum depth of the ECMP path
   set is used.

   Router R is required to update its FIB at time

   T0 + H + rank * MAX_FIB

   where T0 is the arrival time of the link-state packet containing the
   topology change, H is the hold-down time and MAX_FIB is a network-
   wide constant that reflects the maximum time required to update a FIB
   irrespective of the change required.  The value of MAX_FIB is network
   specific and its determination is out of the scope of this document.
   This value must be agreed by all the routers in the network.  This
   agreement can be performed by using a capability TLV as defined in
   Appendix B.

   All the routers that use R to reach Y will compute a lower rank than
   R, and hence the correct order will be respected.  It should be noted
   that only the routers that used Y before the event need to compute
   their rank.

5.2.  Link or Router Up or Metric Decrease

   In the case of a link or router up event rooted at Y or a link metric
   decrease affecting link Y->W, a router R must have a rank that is
   higher than the rank of the routers that it will use to reach Y,
   according to the rule described in Section 3.  The rank of R is thus
   the number of hops between R and Y in its renewed Shortest Path Tree.
   When R has multiple equal cost paths to Y, the rank is the length in
   hops of the longest ECMP path to Y.

   Router R is required to update its FIB at time

   T0 + H + rank * MAX_FIB

   It should be noted that only the routers that use Y after the event
   have to compute a rank, i.e. only the routers that have Y in their
   SPT after the link-state change.


6.  Acceleration of Ordered Convergence

   The mechanism described above is conservative, and hence may be
   relatively slow.  The purpose of this section is to describe a method
   of accelerating the controlled convergence in such a way that ordered
   loop-free convergence is still guaranteed.

   In many cases a router will complete its required FIB changes in a
   time much shorter than MAX_FIB and in many other cases, a router will
   not have to perform any FIB change at all.

   This section describes the use of completion messages to speed up the
   convergence by providing a means for a router to inform those routers
   waiting for it, that it has completed any required FIB changes.  When
   a router has been advised of completion by all the routers for which
   it is waiting, it can safely update its own FIB without further
   delay.  In most cases this can result in a sub-second re-convergence
   time comparable with that of normal convergence.

   Routers maintain a waiting list of the neighbours from which a
   completion message must be received.  Upon reception of a completion
   message from a neighbour, a router removes this neighbour from its
   waiting list.  Once its waiting list becomes empty, the router is
   allowed to update its FIB immediately even if its ranking timer has
   not yet expired.  Once this is done, the router sends a completion
   message to the neighbours that are waiting for it to complete.  Those
   routers are listed in a list called the Notification List.
   Completion messages contain an identification of the event to which
   they refer.

   Note that, since this is only an optimization, any loss of completion
   messages will result in the routers waiting their defined ranking
   time and hence the loop-free properties will be preserved.

6.1.  Construction of the waiting list and notification list

6.1.1.  Down events

   Consider a link or node down event rooted at router Y or the cost
   increase of the link X->Y. A router R will compute rSPT_OLD(Y) to
   determine its rank.  When doing this, R also computes the set of
   neighbors that R uses to reach the failing node or link, and the set
   of neighbors that are using R to reach the failing node or link.  The

Internet-Draft      Loop-free convergence using oFIB        January 2013


   Notification list of R is equal to the former set and the Waiting
   list of R is equal to the latter.

   Note that R could include all its neighbors except those in the
   Waiting list in the Notification list, this has no impact on the
   correctness of the protocol, but would be unnecessarily inefficient.

6.1.2.  Up Events

   Consider a link or node up event rooted at router Y or the cost
   decrease of the link Y->X. A router R will compute its new SPT
   (SPT_new(R)).  The Waiting list is the set of next hop routers that R
   uses to reach Y in SPT_new(R).

   In a simple implementation the notification list of R is all the
   neighbours of R excluding those in the Waiting list.  This may be
   further optimized by computing rSPT_new(Y) to determine those routers
   that are waiting for R to complete.

6.2.  Format of Completion Messages

   The format of completion messages and means of their delivery is
   routing protocol dependent and is outside the scope of this document.

   The following information is required:

   o  Identity of the sender.
   o  List of routing notifications being considered in the associated
      FIB change.  Each notification is defined as :
         Node ID of the near end of the link
         Node ID of the far end of the link
         Old Metric
         New Metric


7.  Fall back to Conventional Convergence

   In circumstances where a router detects that it is dealing with
   incomplete or inconsistent link state information, or when a further
   topology event is received before completion of the current ordered
   FIB update process, it may be expedient to abandon the controlled
   convergence process.  A number of possible fall back mechanisms are
   described in Appendix A.  This mechanism is referred to as
   "Abandoning All Hope (AAH).  The state machine defined in the body of
   this document does not make any assumption about which fall back
   mechanism will be used.

8.  oFIB state machine

   This section describes a model of an oFIB state machine which an
   implementation must be capable of interworking with.

   An oFIB capable router maintains an oFIB state value which can be one
   of : OFIB_STABLE, OFIB_HOLDING_DOWN, OFIB_HOLDING_UP, OFIB_ABANDONED,
   OFIB_ONGOING.

   An oFIB capable router maintains a timer, Hold_down_timer.  An oFIB
   capable router is configured with a value referred to as
   HOLD_DOWN_DURATION.  This configuration can be performed manually or
   using Appendix B.

   An oFIB capable router maintains a timer, rank_timer.

8.1.  OFIB_STABLE

   OFIB_STABLE is the state of a router which is not currently involved
   in any convergence process.  This router is ready to process an event
   by applying oFIB.

   EVENT : Reception of a link-state packet describing an event of the
   type link X--Y down or metric increase to be processed using oFIB.

   ACTION : Set state to OFIB_HOLDING_DOWN.  Start Hold_down_timer.
   ofib_current_common_set = {X,Y}.  Compute rank with respect to the
   event, as defined in Section 5.  Store Waiting List and Notification
   List for X--Y obtained from the rank computation.

   EVENT : Reception of a link-state packet describing an event of the
   type link X--Y up or metric decrease which to be processed using
   oFIB.

   ACTION :

        Set state to OFIB_HOLDING_UP.
        Start Hold_down_timer.
        ofib_current_common_set = {X,Y}
        Compute rank with respect to the event, as defined in section
        Section 5 .
        Store Waiting List and Notification List for X--Y obtained from
        the rank computation.

8.2.  OFIB_HOLDING_DOWN

   OFIB_HOLDING_DOWN is the state of a router that is collecting a set
   of link down or metric increase link-state packets to be processed

   EVENT : Reception of a link-state packet describing an event of the
   type link up or metric decrease which in itself can be processed
   using oFIB.

   ACTION :

        Set state to OFIB_ABANDONED.
        Reset Hold_down_timer.
        Trigger AAH mechanism

   EVENT : Reception of a link-state packet describing an event of the
   type link A--B down or metric increase which in itself can be
   processed using oFIB.

   ACTION :

        ofib_current_common_set =
        intersection(ofib_current_common_set,{A,B}).
        If ofib_current_common_set is empty, then there is no longer a
        node in common in all the pending link-state changes.
             Set state to OFIB_ABANDONED
             Reset Hold_down_timer
             Trigger AAH mechanism.
        If ofib_current_common set is not empty, update waiting list and
        notification list as defined in Section 5.  Note that in the
        case of a single link event, the link-state packet received when
        the router is in this state describes the state change of the
        other direction of the link, hence no changes will be made to
        the waiting and notification lists.

   EVENT : Hold_down_timer expires.

   ACTION :

        Set state to OFIB_ONGOING.
        Start rank_timer with computed rank.

   EVENT : Reception of a completion message

   ACTION : Remove the sender from waiting list associated with the
   event identified in the completion message.

8.3.  OFIB_HOLDING_UP

   OFIB_HOLDING_UP is the state of a router that is collecting a set of
   link up or metric decrease link-state packets to be processed

   ACTION :

        ofib_current_common_set =
        intersection(ofib_current_common_set,{A,B}).
        If ofib_current_common_set is empty, then there is no longer a
        common node in the set of pending link-state changes.
             Set state to OFIB_ABANDONED.
             Reset Hold_down_timer.
             Trigger AAH mechanism.
        If ofib_current_common set is not empty, update waiting list and
        notification list as defined in Section 5.  Note that in the
        case of a single link event, the link-state packet received when
        the router is in this state describes the state change of the
        other direction of the link, hence no changes will be made to
        the waiting and notification lists.

   EVENT : Reception of a completion message

   ACTION : Remove the sender from the waiting list associated with the
   event identified in the completion message.

   EVENT : Hold_down_timer expires.

   ACTION :

        Set state to OFIB_ONGOING.
        Start rank_timer with computed rank.

8.4.  OFIB_ONGOING

   OFIB_ONGOING is the state of a router that is applying the ordering
   mechanism w.r.t. the set of Link State Packets (LSP) collected when
   in OFIB_HOLDING_DOWN or OFIB_HOLDING_UP state.

   EVENT : rank_timer expires or waiting list becomes empty.

   ACTION :

        Perform FIB updates according to the change.
        Send completion message to each member of the notification list.

   OFIB_ABANDONED is the state of a router that has fallen back to fast
   convergence due to the reception of link-state packets that cannot be
   dealt together using oFIB.

   such considerations will be called out in protocol specific documents
   defining the modification to any routing protocol that is to be
   enhanced to support loop-free convergence using ordered FIB.

   risks.  However a full security analysis would need to be provided

Appendix A.  Mechanisms for Safely Abandoning Loop-Free Convergence
             (AAH)

   IPFRR[RFC5714] and loop-free convergence techniques [RFC5715] can
   deal with single topology change events, multiple correlated change
   events, and in some cases even certain uncorrelated events.  However,
   in all cases there are events which cannot be dealt with and the
   mechanism needs to quickly revert to normal convergence.  This is
   known as "Abandoning All Hope" (AAH).

   This appendix describes the outcome of a design study into the AAH
   problem, and is included here to trigger discussion on the trade-offs
   between complexity and robustness in the AAH solution-space.

A.1.  Possible Solutions

   Two approaches to this problem have been proposed:

   1.  Hold-down timer only.

   2.  Synchronization of AAH state using AAH messages.

   These are described below.

A.2.  Hold-down timer only

   This method uses a hold-down to acquire a set of LSPs which should be
   processed together.  On expiry of the local hold-down timer, the
   router begins processing the batch of LSPs according to the loop free
   prevention algorithm.

   There are a number of problems with this simple approach.  In some
   cases the timer value will be too short to ensure that all the
   related events have arrived at all routers (perhaps because there was
   some unexpected propagation delay, or one or more of the events are
   slow in being detected).  In other cases, a completely unrelated
   event may occur after the timer has expired, but before the
   processing is complete.  In addition, since the timer is started at
   each router on reception of the first LSP announcing a topology
   change, the actual starting time is dependant upon the propagation
   time of the first LSP.  So, for a subsequent event occurring around
   the time of the timer expiry, because of variations in propagation
   delay it may reach some routers before the timer expires and others
   after it has expired.  In the former case this LSP will be included
   in the set of changes to be considered, while in the latter it will
   be excluded leasing to serious routing inconsistency.  In such cases
   continuing to operate the loop-free convergence protocol may
   exacerbate the situation.



Shand, et al.             Expires July 8, 2013                 [Page 18]

Internet-Draft      Loop-free convergence using oFIB        January 2013


   The simple approach to this would be to revert to normal convergence
   (AAH) whenever an LSP is received after the timer has expired.
   However this also has problems for the reasons above and therefore
   AAH must be a synchronous operation, i.e. it is necessary to arrange
   that an AAH invoked anywhere in the network causes ALL routers to
   AAH.

   It is also necessary to consider the means of exiting the AAH state.
   Again the simplest method is to use a timer.  However while in AAH
   state any topology changes previously received, or which are
   subsequently received, should be processed immediately using the
   traditional convergence algorithms i.e. without invoking controlled
   convergence.  If the exit from the AAH state is not correctly
   synchronized, a new event may be processed by some routers
   immediately (as AAH), while those which have already left AAH state
   will treat it as the first of a new batch of changes and attempt
   controlled convergence.  Thus both entry and exit from the AAH state
   needs to be synchronised.  A method of achieving this is described in
   Appendix A.3.

A.3.  AAH messages

   Like the simple timer AAH method, this method uses a hold-down to
   acquire a set of LSPs which should be processed together.  On expiry
   of the local hold-down timer, the router begins processing the batch
   of LSPs according to the loop free prevention algorithm.  This is the
   same behaviour as the hold-down timer only method.  However, if any
   router, having started the loop-free convergence process receives an
   LSP which would trigger a topology change, it locally abandons the
   controlled convergence process, and sends an AAH message to all its
   neighbors.  This eventually triggers all routers to abandon the
   controlled convergence.  The routers remain in AAH state (i.e.
   processing topology changes using normal "fast" convergence), until a
   period of quiescence has elapsed.  The exit from AAH state is
   synchronized by using a two step process.  To achieve the required
   synchronization, two additional messages are required, AAH and AAH
   ACK.  The AAH message is reliably exchanged between neighbours using
   the AAH ACK message.  These could be implemented as a new message
   within the routing protocol or carried in existing routing hello
   messages.  Two types of state machines are needed.  A per-router AAH
   state machine and a per neighbour AAH state machine(PNSM).  These are
   described below.

   Operation of the per-router state machine is as follows:

   Operation of this state machine under normal topology change involves
   only states: Quiescent (Q), Hold-down (Hold) and Controlled
   Convergence (CC).  The remaining states are associated with an AAH
   event.

   The resting state is Quiescent.  When the router in the Quiescent
   state receives an LSP indicating a topology change, which would
   normally trigger an SPF, it starts the Hold-down timer and changes
   state to Hold-down.  It normally remains in this state, collecting
   additional LSPs until the Hold-down timer expires.  Note that all
   routers must use a common value for the Hold-down timer.  When the
   Hold-down timer expires the router then enters Controlled Convergence
   (CC) state and executes the CC mechanism to re-converge the topology.
   When the CC process has completed on the router, the router re-enters
   the Quiescent state.

   If this router receives a topology changing LSP whilst it is in the
   CC state, it enters AAH state, and sends a "goto TX-AAH" command to
   all per neighbour state machines which causes each per-neighbour

   state machine to signal this state change to its neighbour.
   Alternatively, if this router receives an AAH message from any of its
   neighbors whilst in any state except AAH, it starts the AAH timer and
   enters the AAH state.  The per neighbor state machine corresponding
   to the neighbor from which the AAH was received executes the RX AAH
   action (which causes it to send an AAH ACK), while the remainder are
   sent the "goto TX-AAH" command.  The result is that the AAH is
   acknowledged to the neighbor from which it was received and
   propagated to all other neighbors.  On entering AAH state, all CC
   timers are expired and normal convergence takes place.

   Whilst in the AAH state, LSPs are processed in the traditional
   manner.  Each time an LSP is received, the AAH timer is restarted.
   In an unstable network ALL routers will remain in this state for some
   time and the network will behave in the traditional uncontrolled
   convergence manner.

   When the AAH timer expires, the router enters AAH-hold state and
   starts the AAH hold timer.  The purpose of the AAH-hold state is to
   synchronize the transition of the network from AAH to Quiescent.  The
   additional state ensures that the network cannot contain a mixture of
   routers in both AAH and Quiescent states.  If, whilst in AAH-Hold
   state the router receives a topology changing LSP, it re-enters AAH
   state and commands all per neighbour state machines to "goto TX-AAH".
   If, whilst in AAH-Hold state the router receives an AAH message from
   one of its neighbours, it re-enters the AAH state and commands all
   other per neighbour state machines to "goto TX-AAH".  Note that the
   per-neighbor state machine receiving the AAH message will
   autonomously acknowledge receipt of the AAH message.  Commanding the
   per-neighbour state machine to "goto TX-AAH" is necessary, because
   routers may be in a mixture of Quiescent, Hold-down and AAH-hold
   state, and it is necessary to rendezvous the entire network back to
   AAH state.

   When the AAH Hold timer expires the router changes to state Quiescent
   and is ready for loop free convergence.

   There is one instance of the per-neighbour (PN) state machine for
   each neighbour within the convergence control domain.

   The normal state is IDLE.

   On command ("goto TX-AAH") from the router state machine, the state
   machine enters TX-AAH state, transmits an AAH message to its
   neighbour and starts a timer.

   On receipt of an AAH ACK in state TX-AAH the state machine cancels
   the timer and enters IDLE state.

   In states IDLE, any AAH ACK message received is ignored.

   On expiry of the timer in state TX-AAH the state machine transmits an
   AAH message to the neighbour and restarts the timer.  (The timer
   cannot expire in any other state.)

   In any state, receipt of an AAH causes the state machine to transmit
   an AAH ACK and enter the IDLE state.

   Note that for correct operation the state machine must remain in
   state TX-AAH, until an AAH ACK or an AAH is received, or the state
   machine is deleted.  Deletion of the per neighbor state machine
   occurs when routing determines that the neighbour has gone away, or
   when the interface goes away.

   When routing detects a new neighbour it creates a new instance of the
   per-neighbour state machine in state Idle.  The consequent generation
   of the router's own LSP will then cause the router state machine to

   execute the LSP receipt actions, which will if necessary result in
   the new per-neighbour state machine receiving a "goto TX-AAH" command
   and transitioning to TX-AAH state.


Appendix B.  Synchronisation of Loop Free Timer Values

   The Appendix provided the reader with access to the design
   considerations originally described in
   [I-D.atlas-bryant-shand-lf-timers] .

B.1.  Introduction

   Most of the loop-free convergence mechanisms [RFC5715] require one or
   more convergence delay timers that must have a duration that is
   consistent throughout the routing domain.  This time is the worst
   case time that any router will take to calculate the new topology,
   and to make the necessary changes to the FIB.  The timer is used by
   the routers to know when it is safe to transition between the loop-
   free convergence states.  The time taken by a router to complete each
   phase of the loop-free transition will be dependent on the size of
   the network and the design and implementation of the router.  It can
   therefore be expected that the optimum delay will need to be tuned
   from time to time as the network evolves.  Manual configuration of
   the timer is fraught for two reasons, firstly it is always difficult
   to ensure that the correct value is installed in all of the routers,
   and secondly, if any change is introduced into the network that
   results in a need to change the timer, for example due to a change in
   hardware or software version, then all of the routers need to be
   reconfigured to use the new timer value.  It is therefore desirable
   that a means be provided by which the convergence delay timer can be
   automatically synchronized throughout the network.

B.2.  Required Properties

   The timer synchronization mechanism must have the following
   properties:

   o  The convergence delay time must be consistent amongst all routers
      that are converging on the new topology.
   o  The convergence delay time must be the highest delay required by
      any router in the new topology.
   o  The mechanism must increase the delay when a new router in
      introduced to the network that requires a higher delay than is
      currently in use.
   o  When the router that had the longest delay requirements is removed
      from the topology, the convergence delay timer value must, within
      some reasonable time, be reduced to the longest delay required by



Shand, et al.             Expires July 8, 2013                 [Page 23]

      the remaining routers.
   o  It must be possible for a router to change the convergence delay
      timer value that it requires.
   o  A router which is in multiple routing areas, or is running
      multiple routing protocols may signal a different loop-free
      convergence delay for each area, and for each protocol.
   How a router determines the time that it needs to execute each
   convergence phase is an implementation issue, and outside the scope
   of this specification.  However a router that dynamically determines
   its proposed timer value must do so in such a way that it does not
   cause the synchronized value to continually fluctuate.

B.3.  Mechanism

   The following mechanism is proposed.

   A new information element is introduced into the routing protocol
   that specifies the maximum time (in milliseconds) that the router
   will take to calculate the new topology and to update its FIB as a
   result of any topology change.

   When a topology change occurs, the largest convergence delay time
   required by any router in the new topology is used by the loop-free
   convergence mechanism.

   If a routing protocol message is issued that changes the convergence
   delay timer value, but does not change the topology, the new timer
   value must be taken into consideration during the next loop-free
   transition, but must not instigate a loop-free transition.

   If a routing protocol message is issued that changes the convergence
   timer value and changes the topology, a loop-free transition is
   instigated and the new timer value is taken into consideration.

   The loop-free convergence mechanism should specify the action to be
   taken if a timer change (only) message and a topology change message
   are independently generated during the hold-off time.  A suitable
   action would be to take the same action that would be taken if two
   uncorrelated topology changes occurred in the network.

   All routers that support loop-free convergence must advertise a loop-
   free convergence delay time.  The loop-free convergence mechanism
   must specify the action to be taken if a router does not advertise a
   convergence delay time.

Internet-Draft      Loop-free convergence using oFIB        January 2013


B.4.  Security Considerations

   If an abnormally large timer value is proposed by a router, the there
   is a danger that the loop-free convergence process will take an
   excessive time.  If during that time the routing protocol signals the
   need for another transition, the loop-free transition will be
   abandoned and the default best case (traditional) convergence
   mechanism used.

   It is still undesirable that the routers select a convergence delay
   time that has an excessive value.  The maximum value that can be
   specified in the LSP/LSA is limited through the use of a 16 bit field
   to about 65 seconds.  When sufficient implementation experience is
   gained, an architectural constant will be specified which sets the
   upper limit of the convergence delay timer.

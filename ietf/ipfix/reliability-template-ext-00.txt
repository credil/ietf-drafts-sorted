Internet-Draft      Reliability Extension for IPFIX     December 4, 2009


   IPFIX[RFC3917] mandates the IPFIX device should be reliable.To be
   reliable the individual components like the Metering process or the
   Exporting process should not fail to meter & export the flow
   information to the collector, else indicate its incapability
   explicitly.

   Currently, IPFIX transmits failure by sending count of packets,flows
   it failed to process along with the duration of the failure.

   This document outlines some of the limitations an IPFIX device may
   have and suggests solutions.

1.  Introduction

   Every IPFIX Observation point is associated with at least one
   Metering process. The records generated by the Metering process is
   exported as flow-records by a Exporting Process. To ensure correct
   measurement of flows-records IPFIX mandates the IPFIX device to be
   reliable. To be reliable the IPFIX device should either always meter
   or export the packets else indicate its inability to do so.

   The Metering Process sends it incapacity to meter in the form of
   ignoredpacket counts, time duration etc. [RFC5101] as the Reliablity
   Information. The Exporting Process similarly sends this Reliability
   information using notSentFlow counts, time duration etc. [RFC5101] as
   the Reliability Information.

   The conditions under which Metering and Exporting process send this
   Information could range from Overload behavior, user intervention to
   Soft-reset.

   This document outlines these cases and the limitations an IPFIX
   device may have in sending Reliability Information with suggested
   solutions.

2.  Reliability Information Template

   The Metering Process sends reliability information using the
   Reliability Statistics Option Templates Section 4.2 & 4.3 [RFC5101].
   This optional template SHOULD contain observationDomainId,
   ignoredPacketTotalCount, ignoredOctetTotalCount, time first ignored,
   time last ignored & optionally meteringProcessId. Similarly, the
   Exporting Process sends reliability information using the Exporting
   Process Statistics Option Template [RFC5101]. This optional template
   SHOULD contain ExportingProcessId, notSentFlowTotalCount,
   notSentPacketTotalCount, notSentOctetTotalCount ,time first flow
   dropped, time last flow dropped.

   These optional template are sent either periodically or based on some
   export policy.

   The statistics may get incremented during;
      1. Overload behavior

         Where a device when under overload may choose not to meter or
         export packets for a defined duration.

      2. Device State

         Where the metering process has failed to meter owing to
         dependency on other processes or on the device state.

   In all of the above cases it is assumed that the Metering process or
   the Exporting process will manage to gather all the required
   statistics and send it to the Collector.

   However; in certain specific states the device MAYBE unable to gather
   the required data, For example;

      1. Overload Behavior

         Here a device maybe unable to collect any data, until the
         system is out of Overload. This maybe the case for small scale
         devices.

      2. Device State

         Here a process may undergo for example a soft-restart
         preventing any statistics collection. Soft restart often is a
         planned restart.

   However, in order for the IPFIX device to be reliable, it should
   still at least send the duration for which the device could not

3.  Existing format of Reliability Information Template and Proposed
   change

   The existing Reliability Template is split across two templates some
   for the Metering process reliability Section 4.2, [RFC5101] and other
   for Exporting process reliability Section 4.3, [RFC5101].
      1. observationDomainId- this is sent in the metering process's
      reliability template.

      2. time first ignored- this is time stamp of the first IP packet
      which was ignored by the Metering Process.

      3. time last ignored- this is time stamp of the last IP packet
      that was ignored by the Metering Process.

      4. ignoredPacketTotalCount- the total number of IP packets that
      the Metering Process did not process.

      5. ignoredOctetTotalCount- the total number of octets that the
      Metering Process did not process.

      6. meteringProcessId- this is sent in the Metering Process's
      reliability template.

      7. exportingProcessId- this is sent in the Exporting Process's
      reliability template.

      8. notSentFlowTotalCount- the total number of flows dropped by the
      Exporting Process.

      9. notSentPacketTotalCount- the total number of packets dropped by
      the Exporting Process.

      10.notSentOctetTotalCount- the total number of octets in packets
      dropped by the Exporting Process.

      11.time first flow dropped- this is the time stamp when the first
      flow was dropped by the Exporting Process.

      12.time last flow dropped- this is the time stamp when the last
      flow was dropped by the Exporting Process.

   In the event a IPFIX device is unable to accumulate counters for
   items (4),(5),(8),(9) & (10) above, as it may happen and is described
   in Section 2, it is proposed it SHOULD still send the time duration
   for which it was unable to meter using Items (2) & (3) or (11) & (12)
   above, in addition to which it is  MUST also send a "reasoncode" in a
   new Information Element, informing the collector process of its

   incapacity to collect any data.

   This new Information Element is called as "reliabilityReasonCode",
   and is defined below. It essentially carries information conveying
   the device status as to when the reliability information was
   collected.

4.  reliabilityReasonCode

   Description:   The reason code specifies the value matching the state
   of the IPFIX Device sending the Reliability Options template. It MUST
   have the one of the following values;
   0x00:    General - This value is used when the device increments
   reliability statistics on account of Overload, User Intervention etc.
   In this state the device is assumed to have the capacity to
   accumulate all counters.
   0x01:    Reset  - This value is used when the device sends
   reliability statistics but has been unable to accumulate any or all
   counters.
   Abstract Data Type: unsigned8
   ElementId: 239
   Status: current
   Units: range {0-1}

5.  Usage & interpretation of reliabilityReasonCode

   According to the IPFIX protocol specification [RFC5101], the Metering
   Process SHOULD send Reliability Options Template as defined in
   Section 4.2, [RFC5101] and the Exporting Process should send the
   Reliability Options template as in Section 4.3, [RFC5101]. Following
   are the changes suggested;

      1. Metering Process Reliability Statistics Option template SHOULD
      Contain the additional Information Element,
      "reliabilityReasonCode" If the value of this Information Element
      is "Reset", the IPFIX device MAY not provide
      "ignoredPacketTotalCount" and "ignoredOctetTotalCount" fields, it
      MUST provide the "time first ignored" and "time last ignored". If
      the value of the Information Element is "General", the IPFIX
      device is to follow the specification as in Section 4.2, [RFC5101]

      2. Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Option template SHOULD
      Contain the additional Information Element,
      "reliabilityReasonCode" If the value of this Information Element
      is "Reset", the IPFIX device MAY not provide
      "notSentFlowTotalCount", "notSentPacketTotalCount" and
      "notSentOctetTotalCount" fields, it MUST provide the "time first
      flow dropped" and "time last flow dropped". If the value of the
      Information Element is "General", the IPFIX device is to follow
      the specification as in Section 4.3, [RFC5101].

   The Collector Process SHOULD ignore the counter fields if the
   "reliabilityReasonCode" value is "Reset" for both Metering and
   Exporting Process reliability templates. The Collector Process may
   choose to interpret the time duration received in the template as a

   reset period and thus having no flow data, or approximate the flow
   data lost in the duration.

6.  Security Considerations

   This draft does not directly introduce any security issues, other
   than that in [RFC5102].

7.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Gerhard Muenz for review and Juergen
   Quittek for support.

8.  IANA Considerations 

   This document specifies a new IPFIX Information Element. The proposed
   Information Element "reliabilityReasonCode" does not duplicate any
   Existing Information Elements. The proposed Information Element value
   is XXX, Section 4,[RFC5102] and is subject to Expert Review[RFC5226].

   The value of XXX will be replaced as per IANA recommendation.

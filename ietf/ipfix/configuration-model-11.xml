			<vspace blankLines="0" />
			We (the authors) decided not to add such parameters for the following reasons: 1) the composition of IPFIX Messages has not been described as configurable or managable in any other IPFIX document, and 2) today's configuration possibilities depend very much on the device or manufacturer. We propose to use device or manufacturer-dependent extensions of the configuration data model.

                Editor's note (to be removed prior to publication):

		IPFIX and PSAMP compliant Monitoring Devices (routers, switches, monitoring probes, Collectors etc.) offer various configuration possibilities that allow adapting network monitoring to the goals and purposes of the application, such as accounting and charging, traffic analysis, performance monitoring, security monitoring.
		The use of a common vendor-independent configuration data model for IPFIX and PSAMP compliant Monitoring Devices facilitates network management and configuration, especially if Monitoring Devices of different implementers or manufacturers are deployed simultaneously.
		On the one hand, a vendor-independent configuration data model helps storing and managing the configuration data of Monitoring Devices in a consistent format.
		On the other hand, it can be used for local and remote configuration of Monitoring Devices.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		The purpose of this document is the specification of a vendor-independent configuration data model that covers the commonly available configuration parameters of Selection Processes, Caches, Exporting Processes, and Collecting Processes.
                In addition, it includes common states parameters of a Monitoring Device.
                The configuration data model is defined using UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagrams <xref target="UML"/> while the actual configuration data is encoded in Extensible Markup Language (XML) <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126"/>.
                An XML document conforming to the configuration data model contains the configuration data of one Monitoring Device.
	    </t>
	    <t>
                The configuration data model is designed for being used with the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/> in order to configure remote Monitoring Devices.
                With the NETCONF protocol, it is possible to transfer a complete set of configuration data to a Monitoring Device, to query the current configuration and state parameters of a Monitoring Device, and to change specific parameter values of an existing Monitoring Device configuration.
            </t>
            <t>
                In order to ensure compatibility with the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/>, YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> is used to formally specify the configuration data model.
                If required, the YANG specification of the configuration data model can be converted into XML Schema language <xref target="W3C.REC-xmlschema-0-20041028"/> or DSDL (Document Schema Definition Languages) <xref target="RFC6110"/>, for example by using the pyang tool <xref target="YANG-WEB"/>.
                YANG provides mechanisms to adapt the configuration data model to device-specific constraints and to augment the model with additional device-specific or vendor-specific parameters. 
                <!--
		On the other hand, the configuration data model optional parameters not supported by a particular monitoring device implementation can be simply omitted in the XML document.
		However, for the creation and manipulation of configuration data for a specific monitoring device, any restrictions and extensions of the data model should be known.
	        This is to avoid the generation of unsupported configuration data and to profit from extended device capabilities.
		Note that the description of monitoring device capabilities is currently out of scope of this document.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		For the configuration of remote Monitoring Devices, an appropriate protocol is needed to transfer the XML encoded configuration data.
                The configuration data model is compatible with the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC4741"/>.
                However, alternative protocols, such as the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) <xref target="W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20070427"/>, are also suitable for transferring XML data from a network management system to a Monitoring Device.

		<t>
		    The IPFIX protocol <xref target="RFC5101"/> provides network administrators with access to IP Flow information.  
		    The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting Process is defined in <xref target="RFC5470"/>, per the requirements defined in <xref target="RFC3917"/>.
		    The IPFIX protocol <xref target="RFC5101"/> specifies how IPFIX Data Records and Templates are carried via a number of transport protocols from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX Collecting Process.  
		    IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, their name, type and additional semantic information, as specified in <xref target="RFC5102"/>.
		    <xref target="RFC6615"/> specifies the IPFIX Management Information Base, consisting of the IPFIX MIB module and the IPFIX SELECTOR MIB module.
		    Finally, <xref target="RFC5472"/> describes what type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they can use the information provided.  
		    It furthermore shows how the IPFIX framework relates to other architectures and frameworks. 
                    Methods for efficient export of bidirectional Flow information and common properties in Data Records are specified in <xref target="RFC5103"/> and <xref target="RFC5473"/>, respectively.
                    <xref target="RFC5610"/> addresses the export of extended type information for enterprise-specific Information Elements.
		    The storage of IPFIX Messages in a file is specified in <xref target="RFC5655"/>.
		</t>
	    </section>

	    <section title="PSAMP Documents Overview">
		<t>
		    The framework for packet selection and reporting <xref target="RFC5474"/> enables network elements to select subsets of packets by statistical and other methods, and to export a stream of reports on the selected packets to a Collector.  
		    The set of packet selection techniques (Sampling, Filtering, and hashing) standardized by PSAMP are described in <xref target="RFC5475"/>.  
		    The PSAMP protocol <xref target="RFC5476"/> specifies the export of packet information from a PSAMP Exporting Process to a PSAMP Collector.  
                    Instead of exporting PSAMP Packet Reports, the stream of selected packets may also serve as input to the generation of IPFIX Flow Records.
		    Like IPFIX, PSAMP has a formal description of its Information Elements, their name, type and additional semantic information.  
		    The PSAMP information model is defined in <xref target="RFC5477"/>.  
		    <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipfix-psamp-mib"/> specifies the PSAMP MIB module as an extension of the IPFIX SELECTOR MIB module defined in <xref target="RFC6615"/>.

		The terms Metering Process and Exporting Process have different definitions in <xref target="RFC5101"/> and <xref target="RFC5476"/>.

			<vspace blankLines="1" />
			The Metering Process generates IPFIX Flow Records or PSAMP Packet Reports, depending on its deployment as part of an IPFIX Device or PSAMP Device.  
			Inputs to the process are packets observed at one or multiple Observation Points, as well as characteristics describing the packet treatment at these Observation Points.
                        If IPFIX Flow Records are generated, the Metering Process MUST NOT aggregate packets observed at different Observation Domains in the same Flow.
                        The function of the Metering Process is split into two functional blocks: Selection Process and Cache.

			<vspace blankLines="1" />
                        The Cache is a functional block in a Metering Process which generates IPFIX Flow Records or PSAMP Packet Reports from a Selected Packet Stream, in accordance with its configuration.
                        If Flow Records are generated, the Cache performs tasks like creating new records, updating existing ones, computing Flow statistics, deriving further Flow properties, detecting Flow expiration, passing Flow Records to the Exporting Process, and deleting Flow Records.
                        If Packet Reports are generated, the Cache performs tasks like extracting packet contents and derived packet properties from the Selected Packet Stream, creating new records, and passing them as Packet Reports to the Exporting Process.

                        The Cache Layout defines the superset of fields that are included in the Packet Reports or Flow Records maintained by the Cache.
                        The fields are specified by the corresponding Information Elements.
                        In general, the largest possible subset of the specified fields is derived for every Packet Report or Flow Record.
                        More specific rules about which fields must be included are given in <xref target="sec:cache-layout"/>.

                The IPFIX reference model in <xref target="RFC5470"/> describes Metering Processes, Exporting Processes, and Collecting Processes as functional blocks of IPFIX Devices. 
                The PSAMP framework <xref target="RFC5474"/> provides the corresponding information for PSAMP Devices and introduces the Selection Process as a functional block within Metering Processes.
		In <xref target="sec:terminology"/> of the document, the Cache is defined as another functional block within Metering Processes. 
                Further explanations about the relationship between Selection Process and Cache are given in <xref target="sec:metering-process"/>.
		IPFIX File Reader and File Writer are defined as specific kinds of Exporting and Collecting Processes in <xref target="RFC5655"/>.
	    </t>
	    <t>
                Monitoring Device implementations usually maintain the separation of various functional blocks although they do not necessarily implement all of them.
                Furthermore, they provide various configuration possibilities; some of them are specified as mandatory by the IPFIX protocol <xref target="RFC5101"/> or PSAMP protocol <xref target="RFC5476"/>.
		The configuration data model enables the setting of commonly available configuration parameters for Selection Processes, Caches, Exporting Processes, and Collecting Processes.
                In addition, it allows specifying the composition of functional blocks within a Monitoring Device configuration and their linkage with Observation Points.
	    </t>
            <t>
                The selection of parameters in the configuration data model is based on configuration issues discussed in the IPFIX and PSAMP documents <xref target="RFC3917"/>, <xref target="RFC5101"/>, <xref target="RFC5470"/>, <xref target="RFC5476"/>, <xref target="RFC5474"/>, and <xref target="RFC5475"/>.
                Furthermore, the structure and content of the IPFIX MIB module <xref target="RFC6615"/> and the PSAMP MIB module <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipfix-psamp-mib"/> have been taken into consideration.
                Consistency between the configuration data model and the IPFIX and PSAMP MIB modules is an intended goal.
                Therefore, parameters in the configuration data model are named according to corresponding managed objects. <!--, while names of the corresponding Information Elements in <xref target="RFC5102"/> or <xref target="RFC5477"/> should be adopted where they exist.-->
                Certain IPFIX MIB objects containing state data have been adopted as state parameters in the configuration data model.
                <!-- FIXME: by NMS? -->
                State parameters cannot be configured, yet their values can be queried from the Monitoring Device by a network manager.

                    In a Monitoring Device implementation, the functionality of the Metering Process is commonly split into packet Sampling and Filtering functions performed by Selection Processes, and the maintenance of Flow Records and Packet Reports performed by a Cache.

                    The configuration data model adopts the separation of Selection Processes and Caches in order to support the flexible configuration and combination of these functional blocks.
                    As defined in <xref target="RFC5476"/>, the Selection Process takes an Observed Packet Stream as its input and selects a subset of that stream as its output (Selected Packet Stream).
                    The action of the Selection Process on a single packet of its input is defined by one Selector (called Primitive Selector) or an ordered composition of multiple Selectors (called Composite Selector).
                    The Cache generates Flow Records or Packet Reports from the Selected Packet Stream, depending on its configuration.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The configuration data model does not allow configuring a Metering Process without any Selection Process in front of the Cache.
                    If all packets in the Observed Packet Stream shall be selected and passed to the Cache without any Filtering or Sampling, a Selection Process needs to be configured with a Selector which selects all packets ("SelectAll" class in <xref target="sec:selector"/>).
                </t>
                <t>
                    The configuration data model enables the configuration of a Selection Process which receives packets from multiple Observation Points as its input.
                    In this case, the Observed Packet Streams of the Observation Points are processed in independent Selection Sequences.
                    As specified in <xref target="RFC5476"/>, a distinct set of Selector instances needs to be maintained per Selection Sequence in order to keep the Selection States and statistics separate.
                </t>
                <t>
                    With the configuration data model, it is possible to configure a Metering Process with more than one Selection Processes whose output is processed by a single Cache.
                    This is illustrated in <xref target="fig:mp-architecture2" />.

                    The Observed Packet Streams at the input of a Metering Process may originate from Observation Points belonging to different Observation Domains.
                    By definition of the Observation Domain (see <xref target="RFC5101"/>), however, a Cache MUST NOT aggregate packets observed at different Observation Domains in the same Flow.
                    Hence, if the Cache is configured to generate Flow Records, it needs to distinguish packets according to their Observation Domains.

                    As an example, <xref target="fig:destination-example"/> shows the UML diagram of the SctpExporter class, which is specified in more detail in <xref target="sec:sctp-export"/>.
                    The upper box contains the name of the class.
                    The lower box lists the attributes of the class.
                    Each attribute corresponds to a parameter of the configuration data model.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Behind an attribute's name, there may appear a multiplicity indicator in brackets (i.e., between "[" and "]").
                    An attribute with multiplicity indicator "[0..1]" represents an OPTIONAL configuration parameter which is only included in the configuration data if the user configures it.
                    Typically, the absence of an OPTIONAL parameter has a specific meaning. 
                    For example, not configuring rateLimit in an object of the SctpExporter class means that no rate limiting will be applied to the exported data.
                    In YANG, an OPTIONAL parameter is specified as a "leaf" without "mandatory true" substatement.
                    The "description" substatement specifies the behavior for the case that the parameter is not configured.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The multiplicity indicator "[0..*]" means that this parameter is OPTIONAL and MAY be configured multiple times with different values.
                    In the example, multiple source IP addresses (sourceIPAddress) may be configured for a multi-homed Exporting Process.
                    In YANG, an attribute with multiplicity indicator "[0..*]" corresponds to a "leaf-list".
                </t>
                <t>
                    The multiplicity indicator "[1..*]" means that this parameter MUST be configured at least once and MAY be configured multiple times with different values.
                    In the example, one or more destination IP addresses (destinationIPAddress) must be configured to specify the export destination.
                    In YANG, an attribute with multiplicity indicator "[1..*]" corresponds to a "leaf-list" with "min-elements 1" substatement.
                    Note that attributes without this multiplicity indicator MUST NOT appear more than once in each object of the class.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Attributes without multiplicity indicator may be endued with a default value which is indicated behind the equality symbol ("=").
                    If a default value exists, the parameter does not have to be explicitly configured by the user.
                    If the parameter is not configured by the user, the Monitoring Device MUST use the specified default value for the given parameter.
                    In the example, IPFIX version 10 must be used unless a different value is configured for ipfixVersion.
                    In YANG, an attribute with default value corresponds to a "leaf" with "default" substatement.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In the example, there exist two default values for the destination port (destinationPort), namely the registered ports for IPFIX with and without transport layer security (i.e., DTLS or TLS), which are 4740 and 4739, respectively.
                    In the UML diagram, the two default values are separated by a vertical bar ("|"). 
                    In YANG, such conditional default value alternatives cannot be specified formally.
                    Instead, they are defined in the "description" substatement of the "leaf".
                </t>
                <t>
                    Further attribute properties are denoted in braces (i.e., between "{" and "}").
                    An attribute with property "{opt.}", such as sendBufferSize in the SctpExporter class, represents a parameter that MAY be configured by the user.
                    If not configured by the user, the Monitoring Device MUST set an appropriate value for this parameter at configuration time.
                    As a result, the parameter will always exist in the configuration data, yet it is not mandatory for the user to configure it.
                    This behavior can be implemented as a static device-specific default value, but does not have to.
                    Therefore, the user MUST NOT expect that the device always sets the same values for the same parameter.
                    Regardless of whether the parameter value has been configured by the user or set by the device, the parameter value MUST NOT be changed by the device after configuration.
                    Since this behavior cannot be specified formally in YANG, it is specified in the "description" substatement of the "leaf".
                </t>
                <t>
                    The availability of a parameter may depend on another parameter value.
                    In the UML diagram, such restrictions are indicated as attribute properties (e.g., "{SCTP only}").
                    The given example does not show such restrictions.
                    In YANG, the availability of a parameter is formally restricted with the "when" substatement of the "leaf".
                </t>
                <t>
                    Another attribute property not shown in the example is "{readOnly}" specifying state parameters which cannot be configured.
                    In YANG, this corresponds to the "config false" substatement.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Attributes without multiplicity indicator, without default value, and without "{readOnly}" property are mandatory configuration parameters.
                    These parameters MUST be configured by the user unless an attribute property determines that the parameter is not available.
                    In YANG, a mandatory parameter corresponds to a "leaf" with "mandatory true" substatement.
                    In the example, the user MUST configure the name parameter.
                </t>
                <t>
                    If some parameters are related to each other, it makes sense to group these parameters in a subclass.
                    This is especially useful if different subclasses represent choices of different parameter sets, or if the parameters of a subclass may appear multiple times.
                    For example, the SctpExporter class MAY contain the parameters of the TransportLayerSecurity subclass.
                </t>
                <t>
                    An object of a class is encoded as an XML element.
                    In order to distinguish between classes and objects, class names start with an upper case character while the associated XML elements start with lower case characters.
                    Parameters appear as XML elements which are nested in the XML element of the object.
                    In XML, the parameters of an object can appear in any order and do not have to follow the order in the UML class diagram.
                    Unless specified differently, the order in which parameters appear does not have a meaning.
                    As an example, an object of the SctpExporter class corresponds to one occurrence of

                    There are various possibilities how objects of classes can be related to each other.
                    In the scope of this document, we use two different types of relationship between objects: aggregation and unidirectional association.

                    Aggregation means that one object is part of the other object.
                    In <xref target="fig:uml" /> (a), an object of class B is part of an object of class A.
                    This corresponds to nested XML elements:

                    </artwork>
                    In the example, objects of the TransportLayerSecurity class and the TransportSession class appear as nested XML elements &lt;transportLayerSecurity&gt; and &lt;transportSession&gt; within an object of the SctpExporter class &lt;sctpExporter&gt;.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A unidirectional association is a reference to an object.
                    In <xref target="fig:uml" /> (b), an object of class A contains a reference to an object of class B.
                    This corresponds to separate XML elements that are not nested. 
                    To distinguish different objects of class B, class B must have a key.
                    In the configuration data model, keys are string parameters called "name", corresponding to XML elements &lt;name&gt;.
                    The names MUST be unique within the given XML subtree.
                    The reference to a specific object of class B is encoded with an XML element &lt;b&gt; which contains the name of an object.
                    If an object of class A refers to the object of class B with name "foo", this looks as follows:

                    In the case of aggregation, the multiplicity indicates how many objects of one class may be included in one object of the other class.
                    In <xref target="fig:uml" /> (a), an object of class A may contain an arbitrary number of objects of class B.
                    In the case of unidirectional association, the multiplicity at the arrowhead specifies the number of objects of a given class that may be referred to. 
                    The multiplicity at the arrow tail specifies how many different objects of one class may refer to a single object of the other class.
                    In <xref target="fig:uml" /> (b), an object of class A refers to single object of class B.
                    One object of class B can be referred to from an arbitrary number of objects of class A.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Similar to classes that are referenced in UML associations, classes which contain configuration parameters and which occur in an aggregation relationship with multiplicity greater than one must have a key.
                    This key is necessary because every configuration parameter must be addressable in order to manipulate or delete it.
                    The key values MUST be unique in the given XML subtree (i.e., unique within the aggregating object).
                    Hence, if class B in <xref target="fig:uml" /> (a) contains a configuration parameter, all objects of class B belonging to the same object of class A must have different key values.
                    Again, the key appears as an attribute called "name" in the concerned classes.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A class which contains state parameters but no configuration parameters, such as the Template class (see <xref target="sec:template"/>), does not have a key.
                    This is because state parameters cannot be manipulated or deleted, and therefore do not need to be addressable.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Note that the usage of keys as described above is required by YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> which mandates the existence of a key for elements which appear in a list of configuration data.
                    <!--In the configuration data model, the key is a string parameter called "name" in all concerned classes, corresponding to XML elements &lt;name&gt; in the XML document.
                    Note that the "name" parameters are not displayed in the UML class diagrams.
                    Arbitrary annotations can be assigned to the main classes of the data model using string attributes named "description".
                    Values of this attribute have no effect on the configuration and purely serve to provide some context information to the (human) reader.-->
                </t>
                <t>
                    The configuration data model for IPFIX and PSAMP makes use of unidirectional associations to specify the data flow between different functional blocks.
                    For example, if the output of a Selection Process is processed by a Cache, this corresponds to an object of the SelectionProcess class that contains a reference to an object of the Cache class.
                    The configuration data model does not mandate that such a reference exists for every functional block that has an output.
                    If such a reference is absent, the output is dropped without any further processing.
		    <!--The motivation for allowing such incomplete configurations is that stand-by processes can be specified.-->
		    Although such configurations are incomplete, we do not consider them as invalid as they may temporarily occur if a Monitoring Device is configured in multiple steps.
		    Also, it might be useful to pre-configure certain functions of a Monitoring Device in order to be able to switch to a new configuration more quickly.

	    <t>
		<list style="symbols">
		    <t>
                        The ObservationPoint class specifies an Observation Point (i.e., an interface or linecard) of the Monitoring Device at which packets are captured for traffic measurements.
			An object of the ObservationPoint class may be associated with one or more objects of the SelectionProcess class configuring Selection Processes that process the observed packets in parallel.
                        As long as an ObservationPoint object is specified without any references to SelectionProcess objects, the captured packets are not considered by any Metering Process.

			<vspace blankLines="1" />

                        The SelectionProcess class contains the configuration and state parameters of a Selection Process.
                        The Selection Process may be composed of a single Selector or a sequence of Selectors, defining a Primitive or Composite Selector, respectively.
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
                        <!-- FIXME: only one OP at the input of a Selection Process, agreed by Atsushi -->
                        The Selection Process selects packets from one or more Observed Packet Streams, each originating from a different Observation Point.
                        Therefore, a SelectionProcess object MAY be referred to from one or more ObservationPoint objects.
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
                        A Selection Process MAY pass the Selected Packet Stream to a Cache.
                        Therefore, the SelectionProcess class contains a reference to an object of the Cache class.
			If a Selection Process is configured without any reference to a Cache, the selected packets are not accounted in any Packet Report or Flow Record.
                        <!-- FIXME: possible explanation, currently not added

			The Cache class contains configuration and state parameters of a Cache.

			Therefore, an object of the Cache class MAY be referred to from multiple SelectionProcess objects.
                        <!-- FIXME: remove because of change in IPFIX-MIB
                        However, the configuration MUST ensure that all packets entering the Selection Process have been observed at Observation Points belonging to the same Observation Domain.
                        -->
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
			Configuration parameters of the Cache class specify the size of the Cache, the Cache Layout, and expiration parameters if applicable. 
			The Cache configuration also determines whether Packet Reports or Flow Records are generated. 
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
                        A Cache MAY pass its output to one or multiple Exporting Process.

			<!--
			A Cache object without any reference to an ExportingProcess object represents a standby Cache.

			If a Cache object does not specify any reference to an ExportingProcess object, the Cache output is dropped.

		As can be seen in <xref target="fig:classes" />, the MeteringProcess class defines references to instances of the SelectionProcess class and the Cache class.
		It acts as an envelope element specifying a series of Selection Processes, forming a Selection Sequence, and a record cache.  
                The order in which the user specifies Selection Processes in the XML document corresponds to the order in which they are applied.
                Hence, by using UML associations instead of aggregation relationships, the same Selection Processes and record caches can be deployed in different Metering Processes.
		An example is given in <xref target="sec:psamp-example" />.
		The MeteringProcess class itself is not instantiated, but specified as part of the ObservationPoint class.
		Using the same Metering Process with different Observation Points is achieved by referring to the same instances of the SelectionProcess class and the Cache class. 
		Considering Selection Processes and Cache Parameters as instances (and not the complete Metering Process) corresponds to the common practice to implement Selection Processes and record caches as independent modules. 
	    </t>
	    <t>
		The Cache class refers to instances of the ExportingProcess class, which enables using the same Exporting Process for different Metering Processes.

                    An instance of ObservationPoint class defines which location is associated with a specific Observation Point.
		    For this purpose, interfaces and physical entities are identified using their names.
		    Alternatively, index values of the corresponding entries in the ifTable (IF-MIB module <xref target="RFC2863"/>) or the entPhysicalTable (ENTITY-MIB modules <xref target="RFC4133"/>) can be used as identifiers. 
                    However, indices SHOULD only be used as identifiers if an SNMP agent on the same Monitoring Device enables access to the corresponding MIB tables.

                    Selection Sequence IDs are assigned by the Monitoring Device.
                    As state parameters, the SelectionProcess class contains a list of (observationDomainId, selectionSequenceId) tuples specifying the assigned Selection Sequence IDs and corresponding Observation Domain IDs.

		    <t>
			<list style="hanging">
			    <t hangText="activeTimeout:">
				This parameter configures the time in seconds after which a Flow is expired even though packets matching this Flow are still received by the Cache.

                        A Cache generates and maintains Packet Reports or Flow Records containing information that has been extracted from the incoming stream of packets.
                        Using the CacheField class, the CacheLayout class specifies the superset of fields that are included in the Packet Reports or Flow Records (see <xref target="fig:cache-layout"/>).
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        If Packet Reports are generated (i.e., if ImmediateCache class is used to configure the Cache), every field specified by the Cache Layout MUST be included in the resulting Packet Report unless the corresponding Information Element is not applicable or cannot be derived from the content or treatment of the incoming packet.
                        Any other field specified by the Cache Layout MAY only be included in the Packet Report if it is obvious from the field value itself or from the values of other fields in same Packet Report that the field value was not determined from the packet.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        <!-- FIXME: example as proposed by Lothar -->
                        For example, if a field is configured to contain the TCP source port (Information Element tcpSourcePort <xref target="RFC5102"/>), the field MUST be included in all Packet Reports which are related to TCP packets. 
                        Although the field value cannot be determined for non-TCP packets, the field MAY be included in the Packet Reports if another field contains the transport protocol identifier (Information Element protocolIdentifier <xref target="RFC5102"/>).
                    </t>
                    <t>
			If Flow Records are generated (i.e., if TimeoutCache, NaturalCache, or PermanentCache class is used to configure the Cache), the Cache Layout differentiates between Flow Key fields and non-key fields.
			Every Flow Key field specified by the Cache Layout MUST be included as Flow Key in the resulting Flow Record unless the corresponding Information Element is not applicable or cannot be derived from the content or treatment of the incoming packet. 
                        Any other Flow Key field specified by the Cache Layout MAY only be included in the Flow Record if it is obvious from the field value itself or from the values of other Flow Key fields in same Flow Record that the field value was not determined from the packet.
                        <!-- FIXME: change proposed by Lothar 
                        Two packets MUST be accounted by different Flow Records if different subsets of the Flow Key fields are applicable or derivable.
                        Two packets MUST be accounted by different Flow Records if they differ in at least one Flow Key field.
                        Paul proposes to put this in a positive form (23.03.10):
                        -->
                        Two packets are accounted by the same Flow Record if none of their Flow Key fields differ.
                        If a Flow Key field can be determined for one packet but not for the other, the two packets are accounted in different Flow Records.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Every non-key field specified by the Cache Layout MUST be included in the resulting Flow Record unless the corresponding Information Element is not applicable or cannot be derived for the given Flow. 
                        Any other non-key field specified by the Cache Layout MAY only be included in the Flow Record if it is obvious from the field value itself or from the values of other fields in same Flow Record that the field value was not determined from the packet.
                        Packets which are accounted by the same Flow Record may differ in their non-key fields, or one or more of the non-key fields can be undetermined for all or some of the packets.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        For example, if a non-key field specifies an Information Element whose value is determined by the first packet observed within a Flow (which is the default rule according to <xref target="RFC5102"/> unless specified differently in the description of the Information Element), this field MUST be included in the resulting Flow Record if it can be determined from the first packet of the Flow.

                        The CacheLayout class does not have any parameters.

                                If not configured by the user, the field length is set by the Monitoring Device.

                    The Exporting Process may modify the Packet Reports and Flow Records to enable a more efficient transmission or storage under the condition that no information is changed or suppressed. 
                    For example, the Exporting Process may shorten the length of a field according to the rules of reduced size encoding <xref target="RFC5101"/>.
                    The Exporting Process may also export certain fields in a separate Data Record as described in <xref target="RFC5476"/>.

                    In order to use transport layer security, appropriate certificates and keys have to be previously installed on the Monitoring Devices.
                    For security reasons, the configuration data model does not offer the possibility to upload any certificates or keys on a Monitoring Device.
                    If transport layer security is enabled on a Monitoring Device which does not dispose of appropriate certificates and keys, the configuration MUST be rejected with an error.

                    The configuration data model allows restricting the authorization of remote endpoints to certificates issued by specific certification authorities or identifying specific fully qualified domain names for authorization.

                <t>
                    The TransportSession class contains state data about Transport Sessions originating from an Exporting Process or terminating at a Collecting Process.
                    In general, the state parameters correspond to the managed objects in the ipfixTransportSessionTable and ipfixTransportSessionStatsTable of the IPFIX MIB module <xref target="RFC6615"/>.
                    An exception is the usage of the parameters sourceAddress and destinationAddress.
                    If SCTP is transport protocol, Exporter or Collector MAY be multi-homed SCTP endpoints (see <xref target="RFC4960"/>, Section 6.4) and use more than one IP address.
                    In the IPFIX MIB module, ipfixTransportSessionSctpAssocId is used instead of ipfixTransportSessionSourceAddress and ipfixTransportSessionDestinationAddress to point to an entry in the sctpAssocTable defined in the SCTP MIB module <xref target="RFC3871"/>.
                    Since we cannot assume that an SNMP agent offering access to the SCTP MIB module exists on the Monitoring Device, the configuration data model cannot rely on this parameter.
                    Therefore, the state parameters sourceAddress and destinationAddress are used for SCTP as well, containing one of the potentially many Exporter and Collector IP addresses in the SCTP association.
                    Preferably, the IP addresses of the path which is usually selected by the Exporter to send IPFIX Messages to the Collector SHOULD be contained.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Several MIB objects of the ipfixTransportSessionTable are omitted in the TransportSession class.
                    The MIB object ipfixTransportSessionDeviceMode is not included because its value can be derived from the context in which a TransportSession object appears: exporting(1) if it belongs to an Exporting Process, collecting(2) if it belongs to a Collecting Process.
                    Similarly, the MIB object ipfixTransportSessionProtocol is not included as the transport protocol is known from the context as well.
                    The MIB objects ipfixTransportSessionTemplateRefreshTimeout, ipfixTransportSessionOptionsTemplateRefreshTimeout, ipfixTransportSessionTemplateRefreshPacket, and ipfixTransportSessionOptionsTemplateRefreshPacket are not included since they correspond to configuration parameters of the UdpExporter class (templateRefreshTimeout, optionsTemplateRefreshTimeout, templateRefreshPacket, optionsTemplateRefreshPacket) and the UdpCollector class (templateLifeTime, optionsTemplateLifeTime, templateLifePacket, optionsTemplateLifePacket).

                            Used for Exporting Processes, this parameter contains the version number of the IPFIX protocol that the Exporter uses to export its data in this Transport Session.

	<section anchor="sec:adaptation" title="Adaptation to Device Capabilities">
	    <t>
		The configuration data model standardizes a superset of common IPFIX and PSAMP configuration parameters.
		A typical Monitoring Device implementation will not support the entire range of possible configurations.
		Certain functions may not be supported, such as the Collecting Process that does not exist on a Monitoring Device which is conceived as Exporter only.
		The configuration of other functions may be subject to resource limitations or functional restrictions.
		For example, the Cache size is typically limited according to the available memory on the device.
                It is also possible that a Monitoring Device implementation requires the configuration of additional parameters which are not part of the configuration data model in order to function properly.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> offers several possibilities to restrict and adapt a configuration data model.
		The current version of YANG defines the concepts of features, deviations, and extensions.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		The feature concept allows the author of a configuration data model to make proportions of the model conditional in a manner that is controlled by the device.
		Devices do not have to support these conditional parts to conform to the model.
		If the NETCONF protocol is used, features which are supported by the device are announced in the &lt;hello&gt; message <xref target="RFC6241"/>.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		The configuration data model for IPFIX and PSAMP covers the configuration of Exporters, Collectors, and devices that may act as both.
		As Exporters and Collectors implement different functions, the corresponding proportions of the model are conditional on the following features:
            </t>
            <t>
		<list style="hanging">
		    <t hangText="exporter:">
			If this feature is supported, Exporting Processes can be configured.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="collector:">
			If this feature is supported, Collecting Processes can be configured.
		    </t>
		</list> 
            </t>
            <t>
                Exporters do not necessarily implement any Selection Processes, Caches, or even Observation Points in particular cases.
                Therefore, the corresponding proportions of the model are conditional on the following feature:
            </t>
            <t>
		<list style="hanging">
		    <t hangText="meter:">
                        If this feature is supported, Observation Points, Selection Processes, and Caches can be configured.
		    </t>
		</list> 
            </t>
            <t>
		Additional features refer to different PSAMP Sampling and Filtering methods as well as to the supported types of Caches:
            </t>
            <t>
		<list style="hanging">
		    <t hangText="psampSampCountBased:">
			If this feature is supported, Sampling method sampCountBased can be configured.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="psampSampTimeBased:">
			If this feature is supported, Sampling method sampTimeBased can be configured.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="psampSampRandOutOfN:">
			If this feature is supported, Sampling method sampRandOutOfN can be configured.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="psampSampUniProb:">
			If this feature is supported, Sampling method sampUniProb can be configured.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="psampFilterMatch:">
			If this feature is supported, Filtering method filterMatch can be configured.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="psampFilterHash:">
			If this feature is supported, Filtering method filterHash can be configured.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="immediateCache:">
			If this feature is supported, a Cache generating PSAMP Packet Reports can be configured using the ImmediateCache class.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="timeoutCache:">
			If this feature is supported, a Cache generating IPFIX Flow Records can be configured using the TimeoutCache class.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="naturalCache:">
			If this feature is supported, a Cache generating IPFIX Flow Records can be configured using the NaturalCache class.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="permanentCache:">
			If this feature is supported, a Cache generating IPFIX Flow Records can be configured using the PermanentCache class.
		    </t>
		</list> 
            </t>
            <t>
		The following features concern the support of UDP and TCP as transport protocols and the support of File Readers and File Writers:
            </t>
            <t>
		<list style="hanging">
		    <t hangText="udpTransport:">
			If this feature is supported, UDP can be used as transport protocol by Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="tcpTransport:">
			If this feature is supported, TCP can be used as transport protocol by Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="fileReader:">
			If this feature is supported, File Readers can be configured as part of Collecting Processes.
		    </t>
			<vspace blankLines="1" />
		    <t hangText="fileWriter:">
			If this feature is supported, File Writers can be configured as part of Exporting Processes.
		    </t>
		</list> 
	    </t>
	    <t>
		The deviation concept enables a device to announce deviations from the standard model using the "deviation" statement.
                For example, it is possible to restrict the value range of a specific parameter or to define that the configuration of a certain parameter is not supported at all.
		Hence, deviations are typically used to specify limitations due to resource constraints or functional restrictions.
		Deviations concern existing parameters of the original configuration data model and must not be confused with model extensions.
                Model extensions are specified with the "augment" statement and allow adding new parameters to the original configuration data model.
	    </t>
            <t>
                If certain device-specific constraints cannot be formally specified with YANG, they MUST be expressed with human-readable text using the "description" statement.
                The provided information MUST enable the user to define a configuration which is entirely supported by the Monitoring Device.
                On the other hand, if a Monitoring Device is configured, it MUST notify the user about any part of the configuration which is not supported. 
                The Monitoring Device MUST NOT silently accept configuration data which cannot be completely enforced.
		If the NETCONF protocol is used to send configuration data to the Monitoring Device, the error handling is specified in the NETCONF protocol specification <xref target="RFC6241"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
		Just like features, deviations and model extensions are announced in NETCONF's &lt;hello&gt; message.
                A usage example of deviations is given in <xref target="sec:deviation"/>.

		This section shows example configurations conforming to the YANG module specified in <xref target="sec:yang" />.

	    <section anchor="sec:psamp-example" title="PSAMP Device">
		<t>
                    This configuration example configures two Observation Points capturing ingress traffic at eth0 and all traffic at eth1.
                    Both Observed Packet Streams enter two different Selection Processes.
                    The first Selection Process implements a Composite Selectors of a filter for UDP packets and a random sampler. 
		    The second Selection Process implements a Primitive Selector of an ICMP filter.
                    The Selected Packet Streams of both Selection Processes enter the same Cache.
                    The Cache generates a PSAMP Packet Report for every selected packet.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The associated Exporting Process exports to a Collector using PR-SCTP and DTLS.
                    The transport layer security parameters specify that the collector must supply a certificate for the fully qualified domain name collector.example.net. 
                    Valid certificates from any certification authority will be accepted.
                    As the destination transport port is omitted, the standard IPFIX-over-DTLS port 4740 is used.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The parameters of the Selection Processes are reported as Selection Sequence Report Interpretations and Selector Report Interpretations <xref target="RFC5476"/>.
                    There will be two Selection Sequence Report Interpretations per Selection Process, one for each Observation Point. 
		    Selection Sequence Statistics Report Interpretations are exported every 30 seconds (30000 milliseconds).

                    The above configuration results in one Template and six Options Templates.
                    For the remainder of the example, we assume Template ID 256 for the Template and Template IDs 257 to 262 for the Options Templates.
                    The Template is used to export the Packet Reports and has the following fields:

                    After a short runtime, 100 packets have been observed at the two Observation Points, including 20 UDP and 5 ICMP packets.
                    3 of the UDP packets are selected by the random sampler, which results in a total of 8 Packet Reports generated by the Cache.
                    Under these circumstances, the complete configuration and state data of the PSAMP Device may look as follows:

		<t>
                    This configuration example demonstrates the shared usage of a Cache for maintaining Flow Records from two Observation Points belonging to different Observation Domains.
		    Packets are selected using different Sampling techniques: count-based Sampling for the first Observation Point (eth0) and selection of all packets for the second Observation Point (eth1).
                    The Exporting Process sends the Flow Records to a primary destination using SCTP.
                    A UDP Collector is specified as secondary destination. 
                </t>
                <t>
		    Exporting Process reliability statistics <xref target="RFC5101"/> are exported periodically every minute (60000 milliseconds).
		    Selection Sequence Report Interpretations and Selector Report Interpretations <xref target="RFC5476"/> are exported once after configuring the Selection Processes.
                    In total, two Selection Sequence Report Interpretations will be exported, one for each Selection Process.

		<t>
                    This configuration example demonstrates the combined export of Flow Records and Packet Reports for a single Observation Point.
                    One Selection Process applies random Sampling to the Observed Packet Stream.
                    Its output is passed to a Cache generating Flow Records.
                    In parallel, the Observed Packet Stream enters a second Selection Process which discards all non-ICMP packets and passes the selected packets to a second Cache for generating Packet Reports.
                    The output of both Caches is exported to a single Collector using SCTP.

            <t>
                The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/>. 
                The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer and the mandatory to implement secure transport is SSH <xref target="RFC6242"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
                There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module which are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e. config true, which is the default).
                These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  
                Write operations (e.g. edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  
                These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

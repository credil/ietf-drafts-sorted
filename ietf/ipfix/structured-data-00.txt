     Abstract 

        This document specifies an extension to IP Flow Information 
        eXport (IPFIX) protocol specification in [RFC5101] and the IPFIX 
        information model specified in [RFC5102] to support hierarchical 
        structured data and lists (sequences) of Information Elements in 
        data records.  This extension allows definition of complex data 
        structures such as variable-length lists and specification of 
        hierarchical containment relationships between Templates.

      TO DO 
      - Incorporate the WG consensus regarding the Selector ID Length 
      - Does the WG want to include logical OR in this draft? 
      - The template IDs used in appendix B could be modified to make 
      them continue from the earlier examples. However, reviewing the 
      template IDs already used, I saw: 
        8.1 = 258 
        8.2 = 259, 260 
        8.3 = 261, 262, 263, 264 
        8.4 = 270, 271, 272, 273 
          #B = 300, 301. 
        So there's clearly a gap where 265 through 269 weren't used or 
        were removed. Also Template could start at 256. 
       
      
     1. Overview 

     1.1. IPFIX Documents Overview 

      The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators with 
      access to IP Flow information. 
       
      The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow information 
      out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting Process is 
      defined in the IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470], per the requirements 
      defined in RFC 3917 [RFC3917]. 
       
      The IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470] specifies how IPFIX Data Records 
      and Templates are carried via a congestion-aware transport 
      protocol from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX Collecting 
      Processes. 
       
      IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, 
      their name, type and additional semantic information, as specified 
      in the IPFIX information model [RFC5102]. 
       
      In order to gain a level of confidence in the IPFIX 
      implementation, probe the conformity and robustness, and allow 
      interoperability, the Guidelines for IPFIX Testing [RFC5471] 
      presents a list of tests for implementers of compliant Exporting 
      Processes and Collecting Processes. 
      
      The Bidirectional Flow Export [RFC5103] specifies a method for 
      exporting bidirectional flow (biflow) information using the IP 
      Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol, representing each Biflow 
      using a single Flow Record. 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 15, 2010            [Page 7] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Export of Structured Data in IPFIX> October 2009 
         

       
      The "Reducing Redundancy in IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) and 
      Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Reports" [RFC5473] specifies a bandwidth 
      saving method for exporting Flow or packet information, by 
      separating information common to several Flow Records from 
      information specific to an individual Flow Record: common Flow 
      information is exported only once. 
      
      
     1.2. Relationship between IPFIX and PSAMP 

      The specification in this document applies to the IPFIX protocol 
      specifications [RFC5101].  All specifications from [RFC5101] apply 
      unless specified otherwise in this document. 
       
      The Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol [RFC5476] specifies the 
      export of packet information from a PSAMP Exporting Process to a 
      PSAMP Collecting Process.  Like IPFIX, PSAMP has a formal 
      description of its information elements, their name, type and 
      additional semantic information.  The PSAMP information model is 
      defined in [RFC5477]. 
      
      As the PSAMP protocol specifications [RFC5476] are based on the 
      IPFIX protocol specifications, the specifications in this document 
      are also valid for the PSAMP protocol.  
        
      Indeed, the major difference between IPFIX and PSAMP is that the 
      IPFIX protocol exports Flow Records while the PSAMP protocol 
      exports Packet Reports.  From a pure export point of view, IPFIX 
      will not distinguish a Flow Record composed of several packets 
      aggregated together, from a Flow Record composed of a single 
      packet.  So the PSAMP export can be seen as a special IPFIX Flow 
      Record containing information about a single packet. 
      
      
     2. Terminology 

      IPFIX-specific terminology used in this document is defined in 
      section 2 of the IPFIX protocol specification [RFC5101] and 
      section 3 of PSAMP protocol specification [RFC5476].  As in 
      [RFC5101], these IPFIX-specific terms have the first letter of a 
      word capitalized when used in this document. 
       
       
     2.1. New Terminology 

      Structured Data Information Element

          One of the Information Elements supporting structured data, 
          i.e., the basicList, subTemplateList, or subTemplateMultiList 
          Information Elements. 
      
      
     3. Introduction 

      While collecting the interface counters every five minutes has 
      proven to be useful in the past, more and more granular 
      information is required from network elements for a series of 
      applications: performance assurance, capacity planning, security, 
      billing, or simply monitoring.  However, the amount of information 
      has become so important that, when dealing with highly granular 
      information such as Flow information, a push mechanism (as opposed 
      to a pull mechanism, such as SNMP) is the only solution for 
      routers... whose primary function is to route packet.  Indeed, 
      polling short-live Flows via SNMP is not an option: high end 
      routers can support hundreds of thousands of Flows simultaneously.  
      Furthermore, in order to reduce the export bandwidth requirements, 
      the network elements have to integrate mediation functions, to 
      aggregate the collected information, both in space and time. 
       
      Typically, it would be beneficial if access routers could export 
      Flow Records, composed of the counters before and after the WAN 
      optimization mechanism, instead of exporting two Flow Records with 
      identical tuple information. 
       
      In terms of aggregation in time, let us imagine that, for 
      performance assurance, the network management application must 
      receive the performance metrics associated with a specific flow, 
      every millisecond.  Since the performance metrics will be 
      constantly changing, there is a new dimension to the Flow 
      definition: we are not dealing anymore with a single Flow lasting 
      a few seconds or a few minutes, but with a multitude of one 
      millisecond sub flows for which the performance metrics are 
      reported. 
                        
      Which current protocol is suitable for these requirements: push 
      mechanism, highly granular information, and huge number of similar 
      records? IPFIX, as specified in RFC5101 would give part of the 
      solution.

     3.1. The IPFIX Track 

      The IPFIX working group has specified a protocol to export IP Flow 
      information [RFC5101].  This protocol is designed to export 
      information about IP traffic Flows and related measurement data, 
      where a Flow is defined by a set of key attributes (e.g. source 
      and destination IP address, source and destination port, etc.).   
       
      The IPFIX protocol specification [RFC5101] specifies that IP 
      traffic measurements for Flows are exported using a TLV (type, 
      length, value) format.  The information is exported using a 
      Template Record that is sent once to export the {type, length} 
      pairs that define the data format for the Information Elements in 
      a Flow.  The Data Records specify values for each Flow.   
       
      Based on the Requirements for IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) 
      [RFC3917], the IPFIX protocol has been optimized to export Flow 
      related information.  However, thanks to its Template mechanism, 
      the IPFIX protocol can export any type of information, as long as 
      the relevant Information Element is specified in the IPFIX 
      information model [RFC5102], registered with IANA, or specified as 
      an enterprise-specific Information Element.  For each Information 
      Element, the IPFIX information model [RFC5102] defines a numeric 
      identifier, an abstract data type, an encoding mechanism for the 
      data type, and any semantic constraints.  Only basic, single-
      valued data types, e.g., numbers, strings, and network addresses 
      are currently supported. 

      
     3.2. The IPFIX Limitations 

      The IPFIX protocol specification [RFC5101] does not support the 
      encoding of hierarchical structured data and arbitrary-length 
      lists (sequences) of Information Elements as fields within a 
      Template Record.  As it is currently specified, a Data Record is a 
      "flat" list of single-valued attributes.  However, it is a common 
      data modeling requirement to compose complex hierarchies of data 
      types, with multiple occurrences, e.g., 0..* cardinality allowed 
      for instances of each Information Element in the hierarchy.  

      A typical example is the MPLS label stack entries model.  An early 
      NetFlow implementation used two Information Elements to represent 
      the MPLS label stack entry: a "label stack entry position" 
      followed by a "label stack value".  However, several drawbacks 
      were discovered.  Firstly, the Information Elements in the 
      Template Record had to be imposed so that the position would 
      always precede the value.  However, some encoding optimizations 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 15, 2010           [Page 10] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Export of Structured Data in IPFIX> October 2009 
         

      are based on the permutation of Information Element order.  
      Secondly, a new semantic intelligence, not described in the 
      information model, had to be hardcoded in the Collecting Process: 
      the label value at the position "X" in the stack is contained in 
      the "label stack value" Information Element following by a "label 
      stack entry position" Information Element containing the value 
      "X".  Therefore, this model was abandoned. 
       
      The selected solution in the IPFIX information model [RFC5102] is 
      a long series of Information Elements: mplsTopLabelStackSection, 
      mplsLabelStackSection2, mplsLabelStackSection3, 
      mplsLabelStackSection4, mplsLabelStackSection5, 
      mplsLabelStackSection6, mplsLabelStackSection7, 
      mplsLabelStackSection8, mplsLabelStackSection9, 
      mplsLabelStackSection10.  While this model removes any ambiguity, 
      it overloads the IPFIX information model with repetitive 
      information.  Furthermore, if mplsLabelStackSection11 is required, 
      IANA will not be able to assign the new Information Element next 
      to the other ones in the registry, which might cause some 
      confusion. 
       
      Clearly a real structured data type composed of ("label stack 
      entry position", "label stack value") pairs, potentially repeated 
      multiple times in Flow Records would be more efficient from an 
      information model point of view. 
       
      Some more examples enter the same category: how to encode the list 
      of output interfaces in a multicast Flow, how to encode the list 
      of BGP Autonomous Systems (AS) in a BGP Flow, how to encode the 
      BGP communities in a BGP Flow, etc?  
       
      The one-way delay passive measurement, which is described in the 
      IPFIX Applicability [RFC5472], is yet another example that would 
      benefit from a structured data encoding.  Assuming synchronized 
      clocks, the Collector can deduce the one-way delay from the 
      following two Information Elements, collected from two different 
      Observation Points: 
          - Packet arrival time: observationTimeMicroseconds [RFC5477] 
          - Packet ID: digestHashValue [RFC5477] 
      Ideally, the measurement at the second Observation Point should 
      start a little bit later than at the first Observation Point, 
      allowing the packets to arrive at the destination.  In practice, 
      this implies that many pairs of (observationTimeMicroseconds, 
      digestHashValue) must be exported for each Observation Point, even 
      if some optimization based on Hash-Based Filtering [RFC5475] is 
      used.  Instead of exporting repetitive information as part of 
      every single Flow Record (for example, the 5 tuple), an optimized 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 15, 2010           [Page 11]

      flow record composed of a structured data type such as the 
      following would save a lot of bandwidth: 
          5 tuple 
                    observationTimeMicroseconds 1, digestHashValue 1 
                    observationTimeMicroseconds 2, digestHashValue 2 
                    observationTimeMicroseconds 3, digestHashValue 3 
                    ...  , ... 
         
      As a last example, here is a more complex case of hierarchical 
      structured data encoding.  Consider the example scenario of an IPS 
      (Intrusion Prevention System) alert data structure containing 
      multiple participants, where each participant contains multiple 
      attackers and multiple targets, with each target potentially 
      composed of multiple applications, as depicted below: 
       
          alert 
              signatureId 
              protocolIdentifier 
              riskRating 
              participant 1 
                  attacker 1 
                      sourceIPv4Address 
                      applicationId 
                  ... 
                  attacker N 
                      sourceIPv4Address 
                      applicationId 
                  target 1 
                      destinationIPv4Address 
                      applicationId 1 
                      ... 
                      applicationId n 
                  ... 
                  target N 
                      destinationIPv4Address 
                      applicationId 1 
                      ... 
                      applicationId n 
              participant 2 
                  ... 
       
      To export this information in IPFIX, the data would need to be 
      flattened (thus losing the hierarchical relationships) and a new

      IPFIX Template created for each alert, according to the number of 
      applicationID elements in each target, the number of targets and 
      attackers in each participant and the number of participants in 
      each alert.  Clearly each Template will be unique to each alert, 
      and a large amount of CPU, memory and export bandwidth will be 
      wasted creating, exporting, maintaining, and withdrawing the 
      Templates.  See Appendix C8. for a specific example related to 
      this case study. 
      
      
     3.3. The Proposal 

      This document specifies an IPFIX extension to support hierarchical 
      structured data and variable-length lists by defining three new 
      Information Elements and three corresponding new abstract data 
      types called basicList, subTemplateList, and subTemplateMultiList. 
      These are defined in section 4.1. New Abstract Data Types. 
       
      It is important to note that whereas the Information Elements and 
      abstract data types defined in the IPFIX information model 
      [RFC5102] represent single values, these new abstract data types 
      are structural in nature and primarily contain references to other 
      Information Elements and to Templates.  By referencing other 
      Information Elements and Templates from an Information Element's 
      data content, it is possible to define complex data structures 
      such as variable-length lists and to specify hierarchical 
      containment relationships between Templates.  Therefore, this 
      document prefers the more generic "Data Record" term to the "Flow 
      Record" term. 
      
      
     4. Linkage with the Information Model 

      As in the IPFIX Protocol specification [RFC5101], the new 
      Information Elements specified in section 4.3. below MUST be sent 
      in canonical format in network-byte order (also known as the big-
      endian byte ordering). 
       
       
     4.1. New Abstract Data Types 

      This document specifies three new abstract data types, as 
      described below.

     4.1.1. basicList 

      The type "basicList" represents a list of zero or more instances 
      of any single Information Element, primarily used for single-
      valued data types. For example, a list of port numbers, a list of 
      interface indexes, a list of AS in a BGP AS-PATH, etc.  
       
       
     4.1.2. subTemplateList 

      The type "subTemplateList" represents a list of zero or more 
      instances of a structured data type, where the data type of each 
      list element is the same and corresponds with a single Template 
      Record. For example, a structured data type composed of multiple 
      pairs of ("MPLS label stack entry position", "MPLS label stack 
      value"), a structured data type composed of performance metrics, a 
      structured data type composed of multiple pairs of IP address, 
      etc. 
       
       
     4.1.3. subTemplateMultiList 

      The type "subTemplateMultiList" represents a list of zero or more 
      instances of a structured data type, where the data type of each 
      list element can be different and corresponds with different 
      template definitions. For example, a structured data type composed 
      of multiple access-list entries, where entries can be composed of 
      different criteria types. 
       
       
     4.2. New Data Type Semantic 

      This document specifies a new data type semantic, as described 
      below.  
       
       
     4.2.1. List 

      A list represents an arbitrary-length sequence of structured data 
      elements, either composed of regular Information Elements or 
      composed of data conforming to a Template Record. 
       
       
     4.3. New Information Elements 

      This document specifies three new Information Elements, as 
      described below.

     4.3.1. basicList 

      A basicList specifies a generic Information Element with a 
      basicList abstract data type as defined in section 4.1.1. and list 
      semantics as defined in section 4.2.1.  For example, a list of 
      port numbers, list of interface indexes, etc.   
       
      EDITOR'S NOTE: while waiting for IANA to assign this new 
      Information Element identifier, the value XXX is used in all the 
      examples. 
       
       
     4.3.2. subTemplateList 

      A subTemplateList specifies a generic Information Element with a 
      subTemplateList abstract data type as defined in section 4.1.2. 
      and list semantics as defined in section 4.2.1.  
       
      EDITOR'S NOTE: while waiting for IANA to assign this new 
      Information Element identifier, the value YYY is used in all the 
      examples.   
       
       
     4.3.3. subTemplateMultiList 

      A subTemplateMultiList specifies a generic Information Element 
      with a subTemplateMultiList abstract data type as defined in 
      section 4.1.3. and list semantics as defined in section 4.2.1.  
       
      EDITOR'S NOTE: while waiting for IANA to assign this new 
      Information Element identifier, the value ZZZ is used in all the 
      examples. 
       
       
     4.4. Encoding of IPFIX Data Types 

      The following sections define the encoding of the data types 
      defined in section 4.1. above. 
       
      When the encoding of a Structured Data Information Element has a 
      fixed length (because, for example, it contains the same number of 
      fixed-length elements, or if the permutations of elements in the 
      list always produces the same total length), the element length 
      can be encoded in the corresponding Template Record.  However, 
      when representing variable-length data, hierarchical data, and

      repeated data with variable element counts, we RECOMMEND these are 
      encoded as a Variable-Length Information Element as described in 
      section 7 of [RFC5101], with the length carried in one or three 
      octets before the Structured Data Information Element encoding. 
       
       
     4.4.1. basicList 

      The basicList Information Element defined in section 4.3.1.  
      represents a list of zero or more instances of an Information 
      Element and is encoded as follows: 
       
       0                   1                   2                   3

      Field ID 
       
          The Field ID is the Information Element identifier of the 
          Information Element(s) contained in the list. 
           
      Element Length 
       
          The Element Length indicates the length of each element or 
          contains the value 0xFFFF if the length is encoded as for a 
          variable-length Information Element. 
       
      BasicList Content 
       
          A Collection Process decodes list elements from the BasicList 
          Content until no further data remains.  A field count is not 
          included but can be derived when the Information Element is 
          decoded. 
           
      Note that in the diagram above, the Field ID is shown with the 
      Enterprise bit (most significant bit) set to 0.  If instead the 
      Enterprise bit is set to 1, a four-byte Enterprise Number MUST be 
      encoded immediately after the Element Length as shown below.  See

      Also note that, if a basicList has zero elements, the encoded data 
      contains the Field ID, the Element Length and the four-byte 
      Enterprise Number (if present); the BasicList Content is empty. 

      The Element Length field is effectively part of a header, so even 
      in the case of a zero-element list with no Enterprise Number, it 
      MUST NOT be omitted. 

      If the basicList is encoded as a Variable-Length Information 
      Element in less than 255 octets, it is encoded with the Length per

      The subTemplateList Information Element represents a list of zero

      referenced by a subTemplateList Information Element can itself 
      contain other subTemplateList Information Elements, and because 
      these Template Record references are part of the Information 
      Elements content in the Data Record, it is possible to represent 
      complex hierarchical data structures.  The following diagram shows 
      how a subTemplateList Information Element is encoded within a Data 
      Record:

      Template ID 
       
          The Template ID is the ID of the template used to encode and 
          decode the SubTemplateList Content. 
       
      SubTemplateList Content 
       
          The SubTemplateList Content consists of zero or more instances 
          of Data Records corresponding to the Template ID.  A 
          Collecting Process decodes the Data Records until no further 
          data remains.  A record count is not included but can be 
          derived when the subTemplateList is decoded.  Encoding and 
          decoding are performed recursively if the specified Template

          described here. 
       
      Note that, if a subTemplateList has zero elements, the encoded 
      data contains just the Template ID; the SubTemplateList Content is 
      empty. 
       
      If the subTemplateList is encoded as a Variable-Length Information 
      Element in less than 255 octets, it is encoded with the Length per 
      section 7 of [RFC5101] as follows: 
       
       0                   1                   2                   3

      Whereas each top-level element in a subTemplateList Information 
      Element corresponds with a single Template ID and therefore has 
      the same data type, sometimes it is useful for a list to contain 
      elements of more than one data type.  To support this case, each 
      top-level element in a subTemplateMultiList Information Element 
      carries a Template ID and Length.  The following diagram shows how

      Element Template ID 
       
          Unlike the subTemplateList Information Element, each list 
          element contains an Element Length and Element Template ID 
          which specifies the encoding of the following Element Content. 
       
      Element Content 
       
          The Element Content consists of zero or more instances of Data 
          Records corresponding to the Element Template ID.  A 
          Collecting Process decodes the Data Records until no further 
          data remains.  A record count is not included but can be 
          derived when the Element Content is decoded.  Encoding and 
          decoding are performed recursively if the specified Template

      In the exceptional case of zero instances in the 
      subTemplateMultiList, no data is encoded and the Length is set to 
      zero. 
       
      If the subTemplateMultiList is encoded as a Variable-Length 
      Information Element in less than 255 octets, it is encoded with 
      the Length per section 7 of [RFC5101] as follows:

     5. Structured Data Format 

       
     5.1. Length Encoding Considerations 

      The new Structured Data Information Elements represent a list that 
      potentially carries complex hierarchical and repeated data.  In 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 15, 2010           [Page 21] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Export of Structured Data in IPFIX> October 2009 
         

      the normal case where the number and length of elements can vary 
      from record to record, these Information Elements are encoded as 
      variable-length Information Elements as described in section 7 of 
      [RFC5101]. 
       
      Because of the complex and repeated nature of the data, it is 
      potentially difficult for the Exporting Process to efficiently 
      know in advance the exact encoding size; as a result, data may be 
      recursively encoded starting at a fixed offset, with the final 
      length only known and filled in afterwards. 
       
      Therefore, the three-byte length encoding is RECOMMENDED for 
      variable-length information elements in all Template Records 
      containing a Structured Data Information Element, even if the 
      encoded length can be less than 255 bytes, because the starting 
      offset of the data is known in advance. 
       
      An Exporting Process MUST take care when encoding such data to not 
      exceed the maximum allowed length of an IPFIX Message, 65535 
      bytes, respecting the IPFIX specifications [RFC5101] that imposes: 
      "The IPFIX Message Header 16-bit Length field limits the length of 
      an IPFIX Message to 65535 octets, including the header".  
       
       
     5.2. Recursive Structured Data 

      It is possible to define recursive relationships between IPFIX 
      structured data instances, for example when representing a tree 
      structure.  The simplest case of this might be a basicList where 
      each element is itself a basicList, or a subTemplateList where one 
      of the fields of the referenced template is itself a 
      subTemplateList referencing the same Template.  When encoding 
      recursively-defined structured data, each leaf element of the 
      encoded structure MUST be terminated with a zero-length element.  
      This implies that variable-length encoding as described in section 
      7 of [RFC5101] MUST be used when such a recursive relationship 
      exists. Also, the Exporting Process MUST take care that, when 
      encoding recursively-defined structured data, to not exceed the 
      maximum allowed length of an IPFIX Message (as noted in Length 
      Encoding Considerations). 
       
       
     5.3. Structured Data Information Elements Applicability in Options 
        Template Sets 

      Structured Data Information Elements MAY be used in Options 
      Template Sets. 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 15, 2010           [Page 22] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Export of Structured Data in IPFIX> October 2009 
         

       
      As an example, consider a mediation function that must aggregate 
      Data Records from multiple Observation Point types:  
       
         Router 1, (interface 1)  
         Router 2, (line card A)  
         Router 3, (line card B)  
         Router 4, (line card C, interface 2)  
       
      In order to encode the PSAMP Selection Sequence Report 
      Interpretation [RFC5476], the mediation function must express this 
      combination of Observation Points as a single new Observation 
      Point.  Recall from [RFC5476] that the PSAMP Selection Sequence 
      Report Interpretation consists of the following fields:  
       
         Scope:     selectionSequenceId  
         Non-Scope: one Information Element mapping the Observation  
                    Point  
                    selectorId (one or more)  
       
      Without structured data, there is clearly no way to express the 
      complex aggregated Observation Point as "one Information Element 
      mapping the Observation Point".  However, the desired result may 
      be easily achieved using the structured data types.  Refer to 
      Section 8.4. "Encoding an Options Template Set using Structured 
      Data" for an encoding example related to this case study. 
       
      Regarding the scope in the Options Template Record, the IPFIX 
      specification [RFC5101] mentions that "The IPFIX protocol doesn't 
      prevent the use of any Information Elements for scope".  
      Therefore, a Structured Data Information Element MAY be used as 
      scope in an Options Template Set.   
       
      Extending the previous example, the mediation function could 
      export a given name for this complex aggregated Observation Point:  
       
         Scope: Aggregated Observation Point (Structured Data)  
         Non-Scope: a new Information Element containing the name   
       
       
     5.4. Usage Guidelines for Equivalent Data Representations 

      Because basicList, subTemplateList, and subTemplateMultiList are 
      all lists, in several cases there is more than one way to 
      represent what is effectively the same data structure.  However, 
      in some cases, one approach has an advantage over the other e.g. 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 15, 2010           [Page 23] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Export of Structured Data in IPFIX> October 2009 
         

      more compact, uses fewer resources, etc., and is therefore 
      preferred over an alternate representation. 

      A subTemplateList can represent the same simple list of single-
      value Information Elements as a basicList, if the Template 
      referenced by the subTemplateList contains only one single-valued 
      Information Element.  Although the encoding is more compact than a 
      basicList by two bytes, using a subTemplateList in this case 
      requires a new Template per list element.  The basicList requires 
      no additional Template and is therefore RECOMMENDED in this case.  

      Although a subTemplateMultiList with one Element can represent the 
      contents of a subTemplateList, the subTemplateMultiList carries 
      two additional bytes (Element  Length).  It is also potentially 
      useful to a Collecting Process to know in advance that a 
      subTemplateList directly indicates that list element types are 
      consistent.  The subTemplateList Information Element is therefore 
      RECOMMENDED in this case. 
       
      Similarly, although a basicList of single-element subTemplateList 
      Information Elements can represent the same mixed-type content as 
      a subTemplateMultiList, a basicList instance carries four 
      additional bytes (Element Length and Field ID), so the 
      subTemplateMultiList is more compact and is therefore RECOMMENDED 
      in this case.  The basicList is best suited for exporting 
      recurrence of a single Information Element.  

      Note that the referenced Information Element(s) in the Structured 
      Data Information Elements can be taken from the IPFIX information 
      model [RFC5102], the PSAMP information model [RFC5477], or any of 
      the Information Elements defined in the IANA IPFIX registry. 
       
       
     5.5. Padding 

      The Exporting Process MAY insert some padding octets in structured 
      data field values in a Data Record by including the 
      'paddingOctets' Information Element as described in [RFC5101] 
      section 3.3.1, "Set Format".  The paddingOctets Information 
      Element can be included in a Template Record referenced by 
      Structured Data Information Element for this purpose.

     6. Template Management  

      This section introduces some more specific Template Management and 
      Template Withdrawal Message-related specifications compared to the 
      IPFIX protocol specification [RFC5101]. 
       
      First of all, the Template ID uniqueness is unchanged compared to 
      [RFC5101]; the uniqueness is local to the Transport Session and 
      Observation Domain that generated the Template ID.  In other 
      words, the Set ID used to export the Template Record does not 
      influence the Template ID uniqueness. 
      
      While [RFC5101] mentions that: "If an Information Element is 
      required more than once in a Template, the different occurrences 
      of this Information Element SHOULD follow the logical order of 
      their treatments by the Metering Process.", this rule MAY not be 
      followed for the Structured Data Information Elements.   
      
      As specified in [RFC5101], Templates that are not used anymore 
      SHOULD be deleted.  Before reusing a Template ID, the Template 
      MUST be deleted.  In order to delete an allocated Template, the 
      Template is withdrawn through the use of a Template Withdrawal 
      Message.  
      
      
     7. The Collecting Process's Side  

      This section introduces some more specific specifications to the 
      Collection Process compared to section 9 in the IPFIX Protocol 
      [RFC5101].   
      
      As described in [RFC5101], a Collecting Process MUST note the 
      Information Element identifier of any Information Element that it 
      does not understand and MAY discard that Information Element from 
      the Flow Record.  Therefore a Collection Process that does not 
      support the extension specified in this document can ignore the 
      Structured Data Information Elements in a Data Record, or it can 
      ignore Data Records containing these new Structured Data

     8.2. Encoding subTemplateList 

      As explained in section 3.2. , multiple pairs of 
      (observationTimeMicroseconds, digestHashValue) must be collected 
      from two different Observation Points to compute passively the 
      one-way delay across the network.  This data can be exported with 
      an optimized Flow Record that consists of the following 
      attributes:  
       
          5 tuple 
                    observationTimeMicroseconds 1, digestHashValue 1 
                    observationTimeMicroseconds 2, digestHashValue 2 
                    observationTimeMicroseconds 3, digestHashValue 3 
                    ...  , ... 
      

      A subTemplateList is best suited for exporting the list of   
      (observationTimeMicroseconds, digestHashValue).  For illustration 
      purposes, the number of elements in the list is 5, in practice, it 
      could be more.

     8.3. Encoding subTemplateMultiList  

     As explained in section 4.4.3. , a subTemplateMultiList is used to 
     export a list of mixed-type content where each top level element 
     corresponds to a different Template Record.   

     To illustrate this, consider the Flow Record with the following 
     attributes: 

       
          5 tuple (Flow Keys), octetCount, packetCount 
                    attributes for classification 
                         selectorId,  
                         selectorAlgorithm 
                    attributes for sampling 
                         selectorId,  
                         selectorAlgorithm,  
                         samplingPacketInterval,  
                         samplingPacketSpace 
         
     This example demonstrates that the Selector Report Interpretation 
     [RFC5476] can be encoded with the subTemplateMultiList. More 
     specifically, the example describes Property Match Filtering 
     Selector Report Interpretation [RFC5476] used for classification 
     purposes, and the Systemic Count-Based Sampling as described in 
     Section 6.5.2.1 of [RFC5476]. Some traffic will be filtered 
     according to match properties configured, some will be sampled, 
     some will be filtered and sampled, and some will not be filtered or 
     be sampled. 
      
     A subTemplateMultiList is best suited for exporting this variable 
     data.  A Template is defined for classification attributes and 
     another Template is defined for sampling attributes.  A Flow Record 
     can contain data corresponding to either of the Templates, both or 
     none.

     Sampling attributes: 

     For Systemic Count-Based Sampling as defined in Section 6.5.2.1 of 
     [RFC5476] the required algorithm-specific Information Elements are: 

           samplingPacketInterval: number of packets selected in a row 
           samplingPacketSpace:    number of packets between selections 
      
        Example of a simple 1 out-of 100 systematic count-based Selector 
        definition, where the samplingPacketInterval is 1 and the 
        samplingPacketSpace is 99.

     8.4. Encoding an Options Template Set using Structured Data 

      As described in section 5.3. , consider a mediation function that 
      must aggregate Data Records from multiple different Observation 
      Points. 
       
      Say Observation Point 1 consists of one or more interfaces, 
      Observation Points 2 and 3 consist of one or more line cards, and 
      Observation Point 4 consists of one or more interfaces and one or 
      more line cards.  Without the support for structured data, a 
      template would have to be defined for every possible combination 
      to interpret the data corresponding to each of the Observation 
      Points.  However, with the support for structured data, a 
      basicList can be used to encode the list of interfaces and another 
      basicList can be used to encode the list of line cards.  
       
      For the sake of simplicity, each Observation Point shown below has 
      an <interface> or <linecard> or <line card and interface>. This 
      can very well be extended to include a list of interfaces and a 
      list of linecards using basicLists as explained above. 
       
         Observation Point 1: Router 1, (interface 1)  
         Observation Point 2: Router 2, (line card A)   
         Observation Point 3: Router 3, (line card B)   
         Observation Point 4: Router 4, (line card C, interface 2)  
       
       
      The mediation function wishes to express this as a single 
      Observation Point, in order to encode the PSAMP Selection Sequence 
      Report Interpretation (SSRI).  Recall from [RFC5476] that the 
      PSAMP Selection Sequence Report Interpretation consists of the 
      following fields:  
       
         Scope:     selectionSequenceId  
         Non-Scope: one Information Element mapping the Observation  
                    Point  
                    selectorId (one or more)  
       
      For example, the Observation Point detailed above may be encoded 
      in a PSAMP Selection Sequence Report Interpretation as shown 
      below:  
       
       Selection Sequence 7 (Filter->Sampling):  
         observation point: subTemplateMultiList.  
                              Router 1, (interface 1)  
                              Router 2, (line card A)

     9. Relationship with the Other IFPIX Documents 

     9.1. Relationship with Reducing Redundancy  

        "Reducing Redundancy in IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) and 
        Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Reports" [RFC5473] describes a bandwidth 
        saving method for exporting Flow or packet information using the 
        IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) protocol. 

        It defines the commonPropertiesID Information Element for 
        exporting Common Properties. 

      

     9.1.1. Encoding Structured Data Element using Common Properties. 

        When Structured Data Information Elements contain repeated 
        elements, these elements may be replaced with a 
        commonPropertiesID Information Element as specified in 
        [RFC5473].  The replaced elements may include the basicList, 
        subTemplateList and subTemplateMultiList Information Elements. 

        This technique might help reducing the bandwidth requirements 
        for the export.  However, a detailed analysis of the gain has 
        not been done; refer to Section 8.3 "Efficiency Gain" [RFC5473] 
        for further considerations. 

         

     9.1.2. Encoding Common Properties elements With Structured Data 
        Element. 

        Structured Data Information Element MAY be used to define a list 
        of commonPropertiesID, as a replacement for the specifications 
        in [RFC5473]. 

        Indeed, the example in figures 1 and 2 of [RFC5473] can be 
        encoded with the specifications in this document.

        The example in figure ZB could be encoded with a basicList if 
        the <Flow information> represents a single Information Element, 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 15, 2010           [Page 40]

        with a subTemplateList if the <Flow information> represents a 
        Template Record, or with a subTemplateMultiList if the <Flow 
        information> is composed of different Template Records.  

        Using Structured Data Information Elements as a replacement for 
        the techniques specified in "Reducing Redundancy in IP Flow 
        Information Export (IPFIX) and Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Reports" 
        [RFC5473] offers the advantage that a single Template Record is 
        defined.  Hence the Collectors job in term of Template 
        management and combining Template/Options Template Records is 
        simplified.  

        However, it must be noted that using Structured Data Information 
        Elements as a replacement for the techniques specified in 
        "Reducing Redundancy in IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) and 
        Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Reports" only applies to simplified 
        cases. For example, the "Multiple Data Reduction" (section 7.1 
        [RFC5473]) might be too complex to encode with Structured Data 
        Information Elements.  

      

     9.2. Relationship with Guidelines for IPFIX Testing 

        [RFC5471] presents a list of tests for implementers of IP Flow 
        Information eXport (IPFIX) compliant Exporting Processes and 
        Collecting Processes.  

        Although [RFC5471] doesn't define any structured data element 
        specific tests, the Structured Data Information Elements can be 
        used in many of the [RFC5471] tests. 

        The [RFC5471] series of test could be useful because the 
        document specifies that every Information Element type should be 
        tested.  However, not all cases from this document are tested in 
        [RFC5471]. 

        The following sections are especially noteworthy: 

          . 3.2.1.  Transmission of Template with fixed size 
             Information Elements 

               - each data type should be used in at least one test. 
                  The new data types specified in section 4.1. should 
                  be included in this test.

     Internet-Draft <Export of Structured Data in IPFIX> October 2009 
         

          .  3.2.2. Transmission of Template with variable length 
             Information Elements 

               - this test should be expanded to include Data Records 
                  containing variable length basicList, 
                  subTemplateList, and subTemplateMultiList Information 
                  Elements. 

          . 3.3.1. Enterprise-specific Information Elements 

               - this test should include the export of basicList, 
                  subTemplateList, and subTemplateMultiList Information 
                  Elements containing Enterprise-specific Information 
                  Elements. e.g., see the example in figure B. 

          . 3.3.3. Multiple instances of the same Information Element 
             in one Template 

               - this test should verify that multiple instances of the 
                  basicList, subTemplateList and subTemplateMultiList 
                  Information Elements are accepted. 

          . 3.5 Stress/Load tests 

               - since the structured data types defined here allow 
                  modeling of complex data structures, they may be 
                  useful for stress testing both Exporting Processes 
                  and Collecting Processes. 

                

     9.3. Relationship with Bidirectional Flow Export  

        [RFC5103] describes a method for exporting bidirectional flow 
        information, and defines the biflowDirection Information Element 
        for this purpose. 
         
        [RFC5103] Biflows may be encoded in a subTemplateList or 
        subTemplateMultiList. The basicList requires recurrence of a 
        single element, so is not suitable for Biflows. 
         
        Encoding Biflows with subTemplateList or subTemplateMultiList 
        provides a more logical division of the information in both 
        directions, although this encoding incurs a small additional 
        bandwidth penalty.

        An example of Biflow encoding using Structure Data Information 
        Elements and comparison with the [RFC5103] Biflow encoding is 
        shown in Appendix B. 
         
         
     9.4. Relationship with IPFIX Mediation Function 

        The Structured Data Information Elements would be beneficial for 
        the export of aggregated Data Records in mediation function, as 
        it was demonstrated with the example of the aggregated 
        Observation Point in section 5.3.  

         

     10. IANA Considerations 

      This document specifies several new IPFIX abstract data types, a 
      new IPFIX Data Type Semantic, and several new Information 
      Elements. 
       
      These require the creation of two new IPFIX registries and 
      updating the existing IPFIX Information Element registry as 
      detailed below. 
       
       
     10.1. New Abstract Data Types 

      Section 4.1. of this document specifies several new IPFIX abstract 
      data types. Per section 6 of the IPFIX information model 
      [RFC5102], new abstract data types can be added to the IPFIX 
      information model.  This requires creation of a new IPFIX 
      "abstract data types" registry at 
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix. This registry should 
      include all the abstract data types from section 3.1 of [RFC5102].  
       
      Abstract data types to be added to the IPFIX "abstract data types" 
      registry are listed below.  
       
       
     10.1.1. basicList 

      The type "basicList" represents a list of any Information Element 
      used for single-valued data types.

     Internet-Draft <Export of Structured Data in IPFIX> October 2009 
         

     10.1.2. subTemplateList 

      The type "subTemplateList" represents a list of a structured data 
      type, where the data type of each list element is the same and 
      corresponds with a single Template Record.  
       
       
     10.1.3. subTemplateMultiList 

      The type "subTemplateMultiList" represents a list of structured 
      data types, where the data types of the list elements can be 
      different and correspond with different template definitions. 
      
      
     10.2. New Data Type Semantics 

      Section 4.2. of this document specifies a new IPFIX Data Type 
      Semantic. Per section 3.2 of the IPFIX information model 
      [RFC5102], new data type semantics can be added to the IPFIX 
      information model. This requires creation of a new IPFIX "data 
      types semantics" registry at 
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix. This registry should 
      include all the data type semantics from section 3.2 of [RFC5102]. 
       
      Data type semantics to be added to the IPFIX "data types 
      semantics" registry are listed below. 
          
     10.2.1. list 

      A list is a structured data type, being composed of a sequence of 
      elements e.g. Information Element, Template Record, etc.  
       
       
     10.3. New Information Elements 

      Section 4.3. of this document specifies several new Information 
      Elements which are to be created in the IPFIX Information Element 
      registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix.  
       
      New Information Elements to be added to the IPFIX Information 
      Element registry are listed below.

      Appendix B.  Example of Biflow Encoding using Structured Data 
      Information Elements 

        Referring to [RFC5103] figure 1, a Biflow consists of two parts: 
        some "key" fields such as src/dst information (IP addresses, 
        ports), followed by a set of forward/reverse pairs.  
         
        Then looking at [RFC5103] figure 7, we see that the Reverse PEN 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 15, 2010           [Page 50] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Export of Structured Data in IPFIX> October 2009 
         

        is repeated many times to indicate fields which were observed in 
        the reverse direction. Clearly that repetition is wasteful.  
         
        Looking back at [RFC5103] figure 1, it's clear that the encoding 
        can use a Template Record consisting of the Flow Keys followed 
        by a subTemplateList consisting of two elements: one for the 
        forward direction, the other for the reverse direction. 
         
        The subTemplateList uses a single Template Record to describe 
        the fields in both lists since they are a set of forward/reverse 
        pairs.

      Note that the Data Set length is 45, compared with 41 in RFC5103. 
      The four additional octets are due to the inclusion of the 16-bit 
      Template ID and two, 8-bit direction indicators. 
       
      Clearly structured data offers an alternative way to encode 
      Biflows.  Although this may not be best suited if the number of 
      elements is small as in this example, it does offer a more robust 
      and scalable solution if multiple elements need to be encoded. 
       
       
      Appendix C.  Encoding IPS Alert using Structured Data Information 
      Elements 

      In this section, a contrived example of an IPS alert is used to 
      demonstrate how complex data and multiple levels of hierarchy can 
      be encoded using Structured Data Information Elements.   
       
      An IPS alert consists of the following mandatory attributes:  
      signatureId, protocolIdentifier and riskRating.  It can also 
      contain zero or more participants, each participant can contain 
      zero or more attackers and zero or more targets.  An attacker 
      contains the attributes sourceIPv4Address and applicationId and 
      a target contains the attribute destinationIPv4Address and zero or 
      more occurrences of the attribute applicationId. 
       
      Note that the signatureId and riskRating Information Element 
      fields are created for these examples only; the Field IDs are 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 15, 2010           [Page 53] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Export of Structured Data in IPFIX> October 2009 
         

      shown as N/A.  The signatureId helps to uniquely identify the IPS 
      signature that triggered the alert.  The riskRating identifies the 
      potential risk, on a scale of 0-100 (100 being most serious), of 
      the traffic that triggered the alert. 
       
      Consider the following contrived example of an IPS alert.  The 
      participant can contain attackers and targets in any order and the 
      sequence conveys some information to the Collector and needs to be 
      preserved.  In the example below, we have attacker1 A1, target T1 
      and attacker A2 and this is encoded as a subTemplateMultiList.   
       
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

                               192.0.2.4  104    
      ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
       
      Where attacker A1 is: (IP, appID)=(192.0.2.3, 103) 
      Where attacker A2 is: (IP, appID)=(192.0.2.4, 104) 
      Where target T1 is: (IP, appID)= (192.0.2.103, (3001, 3002)) 
       
      To represent an alert, the following Templates are defined: 
      Template for target (270) 
      Template for attacker (271) 
      Template for participant (272) 
      Template for alert (273)

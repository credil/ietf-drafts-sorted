Abstract

   Flow selection is the process of selecting a subset of flows from all
   flows observed at an observation point.  The objective of flow
   selection is to reduce the effor for post-processing flow data and
   for transfering flow records.  The flow selection process can be
   enabled at different stages of the measurement process.  It can be
   applied directly after classification or at recording/exporting time
   by limiting the number of flows to be stored and/or exported to the
   collecting process.  This document describes motivations for flow
   selection and presents flow selection techniques.  It furthermore
   provides an information model for configuring flow selection
   techniques and discusses what information about a flow selection
   process is beneficial to be exported by adopting a suitable
   information model.

Internet-Draft          Flow Selection Techniques             March 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document describes flow selection techniques for traffic
   measurements.  [RFC5475], describes packet selection techniques,
   which describe sampling and filtering techniques for selecting a
   subset of packets The element on which this selection mechanism is
   performed is a packet and the selection decision is based on packet
   propeorties in contrats to this, flow selection techniques consider
   flows as the basic elements on which a selection process is performed
   In the IPFIX architecture the basis element on which the selection
   process is performed are the IPFIX flow records.  For several
   applications it makes sense to select only the flows of interest if
   resources are scarce.  Examples are accounting or attack detection
   applications.  One example are attack detection techniques.  If an
   attack is ongoing in the network, resources are quite scarce.
   Maintainign and exporting all flow records to the collecting process
   would increse resource demands even further with the result that data
   is randomly discarded.  A better solution is to export only a
   representative subset of flows.  For some botnet attacks many similar
   flows occur from different source addresses.  So it can be useful to
   include some meta-data ,to indicate that there are multiple flows
   active with similar characteristics.  Another example are accounting
   applications.  In many networks few large flows contribute to the
   majority of the overall traffic volume [DuLT01a], [DuLT01b].  This
   phenomenon is also referred to as "Quasi-Zipf-Law" [KuXW04] or as
   "elephant and mice phenomenon".  For accounting puposes it may be
   useful to concentrate on the large so-called "heavy hitter" flows to
   cope with a limited flow cache size or limited transmission capacity
   in times when resources are scarce.


2.  Scope

   This document describes flow selection techniques and its parameters.
   It addresses the configuration of flow selection techniques and
   defines which information should be reported by devices that perform
   flow selection.  It only describes processes directly acting on
   traffic flows during the metering phase and/or the exporting phase.
   Therefore it is assumed that flow selection is performed after
   packets are classified into flows.  This document does not address
   the flow selection effects that might result from the sampling or
   filtering of packets in the metering process before the
   classification process is performed.  Such packet selection
   techniques are described in [RFC5475] and, therefore, outside the
   scope of this document.

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology introduced in [RFC5470] and
   [RFC5475] In this section, some additional terms are presented which
   extend the terminology introduced in [RFC5475].

   * Flow Selection Process

      A Flow Selection Process takes a set of Flow Records as its input
      and selects a subset of that set as its output.

   * Flow Selection State

      A Flow Selection Process may maintain state information for use by
      the Flow Selection Process.  At a given time, the Flow Selection
      State may depend on flows observed at and before that time, and
      other variables.  Examples include:

        (i)   number of accounted flow records;

        (ii)  memory space available for flow recording;

        (iii) state of the pseudorandom number generators;

        (iv)  hash values calculated during selection.

   * Flow Selector

      A Flow Selector defines the action of a Flow Selection Process on
      a single flow of its input.  The Flow Selector can make use of the
      following information in determining whether a flow is selected:

        (i)   the content of the flow record;

        (ii)  any information state related to the flow recording;

        (iii) any selection state that may be maintained by the Flow
              Selection Process.


4.  Position of the Flow Selection Process

   Figure 1 shows the IPFIX reference model as defined in [RFC5470], and
   extends it by introducing the functional components where flow
   selection can take place.

   In contrast to packet selection, flow selection is always applied
   after the packets are classified into flows.  Flows can be selected
   at different stages of the measurement chain:

   1.  during metering [RFC5475]

   2.  during flow recording

   3.  during flow export


5.  Flow selection techniques

   We can distinguish the following selection techniques:

   1.  based on flow record content (i.e. flow characteristics that are
       described in the flow report);

   2.  based on flow record arrival time;

   3.  based on external events like the exhaustion of local resources.

5.1.  Flow selection based on flow record content

   Flow selection can be done based on fields in an IPFIX flow record.
   This can be done analogous to field match filtering for packet
   selection described in [RFC5475].  The difference here is that
   instead of packets here field of the flow record content are used for
   the selection decision.  An example would be to select flow records
   with regard to the flow size in bytes or number of packets.  Another
   application would be to select flow records based on flow start time
   or on flow keys (IP addresses, ports) of the stored flow record.

5.2.  Flow selection based on flow record arrival time or sequence

   Flow records can be selected based on their arrival time at the
   exporting process.  An example would be to select a number of flow
   records for certain periods of time.  Another option is to select
   flow records based on the order at which they arrive at the exporting
   process.  With this one can select systematically every kth record or
   select randomly a set of flow records.

5.3.  Flow selection on external events

   The selection of flow records can be alsio triggered by external
   events.  An example would be router state like number of entries in
   flow cache.


6.  Reporting of Flow Selection Information

   In this section we identify and describe in more detail some possible

Internet-Draft          Flow Selection Techniques             March 2010


   causes of flow selection, along with the information that can be
   beneficial to make available to applications about it.

6.1.  Flow selection in the metering process

   The main reason for applying in the metering process a flow state
   dependent sampling is that the flow recording process may not have,
   at a certain point in time, enough positions to record all observable
   flows.  Another reason may be that there may not be enough processing
   resources to create and manage a new flow record.  To overcome with
   these limitations, a number of possible policies can be applied, the
   simplest one being not to consider for measurement the new packets
   that do not belong to already existing flow records (i.e. that would
   require the creation of a new one).  More refined policies are
   however possible, mainly aimed at the so called elephant flow
   detection, i.e. to give priority in the flow recording process to
   flows carrying more traffic.  For instance, [EsVa01] proposes
   criteria to define a packet eligible to create a new flow record
   (sample and hold, multistage filters).  Independently of the specific
   algorithms, we are concerned here about defining what information it
   makes sense to keep about the flow state dependent packet sampling
   and make available to applications (by exporting it out of an IPFIX
   device).  It is certainly possible to keep a cumulative counter of
   the total number of packets and bytes that were not considered for
   measurement because of flow state dependent sampling.  Also, it is
   possible to keep a timestamp for the first and last of these non
   measured packets.  This means, in practice, to aggregate all these
   packets in a macro flow, and keep track of its volume and duration.
   Imagining keeping more detailed information about packets not
   measured because of flow state dependent sampling would contradict
   the fact that the sampling is done because of lack of memory and/or
   processing resources.

6.2.  Flow selection in the flow recording process

   This block is optional in the IPFIX framework architecture.  However,
   we address here the case where it is present.  We already described
   in the previous section that because of lack of memory positions in
   the flow recording process some incoming packets may be discarded if
   they lead to the opening of a new flow record.  However, under
   certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to discard an existing
   flow record in the flow recording process to make room for the new
   record opened by an arriving packet.  For example, an algorithm for
   taking the decision whether to discard the new arriving packet or an
   existing flow record is described in [Moli03].  In this section we
   are not concerned about the algorithm details but about what
   information to store about this record removal.  For the same reasons
   expressed before, we argue that it does not make sense to store

   separate information for each discarded flow record, as it would
   contradict the motivation itself for which the discarding is done
   (i.e. lack of memory resources).  The information that is certainly
   possible to keep with a limited effort is a cumulative counter of the
   total number of not yet exported packets and bytes belonging to flow
   records that were eliminated from the flow recording process.
   Ideally, we would also like to keep a timestamp for the first (T_fd)
   and last (T_ld) not yet exported packets belonging to all these
   discarded flow records.  This would mean, in practice, to aggregate
   all these packets in a macro flow, and keep track of its volume and
   duration.  To do so precisely, we would need to keep in each flow
   record a timestamp for the first and last non-exported packets, and
   whenever a record is discarded look at these timestamps to see if
   they are smaller or larger (respectively) of T_fd and T_ld and if yes
   update them.  Another information that can be easily kept is the
   number of these discarding events, along with a timestamp of the
   first and last of them.  This information should not be used by
   applications to re- normalize their received per flow statistics
   (because a flow may be discarded and re-created multiple times) but
   rather to keep under control the good functioning of the implemented
   policy.  Note that we consider a discarding event only when the
   discarded flow record contains some not exported traffic.  Otherwise,
   the removal of a record whose traffic was fully exported (after a
   timeout or after the arrival of specific packets, e.g.  TCP FIN or
   RST) is part of the normal functioning of an IPFIX flow metering
   system.  Note also that we consider only the case when an elimination
   of a flow record from the flow recording process leads to the
   complete loss of all the information contained in the flow record.
   If on the contrary another policy is implemented, like immediate
   exporting of the flow record before elimination, or freezing of the
   flow record and moving it in an area of memory different from which
   is considered the flow recording process for later exporting, this is
   not considered an elimination and therefore is out of the scope of
   this document.  In parallel to the information about the number of
   discarded flow records and associated packets and bytes, it is useful
   to keep cumulative information about the number of flow records
   containing not yet exported traffic that exist in the flow recording
   process, along with the cumulative number of not exported packets and
   bytes contained in them.  This information is useful also for
   exporting process related reasons, as clarified in the following
   paragraph.

6.3.  Flow selection in the exporting process

   The exporting process may implement policies for not exporting the
   whole set of flow records of the flow recording process.  In case of
   absence of the flow recording process, when the metering process
   directly feeds the exporting process (i.e. directly put the exported

   packets in the IPFIX format), the following reasoning does not apply.
   The motivations for not exporting some flow records (containing non
   exported traffic) can be two: there are explicit configured policies
   or the exporting process faces resource limitation.  An example of
   explicit policy can be not to export the flows whose accounted
   traffic is below a certain threshold, or a more complex mechanism
   such as the one described in [DuLT01a] or [DuLT01b].  An example of
   resource limitation is that the exporting process has an assigned,
   limited time slot to operate or a limited predefined number of export
   packets that it can send.  There can also be hybrid cases where there
   are resource limitations and policies are applied in order to
   optimize the exported information (e.g. given that we want to export
   only N flow records, select a subset so that the overall number of
   reported packets and bytes belonging to the subset is maximized).
   Coming to the issue of which information it makes sense to keep about
   this flow selection, there are two cases to consider.  If a flow is
   not exported and because of this decision is deleted from the flow
   recording process, we are in the same case described before (where
   the deletion was triggered by the need to make room for another
   record).  The information to keep is then naturally the same as
   described before (cumulative packets and bytes for all the flows not
   exported, timestamps of the first and last packets belonging to non
   exported flow records, counter of dropping events and timestamp of
   first and last dropping event).  Only the reason for this removal is
   different.  If on the contrary a record eligible for exporting is not
   exported but it remains in the flow recording process it has always a
   chance to be exported in the future.  For an application, however, it
   would be beneficial to know what it is not currently being exported
   because of exporting process policies/resource limitations, in terms
   of flow records, packets and bytes.  This, not to re-normalize its
   estimates (it would be dangerous and error prone because the
   exporting of these records may be simply delayed), but rather to keep
   under control what is happening: for example, understand if there are
   pathologic situations where a large number of flow records and/or
   associated traffic are never exported, or if the number of flow
   records in the flow recording process is growing, etc.  When it comes
   to understanding if this information can be easily available,
   however, we recognize that there is the problem that in order to be
   aware that it has not exported a flow record, an exporting process
   should at least have browsed through it.  In other words, we would
   have to assume that there is always a full scanning of the flow
   recording process associated to the exporting process selection
   decision.  However, there may be more efficient implementations where
   this does not happen.  Therefore, even if we provide support in the
   information model for this information, defining it as mandatory in
   the protocol definition would put a constraint on the exporting
   process implementation, which is undesirable.

7.  Information model for flow selection information exporting

   We formally define the elements to contain the information described
   in the previous section.  Some elements have an associated couple of
   timestamps, which we reference for brevity (when it is not ambiguous)
   as Tfirst and Tlast (instead of element_nameTfirst,
   element_nameTlast).  Note that all the following information elements
   are aimed at describing macro flows (e.g. the total number of packets
   and bytes contained in all dropped or not created flow records).
   Some of these macro flows are additive only, in the sense that they
   only add contributions to them, but never subtract.  E.g. the macro
   flow of the packets contained in flow records that are discarded from
   the flow reporting process receives a contribution when a flow record
   is discarded, and this contribution can never be subtracted.  On the
   contrary, some of the macro flows can dynamically receive and loose
   contributions.  E.g. the macro flows of packets not yet exported
   receives a contribution when a new packets arrives, and looses some
   contribution when there is an exporting event.  Associating a
   timestamp for the oldest and most recent contributions to additive
   only flow is easy, while for the others is not (would require to
   maintain full state) and that is why we did not define timestamps for
   these information elements.

   The information elements here introduced are defined in accordance
   with the IPFIX information model [RFC5102] to which reference should
   be made for more detailed information.  Furthermore, the data types
   used to formally rappresent the Flow Selection related information
   elements are those defined in section 3.1 of the IPFIX information
   model [RFC 2051].  For that reason, they are not redefined in this
   section.

8.  Requirements put on implementations

   To support the described information model an implementation must
   keep, in the flow records, counts for non-exported packets and bytes.
   Sometimes these are referred as delta counts.  An implementation may
   also keep absolute counts for scopes not specified in this
   information model (it appears that both delta and absolute counters
   can be exported in the IPFIX information model, see [RFC5102]).  In
   addition, to fully support this information model, it would be
   required to keep in a flow record a timestamp for the first and last
   non-exported packets.  An implementation may need to keep timestamps
   for the first and last exported packets as well for scopes not
   specified in this information model, or to join the two timers for
   the last exported and first exported packets (which is of course an
   approximation) or to approximate them with the time of the exporting
   event.

9.2.  flowMaxAdmitFlowRecords

   Description:

      This Information Element specifies the maximum number of elegible
      flow records which might be created in to the flow cache.  It is
      used by the Selector Process in order to identify the time when
      flow selection should be triggered.  A value of 0 means that the
      Flow Selection State related to the memory space available for
      flow recording must be used to estimate the max flow cache size.

      For example, this Information Element may be used to describe the
      configuration of a flow size count Flow Selector.

      This Information Element specifies the minimum number of bytes
      contained in a flow record to be considered not elegible for
      removal.  It may be used in order to identify elephant flows.

      For example, this Information Element may be used to describe the
      configuration of a flow size count Flow Selector.

   Abstract Data Type: unsigned64

   Data Type Semantics: quantity

   ElementId: TBD17

   Status: Proposed

   Units: bytes

9.4.  flowRecordPacketsSize

   Description:

      This Information Element specifies the minimum number of packets
      contained in a flow record to be considered not elegible for
      removal.  It may be used in order to identify elephant flows.

      For example, this Information Element may be used to describe the
      configuration of a flow size count Flow Selector.

   Abstract Data Type: unsigned32

   Data Type Semantics: quantity

   ElementId: TBD18

   Status: Proposed

   Units: packets

9.5.  flowInactivityTime

   Description:

      This Information Element specifies the time interval in
      microseconds during which the corresponding flow record may be
      considered still active.  It is used by the metering process
      and/or the flow recording process in order to take the decision
      whether to discard an existing flow to make room for a new one.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document descirbes methods for flow selection techniques that
   are applied in network measurements.  If users know or can guess the
   selection policies they may craft flows in a way to avoid beeing
   selected.  Furthermore network measurements are often used for the
   detecction of network attacks.  Therefore it has to be taken into
   account that flow selection may remove flows that are of interest for
   the detection taks. [more here]


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces several new information elements as an
   extension to the IPFIX information model.  IANA assignments should be
   created for the information elements described in this document.

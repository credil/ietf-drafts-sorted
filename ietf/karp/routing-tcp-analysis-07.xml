    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In March 2006, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) described an
      attack on core routing infrastructure as an ideal attack that would
      inflict the greatest amount of damage, in their <xref
      target="RFC4948">Report from the IAB workshop on Unwanted Traffic March
      9-10, 2006</xref>, and suggests steps to tighten the infrastructure
      against the attack. Four main steps were identified for that
      tightening:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Create secure mechanisms and practices for operating routers.</t>

          <t>Clean up the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) repository, and
          securing both the database and the access, so that it can be used
          for routing verifications.</t>

          <t>Create specifications for cryptographic validation of routing
          message content.</t>

          <t>Secure the routing protocols' packets on the wire.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In order to secure the routing protocols this document performs an
      initial analysis of the current state of the following TCP based
      protocols: BGP, LDP, PCEP, and MSDP according to the requirements of
      <xref target="RFC6518">KARP Design Guidelines </xref>. Section 4.2 of
      the document uses the term "state" which will be referred to as the
      "state of the security method". Thus a term like "Define Optimal State"
      would be referred to as "Define Optimal State of the Security Method".
      This document builds on several previous analysis efforts into routing
      security.</t>

    <section title="Current Assessment of BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP">
      <t>This section assesses the transport protocols for any authentication
      or integrity mechanisms used by the protocol. It describes the current
      security mechanisms if any used by BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP.</t>

      <section title="Transport layer">
        <t>At a transport layer, routing protocols are subject to a variety of
        DoS attacks, as outlined in <xref target="RFC4732">Internet
        Denial-of-Service Considerations</xref>. Such attacks can cause the
        routing protocol to become congested with the result that routing
        updates are supplied too slowly to be useful. In extreme cases, these
        attacks prevent routers from converging after a change.</t>

        <t>Routing protocols use several methods to protect themselves. Those
        that use TCP as a transport protocol use access lists to accept
        packets only from known sources. These access lists also help protect
        edge routers from attacks originating outside the protected domain. In
        addition, for edge routers running eBGP, TCP LISTEN is run only on
        interfaces on which its peers have been discovered or via which
        routing sessions are expected (as specified in router configuration
        databases).</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC5082">Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)
        </xref> describes a generalized Time to Live (TTL) security mechanism
        to protect a protocol stack from CPU-utilization based attacks.<xref
        target="RFC5961"> TCP Robustness</xref> recommends some TCP level
        mitigations against spoofing attacks targeted towards long-lived
        routing protocol sessions.</t>

        <t>Even when BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP sessions use access lists, they
        are vulnerable to spoofing and man in the middle attacks.
        Authentication and integrity checks allow the receiver of a routing
        protocol update to know that the message genuinely comes from the node
        that claims to have sent it, and to know whether the message has been
        modified. Sometimes routers can be subjected to a large number of
        authentication and integrity requests, exhausting connection resources
        on the router in a way that could lead to deny genuine requests.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC2385">TCP MD5</xref> has been obsoleted by <xref
        target="RFC5925">TCP-AO</xref>. However, it is still widely used to
        authenticate TCP based routing protocols such as BGP. It provides a
        way for carrying a MD5 digest in a TCP segment. This digest is
        computed using information known only to the end points and this
        ensures authenticity and integrity of messages. The MD5 key used to
        compute the digest is stored locally on the router. This option is
        used by routing protocols to provide for session level protection
        against the introduction of spoofed TCP segments into any existing TCP
        streams, in particular TCP Reset segments. TCP MD5 does not provide a
        generic mechanism to support key roll-over. It also does not support
        algorithm agility.</t>

        <t>The Message Authentication Codes (MACs) used by TCP MD5 option, is
        considered too weak both because of the use of the hash function and
        because of the way the secret key used by TCP MD5 is managed.
        Furthermore, TCP MD5 does not support any algorithm agility. <xref
        target="RFC5925">TCP-AO </xref>, and its companion document <xref
        target="RFC5926">Crypto Algorithms for TCP-AO</xref>, describe steps
        towards correcting both the MAC weakness and the management of secret
        keys. For MAC it requires that two MAC algorithms be supported. They
        are HMAC-SHA-1-96 as specified in <xref target="RFC2104">HMAC</xref>,
        and AES-128-CMAC-96 as specified in <xref
        target="NIST-SP800-38B">NIST-SP800-38B</xref>. Cryptographic research
        suggests that both these MAC algorithms defined are fairly secure. By
        supporting multiple MAC algorithms, TCP-AO supports algorithm agility.
        TCP-AO also allows additional MACs to be added in the future.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Keying mechanisms">
        <t>For <xref target="RFC5925">TCP-AO</xref> there is no Key Management
        Protocol (KMP) used to manage the keys that are employed to generate
        the Message Authentication Code (MAC). TCP-AO talks about coordinating
        keys derived from Master Key Table (MKT) between endpoints and allows
        for a master key to be configured manually or for it to be managed via
        a out of band mechanism.</t>

        <t>It should be noted that most routers configured with static keys
        have not seen the key changed ever. The common reason given for not
        changing the key is the difficulty in coordinating the change between
        pairs of routers when using TCP MD5. It is well known that the longer
        the same key is used, the greater the chance that it can be guessed or
        exposed e.g. when an administrator with knowledge of the keys leaves
        the company.</t>

        <t>For point-to-point key management <xref
        target="RFC5996">IKEv2</xref> protocol provides for automated key
        exchange under a SA, and can be used for a comprehensive Key
        Management Protocol (KMP) solution for routers. IKEv2 can be used for
        both <xref target="RFC4301">IPsec SAs</xref> and other types of SAs.
        For example, <xref target="RFC4595">Fibre Channel SAs</xref> are
        currently negotiated with IKEv2. Using IKEv2 to negotiate TCP-AO is a
        possible option.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="BGP">
        <t>All BGP communications take place over TCP. Therefore, all security
        vulnerabilities for BGP can be categorised as relating to the security
        of the transport protocol itself, or to the compromising of individual
        routers and the data they handle. This document examines the issues
        for the transport protocol, while the SIDR Working Group (WG) looks at
        ways to sign and secure the data exchanged in BGP as described in
        <xref target="RFC6480">An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet
        Protocol</xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="LDP">
        <t><xref target="RFC5920">Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS
        Networks</xref> outlines security aspects that are relevant in the
        context of MPLS and GMPLS. It describes the security threats, the
        related defensive techniques, and the mechanism for detection and
        reporting.</t>

        <t>Section 5 of <xref target="RFC5036">LDP</xref> states that LDP is
        subject to two different types of attacks: spoofing, and denial of
        service attacks.</t>

        <section title="Spoofing attacks">
          <t>A spoofing attack against LDP can occur both during the discovery
          phase and during the session communication phase.</t>

          <section title="Discovery exchanges using UDP">
            <t>Label Switching Routers (LSRs) indicate their willingness to
            establish and maintain LDP sessions by periodically sending Hello
            messages. Reception of a Hello message serves to create a new
            "Hello adjacency", if one does not already exist, or to refresh an
            existing one.</t>

            <t>There are two variants of the discovery mechanism. A Basic
            Discovery mechanism that is used to discover LSR neighbors that
            are directly connected at the link level and a Extended Discovery
            mechanism that is used by LSRs that are more than one hop
            away.</t>

            <t>Unlike all other LDP messages, the Hello messages are sent
            using UDP. This means that they cannot benefit from the security
            mechanisms available with TCP. <xref target="RFC5036">LDP</xref>
            does not provide any security mechanisms for use with Hello
            messages except for some configuration which may help protect
            against bogus discovery events. These configurations include
            directly connected links and interfaces. Routers that do not use
            directly connected links have to use Extended Discovery mechanism,
            and will not be able to use configuration to protect against bogus
            discovery events.</t>

            <t>Spoofing a Hello packet for an existing adjacency can cause the
            adjacency to time out and result in termination of the associated
            session. This can occur when the spoofed Hello message specifies a
            small Hold Time, causing the receiver to expect Hello messages
            within this interval, while the true neighbor continues sending
            Hello messages at the lower, previously agreed to frequency.</t>

            <t>Spoofing a Hello packet can also cause the LDP session to be
            terminated. This can occur when the spoofed Hello specifies a
            different Transport Address from the previously agreed one between
            neighbors. Spoofed Hello messages are observed and reported as
            real problem in production networks.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Session communication using TCP">
            <t>LDP like other TCP based routing protocols specifies use of the
            TCP MD5 Signature Option to provide for the authenticity and
            integrity of session messages. As stated in section 2.1 of this
            document and in section 2.9 of <xref target="RFC5036">LDP </xref>,
            MD5 authentication is considered too weak for this application as
            outlined in <xref target="RFC6151">MD5 and HMAC-MD5 Security
            Considerations</xref>. It also does not support algorithm agility.
            A stronger hashing algorithm e.g SHA1, which is supported by <xref
            target="RFC5925">TCP-AO</xref> could be deployed to take care of
            the weakness.</t>

            <t>Alternatively, one could move to using TCP-AO which provides
            for stronger MAC algorithms, makes it easier to setup manual keys
            and protects against replay attacks.</t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section title="Denial of Service Attacks">
          <t>LDP is subject to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks both in its
          discovery mode and in session mode. These are documented in Section
          5.3 of <xref target="RFC5036">LDP</xref>.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="PCEP">
        <t>For effective selection by PCCs, a PCC needs to know the location
        of PCEs in its domain along with some information relevant for PCE
        selection. Such PCE information could be learned through manual
        configuration, on each PCC, along with their capabilities or
        automatically through a PCE discovery mechanism as outlined in <xref
        target="RFC4674">Requirements for PCE Discovery</xref>.</t>

        <t>Attacks on <xref target="RFC5440">PCEP</xref> may result in damage
        to active networks. These include computation responses, which if
        changed can cause protocols like <xref target="RFC3209">RSVP-TE</xref>
        to setup sub-optimal or inappropriate LSPs. In addition, PCE itself
        can attacked by a variety of DoS attacks. Such attacks can cause path
        computations to be supplied too slowly to be of any value particularly
        as it relates to recovery or establishment of LSPs.</t>

        <t>Finally, PCE discovery as outlined in <xref target="RFC5088">OSPF
        Protocol Extensions for PCE Discovery </xref> and <xref
        target="RFC5089">IS-IS Protocol Extensions for PCE Discovery</xref> is
        a significant feature for the successful deployment of PCEP in large
        networks. These mechanisms allow PCC to discover the existence of PCEs
        within the network. If the discovery mechanism is compromised, it will
        impair the ability of the nodes to function as described below.</t>

        <t>As RFC 5440 states, PCEP which makes use of TCP as a transport,
        could be the target of the following attacks:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Spoofing (PCC or PCE implementation)</t>

            <t>Snooping (message interception)</t>

            <t>Falsification</t>

            <t>Denial of Service</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In inter-Autonomous Systems (AS) scenarios where PCE-to-PCE
        communication is required, attacks may be particularly significant
        with commercial as well as service-level agreement implications.</t>

        <t>Additionally, snooping of PCEP requests and responses may give an
        attacker information about the operation of the network. By viewing
        the PCEP messages an attacker can determine the pattern of service
        establishment in the network, and can know where traffic is being
        routed, thereby making the network susceptible to targeted attacks and
        the data within specific LSPs vulnerable.</t>

        <t>Ensuring PCEP communication privacy is of key importance,
        especially in an inter-AS context, where PCEP communication end-points
        do not reside in the same AS. An attacker that intercepts a PCE
        message could obtain sensitive information related to computed paths
        and resources.</t>

        <t>At the time PCEP was documented in <xref target="RFC5440"></xref>,
        TCP-AO had not been fully specified. Therefore, <xref
        target="RFC5440"></xref> mandates that PCEP implementations include
        support for TCP-MD5, and that use of the function should be
        configurable by the operator. <xref target="RFC5440"></xref> also
        describes the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of TCP-MD5 as noted in
        this document. <xref target="RFC5440"></xref> goes on to state that
        PCEP implementations should include support for TCP-AO as soon as that
        specification is complete. Since <xref target="RFC5925">TCP-AO</xref>
        has now been published, new PCEP implementation should fully support
        TCP-AO.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MSDP">
        <t>Similar to BGP and LDP, Multicast Source Distribution Protocol
        (MSDP) uses <xref target="RFC2385">TCP MD5</xref> to protect TCP
        sessions via the TCP MD5 option. But with a weak MD5 authentication,
        TCP MD5 is not considered strong enough for this application. It also
        does not support algorithm agility.</t>

        <t>MSDP also advocates imposing a limit on number of source address
        and group addresses (S,G) that can be cached within the protocol and
        thereby mitigate state explosion due to any denial of service and
        other attacks.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Optimal State for BGP, LDP, PCEP, and MSDP">
      <t>The ideal state of the security method for BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP
      protocols are when they can withstand any of the known types of attacks.
      The protocols also need to support algorithm agility, i.e. they must not
      hardwire themselves to one algorithm.</t>

      <t>Additionally, Key Management Protocol (KMP) for the routing sessions
      should help negotiate unique, pair wise random keys without
      administrator involvement. It should also negotiate Security Association
      (SA) parameters required for the session connection, including key life
      times. It should keep track of those lifetimes and negotiate new keys
      and parameters before they expire and do so without administrator
      involvement. In the event of a breach, including when an administrator
      with knowledge of the keys leaves the company, the keys should be
      changed immediately.</t>

      <t>The DoS attacks for BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP are attacks to the
      transport protocol, TCP for the most part and UDP in case of discovery
      phase of LDP. TCP and UDP should be able to withstand any of DoS
      scenarios by dropping packets that are attack packets in a way that does
      not impact legitimate packets.</t>

      <t>The routing protocols should provide a mechanism to authenticate the
      routing information carried within the payload and administrators should
      enable it.</t>

      <section title="LDP">
        <t>To harden LDP against its current vulnerability to spoofing
        attacks, LDP needs to be upgraded such that an implementation is able
        to determine the authenticity of the neighbors sending the Hello
        message.</t>

        <t>Labels are similar to routing information which is distributed in
        the clear. However, there is currently no requirement that the labels
        be encrypted. And stated before, is currently out of scope of this
        document.</t>

        <t>Similarly, it is important to ensure that routers exchanging labels
        are mutually authenticated, and that there are no rogue peers or
        unauthenticated peers that can compromise the stability of the
        network.</t>

    <section title="Gap Analysis for BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP">
      <t>This section outlines the differences between the current state of
      the security methods for routing protocols, and the desired state of the
      security methods as outlined in section 4.2 of <xref
      target="RFC6518">KARP Design Guidelines </xref>. As that document
      states, these routing protocols fall into the category of one-to-one
      peering messages and will use peer keying protocol. It covers issues
      that are common to the four protocols in this section, leaving protocol
      specific issues to sub-sections.</t>

      <t>At a transport level these routing protocols are subject to some of
      the same attacks that TCP applications are subject to. These include DoS
      and spoofing attacks. <xref target="RFC4732">Internet Denial-of-Service
      Considerations</xref> outlines some solutions. <xref
      target="RFC4953">Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks</xref>
      recommends ways to prevent spoofing attacks. In addition, the
      recommendations in <xref target="RFC5961"></xref> should also be
      followed and implemented to strengthen TCP.</t>

      <t>Routers lack comprehensive key management and keys derived from it
      that they can use to authenticate data. As an example <xref
      target="RFC5925">TCP-AO</xref>, talks about coordinating keys derived
      from Master Key Table (MKT) between endpoints, but the MKT itself has to
      be configured manually or through an out of band mechanism. Also TCP-AO
      does not address the issue of connectionless reset, as it applies to
      routers that do not store MKT across reboots.</t>

      <t>Authentication, integrity protection, and encryption all require the
      use of keys by sender and receiver. An automated KMP therefore has to
      include a way to distribute key material between two end points with
      little or no administration overhead. It has to cover automatic key
      rollover. It is expected that authentication will cover the packet, i.e.
      the payload and the TCP header and will not cover the frame i.e. the
      link layer 2 header.</t>

      <t>There are two methods of automatic key rollover. Implicit key
      rollover can be initiated after certain volume of data gets exchanged or
      when a certain time has elapsed. This does not require explicit
      signaling nor should it result in a reset of the TCP connection in a way
      that the links/adjacencies are affected. On the other hand, explicit key
      rollover requires an out of band key signaling mechanism. It can be
      triggered by either side and can be done anytime a security parameter
      changes e.g. an attack has happened, or a system administrator with
      access to the keys has left the company. An example of this is <xref
      target="RFC5996">IKEv2</xref>, but it could be any other new mechanisms
      also.</t>

      <t>As stated earlier <xref target="RFC5925">TCP-AO</xref>, and its
      accompanying document <xref target="RFC5926">Crypto Algorithms for
      TCP-AO </xref>, requires that two MAC algorithms be supported, and they
      are HMAC-SHA-1-96 as specified in <xref target="RFC2104">HMAC</xref>,
      and AES-128-CMAC-96 as specified in <xref
      target="NIST-SP800-38B">NIST-SP800-38B</xref>. Therefore, TCP-AO meets
      the algorithm agility requirement.</t>

      <t>There is a need to protect authenticity and validity of the
      routing/label information that is carried in the payload of the
      sessions. However, that is outside the scope of this document and is
      being addressed by SIDR WG. Similar mechanisms could be used for
      intra-domain protocols.</t>

      <t>Finally, replay protection is required. The replay mechanism needs to
      be sufficient to prevent an attacker from creating a denial of service
      or disrupting the integrity of the routing protocol by replaying
      packets. It is important that an attacker not be able to disrupt service
      by capturing packets and waiting for replay state to be lost.</t>

      <section title="LDP">
        <t>As described in <xref target="RFC5036">LDP</xref>, the threat of
        spoofed Basic Hellos can be reduced by only accepting Basic Hellos on
        interfaces that LSRs trust, employing <xref
        target="RFC5082">GTSM</xref> and ignoring Basic Hellos not addressed
        to the "all routers on this subnet" multicast group. Spoofing attacks
        via Targeted Hellos are potentially a more serious threat. An LSR can
        reduce the threat of spoofed Extended Hellos by filtering them and
        accepting Hellos from sources permitted by an access lists. However,
        performing the filtering using access lists requires LSR resource, and
        the LSR is still vulnerable to the IP source address spoofing.
        Spoofing attacks can be solved by being able to authenticate the Hello
        messages, and an LSR can be configured to only accept Hello messages
        from specific peers when authentication is in use.</t>

        <t><xref target="draft-zheng-mpls-ldp-hello-crypto-auth-04">LDP Hello
        Cryptographic Authentication</xref> suggest a new Cryptographic
        Authentication TLV that can be used as an authentication mechanism to
        secure Hello messages.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="PCEP">
        <t>Path Computation Element (PCE) discovery according to <xref
        target="RFC5440">its RFC</xref>, is a significant feature for the
        successful deployment of PCEP in large networks. This mechanism allows
        a Path Computation Client (PCC) to discover the existence of suitable
        PCEs within the network without the necessity of configuration. It
        should be obvious that, where PCEs are discovered and not configured,
        the PCC cannot know the correct key to use. There are different
        approaches to retain some aspect of security, but all of them require
        use of a keys and a keying mechanism, the need for which has been
        discussed above.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Transition and Deployment Considerations">
      <t>As stated in <xref target="RFC6518">KARP Design Guidelines</xref>, it
      is imperative that the new authentication, security mechanisms defined,
      and key management protocol support incremental deployment, as it is not
      feasible to deploy the new routing protocol authentication mechanism
      overnight.</t>

      <t>Typically, authentication and security in a peer-to-peer protocol
      requires that both parties agree to the mechanisms that will be used. If
      an agreement is not reached the setup of the new mechanism will fail or
      will be deferred. Upon failure, the routing protocols can fallback to
      the mechanisms that were already in place e.g. use static keys if that
      was the mechanism in place. The fallback should be configurable on a
      per-node or per-interface. It is usually not possible for one end to use
      the new mechanism while the other end uses the old. Policies can be put
      in place to retry upgrading after a said period of time, so a manual
      coordination is not required.</t>

      <t>If the automatic KMP requires use of <xref target="RFC5280">Public
      Key Infrastructure Certificates</xref> to exchange key material, the
      required Certificate Authority (CA) root certificates may need to be
      installed to verify authenticity of requests initiated by a peer. Such a
      step does not require coordination with the peer except to decide what
      CA authority will be used.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This section describes security considerations that BGP, LDP, PCEP
      and MSDP should try to meet.</t>

      <t>As with all routing protocols, they need protection from both on-path
      and off-path blind attacks. A better way to protect them would be with
      per-packet protection using a cryptographic MAC. In order to provide for
      the MAC, keys are needed.</t>

      <t>The routing protocols need to support algorithm agility, i.e. they
      must not hardwire themselves to one algorithm.</t>

      <t>Once keys are used, mechanisms are required to support key rollover.
      This should cover both manual and automatic key rollover. Multiple
      approaches could be used. However, since the existing mechanisms provide
      a protocol field to identify the key as well as management mechanisms to
      introduce and retire new keys, focusing on the existing mechanism as a
      starting point is prudent.</t>

      <t>Furthermore, it is strongly suggested that these routing protocols
      need to support algorithm agility. It has been proven that algorithms
      weaken over time. Supporting algorithm agility assists in smooth
      transition from old to new algorithms.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>Different routing protocols employ different mechanisms for securing
      protocol packets on the wire. While most already have some method for
      accomplishing cryptographic message authentication, in many cases the
      existing methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and employ
      cryptographic algorithms that have been deprecated. The "Keying and
      Authentication for Routing Protocols" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul and
      improve these mechanisms.</t>

      <t>This document does not contain protocol specifications. Instead, it
      defines the areas where protocol specification work is needed and a set
      of requirements for KARP design teams to follow. RFC 6518, "Keying and
      Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines" is a
      companion to this document; KARP design teams will use them together to
      review and overhaul routing protocols. These two documents reflect the
      input of both the IETF Security Area and IETF Routing Area in order to
      form a mutually agreeable work plan.</t>

      <t>This document has three main parts. The first part provides an
      overview of the KARP effort. The second part lists the threats from RFC
      4593 (Generic Threats To Routing Protocols) that are in scope for
      attacks against routing protocol transport systems. This includes any
      mechanisms built into the routing protocols themselves, to authenticate
      packets. The third part enumerates the requirements that routing
      protocol specifications must meet when addressing those threats for RFC
      6518's "Work Phase 1", the update to a routing protocol's existing
      transport security.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In March 2006 the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop
      on the topic of "Unwanted Internet Traffic". The report from that
      workshop is documented in <xref target="RFC4948"></xref>. Section 8.1 of
      that document states "A simple risk analysis would suggest that an ideal
      attack target of minimal cost but maximal disruption is the core routing
      infrastructure." Section 8.2 calls for "[t]ightening the security of the
      core routing infrastructure." Four main steps were identified for that
      tightening:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Create secure mechanisms and practices for operating routers.</t>

          <t>Clean up the Internet Routing Registry repository (IRR), and
          securing both the database and the access, so that it can be used
          for routing verification.</t>

          <t>Create specifications for cryptographic validation of routing
          message content.</t>

          <t>Secure the routing protocols' packets on the wire</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The first bullet is being addressed in the OPSEC working group. The
      second bullet should be addressed through liaisons with those running
      the IRR's globally. The third bullet is being addressed in other efforts
      within the IETF. For example, BGP message content validity is being
      addressed in the SIDR working group.</t>

      <t>This document addresses the last item in the list above, securing the
      transmission of routing protocol packets on the wire. More precisely, it
      focuses on securing the transport systems employed by routing protocols,
      including any mechanisms built into the protocols themselves to
      authenticate packets. This effort is referred to as Keying and
      Authentication for Routing Protocols, or "KARP". KARP is concerned with
      issues and techniques for protecting the messages between directly
      communicating peers. This may overlap with, but is strongly distinct
      from, protection designed to ensure that routing information is properly
      authorized relative to the source of the information. Such assurances
      are provided by other mechanisms and are outside the scope of this
      document.</t>

      <t>This document is one of two that together form the guidance and
      instructions for KARP design teams working to overhaul routing protocol
      transport security. The other document is the KARP Design Guide <xref
      target="RFC6518"> </xref>.</t>

      <t>This document does not contain protocol specifications. Instead, its
      goal is to define the areas where protocol specification work is needed
      and to provide a set of requirements for KARP design teams to follow as
      they update a routing protocol's existing transport security (see<xref
      target="RFC6518"> </xref>, Section 4.1's "Work Phase 1").</t>

      <t>This document has three main parts. The first part, found in Section
      2, provides an overview of the KARP effort. Section 3 lists the threats
      from <xref target="RFC4593"></xref>, (Generic Threats To Routing
      Protocols), that are in scope for per-packet authentication for routing
      protocol transport systems. Therefore, this document does not contain a
      complete threat model; it simply points to the parts of the governing
      threat model that KARP design teams must address, and explicitly states
      which parts are out of scope for KARP design teams. Section 4 enumerates
      the requirements that routing protocol specifications must meet when
      addressing those threats related to KARP's "Work Phase 1", the update to
      a routing protocol's existing transport security. ("Work Phase 2", a
      framework and usage of a KMP, will be addressed in a future
      document[s]).</t>

      <t>This document uses the terminology "on the wire" to refer to the
      information used by routing protocols' transport systems. This term is
      widely used in IETF RFCs, but is used in several different ways. In this
      document, it is used to refer both to information exchanged between
      routing protocol instances, and to underlying protocols that may also
      need to be protected in specific circumstances. Individual protocol
      analysis documents will need to be more specific in their use of this
      phrase.</t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>Within the scope of this document, the following words, when
        beginning with a capital letter, or spelled in all capitals, hold the
        meanings described immediately following each term. If the same word
        is used uncapitalized, then it is intended to have its common English
        definition.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t>Identifier</t>

            <t>The type and value used by a peer of an authenticated message
            exchange to signify who it is to another peer. The Identifier is
            used by the receiver as an index into a table containing further
            information about the peer that is required to continue processing
            the message, for example a Security Association (SA) or keys.</t>

            <t>Identity Authentication</t>

            <t>Once the identity is verified, then there must be a
            cryptographic proof of that identity, that the peer really is who
            it asserts to be. Proof of identity can be arranged among peers in
            a few ways, for example symmetric and asymmetric pre-shared keys,
            or an asymmetric key contained in a certificate. Certificates can
            be used in ways that requires no additional supporting systems
            external to the routers themselves. An example of this would be
            using self signed certificates and a flat file list of "approved
            thumbprints". The use of these different identity verification
            mechanisms vary in ease of deployment, ease of ongoing management,
            startup effort, security strength, and consequences from loss of
            secrets from one part of the system to the rest of the system. For
            example, they differ in resistance to a security breach, and the
            effort required to recover in the event of such a breach. The
            point here is that there are options, many of which are quite
            simple to employ and deploy.</t>

            <t>KDF (Key derivation function)</t>

            <t>A KDF is a function in which an input key and other input data
            is used to generate keying material that can be employed by
            cryptographic algorithms. The key that is input to a KDF is called
            a key derivation key. KDFs can be used to generate one or more
            keys from either (i) a random or pseudorandom seed value or (ii)
            result of the Diffie-Hellman exchange or (iii) a non-uniform
            random source (e.g., from a non-deterministic random bit
            generator) or (iv) a pre-shared key which may or may not be
            memorable by a human.</t>

            <t>KMP (Key Management Protocol)</t>

            <t>A protocol to establish a shared symmetric key between a pair
            (or among a group) of users. It determines how secret keys are
            made available to the users and in some cases also determines how
            the secret keys are generated. In some routing protocols traffic
            keys are derived by the routing protocol from a master key. In
            this case, KMP is responsible for the master key generation and
            for determining when it should be renewed. In other cases, there
            are only traffic keys (and no master key), and in such a case KMP
            is responsible for the traffic key generation and renewal
            mechanism.</t>

            <t>KMP Function</t>

            <t>Any KMP used in the general KARP solution framework</t>

            <t>Peer Key</t>

            <t>Keys that are used among peers as a basis for identifying one
            another. These keys may or may not be connection-specific,
            depending on how they were established, and what forms of identity
            and identity authentication mechanism are used in the system. A
            peer key generally would be provided by a KMP and would later be
            used to derive fresh traffic keys.</t>

            <t>PSK (Pre-Shared Key)</t>

            <t>A key used to communicate with one or more peers in a secure
            configuration. Always distributed out-of-band prior to a first
            connection.</t>

            <t>Replayed Messages</t>

            <t>Replayed messages are genuine messages that have been re-sent
            by an attacker. Messages may be replayed within a session (i.e.,
            intra-session) or replayed from a different session (i.e.,
            inter-session). For non-TCP based protocols like OSPF <xref
            target="RFC2328"></xref>, IS-IS <xref target="RFC1195"></xref>,
            etc., two routers are said to have a session up if they are able
            to exchange protocol packets (i.e., the peers have an adjacency).
            Messages replayed during an adjacency are intra-session replays
            while message replayed between two peers who re-establish an
            adjacency after a reboot or loss of connectivity are inter-session
            replays.</t>

            <t>Routing Protocol</t>

            <t>When used with capital "R" and "P" in this document the term
            refers the Routing Protocol for which work is being done to its
            packets on the wire.</t>

            <t>SA (Security Association)</t>

            <t>A relationship established between two or more entities to
            enable them to protect data they exchange. Examples of attributes
            that may be associated with an SA include: Identifier, PSK,
            Traffic Key, cryptographic algorithms, key lifetimes.</t>

            <t>Threat Source</t>

            <t>A threat source is a motivated, capable adversary.</t>

            <t>Traffic Key</t>

            <t>The key (or one of a set of keys) used for protecting the
            routing protocol traffic. A traffic key should not be a fixed
            value in a device configuration. A traffic key should be known
            only to the participants in a connection, so that a compromise of
            a stored key (possibly available to a terminated or turned
            employee) does not result in disclosure of traffic keys. If a
            server or other data store is stolen or compromised, the attackers
            gain no access to current traffic keys. They may gain access to
            key derivation material, like a PSK, but not current traffic keys
            in use.</t>
          </list></t>

        below in the Threats <xref target="Threats"></xref> section.</t>

    <section title="KARP Effort Overview">
      <section title="KARP Scope">
        <t>Three basic principles are possible to secure any piece of data as
        it is transmitted over the wire: confidentiality, authenticity, and
        integrity. The focus for the KARP working group will be message
        authentication and message integrity only. This work explicitly
        excludes, at this point in time, confidentiality. Non-repudiation is
        also excluded as a goal at this time. Since the objective of most
        routing protocols is to broadly advertise the routing topology,
        routing protocol packets are commonly sent in the clear;
        confidentiality is not normally required for routing protocols.
        However, ensuring that routing peers are authentically identified, and
        that no rogue peers or unauthenticated packets can compromise the
        stability of the routing environment is critical, and thus in scope.
        Confidentiality and non-repudiation may be addressed in future
        work.</t>

        <t>OSPF <xref target="RFC5709"> </xref>, IS-IS <xref target="RFC5310">
        </xref>, LDP <xref target="RFC5036"> </xref>, and RIP <xref
        target="RFC2453"> </xref> <xref target="RFC4822"> </xref> already
        incorporate mechanisms for cryptographically authenticating and
        integrity checking the messages on the wire. Products with these
        mechanisms have been produced, code has been written, and have been
        optimized for these existing security mechanisms. Rather than turn
        away from these mechanisms, this document aims to enhance them,
        updating them to modern and secure levels.</t>

        <t>Therefore, the scope of KARP's roadmap of work includes:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Making use of existing routing protocol transport security
            mechanisms, where they have been specified, and enhancing or
            updating them as necessary for modern cryptographic best
            practices. <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref>, Section 4.1 labels
            this KARP's "Work Phase 1."</t>

            <t>Developing a framework for using automatic key management in
            order to ease deployment, lower cost of operation, and allow for
            rapid responses to security breaches. <xref target="RFC6518">
            </xref>, Section 4.1 labels this KARP's "Work Phase 2."</t>

            <t>Specifying an automated key management protocol that may be
            combined with Routing Protocol mechanisms. <xref target="RFC6518">
            </xref>, Section 4.1 labels this KARP's "Work Phase 2."</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Neither this document nor <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref> contain
        protocol specifications. Instead, they define the areas where protocol
        specification work is needed and set a direction, a set of
        requirements, and priorities for addressing that specification
        work.</t>

        <t>There are a set of threats to routing protocols that are considered
        in-scope for KARP, and a set considered out-of- scope. These are
        described in detail in the Threats (Section 3) section below.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="IncrementalApproach" title="Incremental Approach">
        <t>This document also serves as an agreement between the Routing Area
        and the Security Area about the priorities and work plan for
        incrementally delivering the above work. The principle of "crawl,
        walk, run" will be employed. Thus routing protocol authentication
        mechanisms may not go immediately from their current state to a state
        reflecting the best possible, most modern security practices. This
        point is important as there will be times when the
        best-security-possible will give way to
        vastly-improved-over-current-security-but-admittedly-not-yet-best-security-possible,
        in order that incremental progress toward a more secure Internet may
        be achieved. As such, this document will call out places where
        agreement has been reached on such trade offs.</t>

        <t>Incremental steps will need to be taken for a few very practical
        reasons. First, there are a considerable number of deployed routing
        devices in operating networks that will not be able to run the most
        modern cryptographic mechanisms without significant and unacceptable
        performance penalties. The roadmap for any routing protocol MUST allow
        for incremental improvements on existing operational devices. Second,
        current routing protocol performance on deployed devices has been
        achieved over the last 20 years through extensive tuning of software
        and hardware elements, and is a constant focus for improvement by
        vendors and operators alike. The introduction of new security
        mechanisms affects this performance balance. The performance impact of
        any incremental security improvement will need to be weighed by the
        community, and introduced in such a way that allows the vendor and
        operator community a path to adoption that upholds reasonable
        performance metrics. Therefore, certain specification elements may be
        introduced carrying the "SHOULD" guidance, with the intention that the
        same mechanism will carry a "MUST" in a future release of the
        specification. This approach gives the vendors and implementors the
        guidance they need to tune their software and hardware appropriately
        over time. Last, some security mechanisms require the build out of
        other operational support systems, and this will take time.</t>

        <t>An example where these three reasons were at play in an incremental
        improvement roadmap was seen in the improvement of BGP's [RFC4271]
        security via the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] effort.
        It would have been ideal, and reflected best common security practice,
        to have a fully specified key management protocol for negotiating
        TCP-AO's keying material, e.g., using certificates for peer
        authentication. However, in the spirit of incremental deployment, the
        IETF first addressed issues like cryptographic algorithm agility,
        replay attacks, and TCP session resetting in the base TCP-AO protocol,
        and then later began work to layer key management on top of it.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Goals">
        <t>The goals and general guidance for the KARP work follow.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Provide authentication and integrity protection for messages on
            the wire for existing routing protocols.</t>

            <t>Define a path to incrementally improve security of the routing
            infrastructure as explained in <xref
            target="IncrementalApproach"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Ensure that the improved security solutions are deployable on
            current routing infrastructure. This requires consideration of the
            current state of processing power available on routers in the
            network today.</t>

            <t>Operational deployability - A solution's acceptability also
            will be measured by how deployable the solution is by operator
            teams, with consideration for their deployment processes and
            infrastructures. Specifically, KARP design teams will try to make
            these solutions fit as well as possible into current operational
            practices and router deployment methodologies. Doing so will
            depend heavily on operator input during KARP design efforts.
            Hopefully, operator input will lead to a more deployable solution,
            which will, in turn, lead to more production deployments.
            Deployment of incrementally more secure routing infrastructure in
            the Internet is the final measure of success. We would like to see
            an increase in the number of respondents to surveys such as <xref
            target="ISR2008"></xref> to report deploying the updated
            authentication and integrity mechanisms in their networks, as well
            as see a sharp rise in usage for the total percentage of their
            network's routers. <vspace blankLines="1" /> Interviews with
            operators show several points about routing security. First,
            according to <xref target="ISR2008"></xref>, over 70% of operators
            have deployed transport connection protection via TCP-MD5 <xref
            target="RFC3562"> </xref> on their exterior Border Gateway
            Protocol (eBGP) sessions. Over 55% also deploy TCP-MD5 on their
            interior Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP) connections, and 50% make
            use of TCP-MD5 offered on some other internal gateway protocol
            (IGP). The same survey states that "a considerable increase was
            observed over previous editions of the survey for use of TCP MD5
            with external peers (eBGP), internal peers (iBGP) and MD5
            extensions for IGPs." Though the data is not captured in the
            report, the authors believe anecdotally that of those who have
            deployed TCP-MD5 somewhere in their network, only about 25-30% of
            the routers in their network are deployed with the authentication
            enabled. None report using IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"> </xref>
            to protect the routing protocol, and this was a decline from the
            few that reported doing so in the previous year's report.
            Anecdotal evidence from operators using MD5 shows that almost all
            report using one, manually-distributed key throughout the entire
            network. These same operators report that the single key has not
            been changed since it was originally installed, sometimes five or
            more years ago. When asked why, particularly for the case of
            protecting BGP sessions using TCP MD5, the following reasons are
            often given: <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="A.">Changing the keys triggers a TCP reset, and
                thus bounces the links/adjacencies, undermining Service Level
                Agreements (SLAs).</t>

                <t hangText="B.">For external peers, the difficulty of
                coordination with the other organization is an issue. Once
                they find the correct contact at the other organization (not
                always so easy), the coordination function is serialized and
                on a per peer/AS basis. The coordination is very cumbersome
                and tedious to execute in practice.</t>

                <t hangText="C.">Keys must be changed at precisely the same
                time, or at least within 60 seconds (as supported by two major
                vendors) in order to limit connectivity outage duration. This
                is incredibly difficult to do, operationally, especially
                between different organizations.</t>

                <t hangText="D.">Key change is perceived as a relatively low
                priority compared to other operational issues.</t>

                <t hangText="E.">Lack of staff to implement the changes on a
                device-by-device basis.</t>

                <t hangText="F.">There are three use cases for operational
                peering at play here: peers and interconnection with other
                operators, iBGP and other routing sessions within a single
                operator, and operator-to-customer devices. All three have
                very different properties, and all are reported as cumbersome
                to manage securely. One operator reported that the same key is
                used for all customer premise equipment (CPE). The same
                operator reported that if the customer mandated it, a unique
                key could be created, although the last time this occurred it
                created such an operational headache that the administrators
                now usually tell customers that the option doesn't even exist,
                to avoid the difficulties. These customer-unique keys are
                never changed, unless the customer demands so. The main threat
                here is that a terminated employee from such an operator who
                had access to the one (or several) keys used for
                authentication in these environments could wage an attack.
                Alternatively, the operator could offer the keys to others who
                would wage the attack. In either case, the attacker could then
                bring down many of the adjacencies, causing destabilization to
                the routing system.</t>

            than the current methods, and should provide obvious operational

            as much as possible across relevant Routing Protocols. For
            example, designers should aim to re-use the key management
            protocol that will be defined for BGP, which will establish keys

            <t>Routing Area working group chairs and participants - These
            people are charged with updated Routing Protocol specifications.
            Any and all cryptographic authentication work on these
            specifications will occur in Routing Area working groups, in close
            partnership with the Security Area. Co-advisors from the Security
            Area may often be named for these partnership efforts.</t>

            <t>Security Area reviewers of routing area documents - These
            people are tasked by the Security Area Directors to perform
            reviews on routing protocol specifications as they pass through
            working group last call or IESG review. Their particular attention
            to the use of cryptographic authentication and newly specified
            security mechanisms for the routing protocols is appreciated. They
            also help to ensure that incremental security improvements are
            being made, in line with this roadmap.</t>

            <t>Security Area engineers - These people partner with routing

            the work is considered to have succeeded only if operators deploy
            the technology. It is anticipated that deployment will take place
            only if operators perceive that the improved security offered by
            the Routing Protocol updates warrant the complexity and cost of
            deployment and operation. Conversely, the work will be considered
            a failure if operators do not deploy it, either due to lack of
            perceived value or due to perceived operational complexity. As a
            result, the GROW and OPSEC WGs should be kept squarely in the loop

    <section anchor="Threats" title="Threats">
      <t>This document uses the definition of "threat" from RFC4949 <xref
      target="RFC4949"></xref>: "a potential for violation of security, which
      exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that
      could breach security and cause harm."</t>

      <t>This section defines the threats that are in scope for the KARP
      effort. It also lists those threats that are explicitly out of scope for
      the KARP effort. Threats are discussed assuming that no protection
      (i.e., message authentication and message integrity) has been applied to
      routing protocol messages.</t>

      <t>This document leverages the "Generic Threats to Routing Protocols"
      model, <xref target="RFC4593"></xref>. Specifically, the threats below
      were derived by reviewing <xref target="RFC4593"></xref>, analyzing the
      KARP problem space relative to it, and listing the threats that are
      applicable to the KARP design teams' work. This document categorizes
      <xref target="RFC4593"></xref> threats into those in scope and those out
      of scope for KARP. Each in-scope threat is discussed below, and its
      applicability to the KARP problem space is described. As such, the
      following text intentionally is not a comprehensive threat analysis.
      Rather it describes the applicability of the existing threat analysis
      <xref target="RFC4593"></xref> to KARP.</t>

      <t>Note: terms from <xref target="RFC4593"></xref> appear capitalized

      to enable rapid cross referencing to the source RFC.</t>

      <t>For convenience, a terse definition of most <xref
      target="RFC4593"></xref> terms is offered here. Those interested in a
      more thorough description of routing protocol threat sources,
      motivations, consequences and actions will want to read <xref
      target="RFC4593"></xref> before continuing here.</t>

      <section anchor="Threat_Sources" title="Threat Sources">
        <section anchor="outsiders" title="OUTSIDERS">
          <t>One of the threats that will be addressed in this roadmap are
          those where the source is an OUTSIDER. An OUTSIDER attacker may
          reside anywhere in the Internet, have the ability to send IP traffic
          to the router, may be able to observe the router's replies, and may
          even control the path for a legitimate peer's traffic. OUTSIDERS are
          not legitimate participants in the routing protocol. The use of
          message authentication and integrity protection specifically aims to
          identify packets originating from OUTSIDERS.</t>

          <t>KARP design teams will consider two specific use cases of
          OUTSIDERS: those on-path, and those off-path.</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>On-Path - These attackers have control of a network resource
              or a tap that sits along the path between two routing peers. A
              "Man-in-the-Middle" (MitM) is an on-path attacker. From this
              vantage point, the attacker can conduct either active or passive
              attacks. An active attack occurs when the attacker places
              packets on the network as part of the attack. One active MitM
              attack relevant to KARP, an active wiretapping attack, occurs
              when the attacker tampers with packets moving between two
              legitimate router peers in such a way that both peers think they
              are talking to each other directly, when in fact they are
              actually talking to the attacker. Protocols conforming to this
              roadmap will use cryptographic mechanisms to detect MitM attacks
              and reject packets from such attacks (i.e. discard them as being
              not authentic). Passive on-path attacks occur when the attacker
              silently gathers data and analyses it to gain advantage. Passive
              activity by an on-path attacker may lead to an active
              attack.</t>

              <t>Off-Path - These attackers sit on some network outside of
              that over which runs the packets between two routing peers. The
              source may be one or several hops away. Off-path attackers can
              launch active attacks, such as SPOOFING or denial-of-service
              (DoS) attacks, to name a few.</t>
            </list></t>

        <!-- end OUTSIDERS -->

        <section anchor="Unauthorized_Key_Holder"
                 title="Unauthorized Key Holder">
          <t>This threat source exists when an unauthorized entity somehow
          manages to gain access to keying material. Using this material, the
          attacker could send packets that pass the authenticity checks based
          on message authentication codes (MACs). The resulting traffic might
          appear to come from router A, destined to router B, and thus the
          attacker could impersonate an authorized peer. The attacker could
          then adversely affect network behavior by sending bogus messages
          that appear to be authentic. The attack source possessing the
          unauthorized keys could be on-path, off-path, or both.</t>

          <t>The obvious mitigation for an unauthorized key holder is to
          change the keys currently in use by the legitimate routing peers.
          This mitigation can be either reactive or pro-active. Reactive
          mitigation occurs when keys are changed only after one has
          discovered that the previous keys fell into the possession of
          unauthorized users. The reactive mitigation case is highlighted here
          in order to explain a common operational situation where new keying
          material will need to be put in place with little or no advanced
          warning. In such a case new keys must be able to be installed and
          put into use very quickly, and with little operational expense.
          Pro-active mitigation occurs when an operator assumes that
          unauthorized possession will occur from time to time without being
          discovered, and the operator moves to new keying material in order
          to cut short an attacker's window of opportunity to use the stolen
          keys effectively.</t>

          <t>KARP design teams can address this type of attack by creating
          specifications that make it practical for the operator to quickly
          change keys without disruption to the routing system, and with
          minimal operational overhead. Operators can further mitigate threats
          from unauthorized key holders by regularly changing keys.</t>

          <section anchor="Terminated_Employee" title="Terminated Employee">
            <t>A terminated employee is an important example of an
            "unauthorized key holder". Staff attrition is a reality in routing
            operations, and so regularly causes the potential for a threat
            source. The threat source risk arises when a network operator who
            had been granted access to keys ceases to be an employee. If new
            keys are deployed immediately, the situation of a terminated
            employee can become an "unauthorized key holder, pro-active" case,
            as described above, rather than an "unauthorized key holder,
            reactive mitigation" case. It behooves the operator to change the
            keys, to enforce the revocation of authorization of the old keys,
            in order to minimize the threat source's window of
            opportunity.</t>

            <t>A terminated employee is a valid unauthorized key holder threat
            source for KARP, and designs should address the associated
            threats. For example,new keys must be able to be installed and
            made operational in the routing protocols very quickly, with zero
            impact to the routing system, and with little operational expense.
            The threat actions associated with a terminated employee also
            motivate the need to roll the keys quickly, also with little
            operational expense.</t>

      <section anchor="inscope" title="Threat Actions In Scope">
        <t>These THREAT ACTIONS are in scope for KARP:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>SPOOFING - when an unauthorized device assumes the identity of
            an authorized one. Spoofing is special in that it can be used to
            carry out other threat actions causing other threat consequences.
            SPOOFING can be used, for example, to inject malicious routing
            information that causes the disruption of network services.
            SPOOFING can also be used to cause a neighbor relationship to form
            that subsequently denies the formation of the relationship with
            the legitimate router.</t>

            <t>DoS attacks <list style="numbers">
                <t>At the transport layer - This occurs when an attacker sends
                packets aimed at halting or preventing the underlying protocol
                over which the routing protocol runs. The attacker could use
                SPOOFING, FALSIFICATION and INTERFERENCE (see below) to
                produce the DoS attack. For example, BGP running over TLS will
                still not solve the problem of being able to send a spoofed
                TCP FIN or TCP RST and causing the BGP session to go down.
                Since this attack depends on spoofing, operators are
                encouraged to deploy proper authentication mechanisms to
                prevent such attacks. Specification work should ensure that
                Routing Protocols can operate over transport sub-systems in a
                fashion that is resilient to such DoS attacks.</t>

                <t>Using the authentication mechanism - This includes an
                attacker causing INTERFERENCE, which is inhibiting the
                exchanges of legitimate routers. The attack is often
                perpetrated by sending packets that confuse or overwhelm a
                security mechanism itself. An example is initiating an
                overwhelming load of spoofed routing protocol packets that
                contain a MAC (i.e, INSERTING MESSAGES), so that the receiver
                needs to spend the processing cycles to check the MAC, only to
                discard the spoofed packet, consuming substantial CPU
                resources. Other types of INTERFERENCE include: REPLAYING
                OUT-DATED PACKETS, CORRUPTING MESSAGES, and BREAKING
                SYNCHRONIZATION.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>FALSIFICATION - an action whereby an attacker sends false
            routing information. This document is only targeting FALSIFICATION
            from OUTSIDERS as may occur from tampering with packets in flight,
            or sending entirely false messages. FALSIFICATION from BYZANTINES
            (see the Threats Out of Scope section below) are not addressed by
            the KARP effort.</t>

            <t>Brute Force Attacks Against Password/Keys - This includes
            either online or offline attacks where attempts are made
            repeatedly using different keys/passwords until a match is found.
            While it is impossible to make brute force attacks on keys
            completely unsuccessful, proper design can make such attacks much
            harder to succeed. For example, current guidance for the security
            strength of an algorithm with a particular key length should be
            deemed acceptable for a period of 10 years. (Section 10 of <xref
            target="SP.800-131A"> </xref> is one source for guidance). Using
            per session keys is another widely used method for reducing the
            number of brute force attacks as this would make it difficult to
            guess the keys.</t>

      <section title="Threat Actions Out of Scope">
        <t>BYZANTINE sources -- be they faulty, misconfigured, or subverted --
        are out of scope for this roadmap. KARP works to cryptographically
        ensure that received routing messages originated from authorized
        peers, and that the message was not altered in transit. Formation of a
        bogus message by a valid and authorized peer falls outside the KARP
        scope. Any of the attacks described in the above section (<xref
        target="inscope"></xref>) that may be levied by a BYZANTINE source are
        therefore also out of scope, e.g. FALSIFICATION from BYZANTINE
        sources, or unauthorized message content by a legitimate authorized
        peer.</t>

        <t>In addition, these other attack actions are out of scope for this
        work:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>SNIFFING (passive wiretapping) - passive observation of route
            message contents in flight. Data confidentiality, as achieved by
            data encryption, is the common mechanism for preventing SNIFFING.
            While useful, especially to prevent the gathering of data needed
            to perform an off-path packet injection attack, data encryption is
            out-of-scope for KARP.</t>

            <t>INTERFERENCE due to: <list style="letters">
                <t>NOT FORWARDING PACKETS - cannot be prevented with
                cryptographic authentication. Note: If sequence numbers with
                sliding windows are used in the solution (as is done, for
                example, in BFD <xref target="RFC5880"> </xref>), a receiver
                can at least detect the occurrence of this attack.</t>

                <t>DELAYING MESSAGES - cannot be prevented with cryptographic
                authentication. Note: Timestamps can be used to detect
                delays.</t>

                unreachable by valid packets is NOT an attack that KARP will
                address. Many such examples could be contrived.</t>

    <section title="Requirements for KARP Work Phase 1, the Update to a Routing      Protocol's Existing Transport Security">
      <t>The KARP Design Guide <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref>, Section 4.1
      describes two distinct work phases for the KARP effort. This section
      addresses requirements for the first work phase only, "Work Phase 1",
      the update to a routing protocol's existing transport security. "Work
      Phase 2", a framework and usage of a KMP, will be addressed in a future
      document(s).</t>

      <t>The following list of requirements SHOULD be addressed by a KARP Work
      Phase 1 security update to any Routing Protocol (according to section
      4.1 of the KARP Design Guide <xref target="RFC6518"> </xref>document).
      IT IS RECOMMENDED that any Work Phase 1 security update to a Routing
      Protocol contain a section of the specification document that describes
      how each of the following requirements are met. It is further
      RECOMMENDED that justification be presented for any requirements that
      are NOT addressed.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Clear definitions of which elements of the transmitted data
          (frame, packet, segment, etc.) are protected by an
          authentication/integrity mechanism</t>

          <t>Strong cryptographic algorithms, as defined and accepted by the
          IETF security community, MUST be specified. The use of non-standard
          or unpublished algorithms MUST be avoided.</t>

          <t>Algorithm agility for the cryptographic algorithms used in the
          authentication MUST be specified, and protocol specifications MUST
          be clear how new algorithms are specified and used within the
          protocol. This requirement exists because research identifying
          weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms can cause the security
          community to reduce confidence in some algorithms. Breaking a cipher
          isn't a matter of if, but when it will occur. Having the ability to
          specify alternate algorithms (algorithm agility) within the protocol
          specification to support such an event is essential. Additionally,
          more than one algorithm MUST be specified. Mandating support for two
          algorithms (i.e., one mandatory to implement algorithm and one or
          more backup algorithms to guide transition) provides both
          redundancy, and a mechanism for enacting that redundancy.</t>

          <t>Secure use of PSKs, offering both operational convenience and a
          baseline level of security, MUST be specified.</t>

          <t>Routing Protocols (or the transport or network mechanism
          protecting routing protocols) SHOULD be able to detect and reject
          replayed intra-session and inter-session messages. Packets captured
          from one session MUST NOT be able to be re-sent and accepted during
          a later session (i.e., inter-session replay). Additionally, replay
          mechanisms MUST work correctly even in the presence of routing
          protocol packet prioritization by the router.<vspace
          blankLines="1" />There is a specific case of replay attack combined
          with spoofing that must be addressed. Several routing protocols
          (e.g., OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"></xref>, IS-IS <xref
          target="RFC1195"></xref>, BFD <xref target="RFC5880"></xref>, RIP
          <xref target="RFC2453"></xref>, etc.), require all speakers to share
          the same authentication and message association key on a broadcast
          segment. It is important that an integrity check associated with a
          message fail if an attacker has replayed the message with a
          different origin.</t>

          <t>A change of security parameters MUST force a change of session
          traffic keys. The specific security parameters for the various
          routing protocols will differ, and will be defined by each protocols
          design team. Some examples may include: master key, key lifetime,
          cryptographic algorithm, etc. If one of these configured parameters
          changes, then a new session traffic key MUST immediately be
          established using the updated parameters. The routing protocol
          security mechanisms MUST support this behavior.</t>

          <t>Security mechanisms MUST specify a means to affect intra-session
          re-keying without disrupting a routing session. This should be
          accomplished without data loss, if possible. Keys may need to be
          changed periodically based on policy, or when an administrator who
          had access to the keys leaves an organization. A re-keying mechanism
          enables the operators to execute the change without productivity
          loss.</t>

          <t>Re-keying SHOULD be supported in such a way that it can occur
          during a session without the peer needing to use multiple keys to
          validate a given packet. The rare exception will occur if a routing
          protocol's design team can find no other way to re-key and still
          adhere to the other requirements in this section. The specification
          SHOULD include a key identifier, which allows receivers to choose
          the correct key (or determine that they are not in possession of the
          correct key).</t>

          <t>New mechanisms MUST resist DoS attacks described as in-scope in
          <xref target="inscope"></xref>. Routers protect the control plane by
          implementing mechanisms to reject completely or rate limit traffic
          not required at the control plane level (i.e., unwanted traffic).
          Typically line rate packet filtering capabilities look at
          information at the IP and transport (TCP or UDP) headers, but do not
          include higher layer information. Therefore the new mechanisms
          shouldn't hide nor encrypt the information carried in the IP and
          transport layers in control plane packets.</t>

          <t>Mandatory cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms MUST be
          specified for each routing protocol security mechanism. Further, the
          protocol specification MUST define default security mechanism
          settings for all implementations to use when no explicit
          configuration is provided. To understand the need for this
          requirement, consider the case where a routing protocol mandates 3
          different cryptographic algorithms for a MAC operation. If company A
          implements algorithm 1 as the default for this protocol, while
          company B implements algorithm 2 as the default, then two operators
          who enable the security mechanism with no explicit configuration
          other than a PSK will experience a connection failure. It is not
          enough that each implementation implement the 3 mandatory
          algorithms; one default must further be specified in order to gain
          maximum out-of-the-box interoperability.</t>

          <t>For backward compatibility reasons, manual keying MUST be
          supported.</t>

          <t>The specification MUST consider and allow for future use of a
          KMP.</t>

          <t>The authentication mechanism in a Routing Protocol MUST be
          decoupled from the key management system used. The authentication
          protocol MUST include a specification for agreeing on keying
          material. This will accommodate both manual keying and the use of
          KMPs.</t>

          <t>Convergence times of the Routing Protocols SHOULD NOT be
          materially affected. Changes in the convergence time will be
          immediately and independently verifiable by convergence performance
          test beds already in use (e.g. those maintained by router vendors,
          service providers, and researchers). An increase in convergence time
          in excess of 5% is likely to be considered to have materially
          affected convergence by network operators. A number of other facts
          can also change convergence over time (e.g., speed of processors
          used on individual routing peers, processing power increases due to
          Moore's law, implementation specifics), and the effect of an
          authentication mechanism on Routing Protocols will need to take
          these into account by implementors. Protocol designers should
          consider the impact on convergence times as a function of both the
          total number of protocol packets that must be exchanged and the
          required computational processing of individual messages in the
          specification, understanding that the operator community's threshold
          for increase of convergence times is very low, as stated above.</t>

          <t>The changes to or addition of security mechanisms SHOULD NOT
          cause a refresh of route advertisements or cause additional route
          advertisements to be generated.</t>

          <t>Router implementations provide prioritized treatment for certain
          protocol packets. For example, OSPF HELLO packets and ACKs are
          prioritized for processing above other OSPF packets. The security
          mechanism SHOULD NOT interfere with the ability to observe and
          enforce such prioritization. Any effect on such priority mechanisms
          MUST be explicitly documented and justified. Replay protection
          mechanisms provided by the routing protocols MUST work even if
          certain protocol packets are offered prioritized treatment.</t>

          <t>The Routing Protocol MUST send minimal information regarding the
          authentication mechanisms and associated parameters in its protocol
          packets. This keeps the Routing Protocols as clean and focused as
          possible, and loads security negotiations into the KMP as much as
          possible. Another reason is to avoid exposing any security
          negotiation information unnecessarily to possible attackers on the
          path.</t>

          <t>Routing Protocols that rely on the IP header (or information
          separate from routing protocol payload) to identify the neighbor
          that originated the packet, MUST either protect the IP header or
          provide some other means to authenticate the neighbor. <xref
          target="RFC6039"></xref> describes some attacks that motivate this
          requirement.</t>

          <t>Every new KARP-developed security mechanisms MUST support
          incremental deployment. It will not be feasible to deploy a new
          Routing Protocol authentication mechanism throughout a network
          instantaneously. Indeed, it may not actually be feasible to deploy
          such a mechanism to all routers in a large autonomous system (AS) in
          a bounded timeframe. Proposed solutions MUST support an incremental
          deployment method that benefits those who participate. Because of
          this, there are several requirements that any proposed KARP
          mechanism should consider. <list style="letters">
              <t>The Routing Protocol security mechanism MUST enable each
              router to configure use of the security mechanism on a per- peer
              basis where the communication is peer-to-peer (unicast).</t>

              <t>Every new KARP-developed security mechanism MUST provide
              backward compatibility with respect to message formatting,
              transmission, and processing of routing information carried
              through a secure and non-secure security environment. Message
              formatting in a fully secured environment MAY be handled in a
              non-backward compatible fashion though care must be taken to
              ensure that routing protocol packets can traverse intermediate
              routers that don't support the new format.</t>

              <t>In an environment where both secured and non-secured routers
              are interoperating, a mechanism MUST exist for secured systems
              to identify whether a peer intended the messages to be
              secured.</t>

              <t>In an environment where secured service is in the process of
              being deployed, a mechanism MUST exist to support a transition
              free of service interruption (caused by the deployment per
              se).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The introduction of mechanisms to improve routing security may
          increase the processing performed by a router. Since most of the
          currently deployed routers do not have hardware to accelerate
          cryptographic operations, these operations could impose a
          significant processing burden under some circumstances. Thus
          proposed solutions SHOULD be evaluated carefully with regard to the
          processing burden they may impose, since deployment may be impeded
          if network operators perceive that a solution will impose a
          processing burden which either incurs substantial capital expense,
          or threatens to degrade router performance.</t>

          <t>New authentication and security mechanisms should not rely on
          systems external to the routing system (the equipment that is
          performing forwarding) in order for the routing system to be secure.
          In order to ensure the rapid initialization and/or return to service
          of failed nodes it is important to reduce reliance on these external
          systems to the greatest extent possible. Proposed solutions SHOULD
          NOT require connections to external systems, beyond those directly
          involved in peering relationships, in order to return to full
          service. It is however acceptable for the proposed solutions to
          require post initialization synchronization with external systems in
          order to fully synchronize security associations. <vspace
          blankLines="1" />If authentication and security mechanisms rely on
          systems external to the routing system, then there MUST be one or
          more options available to avoid circular dependencies. It is not
          acceptable to have a routing protocol (e.g., unicast routing) depend
          upon correct operation of a security protocol that, in turn, depends
          upon correct operation of the same instance of that routing protocol
          (i.e., the unicast routing). However, it is acceptable to have
          operation of a routing protocol (e.g., multicast routing) depend
          upon operation of a security protocol, which depends upon an
          independent routing protocol (e.g., unicast routing). Similarly it
          would be okay to have the operation of a routing protocol depend
          upon a security protocol, which in turn uses an out of band network
          to exchange information with remote systems.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document is mostly about security considerations for the KARP
      efforts, both threats and requirements for addressing those threats.
      More detailed security considerations were placed in the Security
      Considerations section of the KARP Design Guide <xref target="RFC6518">

      <t>The use of a group key between a set of Routing Protocol peers has
      special security considerations. Possession of the group key itself is
      used for identity validation, and no other identity check is used. Under
      these conditions an attack exists where one peer masquerades as a
      neighbor by using the neighbor's source IP address. This type of attack
      has been well documented in the group keying problem space, and it's
      non-trivial to solve. Solutions exist within the group keying realm, but
      they come with significant increases in complexity and computational
      intensity.</t>

                    Extended Message support for BGP
                draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-01

Abstract

   The BGP specification mandates a maximum BGP message size of 4096
   octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs, there is a
   need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This
   draft provides an extension to BGP to extend its current message size
   from 4096 octets to 65535 octets.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft      Extended Message support for BGP           June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The BGP specification [RFC4271] mandates a maximum BGP message size
   of 4096 octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs and
   newer capabilities (e.g., [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-overview]), there is
   a need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This
   draft provides an extension to BGP to extend its current message size
   from 4096 octets to 65535 octets.


2.  Extended message Capability for BGP

   To advertise BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP speaker
   uses BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC5492].  By advertising the
   BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys that
   it is able to send, receive, and properly handle BGP Extended
   Messages.

   A peer which does not advertise this capability MUST NOT send BGP
   Extended Messages, and BGP Extended Messages MUST NOT be sent to it.

   The BGP Extended Message Capability is a new BGP Capability [RFC5492]
   defined with Capability code TBD and Capability length 0.


3.  Operation

   A BGP speaker that is willing to send and receive BGP Extended
   Messages from its peer should advertise the BGP Extended Message
   Capability to its peer using BGP Capabilities Advertisement
   [RFC5492].  A BGP speaker may send extended messages to its peer only
   if it has received the Extended Message Capability from its peer.

   All BGP extended messages have maximum message size of 65535 octets.
   The smallest message that may be sent consists of a BGP header
   without a data portion (19 octets).  All multi-octet fields are in
   network byte order.

   Applications generating messages which might be encapsulated within
   BGP messages MUST limit the size of their payload to take into
   account the maximum message size and all encapsulation overheads on
   the path the encapsulated data are expected to traverse.


4.  Acknowledgements

   The authors thank John Scudder and John Levine for their input.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register a new BGP Capability Code in the
   upper range named BGP Extended Message Capability referring to this
   document.


6.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change BGP's underlying security
   issues.

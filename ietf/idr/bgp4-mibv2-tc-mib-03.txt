  Definitions of Textual Conventions for the Management of the Fourth
               Version of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4)
                  draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mibv2-tc-mib-03

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   which defines Textual Conventions for the management of BGP-4.  The
   intent is that these textual conventions will be used in BGP-related
   MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

Internet-Draft            BGP-4 MIB, Version 2                 July 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   which defines Textual Conventions for the management of BGP-4.  The
   intent is that these textual conventions will be used in BGP-related
   MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

   See the BGP-4 specification [RFC4271] and Multiprotocol Extensions
   for BGP-4 [RFC4760] for an introduction to the concepts these textual
   conventions cover.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other
   modules which use the BGP-4 protocol to define management objects.
   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign this MIB module an OID under mib-2.

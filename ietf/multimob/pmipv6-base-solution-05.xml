      <t>This document describes deployment options for activating multicast
      listener functions in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains without modifying
      mobility and multicast protocol standards. Similar to Home Agents in
      Mobile IPv6, Local Mobility Anchors of Proxy Mobile IPv6 serve as
      multicast subscription anchor points, while Mobile Access Gateways
      provide MLD proxy functions. In this scenario, Mobile Nodes remain
      agnostic of multicast mobility operations. A support for mobile
      multicast senders is outside the scope of this document.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> extends
      Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) <xref target="RFC3775"></xref> by network-based
      management functions that enable IP mobility for a host without
      requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling.
      Additional network entities called the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA), and
      Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs), are responsible for managing IP mobility
      on behalf of the mobile node (MN).</t>

      <t>With these entities in place, the mobile node experiences an
      exceptional access topology towards the static Internet in the sense
      that the MAG introduces a routing hop also in situations, were the LMA
      architecturally acts as the next hop (or designated) router for the MN.
      In the particular case of multicast communication, group membership
      management as signaled by the Multicast Listener Discovery protocol
      (MLD) <xref target="RFC3810"></xref>, <xref target="RFC2710"></xref>
      requires dedicated treatment at the network side .</t>

      <t>Multicast routing functions need to be placed carefully within the
      PMIPv6 domain to augment unicast transmission with group communication
      services. <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> does not explicitly address
      multicast communication. Bi-directional home tunneling, the minimal
      multicast support arranged by MIPv6, cannot be directly transferred to
      network-based management scenarios, since a mobility-unaware node will
      not initiate such a tunnel after movement. Consequently, even a minimal
      multicast listener support in PMIPv6 domains requires an explicit
      deployment of additional functions.</t>

      <t>This document describes options for deploying multicast listener
      functions in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains without modifying mobility and
      multicast protocol standards. Similar to Home Agents in Mobile IPv6,
      PMIPv6 Local Mobility Anchors serve as multicast subscription anchor
      points, while Mobile Access Gateways provide MLD proxy functions. Mobile
      Nodes in this scenario remain agnostic of multicast mobility operations.
      This document does not address specific optimizations and efficiency
      improvements of multicast routing for network-based mobility discussed
      in <xref target="RFC5757"></xref>, as such solutions would require
      changes to the base PMIPv6 protocol <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>. A
      support for mobile multicast senders is outside the scope of this
      document, as well.</t>

      <t>An MN in a PMIPv6 domain will decide on multicast group membership
      management completely independent of its current mobility conditions. It
      will submit MLD Report and Done messages, based on application triggers,
      using its link-local source address and multicast destination addresses
      according to <xref target="RFC3810"></xref>, or <xref target="RFC2710">
      </xref>. These link-local signaling messages will arrive at the
      currently active MAG via one of its downstream local (wireless) links. A
      multicast unaware MAG would simply discard these MLD messages.</t>

      <t>To facilitate multicast in a PMIPv6 domain, an MLD proxy function
      <xref target="RFC4605"></xref> needs to be deployed on the MAG that
      selects the tunnel interface corresponding to the MN's LMA for its
      upstream interface (cf., section 6 of <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>).
      Thereby, each MAG-to-LMA tunnel interface defines an MLD proxy domain at
      the MAG, and it contains all downstream links to MNs that share this
      specific LMA. According to standard proxy operations, MLD Report
      messages will be aggregated and then forwarded up the tunnel interface
      to its corresponding LMA.</t>

      <t>Serving as the designated multicast router or an additional MLD
      proxy, the LMA will transpose any MLD message from a MAG into the
      multicast routing infrastructure. Correspondingly, the LMA will create
      appropriate multicast forwarding states at its tunnel interface. Traffic
      of the subscribed groups will arrive at the LMA, and the LMA will
      forward this traffic according to its group/source states. In addition,
      the LMA will act as an MLD querier, seeing its downstream tunnel
      interfaces as multicast enabled links.</t>

      <t>At the MAG, MLD queries and multicast data will arrive on the
      (tunnel) interface that is assigned to a group of access links as
      identified by its Binding Update List (cf., section 6.1 of <xref
      target="RFC5213"></xref>). As specified for MLD proxies, the MAG will
      forward multicast traffic and initiate related signaling down the
      appropriate access links to the MNs. Hence all multicast-related
      signaling and the data traffic will transparently flow from the LMA to
      the MN on an LMA-specific tree, which is shared among the multicast
      sources.</t>

      <t>In case of a handover, the MN (unaware of IP mobility) will not send
      unsolicited MLD reports. Instead, the MAG is required to maintain group
      memberships in the following way. On observing a new MN on a downstream
      access link, the MAG sends a General MLD Query. Based on its outcome and
      the multicast group states previously maintained at the MAG, a
      corresponding Report will be sent to the LMA aggregating group
      membership states according to the proxy function. Additional Reports
      can be omitted when the previously established multicast forwarding
      states at the new MAG already cover the subscriptions of the MN.</t>

      <t>In summary, the following steps are executed on handover:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The MAG-MN link comes up and the MAG discovers the new MN.</t>

          <t>Unicast address configuration and PMIPv6 binding are performed
          after the MAG determines the corresponding LMA.</t>

          <t>Following IPv6 address configuration, the MAG SHOULD send an
          (early) MLD General Query to the new downstream link as part of its
          standard multicast-enabled router operations.</t>

          <t>The MAG SHOULD determine whether the MN is admissible to
          multicast services, and stop here otherwise.</t>

          <t>The MAG adds the new downstream link to the MLD proxy instance
          with up-link to the corresponding LMA.</t>

          <t>The corresponding Proxy instance triggers an MLD General Query on
          the new downstream link.</t>

          <t>The MN Membership Reports arrive at the MAG, either in response
          to the early Query or to that of the Proxy instance.</t>

          <t>The Proxy processes the MLD Report, updates states and reports
          upstream if necessary.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>After Re-Binding, the LMA is not required to issue a General MLD
      Query on the tunnel link to refresh forwarding states. Multicast state
      updates SHOULD be triggered by the MAG, which aggregates subscriptions
      of all its MNs (see the call flow in <xref
      target="fig:callflow"></xref>).</t>

      <t>These multicast deployment considerations likewise apply for mobile
      nodes that operate with their IPv4 stack enabled in a PMIPv6 domain.
      PMIPv6 can provide IPv4 home address mobility support <xref
      target="RFC5844"></xref>. Such mobile nodes will use IGMP <xref
      target="RFC2236"></xref>,<xref target="RFC3376"> </xref> signaling for
      multicast, which is handled by an IGMP proxy function at the MAG in an
      analogous way.</t>

      <t>Following these deployment steps, multicast management transparently
      inter-operates with PMIPv6. It is worth noting that MNs - while being
      attached to the same MAG, but associated with different LMAs - can
      subscribe to the same multicast group. Thereby data could be distributed
      redundantly in the network and duplicate traffic could arrive at a MAG.
      Additionally in a point-to-point wireless link model, a MAG might be
      forced to transmit the same data over one wireless domain to different
      MNs. However, multicast traffic arriving at one interface of the MN will
      always remain unique, i.e., the mobile multicast distribution system
      will never cause duplicate packets arriving at an MN (see <xref
      target="A-Eval"></xref> for further considerations).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Deployment Details">
      <t>Multicast activation in a PMIPv6 domain requires to deploy general
      multicast functions at PMIPv6 routers and to define their interaction
      with the PMIPv6 protocol in the following way:</t>

      <section title="Operations of the Mobile Node">
        <t>A Mobile Node willing to manage multicast traffic will join,
        maintain and leave groups as if located in the fixed Internet. No
        specific mobility actions nor implementations are required at the
        MN.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operations of the Mobile Access Gateway">
        <t>A Mobile Access Gateway is required to assist in MLD signaling and
        data forwarding between the MNs which it serves, and the corresponding
        LMAs associated to each MN. It therefore needs to implement an
        instance of the MLD proxy function <xref target="RFC4605"></xref> for
        each upstream tunnel interface that has been established with an LMA.
        The MAG decides on the mapping of downstream links to a proxy instance
        (and hence an upstream link to an LMA) based on the regular Binding
        Update List as maintained by PMIPv6 standard operations (cf., section
        6.1 of <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>). As links connecting MNs and
        MAGs change under mobility, MLD proxies at MAGs MUST be able to
        dynamically add and remove downstream interfaces in its
        configuration.</t>

        <t>On the reception of MLD reports from an MN, the MAG MUST identify
        the corresponding proxy instance from the incoming interface and
        perform regular MLD proxy operations: it will insert/update/remove
        multicast forwarding state on the incoming interface, and will merge
        state updates into the MLD proxy membership database. It will then
        send an aggregated Report via the upstream tunnel to the LMA when the
        membership database <xref target="RFC4605">(cf., section 4.1 of
        </xref>) changes. Conversely, on the reception of MLD Queries, the MAG
        proxy instance will answer the Queries on behalf of all active
        downstream receivers maintained in its membership database. Queries
        sent by the LMA do not force the MAG to trigger corresponding messages
        immediately towards MNs. Multicast traffic arriving at the MAG on an
        upstream interface will be forwarded according to the
        group/source-specific forwarding states as acquired for each
        downstream interface within the MLD proxy instance. At this stage, it
        is important to note that IGMP/MLD proxy implementations capable of
        multiple instances are expected to closely follow the specifications
        of section 4.2 in <xref target="RFC4605"></xref>, i.e., treat proxy
        instances in isolation of each other while forwarding. In providing
        isolated proxy instances, the MAG will uniquely serve its downstream
        links with exactly the data that belong to whatever group is
        subscribed on the particular interface.</t>

        <t>After a handover, the MAG will continue to manage upstream tunnels
        and downstream interfaces as specified in the PMIPv6 specification. It
        MUST dynamically associate new access links to proxy instances that
        include the upstream connection to the corresponding LMA. The MAG
        detects the arrival of a new MN by receiving a router solicitation
        message and by an upcoming link. To learn about multicast groups
        subscribed by a newly attaching MN, the MAG SHOULD send a General
        Query to the MN's link. Querying an upcoming interface is a standard
        operation of MLD queriers (see <xref target="A-InitMLD"></xref>) and
        is performed immediately after address configuration. In addition, an
        MLD query SHOULD be initiated by the proxy instance, as soon as a new
        interface has been configured for downstream. In case, the access link
        between MN and MAG goes down, interface-specific multicast states
        change. Both cases may alter the composition of the membership
        database and this will trigger corresponding Reports towards the LMA.
        Note that the actual observable state depends on the access link model
        in use.</t>

        <t>An MN may be unable to answer MAG multicast membership queries due
        to handover procedures, or its report may arrive before the MAG has
        configured its link as proxy downstream interface. Such occurrences
        are equivalent to a General Query loss. To prevent erroneous query
        timeouts at the MAG, MLD parameters SHOULD be carefully adjusted to
        the mobility regime. In particular, MLD timers and the Robustness
        Variable (see section 9 of <xref target="RFC3810"></xref>) MUST be
        chosen to be compliant with the time scale of handover operations and
        proxy configurations in the PMIPv6 domain.</t>

        <t>In proceeding this way, the MAG is able to aggregate multicast
        subscriptions for each of its MLD proxy instances. However, this
        deployment approach does not prevent multiple identical streams
        arriving from different LMA upstream interfaces. Furthermore, a
        multipoint channel forwarding into the wireless domain is prevented by
        the point-to-point link model in use.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operations of the Local Mobility Anchor">
        <t>For any MN, the Local Mobility Anchor acts as the persistent Home
        Agent and at the same time as the default multicast querier for the
        corresponding MAG. It implements the function of the designated
        multicast router or a further MLD proxy. According to MLD reports
        received from a MAG (on behalf of the MNs), it
        establishes/maintains/removes group/source-specific multicast
        forwarding states at its corresponding downstream tunnel interfaces.
        At the same time, it procures for aggregated multicast membership
        maintenance at its upstream interface. Based on the
        multicast-transparent operations of the MAGs, the LMA treats its
        tunnel interfaces as multicast enabled downstream links, serving zero
        to many listening nodes. Multicast traffic arriving at the LMA is
        transparently forwarded according to its multicast forwarding
        information base.</t>

        <t>After a handover, the LMA will receive Binding De-Registrations and
        Binding Lifetime Extensions that will cause a re-mapping of home
        network prefix(es) to a new Proxy-CoA in its Binding Cache (see
        section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>). The multicast
        forwarding states require updating, as well, if the MN within an MLD
        proxy domain is the only receiver of a multicast group. Two different
        cases need to be considered:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The mobile node is the only receiver of a group behind the
            interface at which a De-Registration was received: The membership
            database of the MAG changes, which will trigger a Report/Done sent
            via the MAG-to-LMA interface to remove this group. The LMA thus
            terminates multicast forwarding.</t>

            <t>The mobile node is the only receiver of a group behind the
            interface at which a Lifetime Extension was received: The
            membership database of the MAG changes, which will trigger a
            Report sent via the MAG-to-LMA interface to add this group. The
            LMA thus starts multicast distribution.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In proceeding this way, each LMA will provide transparent multicast
        support for the group of MNs it serves. It will perform traffic
        aggregation at the MN-group level and will assure that multicast data
        streams are uniquely forwarded per individual LMA-to-MAG tunnel.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv4 Support">
        <t>An MN in a PMIPv6 domain may use an IPv4 address transparently for
        communication as specified in <xref target="RFC5844"></xref>. For this
        purpose, LMAs can register IPv4-Proxy-CoAs in its Binding Caches and
        MAGs can provide IPv4 support in access networks. Correspondingly,
        multicast membership management will be performed by the MN using
        IGMP. For multicast support on the network side, an IGMP proxy
        function needs to be deployed at MAGs in exactly the same way as for
        IPv6. <xref target="RFC4605"></xref> defines IGMP proxy behaviour in
        full agreement with IPv6/MLD. Thus IPv4 support can be transparently
        provided following the obvious deployment analogy.</t>

        <t>For a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 access network, the MAG proxy instances
        SHOULD choose multicast signaling according to address configurations
        on the link, but MAY submit IGMP and MLD queries in parallel, if
        needed. It should further be noted that the infrastructure cannot
        identify two data streams as identical when distributed via an IPv4
        and IPv6 multicast group. Thus duplicate data may be forwarded on a
        heterogeneous network layer.</t>

        <t>A particular note is worth giving the scenario of <xref
        target="RFC5845"></xref> in which overlapping private address spaces
        of different operators can be hosted in a PMIP domain by using GRE
        encapsulation with key identification. This scenario implies that
        unicast communication in the MAG-LMA tunnel can be individually
        identified per MN by the GRE keys. This scenario still does not impose
        any special treatment of multicast communication for the following
        reasons.</t>

        <t>MLD/IGMP signaling between MNs and the MAG is on point-to-point
        links (identical to unicast). Aggregated MLD/IGMP signaling between
        the MAG proxy instance and the LMA remains link-local between the
        routers and independent of any individual MN. So the MAG-proxy and the
        LMA SHOULD not use GRE key identifiers, but plain GRE encapsulation to
        exchange MLD queries and reports. Similarly, multicast traffic sent
        from an LMA to MAGs proceeds as router-to-router forwarding according
        to the multicast forwarding information base (MFIB) of the LMA and
        independent of MN's unicast addresses, while the MAG proxy instance
        distributes multicast data down the point-to-point links (interfaces)
        according to its own MFIB, independent of MN's IP addresses.</t>

        <t>It remains an open issue how communication proceeds in a
        multi-operator scenario, i.e., from which network the LMA pulls
        multicast traffic. This could be any mobility Operator itself, or a
        third party. However, this backbone routing in general is out of scope
        of the document, and most likely a matter of contracts.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multihoming Support">
        <t>An MN can connect to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple interfaces
        and experience transparent unicast handovers at all interfaces (cf.,
        section 5.4 of <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>). In such simultaneous
        access scenario, it can autonomously assign multicast channel
        subscriptions to individual interfaces (see <xref
        target="RFC5757"></xref> for additional details). While doing so,
        multicast mobility operations described in this document will
        transparently preserve the association of channels to interfaces in
        the following way.</t>

        <t>Multicast listener states are kept per interface in the MLD state
        table. An MN will answer to an MLD General Query received on a
        specific (re-attaching) interface according to the specific
        interface's state table. Thereafter, multicast forwarding is resumed
        for channels identical to those under subscription prior to handover.
        Consequently, an MN in a PMIPv6 domain MAY use multiple interfaces to
        facilitate load balancing or redundancy, but cannot follow a
        'make-before-break' approach to service continuation on handovers.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multicast Availability throughout the Access Network">
        <t>There may be deployment scenarios, where multicast services are
        available throughout the access network independent of the PMIPv6
        infrastructure. Direct multicast access at MAGs may be supported
        through native multicast routing within a flat access network that
        includes a multicast router, via dedicated (tunnel or VPN) links
        between MAGs and designated multicast routers, or by deploying AMT
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Multicast deployment can be simplified in these scenarios. A single
        proxy instance at MAGs with up-link into the multicast cloud, for
        instance, could serve group communication purposes. MAGs could operate
        as general multicast routers or AMT gateways, as well.</t>

        <t>Common to these solutions is that mobility management is covered by
        the dynamics of multicast routing, as initially foreseen in the Remote
        Subscription approach sketched in <xref target="RFC3775"></xref>. Care
        must be taken to avoid avalanche problems or service disruptions due
        to tardy multicast routing operations, and to adapt to different
        link-layer technologies <xref target="RFC5757"></xref>. The different
        possible approaches should be carefully investigated beyond the
        initial sketch in <xref target="A-Eval"></xref>. Such work is beyond
        the scope of this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="A Note on Explicit Tracking">
        <t>An IGMPv3/MLDv2 Querier may operate in combination with explicit
        tracking as described in Appendix 2 of <xref target="RFC3376"></xref>,
        or Appendix 2 of<xref target="RFC3810"> </xref>. This mechanism allows
        routers to monitor each multicast receiver individually. Even though
        this procedure is not standardized yet, it is widely implemented by
        vendors as it supports faster leave latencies and reduced
        signaling.</t>

        <t>Enabling explicit tracking on downstream interfaces of the LMA and
        MAG would track a single MAG and MN respectively per interface. It may
        be used to preserve bandwidth on the MAG-MN link.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This draft does not introduce additional messages or novel protocol
      operations. Consequently, no new threats are introduced by this document

      target="RFC5213"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC5844"></xref>.</t>

      <t>However, particular attention should be paid to implications of
      combining multicast and mobility management at network entities. As this
      specification allows mobile nodes to initiate the creation of multicast
      forwarding states at MAGs and LMAs while changing attachments, threats
      of resource exhaustion at PMIP routers and access networks arrive from
      rapid state changes, as well as from high volume data streams routed
      into access networks of limited capacities. In addition to proper
      authorization checks of MNs, rate controls at replicators MAY be
      required to protect the agents and the downstream networks. In
      particular, MLD proxy implementations at MAGs SHOULD carefully procure
      for automatic multicast state extinction on the departure of MNs, as
      mobile multicast listeners in the PMIPv6 domain will not actively

    <section anchor="A-Eval"
             title="Comparative Evaluation of Different Approaches">
      <t>In this section, we briefly evaluate two basic PMIP concepts for
      multicast traffic organization at LMAs: In scenario A, multicast is
      provided by combined unicast/multicast LMAs as described in this
      document. Scenario B directs traffic via a dedicated multicast LMA as
      proposed in <xref target="I-D.zuniga-multimob-smspmip"></xref>, for
      example.</t>

      <t>Both approaches do not establish native multicast distribution
      between the LMA and MAG, but use tunneling mechanisms. In scenario A, a
      MAG is connected to different multicast-enabled LMAs, and can receive
      the same multicast stream via multiple paths depending on the group
      subscriptions of MNs and their associated LMAs. This problem, a.k.a.
      tunnel convergence problem, may lead to redundant traffic at the MAGs.
      Scenario B in contrast configures MAGs to establish a tunnel to a
      single, dedicated multicast LMA for all attached MNs and relocates
      overhead costs to the multicast anchor. This eliminates redundant
      traffic, but may result in an avalanche problem at the LMA.</t>

      <t>We quantify the costs of both approaches based on two metrics: The
      amount of redundant traffic at MAGs and the number of simultaneous
      streams at LMAs. Realistic values depend on the topology and the group
      subscription model. To explore scalability in a large PMIP domain of
      1,000,000 MNs, we consider the following two extremal multicast
      settings.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>All MNs participate in distinct multicast groups.</t>

          <t>All MNs join the same multicast groups.</t>
        </list>A typical PMIP deployment approximately allows for 5,000 MNs
      attached to one MAG, while 50 MAGs can be served by one LMA. Hence
      1,000,000 MNs require approx. 200 MAGs backed by 4 LMAs for unicast
      transmission. In scenario A, these LMAs also forward multicast streams,
      while in scenario B one additional dedicated LMA (LMA-M) serves
      multicast. In the following, we calculate the metrics described above.
      In addition, we display the number of packet streams that cross the
      interconnecting (wired) network within a PMIPv6 domain.</t>

      <t>These considerations of extremal settings show that tunnel
      convergence, i.e., duplicate data arriving at a MAG, does cause much
      smaller problems in scalability than the stream replication at LMAs
      (avalanche problem). For scenario A it should be also noted that the
      high stream replication requirements at LMAs in setting 1 can be
      attenuated by deploying additional LMAs in a PMIP domain, while scenario
      B does not allow for distributing the LMA-M, as no handover management
      is available at LMA-M.</t>

 Session Matching Update for the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
                draft-ietf-simple-msrp-sessmatch-07.txt

Abstract

   This document updates the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
   session matching procedure of MSRP endpoints.  The update extends the
   applicability of MSRP peer-to-peer communication to network scenarios
   where Application Layer Gateway (ALG) functions modify the Session
   Description Protcoll (SDP) MSRP address information.

   The update is backwards compatible.  In the absence of ALGs RFC 4975
   compliant MSRP User Agents (UAs) can interwork with MSRP UAs
   compliant with this specification.  In the presence of ALGs RFC 4975
   compliant MSRP UAs can normally not establish MSRP sessions.

1.  Introduction

   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] is designed to
   use MSRP relays [RFC4976] as a means for Network Address Translation
   (NAT) traversal and policy enforcement.

   However, many Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] networks,
   in which MSRP usage is emerging, also contain generic Application
   Layer Gateways (ALGs), which might control media relays and perform
   tasks such as NAT traversal, performance monitoring, lawful
   intercept, address domain bridging, interconnect Service Layer
   Agreement (SLA) policy enforcement, etc.  An example is the
   Interconnect Border Control Function (IBCF) [3GPP.23.228] defined by
   the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which controls a media
   relay that handles all types of SIP session media (voice, video,
   MSRP, etc).

   MSRP, as defined in RFC 4975 [RFC4975] and RFC 4976 [RFC4976], does
   not work when such ALGs are present between the SIP/MSRP endpoints,
   unless the ALGs act as MSRP Back-To-Back User Agents (B2BUAs).  The
   reason is that MSRP UAs, when they receive an MSRP message, use MSRP
   URI comparision [RFC4975] in order to match the MSRP message to an
   MSRP session.  That requires consistency between the address
   information the the MSRP messages and the MSRP URI carried in the SDP
   a=path attribute.  The matching will fail if an ALG modifies the
   address information of the SDP a=path attribute, but does not perform
   the corresponding modification in the MSRP message (which requires
   MSRP B2BUA functionaltiy).  However, few ALGs implement MSRP B2BUA
   functionality, due to complexity and poor scalability.

   In order to allow usage of MSRP use in SIP networks where ALGs are
   present, this document updates the session matching procedures
   defined in RFC 4975.  Instead of using the MSRP URI comparision
   procedure for matching an incoming MSRP message to an MSRP session,
   only the MSRP URI session-id part is used.

   The updated procedures defined in this specification allow the usage
   of non-MSRP B2BUA ALGs in MSRP peer-to-peer connections, with the
   restriction that TLS with name based authentication can not be used
   with such ALGs.  TLS with fingerprint based authentication can be
   used with such ALGs, however.  In case TLS name based authentication
   is used for peer-to-peer MSRP, or MSRP relays with or without TLS are
   used, ALGs still need to implement MSRP B2BUA functionality in order
   to prevent MSRP communication from failing.

   NOTE: Peer-to-peer MSRP, unprotected or TLS protected with
   fingerprint based TLS authentication, are considered to be the most
   common choises for MSRP communication in network environments where

Internet-Draft                    MRSP                    September 2010


   ALGs are deployed.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   In this specification the terminology "fingerprint based TLS
   authentication" and "name based TLS authentication" are used to refer
   to the two cases where:

   1 An endpoint use a self-signed TLS certificate and sends a
   certificate fingerprint in SDP (fingerprint based TLS
   authentication).

   2.  An endpoint use a certificate from a well known certificate
   authority and the other endpoint matches the hostname in the received
   TLS communication SubjectAltName parameter towards the hostname
   received in the MSRP URI in SDP (name based TLS authentication).


3.  Applicability statement

   This document updates sections 5.4 (MSRP Connection Model) and 7.3
   (Receiving Requests) of [RFC4975].  An MSRP UA MUST implement the
   procedures defined in this document in order to interoperate with
   remote MSRP UAs in a network where intermediaries might modify the
   address information in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute.


4.  Normative update of RFC 4975

4.1.  General

   This section replaces the text for the 5th and 10th paragraph of
   section 5.4 (MSRP Connection Model), the 6th paragraph of section 6
   (MSRP URIs), the 1st section of section 6.1 (MSRP URI Comparison) and
   the first paragraph of section 7.3 (Receiving Requests), of RFC 4975.

4.2.  RFC4975: 5.4 MSRP Connection Model

4.2.1.  5th paragraph

   The rules on certificate name matching and CA signing MAY be relaxed
   when using TLS peer-to-peer.  In this case, a mechanism to ensure

Internet-Draft                    MRSP                    September 2010


   that the peer used a correct certificate MUST be used.  See Section
   14.4 for details.  It is strongly RECOMMENDED that MSRP endpoints,
   when using peer-to-peer MSRP with TLS, use the mechanism described in
   section 14.4, in order to be able to establish MSRP sessions in
   networks where Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) are deployed.

4.2.2.  10th paragraph

   When the first request arrives, its To-Path header field should
   contain a URI with a session-id part that the listening element
   provided in the SDP for a session.  The element that accepted the
   connection looks up the session-id part of the URI in the received
   request, and determines which session it matches.  If a match exists,
   the node MUST assume that the host that formed the connection is the
   host to which this URI was given.  If no match exists, the node MUST
   reject the request with a 481 response.  The node MUST also check to
   make sure the session is not already in use on another connection.
   If the session is already in use, it MUST reject the request with a
   506 response.

4.3.  RFC4975: 6. MSRP URIs

4.3.1.  6th paragraph

   The MSRP URI authority field identifies a particular MSRP host
   device.  If the authority field contains a numeric IP address, it
   MUST also contain a port.  The MSRP URI session-id field identifies a
   particular session at the host device, and a particular value of
   session-id is only meaningful in the context of the particular MSRP
   host device that created it.  An MSRP URI that does not include a
   session-id is a reference to an MSRP host device, not to any
   particular session at that device.

4.4.  RFC4975: 6.1 MSRP URI Comparison

4.4.1.  1st paragraph

   In the context of the MSRP protocol, MSRP URI comparisons MUST be
   performed according to the following rules:

   1.  The scheme MUST match.  Scheme comparison is case insensitive.

   2.  If the authority component contains an explicit IP address and/or
   port, these are compared for address and port equivalence.  Percent-
   encoding normalization [10] applies; that is, if any percent-encoded
   non-reserved characters exist in the authority component, they must
   be decoded prior to comparison.  Userinfo parts are not considered
   for URI comparison.  Otherwise, the authority component is compared

Internet-Draft                    MRSP                    September 2010


   as a case-insensitive character string.

   3.  If the port exists explicitly in either URI, then it MUST match
   exactly.  A URI with an explicit port is never equivalent to another
   with no port specified.

   4.  The session-id part is compared as case sensitive.  A URI without
   a session-id part is never equivalent to one that includes one.

   5.  URIs with different "transport" parameters never match.  Two URIs
   that are identical except for transport are not equivalent.  The
   transport parameter is case insensitive.

   Path normalization [10] is not relevant for MSRP URIs.

   This specification does not define any usage for the MSRP URI
   comparison rules.  However, if an extension mechanism requires MSRP
   URI comparison, it MUST use the rules defined in this section.

   NOTE: The MSRP URI comparison rules are not used to match MSRP
   messages with MSRP sessions.  As defined in Section 4.5, only the
   MSRP URI session-id part is used for the session matching.

4.5.  RFC4975: 7.3 Receiving Requests

4.5.1.  1st paragraph

   The receiving endpoint MUST first check the URI in the To-Path to
   make sure the request belongs to an existing session.  When the
   request is received, the To-Path will have exactly one URI, of which
   the session-id part MUST map to an existing session that is
   associated with the connection on which the request arrived.  The
   session-id part is compared as case sensitive.  If this is not true,
   then the receiver MUST generate a 481 error and ignore the request.
   Note that if the Failure-Report header field had a value of "no",
   then no error report would be sent.


5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  MSRP URI as shared secret

   An MSRP UA compliant to RFC 4975 uses the complete MSRP URI (scheme,
   authority, transport, session-id) as a shared secret in order to
   determine that an incoming transport connection originates from the
   intended peer device.  The shared secret needs to be hard to guess,
   but in reality only the session-id part with it's minimum 80 bit of
   randomness that is hard to guess.  Using only the MSRP URI session-id

Internet-Draft                    MRSP                    September 2010


   part as shared secret is therfore roughly as good as using the
   complete URI.

5.2.  Uniqueness of the session-id

   An MSRP URI session-id value only needs to be unique within the scope
   of the MSRP device that created it, so in order to make the
   session-id unique there is no need to scope its namespace by the MSRP
   URI authority part.

5.3.  Man in the middle

   In order for a device to insert itself as a man in the middle in the
   MSRP communication path, it needs to be in the SIP/SDP signalling
   path and modify the SDP MSRP URI information associated with the MSRP
   session.  When communicating with RFC 4975 compliant MSRP UAs, such
   device also needs to implement MSRP B2BUA functionality, since it
   needs to modify the MSRP To-Path and From-Path header fields, in
   order to match the SDP modification.  This insertion of a man in the
   middle might not be detected by MSRP end devices.

   Due to the update in this specification a man in the middle no longer
   need to implement an MSRP B2BUA in order to be transparently in the
   MSRP communication path.  However, a man in the middle that does not
   implement MSRP B2BUA functionality, and does not locally terminate
   the TCP/MSRP connection, has very limited impact on the MSRP
   connection.  It could potentially monitor unprotected MSRP
   communication, but any kind of flexible fraudulent endpoint
   transparent modification of the MSRP communication is likely much
   easier done by using MSRP B2BUA functionality.

5.4.  TLS

   This specification does not in any way modify the TLS security
   procedures for MSRP.

   TLS with fingerprint based authentication is not affected by the
   presence of intermediaries that modify the SDP MSRP URI information.
   TLS with name based authentication can only be used in presence of
   ALGs if these implement MSRP B2BUA functionality.  Otherwise TLS
   authentication will fail.  That applies to MSRP in general, and is
   not specific to the updates defined in this specification.

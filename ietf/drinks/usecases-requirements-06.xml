			<xref target="RFC5486"/> (Section 3.3) defines Session Establishment Data, or SED, as the data used to route a call to the next hop associated with the called domain's ingress point. More specifically, the SED is the set of parameters that the outgoing signaling path border elements (SBEs) need to establish a session. However, <xref target="RFC5486"/> does not specify the protocol(s) or format(s) to provision SED. To pave the way to specify such a protocol, this document presents the use cases and associated requirements that have been proposed to provision SED data.

			<vspace blankLines='1' />

			SED is typically created by the terminating or next-hop SSP and consumed by the originating SSP. To avoid a multitude of bilateral exchanges, SED is often shared via intermediary systems - termed registries within this document. Such registries receive data via provisioning transactions from SSPs, and then distribute the received data into Local Data Repositories (LDRs). These LDRs are used for call routing by outgoing SBEs.  This is depicted in <xref target="GeneralOverview"/>.

			In this document, we address the use cases and requirements for provisioning registries. Data distribution to local data repositories is out of scope for this document. The resulting provisioning protocol can be used to provision data into a registry, or between multiple registries operating in parallel. In <xref target="FunctionalOverview"/>, the case of multiple registries is depicted with dotted lines.

			This Section documents use cases related to the provisioning of the registry. Any request to provision, modify or delete data is subject to several security considerations (see Section <xref target="security"/>). This document does not address these considerations.

						<list style='format UC PROV #%d'>
							<t hangText="">
Real-Time Provisioning:  Registrars have operational systems that provision public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs), in association with their SED.  These systems often function in a manner that expect or require that these provisioning activities be completed immediately, as apposed to an out-of-band or batch provisioning scheme that can occur at a later time.  This type of provisioning is referred to as real-time, or on-demand provisioning.  
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Non-Real-Time Bulk Provisioning:  Operational systems that provision public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs) and associated SED sometimes expect that these provisioning activities be batched up into large sets.  These batched requests are then processed using a provisioning mechanism that is out-of-band and occurs at a later time. 
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Multi-Request Provisioning:  Regardless of whether a provisioning action is performed in real-time or not, SSPs often perform several provisioning actions on several objects in a single request or transaction.  This is done for performance and scalability reasons, and for transactional reasons, such that the set of provisioning actions either fail or succeed atomically, as a complete set.

Inter-SSP SED:  SSPs create peering relationships with other SSPs in order to establish interconnects.  Establishing these interconnects involves, among other things, communicating and enabling the points of ingress and other SED used to establish sessions.
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Direct and Indirect Peering:  Some inter-SSP peering relationships are created to enable the establishment of sessions to the public identifiers for which an SSP is the carrier-of-record.  This is referred to as direct peering.  Other inter-SSP peering relationships are created to enable the establishment of sessions to public identifiers for which an SSP is a transit provider.  This is referred to as indirect peering.  Some SSPs take into consideration an SSP’s role as a transit or carrier-of-record provider when selecting a route to a public identifier.  
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Intra-SSP SED:  SSPs support the establishment of sessions between their own public identifiers, not just to other SSPs' public identifiers.  Enabling this involves, among other things, communicating and enabling intra-SSP signaling points and other SED that can differ from inter-SSP signaling points and SED.  
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Selective Peering (a.k.a. per peer policies):  SSPs create peering relationships with other SSPs in order to establish interconnects.  However, SSPs peering relationships often result in different points of ingress or other SED for the same set of public identifiers. This is referred to as selective peering, and is done on a route group basis.
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Provisioning of a delegated hierarchy: An SSP may decide to maintain its own infrastructure to contain the route records that constitute the terminal step in the LUF. In such cases, the SSP will provision registries to direct queries for the SSP's public identifiers to its own infrastructure, rather than provisioning the route records directly. For example, in the case of DNS-based route records, such a delegated hierarchy would make use of NS and CNAME records, while a flat structure would make use of NAPTR resource records.

<!-- Provisioning of a delegated name server: An SSP maintains a Tier 2 name server that contains the NAPTR records that constitute the terminal step in the LUF.  The SSP needs to provision a registry to direct queries for the SSP's numbers to the Tier 2 name server.  Usually queries to the registry should return NS records, but in cases where the Tier 2 uses a different domain suffix from that used in the registry, CNAME and NS records may be employed instead.  -->

							<t hangText="">
SED Exchange and Discovery using LUF’s Domain Name:  When establishing peering relationships some SSPs may not wish to communicate or receive points of ingress and other SED using a registry.

Separation of Provisioning Responsibility: An SSP's operational practices often separate the responsibility of provisioning the points of ingress and other SED, from the responsibility of provisioning public identifiers (or TN ranges or RNs).  For example, a network engineer can establish a physical interconnect with a peering SSP's network and provision the associated domain name, host, and IP addressing information.  Separately, for each new subscriber, the SSP's provisioning systems provision the associated public identifiers. 
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Destination Groups:  SSPs often provision identical SED for large numbers of public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs).  For reasons of efficiency, groups of public identifiers that have the same SED can be aggregated. These aggregations are known as destination groups. The SED is then indirectly associated with destination groups rather than with each individual public identifier (or TN Ranges or RNs).
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Route Groups:  SSPs often provision identical SED for large numbers of public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs), and then expose that relationship between a group of SED records and a group of public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs) to one or more SSPs.  This combined grouping of SED records and destination groups facilitates efficient management of relationships and the list of peers (data recipients) that can lookup public identifiers and receive the associated SED.  This dual set of SED Records and destination groups is termed as a route group.

							<t hangText="">
							Additions and deletions: SSPs often allocate and de-allocate specific public identifiers to and from end-users. This involves, among other things, activating or deactivating specific public identifiers (TN ranges or RNs), and directly or indirectly associating them with the appropriate points of ingress and other SED.
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Carrier-of-Record vs Transit Provisioning:  Some inter-SSP peering relationships are created to enable the establishment of sessions to the public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs)  for which an SSP is the carrier-of-record.  Other inter-SSP peering relationships are created to enable the establishment of sessions for which an SSP is a transit provider.  Some SSPs take into consideration an SSP’s role as a transit or carrier-of-record provider when selecting a route.
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Multiplicity:  As described in previous use cases, SSPs provision public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs) and their associated SED for multiple peering SSPs, and as both the carrier-of-record and transit provider.  As a result, a given public identifier (or TN Range or RN) key can reside in multiple destination groups at any given time.  
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Destination Group Modification:  SSPs often change the SED associated with a given public identifier (or TN Range or RN). This involves, among other things, directly or indirectly associating them with a different point of ingress, different services, or different SED.  
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Carrier-Of-Record vs Transit Modification:  SSPs may have the need to change their Carrier-Of-Record vs Transit role for public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs) that they previously provisioned.  
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Modification of authority: An SSP indicates that it is the carrier-of-record for an existing public identifier or TN Range.  If the public identifier or TN Range was previously associated with a different carrier-of-record then there are multiple possible outcomes, such as: a) the previous carrier-of-record is disassociated, b) the previous carrier-of-record is relegated to transit status, or c) the new carrier-of-record is placed in inactive mode.  The choice may be dependent on the deployment scenario, and is out of scope for this document.

						<list style='format UC MISC #%d'>
							<t hangText="">
							Number Portability: The SSP wishes to provide, in query response to public identifiers, an associated routing number (RN). This is the case where a set of public identifiers is no longer associated with original SSP but have been ported to a recipient SSP, who provides access to these identifiers via a switch on the Signaling System Number 7 network identified by the RN.
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>

							<t hangText="">
Data Recipient Offer and Accept: When a peering relationship is established (or invalidated) SSPs provision (or remove) data recipients in the registry. However, a peer may first need to accept it's role (as a data recipient) before such a change is made effective. Alternatively an auto-accept feature can be configured for a given data recipient.
							<vspace blankLines='2' />
							</t>


							<t hangText="">
Open numbering plans: In several countries, an open numbering plan is used, where the carrier-of-record is only aware of a portion of the E.164 number (i.e., the TN prefix). The carrier-of-record may not know the complete number, or the number of digits in the number. The rest of the digits are handled offline (e.g., by a Private Branch Exchange, or PBX).  For example, an SSP can be the carrier-of-record for "+123456789", and is also the carrier-of-record for every possible expansion of that number such as "+12345678901" and "+123456789012", even though the SSP does not know what those expansions could be.  This can be described as the carrier-of-record effectively being authoritative for the TN prefix.

				The following functional requirements apply:
				<list style='format FREQ%d:'>
					<t hangText="">
					The registry provisioning interface MUST support the creation and deletion of: public identifiers, destination groups, route groups and data recipient groups. 
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
					</t>
					<t hangText="">
					The registry provisioning interface MUST support near-real-time, non-real-time and deferred provisioning operations.
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
					</t>

					<t hangText="">
					The registry provisioning interface MUST support the following types of modifications:
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
					-  reassignment of one or more public identifiers from one destination group to another;
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
					-  reassignment of one data recipient from one destination group to another;
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
					-  association and disassociation of a "Default Route Group" with a Data Recipient; and,
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
					-  identification of a destination group as a "Carrier of Record" (COR) destination group or a "Transit" destination group.
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
						
					</t>

					<t>

					When an entity with a different client identifier than that of the carrier of record for a public identity in a destination group adds a new SSP to a destination recipient group associated with that destination group, the registry provisioning interface MUST: a) notify the new SSP of the updated routing information (which constitutes a peering offer) b) not provision the SED to the new SSP's LDR unless the new SSP signals acceptance.
					</t>

					<t>
					The registry provisioning interface MUST separate the provisioning of the routing information from the associated identifiers.
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
					</t>

					<t>
					The registry provisioning protocol MUST define a discrete set of response codes for each supported protocol operation.  Each response code MUST definitively indicate whether the operation succeeded or failed.  If the operation failed, the response code MUST indicate the reason for the failure.
					<vspace blankLines='1' />

					<t>
					The registry provisioning interface MUST allow an SSP to define multiple sub-identifiers that can be used in data recipient groups
					</t>

					<t>
					The registry provisioning interface MUST define the concurrency rules, locking rules, and race conditions that underlie the implementation of that protocol operation and that result from the coexistence of protocol operations that can operate on multiple objects in a single operation and bulk file operations that may process for an extended period of time.
					<vspace blankLines='1' />

					<t>
					The registry provisioning interface MUST support the ability for a Data Recipient to optionally define a Route Group as their Default Route Group, such that if the Data Recipient performs a resolution request and the lookup key being resolved is not found in the Destination Groups visible to that Data Recipient then the SED Records associated with the Default Route Group shall be returned in the resolution response.
						
					</t>

					<t>
					The registry provisioning interface MUST support the ability for the owner of a Route Group to optionally define Source Based Routing Criteria to be associated with their Route Group(s).  The Source Based Routing Criteria will include the ability to specify zero or more of the following in association with a given Route Group:  Resolution Client IP Address(es) or Domain Names, Calling Party URI(s).  The result will be that the resolution server would evaluate the characteristics of the Source, compare them against Source Based Routing Criteria associated with the Route Groups visible to that Data Recipient, and return any SED Records associated with the matching Route Groups.
					</t>

					<t>
					The registry provisioning interface MUST track, via a client identifier, the entity provisioning each data object (e.g. Destination Group or Route Group ). This client identifier will identify the entity that is responsible for that data object from a protocol interface perspective. This client identifier SHOULD be tied to the session authentication credentials that the client uses to connect into to the registry.
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
					The registry provisioning interface MUST incorporate a data recipient identifier that identifies the organization responsible for each data object from a business perspective. This organization identifier may or may not ultimately refer to the same organization that the client Identifier refers to. The separation of the data recipient identifier from the client identifier will allow for the separation of the two entities, when the need arises.

Exactly one client identifier MUST be allowed to provision objects under a given data recipient identifier.  But a client identifier MUST be allowed to provision objects under multiple data recipient identifiers.
					<vspace blankLines='1' />
Objects provisioned under one "Protocol Client Identifier" MUST NOT be alterable by a provisioning session established by another "Protocol Client Identifier".

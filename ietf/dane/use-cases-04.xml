    <abstract>
      <t>Many current applications use the certificate-based authentication
      features in TLS to allow clients to verify that a connected server
      properly represents a desired domain name. Traditionally, this
      authentication has been based on PKIX trust hierarchies, rooted in
      well-known CAs, but additional information can be provided via the DNS
      itself. This document describes a set of use cases in which the DNS and
      DNSSEC could be used to make assertions that support the TLS
      authentication process.</t>

    <section anchor="intro-sec" title="Introduction">
      <t>Transport-Layer Security (TLS) is used as the basis for security
      features in many modern Internet application service protocols to
      provide secure client-server connections <xref target="RFC5246"></xref>.
      It underlies secure HTTP and secure email <xref
      target="RFC2818"></xref><xref target="RFC2595"></xref><xref
      target="RFC3207"></xref>, and provides hop-by-hop security in real-time
      multimedia and instant-messaging protocols <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref><xref target="RFC6120"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Application service clients typically establish TLS connections to
      application servers identified by DNS domain names. The process of
      obtaining this "source" domain is application specific. The name could
      be entered by a user or found through an automated discovery process
      such as an SRV or NAPTR record. After obtaining the address of the
      server via an A or AAAA DNS record, the client conducts a TLS handshake
      with the server, during which the server presents a PKIX certificate
      <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>. The TLS layer performs PKIX validation
      of the certificate, including verification that the certificate chains
      to a trust anchor. If this validation is successful, then the
      application layer determines whether the DNS name for the application
      service presented in the certificate matches the source domain name
      <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>. Typically, if the name matches, then the
      client proceeds with the TLS connection.</t>

      <t>The certificate authorities (CAs) that issue PKIX certificates are
      asserting bindings between domain names and the public keys they
      certify. Application service clients are verifying these bindings and
      making authorization decisions -- whether to proceed with connections --
      based on them.</t>

      <t>Clients thus rely on CAs to correctly assert bindings between public
      keys and domain names, in the sense that the holder of the corresponding
      private key should be the domain holder. Today, an attacker can
      successfully authenticate as a given application service domain if he
      can obtain a "mis-issued" ciertificate from one of the widely-used CAs
      -- a certificate containing the victim application service's domain name
      and a public key whose corresponding private key is held by the
      attacker. If the attacker can additionally insert himself as a man in
      the middle between an client and server (e.g., through DNS cache
      poisoning of an A or AAAA record), then the attacker can convince the
      client that a server of the attacker's choice legitimately represents
      the victim's application service.</t>

      <t>With the advent of DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"></xref>, it is now
      possible for DNS name resolution to provide its information securely, in
      the sense that clients can verify that DNS information was provided by
      the domain holder and not tampered with in transit. The goal of
      technologies for DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is to
      use the DNS and DNSSEC to provide additional information about the
      cryptographic credentials associated with a domain, so that clients can
      use this information to increase the level of assurance they receive
      from the TLS handshake process. This document describes a set of use
      cases that capture specific goals for using the DNS in this way, and a
      set of requirements that the ultimate DANE mechanism should satisfy.</t>

      <t>Finally, it should be noted that although this document will
      frequently use HTTPS as an example application service, DANE is intended
      to apply equally to all applications that make use of TLS to connect to
      application services named by domain names.</t>

      -->

      <t>This document also makes use of standard PKIX, DNSSEC, and TLS
      terminology. See RFC 5280 <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>, RFC 4033 <xref
      target="RFC4033"></xref>, and RFC 5246 <xref target="RFC5246"></xref>,
      respectively, for these terms. In addition, terms related to
      TLS-protected application services and DNS names are taken from RFC 6125
      <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Note in particular that the term "server" in this document refers to
      the server role in TLS, rather than to a host. Multiple servers of this
      type may be co-located on a single physical host, using different ports,
      and each of these can use different certificates.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="lock-sec" title="Use Cases">
      <t>In this section, we describe the major use cases that the DANE
      mechanism should support. This list is not intended to represent all
      possible ways that the DNS can be used to support TLS authentication.
      Rather it represents the specific cases that comprise the initial goal
      for DANE.</t>

      <t>In the below use cases, we will refer to the following dramatis
      personae:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Alice:">The operator of a TLS-protected application
          service on the host alice.example.com, and administrator of the
          corresponding DNS zone.</t>

          <t hangText="Bob:">A client connecting to alice.example.com</t>

          <t hangText="Charlie:">A well-known CA that issues certificates with
          domain names as identifiers</t>

          <t hangText="Oscar:">An outsourcing provider that operates
          TLS-protected application services on behalf of customers</t>

          <t hangText="Trent:">A CA that issues certificates with domain names
          as identifiers, but is not generally well-known.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>These use cases are framed in terms of adding verification steps to
      TLS server identity checking on the part of application service clients.
      In application services where the clients are also identified by domain
      names (e.g., XMPP server-to-server connections), the same considerations
      and use cases can applied to the application server's checking of
      identities in TLS client certificates.</t>

      <section anchor="ca-cons" title="CA Constraints">
        <t>Alice runs a website on alice.example.com and has obtained a
        certificate from the well-known CA Charlie. She is concerned that
        other well-known CAs might issue certificates for alice.example.com
        without her authorization, which clients would accept. Alice would
        like to provide a mechanism for visitors to her site to know that they
        should expect alice.example.com to use a certificate issued under the
        CA that she uses (Charlie) and not another CA. That is, Alice is
        recommending that the client verify that there is a valid certificate
        chain from the server certificate to Charlie before accepting the
        server certificate. (For example, in the TLS handshake, the server
        might include Charlie's certificate in the server Certificate
        message's certificate_list structure <xref
        target="RFC5246"></xref>).</t>

        <t>When Bob connects to alice.example.com, he uses this mechanism to
        verify that that the certificate presented by the server was issued
        under the proper CA, Charlie. Bob also performs the normal PKIX
        validation procedure for this certificate, in particular verifying
        that the certificate chains to a trust anchor (possibly Charlie's CA,
        if Bob accepts Charlie's CA as a trust anchor).</t>

        <t>Alice may wish to provide similar information to an external CA
        operator Charlie. Prior to issuing a certificate for alice.example.com
        to someone claiming to Alice, Charlie needs to verify that Alice is
        actually requesting a certificate. Alice could indicate her preferred
        CA using DANE to CAs as well as RPs. Charlie could then check to see
        whether Alice said that her certificates should be issued by Charlie
        or another CA. Note that this check does not guarantee that the
        precise entity requesting a certification from Charlie actually
        represents Alice, only that Alice has authorized Charlie to issue
        certificates for her domain to properly authorized individuals.</t>

        <t>In principle, DANE information expressing CA constraints can be
        presented with or without DNSSEC protection. Presenting DANE
        information without DNSSEC protection does not introduce any new
        vulnerabilities, but neither does it add much assurance. Deletion of
        records removes the protection provided by this constraint, but the
        client is still protected by CA practices (as now). Injected or
        modified false records are not useful unless the attacker can also
        obtain a certificate for the target domain. Thus, In the worst case,
        tampering with these constraints increases the risk of false
        authentication to the level that is now standard.</t>

        <t>Using DANE information for CA constraints without DNSSEC provides a
        very small incremental security feature. Many common attacks against
        TLS connections already require the attacker to inject false A or AAAA
        records in order to steer the victim client to the attacker's server.
        An attacker that can already inject false DNS records can also provide
        fake DANE information (without DNSSEC) by simply spoofing the
        additional records required to carry the DANE information.</t>

        <t>Injected or modified false DANE information of this type can be
        used for denial of service, even if the attacker does not have a
        certificate for the target domain. If an attacker can modify DNS
        responses that a target host receives, however, there are already much
        simpler ways of denying service, such as providing a false A or AAAA
        record. In this case, DNSSEC is not helpful, since an attacker could
        still case a denial of service by blocking all DNS responses for the
        target domain.</t>

        <t>Continuing to require PKIX validation also limits the degree to
        which DNS operators (as distinct from the holders of domains) can
        interfere with TLS authentication through this mechanism. As above,
        even if a DNS operator falsifies DANE records, it cannot masquerade as
        the target server unless it can also obtain a certificate for the
        target domain.</t>

      <section anchor="cert-cons" title="Service Certificate Constraints">
        <t>Alice runs a website on alice.example.com and has obtained a
        certificate from the well-known CA Charlie. She is concerned about
        additional, unauthorized certificates being issued by Charlie as well
        as by other CAs. She would like to provide a way for visitors to her
        site to know that they should expect alice.example.com to present a
        specific certificate. In TLS terms, Alice is letting Bob know that
        this specific certificate must be the first certificate in the server
        Certificate message's certificate_list structure <xref
        target="RFC5246"></xref>.</t>

        <t>When Bob connects to alice.example.com, he uses this mechanism to
        verify that that the certificate presented by the server is the
        correct certificate. Bob also performs the normal PKIX validation
        procedure for this certificate, in particular verifying that the
        certificate chains to a trust anchor.</t>

        <t>The security implications for this case are the same as for the "CA
        Constraints" case above.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="dom-iss"
               title="Trust Anchor Assertion and Domain-Issued Certificates">
        <t>Alice would like to be able to generate and use certificates for
        her website on alice.example.com without involving an external CA at
        all. Alice can generate her own certificates today, making self-signed
        certificates and possibly certificates subordinate to those
        certificates. When Bob receives such a certificate in a TLS handshake,
        however, he doesn't automatically have a way to verify that the issuer
        of the certificate is actually Alice, because he doesn't necessarily
        possess Alice's corresponding trust anchor. This concerns him because
        an attacker could present a different certificate and perform a man in
        the middle attack. Bob would like to protect against this.</t>

        <t>Alice would thus like to have a mechanism for visitors to her site
        to know that the certificates presented by her application services
        are legitimately hers. When Bob connects to alice.example.com, he uses
        this mechanism to verify that the certificate presented by the server
        has been issued by Alice. Since Bob can bind certificates to Alice in
        this way, he can use Alice's CA as a trust anchor for purposes of
        validating certificates for alice.example.com. Alice can additionally
        recommend that clients accept only her certificates using the CA
        constraints described above.</t>

        <t>As in Section <xref target="ca-cons"></xref> above, Alice may wish
        to represent this information to potential third-party CAs (Charlie)
        as well as to relying parties (Bob). Since publishing a certificate in
        a DANE record of this form authorizes the holder of the corresponding
        private key to represent alice.example.com, a CA that has received a
        request to issue a certificate from alice.example.com could use the
        DANE information to verify the requestor's authorization to receive a
        certificate for that domain. For example, a CA might choose to issue a
        certificate for a given domain name and public key only when the
        holder of the domain name has provisioned DANE information with a
        certificate containing the public key.</t>

        <t>Note that this use case is functionally equivalent to the case
        where Alice doesn't issue her own certificates, but uses Trent's CA,
        which is not well-known. In this case, Alice would be advising Bob
        that he should treat Trent as a trust anchor for purposes of
        validating Alice's certificates, rather than a CA operated by Alice
        herself. Bob would thus need a way to securely obtain Trent's trust
        anchor information, namely through DANE information.</t>

        <t>Alice's advertising of trust anchor material in this way does not
        guarantee that Bob will accept the advertised trust anchor. For
        example, Bob might have out-of-band information (such as a
        pre-existing local policy) that indicates that the CA advertised by
        Alice (Trent's CA) is not trustworthy, which would lead him to decide
        not to accept Trent as a TA, and thus to reject Alice's certificate if
        it is issued under Trent's CA.</t>

        <t>Providing trust anchor material in this way clearly requires
        DNSSEC, since corrupted or injected records could be used by an
        attacker to cause clients to trust an attacker's certificate (assuming
        that the attacker's certificate is not rejected by some other local
        policy). Deleted records will only result in connection failure and
        denial of service, although this could result in clients re-connecting
        without TLS (a downgrade attack), depending on the application.
        Therefore, in order for this use case to be safe, applications must
        forbid clients from falling back to unsecured channels when records
        appear to have been deleted (e.g., when a missing record has no NSEC
        or NSEC3 record).</t>

        <t>By the same token, this use case puts the most power in the hands
        of DNS operators. Since the operator of the appropriate DNS zone has
        de facto control over the content and signing of the zone, he can
        create false DANE records that bind a malicious party's certificate to
        a domain. This risk is especially important to keep in mind in cases
        where the operator of a DNS zone is a different entity than the holder
        of the domain, as in DNS hosting/outsourcing arrangements, since in
        these cases the DNS operator might be able to make changes to a domain
        that are not authorized by the holder of the domain.</t>

        <t>It should be noted that DNS operators already have the ability to
        obtain certificates for domains under their control, under certain CA
        policies. In the current system, CAs need to verify that an entity
        requesting a certificate for a domain is actually the legitimate
        holder of that domain. Typically this is done using information
        published about that domain, such as WHOIS email addresses or special
        records inserted into a domain. By manipulating these values, it is
        possible for DNS operators to obtain certificates from some well-known
        certificate authorities today without authorization from the true
        domain holder.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Delegated Services">
        <t>In addition to guarding against CA mis-issue, CA constraints and
        certificate constraints can also be used to constrain the set of
        certificates that can be used by an outsourcing provider. Suppose that
        Oscar operates alice.example.com on behalf of Alice. In particular,
        Oscar then has de facto control over what certificates to present in
        TLS handshakes for alice.example.com. In such cases, there are few
        ways that DNS-based information about TLS certificates could be
        configured, for example:<list style="numbers">
            <t>Alice has the A/AAAA records in her DNS and can sign them along
            with the DANE record, but Oscar and Alice now need to have tight
            coordination if the addresses and/or the certificates change.</t>

            <t>Alice refers to Oscar's DNS by delegating a sub-domain name to
            Oscar, and has no control over the A/AAAA, DANE or any other
            pieces under Oscar's control.</t>

            <t>Alice can put DANE records into her DNS server, but delegate
            the address records to Oscar's DNS server. This means that Alice
            can control the usage of certificates but Oscar is free to move
            the servers around as needed. The only coordination needed is when
            the certificates change, and then it would depend on how the DANE
            record is set up (i.e. a CA or an EE certificate pointer).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Which of these deployment patterns is used in a given deployment
        will determine what sort of constraints can be made. In cases where
        Alice controls DANE records (1 and 3), she can use CA and certificate
        constraints to control what certificates Oscar presents for Alice's
        application services. For instance, Alice might require Oscar to use
        certificates under a given set of CAs. This control, however, requires
        that Alice update DANE records when Oscar needs to change
        certificates. Cases where Oscar controls DANE records allow Oscar to
        maintain more autonomy from Alice, but by the same token, Alice cannot
        enforce any requirements on the certificates that Oscar presents in
        TLS handshakes.</t>

          client to determine whether DANE information is available for a
          site, so that a client can provide the highest level of security
          possible for a given application service. Clients that do not
          support DANE should continue to work as specified, regardless of
          whether DANE information is present or not.</t>

          <t hangText="Combination:">The DANE mechanism must allow multiple
          DANE statements of the above forms to be combined. For example, a
          domain holder should be able to specify that clients should accept a
          particular certificate (Section <xref target="cert-cons"></xref>) or
          any certificate issued by its own CA (Section <xref
          target="dom-iss"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="Roll-over:">The DANE mechanism must allow a site to
          transition from using one DANE mechanism to another. For example, a
          domain holder should be able to migrate from using DANE to assert a
          domain issued certificate (Section <xref target="dom-iss"></xref>)
          to using DANE to require an external CA (Section <xref
          target="ca-cons"></xref>), or vice versa. The DANE mechanism must
          also allow roll-over between records of the same-type, e.g., when
          changing CAs.</t>

          <t hangText="Simple Key Management:">DANE should have a mode in
          which the domain holder only needs to maintain a single long-lived
          public/private key pair.</t>

          <t hangText="Minimal Dependencies:">It should be possible for a site
          to deploy DANE without also deploying anything else, except
          DNSSEC.</t>

          <t hangText="Minimal Options:">Ideally, DANE should have only one
          operating mode. Practically, DANE should have as few operating modes
          as possible.</t>

          <t hangText="Wild Cards:">The mechanism for distributing DANE
          information should allow the use of DNS wild card labels (*) for
          setting DANE information for all names within a wild card
          expansion.</t>

          <t hangText="Redirection:">The mechanism for distributing DANE
          information should work when the application service name is the
          result of following a DNS redirection time (e.g., via CNAME or
          DNAME).</t>

      <t>The primary focus of this document is the enhancement of TLS
      authentication procedures using the DNS. The general effect of such
      mechanisms is to increase the role of DNS operators in authentication
      processes, either in place of or in addition to traditional third-party
      actors such as commercial certificate authorities. The specific security
      implications of the respective use cases are discussed in their
      respective sections above.</t>

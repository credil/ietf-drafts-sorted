Abstract 

   This document extends the pNFS protocol to communicate errors caused 
   by inability to access data servers referenced by layouts, including 
   checks performed by both clients and the MDS. The extension provides 
   means for clients to communicate client-detected access denial errors 
   to the MDS, including the case in which a client requests direct NFS 
   access via the MDS that the MDS cannot perform.

                           Figure 1 pNFS Architecture  
    

   In this document, "storage device" is used as a general term for a 
   data server and/or storage server for the file, block or object pNFS 
   layouts. 

   The current pNFS protocol [RFC5661] assumes that a client can access 
   every storage device (SD) included in a valid layout sent by the MDS 
   server, and provides no means to communicate client access failures 
   to the MDS. Access failures can impair pNFS performance scaling and 
   allow significant errors to go unreported. If the MDS can access all 
   the storage devices involved, but the client doesn't have sufficient 
   access rights to some storage devices, the client may choose to fall 
   back to accessing the file system using NFSV4.1 without pNFS support; 
   there are environments in which this behavior is undesirable, 
   especially if it occurs silently. An important example is addition of 
   a new storage device to which a large population of pNFS clients 
   (e.g., 1000s) lacks access permission. Layouts granted that use this 
   new device, result in client errors, requiring that all I/Os to that 
   new storage device be served by the MDS server. This creates a 
   performance and scalability bottleneck that may be difficult to 
   detect based on I/O behavior because the other storage devices are 
   functioning correctly.

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check          October 2010 
    

   The preferable approach to this scenario is to report the access 
   failures before any client attempts to issue any I/Os that can only 
   be serviced by the MDS server.  This makes the problem explicit, 
   rather than forcing the MDS, or a system administrator, to diagnose 
   the performance problem caused by client I/O using NFS instead of 
   pNFS. There are limits to this approach because complex mount 
   structures may prevent a client from detecting this situation at 
   mount time, but at a minimum, access problems involving the root of 
   the mount structure can be detected. 

   The most suitable time for the client to report inability to access a 
   storage device is at mount time, but this is not always possible.   
   If the application uses a special tag or a switch to the mount 
   command (e.g., -pnfs) and syscall to declare its intention to use 
   pNFS, at the client, the client can check for both pNFS support and 
   device accessibility. 

   This document introduces an error reporting mechanism that is an 
   extension to the return of a pNFS layout; a pNFS client MAY use this 
   mechanism to inform the MDS that the layout is being returned because 
   one or more data servers are not accessible to the client. Error 
   reporting at I/O time is not affected because the result of an 
   inaccessible data server may not be an I/O error if a subsequent 
   retry of the operation via the MDS is successful. 

   There is a related problem scenario involving an MDS that cannot 
   access some storage devices and hence cannot perform I/Os on behalf 
   of a client. In the case of the block layout [RFC5663] if the MDS 
   lacks access to a storage device (e.g., LUN), MDS implementations 
   generally do not export any filesystem using that storage device.  In 
   contrast to the block layout, MDSs for the file [RFC5661] and object 
   [RFC5664] layouts may be unable to access the storage devices that 
   store data for an exported filesystem.  This enables a file or object 
   layout MDS to provide layouts that contain client-inaccessible 
   devices. For the specific case of adding a new storage device to a 
   filesystem, MDS issuance of test I/Os to the newly added device 
   before using it in layouts avoids this problem scenario, but does not 
   cover loss of access to existing storage devices at a later time. 

   In addition, [RFC5661] states that a client can write through or read 
   from the MDS, even if it has a layout; this assumes that the MDS can 
   access all the storage devices. This document makes that assumed 
   access an explicit requirement.

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Changes to Operation 51: LAYOUTRETURN (RFC 5661) 

   The existing LAYOUTRETURN operation is extended by introducing three 
   new layout return types that correspond to the existing types: 

   o  LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_NO_ACCESS at file scope; 

   o  LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS at fsid scope; and 

   o  LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL_NO_ACCESS at client scope. 

   The first return type returns the layout for an individual file and 
   informs the server that the reason for the return is a storage device 
   connectivity problem. The second return type performs that function 
   for all layouts held by the client for the filesystem that 
   corresponds to the current filehandle used for the LAYOUTRETURN 
   operation.  The third return type performs that function for all 
   layouts held by the client; it is intended for situations in which a 
   device is shared across all or most of the filesystems from a server 
   for which the client has layouts. 

3.1. ARGUMENT (18.44.1) 

   The ARGUMENT specification of the LAYOUTRETURN operation in section 
   18.44.1 of [RFC5661] is replaced by the following XDR code [XDR]: 

     /* Constants used for new LAYOUTRETURN and CB_LAYOUTRECALL */ 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE      = 1; 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID      = 2; 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL       = 3; 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_NO_ACCESS    = 4; 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACESSS    = 5; 
     const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL_NO_ACCESS     = 6; 
      
     enum layoutreturn_type4 { 
          LAYOUTRETURN4_FILE = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE, 
          LAYOUTRETURN4_FSID = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID, 
          LAYOUTRETURN4_ALL  = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL,

3.2. RESULT (18.44.2) 

   The RESULT of the LAYOUTRETURN operation is unchanged; see section 
   18.44.2 of [RFC5661]. 

 
3.3. DESCRIPTION (18.44.3) 

   The following text is added to the end of the LAYOUTRETURN operation 
   DESCRIPTION in section 18.44.3 of [RFC5661]: 

   There are three NO_ACCESS layoutreturn_type4 values that indicate a 
   persistent lack of client ability to access storage device(s), 
   LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_NO_ACCESS, LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS and 
   LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL_NO_ACCESS. A client uses these return types to 
   return a layout (or portion thereof) for a file, return all layouts 
   for an FSID or all layouts from that server held by the client, and 
   in all cases to inform the server that the reason for the return is 
   the client's inability to access one or more storage devices. The 
   same stateid may be used or the client MAY force use of a new stateid 
   in order to report a new error. 

   An NFS error value (nfsstat4) is included for each device for these 
   three NO_ACCESS return types to provide additional information on the 
   cause. The allowed NFS errors are those that are valid for an NFS 
   READ or WRITE operation, and NFS4ERR_NXIO is also allowed to report 
   an inaccessible device. The server SHOULD log the received NFS error 
   value, but that error value does not affect server processing of the 
   LAYOUTRETURN operation. All uses of the NO_ACCESS layout return types 
   that report NFS errors SHOULD be logged by the client. 

   The client MAY use the new LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE_NO_ACCESS when only 
   one file, or a small number of files are affected. If the access  
   problem affects multiple devices, the client may use multiple file 
   layout return operations; each return operation SHOULD return a 
   layout extent obtained from the device for which an error is being 
   reported. In contrast, both LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID_NO_ACCESS and 
   LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL_NO_ACCESS include an array of <device, status> 
   pairs to enable a single operation to report errors for multiple 
   devices in a single operation. 

3.4. IMPLEMENTATION (18.44.4) 

   The following text is added to the end of the LAYOUTRETURN operation 
   IMPLEMENTATION in section 18.4.4 of [RFC5661]:

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check          October 2010 
    

   A client that expects to use pNFS for a mounted filesystem SHOULD 
   check for pNFS support at mount time. This check SHOULD be performed 
   by sending a GETDEVICELIST operation, followed by layout-type-
   specific checks for accessibility of each storage device returned by 
   GETDEVICELIST.  If the NFS server does not support pNFS, the 
   GETDEVICELIST operation will be rejected with an NFS4ERR_NOTSUPP 
   error; in this situation it is up to the client to determine whether 
   it is acceptable to proceed with NFS-only access. 

   Clients are expected to tolerate transient storage device errors, and 
   hence clients SHOULD NOT use the NO_ACCESS layout return types for 
   device access problems that may be transient. The methods by which a 
   client decides whether an access problem is transient vs. persistent 
   are implementation-specific, but may include retrying I/Os to a data 
   server under appropriate conditions.   

   When an I/O fails because a storage device is inaccessible, the 
   client SHOULD retry the failed I/O via the MDS. In this situation, 
   before retrying the I/O, the client SHOULD return the layout, or 
   inaccessible portion thereof, and SHOULD indicate which storage 
   device or devices was or were inaccessible. If the client does not do 
   this, the MDS may issue a layout recall callback in order to perform 
   the retried I/O. 

   Backwards compatibility may require a client to perform two layout 
   return operations to deal with servers that don't implement the 
   NO_ACCESS layoutreturn_type4 values and hence respond to them with 
   NFS4ERR_INVAL. In this situation, the client SHOULD perform an 
   ordinary layout return operation and remember that the new layout 
   NO_ACCESS return types are not to be used with that server. 

   The metadata server (MDS) SHOULD NOT use storage devices in pNFS 
   layouts that are not accessible to the MDS. At a minimum, the server 
   SHOULD check its own storage device accessibility before exporting a 
   filesystem that supports pNFS and when the device configuration for 
   such an exported filesystem is changed (e.g., to add a storage 
   device).  

   If an MDS is aware that a storage device is inaccessible to a client, 
   the MDS SHOULD NOT include that storage device in any pNFS layouts 
   sent to that client. An MDS SHOULD react to a client return of 
   inaccessible layouts by not using the inaccessible storage devices in 
   layouts for that client, but the MDS is not required to indefinitely 
   retain per-client storage device inaccessibility information. An MDS 
   is also not required to automatically reinstate use of a previously 
   inaccessible storage device; administrative intervention may be 
   required instead.

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check          October 2010 
    

   A client MAY perform I/O via the MDS even when the client holds a 
   layout that covers the I/O; servers MUST support this client 
   behavior, and MAY recall layouts as needed to complete I/Os. 

3.4.1. Storage Device Error Mapping (18.44.4.1, new) 

   The following text is added as new subsection 18.44.4.1 of [RFC5661]: 

   An NFS error value is sent for each device that the client reports as 
   inaccessible via a NO_ACCESS layout return type. In general: 

   o  If the client is unable to access the storage device, NFS4ERR_NXIO 
      SHOULD be used. 

   o  If the client is able to access the storage device, but permission 
      is denied, NFS4ERR_ACCESS SHOULD be used. 

   Beyond these two rules, error code usage is layout-type specific: 

   o  For the pNFS file layout, an indicative NFS error from a failed 
      read or write operation on the inaccessible device SHOULD be used. 

   o  For the pNFS block layout, other errors from the Storage Protocol 
      SHOULD be mapped to NFS4ERR_IO. In addition, the client SHOULD log 
      information about the actual storage protocol error (e.g., SCSI 
      status and sense data), but that information is not sent to the 
      pNFS server. 

   o  For the pNFS object layout, occurrences of the object error types 
      specified in [RFC5664] SHOULD be mapped to the following NFS 
      errors for use in LAYOUTRETURN: 

       o    PNFS_OSD_ERR_EIO            -> NFS4ERR_IO 

       o    PNFS_OSD_ERR_NOT_FOUND      -> NFS4ERR_STALE 

       o    PNFS_OSD_ERR_NO_SPACE       -> NFS4ERR_NOSPC 

       o    PNFS_OSD_ERR_BAD_CRED       -> NFS4ERR_INVAL

Internet-Draft      pNFS Access Permissions Check          October 2010 
    

   The LAYOUTRETURN NO_ACCESS return types are used for persistent 
   device errors; they do not replace other error reporting mechanisms 
   that also apply to transient errors (e.g., as specified for the 
   object layout in [RFC5664]). 

4. Change to NFS4ERR_NXIO Usage 

   This document specifies that the NFS4ERR_NXIO error SHOULD be used to 
   report an inaccessible storage device. To enable that usage, this 
   document updates [RFC5661] to allow use of the currently obsolete 
   NFS4ERR_NXIO error in the ARGUMENT of LAYOUTRETURN; NFS4ERR_NXIO 
   remains obsolete for all other uses of NFS errors. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document adds a small extension to the NFSv4 LAYOUTRETURN 
   operation.  The NFS and pNFS security considerations in [RFC5661], 
   [RFC5663] and [RFC5664] apply to the extended LAYOUTRETURN operation. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   There are no additional IANA considerations in this document beyond 
   the IANA Considerations covered in [RFC5661]. 

7. Conclusions 

   This draft specifies additions to the pNFS protocol addressing 
   inability to access storage devices used in pNFS layouts.

Acknowledgments 

   This draft includes ideas from discussions with the primary author of 
   the pNFS object layout, Benny Halevy, and the Linux kernel pNFS 
   maintainers, including Bruce Fields.  In addition, we thank the IETF 
   nfsv4 WG and the following individuals for their comments on prior 
   versions of this draft: Tom Haynes. 

   This document was prepared using 2-Word-v2.0.template.dot. 

Changes from draft-faibish-nfsv4-pnfs-access-permissions-check-03 

   - First nfsv4 WG draft version. 
   - Add ALL NO_ACCESS return type, so that there's a NO_ACCESS 
      return type for every current return type. 
   - Use NFS4ERR_ACCESS instead of NFS4ERR_PERM, and allow use of 
      NFS4ERR_NXIO for an unreachable data server. 
   - Simplify recommendation for initial access checks to only discuss 
      GETDEVICELIST. 
   - Add client guidance on riding through transient errors. 
   - State that server does not need to indefinitely retain device 
      inaccessibility information, and administrative intervention 
      may be required to restore use of a previously inaccessible 
      storage device. 
   - Remove "MUST" requirement for layout return if retry via MDS 
      fails.  Add warning that if the layout isn't returned in advance 
      of MDS I/O retry, the MDS may issue a callback to get it. 
   - Specify allowed errors (in payload) via reference to errors 
      allowed for READ and WRITE, plus allow NFS4ERR_NXIO. 
   - Provide information about how to map device errors (especially 
      from non-file layout types) to NFS errors.

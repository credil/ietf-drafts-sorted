         A Survey of Lower-than-Best-Effort Transport Protocols
                    draft-ietf-ledbat-survey-02.txt

Abstract

   This document provides a survey of transport protocols which are
   designed to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard
   TCP than standard TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it.
   Such protocols could be used for delay-insensitive "background"
   traffic, as they provide what is sometimes called a "less than" (or
   "lower than") best-effort service.

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey             December 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document presents a brief survey of proposals to attain a Less
   than Best Effort (LBE) service by means of end-to-end mechanisms.  We
   loosely define a LBE service as a service which results in smaller
   bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard TCP
   itself, when sharing a bottleneck with it.  We refer to systems that
   provide this service as Less than Best Effort (LBE) systems.

   Generally, LBE behavior can be achieved by reacting to queue growth
   earlier than standard TCP would, or by changing the congestion
   avoidance behavior of TCP without utilizing any additional implicit
   feedback.  Some mechanisms achieve an LBE behavior without modifying
   transport protocol standards (e.g., by changing the receiver window
   of standard TCP), whereas others leverage network-level mechanisms at
   the transport layer for LBE purposes.  According to this
   classification, solutions have been categorized in this document as
   delay-based transport protocols, non-delay-based transport protocols,
   upper-layer approaches and network-assisted approaches.  There is a
   substantial amount of work that is related to the LBE concept but not
   presenting a solution that can be installed in end hosts or expected
   to work over the Internet (e.g., a DiffServ-based, Lower-Effort
   service [RFC3662]); such proposals are outside the scope of this
   document.


2.  Delay-based transport protocols

   It is wrong to generally equate "little impact on standard TCP" with
   "small sending rate".  Unless the sender's maximum window is limited
   for some reason, and in the absence of ECN support, standard TCP will
   normally increase its rate until a queue overflows, causing one or
   more packets to be dropped and the rate to be reduced.  A protocol
   which stops increasing the rate before this event happens can, in
   principle, achieve a better performance than standard TCP.  In the
   absence of any other traffic, this is even true for TCP itself when
   its maximum send window is limited to the bandwidth*round-trip time
   (RTT) product.

   TCP Vegas [Bra+94] is one of the first protocols that was known to
   have a smaller sending rate than standard TCP when both protocols
   share a bottleneck [Kur+00] -- yet it was designed to achieve more,
   not less throughput than standard TCP.  Indeed, when it is the only
   protocol on the bottleneck, the throughput of TCP Vegas is greater
   than the throughput of standard TCP.  Depending on the bottleneck
   queue length, TCP Vegas itself can be starved by standard TCP flows.
   This can be remedied to some degree by the RED Active Queue
   Management mechanism [RFC2309].  Vegas linearly increases or

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey             December 2010


   decreases the sending rate, based on the difference between the
   expected throughput and the actual throughput.  The estimation is
   based on RTT measurements.

   The congestion avoidance behavior is the protocol's most important
   feature in terms of historical relevance as well as relevance in the
   context of this document (it has been shown that other elements of
   the protocol can sometimes play a greater role for its overall
   behavior [Hen+00]).  In Congestion Avoidance, once per RTT, TCP Vegas
   calculates the expected throughput as WindowSize / BaseRTT, where
   WindowSize is the current congestion window and BaseRTT is the
   minimum of all measured RTTs.  The expected throughput is then
   compared with the actual (measured) throughput.  If the actual
   throughput is smaller than the expected throughput minus a threshold
   beta, this is taken as a sign of congestion, causing the protocol to
   linearly decrease its rate.  If the actual throughput is greater than
   the expected throughput minus a threshold alpha (with alpha < beta),
   this is taken as a sign that the network is underutilized, causing
   the protocol to linearly increase its rate by one segment per RTT.

   TCP Vegas has been analyzed extensively.  One of the most prominent
   properties of TCP Vegas is its fairness between multiple flows of the
   same kind, which does not penalize flows with large propagation
   delays in the same way as standard TCP.  While it was not the first
   protocol that uses delay as a congestion indication, its predecessors
   (like CARD [Jai+89], Tri-S [Wan+91] or DUAL [Wan+92]) are not
   discussed here because of the historical "landmark" role that TCP
   Vegas has taken in the literature.

   Delay-based transport protocols which were designed to be non-
   intrusive include TCP Nice [Ven+02] and TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP)
   [Kuz+06].  TCP Nice [Ven+02] follows the same basic approach as TCP
   Vegas but improves upon it in some aspects.  Because of its moderate
   linear-decrease congestion response, TCP Vegas can affect standard
   TCP despite its ability to detect congestion early.  TCP Nice removes
   this issue by halving the congestion window (at most once per RTT,
   like standard TCP) instead of linearly reducing it.  To avoid being
   too conservative, this is only done if a fixed predefined fraction of
   delay-based incipient congestion signals appears within one RTT.
   Otherwise, TCP Nice falls back to the congestion avoidance rules of
   TCP Vegas if no packet was lost or standard TCP if a packet was lost.
   One more feature of TCP Nice is its ability to support a congestion
   window of less than one packet, by clocking out single packets over
   more than one RTT.  With ns-2 simulations and real-life experiments
   using a Linux implementation, the authors of [Ven+02] show that TCP
   Nice achieves its goal of efficiently utilizing spare capacity while
   being non-intrusive to standard TCP.

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey             December 2010


   Other than TCP Vegas and TCP Nice, TCP-LP [Kuz+06] uses only the one-
   way delay (OWD) instead of the RTT as an indicator of incipient
   congestion.  This is done to avoid reacting to delay fluctuations
   that are caused by reverse cross-traffic.  Using the TCP Timestamps
   option [RFC1323], the OWD is determined as the difference between the
   receiver's Timestamp value in the ACK and the original Timestamp
   value that the receiver copied into the ACK.  While the result of
   this subtraction can only precisely represent the OWD if clocks are
   synchronized, its absolute value is of no concern to TCP-LP and hence
   clock synchronization is unnecessary.  Using a constant smoothing
   parameter, TCP-LP calculates an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average
   (EWMA) of the measured OWD and checks whether the result exceeds a
   threshold within the range of the minimum and maximum OWD that was
   seen during the connections's lifetime; if it does, this condition is
   interpreted as an "early congestion indication".  The minimum and
   maximum OWD values are initialized during the slow-start phase.

   Regarding its reaction to an early congestion indication, TCP-LP
   tries to strike a middle ground between the overly conservative
   choice of _immediately_ setting the congestion window to one packet,
   and the presumably too aggressive choice of simply halving the
   congestion window like standard TCP; TCP-LP tries to delay the former
   action by an additional RTT, to see if there is persistent congestion
   or not.  It does so by halving the window at first in response to an
   early congestion indication, then initializing an "inference time-out
   timer", and maintaining the window size until this timer fires.  If
   another early congestion indication appeared during this "inference
   phase", the window is then set to 1; otherwise, the window is
   maintained and TCP-LP continues to increase it the standard Additive-
   Increase fashion.  This method ensures that it takes at least two
   RTTs for a TCP-LP flow to decrease its window to 1, and, like
   standard TCP, TCP-LP reacts to congestion at most once per RTT.

   Using a simple analytical model, the authors of TCP-LP [Kuz+06]
   illustrate the feasibility of a delay-based LBE transport by showing
   that, due to the non-linear relationship between throughput and RTT,
   it is possible to remain transparent to standard TCP even when the
   flows under consideration have a larger RTT than standard TCP flows.
   With ns-2 simulations and real-life experiments using a Linux
   implementation, the authors of [Kuz+06] show that TCP-LP is largely
   non-intrusive to TCP traffic while at the same time enabling it to
   utilize a large portion of the excess network bandwidth, which is
   fairly shared among competing TCP-LP flows.  They also show that
   using their protocol for bulk data transfers greatly reduces file
   transfer times of competing best-effort web traffic.

   Sync-TCP [Wei+05] follows a similar approach as TCP-LP, by adapting
   its reaction to congestion according to changes in the OWD.  By

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey             December 2010


   comparing the estimated (average) forward queuing delay to the
   maximum observed delay, Sync-TCP adapts the AIMD parameters depending
   on the trend followed by the average delay over an observation
   window.  Even though the authors of [Wei+05] did not explicitly
   consider its use as an LBE protocol, Sync-TCP was designed to react
   early to incipient congestion, while grabbing available bandwidth
   more aggressively than a standard TCP in congestion-avoidance mode.

   Delay-based congestion control is also at the basis of proposals
   aiming at adapting TCP's congestion avoidance to very high-speed
   networks.  Some of these proposals, like Compound TCP
   [Tan+06][Sri+08] and TCP Illinois [Liu+08], are hybrid loss- and
   delay-based mechanisms, whereas others (e.g., NewVegas [Dev+03], FAST
   TCP [Wei+06] or CODE TCP [Cha+10]) are variants of Vegas based solely
   on delays.

2.1.  Accuracy of delay-based congestion predictors

   The accuracy of delay-based congestion predictors has been the
   subject of a good deal of research, see e.g.  [Bia+03], [Mar+03],
   [Pra+04], [Rew+06], [McC+08].  The main result of most of these
   studies is that delays (or, more precisely, round-trip times) are, in
   general, weakly correlated with congestion.  There are several
   factors that may induce such a poor correlation:

   o  Bottleneck buffer size: in principle, a delay-based mechanism
      could be made "more than TCP friendly" _if_ buffers are "large
      enough", so that RTT fluctuations and/or deviations from the
      minimum RTT can be detected by the end-host with reasonable
      accuracy.  Otherwise, it may be hard to distinguish real delay
      variations from measurement noise.

   o  RTT measurement issues: in principle, RTT samples may suffer from
      poor resolution, due to timers which are too coarse-grained with
      respect to the scale of delay fluctuations.  Also, a flow may
      obtain a very noisy estimate of RTTs due to undersampling, under
      some circumstances (e.g., the flow rate is much lower than the
      link bandwidth).  For TCP, other potential sources of measurement
      noise include: TCP segmentation offloading (TSO) and the use of
      delayed ACKs [Hay10].  Finally, a congested reverse path may also
      result in an erroneous assessment of the congestion state of the
      forward path.

   o  Level of statistical multiplexing and RTT sampling: it may be easy
      for an individual flow to "miss" loss/queue overflow events,
      especially if the number of flows sharing a bottleneck buffer is
      significant.  This is nicely illustrated e.g. in Fig. 1 of
      [McC+08].

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey             December 2010


   o  Impact of wireless links: several mechanisms that are typical of
      wireless links, like link-layer scheduling and error recovery, may
      induce strong delay fluctuations over short time scales [Gur+04].

   Interestingly, the results of Bhandarkar et al.  [Bha+07] seem to
   paint a slightly different picture, regarding the accuracy of delay-
   based congestion prediction.  Bhandarkar et al. claim that it is
   possible to significantly improve prediction accuracy by adopting
   some simple techniques (smoothing of RTT samples, increasing the RTT
   sampling frequency).  Nonetheless, they acknowledge that even with
   such techniques, it is not possible to eradicate detection errors.
   Their proposed delay-based congestion avoidance method, PERT
   (Probabilistic Early Response TCP), mitigates the impact of residual
   detection errors by means of a probabilistic response mechanism to
   congestion detection events.

2.2.  Potential issues with delay-based congestion control for LBE
      transport

   Whether a delay-based protocol behaves in its intended manner (e.g.,
   it is "more than TCP friendly", or it grabs available bandwidth in a
   very aggressive manner) may therefore depend on the accuracy issues
   listed in Section 2.1.  Moreover, protocols like Vegas need to keep
   an estimate of the minimum ("base") delay; this makes such protocols
   highly sensitive to eventual changes in the end-to-end route during
   the lifetime of the flow [Mo+99].

   Regarding the issue of false positives/false negatives with a delay-
   based congestion detector, most studies focus on the loss of
   throughput coming from the erroneous detection of queue build-up and
   of alleviation of congestion.  Arguably, for a LBE transport protocol
   it's better to err on the "more-than-TCP-friendly side", that is, to
   always yield to _perceived_ congestion whether it is "real" or not;
   however, failure to detect congestion (due to one of the above
   accuracy problems) would result in behavior that is not LBE.  For
   instance, consider the case in which the bottleneck buffer is small,
   so that the contribution of queueing delay at the bottleneck to the
   global end-to-end delay is small.  In such a case, a flow using a
   delay-based mechanism might end up consuming a good deal of bandwidth
   with respect to a competing standard TCP flow, unless it also
   incorporates a suitable reaction to loss.

   A delay-based mechanism may also suffer from the so-called "latecomer
   advantage" (or latecomer unfairness) problem.  Consider the case in
   which the bottleneck link is already (very) congested.  In such a
   scenario, delay variations may be quite small, hence, it may be very
   difficult to tell an empty queue from a heavily-loaded queue, in
   terms of delay fluctuation.  Therefore, a newly-arriving delay-based

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey             December 2010


   flow may start sending faster when there is already heavy congestion,
   eventually driving away loss-based flows [Sha+05][Car+10].


3.  Non-delay-based transport protocols

   There exist a few transport-layer proposals that achieve an LBE
   service without relying on delay as an indicator of congestion.  In
   the algorithms discussed below the loss rate of the flow determines,
   either implicitly or explicitly, the sending rate (which is adapted
   so as to obtain a lower share of the available bandwidth than
   standard TCP); such mechanisms likely react to congestion more slowly
   than delay-based ones.

   4CP [Liu+07], which stands for "Competitive and Considerate
   Congestion Control", is a protocol which provides a LBE service by
   changing the window control rules of standard TCP.  A "virtual
   window" is maintained which, during a so-called "bad congestion
   phase" is reduced to less than a predefined minimum value of the
   actual congestion window.  The congestion window is only increased
   again once the virtual window exceeds this minimum, and in this way
   the virtual window controls the duration during which the sender
   transmits with a fixed minimum rate.  Whether the congestion state is
   "bad" or "good" depends on whether the loss event rate is above or
   below a threshold (or target) value.  The 4CP congestion avoidance
   algorithm allows for setting a target average window and avoids
   starvation of "background" flows while bounding the impact on
   "foreground" flows.  Its performance was evaluated in ns-2
   simulations and in real-life experiments with a kernel-level
   implementation in Microsoft Windows Vista.

   The MulTFRC [Dam+09] protocol is an extension of TCP-Friendly Rate
   Control (TFRC) [RFC5348] for multiple flows.  MulTFRC takes the main
   idea of MulTCP [Cro+98] and similar proposals (e.g., [Hac+04],
   [Hac+08], [Kuo+08]) a step further.  A single MulTCP flow tries to
   emulate (and be as friendly as) a number N > 1 of parallel TCP flows.
   By supporting values of N between 0 and 1, MulTFRC can be used as a
   mechanism for a LBE service.  Since it does not react to delay like
   the protocols described in Section 2 but adjusts its rate like TFRC,
   MulTFRC can probably be expected to be more aggressive than
   mechanisms such as TCP Nice or TCP-LP.  This also means that MulTFRC
   is less likely to be prone to starvation, as its aggressiveness is
   tunable at a fine granularity, even when N is between 0 and 1.


4.  Upper-layer approaches

   The proposals described in this section do not require modifying

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey             December 2010


   transport protocol standards.  Most of them can be regarded as
   running "on top" of an existing transport, even though they may be
   implemented either at the application layer (i.e., in user-level
   processes), or in the kernel of the end hosts' operating system.
   Such "upper-layer" mechanisms may arguably be easier to deploy than
   transport-layer approaches, since they do not require any changes to
   the transport itself.

   A simplistic, application-level approach to a background transport
   service may consist in scheduling automated transfers at times when
   the network is lightly loaded, as described in e.g.  [Dyk+02] for
   cooperative proxy caching.  An issue with such a technique is that it
   may not necessarily be appropriate to applications like peer-to-peer
   file transfer, since the notion of an "off-peak hour" is not
   meaningful when end-hosts may be located anywhere in the world.

   The so-called Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) [BITS]
   is implemented in several versions of Microsoft Windows.  BITS uses a
   system of application-layer priority levels for file-transfer jobs,
   together with monitoring of bandwidth usage of the network interface
   (or, in more recent versions, of the network gateway connected to the
   end-host), so that, low-priority transfers at a given end-host give
   way to both high-priority (foreground) transfers and traffic from
   interactive applications at the same host.

   A different approach is taken in [Egg+05]: here, the priority of a
   flow is reduced via a generic idletime scheduling strategy in a
   host's operating system.  While results presented in this paper show
   that the new scheduler can effectively shield regular tasks from low-
   priority ones (e.g., TCP from greedy UDP) with only a minor
   performance impact, it is an underlying assumption that all involved
   end hosts would use the idletime scheduler.  In other words, it is
   not the focus of this work to protect a standard TCP flow which
   originates from any host where the presented scheduling scheme may
   not be implemented.

4.1.  Receiver-oriented, flow-control based approaches

   Some proposals for achieving an LBE behavior work by exploiting
   existing transport-layer features -- typically, at the "receiving"
   side.  In particular, TCP's built-in flow control can be used as a
   means to achieve a low-priority transport service.

   The mechanism described in [Spr+00] is an example of the above
   technique.  Such mechanism controls the bandwidth by letting the
   receiver intelligently manipulate the receiver window of standard
   TCP.  This is possible because the authors assume a client-server
   setting where the receiver's access link is typically the bottleneck.



Welzl & Ros               Expires June 4, 2011                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey             December 2010


   The scheme incorporates a delay-based calculation of the expected
   queue length at the bottleneck, which is quite similar to the
   calculation in the above delay-based protocols, e.g.  TCP Vegas.
   Using a Linux implementation, where TCP flows are classified
   according to their application's needs, Spring et al. show in
   [Spr+00] that a significant improvement in packet latency can be
   attained over an unmodified system, while maintaining good link
   utilization.

   A similar method is employed by Mehra et al.  [Meh+03], where both
   the advertised receiver window and the delay in sending ACK messages
   are dynamically adapted to attain a given rate.  As in [Spr+00],
   Mehra et al. assume that the bottleneck is located at the receiver's
   access link.  However, the latter also propose a bandwidth-sharing
   system, allowing to control the bandwidth allocated to different
   flows, as well as to allot a minimum rate to some flows.

   Receiver window tuning is also done in [Key+04], where choosing the
   right value for the window is phrased as an optimization problem.  On
   this basis, two algorithms are presented, binary search -- which is
   faster than the other one at achieving a good operation point but
   fluctuates -- and stochastic optimization, which does not fluctuate
   but converges slower than binary search.  These algorithms merely use
   the previous receiver window and the amount of data received during
   the previous control interval as input.  According to [Key+04], the
   encouraging simulation results suggest that such an application level
   mechanism can work almost as well as a transport layer scheme like
   TCP-LP.

   Another way of dealing with non-interactive flows, like e.g. web
   prefetching, is to rate-limit the transfer of such bursty traffic
   [Cro+98b].  Note that one of the techniques used in [Cro+98b] is,
   precisely, to have the downloading application adapt the TCP receiver
   window, so as to reduce the data rate to the minimum needed (thus,
   disturbing other flows as little as possible while respecting a
   deadline for the transfer of the data).


5.  Network-assisted approaches

   Network-layer mechanisms, like active queue management (AQM) and
   packet scheduling in routers, can be exploited by a transport
   protocol for achieving an LBE service.  Such approaches may result in
   improved protection of non-LBE flows (e.g., when scheduling is used);
   besides, approaches using an explicit, AQM-based congestion signaling
   may arguably be more robust than, say, delay-based transports for

   modifications in both end-hosts and intermediate network nodes.

   Harp [Kok+04] realizes a LBE service by dissipating background
   traffic to less-utilized paths of the network, based on multipath
   routing and multipath congestion control.  This is achieved without
   changing all routers, by using edge nodes as relays.  According to
   the authors, these edge nodes should be gateways of organizations in
   order to align their scheme with usage incentives, but the technical
   solution would also work if Harp was only deployed in end hosts.  It
   detects impending congestion by looking at delay, similar to TCP Nice
   [Ven+02], and manages to improve utilization and fairness over pure
   single-path solutions.

   Another technique is that used by protocols like NF-TCP [Aru+10b],
   where a bandwidth-estimation module integrated into the transport
   protocol allows to rapidly take advantage of free capacity.  NF-TCP
   combines this with an early congestion detection based on Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] and RED [RFC2309]; when
   congestion starts building up, appropriate tuning of a RED queue
   allows to mark low-priority (i.e., NF-TCP) packets with a much higher
   probability than high-priority (i.e., standard TCP) packets, so low-
   priority flows yield up bandwidth before standard TCP flows.

   In [Ven+08], Venkataraman et al. propose a transport-layer approach
   to leverage an existing, network-layer LBE service based on priority
   queueing.  The transport protocol, which they call PLT (Priority-
   Layer Transport), splits a layer-4 connection into two flows, a high-
   priority one and a low-priority one.  The high-priority flow is sent
   over the higher-priority queueing class (in principle, offering a
   best-effort service) using an AIMD, TCP-like congestion control
   mechanism.  The low-priority flow, which is mapped to the LBE class,
   uses a non TCP-friendly congestion control algorithm.  The goal of
   PLT is thus to maximize its aggregate throughput by exploiting unused
   capacity in an aggressive way, while protecting standard TCP flows
   carried by the best-effort class.  [Ott+03] proposes simple changes
   to the AIMD parameters of TCP for use over a network-layer LBE
   service, so that such "filler" traffic may aggressively consume
   unused bandwidth.  Note that [Ven+08] also considers a mechanism for
   detecting the lack of priority queueing in the network, so that the
   non-TCP friendly flow may be inhibited.  The PLT receiver monitors
   the loss rate of both flows; if the high-priority flow starts seeing
   losses while the low-priority one does not experience 100% loss, this
   is taken as an indication of the absence of strict priority queueing.

9.  Changes from the previous version (section to be removed later)

   o  The classification / taxonomy was (hopefully) improved.  Also, the
      focus of the document (i.e., end-to-end approaches for attaining
      LBE-ness) has been made clearer; text on network layer-based LBE
      was removed, for the most part.

   o  Some parts of Section 2 were reorganized for more clarity.

   o  Proposals in Section 4 have been reorganized, and some text was
      added, to better distinguish between "pure" upper-layer approaches
      and approaches that exploit existing transport features.

   o  Some text was added to Sections 3, 4 and 5 to better explain what
      these classes of proposals are about.

   o  Added some more text on the pros and cons of the different kinds
      of approaches.

   o  Fixed a bad reference to a figure from [McC+08] in Section 2.1.

   o  Finished a remaining TODO in Section 2.1.

   o  Most protocol proposals are now referred to by their name.

   o  Added references to Vegas's ancestors.

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey                March 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document presents a brief survey of proposals to attain a Less
   than Best Effort (LBE) service without help from routers.  We loosely
   define a LBE service as a service which results in smaller bandwidth
   and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard TCP itself when
   sharing a bottleneck with it.  We refer to systems that provide this
   service as Less than Best Effort (LBE) systems.  Generally, LBE
   behavior can be achieved by reacting to queue growth earlier than
   standard TCP would, or by changing the congestion avoidance behavior
   of TCP without utilizing any additional implicit feedback.  Some
   mechanisms achieve a LBE behavior at the application layer, e.g. by
   changing the receiver window of standard TCP, and there is also a
   substantial amount of work that is related to the LBE concept but not
   presenting a solution that can be installed in end hosts or expected
   to work over the Internet.  According to this classification,
   solutions have been categorized in this document as delay-based
   transport protocols, non-delay-based transport protocols, application
   layer approaches and orthogonal work.


2.  Delay-based transport protocols

   It is wrong to generally equate "little impact on standard TCP" with
   "small sending rate".  Unless the sender's maximum window is limited
   for some reason, and in the absence of ECN support, standard TCP will
   normally increase its rate until a queue overflows, causing one or
   more packets to be dropped and the rate to be reduced.  A protocol
   which stops increasing the rate before this event happens can, in
   principle, achieve a better performance than standard TCP.  In the
   absence of any other traffic, this is even true for TCP itself when
   its maximum send window is limited to the bandwidth*round-trip time
   (RTT) product.

   TCP Vegas [Bra+94] is one of the first protocols that was known to
   have a smaller sending rate than standard TCP when both protocols
   share a bottleneck [Kur+00] -- yet it was designed to achieve more,
   not less throughput than standard TCP.  Indeed, when it is the only
   protocol on the bottleneck, the throughput of TCP Vegas is greater
   than the throughput of standard TCP.  Depending on the bottleneck
   queue length, TCP Vegas itself can be starved by standard TCP flows.
   This can be remedied to some degree by the RED Active Queue
   Management mechanism [RFC2309].

   The congestion avoidance behavior is the protocol's most important
   feature in terms of historical relevance as well as relevance in the
   context of this document (it has been shown that other elements of
   the protocol can sometimes play a greater role for its overall



Welzl & Ros             Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey                March 2010


   behavior [Hen+00]).  In Congestion Avoidance, once per RTT, TCP Vegas
   calculates the expected throughput as WindowSize / BaseRTT, where
   WindowSize is the current congestion window and BaseRTT is the
   minimum of all measured RTTs.  The expected throughput is then
   compared with the actual (measured) throughput.  If the actual
   throughput is smaller than the expected throughput minus a threshold
   beta, this is taken as a sign of congestion, causing the protocol to
   linearly decrease its rate.  If the actual throughput is greater than
   the expected throughput minus a threshold alpha (with alpha < beta),
   this is taken as a sign that the network is underutilized, causing
   the protocol to linearly increase its rate.

   TCP Vegas has been analyzed extensively.  One of the most prominent
   properties of TCP Vegas is its fairness between multiple flows of the
   same kind, which does not penalize flows with large propagation
   delays in the same way as standard TCP.  While it was not the first
   protocol that uses delay as a congestion indication, its predecessors
   (which can be found in [Bra+94]) are not discussed here because of
   the historical "landmark" role that TCP Vegas has taken in the
   literature.

   Transport protocols which were designed to be non-intrusive include
   TCP-LP [Kuz+06] and TCP Nice [Ven+02].  Using a simple analytical
   model, the authors of [Kuz+06] illustrate the feasibility of this
   endeavor by showing that, due to the non-linear relationship between
   throughput and RTT, it is possible to remain transparent to standard
   TCP even when the flows under consideration have a larger RTT than
   standard TCP flows.

   TCP Nice [Ven+02] follows the same basic approach as TCP Vegas but
   improves upon it in some aspects.  Because of its moderate linear-
   decrease congestion response, TCP Vegas can affect standard TCP
   despite its ability to detect congestion early.  TCP Nice removes
   this issue by halving the congestion window (at most once per RTT,
   like standard TCP) instead of linearly reducing it.  To avoid being
   too conservative, this is only done if a fixed predefined fraction of
   delay-based incipient congestion signals appears within one RTT.
   Otherwise, TCP Nice falls back to the congestion avoidance rules of
   TCP Vegas if no packet was lost or standard TCP if a packet was lost.
   One more feature of TCP Nice is its ability to support a congestion
   window of less than one packet, by clocking out single packets over
   more than one RTT.  With ns-2 simulations and real-life experiments
   using a Linux implementation, the authors of [Ven+02] show that TCP
   Nice achieves its goal of efficiently utilizing spare capacity while
   being non-intrusive to standard TCP.

   Other than TCP Vegas and TCP Nice, TCP-LP uses only the one-way delay
   (OWD) instead of the RTT as an indicator of incipient congestion.

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey                March 2010


   This is done to avoid reacting to delay fluctuations that are caused
   by reverse cross-traffic.  Using the TCP Timestamps option [RFC1323],
   the OWD is determined as the difference between the receiver's
   Timestamp value in the ACK and the original Timestamp value that the
   receiver copied into the ACK.  While the result of this subtraction
   can only precisely represent the OWD if clocks are synchronized, its
   absolute value is of no concern to TCP-LP and hence clock
   synchronization is unnecessary.  Using a constant smoothing
   parameter, TCP-LP calculates an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average
   (EWMA) of the measured OWD and checks whether the result exceeds a
   threshold within the range of the minimum and maximum OWD that was
   seen during the connections's lifetime; if it does, this condition is
   interpreted as an "early congestion indication".  The minimum and
   maximum OWD values are initialized during the slow-start phase.

   Regarding its reaction to an early congestion indication, TCP-LP
   tries to strike a middle ground between the overly conservative
   choice of immediately setting the congestion window to one packet and
   the presumably too aggressive choice of halving the congestion window
   like standard TCP.  It does so by halving the window at first in
   response to an early congestion indication, then initializing an
   "interference time-out timer", and maintaining the window size until
   this timer fires.  If another early congestion indication appeared
   during this "interference phase", the window is then set to 1;
   otherwise, the window is maintained and TCP-LP continues to increase
   it the standard Additive-Increase fashion.  This method ensures that
   it takes at least two RTTs for a TCP-LP flow to decrease its window
   to 1, and, like standard TCP, TCP-LP reacts to congestion at most
   once per RTT.

   With ns-2 simulations and real-life experiments using a Linux
   implementation, the authors of [Kuz+06] show that TCP-LP is largely
   non-intrusive to TCP traffic while at the same time enabling it to
   utilize a large portion of the excess network bandwidth, which is
   fairly shared among competing TCP-LP flows.  They also show that
   using their protocol for bulk data transfers greatly reduces file
   transfer times of competing best-effort web traffic.

   TODO: add a brief discussion on BitTorrent's uTP? (after all, it is
   already implemented and deployed?)

   Delay-based congestion control is also at the basis of proposals
   aiming at adapting TCP's congestion avoidance to very high-speed
   networks.  Some of these proposals [Tan+06][Sri+08][Liu+08] are
   hybrid loss- and delay-based mechanisms, whereas others
   [Dev+03][Wei+06][Cha+10] are variants of Vegas based solely on
   delays.

2.1.  Accuracy of delay-based congestion predictors

   The accuracy of delay-based congestion predictors has been the
   subject of a good deal of research, see e.g.  [Bia+03], [Mar+03],
   [Pra+04], [Rew+06], [McC+08].  The main result of most of these
   studies is that delays (or, more precisely, round-trip times) are, in
   general, weakly correlated with congestion.  There are several
   factors that may induce such a poor correlation:

   o  Bottleneck buffer size: in principle, a delay-based mechanism
      could be made "more than TCP friendly" _if_ buffers are "large
      enough", so that RTT fluctuations and/or deviations from the
      minimum RTT can be detected by the end-host with reasonable
      accuracy.  Otherwise, it may be hard to distinguish real delay
      variations from measurement noise.

   o  RTT measurement issues: in principle, RTT samples may suffer from
      poor resolution, due to timers which are too coarse-grained with
      respect to the scale of delay fluctuations.  Also, a flow may
      obtain a very noisy estimate of RTTs due to undersampling, under
      some circumstances (e.g., the flow rate is much lower than the
      link bandwidth).  For TCP, other potential sources of measurement
      noise include: TCP segmentation offloading (TSO) and the use of
      delayed ACKs [Hay10].

   o  Level of statistical multiplexing and RTT sampling: it may be easy
      for an individual flow to "miss" loss/queue overflow events,
      especially if the number of flows sharing a bottleneck buffer is
      significant.  This is nicely illustrated e.g. in Fig. 2 of
      [McC+08].

   o  Impact of wireless links: several mechanisms that are typical of
      wireless links, like link-layer scheduling and error recovery, may
      induce strong delay fluctuations over short time scales [Gur+04].

   Whether a delay-based protocol behaves in its intended manner (e.g.,
   it is "more than TCP friendly", or it grabs available bandwidth in a
   very aggressive manner) may therefore depend on the accuracy issues
   listed above.

   TODO: incorporate [Bha+07] and any references therein that may be
   missing.

2.2.  Delay-based congestion control = LBE?

   Regarding the issue of false positives/false negatives with a delay-
   based congestion detector, most studies focus on the loss of
   throughput coming from the erroneous detection of queue build-up and



Welzl & Ros             Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey                March 2010


   of alleviation of congestion.  Arguably, for a LBE transport protocol
   it's better to err on the "more-than-TCP-friendly side", that is, to
   always yield to _perceived_ congestion whether it is "real" or not;
   however, failure to detect congestion (due to one of the above
   accuracy problems) would result in behavior that is not LBE.  For
   instance, consider the case in which the bottleneck buffer is small,
   so that the contribution of queueing delay at the bottleneck to the
   global end-to-end delay is small.  In such a case, a flow using a
   delay-based mechanism might end up consuming a good deal of bandwidth
   with respect to a competing standard TCP flow, unless it also
   incorporates a suitable reaction to loss.

   Consider also the case in which the bottleneck link is already (very)
   congested.  In such a scenario, delay variations may be quite small,
   hence, it may be very difficult to tell an empty queue from a
   heavily-loaded queue, in terms of delay fluctuation.  Therefore, a
   newly-arriving delay-based flow may start sending faster when there
   is already heavy congestion, eventually driving away loss-based flows
   [Sha+05].


3.  Non-delay-based transport protocols

   4CP [Liu+07], which stands for "Competitive and Considerate
   Congestion Control", is a protocol which provides a LBE service by
   changing the window control rules of standard TCP.  A "virtual
   window" is maintained, which, during a so-called "bad congestion
   phase" is reduced to less than a predefined minimum value of the
   actual congestion window.  The congestion window is only increased
   again once the virtual window exceeds this minimum, and in this way
   the virtual window controls the duration during which the sender
   transmits with a fixed minimum rate.  The 4CP congestion avoidance
   algorithm allows for setting a target average window and avoids
   starvation of "background" flows while bounding the impact on
   "foreground" flows.  Its performance was evaluated in ns-2
   simulations and in real-life experiments with a kernel-level
   implementation in Microsoft Windows Vista.

   Some work was done on applying weights to congestion control
   mechanisms, allowing a flow to be as aggressive as a number of
   parallel TCP flows at the same time.  This is usually motivated by
   the fact that users may want to assign different priorities to
   different flows.  The first, and best known, such protocol is MulTCP
   [Cro+98], which emulates N TCPs in a rather simple fashion.  An
   improved version of MulTCP is presented in [Hac+04], and there is
   also a variant where only one feedback loop is applied to control a
   larger traffic aggregate by the name of Probe-Aided (PA-)MulTCP
   [Kuo+08].  Another protocol, CP [Ott+04], applies the same concept to



Welzl & Ros             Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            LBE Transport Survey                March 2010


   the TFRC protocol [RFC5348] in order to provide such fairness
   differentiation for multimedia flows.

   The general assumption underlying all of the above work is that these
   protocols are "N-TCP-friendly", i.e. they are as TCP-friendly as N
   TCPs, where N is a positive (and possibly natural) number which is
   greater than or equal to 1.  The MulTFRC [Dam+09] protocol, another
   extension of TFRC for multiple flows, is however able to support
   values between 0 and 1, making it applicable as a mechanism for a LBE
   service.  Since it does not react to delay like the mechanisms above
   but adjusts its rate like TFRC, it can probably be expected to be
   more aggressive than mechanisms such as TCP Nice or TCP-LP.  This
   also means that MulTFRC is less likely to be prone to starvation, as
   its aggression is tunable at a fine granularity even when N is
   between 0 and 1.


4.  Application layer approaches

   The mechanism described in [Spr+00] controls the bandwidth by letting
   the receiver intelligently manipulate the receiver window of standard
   TCP.  This is done because the authors assume a client-server setting
   where the receiver's access link is typically the bottleneck.  The
   scheme incorporates a delay-based calculation of the expected queue
   length at the bottleneck, which is quite similar to the calculation
   in the above delay based protocols, e.g.  TCP Vegas.  Using a Linux
   implementation, where TCP flows are classified according to their
   application's needs, it is shown that a significant improvement in
   packet latency can be attained over an unmodified system while
   maintaining good link utilization.

   Receiver window tuning is also done in [Key+04], where choosing the
   right value for the window is phrased as an optimization problem.  On
   this basis, two algorithms are presented, binary search -- which is
   faster than the other one at achieving a good operation point but
   fluctuates -- and stochastic optimization, which does not fluctuate
   but converges slower than binary search.  These algorithms merely use
   the previous receiver window and the amount of data received during
   the previous control interval as input.  According to [Key+04], the
   encouraging simulation results suggest that such an application level
   mechanism can work almost as well as a transport layer scheme like
   TCP-LP.

   TODO: mention other rwnd tuning and different application layer work,
   e.g. from related work sections of [Egg+05] and [Kok+04] and intro of
   [Key+04].

5.  Orthogonal work

   Various suggestions have been published for realizing a LBE service
   by influencing the way packets are treated in routers.  One example
   is the Persistent Class Based Queuing (P-CBQ) scheme presented in
   [Car+01], which is a variant of Class Based Queuing (CBQ) with per-
   flow accounting.  RFC 3662 [RFC3662] defines a DiffServ per-domain
   behavior called "Lower Effort".  Similar Lower-Effort PDBs have been
   tested and deployed, at least in research networks [Cho+03], [QBSS].

   Harp [Kok+04] realizes a LBE service by dissipating background
   traffic to less-utilized paths of the network.  This is achieved
   without changing routers by using edge nodes as relays.  According to
   the authors, these edge nodes should be gateways of organizations in
   order to align their scheme with usage incentives, but the technical
   solution would also work if Harp was only deployed in end hosts.  It
   detects impending congestion by looking at delay similar to TCP Nice
   [Ven+02] and manages to improve utilization and fairness over pure
   single-path solutions.

   An entirely different approach is taken in [Egg+05]: here, the
   priority of a flow is reduced via a generic idletime scheduling
   strategy in a host's operating system.  While results presented in
   this paper show that the new scheduler can effectively shield regular
   tasks from low-priority ones (e.g.  TCP from greedy UDP) with only a
   minor performance impact, it is an underlying assumption that all
   involved end hosts would use the idletime scheduler.  In other words,
   it is not the focus of this work to protect a standard TCP flow which
   originates from any host where the presented scheduling scheme may
   not be implemented.

   In [Ven+08], Venkataraman et al. propose a transport-layer approach
   to leverage an existing, network-layer LBE service based on priority
   queueing.  The transport protocol, which they call PLT (Priority-
   Layer Transport), splits a layer-4 connection into two flows, a high-
   priority one and a low-priority one.  The high-priority flow is sent
   over the higher-priority queueing class (in principle, offering a
   best-effort service) using an AIMD, TCP-like congestion control
   mechanism.  The low-priority flow, which is mapped to the LBE class,
   uses a non TCP-friendly congestion control algorithm.  The goal of
   PLT is thus to maximize its aggregate throughput by exploiting unused
   capacity in an aggressive way, while protecting standard TCP flows
   carried by the best-effort class.  [Ott+03] proposes simple changes
   to the AIMD parameters of TCP for use over a network-layer LBE
   service, so that such "filler" traffic may aggressively consume
   unused bandwidth.  Note that [Ven+08] also considers a mechanism for
   detecting the lack of priority queueing in the network, so that the
   non-TCP friendly flow may be inhibited.  The PLT receiver monitors

   the loss rate of both flows; if the high-priority flow starts seeing
   losses while the low-priority one does not experience 100% loss, this
   is taken as an indication of the absence of strict priority queueing.

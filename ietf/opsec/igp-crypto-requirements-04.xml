      <t>The routing protocols Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2), Intermediate 
			System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Routing Information Protocol (RIP) 
			currently define cleartext and MD5 (Message Digest 5) methods for authenticating 
			protocol packets. Recently effort has been made to add support for the SHA 
			(Secure Hash Algorithm) family of hash functions for the purpose of 
			authenticating routing protocol packets for RIP, IS-IS and OSPF. </t>

 	<t> To encourage interoperability between disparate implementations, it is
		  imperative that we specify the expected minimal set of algorithms thereby ensuring that 
		 there is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have in common.  </t>

	<t> Similarly RIPng and OSPFv3 support IPSec algorithms for authenticating their protocol packets. </t>

	<t> This document examines the current set of available algorithms with interoperability 
			and effective cryptographic authentication protection being the principle considerations. 
			Cryptographic authentication of these routing protocols requires the availability of the 
			same algorithms in disparate implementations. It is desirable that newly specified algorithms 
			should be implemented and available in routing protocol implementations because they
			may be promoted to requirements at some future time. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Most routing protocols include three different types of authentication schemes: 
		Null authentication, cleartext Password and a Cryptographic Authentication scheme. 
		Null authentication is equivalent to having no authentication scheme at all.  </t>

	<t> In a cleartext scheme, also known as, simple password scheme, the password is 
			exchanged completely unprotected and anyone with physical access to the network 
			can learn the password and compromise the integrity of the routing domain. 
		The simple password scheme protects from accidental establishment of routing sessions
		 in a given domain, but beyond that it offers no additional protection. </t>

	<t> In a cryptographic authentication scheme, routers share a secret key which is 
		used to generate a message authentication code for each of the protocol packets.  
		Today, routing protocols that implement message authentication codes often use a keyed
	 MD5 <xref target="RFC1321"></xref> digest.  The recent escalating series of attacks on
   MD5 raise concerns about its remaining useful lifetime. </t>

	<t> These attacks may not necessarily result in direct vulnerabilities for keyed MD5 digests as 
		message authentication codes because the colliding message may not correspond to a 
		syntactically correct protocol packet.  The known collision, pre-image, and second pre-image 
		attacks <xref target="RFC4270"></xref> on MD5 may not increase the effectiveness of the key recovery attacks on HMAC-MD5. 
		Regardless, there is a need felt to deprecated MD5 <xref target="RFC1321"></xref> as the basis for the HMAC algorithm in
		 favor of stronger digest algorithms. </t>

	<t> In light of these considerations, there are proposals to replace HMAC-MD5 with keyed HMAC-SHA <xref target="SHS"></xref> 
		digests where HMAC-MD5 is  currently mandated in RIPv2 <xref target="RFC2453"></xref> 
		and IS-IS <xref target="ISO"></xref>  <xref target="RFC1195"></xref>  and
		keyed-MD5 in OSPFv2 <xref target="RFC2328"></xref>. </t>

	<t> OSPFv3 <xref target="RFC5340"></xref> and RIPng <xref target="RFC2080"></xref> 
		rely on the IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) <xref target="RFC4302"></xref>  and 
		IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303"></xref> 
        in order to provide integrity, authentication, and/or confidentiality.</t>

	<t> However, the nature of cryptography is that algorithmic improvement is an ongoing process and as is the exploration 
		and refinement of attack vectors. An algorithm believed to be strong today may be demonstrated to be weak tomorrow. 
		Given this, the choice of preferred algorithm should favor the minimization of the likelihood of it being compromised quickly. </t>

	<t> It should be recognized that preferred algorithm(s) will change over time to adapt to the evolving threats. 
		At any particular time, the mandatory to implement algorithm(s) might not be specified in the base protocol 
		specification. As protocols are extended the preference for presently stronger algorithms presents a problem
		 both on the question of interoperability of existing and future implementations with respect to standards and 
	operational preference for the configuration as deployed.  </t>

	<t> It is expected an implementation should support changing of security (authentication) keys. 
		Changing the symmetric key used in any HMAC algorithm on a periodic basis is good security practice. 
		Operators need to plan for this. </t>

	<t> Implementations can support in-service key change so that no control packets are lost. 
		During an in-service/in-band key change more than one key can be active for receiving packets for a session.
	 Some protocols support a key identifier which allows the two peers of a session to have multiple keys 
	simultaneously for a session.  </t>

	<t> However, these protocols currently manage keys manually (i.e., operator intervention) or dynamically based on 
		some timer or security protocol.
</t>

      <section title="Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)">
        <t>The IS-IS specification allows for authentication of its Protocol Data Units
             (PDUs) via the authentication TLV (TLV 10) in the PDU. 
       		The base specification <xref target="ISO"></xref> had provisions only for cleartext passwords. 
			<xref target="RFC5304"></xref> extends the authentication capabilities by providing 
			cryptographic authentication for IS-IS PDUs. It mandates support for HMAC-MD5. </t>

		<t> <xref target="RFC5310"></xref> adds support for the use of any cryptographic hash 
		function for authenticating IS-IS PDUs. It in addition to this, also details how IS-IS can use 
		HMAC construct along with the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) family of 
		cryptographic hash functions to secure IS-IS PDUs. </t>

   <section title="Authentication Scheme Selection">
	<t>
	In order for IS-IS implementations to securely interoperate, they must 
	support one or more authentication schemes in common. This section 
	specifies the preference for standards conformant IS-IS implementations, 
	which desire to utilize the security feature.
	</t>

	<t>
	The earliest interoperability requirement for authentication as stated by 
	<xref target="ISO"></xref>  <xref target="RFC1195"></xref> 
	required all implementations to support cleartext Password.  This authentication 
	scheme's utility is limited to precluding the accidental introduction of a new IS into a 
	broadcast domain. Operators should not use this scheme as it 
	provides no protection against an attacker with access to the broadcast domain as 
	anyone can determine the secret password through inspection of the PDU. This 
	mechanism does not provide any significant level of security and should be avoided.
	</t>

	<t>
	<xref target="RFC5304"></xref>  defined the cryptographic authentication scheme for IS-IS.
	HMAC-MD5 was the only algorithm specified, hence it is mandated.
	<xref target="RFC5310"></xref> defined a generic cryptographic scheme and added support
  for additional algorithms.  Implementations should support  <xref target="RFC5310"></xref> 
  as it defines the generic cryptographic authentication scheme.

			 supports any digest algorithm (i.e., cryptographic hash function). </t>            
      </list></t>

	<t>
	As noted earlier, there is a desire to deprecate the use of MD5.  IS-IS implementations will 
	likely migrate to an authentication scheme supported by <xref target="RFC5310"></xref> 
	because it is algorithm agnostic. Possible digest algorithms included: SHA-1, 
	SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  Picking at least one mandatory-to-implement

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
     <t>
The cryptographic mechanisms referenced in this document provide only 
	authentication algorithms. These algorithms do not provide confidentiality. 
	Encrypting the content of the packet and thereby providing confidentiality is not
	 considered in the definition of the routing protocols.
	</t>

 <t>
The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength
	 of the underlying hash function and on the size and quality of the key. The feasibility
	 of attacking the integrity of routing protocol messages protected by keyed digests 
	may be significantly more limited than that of other data, however preference for 
	one family of algorithms over another may also change independently of the 
	perceived risk to a particular protocol.
	</t>

 <t>
	To ensure greater security, the keys used should be changed periodically 
	and implementations must be able to store and use more than one key at 
	the same time. Operational experience suggests that the lack of periodic rekeying 
	is a source of significant exposure and that the lifespan of shared keys in the 
	network is frequently measured in years.
	</t>

 <t>
	While simple password schemes are well represented in the document 
	series and in conformant implementations of the protocols, the inability to 
	offer either integrity or identity protection are sufficient reason to strongly discourage their use.
	</t>

<t>
	This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic algorithms for use in the
	 authentication of routing protocol packets being exchanged between adjacent routing 
	processes.  The cryptographic algorithms identified in this document are not 
	known to be broken at the current time, and ongoing cryptographic research so 
	far leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure in the foreseeable future. 
	We expect that new revisions of this document will be issued in the future to reflect current
	 thinking on the algorithms various routing protocols should employ to ensure interoperability
	 between disparate implementations.

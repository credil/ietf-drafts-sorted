Internet-Draft     Sec. Impl. of IPv6 on IPv4 networks          May 2013


1.  Introduction

   Most general-purpose operating systems implement and enable native
   IPv6 [RFC2460] support and a number of transition/co-existence
   technologies by default.  Support of IPv6 by all nodes is intended to
   become best current practice [RFC6540].  Some enterprise networks
   might, however, choose to delay active use of IPv6.  In scenarios in
   which the aforementioned devices are deployed on networks that are
   assumed to be IPv4-only, native IPv6 support and/or IPv6 transition/
   co-existence technologies could be leveraged by local or remote
   attackers for a number of (illegitimate) purposes.  For example,

   o  A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) might be prepared to
      detect attack patterns for IPv4 traffic, but might be unable to
      detect the same attack patterns when a transition/co-existence
      technology is leveraged for that purpose.

   o  An IPv4 firewall might enforce a specific security policy in IPv4,
      but might be unable to enforce the same policy in IPv6.

   o  A NIDS or firewall might support both IPv4 and IPv6, but might be
      not be configured to enforce on IPv6 traffic the same controls/
      policies it enforces on IPv4 traffic.

   o  Some transition/co-existence mechanisms could cause an internal
      host with otherwise limited IPv4 connectivity to become globally
      reachable over IPv6, therefore resulting in increased (and
      possibly unexpected) host exposure.

         Some transition/co-existence mechanisms (notably Teredo) are
         designed to traverse Network Address Port Translation (NAPT)
         [RFC2663] devices, allowing incoming IPv6 connections from the
         Internet to hosts behind the organizational firewall or NAPT
         (which in many deployments provides a minimum level of
         protection by only allowing those instances of communication
         that have been initiated from the internal network).

   o  IPv6 support could, either inadvertently or as a result of a
      deliberate attack, result in VPN traffic leaks if IPv6-unaware
      Virtual Private Network (VPN) software is employed by dual-stacked
      hosts [I-D.ietf-opsec-vpn-leakages].

   In general, most of the aforementioned security implications can be
   mitigated by enforcing security controls on native IPv6 traffic and
   on IPv4-tunneled IPv6 traffic.  Among such controls is the
   enforcement of filtering policies, to block undesirable traffic.
   While IPv6 widespread/global IPv6 deployment has been slower than
   expected, it is nevertheless happening; and thus, filtering IPv6

   traffic (whether native or transition/co-existence) to mitigate IPv6
   security implications on IPv4 networks should (generally) only be
   considered as a temporary measure until IPv6 is deployed.

      The aforementioned security controls should contemplate not only
      network-based solutions, but also host-based solutions (such as
      e.g. personal firewalls).

2.  Security Implications of Native IPv6 Support

   Most popular operating systems include IPv6 support that is enabled
   by default.  This means that even if a network is expected to be
   IPv4-only, much of its infrastructure is nevertheless likely to be
   IPv6 enabled.  For example, hosts are likely to have at least link-
   local IPv6 connectivity which might be exploited by attackers with
   access to the local network.

      [CORE2007] is a security advisory about a buffer overflow which
      could be remotely-exploited by leveraging link-local IPv6
      connectivity that is enabled by default.

   Additionally, unless appropriate measures are taken, an attacker with
   access to an 'IPv4-only' local network could impersonate a local
   router and cause local hosts to enable their 'non-link-local' IPv6
   connectivity (e.g. by sending Router Advertisement messages),
   possibly circumventing security controls that were enforced only on
   IPv4 communications.

      [THC-IPV6] and [IPv6-Toolkit] include tools that implement this
      attack vector (along with many others).

      [Waters2013] provides an example of how this could be achieved
      using publicly available tools.

   Native IPv6 support could also possibly lead to VPN traffic leakages
   when hosts employ VPN software that not only does not support IPv6,
   but that does nothing about IPv6 traffic.
   [I-D.ietf-opsec-vpn-leakages] describes this issue, along with
   possible mitigations.

   In general, networks should enforce on native IPv6 traffic the same
   security policies currently enforced on IPv4 traffic.  However, in
   those networks in which IPv6 has not yet been deployed, and enforcing
   the aforementioned policies is deemed as unfeasible, a network
   administrator might mitigate IPv6-based attack vectors by means of
   appropriate packet filtering.

2.1.  Filtering Native IPv6 Traffic

   Some layer-2 devices might have the ability to selectively filter
   packets based on the type of layer-2 payload.  When such
   functionality is available, IPv6 traffic could be blocked at those
   layer-2 devices by blocking, for example, Ethernet frames with the
   Protocol Type field set to 0x86dd [IANA-ETHER].

   SLAAC-based attacks [RFC3756] can be mitigated with technologies such



Gont & Liu              Expires November 3, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Sec. Impl. of IPv6 on IPv4 networks          May 2013


   as RA-Guard [RFC6105] [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ra-guard-implementation].  In a
   similar way, DHCPv6-based attacks can be mitigated with technologies
   such as DHCPv6-Shield [I-D.ietf-opsec-dhcpv6-shield].  However,
   neither RA-Guard nor DHCPv6-Shield can mitigate attack vectors that
   employ IPv6 link-local addresses, since configuration of such
   addresses does not rely on Router Advertisement messages or DCHPv6-
   server messages.

   Administrators considering the filtering of native IPv6 traffic at
   layer-3 devices are urged to pay attention to the general
   considerations for IPv6 traffic filtering discussed in Section 4.

      If native IPv6 traffic is filtered at layer-2, local IPv6 nodes
      would only get to configure IPv6 link-local addresses.

   In order to mitigate attacks based on native IPv6 traffic, IPv6
   security controls should be enforced on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
   The aforementioned controls might include: deploying IPv6-enabled
   NIDS, implementing IPv6 firewalling, etc.

      In some very specific scenarios (e.g., military operations
      networks) in which only IPv4 service might be desired, a network
      administrator might want to disable IPv6 support in all the
      communicating devices.

3.  Security Implications of Tunneling Mechanisms

   Unless properly managed, tunneling mechanisms might result in
   negative security implications.  For example, they might increase
   host exposure, might be leveraged to evade security controls, might
   contain protocol-based vulnerabilities, and/or the corresponding code
   might contain bugs with security implications.

      [RFC6169] describes the security implications of tunneling
      mechanisms in detail.

      Of the plethora of tunneling mechanisms that have so far been
      standardized and widely implemented, the so-called "automatic
      tunneling" mechanisms (such as Teredo, ISATAP, and 6to4) are of
      particular interest from a security standpoint, since they might
      be employed without prior consent or action of the user or network
      administrator.

   Tunneling mechanisms should be a concern not only to network
   administrators that have consciously deployed them, but also to those
   who have not deployed them, as these mechanisms might be leveraged to
   bypass their security policies.

      [CERT2009] contains some examples of how tunnels can be leveraged
      to bypass firewall rules.

   The aforementioned issues could be mitigated by applying the common
   security practice of only allowing traffic deemed as "necessary"
   (i.e., the so-called "default deny" policy).  Thus, when such policy
   is enforced, IPv6 transition/co-existence traffic would be blocked by
   default, and would only be allowed as a result of an explicit
   decision.

      It should be noted that this type of policy is usually enforced on
      a network that is the target of such traffic (such as an
      enterprise network).  IPv6 transition traffic should generally
      never be filtered e.g. by an ISP when it is transit traffic.

   In those scenarios in which transition/co-existence traffic is meant
   to be blocked, it is highly recommended that, in addition to the
   enforcement of filtering policies at the organizational perimeter,
   the corresponding transition/co-existence mechanisms be disabled on
   each node connected to the organizational network.  This would not
   only prevent security breaches resulting from accidental use of these
   mechanisms, but would also disable this functionality altogether,
   possibly mitigating vulnerabilities that might be present in the host
   implementation of these transition/co-existence mechanisms.

   IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnelling mechanisms (such as 6to4 or configured
   tunnels) can generally be blocked by dropping IPv4 packets that
   contain a Protocol field set to 41.  Security devices such as NIDS
   might also include signatures that detect such transition/
   co-existence traffic.

   Administrators considering the filtering of transition/co-existence
   traffic are urged to pay attention to the general considerations for
   IPv6 traffic filtering discussed in Section 4.

   We note that this document only covers standardized IPv6 tunneling
   mechanisms, but does not aim to cover non-standard tunneling
   mechanisms or IPsec-based [RFC4301] or SSL/TLS-based [RFC5246]
   [RFC6101] tunneling of IPv6 packets.

3.1.  Filtering 6in4

   Probably the most basic type of tunnel employed for connecting IPv6
   "islands" is the so-called "6in4", in which IPv6 packets are
   encapsulated within IPv4 packets.  These tunnels are typically result
   from manual configuration at the two tunnel endpoints.

   6in4 tunnels can be blocked by blocking IPv4 packets with a Protocol
   field of 41.

3.2.  Filtering 6over4

   [RFC2529] specifies a mechanism known as 6over4 or 'IPv6 over IPv4'
   (or colloquially as 'virtual Ethernet'), which comprises a set of
   mechanisms and policies to allow isolated IPv6 hosts located on
   physical links with no directly-connected IPv6 router, to become
   fully functional IPv6 hosts by using an IPv4 domain that supports
   IPv4 multicast as their virtual local link.

      This transition technology has never been widely deployed, because
      of the low level of deployment of multicast in most networks.

   6over4 encapsulates IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets with their Protocol
   field set to 41.  As a result, simply filtering all IPv4 packets that
   have a Protocol field equal to 41 will filter 6over4 (along with many
   other transition technologies).

   A more selective filtering could be enforced such that 6over4 traffic
   is filtered while other transition traffic is still allowed.  Such a
   filtering policy would block all IPv4 packets that have their
   Protocol field set to 41, and that have a Destination Address that
   belongs to the prefix 239.0.0.0/8.




Gont & Liu              Expires November 3, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Sec. Impl. of IPv6 on IPv4 networks          May 2013


   This filtering policy basically blocks 6over4 Neighbor Discovery
   traffic directed to multicast addresses, thus preventing Stateless
   Address Auto-configuration (SLAAC), address resolution, etc.
   Additionally, it would prevent the 6over multicast addresses from
   being leveraged for the purpose of network reconnaissance.

3.3.  Filtering 6rd

   6rd builds upon the mechanisms of 6to4 to enable the rapid deployment
   of IPv6 on IPv4 infrastructures, while avoiding some downsides of
   6to4.  Usage of 6rd was originally documented in [RFC5569], and the
   mechanism was generalized to other access technologies and formally
   standardized in [RFC5969].

   6rd can be blocked by blocking IPv4 packets with the Protocol field
   set to 41.

3.4.  Filtering 6to4

   6to4 [RFC3056] is an address assignment and router-to-router, host-
   to-router, and router-to-host automatic tunnelling mechanism that is
   meant to provide IPv6 connectivity between IPv6 sites and hosts
   across the IPv4 Internet.

      The security considerations for 6to4 are discussed in detail in
      [RFC3964].  [RFC6343] provides advice to network operators about
      6to4 (some of which relates to security mitigations).

   As discussed in Section 3, all IPv6-in-IPv4 traffic, including 6to4,
   could be easily blocked by filtering IPv4 that contain their Protocol
   field set to 41.  This is the most effective way of filtering such
   traffic.

   If 6to4 traffic is meant to be filtered while other IPv6-in-IPv4
   traffic is allowed, then more finer-grained filtering rules could be
   applied.  For example, 6to4 traffic could be filtered by applying
   filtering rules such as:

   o  Filter outgoing IPv4 packets that have the Destination Address set
      to an address that belongs to the prefix 192.88.99.0/24.

   o  Filter incoming IPv4 packets that have the Source Address set to
      an address that belongs to the prefix 192.88.99.0/24.

         These rules assume that the corresponding nodes employ the
         "Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" [RFC3068].

Internet-Draft     Sec. Impl. of IPv6 on IPv4 networks          May 2013


         It has been suggested that 6to4 relays send their packets with
         their IPv4 Source Address set to 192.88.99.1.

   o  Filter outgoing IPv4 packets that have the Destination Address set
      to the IPv4 address of well-known 6to4 relays.

   o  Filter incoming IPv4 packets that have the Source Address set to
      the IPv4 address of well-known 6to4 relays.

      These last two filtering policies will generally be unnecessary,
      and possibly unfeasible to enforce (given the number of potential
      6to4 relays, and the fact that many relays might remain unknown to
      the network administrator).  If anything, they should be applied
      with the additional requirement that such IPv4 packets have their
      Protocol field set to 41, to avoid the case where other services
      available at the same IPv4 address as a 6to4 relay are mistakenly
      made inaccessible.

   If the filtering device has capabilities to inspect the payload of
   IPv4 packets, then the following filtering rules could be enforced:

   o  Filter outgoing IPv4 packets that have their Protocol field set to
      41, and that have an IPv6 Source Address (embedded in the IPv4
      payload) that belongs to the prefix 2002::/16.

   o  Filter incoming IPv4 packets that have their Protocol field set to
      41, and that have an IPv6 Destination address (embedded in the
      IPv4 payload) that belongs to the prefix 2002::/16.

3.5.  Filtering ISATAP

   ISATAP [RFC5214] is an Intra-site tunnelling protocol, and thus it is
   generally expected that such traffic will not traverse the
   organizational firewall of an IPv4-only.  Nevertheless, ISATAP can be
   easily blocked by blocking IPv4 packets with a Protocol field of 41.

   The most popular operating system that includes an implementation of
   ISATAP in the default installation is Microsoft Windows.  Microsoft
   Windows obtains the ISATAP router address by resolving the domain
   name isatap.<localdomain> DNS A resource records.  Additionally, they
   try to learn the ISATAP router address by employing Link-local
   Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) [RFC4795] to resolve the name
   "isatap".  As a result, blocking ISATAP by preventing hosts from
   successfully performing name resolution for the aforementioned names
   and/or by filtering packets with specific IPv4 destination addresses
   is both difficult and undesirable.

Internet-Draft     Sec. Impl. of IPv6 on IPv4 networks          May 2013


3.6.  Filtering Teredo

   Teredo [RFC4380] is an address assignment and automatic tunnelling
   technology that provides IPv6 connectivity to dual-stack nodes that
   are behind one or more Network Address Port Translation (NAPT)
   [RFC2663] devices, by encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4-based UDP
   datagrams.  Teredo is meant to be a 'last resort' IPv6 connectivity
   technology, to be used only when other technologies such as 6to4
   cannot be deployed (e.g., because the edge device has not been
   assigned a public IPv4 address).

   As noted in [RFC4380], in order for a Teredo client to configure its
   Teredo IPv6 address, it must contact a Teredo server, through the
   Teredo service port (UDP port number 3544).

   To prevent the Teredo initialization process from succeeding, and
   hence prevent the use of Teredo, an organizational firewall could
   filter outgoing UDP packets with a Destination Port of 3544.

      It is clear that such a filtering policy does not prevent an
      attacker from running its own Teredo server in the public
      Internet, using a non-standard UDP port for the Teredo service
      port (i.e., a port number other than 3544).

   If the filtering device has capabilities to inspect the payload of
   IPv4 packets, the following (additional) filtering policy could be
   enforced:

   o  Filter outgoing IPv4/UDP packets that have that embed an IPv6
      packet with the "Version" field set to 6, and an IPv6 Source
      Address that belongs to the prefix 2001::/32.

   o  Filter incoming IPv4/UDP packets that have that embed an IPv6
      packet with the "Version" field set to 6, and an IPv6 Destination
      Address that belongs to the prefix 2001::/32.

      These two filtering rules could, at least in theory, result in
      false positives.  Additionally, they would generally require the
      filtering device to reassemble fragments prior to enforcing
      filtering rules, since the information required to enforce them
      might be missing in the received fragments (which should be
      expected if Teredo is being employed for malicious purposes).

   The most popular operating system that includes an implementation of
   Teredo in the default installation is Microsoft Windows.  Microsoft
   Windows obtains the Teredo server addresses (primary and secondary)
   by resolving the domain name teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com into DNS A
   records.  A network administrator might want to prevent Microsoft

Internet-Draft     Sec. Impl. of IPv6 on IPv4 networks          May 2013


   Windows hosts from obtaining Teredo service by filtering at the
   organizational firewall outgoing UDP datagrams (i.e.  IPv4 packets
   with the Protocol field set to 17) that contain in the IPv4
   Destination Address any of the IPv4 addresses that the domain name
   teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com maps to.  Additionally, the firewall would
   filter incoming UDP datagrams from any of the IPv4 addresses to which
   the domain names of well-known Teredo servers (such as
   teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com) resolve.

      As these IPv4 addresses might change over time, an administrator
      should obtain these addresses when implementing the filtering
      policy, and should also be prepared to keep this list up to date.

      The corresponding addresses can be easily obtained from a UNIX
      host by issuing the command 'dig teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com a'
      (without quotes).

      dig(1) is a free-software tool (part of the "dnsutils" package)
      produced by the Internet Software Consortium (ISC).

   It should be noted that even with all these filtering policies in
   place, a node in the internal network might still be able to
   communicate with some Teredo clients.  That is, it could configure an
   IPv6 address itself (without even contacting a Teredo server), and
   might send Teredo traffic to those peers for which intervention of
   the host's Teredo server is not required (e.g., Teredo clients behind
   a cone NAT).

3.7.  Filtering Tunnel Broker with Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP)

   The tunnel broker model enables dynamic configuration of tunnels
   between a tunnel client and a tunnel server.  The tunnel broker
   provides a control channel for creating, deleting or updating a
   tunnel between the tunnel client and the tunnel server.
   Additionally, the tunnel broker may register the user IPv6 address
   and name in the DNS.  Once the tunnel is configured, data can flow
   between the tunnel client and the tunnel server.  [RFC3053] describes
   the Tunnel Broker model, while [RFC5572] specifies the Tunnel Setup
   Protocol (TSP), which can be used by clients to communicate with the
   Tunnel Broker.

   TSP can use either TCP or UDP as the transport protocol.  In both
   cases TSP uses port number 3653, which has been assigned by the IANA
   for this purpose.  As a result, TSP (the Tunnel Broker control
   channel) can be blocked by blocking TCP and UDP packets originating
   from the local network and destined to UDP port 3653 or TCP port
   3653.  Additionally, the data channel can be blocked by blocking UDP
   packets originated from the local network and destined to UDP port

   3653, and IPv4 packets with a Protocol field set to 41.

3.8.  Filtering AYIYA

   AYIYA ("Anything In Anything") [I-D.massar-v6ops-ayiya] allows the
   tunnelling of packets across Network Address Port Translation (NAPT)
   [RFC2663] devices.  While the specification of this tunneling
   mechanism was never published as an RFC, it is nevertheless widely
   deployed [SixXS-stats].

   AYIYA can be blocked by blocking TCP and UDP packets originating from
   the local network and destined to UDP port 5072 or TCP port 5072.

4.  Additional Considerations when Filtering IPv6 Traffic

   IPv6 deployments in the Internet are continually increasing, and some
   hosts default to preferring IPv6 connectivity whenever it is
   available.  This is likely to cause IPv6-capable hosts to attempt to
   reach an ever-increasing number of popular destinations via IPv6,
   even if this IPv6 connectivity relies on a transition technology over
   an IPv4-only network.

   A large source of IPv6 brokenness today comes from nodes that believe
   that they have functional IPv6 connectivity, but the path to their
   destination fails somewhere upstream [Anderson2010] [Anderson2011]
   [Huston2010b] [Huston2012].  Upstream filtering of transition
   technologies or situations where a mis-configured node attempts to
   "provide" native IPv6 service on a given network without proper
   upstream IPv6 connectivity may result in hosts attempting to reach
   remote nodes via IPv6, and depending on the absence or presence and
   specific implementation details of "Happy Eyeballs" [RFC6555], there
   might be a non-trivial timeout period before the host falls back to
   IPv4 [Huston2010a] [Huston2012].

   For this reason, networks attempting to prevent IPv6 traffic from
   traversing their devices should consider configuring their local
   recursive DNS servers to respond to queries for AAAA DNS records with
   a DNS RCODE of 3 (NXDOMAIN) [RFC1035] or to silently ignore such
   queries, and should even consider filtering AAAA records at the
   network ingress point to prevent the internal hosts from attempting
   their own DNS resolution.  This will ensure that hosts which are on
   an IPv4-only network will only receive DNS A records, and they will
   be unlikely to attempt to use (likely broken) IPv6 connectivity to
   reach their desired destinations.

   Additionally, it should be noted that when filtering IPv6 traffic, it
   is good practice to signal the packet drop to the source node, such
   that it is able to react to the packet drop in a more appropriate and
   timely way.

      For example, a firewall could signal the packet drop by means of
      an ICMPv6 error message (or TCP [RFC0793] RST segment if
      appropriate), such that the source node can e.g. quickly react as
      described in [RFC5461].

      For obvious reasons, if the traffic being filtered is IPv6
      transition/co-existence traffic, the signalling packet should be
      sent by means of the corresponding IPv6 transition/co-existence
      technology.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses the security implications of IPv6 on IPv4
   networks, and describes a number of techniques to mitigate the
   aforementioned issues.  In general, the possible mitigations boil
   down to enforcing on native IPv6 and IPv6 transition/co-existence
   traffic the same security policies currently enforced for IPv4
   traffic, and/or blocking the aforementioned traffic when it is deemed
   as undesirable.

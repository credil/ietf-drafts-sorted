		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
			<t>
			The Internet is being recognized as a critical infrastructure similar in nature to
			the power grid and a potable water supply.  Just like those infrastructures, means are
			needed to provide resiliency and adaptability to the Internet so that it remains
			consistently available to the public throughout the world even during times of 
			duress or attack.  For this reason, many SDOs are
			developing standards with hopes of retaining an acceptable level, or even improving
			this availability, to its users.
			These SDO efforts usually define themselves as "security" efforts.  It is the opinion
			of the authors that there are many different definitions of the term "security" and
			it may be applied in many diverse ways.  As such, we offer no assurance that the
			term is applied consistently throughout this document.
			</t>

			<t>
			Many of these SDOs have diverse charters and goals and will take entirely different
			directions in their efforts to provide standards.  However, even with that, there
			will be overlaps in their produced works.  If there are overlaps then there is a
			potential for conflicts and confusion.  This may result in:
			<list>
				<t>
				Vendors of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard to follow.
				</t>
				<t>
				Purchasers of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard will
				best apply to the needs of their business or ogranization.
				</t>
				<t>
				Network Administrators and Operators unsure of which standard to follow
				to attain the best security for their network.
				</t>
			</list>
			For these reasons, the authors wish to encourage all SDOs who have an interest
			in producing or in consuming standards relating to good security practices to
			be consistent in their approach and their recommendations.  In many cases, the
			authors are aware that the SDOs are making good efforts along these lines.  
			However, the authors do not participate in all SDO efforts and cannot know 
			everything that is happening.

			The OpSec Working Group met at the 61st IETF and agreed that this document
			could be a useful reference in producing the documents described in the
			Working Group Charter.  The authors have agreed to keep this document current
			and request that those who read it will submit corrections or comments.

                        contains a listing of online glossaries relating to networking

			security and security events be consistent.  Inconsistencies between the useage
			of words on standards is unacceptable as it would prevent a reader of two 
			standards to appropriately relate their recommendations.  The authors of this
			document have not reviewed the definitions of the words in the listed glossaries
			so can offer no assurance of their alignment.

			The second part, <xref target="sdo" />, contains a listing of SDOs

				<t>
				Abstract: This standard contains a set of baseline security requirements for the 
				management plane.  The President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory 
				Committee Network Security Information Exchange (NSIE) and Government NSIE jointly 
				established a Security Requirements Working Group (SRWG) to examine the security 
				requirements for controlling access to the public switched network, in particular 
				with respect to the emerging next generation network.  In the telecommunications 
				industry, this access incorporates operation, administration, maintenance, and 
				provisioning for network elements and various supporting systems and databases.  
				Members of the SRWG, from a cross-section of telecommunications carriers and 
				vendors, developed an initial list of security requirements that would allow 
				vendors, government departments and agencies, and service providers to implement 
				a secure telecommunications network management infrastructure.  This initial list 
				of security requirements was submitted as a contribution to Committee 
				T1 - Telecommunications, Working Group T1M1.5 for consideration as a standard.  
				The requirements outlined in this document will allow vendors, government 
				departments and agencies, and service providers to implement a secure 
				telecommunications network management infrastructure.

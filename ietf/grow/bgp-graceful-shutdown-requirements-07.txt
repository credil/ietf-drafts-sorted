Abstract 
    
   The Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) is heavily used in Service Provider 
   networks both for Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services. For resiliency 
   purposes, redundant routers and BGP sessions can be deployed to 
   reduce the consequences of an AS Border Router or BGP session 
   breakdown on customers' or peers' traffic. However simply taking down 
   or even bringing up a BGP session for maintenance purposes may still 
   induce connectivity losses during the BGP convergence. This is not 
   satisfactory any more for new applications (e.g. voice over IP, on 
   line gaming, VPN). Therefore, a solution is required for the graceful 
   shutdown of a (set of) BGP session(s) in order to limit the amount of 
   traffic loss during a planned shutdown. This document expresses 
   requirements for such a solution.

Internet-Draft   Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
    
    
1. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   The Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) [RFC4271] is heavily used in Service 
   Provider networks both for Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services 
   [RFC4364]. For resiliency purposes, redundant routers and BGP 
   sessions can be deployed to reduce the consequences of an AS Border 
   Router or BGP session breakdown on customers' or peers' traffic. 
    
   We place ourselves in the context where a Service Provider performs a 
   maintenance operation and needs to shut down one or multiple BGP 
   peering link(s) or a whole ASBR. If an alternate path is available 
   within the AS, the requirement is to avoid or reduce customer or peer 
   traffic loss during the BGP convergence. Indeed, as an alternate path 
   is available in the Autonomous System (AS), it should be made 
   possible to reroute the customer or peer traffic on this backup path 
   before the BGP session(s) is/are torn down, the nominal path is 
   withdrawn and the forwarding is stopped. 
    
   The requirements also cover the subsequent re-establishment of the 
   BGP session as even this "UP" case can currently trigger route loss 
   and thus traffic loss at some routers. 
    
   BGP [RFC4271] and MP-BGP [RFC4760] do not currently have a mechanism 
   to gracefully migrate traffic from one BGP next hop to another 
   without interrupting the flow of traffic. When a BGP session is taken 
   down, BGP behaves as if it was a sudden link or router failure and 
   withdraws the prefixes learnt over that session, which may trigger 
   traffic loss. There is no mechanism to advertise to its BGP peers 
   that the prefix will soon be unreachable, while still being 
   reachable. When applicable, such mechanism would reduce or prevent 
   traffic loss. It would typically be applicable in case of a 
   maintenance operation requiring the shutdown of a forwarding 
   resource. Typical examples would be a link or line card maintenance, 
   replacement or upgrade. It may also be applicable for a software 
   upgrade as it may involve a firmware reset on the line cards and 
   hence forwarding interruption. 
   The introduction of Route Reflectors as per [RFC4456] to solve 
   scalability issues bound to IBGP full-meshes has worsened the 
   duration of routing convergence as some route reflectors may hide the 
   back up path. Thus depending on RR topology more IBGP hops may be 
   involved in the IBGP convergence.

Internet-Draft   Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
   Note that these planned maintenance operations cannot be addressed by 
   Graceful Restart extensions [RFC4724] as GR only applies when the 
   forwarding is preserved during the control plane restart. On the 
   contrary, Graceful Shutdown applies when the forwarding is 
   interrupted. 
   Note also that some protocols are already considering such graceful 
   shutdown procedure (e.g. GMPLS in [RFC5817]). 
    
   A metric of success is the degree to which such a mechanism 
   eliminates traffic loss during maintenance operations. 
    
3. Problem statement 
    
   As per [RFC4271], when one (or many) BGP session(s) are shut down, a 
   BGP NOTIFICATION message is sent to the peer and the session is then 
   closed. A protocol convergence is then triggered both by the local 
   router and by the peer. Alternate paths to the destination are 
   selected, if known. If those alternates paths are not known prior to 
   the BGP session shutdown, additional BGP convergence steps are 
   required in each AS to search for an alternate path. 
    
   This behavior is not satisfactory in a maintenance situation because 
   the traffic that was directed towards the removed next-hops may be 
   lost until the end of the BGP convergence. As it is a planned 
   operation, a make before break solution should be made possible. 
    
   As maintenance operations are frequent in large networks [Reliable], 
   the global availability of the network is significantly impaired by 
   this BGP maintenance issue. 
    
3.1. Example of undesirable BGP routing behavior 
    
   To illustrate these problems, let us consider the following simple 
   example where one customer router "CUST" is dual-attached to two SP 
   routers "ASBR1" and "ASBR2". 
   ASBR1 and ASBR2 are in the same AS and owned by the same service 
   provider. Both are IBGP client of the route reflector R1.

   Before the maintenance, packets for destination Z/z use the ASBR1-
   CUST link because R1 selects ASBR1's route based on the IGP cost. 
    
   Let's assume the service provider wants to shutdown the ASBR1-CUST 
   link for maintenance purposes. Currently, when the shutdown is 
   performed on ASBR1, the following steps are performed: 
     1.  ASBR1 withdraw its prefix Z/z to its route reflector R1. 
     2. R1 runs its decision process, selects the route from ASBR2 and 
        advertises the new path to ASBR1. 
     3. ASBR1 runs its decision process and recovers the reachability of 
        Z/z. 
    
   Traffic is lost between step 1 when ASBR1 looses its route and step 3 
   when it discovers a new path. 
    
   Note that this is a simplified description for illustrative purpose. 
   In a bigger AS, multiple steps of BGP convergence may be required to 
   find and select the best alternate path (e.g. ASBR1 is chosen based 
   on a higher local pref, hierarchical route reflectors are used...). 
   When multiple BGP routers are involved and plenty of prefixes are 
   affected, the recovery process can take longer than applications 
   requirements. 
    
3.2. Causes of packet loss 
    
   The loss of packets during the maintenance has two main causes: 
   - lack of an alternate path on some routers, 
   - transient routing inconsistency.

Internet-Draft   Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
   Some routers may lack an alternate path because another router is 
   hiding the backup path. This router can be: 
   - a route reflector only propagating its best path; 
   - the backup ASBR not advertising the backup path because it prefers 
     the nominal path. 
   This lack of knowledge of the alternate path is the first target of 
   this requirement draft. 
    
   Transient routing inconsistencies happen during IBGP convergence 
   because routers do not simultaneously update their RIBs and hence do 
   not simultaneously update their FIBs entries. This can lead to 
   forwarding loops which result in both link congestion and packet 
   drops. The duration of these transient micro-loops is dependent on 
   the IBGP topology (e.g. number of Route Reflectors between ingress 
   and egress ASBR), implementation differences among router platforms 
   which result in differences in the time taken to update specific 
   prefix in the FIB, forwarding mode (hop by hop IP forwarding versus 
   tunneling). 
    
   Note that when an IP lookup is only performed on entry to the AS, for 
   example prior to entry into a tunnel across the AS, micro-loops will 
   not occur. An example of this is when BGP is being used to as the 
   routing protocol for MPLS VPN as defined in [RFC4364]. 
   Note that [RFC5715] defines a framework for loop-free convergence. It 
   has been written in the context of IP Fast ReRoute for link state IGP 
   [RFC5714] but some concepts are also of interest for BGP convergence. 
    
4. Terminology 
    
   g-shut: Graceful SHUTdown. A method for explicitly notifying the BGP 
   routers that a BGP session (and hence the prefixes learnt over that 
   session) is going to be disabled. 
    
   g-noshut: Graceful NO SHUTdown. A method for explicitly notifying 
   the BGP routers that a BGP session (and hence the prefixes learnt 
   over that session) is going to be enabled. 
    
   g-shut initiator: the router on which the session(s) shutdown is 
   (are) performed for the maintenance. 
    
   g-shut neighbor: a router that peers with the g-shut initiator 
   via (one of) the session(s) undergoing maintenance. 
    
   Affected prefixes: a prefix initially reached via the peering 
   link(s) undergoing maintenance. 
    
   Affected router: a router reaching an affected prefix via a 
   peering link undergoing maintenance. 
    
   Initiator AS: the autonomous system of the g-shut initiator 
   router.

Internet-Draft   Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
    
   Neighbor AS(es): the autonomous system(s) of the g-shut neighbor 
   router(s). 
    
5. Goals and requirements 
    
   Currently, when a BGP session of the router under maintenance is shut 
   down, the router removes the routes and then triggers the BGP 
   convergence on its BGP peers by withdrawing its route. 
   The goal of BGP graceful shutdown of a (set of) BGP session(s) is to 
   minimize traffic loss during a planned shutdown. Ideally a solution 
   should reduce this traffic loss to zero. 
   Another goal is to minimize and preferably to eliminate packet loss 
   when the BGP session is re-established following the maintenance. 
    
   As the event is known in advance, a make before break solution can be 
   used in order to initiate the BGP convergence, find and install the 
   alternate paths before the nominal paths are removed. As a result, 
   before the nominal BGP session is shut down, all affected routers 
   learn and use the alternate paths. Those alternate paths are computed 
   by BGP taking into account the known status of the network which 
   includes known failures that the network is processing concurrently 
   with the BGP session graceful shutdown and possibly known other 
   graceful shutdown under way. Therefore multiple BGP graceful 
   shutdowns overlapping within a short timeframe are gracefully 
   handled. Indeed a given graceful shutdown takes into account all 
   previous ones and previous graceful shutdown are given some time to 
   adapt to this new one. Then the nominal BGP session can be shut down. 
    
   As a result, provided an alternate path with enough remaining 
   capacity is available, the packets are rerouted before the BGP 
   session termination and fewer packets (possibly none) are lost during 
   the BGP convergence process since at any time, all routers have a 
   valid path. 
    
    
   From the above goals we can derive the following requirements: 
    
   a)   A mechanism to advertise the maintenance action to all affected 
   routers is REQUIRED. Such mechanism may be either implicit or 
   explicit. Note that affected routers can be located both in the local 
   AS and in neighboring ASes. Note also that the maintenance action can 
   either be the shutdown of a BGP session or the establishment of a BGP 
   session.  
   The mechanism SHOULD allow BGP routers to minimize and preferably to 
   eliminate packet loss when a path is removed or advertised. In 
   particular, it SHOULD be ensured that the old path is not removed 
   from the routing tables of the affected routers before the new path 
   is known. 
   The solution mechanism MUST significantly reduce and ideally

Internet-Draft   Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
   eliminate packet loss. A trade off may be made between the degree of 
   packet loss and the simplicity of the solution. 
    
   b)   An Internet wide convergence is OPTIONAL. However if the 
   initiator AS and the neighbor AS(es) have a backup path, they SHOULD 
   be able to gracefully converge before the nominal path is shut down. 
    
   c)   The proposed solution SHOULD be applicable to any kind of BGP 
   sessions (EBGP, IBGP, IBGP route reflector client, EBGP 
   confederations, EBGP multi hop, MultiProtocol BGP extension...) and 
   any address family. If a BGP implementation allows closing or 
   enabling a sub-set of AFIs carried in a MP-BGP session, this 
   mechanism MAY be applicable to this sub-set of AFIs. 
    
   Depending on the kind of session, there may be some variations in the 
   proposed solution in order to fulfill the requirements. 
    
   The following cases should be handled in priority: 
   - The shutdown of an inter-AS link and therefore the shutdown of an 
   eBGP session; 
   - The shutdown of an AS Border Router and therefore the shutdown of 
   all its BGP sessions. 
    
   Service Providers and platforms implementing a graceful shutdown 
   solution should note that in BGP/MPLS VPN as per [RFC4364], the PE-CE 
   routing can be performed by other protocols than BGP (e.g. static 
   routes, RIPv2, OSPF, IS-IS). This is out of scope of this document. 
    
   d)   The proposed solution SHOULD NOT change the BGP convergence 
   behavior for the ASes exterior to the maintenance process, namely 
   ASes other than the initiator AS and it(s) neighbor AS(es). 
    
   e)   An incremental deployment on a per AS or per BGP session basis 
   MUST be made possible. In case of partial deployment the proposed 
   solution SHOULD incrementally improve the maintenance process. 
   It should be noted that in an inter domain relation, one AS may have 
   more incentive to use graceful shutdown than the other. Similarly, in 
   a BGP/MPLS VPN environment, it's much easier to upgrade the PE 
   routers than the CE mainly because there is at least an order of 
   magnitude more CE and CE locations than PE and PE locations. As a 
   consequence, when splitting the cost of the solution between the g-
   shut initiator and the g-shut neighbour the solution SHOULD favour a 
   low cost solution on the neighbour AS side in order to reduce the 
   impact on the g-shut neighbour. Impact should be understood as a 
   generic term which includes first hardware, then software, then 
   configuration upgrade. 
    
   f)   Redistribution or advertisement of (static) IP routes into BGP 
   SHOULD also be covered.

Internet-Draft   Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
   g)   The proposed solution MAY be designed in order to avoid 
   transient forwarding loops. Indeed, forwarding loops increase packet 
   transit delay and may lead to link saturation. 
    
   h)   The specific procedure SHOULD end when the BGP session is closed 
   following the g-shut and once the BGP session is gracefully opened 
   following the g-noshut. In the end, once the planned maintenance is 
   finished the nominal BGP routing MUST be reestablished. 
   The duration of the g-shut procedure, and hence the time before the 
   BGP session is safely closed SHOULD be discussed by the solution 
   document. Examples of possible solutions are the use of a pre-
   configured timer, of a message to signal the end of the BGP 
   convergence or monitoring the traffic on the g-shut interface. 
 
   i)   The solution SHOULD be simple and simple to operate. Hence it 
   MAY only cover a subset of the cases. As a consequence, most of the 
   above requirements are expressed as "SHOULD" rather than "MUST". 
    
    
   The metrics to evaluate and compare the proposed solutions are: 
   - The duration of the remaining loss of connectivity when the BGP 
   session is brought down or up; 
   - The applicability to a wide range of BGP and network topologies; 
   - The simplicity; 
   - The duration of transient forwarding loops; 
   - The additional load introduced in BGP (e.g. BGP messages sent to 
   peer routers, peer ASes, the Internet). 
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   At the requirements stage, this graceful shutdown mechanism is 
   expected to not affect the security of the BGP protocol, especially 
   if it can be kept simple. No new sessions are required and the 
   additional ability to signal the graceful shutdown is not expected to 
   bring additional attack vector as BGP neighbors already have the 
   ability to send incorrect or misleading information or even shut down 
   the session. 
    
   Security considerations MUST be addressed by the proposed 
   solutions. In particular they SHOULD address the issues of bogus 
   g-shut messages and how they would affect the network(s), as well 
   as the impact of hiding a g-shut message so that g-shut is not 
   performed. 
    
   The solution SHOULD NOT increase the ability for one AS to 
   selectively influence routing decision in the peer AS (inbound 
   Traffic Engineering) outside the case of the BGP session 
   shutdown. Otherwise, the peer AS SHOULD have means to detect such

Internet-Draft   Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
    
 
10.     Appendix: Reference BGP Topologies 
    
   This section describes some frequent BGP topologies used both within 
   the AS (IBGP) and between ASes (EBGP). Solutions should be applicable 
   to the following topologies and their combinations. 
    
10.1.   EBGP topologies 
    
   This section describes some frequent BGP topologies used between 
   ASes. In each figure, a line represents a BGP session. 
    
10.1.1. 1 ASBR in AS1 connected to two ASBRs in the neighboring AS2 
    
   In this topology we have an asymmetric protection scheme between 
   AS1 and AS2: 
   - On AS2 side, two different routers are used to connect to AS1. 
   - On AS1 side, one single router with two BGP sessions is used.

                  /       '                  
               ASBR1.1    '                
                  \       '

                          '  
                                       
   Figure 2. EBGP topology with redundant ASBR in one of the AS. 
    
   BGP graceful shutdown is expected to be applicable for the 
   maintenance of: 
   - one of the routers of AS2; 
   - one link between AS1 and AS2, performed either on an AS1 or AS2 
     router. 
    
   Note that in case of maintenance of the whole router, all its BGP 
   sessions need to be gracefully shutdown at the beginning of the 
   maintenance and gracefully brought up at the end of the 
   maintenance.

10.1.2. 2 ASBRs in AS1 connected to 2 ASBRs in AS2 
    
   In this topology we have a symmetric protection scheme between 
   AS1 and AS2: on both sides, two different routers are used to 
   connect AS1 to AS2.

   BGP graceful shutdown is expected to be applicable for the 
   maintenance of:

   - one link between AS1 and AS2 performed either on an AS1 or AS2 
     router.

Internet-Draft   Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
   As the requirements expressed in section 5 is to advertise the 
   maintenance only within the initiator and neighbor ASes, but not 
   Internet wide, BGP graceful shutdown solutions may not be 
   applicable to this topology. Depending on which routes are 
   exchanged between these ASes, some protection for some of the 
   traffic may be possible. 
    
   For instance if ASBR2.2 performs a maintenance affecting ASBR3.1 then 
   ASBR3.1 will be notified. However ASBR1.1 may not be notified of the 
   maintenance of the eBGP session between ASBR3.1 and ASBR2.2. 
    
10.2.   IBGP topologies 
    
   This section describes some frequent BGP topologies used within an 
   AS. In each figure, a line represents a BGP session. 
    
10.2.1. IBGP Full-Mesh 
    
   In this topology we have a full mesh of IBGP sessions: 
    
                  P1 ----- P2 
                  | \    / | 
                  |  \  /  | 
                  |   \/   |     AS1 
                  |   /\   | 
                  |  /  \  | 
                  | /    \ | 
                ASBR1.1--ASBR1.2 
                   \       / 
                    \     / 
               ''''''\'''/'''''''''''' 
                      \ /      AS2 
                     ASBR2.1 
    
       Figure 5. IBGP full mesh 
    
   When the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 is gracefully 
   shutdown, it is required that all affected routers of AS1 reroute 
   traffic to ASBR1.2 before the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 
   is shut down. 
   Similarly, when the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 is 
   gracefully brought up, all affected routers of AS1 preferring 
   ASBR1.1 over ASBR1.2 need to reroute traffic to ASBR1.1 before the 
   less preferred path through ASBR1.2 is possibly withdrawn. 
    
10.2.2. Route Reflector 
    
   In this topology, route reflectors are used to limit the number of 
   IBGP sessions. There is a single level of route reflectors and the 
   route reflectors are fully meshed.

                      ASBR2.1 
    
       Figure 6. Route Reflector 
    
   When the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 is gracefully 
   shutdown, all BGP routers of AS1 need to reroute traffic to 
   ASBR1.2 before the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 is shut 
   down. 
   Similarly, when the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 is 
   gracefully brought up, all affected routers of AS1 preferring 
   ASBR1.1 over ASBR1.2 need to reroute traffic to ASBR1.1 before the 
   less preferred path through ASBR1.2 is possibly withdrawn. 
    
10.2.3. hierarchical Route Reflector 
    
   In this topology, hierarchical route reflectors are used to limit 
   the number of IBGP sessions. There could me more than two levels 
   of route reflectors and the top level route reflectors are fully 
   meshed.

       Figure 7. Hierarchical Route Reflector 
    
   When the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 is gracefully 
   shutdown, all BGP routers of AS1 need to reroute traffic to 
   ASBR1.2 before the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 is shut 
   down. 
   Similarly, when the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 is 
   gracefully brought up, all affected routers of AS1 preferring 
   ASBR1.1 over ASBR1.2 need to reroute traffic to ASBR1.1 before the 
   less preferred path through ASBR1.2 is possibly withdrawn. 
    
10.2.4. Confederations 
    
   In this topology, a confederation of ASs is used to limit the number 
   of IBGP sessions. Moreover, RRs may be present in the member ASs of 
   the confederation.  
   Confederations may be run with different sub-options. Regarding the 
   IGP, each member AS can run its own IGP or they can all share the 
   same IGP. Regarding BGP, local_pref may or may not cross the member 
   AS boundaries. 
   A solution should support the graceful shutdown and graceful bring up 
   of EBGP sessions between member-ASs in the confederation in addition 
   to the graceful shutdown and graceful bring up of EBGP sessions 
   between a member-AS and an AS outside of the confederation.

       Figure 8. Confederation 
    
   In the above figure, member-AS AS1A, AS1B, AS1C belong to a 
   confederation of ASes in AS1. AS1A and AS1B are connected to AS2. 
    
   In normal operation, for the traffic toward AS2,  
   . AS1A sends the traffic directly to AS2 through ASBR1A.1 
   . AS1B sends the traffic directly to AS2 through ASBR1B.1 
   . AS1C load balances the traffic between AS1A and AS1B 
    
   When the session between ASBR1A.1 and ASBR2.1 is gracefully shutdown, 
   all BGP routers of AS1 need to reroute traffic to ASBR1B.1 before the 
   session between ASBR1A.1 and ASBR2.1 is shut down. 
   Similarly, when the session between ASBR1A.1 and ASBR2.1 is 
   gracefully brought up, all affected routers of AS1 preferring 
   ASBR1A.1 over ASBR1.2 need to reroute traffic to ASBR1A.1 before the 
   less preferred path through ASBR1.2 is possibly withdrawn. 
    
10.3.   Routing decisions 
    
   We describe here some routing engineering choices that are 
   frequently used in ASes and that should be supported by the 
   solution.

   local LOCAL_PREF value set and advertised by the exit point. 
    
10.3.3. Cold potato (BGP preference set on ingress) 
    
   Ingress router selects the nominal egress ASBR based on 
   preconfigured policy information. (Typically by locally setting 
   the BGP local pref based on the BGP communities attached on the 
   routes). 
   As per [RFC4271], note that if tunnels are not used to forward 
   packets between ingress and egress ASBR, this can lead to 
   persistent forwarding loops.

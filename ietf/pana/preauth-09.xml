         This document defines an extension to the Protocol for
         carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) for
         proactively establishing a PANA security association between a
         PANA client in one access network and a PANA authentication

      <t>
        The Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access
        (PANA) <xref target='RFC5191'/> carries EAP messages between a
        PaC (PANA Client) and a PAA (PANA Authentication Agent) in the
        access network.  If the PaC is a mobile device and is capable
        of moving from one access network to another while running its
        applications, it is critical for the PaC to perform a handover
        seamlessly without degrading the performance of the
        applications during the handover period.  When the handover
        requires the PaC to establish a PANA session with the PAA in
        the new access network, the signaling to establish the PANA
        session should be completed as fast as possible.  See <xref
        target='I-D.ietf-hokey-preauth-ps'/> for the handover latency
        requirements.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines an extension to the PANA protocol <xref
        target='RFC5191'/> used for proactively executing EAP
        authentication and establishing a PANA SA (Security
        Association) between a PaC in an access network and a PAA in
        another access network to which the PaC may move.  The
        extension to the PANA protocol is designed to realize direct
        pre-authentication defined in <xref
        target='I-D.ietf-hokey-preauth-ps'/>.  How to realize
        authorization and accounting with the use of the
        pre-authentication extension is out of the scope of this
        document.

        The following terms are used in this document in addition to

      </t>
      <list style='hanging'>
        <t hangText='Serving Network:'>
          The access network to which the host is currently attached.
        </t>
        <t hangText='Candidate Network:'>
          An access network that is a potential target of host's
          handover.
        </t>
        <t hangText='Serving PAA (SPAA):'>
            A PAA that resides in the serving network and provides
            network access authentication for a particular PaC.
        </t>
        <t hangText='Candidate PAA (CPAA):'>
            A PAA that resides in a candidate network to which the
            PaC may move.  A CPAA for a particular PaC may be a SPAA
            for another PaC.
        </t>
        <t hangText='Pre-authentication:'>
           Pre-authentication refers to EAP pre-authentication and
           defined as the utilization of EAP to pre-establish EAP
           keying material on an authenticator prior to arrival of the
           peer at the access network served by that authenticator
           <xref target='I-D.ietf-hokey-preauth-ps'/>.  In this draft,
           EAP pre-authentication is performed between a PaC and a
           CPAA.
        </t>
      </list>
    </section>
    <section anchor='section-pre-authentication'
      title='Pre-authentication Procedure'>
      <t>
        A PaC that supports pre-authentication may establish a PANA
        session for each CPAA.
      </t>
      <t>
        There may be several mechanisms for a PaC to discover a CPAA.
        An IP address of the discovered CPAA is the output of those
        mechanisms.  PANA pre-authentication is performed between the
        PaC and CPAA using the discovered IP address of the CPAA. 
        IEEE 802.21 <xref target='802.21'/> Information Service MAY be
        used as a CPAA discovery mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        There may be a number of criteria for CPAA selection, the
        timing to start pre-authentication and the timing as to when
        the CPAA becomes the SPAA.  Such criteria can be
        implementation specific and thus are outside the scope of this
        document.
      </t>
      <t>
        Pre-authentication is initiated by a PaC in a similar way as
        normal authentication.  A new 'E' (prE-authentication) bit is
        defined in the PANA header.  When pre-authentication is
        performed, the 'E' (prE-authentication) bit of PANA messages
        is set in order to indicate that this PANA run is for
        pre-authentication.  Use of pre-authentication is negotiated
        as follows.
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            When a PaC initiates pre-authentication, it sends a
            PANA-Client-Initiation (PCI) message with the 'E'
            (prE-authentication) bit set.  The CPAA responds with a
            PANA-Auth-Request (PAR) message with the 'S' (Start) and
            'E' (prE-authentication) bits set only if it supports
            pre-authentication.  Otherwise, the 'E'
            (prE-authentication) bit of the PAR message will be
            cleared according to Section 6.2 of <xref
            target='RFC5191'/>, which results in a negotiation
            failure.
          </t>
          <t>
            Once the PaC and CPAA have successfully negotiated on
            performing pre-authentication using the 'S' (Start) and
            'E' (prE-authentication) bits, the subsequent PANA
            messages exchanged between them MUST have the 'E'
            (prE-authentication) bit set until CPAA becomes SPAA of
            the PaC.  The PaC may conduct this exchange with more than
            one CPAA.  If the PaC and CPAA have failed to negotiate on
            performing pre-authentication, the PaC or CPAA that sent a
            message with both the 'S' (Start) and 'E'
            (prE-authentication) bits set MUST discard the message
            received from the peer with 'S' (Start) bit set and the
            'E' (prE-authentication) bit cleared, which will
            eventually result in PANA session termination.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t> 
      <t>
        If IP reconfiguration is needed in the access network
        associated with the CPAA, the 'I' (IP Reconfiguration) bit in
        PAR messages used for pre-authentication between the PaC and
        CPAA is also set.  The 'I' (IP Reconfiguration) bit in these
        messages takes effect only after the CPAA becomes the SPAA.
      </t>
      <t>
        When a CPAA of the PaC becomes the SPAA due to, e.g., movement
        of the PaC, the PaC informs the PAA of the change using
        PANA-Notification-Request (PNR) and PANA-Notification-Answer
        (PNA) messages with the 'P' (Ping) bit set and the 'E'
        (prE-authentication) bit cleared.  The 'E'
        (prE-authentication) bit MUST be cleared in subsequent PANA
        messages.
      </t>
      <t>
        A PANA SA is required for pre-authentication in order to
        securely associate the PNR/PNA exchange to the earlier
        authentication.
      </t>
      <t>
        The PANA session between the PaC and a CPAA is deleted by
        entering the termination phase of the PANA protocol.

         Backward compatibility between a PANA entity that does not
         support the pre-authentication extension and another PANA
         entity that supports the pre-authentication extension is
         maintained as follows.
      </t>
      <t>
         When a PaC that supports the pre-authentication extension
         initiates PANA pre-authentication by sending a PCI message
         with the 'E' (prE-authentication) bit set to a PAA that does
         not support the pre-authentication extension, the PAA will
         ignore the E-bit according to Section 6.2 of <xref
         target='RFC5191'/>, and try to process the message as a
         normal authentication attempt.  As a result, the PaC will
         receive a PAR message with the 'E' (prE-authentication) bit
         cleared.  In this case, the negotiation on the use of
         pre-authentication will fail and eventually the PANA session
         will be terminated as described in Section <xref
         target='section-pre-authentication'/>.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Security Considerations'>
    <t>
      This specification is based on the PANA protocol and it exhibits
      the same security properties, except for one important
      difference: Pre- authenticating PaCs are not physically
      connected to an access network associated with the PAA, but they
      are connected to some other network somewhere else on the
      Internet.  This distinction can create greater DoS vulnerability
      for systems using PANA pre-authentication if appropriate
      measures are not taken.  An unprotected PAA can be forced to
      create state by an attacker PaC which merely sends PCI messages.
    </t>
    <t> 
      <xref target='RFC5191'/> describes how PAA can stay stateless
      while responding to incoming PCIs.  PAAs using
      pre-authentication SHOULD be following those guidelines (see
      <xref target='RFC5191'/> Section 4.1).
    </t>
    <t>
      Furthermore, it is recommended that PANA pre-authentication
      messages are only accepted from PaCs originating from well-known
      IP networks (e.g., physically adjacent networks) for a given
      PAA. These IP networks can be used with a white-list implemented
      either on the firewall protecting the perimeter around the PAA,
      or on the PAA itself. This prevention measure SHOULD be used
      whenever it can be practically applied to a given deployment.
    </t>
    </section>
    <section title='IANA Considerations'>
      <t>
        As described in <xref target='section-pana-extensions'/> and
        following the new IANA allocation policy on PANA message <xref
        target='I-D.arkko-pana-iana'/>, bit 6 of the Flags field of
        the PANA Header needs to be assigned by IANA for the 'E'
        (prE-authentication) bit.

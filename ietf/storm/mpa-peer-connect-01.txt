                  draft-ietf-storm-mpa-peer-connect-01

Abstract

   Extensions to MPA are specified for RDMA Connection establishment.
   The first extension extends RFC5043, enabling peer-to-peer connection
   establishment over MPA/TCP.  The second extension extends both
   RFC5043 and RFC5044, by providing an option for standardized exchange
   of RDMA-layer connection configuration.

Internet-Draft   Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment    February 2010


1.  Introduction

   When used over TCP, the current RDDP suite of protocols relies on MPA
   RFC 5044 [RFC5044] protocol for both connection establishment and for
   markers for TCP layering.  Currently MPA only supports a client-
   server model for connection establishment, forcing peer-to-peer
   applications to interact as though they had a client/server
   relationship.  In addition negotiation of some of RDMAP RFC 5040
   [RFC5040] specific parameters are left to ULP negotiation.  Providing
   an optional ULP-independent format for exchanging these parameters
   would be of benefit to transport neutral RDMA applications.

1.1.  Summary of changes from RFC 5044

   This draft extends RFC 5044 [RFC5044] MPA connection setup protocol.
   First, it add exchange and negotiation of maximum number of RDMA Read
   Incoming (IRD) and Outgoing messages (ORD).  Second, it adds one more
   Ready to Receive (RTR) frame from requestor to responder as the last
   message of connection establishment and adds negotiation of RTR frame
   message type into MPA request/response frames.

1.2.  Summary of changes from RFC 5043

   This draft extends RFC 5043 [RFC5043] by adding new Enhanced Session
   Control Chunks that extend the currently defined Chunks with the
   addition of IRD and ORD negotiation.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

   FULPDU:  Framed Upper Layer Protocol PDU.  See [RFC5044].

   Completion Queue (CQ):  A consumer accessible queue where the RDMA
      device reports completions of Work Requests.  A Consumer is able
      to reap completions from a CQ without requiring per transaction
      support from the kernel or other privileged entity.  See [RDMAC]

   Completion Queue Entry (CQE):  Transport and device specific
      representation of a Work Completion.  A Completion Queue holds
      CQEs.  See [RDMAC]

Internet-Draft   Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment    February 2010


   Inbound RDMA Read Queue Depth (IRD):  The maximum number of incoming
      outstanding RDMA Read Request Messages an RDMA connection can
      handle.  See [RDMAC]

   IRD:  See Inbound RDMA Read Queue Depth.

   ORD:  See Outbound RDMA Read Queue Depth.

   Outbound RDMA Read Queue Depth (ORD):  The maximum number of
      outstanding RDMA Read Requests that can be issued for the RDMA
      connection.  This should be less than or equal to the peer's IRD.
      See [RDMAC]

   Queue Pair (QP):  The traditional name for a local Endpoint in a
      [VIA] derived local interface.  A Queue Pair is the set of Work
      Queues associated exclusively with a single Endpoint.  The Send
      Queue (SQ), Receive Queue (RQ) and Inbound RDMA Read Queue (IRQ)
      are considered to be part of the Queue Pair.  The potentially
      shared Completion Queue (CQ) and Shared Receive Queue (SRQ) are
      not.  See [RDMAC].

   Shared Receive Queue(SRQ):  A shared pool of Receive Work Requests
      posted by the Consumer that can be allocated by multiple RDMA
      endpoints (Queue Pair).  See [DAPL].

   Work Queue:  An element of a [VIA] derived local interface that
      allows user-space applications to submit Work Requests directly to
      network hardware.  Specific Work Queues include the Send Queue
      (SQ) for transmit requests, Receive Queue (RQ) for receive
      requests specific to a single Endpoint and Shared Receive Queues
      (SRQs) for receive requests that can be allocated by one or more
      Endpoints.  See [RDMAC].

   Work Queue Element (WQE):  Transport and device specific
      representation of a Work Request.  See [RDMAC].

   Work Request:  An elementary object used by Consumers to enqueue a
      requested operation (WQEs) onto a Work Queue.  See [RDMAC].


4.  Motivations

   The goal of this draft is twofold.  One is to extend support from the
   current client-server model for RDMA connection setup to a peer-to-
   peer model.  The second is to add negotiation of RDMA Read queue size
   for both sides of an RDMA connection.

Internet-Draft   Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment    February 2010


4.1.  Enabling MPA Mode

   MPA defines encoding of DDP Segments in FULPDUs (Framed Upper Layer
   Protocol PDUs).  Generation of FULPDUs requires the ability to
   periodically insert MPA Markers and to generate the MPA CRC-32c for
   each frame.  Reception may require parsing/removing the markers after
   using them to identify MPA Frame boundaries, and validation of the
   MPA-CRC32c.

   A major design objective for MPA was to ensure that the resulting TCP
   stream would be a fully compliant TCP stream for any and all TCP-
   aware middle-boxes.  The challenge is that while only some TCP
   payload streams are a valid stream of MPA FULPDUs, any sequence of
   bytes is a valid TCP payload stream.  The determination that a given
   stream is in a specific MPA mode cannot be made at the MPA or TCP
   layer.  Therefore enabling of MPA mode is handled by the ULP.

   The MPA protocol can be viewed as having two parts.

   o  a specification of generation and reception of MPA FULPDUs.  This
      is unchanged by Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment.

   o  a pre-MPA exchange of messages to enable a specific MPA mode for
      the TCP connection.  Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment
      extends this protocol with two new features.

   In typical implementations, generation and reception of MPA FULPDUs
   is handled by hardware.  The exchange of the MPA Request and Reply
   frames is then handled by host software.  As will be explained, this
   implementation split prevents applications from working around the
   client-server assumptions in the current MPA Request/Reply exchange.

4.2.  Lack of Explicit RTR in MPA Request/Reply Exchange

   The exchange of MPA Request and Reply messages to place a TCP
   connection in MPA mode is specified in RFC 5044 [RFC5044].  This
   protocol provides many benefits to the design of MPA FULPDU hardware:

   o  The ULP is responsible for specifying the exact MPA Mode (Markers
      enabled or disabled, CRC-32c enabled or suppressed) and the point
      in the TCP streams (inbound and outbound) where MPA frames will
      begin.

   o  Before the first MPA frame is transmitted, all pre-MPA mode TCP
      payload will have been acknowledged by the peer.  Therefore it is
      never necessary to generate a retransmission that mixes pre-MPA
      and MPA payload.




Kanevsky, et al.         Expires August 24, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment    February 2010


   o  Before MPA reception is enabled, all incoming pre-MPA mode TCP
      payload will have been acknowledged.  Therefore the host will
      never receive a TCP segment that mixes pre-MPA and MPA payload.

   The limitation of the current MPA Request/Reply exchange is that it
   does not define a Ready to Receive (RTR) message that the active side
   would send, so that the passive side can know that the last non-MPA
   payload (the MPA Reply) had been received.

   Instead, the role of an RTR message is piggy-backed on the first MPA
   FULPDU sent by the active side.  This is actually a valuable
   optimization for all applications that fit the classic client/server
   model.  The client only initiates the connection when it has a
   request to send to the server, and the server has nothing to send
   until it has received and processed the client request.

   Even applications where the server sends some configuration data
   immediately can easily send the same information as application
   private data in the MPA Reply.  So the currently defined exchange
   works for almost all applications.

   Many peer-to-peer applications, especially those involving cluster
   calculations (frequently using MPI [UsingMPI], or [RDS]), have no
   natural client or server roles ([PPMPI], [OpenMP]).  Typically one
   member of the cluster is arbitrarily selected to initiate the
   connection when the distributed task is launched, while the other
   accepts it.  At startup time, however, there is no way to predict
   which node will have the first message to actually send.
   Establishing the connections immediately, however, is valuable
   because it reduces latency once results are ready to transmit and it
   validates connectivity throughout the cluster.

   The lack of an explicit RTR message in the MPA Request/Reply exchange
   forces all applications to have a first message from the connection
   initiator, whether this matches the application communication model
   or not.

4.3.  Limitations on ULP Workaround

   The requirement that the RDMA connection initiator sends the first
   message does not appear to be that onerous on first examination.  The
   natural question is why the application layer would not simply
   generate a "nop" message when there was no other message to submit.

   There are three factors that make this workaround unsuitable for many
   peer-to-peer applications.

   o  Transport Neutral APIs.

   o  Work/Completion Queue Accounting.

   o  Host-based implementation of MPA Fencing.

4.3.1.  Transport Neutral APIs

   Many of these applications access RDMA services using a transport
   neutral API just as [DAPL] or [OFA].  Only MPA has a first message
   requirement.  Other RDMA transports, including SCTP and InfiniBand,
   do not.

   Application or middleware communications can be expressed as
   transport neutral RDMA operations, allowing lower software layers to
   translate to transport and device specifics.  Having a distinct extra
   message that is required only for one transport undermines the
   application's goal of being transport neutral.

4.3.2.  Work/Completion Queue Accounting

   RDMA local APIs conventionally use work queues to submit requests
   (work queue elements or WQEs) and to asynchronously receive
   completions (in completion queues or CQs).

   Each work request can generate a completion queue entries (CQE).
   Completions for successful transmit work requests are frequently
   suppressed, but the completion queue capacity must account for the
   possibility that each will complete in error.  A completion queue can
   receive completions from multiple work queues.

   Completion Queues are defined so as to allow hardware RDMA
   implementations to generate CQEs directly to a user-space mapped
   buffer.  This enables a user-space RDMA consumer to reap completions
   without requiring kernel intervention.

   A hardware RDMA implementation cannot reasonably wait for an
   available slot in the completion queue.  The queue must be sized such
   that an overflow will not occur.  When an overflow does occur it is
   considered catastrophic and will typically require tearing down all
   RDMA connections using that CQ.

   This style of interface is very efficient, but places a burden on the
   application to properly size each Completion Queue to match the Work
   Queues that feed it.

   While the format of both WQEs and CQEs is transport and device
   dependent, a transport neutral API can deal with WQEs and CQEs as



Kanevsky, et al.         Expires August 24, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment    February 2010


   abstract transport and device neutral objects.  Therefore the number
   of WQEs and CQEs required for an application can be transport and
   device neutral.

   The capacity of the work queues and completion queues can be
   calculated in an abstract transport/device neutral fashion.  Lower
   layers of the protocol stack cannot disrupt these calculations by
   inserting a dummy "nop" Work Request and filtering out the matching
   completion.  The lower layer does not know the usage model on which
   the queue sizes are built, nor does it know how frequently an
   insertion will be required.

4.3.3.  Host-based Implementation of MPA Fencing

   Many hardware implementations of iWARP using MPA/TCP do not handle
   the MPA Request/Reply exchange in hardware, rather they are handled
   by the host processor in software.  With such designs it is common
   for the MPA Fencing to be implemented in the user-space device-
   specific library (commonly referred to as a 'User Verbs' library or
   module).

   When the generation and reception of MPA FULPDUs is already dedicated
   to hardware, a Work Completion can only be generated by an untagged
   message.

4.4.  Standardized RDMA Parameter Negotiation

   Most RDMA applications are developed using a transport neutral API to
   access RDMA services based on a "queue pair" paradigm as originally
   defined by the Virtual Interface Architecture [VIA], refined by the
   Direct Access Programming Library [DAPL] and most commonly deployed
   with the OpenFabrics API [OFA]

   These transport neutral APIs seek to provide a common set of RDMA
   services whether the underlying transport is, for example, iWARP over
   MPA, iWARP over SCTP or InfiniBand.

   The common model for establishing an RDMA connection has the
   following steps:

   o  The passive side ULP listens for connection requests.

   o  The active side ULP submits a connection request using an RDMA
      endpoint ("queue pair"), the desired destination and the
      parameters to be used for the connection.  Those parameters
      include both RDMA layer characteristics, such as the RDMA Read
      credits to be allowed and application specific data (typically
      referred to as "private data").



Kanevsky, et al.         Expires August 24, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment    February 2010


   o  The passive side ULP receives the Connection Request, which
      includes the identity of the active side and the requested
      connection characteristics.  The passive side ULP uses this
      information to decide whether to accept the connection, and if it
      is to be accepted, how to create and/or configure the RDMA
      endpoint.

   o  If accepting, the passive side ULP submits its acceptance of the
      Connection Request.  This local accept operation includes the RDMA
      endpoint to be used and the connection characteristics (both the
      RDMA configuration and any application specific private data to be
      returned).

   o  The active side receives confirmation that the connection has been
      accepted, what the configured connection characteristics are, and
      any application supplied private data.

   As currently defined, DDP connection establishment requires the ULP
   to encode the RDMA configuration in the application specific private
   data.  This results undesirable duplication of logic to cover both
   InfiniBand and iWARP, and to specify the extraction of the RDMA
   characteristics from the ULP for each specific Upper Layer Protocol.

   A standard definition of the RDMA characteristics within the private
   data section would enable common connection establishment APIs to
   format the RDMA characteristics based on the same API information
   used when establishing an InfiniBand connection.  The application
   would then only have to indicate that it was using this standard
   format to enable common connection establishment procedures to apply
   common code to properly parse these fields and configure the RDMA
   endpoints accordingly.


5.  MPA Connection Setup

   Below we provide overview of Enhanced Connection Setup.  The goal is
   to allow standard negotiation of ORD/IRD setting on both sides of the
   RDMA connection and/or to negotiate the initial data transfer
   operation by an initiator when the existing 'client sends first' rule
   does not match application requirements.

   The RDMA connection initiator sends an MPA Request, as specified in
   [RFC5044]; the new format defined here allows for:

   o  Standardized negotiation of ORD and IRD.

   o  Negotiation of an RTR message.




Kanevsky, et al.         Expires August 24, 2010                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft   Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment    February 2010


   The RDMA connection responder processes the MPA Request and generates
   an MPA Reply, as specified in [RFC5044]; the new format completes the
   negotiation.

   The local interface SHOULD require the ULP to explicitly configure on
   a per-application or per-connection basis when an explicit RTR
   message will be required.  Piggy-backing the RTR on a Client's first
   message is a valuable optimization for most connections.

   The RDMA connection initiator MUST NOT inform its ULP that the RDMA
   connection has been established until after any required RTR Message
   has been transmitted.


6.  Enhanced MPA Request/Reply Frames

   Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment uses an alternate format for
   MPA Requests and Replies, as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3

                          MPA Request/Reply Frame

   Key:  Unchanged from [RFC5044].

   M: Unchanged from [RFC5044].

   C: Unchanged from [RFC5044].

   R: Unchanged from [RFC5044].

   S: One if the Private Data begins with the Enhanced RDMA Connection
      Establishment Data.  Zero otherwise.

   Res:  One bit smaller than in [RFC5044], otherwise unchanged.

   Rev:  This field contains the revision of MPA.  To use any Enhanced
      Connection Establishment feature this MUST be set to two, If no
      Enhanced Connection Establishment features are desired it MAY be
      set to one.  A host accepting MPA connections SHOULD continue to
      accept MPA Requests with version one even if it supports version
      two.

   PD Length:  Unchanged from [RFC5044].  This is the total length of
      the Private Data field, including the Enhanced RDMA Connection
      Establishment Data if present.

   Private Data:  Unchanged from [RFC5044].  However, if the 'S' flag is
      set, Private Data begins with Enhanced RDMA Connection
      Establishment Data.


7.  Enhanced SCTP Session Control Chunks

   The type of the SCTP Session Control Chunk is defined by a Function
   Code.  [RFC5043] already defines codes for 'DDP Stream Session
   Initiate' and 'DDP Stream Session Accept', which are equivalent to a
   MPA Request Frame and an accepting MPA Reply Frame.

   Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment requires three additional
   Function codes, as follows:

   Enhanced DDP Stream Session Initiate:  0x05

   Enhanced DDP Stream Session Accept:  0x06

   Enhanced DDP Stream Session Reject:  0x07

   The Enhanced Reject function code SHOULD be used to indicate a
   configuration that would have been accepted.

   It should be noted that [RFC5043] already supports either side
   sending the first DDP Message.  The Payload Protocol Identifier
   (PPID) already distinguishes between Session Establishment and DDP
   Segments.

                Enhanced RDMA Connection Establishment Data

   IRD:  In request: the Initiator requested responder IRD for the
      connection.  In reply: the depth the Responder will support.  An
      all ones value (0x3FFF) indicates that automatic negotiation of
      the IRD is not desired, and that the ULP will be responsible for
      doing this configuration.

   ORD:  In request: the Initiator initial ORD setting for the
      connection.  In reply: the depth the Responder will support.  An
      all ones value (0x3FFF) indicates that automatic negotiation of
      the IRD is not desired, and that the ULP will be responsible for
      doing this configuration.

   A: Control Flag for using a zero length ULPDU as the RTR message.

   B: Control Flag for using a zero length RDMA Write as the RTR
      message.

   C: Control Flag for using a zero length RDMA Read as the RTR message.

   D: Reserved.  Must be sent as zero and ignored when received.

   In the MPA Request, the Control Flag MUST be set unless the Initiator
   cannot support this option, or can only do so in collaboration with
   the ULP.

   In the MPA Reply, the Control Flag is set for the set of options that
   the passive side will accept as an RTR message.  This response MUST
   include all options that the responder will support without requiring
   a connection specific enabling action.  For example, if the responder
   will always unblock an MPA connection when it receives a zero length
   MPA Write, it should so indicate without regard to what was in the
   MPA Request.  Options which require connection specific enabling
   actions SHOULD NOT be set unless the corresponding flag was set in
   the MPA Request.  The respondent MAY choose to limit the number of
   modes that it enables.

   If there is no Standard RDMAP Configuration Data in the MPA Reply
   Frame, and the Enhanced Connection Establishment version number is
   used, it is the equivalent of setting 'A', 'B' and 'C'.

   Setting no Control Flags in the MPA Reply indicates that an RDMA Send
   message will be required.  As that this option will require the
   initiator ULP to be involved it SHOULD NOT be used unless necessary.


9.  Interoperability

   An initiator SHOULD NOT use the Enhanced DDP Connection Establishment
   formats or function codes when no enhanced functionality is desired.

   A responder SHOULD continue to accept the unenhanced connection
   requests.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.


11.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from RFC 5044 apply and the changes in
   this document do not introduce new security considerations.

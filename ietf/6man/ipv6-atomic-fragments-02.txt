                 Processing of IPv6 "atomic" fragments
                draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-atomic-fragments-02

Abstract

   The IPv6 specification allows packets to contain a Fragment Header
   without the packet being actually fragmented into multiple pieces.
   Such packets typically result from hosts that have received an ICMPv6
   "Packet Too Big" error message that advertises a "Next-Hop MTU"
   smaller than 1280 bytes, and are currently processed by some
   implementations as "fragmented traffic".  Thus, by forging ICMPv6
   "Packet Too Big" error messages an attacker can cause hosts to employ
   "atomic fragments", and then launch any fragmentation-based attacks
   against such traffic.  This document discusses the generation of the
   aforementioned "atomic fragments", the corresponding security
   implications, and formally updates RFC 2460 and RFC 5722 such that
   fragmentation-based attack vectors against traffic employing "atomic
   fragments" are completely eliminated.

Internet-Draft            IPv6 atomic fragments            November 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC2460] specifies the IPv6 fragmentation mechanism, which allows
   IPv6 packets to be fragmented into smaller pieces such that they fit
   in the Path-MTU to the intended destination(s).  [RFC2460] allowed
   fragments to overlap, thus leading to ambiguity in the result of the
   reassembly process, which could be leveraged by attackers to bypass
   firewall rules and/or evade Network Intrusion Detection Systems
   (NIDS) [RFC5722].

   [RFC5722] forbid overlapping fragments, specifying that when
   overlapping fragments are detected, all the fragments corresponding
   to that packet must be silently discarded.

   As specified in Section 5 of [RFC2460], when a host receives an
   ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" message advertising a "Next-Hop MTU" smaller
   than 1280 (the minimum IPv6 MTU), it is not required to reduce the
   assumed Path-MTU, but must simply include a Fragment Header in all
   subsequent packets sent to that destination.  The resulting packets
   will thus *not* be actually fragmented into several pieces, but just
   include a Fragment Header with both the "Fragment Offset" and the "M"
   bit set to 0.

   While these packets are really "atomic fragments" (they can be
   processed by the IPv6 module and handed to the upper-layer protocol
   without waiting for any other fragments), many IPv6 implementations
   process them as regular fragments.  Namely, they try to perform IPv6
   fragment reassembly with the "atomic fragment" and any other
   fragments already queued with the same set {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6
   Destination Address, Fragment Identification}.  For example, in the
   case of IPv6 implementations that have been updated to support
   [RFC5722], if a fragment with the same {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6
   Destination Address, Fragment Identification} is already queued for
   reassembly at a host when an "atomic fragment" is received with the
   same set {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address, Fragment
   Identification}, and both fragments overlap, all the fragments will
   be silently discarded.

   Processing of IPv6 "atomic fragments" as regular fragmented packets
   clearly provides an unnecessary vector to perform fragmentation-based
   attacks against non-fragmented traffic (i.e., IPv6 datagrams that are
   not really split into multiple pieces, but that just include a
   Fragment Header).

   IPv6 fragmentation attacks have been discussed in great detail in
   [PREDICTABLE-ID] and [CPNI-IPv6], and [RFC5722] describes a specific
   firewall-circumvention attack that could be performed by leveraging
   overlapping fragments.  The possible IPv6 fragmentation-based attacks

   are, in most cases, "ports" of the IPv4 fragmentation attacks
   discussed in [RFC6274].

   Section 2 describes the generation of IPv6 "atomic fragments", and
   how they can be remotely "triggered" by a remote attacker.  Section 3
   formally updates [RFC2460] and [RFC5722] such that the aforementioned
   attack vector is eliminated.  Appendix A contains a survey of the
   generation and processing of IPv6 atomic fragments in different
   versions of a number of popular IPv6 implementations.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Generation of IPv6 'atomic fragments'

   Section 5 of [RFC2460] states:

      In response to an IPv6 packet that is sent to an IPv4 destination
      (i.e., a packet that undergoes translation from IPv6 to IPv4), the
      originating IPv6 node may receive an ICMP Packet Too Big message
      reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280.  In that case, the IPv6
      node is not required to reduce the size of subsequent packets to
      less than 1280, but must include a Fragment header in those
      packets so that the IPv6-to-IPv4 translating router can obtain a
      suitable Identification value to use in resulting IPv4 fragments.
      Note that this means the payload may have to be reduced to 1232
      octets (1280 minus 40 for the IPv6 header and 8 for the Fragment
      header), and smaller still if additional extension headers are
      used.

   This means that any ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" message advertising a
   "Next-Hop MTU" smaller than 1280 could trigger the generation of the
   so-called "atomic fragments" (i.e., IPv6 datagrams that include a
   Fragment Header, but that are composed of a single fragment, with
   both the "Fragment Offset" and the "M" fields of the Fragment Header
   set to 0).  This can be leveraged to perform a variety of
   fragmentation-based attacks [PREDICTABLE-ID] [CPNI-IPv6].

   From a security standpoint, this situation is exacerbated by the
   following factors:

   o  Many implementations fail to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error messages, as recommended in Section 5.2 of
      [RFC4443] and [RFC5927].

         In some cases, such as when an ICMPv6 error message has
         (supposedly) been elicited by a connection-less transport
         protocol (or some other connection-less protocol being
         encapsulated in IPv6), it may be virtually impossible to
         perform validation checks on the received ICMPv6 error
         messages.

   o  Upon receipt of one of the aforementioned ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big"
      error messages, the Destinations Cache is usually updated to
      reflect that any subsequent packets to such destination should
      include a Fragment Header.  This means that a single ICMPv6
      "Packet Too Big" error message might affect multiple communication
      instances (e.g., TCP connections) with such destination.

   o  Some implementations employ predictable Fragment Identification
      values, thus greatly improving the chances of an attacker of

3.  Updating RFC 2460 and RFC 5722

   Section 4.5 of [RFC2460] and Section 4 of [RFC5722] are updated as
   follows:

      A host that receives an IPv6 packet which includes a Fragment
      Header with the "Fragment Offset" equal to 0 and the "M" bit equal
      to 0 MUST process such packet in isolation from any other packets/
      fragments, even if such packets/fragments contain the same set
      {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address, Fragment
      Identification}.  A received "atomic fragments" should be
      "reassembled" from the contents of that sole fragment.

         The Unfragmentable Part of the reassembled packet consists of
         all headers up to, but not including, the Fragment header of
         the received atomic fragment.

         The Next Header field of the last header of the Unfragmentable
         Part of the reassembled packet is obtained from the Next Header
         field of the Fragment header of the received atomic fragment.

         The Payload Length of the reassembled packet is obtained by
         substracting the length of the Fragment Header (that is, 8)
         from the Payload Length of the received atomic fragment.

      Additionally, if any fragments with the same set {IPV6 Source
      Address, IPv6 Destination Address, Fragment Identification} are
      present in the fragment reassembly queue when the atomic fragment
      is received, such fragments MUST NOT be discarded upon receipt of
      the "colliding" IPv6 atomic fragment, since IPv6 atomic fragments
      MUST NOT interfere with "normal" fragmented traffic.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes how an attacker can exploit ICMPv6 "Packet
   Too Big" error messages to cause further IPv6 packets to include a
   Fragment Header, such that he can perform any fragmentation-based
   attack against otherwise non-fragmented traffic.  This document
   updates [RFC2460] and [RFC5722], such that the aforementioned attack
   vector is completely eliminated.

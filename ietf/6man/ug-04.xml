<t>
The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface identifier that
is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses. Interface identifiers are formed
by a variety of methods. This document clarifies that the bits in an interface
identifier have no generic meaning and that the identifier should be treated
as an opaque value. In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the Universal
and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.
This document clarifies that those two bits are significant only in interface identifiers that are
derived from an IEEE link-layer address, and updates RFC 4291 accordingly.
</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>IPv6 unicast addresses consist of a prefix followed by an Interface Identifier (IID). The
IID is supposed to be unique on the links reached by routing to that prefix, giving
an IPv6 address that is unique within the applicable scope (link local or global).
According to the IPv6 addressing architecture <xref target="RFC4291"/>, when a 64-bit IPv6 unicast
IID is formed on the basis of an IEEE EUI-64 address, usually itself
expanded from a 48-bit MAC address, a particular format must be used:</t>

<figure><artwork>
  "For all unicast addresses, except those that start with the binary
   value 000, Interface IDs are required to be 64 bits long and to be
   constructed in Modified EUI-64 format."
</artwork></figure>

<t>Thus the specification assumes that the normal case is to transform an
Ethernet-style address into an IID, but in practice, there are various
methods of forming such an interface identifier. </t>

<t>The Modified EUI-64 format preserves the
information provided by two particular bits in the MAC address:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
<t>The "u/l" bit in a MAC address <xref target="IEEE802"/> is set to 0 to indicate universal scope
(implying uniqueness) or to 1 to indicate local scope (without implying uniqueness).
In an IID formed from a MAC address, this bit is simply known as the "u" bit and its
value is inverted, i.e., 1 for universal scope and 0 for local scope.
According to RFC 4291 and <xref target="RFC5342"/>, the reason for this was to make
it easier for network operators to manually configure local-scope IIDs. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
In an IID, this bit is in position 6, i.e., position 70 in the complete IPv6 address.
</t>

<t>The "i/g" bit in a MAC address is set to 1 to indicate group addressing
(link-layer multicast).  The value of this bit is preserved in an IID, where it is
known as the "g" bit. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
In an IID, this bit is in position 7, i.e., position 71 in the complete IPv6 address.
</t>
</list></t>

<t>This document discusses problems observed with the "u" and "g" bits as a
result of the above requirements and the fact that various other methods
of forming an IID have been defined, quite independently of the method
described in Appendix A of RFC 4291. It then discusses the usefulness of these
two bits and the significance of the bits in an IID in general. Finally, it
updates RFC 4291 accordingly. </t>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>
</section> <!-- intro -->

<section anchor="problem" title="Problem statement">

<t>In addition to IIDs formed from IEEE EUI-64 addresses, various new forms
of IID have been defined, including temporary addresses <xref target="RFC4941"/>,
Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) <xref target="RFC3972"/>,
Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs) <xref target="RFC5535"/>, and ISATAP addresses <xref target="RFC5214"/>.
Other methods have been proposed, such as 
stable privacy addresses <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses"/>, 
<!-- simple secure addressing <xref target="I-D.rafiee-6man-ssas"/>, -->
and mapped addresses for 4rd <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd"/>.
In each case, the question of how to set the "u" and "g" bits
has to be decided. For example, RFC 3972 specifies that they are both zero in CGAs,
and the same applies to HBAs. On the other hand, RFC 4941 specifies that "u" must be zero
but leaves "g" variable. The NAT64 addressing format <xref target="RFC6052"/> sets the whole
byte containing "u" and "g" to zero. </t>

<t>Another case where the "u" and "g" bits are specified is in the 
Reserved IPv6 Subnet Anycast Address format <xref target="RFC2526"/>, which states
that "for interface identifiers in EUI-64 format, the universal/local bit in the
interface identifier MUST be set to 0" (i.e., local) and requires that "g" bit
to be set to 1. However, the text neither states nor implies any semantics for these
bits in anycast addresses. </t>

<t>A common operational practice for well-known servers is to manually assign
a small number as the IID, in which case "u" and "g" are both zero. </t>

<t>These cases illustrate that the statement quoted above from RFC 4291 requiring
"Modified EUI-64 format" is inapplicable when applied to forms of IID that
are not in fact based on an underlying EUI-64 address. In practice, the IETF
has chosen to assign some 64-bit IIDs that have nothing to do with EUI-64. </t>

<t>A particular case is that of /127 prefixes for point-to-point links between
routers, as standardised by <xref target="RFC6164"/>. The addresses on these links
are undoubtedly global unicast addresses, but they do not have a 64-bit IID.
The bits in the positions named "u" and "g" in such an IID have no special
significance and their values are not specified. </t>

<t>Each time a new IID format is proposed, the question arises whether these bits have any 
meaning. Section 2.2.1 of RFC 5342 discusses the mechanics of the bit
allocations but does not explain the purpose or usefulness of these bits in an IID.
There is an IANA registry for reserved IID values <xref target="RFC5453"/> but again
there is no explanation of the purpose of the "u" and "g" bits. </t>

<t>There was a presumption when IPv6 was designed and the IID format was first
specified that a universally unique IID might prove to be very useful, for
example to contribute to solving the multihoming problem. Indeed, the addressing
architecture <xref target="RFC4291"/> states this explicitly: </t>

<figure><artwork>
  "The use of the universal/local bit in the Modified EUI-64 format
   identifier is to allow development of future technology that can take
   advantage of interface identifiers with universal scope."
</artwork></figure>

<t>However, this has not so far proved to be the case. Also, there is evidence from
the field that MAC addresses with universal scope are sometimes assigned to
multiple MAC interfaces. There are recurrent reports of manufacturers
assigning the same MAC address to multiple devices,
<!-- (for example, see slides 63 and 64 at <eref target="https://speakerdeck.com/hdm/derbycon-2012-the-wild-west"/>) --> 
and significant re-use
of the same virtual MAC address is reported in virtual machine environments.
<!-- (for example, <eref target="http://enterpriseadmins.org/blog/scripting/virtual-machines-with-duplicate-mac-addresses"/>). -->
Once transformed into IID format (with "u" = 1) these
identifiers would purport to be universally unique but would in fact be
ambiguous. This has no known harmful effect as long as the replicated MAC addresses
and IIDs are used on different layer 2 links. If they are used on the same link,
of course there will be a problem, very likely interfering with link-layer
transmission. If not, the problem will be detected by duplicate address detection
<xref target="RFC4862"/> <xref target="RFC6775"/>, but such an error can usually
only be resolved by human intervention. </t>

<t>The conclusion from this is that the "u" bit is not a reliable indicator
of universal uniqueness. </t>

<t>We note that Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP), a multihoming solution that might
be expected to benefit from universally unique IIDs in modified EUI-64 format,
does not in fact rely on them. ILNP uses its own format, defined as a Node Identifier 
<xref target="RFC6741"/>. ILNP has the constraint  that a given Node Identifier 
must be unique within the context of a given Locator (i.e. within a single given IPv6
subnetwork). As we have just shown, the state of the "u" bit
does not in any way guarantee such uniqueness, but duplicate address detection
is available. </t>

<t>Thus, we can conclude that the value of the "u" bit in IIDs has no
particular meaning. In the case of an IID created from a MAC address according
to RFC 4291, its value is determined by the MAC address, but that is all. </t>

<t>An IPv6 IID should not be created from a MAC group address, so the "g" bit will 
normally be zero, but this value also has no particular meaning.
Additionally, the "u" and the "g" bits are both meaningless in the format
of an IPv6 multicast group ID <xref target="RFC3306"/> <xref target="RFC3307"/>. </t>

<t>None of the above implies that there is a problem with using the "u" and "g" bits
in MAC addresses as part of the process of generating IIDs from MAC addresses, or with specifying
their values in other methods of generating IIDs. What it does imply is that, after an IID
is generated by any method, no reliable deductions can be made from the state of
the "u" and "g" bits; in other words, these bits have no useful semantics in an IID. </t>

<t>Once this is recognised, we can avoid the problematic confusion caused by these
bits each time that a new form of IID is proposed.  </t>

</section> <!-- problem -->

<section anchor="value" title="Usefulness of the U and G Bits">

<t>Given that the "u" and "g" bits do not have a reliable meaning in an IID, it is relevant to
consider what usefulness they do have. </t>

<t>If an IID is known or guessed to have been created according
to RFC 4291, it could be transformed back into a MAC address. This can be very
helpful during operational fault diagnosis. For that reason, mapping the IEEE "u" and "g"
bits into the IID has operational usefulness. However, it should be stressed that an IID
with "u" = 1 and "g" = 0 might not be formed from a MAC address; on the contrary,
it might equally result from another method. With other methods, 
there is no reverse transformation available. </t>

<t>Given that the values of the "u" and "g" bits in an IID have no particular meaning, new methods
of IID formation are at liberty to use them as they wish, for example as additional
pseudo-random bits to reduce the chances of duplicate IIDs. </t>

</section> <!-- value -->

<section anchor="dad" title="The Role of Duplicate Address Detection">
<t>As mentioned above, Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) <xref target="RFC4862"/> is
able to detect any case where a collision of two IIDs on the same link
leads to a duplicated IPv6 address. The scope of DAD may be extended to a set of links
by a DAD proxy <xref target="RFC6957"/> or by Neighbor Discovery Optimization
<xref target="RFC6775"/>. Since DAD is mandatory for all nodes,
there will be almost no case in which an IID collision, however unlikely it may be,
is not detected. It is out of scope of most existing specifications to define
the recovery action after a DAD failure, which is an implementation issue.
If a manually created IID, or an IID derived from a MAC address according 
to RFC 4291, leads to a DAD failure, human intervention will most likely be required. 
However, as mentioned above, some methods of IID formation might produce IID values with 
"u" = 1 and "g" = 0 that are not based on a MAC address. With very low probability, such 
a value might collide with an IID based on a MAC address. </t>

<t>As stated in RFC 4862:</t>
<figure><artwork>
  "On the other hand, if the duplicate link-local address is not formed
   from an interface identifier based on the hardware address, which is
   supposed to be uniquely assigned, IP operation on the interface MAY
   be continued."
</artwork></figure>

<t>Continued operation is only possible if a new IID is created. The best procedure to
follow for this will depend on the IID formation method in use. For example, if an IID is
formed by a pseudo-random process, that process could simply be repeated. </t>

</section> <!-- dad -->

<section anchor="solution" title="Clarification of Specifications">

<t>This section describes clarifications to the IPv6 specifications that result from
the above discussion. Their aim is to reduce confusion while retaining the useful
aspects of the "u" and "g" bits in IIDs. </t>

<t>The EUI-64 to IID transformation defined in the IPv6 addressing architecture
<xref target="RFC4291"/> MUST be used for all cases
where an IPv6 IID is derived from an IEEE MAC or EUI-64 address. With any other form
of link layer address, an equivalent transformation SHOULD be used. </t>

<t>Specifications of other forms of 64-bit IID MUST specify how all 64 bits are set,
but need not treat the "u" and "g" bits in any special way.
A generic semantic meaning for these bits MUST NOT be defined. However, the method of
generating IIDs for specific link types MAY define some local significance
for certain bits.</t>

<t> In all cases, the bits in an IID have no generic semantics; in other words,
they have opaque values. In fact, the whole IID value MUST be viewed as an opaque bit string
by third parties, except possibly in the local context.</t>

<t>The following statement in section 2.5.1 of the IPv6 addressing architecture <xref target="RFC4291"/>:
</t>

<figure><artwork>
  "For all unicast addresses, except those that start with the binary
   value 000, Interface IDs are required to be 64 bits long and to be
   constructed in Modified EUI-64 format."
</artwork></figure>

<t>is replaced by:</t>

<figure><artwork>
  "For all unicast addresses, except those that start with the binary
   value 000, Interface IDs are required to be 64 bits long. If derived
   from an IEEE MAC-layer address, they must be constructed in Modified
   EUI-64 format."
</artwork></figure>


<t>The following statement in section 2.5.1 of the IPv6 addressing architecture <xref target="RFC4291"/>
is obsoleted: </t>

<figure><artwork>
  "The use of the universal/local bit in the Modified EUI-64 format
   identifier is to allow development of future technology that can take
   advantage of interface identifiers with universal scope."
</artwork></figure>

<t>As far as is known, no existing implementation will be affected by these changes.
The benefit is that future design discussions are simplified. </t>


</section> <!-- solution -->


<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>No new security exposures or issues are raised by this document. </t>

<t>In some contexts, unpredictable IID values are considered beneficial to
enhance privacy and defeat scanning attacks. The recognition that the IID value
should be regarded as an opaque bit string is consistent with methods
of IID formation that result in unpredictable, pseudo-random values. </t>

</section> <!-- security -->


<section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
<t>This document requests no immediate action by IANA. However, the following should be noted
when considering any future proposed addition to the registry of reserved IID values,
which requires Standards Action according to <xref target="RFC5453"/>. </t>

<t>Full deployment of a new reserved IID value would require
updates to IID generation code in every deployed IPv6 stack, so the technical justification
for such a Standards Action would need to be extremely strong. </t>

<!-- <t>A reserved IID, or a range of reserved IIDs, will most likely specify values for
both "u" and "g", since they are among the high-order bits. At the present time,
none of the standard methods of generating IIDs will generate "u" = "g" = 1. 
Reserved IIDs with "u" = "g" = 1 are therefore unlikely to collide with automatically
generated IIDs. </t> (Removed in -04 because it adds nothing new) -->

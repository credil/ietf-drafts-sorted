    <abstract>
      <t>On inter-router point-to-point links, it is useful for security and
      other reasons, to use 127-bit IPv6 prefixes. Such a practice parallels
      the use of 31-bit prefixes in IPv4 <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC3021"></xref>. This document specifies motivation and usages
      of 127-bit IPv6 prefix lengths on inter-router point-to-point links.</t>

      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    </section>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t><xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4291"></xref>
      specifies that interface IDs for all unicast address, except those that
      start with the binary value 000, are required to be 64 bits long and to
      be constructed in Modified EUI-64 format. In addition, it defines the
      Subnet-Router anycast address, which is intended to be used for
      applications where a node needs to communicate with any one of the set
      of routers on a link.</t>

      <t>Some operators have been using 127-bit prefixes, but this has been
      discouraged due to conflicts with Subnet-Router anycast <xref
      format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3627"></xref>. However, using
      64-bit prefixes creates security issues which are particularly
      problematic on inter-router links, and there are other valid reasons to
      use prefixes longer than 64 bits, in particular /127 (see <xref
      format="default" pageno="false" target="Rationale"></xref>).</t>

      <t>This document provides rationale for using 127-bit prefix lengths,
      reevaluates the reasons why doing so was considered harmful, and
      specifies how /127 prefixes can be used on inter-router links configured
      for use as point-to-point links.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Scope" title="Scope Of This Memo" toc="default">
      <t>This document is applicable to cases where operators assign specific
      addresses on inter-router point-to-point links and do not rely on
      link-local addresses. Many operators assign specific addresses for
      purposes of network monitoring, reverse DNS resolution for traceroute
      and other management tools, EBGP peering sessions, and so on.</t>

      <t>For the purposes of this document, an inter-router point-to-point
      link is a link to which only two routers and no hosts are attached. This
      may include Ethernet links which are configured to be point-to-point.
      Links between a router and a host, or links to which both routers and
      hosts are attached, are out of scope of this document.</t>

      <t>The recommendations in this document does not apply to link-local
      address scope.</t>

    <section anchor="Problems"
             title="Problems identified with 127-bit prefix lengths in the past"
             toc="default">
      <t><xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3627"></xref>
      discourages the use of 127-bit prefix lengths due to conflicts with the
      Subnet-Router anycast addresses, while stating that the utility of
      Subnet-Router Anycast for point-to-point links is questionable.</t>

      <t><xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5375"></xref> also
      says the usage of 127-bit prefix lengths is not valid and should be
      strongly discouraged, but the stated reason for doing this is to be in
      compliance with <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC3627"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Though the analyses in the RFCs are correct, operational experience
      with IPv6 has shown that /127 prefixes can be used successfully.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Rationale" title="Reasons for using longer prefixes"
             toc="default">
      <t>There are reasons network operators use IPv6 prefix lengths greater
      than 64, particularly 127, for inter-router point-to-point links.</t>

      <section anchor="Pingpong" title="Ping-pong issue" toc="default">
        <t>A forwarding loop may occur on a point-to-point link with a prefix
        length shorter than 127. This does not affect interfaces that perform
        Neighbor Discovery, but some point-to-point links, which uses medium
        such as SONET, do not use Neighbor Discovery. As a consequence,
        configuring any prefix length shorter than 127 bits on these links can
        create an attack vector in the network.</t>

        <t>The pingpong issue happens in case of IPv4 as well. But due to the
        scarcity of IPv4 address space, the current practice is to assign long
        prefix lengths such as /30 or /31 <xref format="default"
        pageno="false" target="RFC3021"></xref> on point-to-point links, thus
        the problem did not come to the fore.</t>

        <t>The latest ICMPv6 specification <xref format="default"
        pageno="false" target="RFC4443"></xref> mitigates this problem by
        specifying that a router receiving a packet on a point-to-point link,
        which is destined to an address within a subnet assigned to that same
        link (other than one of the receiving router's own addresses), MUST
        NOT forward the packet back on that link. Instead, it SHOULD generate
        an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message code 3 in response. This
        check is on the forwarding processing path, so it may have performance
        impact.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Neighbor Cache" title="Neighbor Cache Exhaustion issue"
               toc="default">
        <t>As described in Section 4.3.2 of <xref format="default"
        pageno="false" target="RFC3756"></xref>, the use of a 64-bit prefix
        length on an inter-router link that uses Neighbor Discovery (e.g.,
        Ethernet) potentially allows for denial-of-service attacks on the
        routers on the link.</t>

        <t>Consider an Ethernet link between two routers A and B to which a
        /64 subnet has been assigned. A packet sent to any address on the /64
        (except the addresses of A and B) will cause the router attempting to
        forward it to create an new cache entry in state INCOMPLETE, send a
        Neighbor Solicitation message to be sent on the link, start a
        retransmit timer, and so on <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

        <t>By sending a continuous stream of packets to a large number of the
        2^64 - 3 unassigned addresses on the link (one for each router and one
        for Subnet-Router Anycast), an attacker can create a large number of
        neighbor cache entries and send a large number of Neighbor
        Solicitation packets which will never receive replies, thereby
        consuming large amounts of memory and processing resources. Sending
        the packets to one of the 2^24 addresses on the link which has the
        same Solicited-Node multicast address as one of the routers also
        causes the victim to spend large amounts of processing time discarding
        useless Neighbor Solicitation messages.</t>

        <t>Careful implementation and rate-limiting can limit the impact of
        such an attack, but are unlikely to neutralize it completely.
        Rate-limiting neighbor solicitation messages will reduce CPU usage,
        and following the garbage-collection recommendations in <xref
        format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4861"></xref> will maintain
        reachability, but if the link is down and neighbor cache entries have
        expired while the attack is ongoing, legitimate traffic (for example,
        BGP sessions) over the link might never be re-established because the
        routers cannot resolve each others' IPv6 addresses to MAC
        addresses.</t>

        <t>This attack is not specific to point-to-point links, but is
        particularly harmful in the case of point-to-point backbone links,
        which may carry large amounts of traffic to many destinations over
        long distances.</t>

        <t>While there are a number of ways to mitigate this kind of issue,
        assigning /127 subnets eliminates it completely.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Others" title="Other reasons" toc="default">
        <t>Though address space conservation considerations are less important
        for IPv6 than they are in IPv4, some operators prefer not to assign
        /64s to individual point-to-point links. Instead, they may be able to
        number all of their point-to-point links out of a single (or small
        number of) /64s.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Recommendations" title="Recommendations" toc="default">
      <t>Routers MUST support the assignment of /127 prefixes on
      point-to-point inter-router links. Routers MUST disable subnet-router
      anycast for the prefix when /127 prefixes are used.</t>

      <t>When assigning and using any /127 prefixes, the following
      considerations apply. Some addresses have special meanings, in
      particular addresses corresponding to reserved anycast addresses. When
      assigning prefixes (and addresses) to links, care should be taken to
      ensure that addresses reserved for such purposes aren't inadvertently
      assigned and used as unicast addresses. Otherwise, nodes may receive
      packets that they are not intended to receive. Specifically, assuming
      that a number of point-to-point links will be numbered out of a single
      /64 prefix:<list>
          <t>a) Addresses with all zeros in the rightmost 64 bits SHOULD NOT
          be assigned as unicast addresses, to avoid colliding with the
          Subnet-Router anycast address <xref format="default" pageno="false"
          target="RFC4291"></xref>.</t>

          <t>b) Addresses in which the rightmost 64 bits are assigned the
          highest 128 values, (i.e., ffff:ffff:ffff:ff7f to
          ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff), SHOULD NOT be used as unicast addresses to
          avoid colliding with Reserved Subnet Anycast Addresses <xref

          <abstract>
            <t>The IP Version 6 addressing architecture defines an "anycast"
            address as an IPv6 address that is assigned to one or more network
            interfaces (typically belonging to different nodes), with the
            property that a packet sent to an anycast address is routed to the
            "nearest" interface having that address, according to the routing
            protocols' measure of distance. This document defines a set of
            reserved anycast addresses within each subnet prefix, and lists
            the initial allocation of these reserved subnet anycast
            addresses.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>In some cases, the operational decision may be to use IPv6 /127
            prefix lengths, especially on point-to-point links between
            routers. Under certain situations, this may lead to one router
            claiming both addresses due to subnet-router anycast being
            implemented. This document discusses the issue and offers a couple
            of solutions to the problem; nevertheless, /127 should be avoided
            between two routers.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>The existing IETF standards specify that IPv6 Neighbor
            Discovery (ND) and Address Autoconfiguration mechanisms may be
            protected with IPsec Authentication Header (AH). However, the
            current specifications limit the security solutions to manual
            keying due to practical problems faced with automatic key
            management. This document specifies three different trust models
            and discusses the threats pertinent to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.
            The purpose of this discussion is to define the requirements for
            Securing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. This memo provides information
            for the Internet community.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure
            is its addressing plan. With its new address architecture and
            allocation policies, the introduction of IPv6 into a network means
            that network designers and operators need to reconsider their
            existing approaches to network addressing. Lack of guidelines on
            handling this aspect of network design could slow down the
            deployment and integration of IPv6. This document aims to provide
            the information and recommendations relevant to planning the
            addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments. The document also provides
            IPv6 addressing case studies for both an enterprise and an ISP
            network. This memo provides information for the Internet
            community.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>With ever-increasing pressure to conserve IP address space on
            the Internet, it makes sense to consider where relatively minor
            changes can be made to fielded practice to improve numbering
            efficiency. One such change, proposed by this document, is to
            halve the amount of address space assigned to point-to-point links
            (common throughout the Internet infrastructure) by allowing the
            use of 31-bit subnet masks in a very limited way.</t>

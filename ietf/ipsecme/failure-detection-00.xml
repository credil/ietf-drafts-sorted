    <abstract>
      <t> This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol that allows for faster 
        detection of SA desynchronization using a saved token.</t>
      <t> When an IPsec tunnel between two IKEv2 peers is disconnected due to a restart of one peer,
        it can take as much as several minutes for the other peer to discover that the reboot has 
        occurred, thus delaying recovery. In this text we propose an extension to the protocol, 
        that allows for recovery immediately following the restart.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t> IKEv2, as described in <xref target="IKEv2bis"/> and its predecessor RFC 4306, has a 
        method for recovering from a reboot of one peer. As long as traffic flows in both 
        directions, the rebooted peer should re-establish the tunnels immediately. However, in many 
        cases the rebooted peer is a VPN gateway that protects only servers, or else the 
        non-rebooted peer has a dynamic IP address. In such cases, the rebooted peer will not be 
        able to re-establish the tunnels. <xref target="SCR"/> describes how recovery works under 
        RFC 4306, and explains why it may take several minutes.</t> 
      <t> The method proposed here, is to send an octet string, called a "QCD token" in the 
        IKE_AUTH exchange that establishes the tunnel. That token can be stored on the peer as part 
        of the IKE SA. After a reboot, the rebooted implementation can re-generate the token, and 
        send it to the peer, so as to delete the IKE SA. Deleting the IKE SA results is a quick 
        establishment of new IPsec tunnels. This is described in <xref target="outline"/>.</t>
      <section anchor="mustshouldmay" title="Conventions Used in This Document">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
          "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
          in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
        <t> The term "token" refers to an octet string that an implementation can generate using 
          only the properties of a protected IKE message (such as IKE SPIs) as input. A conforming 
          implementation MUST be able to generate the same token from the same input even after 
          rebooting.</t>
        <t> The term "token maker" refers to an implementation that generates a token and sends it
          to the peer as specified in this document.</t>
        <t> The term "token taker" refers to an implementation that stores such a token or a digest
          thereof, in order to verify that a new token it receives is identical to the old token it
          has stored.</t>
        <t> The term "non-volatile storage" in this document refers to a data storage module, that
          persists across restarts of the token maker. Examples of such a storage module include an
          internal disk, an internal flash memory module, an external disk and an external 
          database. A small non-volatile storage module is required for a token maker, but a larger
          one can be used to enhance performance, as described in <xref target="operation_esp"/>.</t>

      </section>
      <section anchor="SCR" title="RFC 4306 Crash Recovery">
        <t> When one peer loses state or reboots, the other peer does not get any notification, so 
          unidirectional IPsec traffic can still flow. The rebooted peer will not be able to 
          decrypt it, however, and the only remedy is to send an unprotected INVALID_SPI 
          notification as described in section 3.10.1 of <xref target="IKEv2bis"/>.  That section 
          also describes the processing of such a notification:</t>
        <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      "If this Informational Message is sent outside the
  context of an IKE_SA, it should be used by the recipient
  only as a "hint" that something might be wrong (because it
  could easily be forged)."
        ]]></artwork></figure>
        <t> Since the INVALID_SPI can only be used as a hint, the non-rebooted peer has to determine
          whether the IPsec SA, and indeed the parent IKE SA are still valid.  The method of doing 
          this is described in section 2.4 of <xref target="IKEv2bis"/>. This method, called 
          "liveness check" involves sending a protected empty INFORMATIONAL message, and awaiting a 
          response. This procedure is sometimes referred to as "Dead Peer Detection" or DPD.</t>
        <t> Section 2.4 does not mandate how many times the liveness check message should be 
          retransmitted, or for how long, but does recommend the following:</t>
        <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
                                                            "It is
 suggested that messages be retransmitted at least a dozen times over
 a period of at least several minutes before giving up on an SA..."
        ]]></artwork></figure>
        <t> Those "at least several minutes" are a time during which both peers are active, but 
          IPsec cannot be used.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="outline" title="Protocol Outline">
        <t> Supporting implementations will send a notification, called a "QCD token", as described
          in <xref target="format_notif"/> in the last IKE_AUTH exchange messages. These are the 
          final IKE_AUTH request and final IKE_AUTH response that contain the AUTH payloads.  The 
          generation of these tokens is a local matter for implementations, but considerations are 
          described in <xref target="tokengen"/>. Implementations that send such a token will be
          called "token makers".</t>
        <t> A supporting implementation receiving such a token MUST store it (or a digest thereof)
          along with the IKE SA. Implementations that support this part of the protocol will be 
          called "token takers". <xref target="operation_who"/> has considerations for which 
          implementations need to be token takers, and which should be token makers. Implementation 
          that are not token takers will silently ignore QCD tokens.</t>
        <t> When a token maker receives a protected IKE request message with unknown IKE SPIs, it 
          SHOULD generate a new token that is identical to the previous token, and send it to the 
          requesting peer in an unprotected IKE message as described in <xref target="format_info"/>.</t>
        <t> When a token taker receives the QCD token in an unprotected notification, it MUST verify 
          that the TOKEN_SECRET_DATA matches the token stored with the matching IKE SA. If the 
          verification fails, or if the IKE SPIs in the message do not match any existing IKE SA,
          it SHOULD log the event. If it succeeds, it MUST silently delete the IKE SA associated 
          with the IKE_SPI fields, and all dependant child SAs. This event MAY also be logged. The 
          token taker MUST accept such tokens from any IP address and port combination, so as to 
          allow different kinds of high-availability configurations of the token maker.</t>
        <t> A supporting token taker MAY immediately create new SAs using an Initial exchange, 
          or it may wait for subsequent traffic to trigger the creation of new SAs.</t>

          interaction with IKEv2 Session Resumption (<xref target="RFC5723"/>).</t>

          <t> Note that the QCD_TOKEN notification is marked as optional because it is not required
            by this specification that every implementation be both token maker and token taker. 
            If only one peer sends the QCD token, then a reboot of the other peer will not be 
            recoverable by this method. This may be acceptable if traffic typically originates from 
            the other peer.</t>
          <t> In any case, the lack of a QCD_TOKEN notification MUST NOT be taken as an indication
            that the peer does not support this standard. Conversely, if a peer does not understand 
            this notification, it will simply ignore it. Therefore a peer MAY send this notification 
            freely, even if it does not know whether the other side supports it.</t>
          <t> The QCD_TOKEN notification is related to the IKE SA and MUST follow the AUTH payload
            and precede the Configuration payload and all payloads related to the child SA.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="format_rekey" title="Replacing Tokens After Rekey or Resumption">
          <t> After rekeying an IKE SA, the IKE SPIs are replaced, so the new SA also needs to have
            a token.  If only the responder in the rekey exchange is the token maker, this can be
            done within the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange. If the initiator is a token maker, then we 
            need an extra informational exchange.</t>
          <t> The following figure shows the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange for rekeying the IKE SA. Only
            the responder sends a QCD token.</t>
          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   request             --> SA, Ni, [KEi]

   response            <-- SA, Nr, [KEr], N(QCD_TOKEN)            
          ]]></artwork></figure>
          <t> If the initiator is also a token maker, it SHOULD soon initiate an INFORMATIONAL
            exchange as follows:</t>
          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   request             --> N(QCD_TOKEN)

   response            <--             
          ]]></artwork></figure>
          <t> For session resumption, as specified in <xref target="RFC5723"/>, the situation is 
            similar. The responder, which is necessarily the peer that has crashed, SHOULD send a 
            new ticket within the protected payload of the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange. If the 
            Initiator is also a token maker, it needs to send a QCD_TOKEN in a separate 
            INFORMATIONAL exchange.</t>
          <t> The INFORMATIONAL exchange described in this section can also be used if QCD tokens
            need to be replaced due to a key rollover. However, since token takers are required to
            verify at least 4 QCD tokens, this is only necessary if secret QCD keys are rolled over
            more than four times as often as IKE SAs are rekeyed.</t>

          <t> With some token generation methods, such as that described in <xref target="tg2"/>,
            a QCD token may sometimes become invalid, although the IKE SA is still perfectly valid.</t>
          <t> In such a case, the token maker MUST send the new token in a protected message under
            that IKE SA. That exchange could be a simple INFORMATIONAL, such as in the last figure 
            in the previous section, or else it can be part of a MOBIKE INFORMATIONAL exchange such
            as in the following figure taken from section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC4555"/> and

        <t> No token generation method is mandated by this document. Two method are documented in
          the following sub-sections, but they only serve as examples.</t>
        <t> The following lists the requirements from a token generation mechanism:<list style="symbols">
          <t> Tokens MUST be at least 16 octets long, and no more than 128 octets long, to 
            facilitate storage and transmission. Tokens SHOULD be indistinguishable from random data.</t>
          <t> It should not be possible for an external attacker to guess the QCD token generated
            by an implementation. Cryptographic mechanisms such as PRNG and hash functions are
            RECOMMENDED.</t>
          <t> The token maker, MUST be able to re-generate or retrieve the token based on the 
            IKE SPIs even after it reboots.</t>
          <t> The method of token generation MUST be such, that a collision of QCD tokens between 
            different pairs of IKE SPI will be highly unlikely.</t>
        </list></t>
        <section anchor="tg1" title="A Stateless Method of Token Generation">
          <t> This describes a stateless method of generating a token:<list style="symbols">
            <t> At installation or immediately after the first boot of the token maker, 32 random 
              octets are generated using a secure random number generator or a PRNG.</t>
            <t> Those 32 bytes, called the "QCD_SECRET", are stored in non-volatile storage on 
              the machine, and kept indefinitely.</t>
            <t> If key rollover is required by policy, the implementation MAY periodically generate
              a new QCD_SECRET and keep up to 3 previous generations. When sending an unprotected 
              QCD_TOKEN, as many as 4 notification payloads may be sent, each from a different
              QCD_SECRET.</t>
            <t> The TOKEN_SECRET_DATA is calculated as follows:</t></list></t>
          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
            
         TOKEN_SECRET_DATA = HASH(QCD_SECRET | SPI-I | SPI-R)

        </section>
        <section anchor="tg2" title="A Stateless Method with IP addresses">
          <t> This method is similar to the one in the previous section, except that the IP 
            address of the token taker is also added to the block being hashed. This has the 
            disadvantage that the token needs to be replaced (as described in 
            <xref target="format_mob"/>) whenever the token taker changes its address.</t>
          <t> The reason to use this method is described in <xref target="operation_with_ip"/>.
            When using this method, the TOKEN_SECRET_DATA field is calculated as follows:</t>
          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
            
      TOKEN_SECRET_DATA = HASH(QCD_SECRET | SPI-I | SPI-R | IPaddr-T)

          ]]></artwork></figure>
          <t> The IPaddr-T field specifies the IP address of the token taker. Secret rollover 
            considerations are similar to those in the previous section.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="toklifetime" title="Token Lifetime">
          <t> The token is associated with a single IKE SA, and SHOULD be deleted by the token taker
            when the SA is deleted or expires. More formally, the token is associated with the pair 
            (SPI-I, SPI-R).</t>

      <section anchor="backupgw" title="Backup Gateways">
        <t> Making crash detection and recovery quick is a worthy goal, but since rebooting a 
          gateway takes a non-zero amount of time, many implementations choose to have a stand-by 
          gateway ready to take over as soon as the primary gateway fails for any reason. 
          <xref target="cluster"/> describes consideration for such clusters of gateways with 
          synchronized state, but the rest of this section is relevant even when there is no 
          synchnorized state.</t>
        <t> If such a configuration is available, it is RECOMMENDED that the stand-by gateway be
          able to generate the same token as the active gateway. if the method described in 
          <xref target="tg1"/> is used, this means that the QCD_SECRET field is identical in both 
          gateways. This has the effect of having the crash recovery available immediately.</t>
        <t> Note that this refers to "high availability" configurations, where only one gateway is
          active at any given moment. This is different from "load sharing" configurations where
          more than one gateway is active at the same time. For load sharing configurations, please 
          see <xref target="sec_trans"/> for security considerations.</t>

      <section anchor="whynot" title="Alternative Solutions">
        <section anchor="newikesa" title="Initiating a new IKE SA">
        <t> Instead of sending a QCD token, we could have the rebooted implementation start an 
          Initial exchange with the peer, including the INITIAL_CONTACT notification. This would
          have the same effect, instructing the peer to erase the old IKE SA, as well as establishing
          a new IKE SA with fewer rounds.</t>
        <t> The disadvantage here, is that in IKEv2 an authentication exchange MUST have
          a piggy-backed Child SA set up. Since our use case is such that the rebooted implementation
          does not have traffic flowing to the peer, there are no good selectors for such a Child
          SA.</t>
        <t> Additionally, when authentication is asymmetric, such as when EAP is used, it is not 
          possible for the rebooted implementation to initiate IKE.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sir" title="SIR">
          <t> Another proposal that was considered for this work item is the SIR extension,
            which is described in <xref target="recovery"/>. Under that proposal, the non-rebooted 
            peer sends a non-protected query to the possibly rebooted peer, asking whether the IKE
            SA exists. The peer replies with either a positive or negative response, and the
            absence of a positive response, along with the existence of a negative response is 
            taken as proof that the IKE SA has really been lost.</t>
          <t> The working group preferred the QCD proposal to this one.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="bcerts" title="Birth Certificates">
          <t> Birth Certificates is a method of crash detection that has never been formally
            defined. Bill Sommerfeld suggested this idea in a mail to the IPsec mailing list on 
            August 7, 2000, in a thread discussing methods of crash detection:</t>
          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    If we have the system sign a "birth certificate" when it 
    reboots (including a reboot time or boot sequence number), 
    we could include that with a "bad spi" ICMP error and in 
    the negotiation of the IKE SA.
          ]]></artwork></figure>
          <t> We believe that this method would have some problems. First, it requires Alice to
            store the certificate, so as to be able to compare the public keys. That requires more
            storage than does a QCD token. Additionally, the public-key operations needed to verify 
            the self-signed certificates are more expensive for Alice.</t>
          <t> We believe that a symmetric-key operation such as proposed here is more light-weight
            and simple than that implied by the Birth Certificate idea.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="shortwait" title="Reducing Liveness Check Length">
          <t> Some have suggested that the RFC 4306 procedure described in <xref target="SCR"/> can
            be tweaked by requiring fewer retransmissions over a shorter period of time for cases
            of liveness check started because of an INVALID_SPI or INVALID_IKE_SPI notification.</t>
          <t> We believe that the default retransmission policy should represent a good balance 
            between the need for a timely discovery of a dead peer, and a low probability of false 
            detection. We expect the policy to be set to take the shortest time such that this 
            probability achieves a certain target. Therefore, reducing elapsed time and 
            retransmission count will create an unacceptably high probability of false detection,
            and this can be triggered by a single INVALID_IKE_SPI notification.</t>
          <t> Additionally, even if the retransmission policy is reduced to, say, one minute, it
            is still a very noticeable delay from a human perspective, from the time that the 
            gateway has come up until the tunnels are active, or from the time the backup 
            gateway has taken over until the tunnels are active.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="int_resume" title="Interaction with Session Resumption">
        <t> Session Resumption, specified in <xref target="RFC5723"/> proposes to make setting 
          up a new IKE SA consume less computing resources. This is particularly useful in the case 
          of a remote access gateway that has many tunnels. A failure of such a gateway would 
          require all these many remote access clients to establish an IKE SA either with the 
          rebooted gateway or with a backup gateway. This tunnel re-establishment should occur 
          within a short period of time, creating a burden on the remote access gateway. Session
          Resumption addresses this problem by having the clients store an encrypted derivative of 
          the IKE SA for quick re-establishment.</t>
        <t> What Session Resumption does not help, is the problem of detecting that the peer 
          gateway has failed. A failed gateway may go undetected for as long as the lifetime of a 
          child SA, because IPsec does not have packet acknowledgement, and applications cannot
          signal the IPsec layer that the tunnel "does not work". Before establishing a new 
          IKE SA using Session Resumption, a client should ascertain that the gateway has indeed 
          failed. This could be done using either a liveness check (as in RFC 4306) or using the 
          QCD tokens described in this document.</t>
        <t> A remote access client conforming to both specifications will store QCD tokens, as well
          as the Session Resumption ticket, if provided by the gateway. A remote access gateway 
          conforming to both specifications will generate a QCD token for the client. When the 
          gateway reboots, the client will discover this in either of two ways:<list style="numbers">
          <t> The client does regular liveness checks, or else the time for some other IKE exchange
            has come. Since the gateway is still down, the IKE exchange times out after several 
            minutes. In this case QCD does not help.</t>
          <t> Either the primary gateway or a backup gateway (see <xref target="backupgw"/>) 
            is ready and sends a QCD token to the client. In that case the client will quickly
            re-establish the IPsec tunnel, either with the rebooted primary gateway or the backup
            gateway as described in this document.
            </t></list></t>

      <section anchor="operation_who" title="Who should implement this specification">
        <t> Throughout this document, we have referred to reboot time alternatingly as the time that 
          the implementation crashes and the time when it is ready to process IPsec packets and IKE 
          exchanges. Depending on the hardware and software platforms and the cause of the reboot, 
          rebooting may take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. If the implementation
          is down for a long time, the benefit of this protocol extension is reduced. For this reason
          critical systems should implement backup gateways as described in 
          <xref target="backupgw"/>.</t>
        <t> Implementing the "token maker" side of QCD makes sense for IKE implementation where protected
          connections originate from the peer, such as inter-domain VPNs and remote access gateways.
          Implementing the "token taker" side of QCD makes sense for IKE implementations where protected
          connections originate, such as inter-domain VPNs and remote access clients.</t>
        <t> To clarify the requirements: <list style="symbols"> 
          <t> A remote-access client MUST be a token taker and MAY be a token maker.</t>
          <t> A remote-access gateway MAY be a token taker and MUST be a token maker.</t>
          <t> An inter-domain VPN gateway MUST be both token maker and token taker.</t></list></t>
        <t> In order to limit the effects of DoS attacks, a token taker SHOULD limit the rate
          of QCD_TOKENs verified from a particular source. </t>
        <t> If excessive amounts of IKE requests protected with unknown IKE SPIs arrive at a token
          maker, the IKE module SHOULD revert to the behavior described in section 2.21 of 
          <xref target="IKEv2bis"/> and either send an INVALID_IKE_SPI notification, or ignore it 
          entirely.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="operation_esp" title="Response to unknown child SPI">
        <t> After a reboot, it is more likely that an implementation receives IPsec packets than 
          IKE packets. In that case, the rebooted implementation will send an INVALID_SPI
          notification, triggering a liveness check.  The token will only be sent in a response to
          the liveness check, thus requiring an extra round-trip.</t>
        <t> To avoid this, an implementation that has access to enough non-volatile storage MAY 
          store a mapping of child SPIs to owning IKE SPIs, or to generated tokens. If such a 
          mapping is available and persistent across reboots, the rebooted implementation SHOULD 
          respond to the IPsec packet with an INVALID_SPI notification, along with the appropriate 
          QCD_Token notifications. A token taker SHOULD verify the QCD token that arrives with an 
          INVALID_SPI notification the same as if it arrived with the IKE SPIs of the parent IKE 
          SA.</t>
        <t> However, a persistent storage module might not be updated in a timely manner, and 
          could be populated with tokens relating to IKE SPIs that have already been rekeyed. A 
          token taker MUST NOT take an invalid QCD Token sent along with an INVALID_SPI 
          notification as evidence that the peer is either malfunctioning or attacking, but it 
          SHOULD limit the rate at which such notifications are processed.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="operation_with_ip" title="Using Tokens that Depend on IP Addresses">
        <t> This section describes the rationale for token generation methods such as the one 
          described in <xref target="tg2"/>. Note that this section merely provides a possible
          rationale, and does not specify or recommend any kind of configuration.</t>
        <t> Some configurations of security gateway use a load-sharing cluster of hosts, all 
          sharing the same IP addresses, where the SAs (IKE and child) are not synchronized between 
          the cluster members. In such a configuration, a single member does not know about all the 
          IKE SAs that are active for the configuration. A load balancer (usually a networking 
          switch) sends IKE and IPsec packets to the several members based on source IP address.</t>
        <t> In such a configuration, an attacker can send a forged protected IKE packet with the
          IKE SPIs of an existing IKE SA, but from a different IP address. This packet will likely
          be processed by a different cluster member from the one that owns the IKE SA. Since no 
          IKE SA state is stored on this member, it will send a QCD token to the attacker. If the
          QCD token does not depend on IP address, this token can immediately be used to tell the
          token taker to tear down the IKE SA using an unprotected QCD_TOKEN notification.</t>
        <t> To thwart this possible attack, such configurations should use a method that considers
          the taker&apos;s IP address, such as the method described in <xref target="tg2"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <section anchor="sec_handling" title="QCD Token Generation and Handling">
        <t> Tokens MUST be hard to guess. This is critical, because if an attacker can guess the 
          token associated with an IKE SA, she can tear down the IKE SA and associated tunnels at
          will. When the token is delivered in the IKE_AUTH exchange, it is encrypted. When it is
          sent again in an unprotected notification, it is not, but that is the last time this
          token is ever used.</t>
        <t> An aggregation of some tokens generated by one maker together with the related IKE SPIs
          MUST NOT give an attacker the ability to guess other tokens. Specifically, if one taker 
          does not properly secure the QCD tokens and an attacker gains access to them, this
          attacker MUST NOT be able to guess other tokens generated by the same maker. This is the
          reason that the QCD_SECRET in <xref target="tg1"/> needs to be sufficiently long.</t>
        <t> The token taker MUST store the token in a secure manner. No attacker should be able to
          gain access to a stored token.</t>
        <t> The QCD_SECRET MUST be protected from access by other parties. Anyone gaining
          access to this value will be able to delete all the IKE SAs for this token maker.</t>
        <t> The QCD token is sent by the rebooted peer in an unprotected message. A message like 
          that is subject to modification, deletion and replay by an attacker. However, these 
          attacks will not compromise the security of either side. Modification is meaningless
          because a modified token is simply an invalid token. Deletion will only cause the 
          protocol not to work, resulting in a delay in tunnel re-establishment as described in
          <xref target="SCR"/>. Replay is also meaningless, because the IKE SA has been deleted
          after the first transmission.</t>

        <t> A token maker MUST NOT send a QCD token in an unprotected message for an existing IKE

        <t> This requirement is obvious and easy in the case of a single gateway. However, some 
          implementations use a load balancer to divide the load between several physical gateways.
          It MUST NOT be possible even in such a configuration to trick one gateway into sending 
          a QCD token for an IKE SA which is valid on another gateway.</t>
        <t> This document does not specify how a load sharing sharing configuration of IPsec 
          gateways would work, but in order to support this specification, all members MUST be able
          to tell whether a particular IKE SA is active anywhere in the cluster. One way to do it

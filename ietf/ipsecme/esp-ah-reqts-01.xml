<abstract>

<t>This Internet Draft is standards track proposal to update to
the Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP
and AH; it also adds usage guidance to help in the selection of
these algorithms.</t>

<t>The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header
(AH) protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to provide
confidentiality and/or data origin authentication to protected data
communications in the IP Security (IPsec) architecture. To ensure
interoperability between disparate implementations, the IPsec standard
specifies a set of mandatory-to- implement algorithms. This document
specifies the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP
and AH, specifies algorithms that should be implemented because they may
be promoted to mandatory at some future time, and also recommends
against the implementation of some obsolete algorithms. Usage guidance
is also provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their
security goals through appropriate choices of cryptographic algorithms.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303"/> and
the Authentication Header (AH) <xref target="RFC4302"/> are the
mechanisms for applying cryptographic protection to data being sent over
an IPsec Security Association (SA) <xref target="RFC4301"/>.</t>

<t>To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is
necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms. This
ensures that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations
will have in common. This document specifies the current set of
mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies algorithms
that should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at
some future time, and also recommends against the implementation of some
obsolete algorithms. Usage guidance is also provided to help the user of
ESP and AH best achieve their security goals through appropriate choices
of mechanisms.</t>

<t>The nature of cryptography is that new algorithms surface
continuously and existing algorithms are continuously attacked. An
algorithm believed to be strong today may be demonstrated to be weak
tomorrow. Given this, the choice of mandatory-to-implement algorithm
should be conservative so as to minimize the likelihood of it being
compromised quickly. Thought should also be given to performance
considerations as many uses of IPsec will be in environments where
performance is a concern.</t>

<t>The ESP and AH mandatory-to-implement algorithm(s) may need to change
over time to adapt to new developments in cryptography. For this reason,
the specification of the mandatory-to-implement algorithms is not
included in the main IPsec, ESP, or AH specifications, but is instead
placed in this document. Ideally, the mandatory-to-implement algorithm
of tomorrow should already be available in most implementations of IPsec
by the time it is made mandatory. To facilitate this, this document
identifies such algorithms, as they are known today. There is no
guarantee that the algorithms that we believe today may be mandatory in
the future will in fact become so. All algorithms known today are
subject to cryptographic attack and may be broken in the future.</t>

<section title="Requirements Language">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

<t>Following <xref target="RFC4835"/>, we define some additional key
words:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="MUST-"> This term means the same as MUST. However, we
expect that at some point in the future this algorithm will no
longer be a MUST.</t>

<t hangText="SHOULD+"> This term means the same as SHOULD.
However, it is likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be
promoted at some future time to be a MUST.</t>

<t hangText="SHOULD-"> This term means the same as SHOULD.
However, it is likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD- will be
deprecated to a MAY or worse in a future version of this document.

<section title="Usage Guidance">

<t>Since ESP and AH can be used in several different ways, this document
provides guidance on the best way to utilize these mechanisms.</t>

<t>ESP can provide confidentiality, data origin authentication, or the
combination of both of those security services. AH provides only data
origin authentication. Background information on those security services
is available <xref target="RFC4949"/>. In the following, we shorten
`data origin authentication&rsquo; to `authentication&rsquo;.</t>

<t>Both confidentiality and authentication SHOULD be provided. If
confidentiality is not needed, then authentication MAY be provided.
Confidentiality without authentication is not effective <xref
target="DP07"/> and SHOULD NOT be used. We describe each of these cases
in more detail below.</t>

<t>To provide confidentiality and authentication, an authenticated
encryption transform SHOULD be used in ESP, in conjunction with NULL
authentication. Alternatively, an ESP encryption transform and ESP
authentication transform MAY be used together (provided that neither
transform is NULL). If authentication on the IP header is needed in
conjunction with confidentiality of higher-layer data, then AH SHOULD be
used in addition to the transforms recommended above. It is NOT
RECOMMENDED to use ESP with NULL authentication in conjunction with AH;
some configurations of this combination of services have been shown to
be insecure <xref target="PD10"> </xref>.</t>

<t>To provide authentication without confidentiality, an authentication
transform MUST be used in either ESP or AH. It is not possible to
provide effective confidentiality without authentication, because the
lack of authentication undermines the efficacy of encryption <xref
target="B96"/><xref target="V02"/>. An encryption transform MUST NOT be
used with a NULL authentication transform (unless the encryption
transform is an authenticated encryption transform).</t>

<t>Triple-DES SHOULD NOT be used in any scenario in which
multiple gigabytes of data will be encrypted with a single
key.  As a 64-bit block cipher, it leaks information about
plaintexts above that "birthday bound" <xref target="M13"/>.
Triple-DES CBC is listed as a MAY implement for the sake of
backwards compatibility, but its use is discouraged.</t>

</section>

<section title="Rationale">

<t>This section explains the principles behind the implementation
requirements described above.</t>


<t>The algorithms listed as MAY-implement are not meant to be
endorsed over other non-standard alternatives.  All of the
algorithms that appeared in <xref target="RFC4835"/> are
included in this document, for the sake of continuity.  In some
cases, these algorithms have moved from being SHOULD-implement
to MAY-implement algorithms.</t>

<section title="Authenticated Encryption">

<t>This document encourages the use of authenticated encryption algorithms
because they can provide significant efficiency and throughput
advantages, and the tight binding between authentication and
encryption can be a security advantage <xref target="RFC5116"/>.</t>

<t> AES-GCM [RFC4106] brings significant performance benefits <xref
target="KKGEGD"/>, has been incorporated into IPsec recommendations
<xref target="RFC6379"/> and has emerged as the preferred
authenticated encryption method in IPsec and other standards.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="TripleDES" title="Encryption Transforms">

<t>Since ESP encryption is optional, support for the "NULL" algorithm
is required to maintain consistency with the way services are
negotiated. Note that while authentication and encryption can each be
"NULL", they MUST NOT both be "NULL" <xref target="RFC4301"/> <xref
target="H10"/>.</t>

<t>AES Counter Mode (AES-CTR) is an efficient encryption method, but
it provides no authentication capability. The AES-GCM authenticated
encryption method has all of the advantages of AES-CTR, while also
providing authentication. Thus this document moves AES-CTR from a SHOULD
to a MAY.</t>

<t>The Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) is obsolete
because of its small block size; as with all 64-bit block
ciphers, it SHOULD NOT be used to encrypt more than one
gigabyte of data with a single key <xref target="M13"/>.  Its
key size is smaller than that of the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES), while at the same time its performance and
efficiency is worse.  Thus, its use in new implementations is
discouraged.</t>

<t>The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is obsolete because of its small
key size and small block size. There have been publicly demonstrated
and open-design special-purpose cracking hardware. Therefore, its use
is discouraged.</t>

</section>

<section title="Authentication Transforms">

<t>AES-GMAC provides good security along with performance advantages,
even over HMAC-MD5. In addition, it uses the same internal components
as AES-GCM and is easy to implement in a way that shares components
with that authenticated encryption algorithm.</t>

<t>The MD5 hash function has been found to not meet its goal of
collision resistance; it is so weak that its use in digital signatures
is highly discouraged <xref target="RFC6151"/>. There have been
theoretical results against HMAC-MD5, but that message authentication
code does not seem to have a practical vulnerability. Thus, it may not
be urgent to remove HMAC-MD5 from the existing protocols.</t>

<t>SHA-1 has been found to not meet its goal of collision resistance.
However, HMAC-SHA-1 does not rely on this property, and HMAC-SHA-1 is
believed to be secure.</t>

<t>The HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512 are believed to
provide a good security margin, and they perform adequately on many
platforms. However, these algorithms are not recommended for implementation
in this document, because HMAC-SHA-1 support is widespread and its
security is good, AES-GMAC provides good security with better
performance, and Authenticated Encryption algorithms do not need any
authentication methods.</t>

<t>AES-XCBC has not seen widespread deployment, despite being
previously being recommended as a SHOULD+ in RFC4305. Thus this draft
lists it only as a SHOULD.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Algorithm Diversity">

<t>When the AES cipher was first adopted, it was decided to
continue encouraging the implementation of Triple-DES, in
order to provide algorithm diversity.  But the passage of time
has eroded the viability of Triple-DES as an alternative to
AES.  As it is a 64-bit block cipher, its security is
inadequate at high data rates (see <xref target="TripleDES"/>).
Its performance in software and FPGAs is considerably worse
than that of AES.  Since it would not be possible to use
Triple-DES as an alternative to AES in high data rate
environments, or in environments where its performance could
not keep up the requirements, the rationale of retaining Triple-DES
to provide algorithm diversity is disappearing.  (Of course,
this does not change the rationale of retaining Triple-DES
in IPsec implementations for backwards compability.)</t>

<t>Recent discussions in the IETF have started
considering how to make the selection of a
different cipher that could provide algorithm diversity in
IPsec and other IETF standards.  That work is expected
to take a long time and involve discussions among many
participants and organizations.</t>

<t>It is important to bear in mind that it is very highly
unlikely that an exploitable flaw will be found in AES (e.g.,
a flaw that required less than a terabyte of known plaintext,
when AES is used in a conventional mode of operation).  The
only reason that algorithm diversity deserves any
consideration is because the problems that would be caused if
such a flaw were found would be so large.</t>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>The security of a system that uses cryptography depends on both the
strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of the
keys used with those algorithms. The security also depends on the
engineering and administration of the protocol used by the system to
ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the security
of the overall system.</t>

<t>This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
algorithms for the use of ESP and AH, specifically with the selection of
mandatory-to-implement algorithms. The algorithms identified in this
document as "MUST implement" or "SHOULD implement" are not known to be
broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far leads us
to believe that they will likely remain secure into the foreseeable
future. However, this is not necessarily forever. We would therefore
expect that new revisions of this document will be issued from time to
time that reflect the current best practice in this area.</t>

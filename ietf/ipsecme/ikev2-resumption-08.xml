    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a
      certain computational and communication overhead with respect
      to the number of round-trips required and the cryptographic
      operations involved. In particular the Extensible
      Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication in
      remote access cases, which increases latency.</t>
      <t>To re-establish security associations (SA) upon a failure
      recovery condition is time-consuming, especially when an
      IPsec peer, such as a VPN gateway, needs to re-establish a
      large number of SAs with various end points. A high number of
      concurrent sessions might cause additional problems for an
      IPsec responder. Usability is also affected when the re-establishment
      of an IKE SA involves user interaction for reauthentication.</t>
      <t>In many failure cases it would be useful to provide an
      efficient way to resume an interrupted IKE/IPsec session.
      This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a
      client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly
      efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE
      SA.</t>
      <t>
   The client (IKEv2 initiator) stores the state about the previous
   IKE SA locally. The gateway (IKEv2 responder) has two options for
   maintaining the IKEv2 state about the previous IKE SA:
      </t>
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
   <t>In the "ticket by reference" approach, the gateway stores the state
     locally, and gives the client a protected and opaque reference (e.g., an index
     to the gateway's table) that the gateway can later use to find the
     state. The client includes this opaque reference when it resumes
     the session.</t>

   <t>In the "ticket by value" approach, the gateway stores its state in a ticket
     (data structure) that is encrypted and integrity-protected by a
     key known only to the gateway. The ticket is passed to the client
     (who treats the ticket as an opaque string), and sent back to
     the gateway when the session is resumed. The gateway can then
     decrypt the ticket and recover the state.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        <t>
   Note that the client behaves identically in both cases, and in
   general does not know which approach the gateway is using.  Since
   the ticket (or reference) is only interpreted by the same party
   that created it, this document does not specify the exact format
   for it. However, Appendix A contains examples for both "ticket by
   reference" and "ticket by value" formats.
      </t>
      <t>This approach is similar to the one taken by TLS session
      resumption
      <xref target="RFC5077" /> with the required adaptations for
      IKEv2, e.g., to accommodate the two-phase protocol structure.
      We have borrowed heavily from that specification.</t>
      <t>The proposed solution should additionally meet the
      following goals:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Using only symmetric cryptography to minimize CPU
          consumption.</t>
          <t>Providing cryptographic agility.</t>
          <t>Having no negative impact on IKEv2 security
          features.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The following are non-goals of this solution:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Failover from one gateway to another. This use case may
        be added in a future specification.</t>
        <t>Providing load balancing among gateways.</t>
        <t>Specifying how a client detects the need for
        resumption.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>This document uses terminology defined in

      <t>In this document we use the term "ticket" and thereby refer

    <section title="Usage Scenario" anchor="usage">
      <t>This specification envisions two usage scenarios for
      efficient IKEv2 and IPsec SA session re-establishment.</t>
      <t>The first is similar to the use case specified in Section
      1.1.3 of the IKEv2 specification
      <xref target="RFC4306" />, where the IPsec tunnel mode is
      used to establish a secure channel between a remote access
      client and a gateway; the traffic flow may be between the
      client and entities beyond the gateway. This scenario is
      further discussed below.</t>
      <t>The second use case focuses on the usage of transport (or
      tunnel) mode to secure the communicate between two end points
      (e.g., two servers). The two endpoints have a client-server
      relationship with respect to a protocol that runs using the
      protections afforded by the IPsec SA.</t>

      </t>
      <t>In the first use case above,
      an end host (an entity with a host
      implementation of IPsec
      <xref target="RFC4301" />) establishes a tunnel mode IPsec SA
      with a gateway in a remote network using IKEv2. The end host
      in this scenario is sometimes referred to as a remote access
      client. At a later stage when a client needs to re-establish
      the IKEv2 session it may choose to establish IPsec SAs using
      a full IKEv2 exchange or the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange
      (shown in
      <xref target="Case1GWfig" />).</t>
      <t>
        For either of the above use cases, there are multiple possible
        situations where the mechanism specified in this document
  could be useful. These include the following (note that this list is not
  meant to be exhaustive, and any particular deployment may not care
  about all of these):
  </t>
    <t>
    <list style="symbols">

  <t> If a client temporarily loses network connectivity (and the IKE
    SA times out through the liveness test facility, a.k.a. "dead peer detection"),
    this mechanism could be used to re-establish the
    SA with less overhead (network, CPU, authentication infrastructure)
    and without requiring user interaction for authentication. </t>

  <t> If the connectivity problems affect a large number of clients
    (e.g., a large remote access VPN gateway), when the connectivity
    is restored, all the clients might reconnect almost simultaneously.
    This mechanism could be used to reduce the load spike for
    cryptographic operations and authentication infrastructure. </t>

  <t> Losing connectivity can also be predictable and planned; for
    example, putting a laptop to "stand-by" mode before travelling.
    This mechanism could be used to re-establish the SA when
    the laptop is switched back on (again, with less overhead and
    without requiring user interaction for authentication). However such user-level
    "resumption" may often be disallowed by policy. Moreover, this document
    requires the client to destroy the ticket when the user explicitly "logs out"
    (<xref target="lifecycle"/>).</t>

    <section title="Protocol Sequences">
      <t>This section provides protocol details and contains the
      normative parts. This document defines two protocol
      exchanges, namely requesting a ticket, see
      <xref target="request-ticket" />, and presenting a ticket,
      see
      <xref target="present-ticket" />.</t>
      <section anchor="request-ticket" title="Requesting a Ticket">
        <t>A client MAY request a ticket in the following
        exchanges:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>In an IKE_AUTH exchange, as shown in the example
            message exchange in
            <xref target="request-ticket-example" /> below.</t>
            <t>In a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, when an IKE SA is
            rekeyed (and only when this exchange is initiated
            by the client).</t>
            <t>In an Informational exchange at any time, e.g. if
            the gateway previously replied with an N(TICKET_ACK)
            instead of providing a ticket, or when the ticket
            lifetime is about to expire, or following a gateway-initiated
            IKE rekey. All such
            Informational exchanges MUST be initiated by the client.</t>
            <t>While resuming an IKE session, i.e. in the IKE_AUTH exchange that follows
            an IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange, see
            <xref target="ike-auth" />.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Normally, a client requests a ticket in the third
        message of an IKEv2 exchange (the first of IKE_AUTH).
        <xref target="request-ticket-example" /> shows the message
        exchange for this typical case.</t>

        <t>Again, the exchange type in HDR is set to
        'IKE_SESSION_RESUME'. The responder copies the SPIi value
        from the request, and the SPIr value is set to a new, unique
        value.</t>
        <t>Where not specified otherwise, the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange behaves
        exactly like the

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>The client MAY resume the IKE exchange from any IP address and port,
            regardless of its original address. The gateway MAY reject the resumed
            exchange if its policy depends on the client's address
            (although this rarely makes sense).</t>
            <t>The first message MAY be rejected in denial of
            service situations, with the initiator instructed to send
            a cookie.</t>
            <t>Notifications normally associated with IKE_SA_INIT
            can be sent. In particular, NAT detection payloads.</t>
            <t>
            The client's NAT traversal status SHOULD be determined anew in
            IKE_SESSION_RESUME. If NAT is detected,
            the initiator switches to UDP encapsulation on port 4500, as per
            <xref target="RFC4306"/>, Sec. 2.23. NAT status is explicitly not part of the session
            resumption state.
            </t>
            <t>The SPI values and Message ID fields behave
            similarly to IKE_SA_INIT.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Although the IKE SA is not fully valid until the completion of the IKE_AUTH
        exchange, the peers must create much of the SA state (<xref target="ike-sa"/>) now.
        Specifically, the SK_xx values are required to protect the IKE_AUTH payloads.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="ike-auth" title="IKE_AUTH Exchange">
        <t>Following the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange, the client MUST initiate an IKE_AUTH
        exchange, which is largely as specified in
        <xref target="RFC4306" />. This section lists the differences and constraints
        compared to the base document.</t>
        <t>The value of the AUTH payload is derived in a manner
        similar to the usage of IKEv2 pre-shared secret
        authentication:</t>
        <figure>

            <![CDATA[
         AUTH = prf(SK_px, <message octets>)

</artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>Each of the initiator and responder uses its own SK_p
        value, taken from the newly generated IKE SA, <xref target="crypto-resumed-sa" />.</t>
        <t>The exact material to be signed is defined in Section
        2.15 of
        <xref target="RFC4306" />. </t>
        <t>The IDi value sent in the IKE_AUTH exchange MUST
        be identical to the value included in the ticket.
        A CERT payload MUST NOT be included in this exchange, and therefore
        a new IDr value cannot be negotiated (since it would not be authenticated).
        As a result, the IDr value sent (by the gateway, and optionally by the client)
        in this exchange MUST
        also be identical to the value included in the ticket.</t>
        <t>When resuming a session, a client will typically request
        a new ticket immediately, so that it is able to resume the
        session again in the case of a second failure.
        The N(TICKET_REQUEST) and N(TICKET_LT_OPAQUE) notifications
        will be included in the
        IKE_AUTH exchange that follows the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange, with
        similar behavior to a ticket request during a regular IKE exchange,
        <xref target="request-ticket" />. The returned ticket (if any) will correspond to the IKE
        SA created per the rules described in
        <xref target="ike-sa" />.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Epilogue">
        <t>Following the IKE_AUTH exchange, a new IKE SA is
        created by both parties, see
        <xref target="ike-sa" />, and a Child SA is derived, per Section 2.17 of
        <xref target="RFC4306" />.</t>
        <t>When the responder receives a ticket for an IKE SA that
        is still active and if the responder accepts it (i.e. following successful completion
        of the IKE_AUTH exchange), the
        old SA SHOULD be silently deleted without sending a DELETE
        informational exchange. Consequently, all the dependent
        IPsec Child SAs are also deleted.</t>

    <section title="IKE and IPsec State After Resumption"
               anchor="ike-sa">
        <t>During the resumption process, both peers create IKE and IPsec state for the resumed
        IKE SA. Although the SA is only completed following a successful IKE_AUTH
        exchange, many of its components are created earlier, notably the SA's crypto material
        (<xref target="crypto-resumed-sa"/>).
        </t>
        <t>When a ticket is presented, the gateway needs to obtain
        the ticket state. In case a ticket by reference was
        provided by the client, the gateway needs to resolve the
        reference in order to obtain this state. In case
        the client has already provided a ticket by value, the gateway can
        parse the ticket to obtain the state directly. In either case, the gateway needs to
        process the ticket state in order to restore the state
        of the old IKE SA, and the client retrieves the same state from
        its local store.
        </t>
    <t>
    The following table describes the IKE and IPsec state of the
    peers after session resumption, and how it is related to their state before the IKE SA was
    interrupted. When the table mentions that a certain state item is taken "from the ticket",
    this should be construed as:

    <section title="Ticket Handling">
      <section anchor="content" title="Ticket Content">
        <t>When passing a ticket by value to the client, the ticket
        content MUST be integrity protected and encrypted.</t>
        <t>A ticket
        by reference does not need to be encrypted, as it does not
        contain any sensitive material, such as keying material.
        However, access to the storage where that sensitive
        material is stored MUST be protected so that only
        authorized access is allowed. We note that such a
        ticket is analogous to the concept of 'stub', as defined in
        <xref target="I-D.xu-ike-sa-sync" />, or the concept of a
        Session ID from TLS.</t>
        <t>Although not strictly required for cryptographic protection,
        it is RECOMMENDED to integrity-protect the ticket by reference. Failing to do so
        could result in various security vulnerabilities on the gateway side, depending
        on the format of the reference. Potential vulnerabilities include
        access by the gateway to unintended URLs (similar to cross-site scripting) or SQL
        injection.
        </t>
        <t>When the state is passed by value, the ticket MUST
        encode all state information marked "from the ticket" in the table on
        <xref target="ike-sa"/>.
        The same state MUST be stored in the ticket store,
        in the case of ticket by reference.
        </t>
        <t>
        A ticket by value MUST include a protected expiration time, which
        is an absolute time value and SHOULD correspond to the value
        included in the TICKET_LT_OPAQUE payload.
        </t>
        <t>The ticket by value MUST additionally include a key identity field,
        so that keys for ticket encryption and authentication can be
        changed, and when necessary, algorithms can be
        replaced.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Ticket Identity and Lifecycle"
      anchor="lifecycle">
        <t>Each ticket is associated with a single IKE SA. In
        particular, when an IKE SA is deleted by the client or the gateway,
        the client MUST
        delete its stored ticket. Similarly, when credentials associated
        with the IKE SA are invalidated (e.g. when a user logs out),
        the ticket MUST be deleted. When the IKE SA is rekeyed the
        ticket is invalidated, and the client SHOULD request a new
        ticket. When a client does not follow these rules, it might present
        an invalid ticket to the gateway. See <xref target="ticket-revocation"/>
        for more about this issue.</t>
        <t>The lifetime of the ticket sent by the gateway SHOULD be the minimum of
        the IKE SA lifetime (per the gateway's local policy) and
        its re-authentication time, according to
        <xref target="RFC4478" />. Even if neither of these are
        enforced by the gateway, a finite lifetime MUST be
        specified for the ticket.</t>
        <t>
        The key that is used to protect the ticket MUST have a
        lifetime that is significantly longer than the lifetime of
        an IKE SA.</t>
        <t>In normal operation, the client will request a ticket when establishing the initial
        IKE SA, and then every time the SA is rekeyed or re-established
        because of re-authentication.

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
      <t>This section addresses security issues related to the
      usage of a ticket.</t>
      <section title="Stolen Tickets">
        <t>A man-in-the-middle may try to eavesdrop on an exchange
        to obtain a ticket by value and use it to establish a
        session with the IKEv2 responder. Since all exchanges where the client
        obtains a ticket are encrypted, this is only possible
        by listening in on a client's use of
        the ticket to resume a session. However, since the ticket's
        contents are encrypted and the attacker does not know the
        corresponding secret key, a stolen ticket cannot be used by
        an attacker to successfully resume a session. An IKEv2
        responder MUST use strong encryption and integrity
        protection of the ticket to prevent an attacker from
        obtaining the ticket's contents, e.g., by using a brute
        force attack.</t>
        <t>A ticket by reference does not need to be encrypted.
        When an adversary is able to eavesdrop on a resumption attempt, as
        described in the previous paragraph, then the ticket by
        reference may be obtained. A ticket by reference cannot be used by
        an attacker to successfully resume a session, for the
        same reasons as for a ticket by value.
        Moreover, the adversary MUST NOT be able
        to resolve the ticket via the reference, i.e., access
        control MUST be enforced to ensure disclosure only to
        authorized entities.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Forged Tickets">
        <t>A malicious user could forge or alter a ticket by value
        in order to resume a session, to extend its lifetime, to
        impersonate as another user, or to gain additional
        privileges. This attack is not possible if the content of
        the ticket by value is protected using a strong integrity
        protection algorithm.</t>
        <t>In case of a ticket by reference an adversary may
        attempt to construct a fake ticket by reference to point to
        state information stored by the IKEv2 responder. This
        attack will fail because the adversary is not in possession
        of the keying material associated with the IKEv2 SA. As noted in
        <xref target="content"/>, it is often useful to integrity-protect
        the ticket by reference, too.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Denial of Service Attacks">
        <t>An adversary could generate and send a large number of
        tickets by value to a gateway for verification. To minimize
        the possibility of such denial of service, ticket
        verification should be lightweight (e.g., using efficient
        symmetric key cryptographic algorithms).</t>
        <t>When an adversary chooses to send a large number of
        tickets by reference then this may lead to an amplification
        attack as the IKEv2 responder is forced to resolve the reference to a
        ticket in order to determine that the adversary is not in
        possession of the keying material corresponding to the
        stored state or that the reference is void. To minimize
        this attack, the protocol to resolve the reference should be
        as lightweight as possible and should not generate a large
        number of messages.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Detecting the Need for Resumption">
      <t>Detecting when an old IKE SA is no longer usable and needs to be resumed
      is out of scope of the current document. However, clients are warned against implementing
      a more liberal
      policy than that used to detect failed IKE SAs (Sec. 2.4 of RFC 4306). In particular,
      untrusted messages MUST NOT be relied upon to make this decision.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Key Management for Tickets By Value ">
        <t>A full description of the management of the keys used to
        protect the ticket by value is beyond the scope of this
        document. A list of RECOMMENDED practices is given below.
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The keys should be generated securely following the
          randomness recommendations in
          <xref target="RFC4086" />.</t>
          <t>The keys and cryptographic protection algorithms
          should be at least 128 bits in strength.</t>
          <t>The keys should not be used for any other purpose than
          generating and verifying tickets.</t>
          <t>The keys should be changed regularly.</t>
          <t>The keys should be changed if the ticket format or
          cryptographic protection algorithms change.</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>
      <section title="Ticket Lifetime">
        <t>An IKEv2 responder controls the validity period of the
        state information by attaching a lifetime to a ticket. The
        chosen lifetime is based on the operational and security
        requirements of the environment in which this IKEv2
        extension is deployed. The responder provides information
        about the ticket lifetime to the IKEv2 initiator, allowing
        it to manage its tickets.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="ticket-revocation" title="Ticket Revocation">
        <t>A misbehaving client could present a ticket in its possession to the gateway resulting
        in session resumption,
        even though the IKE SA associated with this ticket had previously been
        deleted. This is disallowed by <xref target="lifecycle"/>.
        This issue is unique to ticket by value cases, since a ticket by reference will have been
        deleted from the ticket store.</t>
        <t>To avoid this issue for ticket by value, an Invalid Ticket List (ITL)
        may be maintained by the gateway, see
   <xref target="I-D.rescorla-stateless-tokens" />.  This can be a simple
   blacklist of revoked tickets. Alternatively, <xref target="I-D.rescorla-stateless-tokens" />
   suggests to use Bloom Filters <xref target="Bloom70"/> to maintain the list in constant space.
   Management of such lists is outside
   the scope of the current document.  Note that a policy that requires
   tickets to have shorter lifetimes (e.g., 1 hour) significantly
   mitigates this issue.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Ticket by Value Format">
        <t>The ticket's format is not defined by this document, since
        this is not required for interoperability.
        However great care must be taken when defining a ticket format
        such that the requirements outlined in
        <xref target="content" /> are met. The ticket by value MUST have its
        integrity and confidentiality protected with strong
        cryptographic techniques to prevent a breach in the
        security of the system.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Identity Privacy, Anonymity, and Unlinkability">

        <t>Since opaque state information is passed around between
        the IKEv2 initiator and the IKEv2 responder it is important
        that leakage of information, such as the identities of an
        IKEv2 initiator and a responder, MUST be avoided.</t>
        <t>When an IKEv2 initiator presents a ticket as part of the
        IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange, confidentiality is not
        provided for the exchange. There is thereby the possibility
        for an on-path adversary to observe multiple exchange
        handshakes where the same state information is used and
        therefore to conclude that they belong to the same
        communication end points.</t>
        <t>This document therefore requires that the ticket be
        presented to the IKEv2 responder only once; under normal circumstances
        (e.g. no active attacker), there should be no multiple use
        of the same ticket.</t>
        <t>We are not aware of additional security issues associated with ticket reuse:
        the protocol guarantees freshness of the generated crypto material even in such cases.
        As noted in <xref target="prologue"/>, the gateway SHOULD prevent multiple uses
        of the same ticket. But this is only an extra precaution,
        to ensure that clients do not implement reuse. In other
        words, the gateway is not expected to cache old tickets for extended periods of time.</t>

  <abstract>

    <t>When IKEv2 is used for remote VPN access (client to VPN
    gateway), the gateway assigns the client an IP address from the
    internal network using IKEv2 configuration payloads.  The
    configuration payloads specified in RFC 4306 work well for IPv4,
    but make it difficult to use certain features of IPv6. 
    This document specifies new configuration attributes for
    IKEv2 that allows the VPN gateway to assign IPv6 prefixes to
    clients, enabling all features of IPv6 to be used with the
    client-gateway "virtual link".</t>

<section title="Introduction and Problem Statement">

  <t>In typical remote access VPN use (client to VPN gateway), the
  client needs an IP address in the network protected by the security
  gateway.  IKEv2 includes a feature called "configuration payloads"
  that allows the gateway to dynamically assign a temporary address to
  the client <xref target="IKEv2"/>.</t>

  <t>For IPv4, the message exchange would look as follows:</t>

  <t>The IPv4 case has been implemented by various vendors, and in
  general works well. IKEv2 also defines almost identical
  configuration payloads for IPv6:</t>

  <t>In other words, IPv6 is basically treated as IPv4 with larger
  addresses. As noted in <xref target="RFC4718"/>, this does not fully
  follow the "normal IPv6 way of doing things", and it complicates or
  prevents using certain features of IPv6. <xref target="limitations"/>
  describes the limitations in detail.</t>

  <t>This document specifies new configuration attributes for
  IKEv2 that allows the VPN gateway to assign IPv6 prefixes to
  clients, enabling all features of IPv6 to be used with the
  client-gateway "virtual link".</t>

</section>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<section title="Terminology">

  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
  NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
  in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
  target='KEYWORDS'/>.</t>

  <t>When messages containing IKEv2 payloads are described, optional
  payloads are shown in brackets (for instance, "[FOO]"), and a plus
  sign indicates that a payload can be repeated one or more times (for
  instance, "FOO+").</t>

  <t>This document uses the term "virtual interface" when describing
  how the client uses the IPv6 address(es) assigned by the gateway.
  While existing IPsec documents do not use this term, it is not a new
  concept.  In order to use the address assigned by the VPN gateway,
  current VPN clients already create a local "virtual interface", as
  only addresses assigned to interfaces can be used, e.g., as source
  addresses for TCP connections. Note that this definition of
  "interface" is not necessarily identical with what some particular
  implementation calls "interface".</t>

</section>


<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<section title="Current Limitations and Goals" anchor="limitations">

  <t>This section describes the limitations of the current IPv6
  configuration mechanism, and requirements for the new solution.</t>

  <section title="Multiple Prefixes">

    <t>In <xref target="fig:ipv6"/> only a single IPv6 address (from a
    single prefix) is assigned. The specification does allow the
    client to include multiple INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS attributes in its
    request, but the gateway cannot assign more addresses than the
    client requested.</t>

    <t>Multiple prefixes are useful for site renumbering, host-based
    site multihoming <xref target="SHIM6"/>, and unique local IPv6
    addresses <xref target="RFC4193"/>.  In all of these cases, the
    gateway has better information on how many different addresses
    (from different prefixes) the client should be assigned.</t>
 
    <t>The solution should support assigning address from multiple
    prefixes, without requiring the client to know beforehand how many
    prefixes are needed.</t>

  </section>
   
  <section title="Link-Local Addresses">

    <t>The IPv6 addressing architecture <xref target="IPv6Addr"/>
    specifies that "IPv6 addresses of all types are assigned to
    interfaces, not nodes. [..]  All interfaces are required to have
    at least one Link-Local unicast address".</t>

    <t>Currently, the virtual interface created by IKEv2 configuration
    payloads does not have link-local addresses. This violates the
    requirements in <xref target="IPv6Addr"/> and prevents the use of
    protocols that require link-local addresses, such as <xref
    target="MLDv2"/> and <xref target="DHCPv6"/>.</t>

    <t>The solution should assign link-local addresses to the virtual
    interfaces, and allow them to be used for protocols between the
    VPN client and gateway.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Interface Identifier Selection" anchor="iidselection">
 
    <t>In the message exchange shown in <xref target="fig:ipv6"/>, the
    gateway chooses the interface ID used by the client. It is also
    possible for the client to request a specific interface ID; the
    gateway then chooses the prefix part.</t>

    <t>This approach complicates the use of Cryptographically
    Generated Addresses <xref target="CGA"/>. With CGAs, the interface
    ID cannot be calculated before the prefix is known. The client
    could first obtain a non-CGA address to determine the prefix, and
    then send a separate CFG_REQUEST to obtain a CGA address with the
    same prefix. However, this approach requires that the IKEv2
    software component provides an interface to the component managing
    CGAs; an ugly implementation dependency that would be best
    avoided.</t>

    <t>Similar concerns apply to other cases where the client has some
    interest in what interface ID is being used, such as Hash-Based
    Addresses <xref target="HBA"/> and privacy addresses <xref
    target="RFC4941"/>.</t>

    <t>Without CGAs and HBAs, VPN clients are not able to fully use
    IPv6 features such as <xref target="SHIM6"/> or enhanced Mobile
    IPv6 route optimization <xref target="RFC4866"/>.</t>

    <t>The solution should allow the VPN client to easily obtain
    several addresses from a given prefix, where the interface IDs are
    selected by the client, and may depend on the prefix.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Sharing VPN Access">

    <t>Some VPN clients may want to share the VPN connection with
    other devices (e.g., from a cell phone to a laptop, or vice versa)
    via some local area network connection (such as Wireless LAN or
    Bluetooth), if allowed by the security policy.</t>
 
    <t>Quite obviously sharing of VPN access requires more than one
    address (unless NAT is used). However, the current model where
    each address is requested separately is probably complex to
    integrate with a local area network that uses stateless address
    autoconfiguration <xref target="AUTOCONF"/>.
    Thus, obtaining a whole prefix for the VPN
    client, and advertising that to the local link (something
    resembling <xref target="NDProxy"/>) would be preferable. With
    DHCPv6 prefix delegation <xref target="RFC3633"/>, even <xref
    target="NDProxy"/> and associated multi-link subnet issues would
    be avoided.</t>

   <t>The solution should support sharing the VPN access over a local
   area network connection when the other hosts are using stateless
   address autoconfiguration.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="General Goals">

   <t><list style='symbols'>

     <t>The solution should avoid periodic messages over the VPN
     tunnel.</t>

     <t>Re-authentication works: the client can start a new IKE SA and
     continue using the same addresses as before.</t>

     <t>Compatibility with other IPsec uses: Configuring a virtual
     IPv6 link (with addresses assigned in IKEv2) should not prevent
     the same peers from using IPsec/IKEv2 for other uses (with other
     addresses). In particular, the peers may have SPD entries and PAD
     Child SA Authorization Data entries that are not related to the
     virtual link; when a CHILD_SA is created, it should be unambigous
     which entries are used.</t>

     <t>Compatibility with current IPv6 configuration: Although the
     current IPv6 mechanism is not widely implemented, new solutions
     should not preclude its use (e.g., by defining incompatible
     semantics for the existing payloads).</t>

    <t>The solution should have clean implementation dependencies. In
    particular, it should not require significant modifications to the
    core IPv6 stack (typically part of the operating system), or
    require the IKEv2 implementor to re-implement parts of the IPv6
    stack (to, e.g., have access or control to functionality that is
    currently not exposed by interfaces of the IPv6 stack).</t>

     <t>Re-use existing mechanisms as much as possible, as described in <xref
     target="IPConfig"/>.  <xref target="design rationale"/> describes the
     rationale why this document nevertheless uses IKEv2 Configuration
     Payloads for configuring the addresses.  However,
     <xref target="init-xchg"/> recommends using DHCPv6 Information-Request
     message for obtaining other configuration information (such as DNS
     server addresses).</t>

    </list></t>

  </section>

  <section title="Non-Goals">
 
  <t>Mobile IPv6 already defines how it interacts with IPsec/IKEv2
  <xref target="RFC4877"/>, and the intent of this document is not
  to change that interaction in any way.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Additional Information">

    <t>If the VPN client is assigned IPv6 address(es) from prefix(es)
    that are shared with other VPN clients, this results in some kind
    of multi-link subnet.  <xref target="Multilink"/> describes issues
    associated with multi-link subnets, and recommends that they
    should be avoided.</t>

    <t>The original 3GPP specifications for IPv6 assigned a single IPv6
    address to each mobile phone, resembling current IKEv2 payloads.
    <xref target="RFC3314"/> described the problems with this
    approach, and caused 3GPP to change the specifications to assign
    unique /64 prefix(es) for each phone.</t>

    <t>Due to similar concerns, the IEEE 802.16 IPv6 Convergence
    Sublayer <xref target="RFC5121"/> and Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref
    target="RFC5213"/> also assign unique prefixes.</t>

<section title="Solution Details" anchor="solution">

<section title="Initial Exchanges" anchor="init-xchg">

  <t>1) During IKE_AUTH, the client sends a new configuration
  attribute, INTERNAL_IP6_LINK, which requests a virtual link to be
  configured.  The attribute contains the client's interface ID for
  the link-local address (other addresses may use other interface
  IDs).  Typically, the client would also ask for DHCPv6 server
  address; this is used only for configuration (such as DNS server
  addresses), not address assignment. </t>
  
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   CP(CFG_REQUEST) =
      { INTERNAL_IP6_LINK(Client's Link-Local Interface ID)

          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)  -->
]]></artwork></figure>

  <t>If the client has sent the INTERNAL_IP6_LINK configuration attribute, the
  VPN gateway SHOULD ignore any INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS configuration attribute
  present in the request.</t>

  <t>The VPN gateway MUST choose for itself a link-local interface identifier
  different than the client's one, i.e., accept the link-local interface
  identifier proposed by the client.  In case the VPN gateway cannot accept the
  link-local interface identifier the client proposed, the VPN gateway MUST
  fail the IPv6 address assignment by including a NOTIFY payload with the
  INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE message.</t> 

  <t>The VPN Gateway then replies with an INTERNAL_IP6_LINK
  configuration attribute that contains the IKEv2 Link ID (an
  identifier selected by the VPN gateway, treated as an opaque octet
  string by the client -- this will be used for reauthentication and
  CREATE_CHILD_SA messages), the gateway's link local interface
  identier, and zero or more INTERNAL_IP6_PREFIX attributes. The
  traffic selectors proposed by the initiator are also narrowed to
  contain only the assigned prefixes, and the client link-local
  address (FE80::&lt;Client's Interface ID&gt;)identifier.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   CP(CFG_REPLY) =
      { INTERNAL_IP6_LINK(Gateway's Link-Local Interface ID,
                          IKEv2 Link ID)
        INTERNAL_IP6_PREFIX(Prefix1/64),
        [INTERNAL_IP6_PREFIX(Prefix2/64),...],
        [INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP(Address) ]
   TSi = ((0, 0-65535, 
           FE80::<Client's Interface ID> -
           FE80::<Client's Interface ID>)
          (0, 0-65535, 
           Prefix1::0 - 
           Prefix1::FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF),  
          [(0, 0-65535, 
            Prefix2::0 - 
            Prefix2::FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF), ...])
   TSr = (0, 0-65535, 
          0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 -
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)
]]></artwork></figure>

   <t>At this point, the client can configure its link-local address 
   (FE80::&lt;Client's Interface ID&gt;), and other non-link-local
   unicast addresses from the assigned prefixes (with any proper interface
   identifier <xref target="IPv6Addr"/>). The VPN gateway MUST NOT
   simultaneously assign the same prefixes to any other client, and MUST NOT
   itself configure addresses from these prefixes. Thus, the client does not
   have to perform Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). (This approach is based
   on <xref target="IPv6PPP"/>.)</t>
 
   <t>The prefixes remain valid through the lifetime of the IKE SA
   (and its continuations via rekeying). If the VPN gateway needs to
   remove a prefix it has previously assigned, or assign a new prefix,
   it can do so with reauthentication (either starting
   reauthentication itself, or requesting the client to reauthenticate
   using <xref target="RFC4478"/>).</t>

   <t>2) The client also contacts the DHCPv6 server. This is the
   RECOMMENDED way to obtain additional configuration parameters (such
   as DNS server addresses), as it allows easier extensibility and more
   options (such as the domain search list for DNS).</t>

</section>

<section title="Reauthentication" anchor="reauth">

  <t>When the client performs reauthentication (and wants to continue
  using the same "virtual link"), it includes the IKEv2 Link ID
  given by the gateway in the INTERNAL_IP6_LINK attribute.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   CP(CFG_REQUEST) =
      { INTERNAL_IP6_LINK(Client's Link Local Interface ID,
                          IKEv2 Link ID)
        INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP() }
   TSi = (0, 0-65535, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 -
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)
   TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 -
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)  -->
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>

   At this point, the gateway MUST verify that the client is indeed allowed to
   use the link identified by the IKEv2 Link ID. The same situation occurs in
   <xref target="IKEv2"/> when the client wants to continue using the same IPv4
   address with the INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS configuration attribute.  Typically,
   the gateway would use the Link ID to look up relevant local state, and
   compare the authenticated peer identity of the IKE_SA with the local state.

   </t>
   <t>

   If the client is allowed to continue using this link, the gateway
   replies (see <xref target="init-xchg"/>) with the same Gateway's Link-Local
   Interface ID and IKEv2 Link ID as used earlier, and sends the IPv6
   prefix(es) associated with this link. Usually, the IPv6 prefix(es)
   will also be the same as earlier, but this is not required.

   </t>
   <t>

   If the client is not allowed to continue using this link, the
   gateway treats it as a request for a new virtual link, selects a
   different IKEv2 Link ID value, and replies as in <xref target="init-xchg"/>.

</t>

</section>

<section title="Creating CHILD_SAs" anchor="childsas">

  <t>When a CHILD_SA is created, the peers need to determine which SPD
  entries and PAD Child SA Authorization Data entries are used for
  this CHILD_SA. In the basic client-to-VPN-gateway uses, the
  situation is simple: all the matching SPD entries and Child SA
  Authorization Data entries are related to the "virtual link" between
  the VPN client and the VPN gateway.  However, if the same peers are
  also using IPsec/IKEv2 for other uses (with addresses not assigned
  inside IKEv2), they would also have SPD entries and PAD Child SA
  Authorization Data that is not related to the virtual link.</t>

  <t>If one of the peers requests a CHILD_SA and proposes traffic
  selectors covering everything (like in <xref target="fig:ipv6"/>),
  should those be narrowed to the prefixes configured with
  INTERNAL_IP6_PREFIX, or to the other SPD/PAD entries? While some
  kind of heuristics are possible (see Appendix A for discussion),
  this document specifies an explicit solution:</t>

  <t>The peers MUST include a LINK_ID notification, containing the
  IKEv2 Link ID, in all CREATE_CHILD_SA requests (including rekeys)
  that are related to the virtual link.  The LINK_ID notification is
  not included in the CREATE_CHILD_SA response, or when doing IKE_SA
  rekeying.</t>
  
</section>

<section title="Relationship to Neighbor Discovery">
 
  <t>Neighbor Discovery <xref target="IPv6ND"/> specifies the
  following mechanisms:</t>

  <t>Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery, Parameter Discovery, and
  Address Autoconfiguration are not used, as the necessary
  functionality is implemented in IKEv2.</t>

  <t>Address Resolution, Next-hop Determination, and Redirect are not
  used, as the virtual link does not have link-layer addresses, and is
  a point-to-point link.</t>

  <t>Neighbor Unreachability Detection could be used, but is a bit
  redundant given IKEv2 Dead Peer Detection.</t>

  <t>Duplicate Address Detection is not needed, because this is a
  point-to-point link, where the VPN gateway does not assign any
  addresses from the global unicast prefixes, and link-local interface
  identifier is negotiated separately.</t>

<t>
	Duplicate Address Detection is not needed for global unicast addresses formed from the global unicast prefix(es) configured as part of the IKEv2 exchange, because this is a point-to-point link, where the VPN gateway does not assign any addresses from the global unicast prefixes. Duplicate Address Detection may be needed for link-local addresses, e.g., when the client configures a link-local address as per <xref target="RFC4941"/>.
</t>

<t>
	Thus, Duplicate Address Detection MAY be skipped for global unicast addresses formed from the global unicast prefix(es) configured as part of the IKEv2 exchange. However, Duplicate Address Detection for link-local unicast addresses MUST be performed as required per some other specifications, e.g., <xref target="RFC4941"/>.

<section title="Relationship to Existing IKEv2 Payloads" anchor="xist-plds">

  <t>The mechanism described in this document is not intended to be
  used at the same time as the existing INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS
  attribute. For compatibility with gateways implementing only
  INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS, the VPN client MAY include attributes for both
  mechanisms in CFG_REQUEST. The capabilities and preferences of the
  VPN gateway will then determine which is used.</t>

  <t>All other attributes except INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS (and
  INTENAL_ADDRESS_EXPIRY) from <xref target="IKEv2"/> remain valid,
  including the somewhat confusingly named INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET (see
  Section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC4718"/> for discussion).</t>

	<t>

		The mechanism described in this document assigns each client a
		unique prefix, which makes using randomized interface
		identifiers <xref target="RFC4941"/> ineffective from privacy
		point of view: the client is still uniquely identified by the
		prefix. In some environments, it may be preferable to assign a
		VPN client the same prefix each time a VPN connection is

<section title="Design Rationale (Non-Normative)" anchor="design rationale">

  <t>This appendix describes some of the reasons why the solution in
  <xref target="solution"/> was selected, and lists some alternative
  designs that were considered, but ultimately rejected.</t>

  <t>Assigning a new IPv6 address to the client creates a new "virtual
  IPv6 interface", and "virtual link" between the client and the
  gateway. We will assume that the virtual link has the following
  properties:

  <list style="symbols"> 
  
   <t>The link and its interfaces are created and destroyed by the IKEv2
   process.</t>

   <t>The link is not an IPsec SA; at any time, there can be zero or
   more IPsec SAs covering traffic on this link.</t>

   <t>The link is not a single IKE SA; to support reauthentication, it
   must be possible to identify the same link in another IKE SA.</t>
  
   <t>Not all IPsec-protected traffic between the peers is necessarily
   related to the virtual link (although in the simplest VPN
   client-to-gateway scenario it will be).</t>
 
  </list></t>

  <t>Given these assumptions and the goals described in <xref
  target="limitations"/>, it seems that the most important design
  choices to be made are the following:</t>

  <t><list style='symbols'>

    <t>What link/subnet model is used: in other words, the
    relationships between VPN clients, IPv6 subnet prefixes, and
    link-local traffic (especially link-local multicast).</t>

    <t>How information about the IPv6 prefix(es) is distributed from
    the gateway to the clients.</t>

    <t>How to ensure unique IPv6 addresses for each client, and keep
    forwarding state up-to-date accordingly.</t>

    <t>How layer 3 access control is done; in other words, where the
    mechanisms for preventing address spoofing by clients are placed
    architecturally.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>Each of these is discussed next in turn.</t>

<section title="Link Model">

  <t>There are at least three main choices how to organize the 
  relationships between VPN clients, IPv6 subnet prefixes, 
  and link-local traffic:</t>

  <t><list style='symbols'>

    <t>Point-to-point link model: each VPN client is assigned one or
    more IPv6 prefixes; these prefixes are not shared with other
    clients, and there is no link-local traffic between different VPN
    clients connected to the same gateway.</t>

    <t>Multi-access link model: multiple VPN clients share the same
    IPv6 prefix.  Link-local multicast packets sent by one VPN client
    will be received by other VPN clients (VPN gateway will forward
    the packets, possibly with MLD snooping to remove unnecessary
    packets).</t>

    <t>"Router aggregation" link model: one form of "multi-link" subnet
    <xref target="Multilink"/> where multiple VPN clients share the
    same IPv6 prefix. Link-local multicast will not be received by
    other VPN clients.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>In the multi-access link model, VPN clients who are idle (i.e.,
  not currently sending or receiving application traffic) could
  receive significant amounts of multicast packets from other clients
  (depending on how many other clients are connected). This is
  especially undesirable when the clients are battery-powered; for
  example, a PDA which keeps the VPN connection to corporate intranet
  active 24/7. For this reason, using the multi-access link model was
  rejected.</t>

  <t>The configuration attributes specified in <xref
  target="solution"/> use the point-to-point link model.</t>

</section>

<section title="Distributing Prefix Information">

  <t>Some types of addresses, such as CGAs, require knowledge about
  the prefix before an address can be generated. The prefix
  information could be distributed to clients in the following
  ways:</t>

  <t><list style='symbols'>

    <t>IKEv2 messages (Configuration Payloads).</t>

    <t>Router Advertisement messages (sent over the IPsec tunnel).</t>
   
    <t>DHCPv6 messages (sent over the IPsec tunnel).</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>In <xref target="solution"/>, the prefix information is
  distributed in IKEv2 messages.</t>

</section>

<section title="Unique Address Allocation">

  <t>In the "multi-access" and "router aggregation" link models (where
  a single IPv6 prefix is shared between multiple VPN clients)
  mechanisms are needed to ensure that one VPN client does not use an
  address already used by some other client. Also, the VPN gateway has
  to know which client is using which addresses in order to correctly
  forward traffic.</t>

  <t>The main choices seem to be the following:</t>

  <t><list style='symbols'>

    <t>Clients receive the address(es) they are allowed to use
    in IKEv2 messages (Configuration Payloads). In this case,
    keeping track of which client is using which address is trivial.</t>

    <t>Clients receive the address(es) they are allowed to use in
    DHCPv6 messages sent over the IPsec tunnel. In case the DHCPv6
    server is not integrated with the VPN gateway, the gateway may
    need to work as a relay agent to keep track of which client is
    using which address (and update its forwarding state
    accordingly).</t>

    <t>Clients can use stateless address autoconfiguration to
    configure addresses and perform Duplicate Address Detection
    (DAD). This is easy to do in multi-access link model, and can be
    made to work with router aggregation link model if the VPN gateway
    traps Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages and spoofs Neighbor
    Advertisement (NA) replies.  The gateway keeps track of which client is
    using which address (and updates its forwarding state accordingly)
    by trapping these NS/NA messages.</t>

  </list></t>
  
  <t>In the point-to-point link model, the client can simply use any
  address from the prefix, and the VPN gateway only needs to know
  which client is using which prefix in order to forward packets
  correctly.</t>

</section>

<section title="Layer 3 Access Control">

  <t>It is almost always desirable to prevent one VPN client from
  sending packets with a source address that is used by another VPN
  client. In order to correctly forward packets destined to clients,
  the VPN gateway obviously has to know which client is using which
  address; the question is therefore where, architecturally, the
  mechanisms for ingress filtering are placed.</t>

  <t><list style='symbols'>

    <t>Layer 3 access control enforced by IPsec SAD/SPD: the
    addresses/prefixes assigned to a VPN client are reflected in the
    traffic selectors used in IPsec Security Association and Security
    Policy Database entries, as negotiated in IKEv2.</t>

    <t>The ingress filtering capability could be placed outside IPsec; 
    the traffic selectors in SAD/SPD entries would cover traffic
    that would be dropped later by ingress filtering.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>The former approach is used by the current IPv4 solution, 
  and the mechanism specified in <xref target="solution"/>.</t>
  
</section>


<section title="Other Considerations">

  <t><list style="hanging">

  <t hangText="VPN gateway state">
   <vspace blankLines="1"/> In some combinations of design choices,
   the amount of state information required in the VPN gateway depends
   not only on the number of clients, but also on the number of addresses
   used by one client. With privacy addresses and potentially some uses 
   of Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs), a single client
   could have a large number of different addresses (especially if 
   different privacy addresses are used with different destinations).</t>

  <t hangText="Virtual link identifier">
   <vspace blankLines="1"/> Reauthentication requires a way to
   uniquely identify the virtual link when a second IKE SA is
   created. Some possible alternatives are the IKE SPIs of the IKE SA
   where the virtual link was "created" (assuming we can't have
   multiple virtual links within the same IKE SA), a new identifier
   assigned when the link is created, or any unique prefix or address
   that remains assigned to the link for its entire lifetime. 
   <xref target="solution"/> specifies that the gateway assigns a new
   IKEv2 Link ID when the link is created. The client treats the
   Link ID as an opaque octet string; the gateway uses it to
   identify relevant local state when reauthentication is done.

   <vspace blankLines="1"/> Note that the link is not uniquely
   identified by the IKE peer identities (because IDi is often a user
   identity that can be used on multiple hosts at the same time), or
   the outer IP addresses of the peers (due to NAT Traversal and
   <xref target="MOBIKE"/>).</t>

  <t hangText='Prefix lifetime'>
  <vspace blankLines="1"/> Prefixes could remain valid either for the
  lifetime of the IKE SA, until explicitly cancelled, or for an
  explicitly specified time.  In <xref target="solution"/> the
  prefixes remain valid for the lifetime of the IKE SA (and its
  continuations via rekeying, but not reauthentication).  If
  necessary, the VPN gateway can thus add or remove prefixes by
  triggering reauthentication. It is assumed that adding or removing
  prefixes is a relatively rare situation, and thus this document does
  not specify more complex solutions (such as explicit prefix
  lifetimes, or use of CFG_SET/CFG_ACK).</t>

  <t hangText='Compatibility with other IPsec uses'>
  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
  Compatibility with other IPsec uses probably requires that when a
  CHILD_SA is created, both peers can determine whether the CHILD_SA
  applies to the virtual interface (at the end of the virtual link),
  or the real interfaces IKEv2 messages are being sent over.
  This is required to select the correct SPD to be used for
  traffic selector narrowing and SA authorization in general.

  <vspace blankLines="1"/> One straight-forward solution is to add an
  extra payload to CREATE_CHILD_SA requests, containing the virtual
  link identifier. Requests not containing this payload would refer to
  the real link (over which IKEv2 messages are being sent).

  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
  Another solution is to require that the peer requesting
  a CHILD_SA proposes traffic selectors that identify the link.
  For example, if TSi includes the peer's "outer" IP address, it's
  probably related to the real interface, not the virtual one.
  Or if TSi includes any of the prefixes assigned by the gateway
  (or the link-local or multicast prefix), it is probably related
  to the virtual interface.

  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
  These heuristics can work in many
  situations, but have proved inadequate in the context of
  IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels <xref target="RFC4891"/> and Provider
  Provisioned VPNs <xref target="VLINK"/> <xref target="RFC3884"/>,
  and Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC4877"/>. Thus, <xref
  target="solution"/> includes the virtual link identifier
  in all CREATE_CHILD_SA requests that apply to the virtual
  interface.</t>

  <t hangText='Example about other IPsec uses:'>

  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
  If a VPN gateway receives a CREATE_CHILD_SA request
  associated with a physical Ethernet interface, requesting SA for
  (TSi=FE80::something, dst=*), it would typically reject the request
  (or in other words, narrow it to an empty set) because it doesn't
  have SPD/PAD entries that would allow joe.user@example.com to
  request such CHILD_SAs.

  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
  (However, it might have SPD/PAD entries that would allow
  "neighboring-router.example.com" to create such SAs, for protecting
  e.g. some routing protocol that uses link-local addresses.)

  <vspace blankLines="1"/>
  However, the virtual interface created when joe.user@example.com
  authenticated and sent INTERNAL_IP6_LINK would have a different
  SPD/PAD, which would allow joe.user@example.com to create this
  SA.</t>

<section title="Alternative Solution Sketches" anchor="alt-sol">

<section title="Version -00 Sketch">

  <t>The -00 version of this draft contained the following solution
  sketch, which is basically a combination of (1) point-to-point link
  model, (2) prefix information distributed in Neighbor
  Advertisements, and (3) access control enforced outside IPsec.</t>

  <t>1) During IKE_AUTH, client sends a new configuration attribute,
  INTERNAL_IP6_LINK, which requests a virtual link to be created.  The
  attribute contains the client's interface ID for link-local address
  (other addresses may use other interface IDs).</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   CP(CFG_REQUEST) = 
      { INTERNAL_IP6_LINK(Link-Local Interface ID) }

          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)
   TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 - 
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)  -->
]]></artwork></figure>

  <t>The VPN gateway replies with its own link-local interface ID
  (which has to be different from the client's) and an IKEv2 Link ID
  (which will be used for reauthentication).</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   CP(CFG_REPLY) = 
     { INTERNAL_IP6_LINK(Link-Local Interface ID, IKEv2 Link ID) }
   TSi = (0, 0-65535, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 - 
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)
   TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 - 
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF) 
]]></artwork></figure>

  <t>At this point, both peers configure the virtual interface with
  the link-local addresses.</t>

  <t>2) The next step is IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration;
  that is, Router Solicitation and Router Advertisement messages sent
  over the IPsec SA.  </t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   ESP(Router Solicitation:
       src=::,
       dst=FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2)  -->

   <-- ESP(Router Advertisement: 
           src=FE80::<Gateway's Interface ID>
           dst=FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1, 
           Prefix1, [Prefix2...])
]]></artwork></figure>

  <t>After receiving the Router Advertisement, the client can
  configure unicast addresses from the advertised prefixes, using any
  proper interface ID. The VPN gateway does not simultaneously assign the
  same prefixes to any other client, and does not itself configure
  addresses from these prefixes. Thus, the client does not have to
  perform Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).</t>

  <t>3) Reauthentication works basically the same way as in
  <xref target="solution"/>; the client includes the IKEv2 Link ID
  in the INTERNAL_IP6_LINK attribute.</t>

  <t>4) Creating and rekeying IPsec SAs works basically the same way
  as in <xref target="childsas"/>; the client includes the IKEv2 Link
  ID in those CHILD_SA requests that are related to the virtual
  link.</t>

  <t>Comments: This was changed in -01 draft based on feedback from
  VPN vendors: while the solution looks nice on paper, it is claimed
  to be unneccessarily complex to implement when the IKE
  implementation and IPv6 stack are from different
  companies. Furthermore, enforcing access control outside IPsec is a
  significant architectural change compared to current IPv4
  solutions.</t>

</section>

<section title="Router Aggregation Sketch #1">

  <t>The following solution was sketched during the IETF 70 meeting in
  Vancouver together with Hemant Singh.  It combines the (1) router
  aggregation link model, (2) prefix information distributed in IKEv2

  autoconfiguration (with VPN gateway trapping NS messages and
  spoofing NA replies), and (4) access control enforced (partly)
  outside IPsec.</t>

  the assigned prefixes (and the link-local prefix).</t>

  <t>2) The client now configures tentative unicast addresses from the
  prefixes given by the gateway, and performs Duplicate Address
  Detection (DAD) for them.</t>
 
  <t>The Neighbor Solicitation messages are processed by the VPN
  gateway: if the target address is already in use by some other VPN
  client, the gateway replies with a Neighbor Advertisement. If the
  target address is not already in use, the VPN gateway notes that it
  is now being used by this client, and updates its forwarding state
  accordingly.</t>

  <t>Comments: The main disadvantages of this solution are
  non-standard processing of NS messages (which are used to update the
  gateway's forwarding state), and performing access control partly
  outside IPsec.</t>

  <t>Comments: The main advantage of this solution is that it's quite
  close to the current IPv4 way of doing things. By adding explicit
  link creation (with Link ID for reauthentication/SPD selection, and
  link-local addresses), and slightly changing the semantics (and also
  name) of INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS attribute (can return more attributes
  than was asked), we get much of the needed functionality.</t>

  <t>The biggest disadvantages are probably potentially complex
  implementation dependency for interface ID selection (see <xref

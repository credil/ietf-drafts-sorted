            <t>JSON Patch defines a JSON document structure for expressing
              a sequence of operations to apply to a JavaScript Object
              Notation (JSON) document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH
              method. The "application/json-patch" media type is used to 
              identify such patch documents.

            is a common format for the exchange and storage of structured

            <t>JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type

            <t>This format is also potentially useful in other cases where
            necessary to make partial updates to a JSON document, or to a data
            structure that has similar constraints (i.e., they can be
            serialised as an object or an array using the JSON grammar).</t>

            <t>A JSON Patch document is a <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref>
            document that represents an array of objects. Each object
            represents a single operation to be applied to the target JSON
            document.</t>

]]>         </artwork></figure>

            <t>Evaluation of a JSON Patch document begins against a target
            JSON document. Operations are applied sequentially in the order
            they appear in the array. Each operation in the sequence is
            applied to the target document; the resulting document becomes the
            target of the next operation. Evaluation continues until all
            operations are successfully applied, or an error condition is
            encountered.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Operations">

            <t>Operation objects MUST have exactly one "op" member, whose
            value indicates the operation to perform. Its value MUST be one of
            "add", "remove", "replace", "move", "copy" or "test"; other values
            are errors. The semantics of each is defined below.</t>
                
            <t>Additionally, operation objects MUST have exactly one "path"
            member. That member's value is a string containing a <xref
            target="JSON-Pointer"/> value that references a location within
            the target document (the "target location") where the
            operation is performed.</t>

            <t>The meanings of other members of operation objects are defined
            by operation (see the subsections below). Members that are not
            explicitly defined for the operation in question MUST be ignored
            (i.e., the operation will complete as if the undefined member did
            not appear in the object).</t>

            <t>Note that the ordering of members in JSON objects is not
            significant; therefore, the following operation objects are 
            equivalent:</t>
            
            <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{ "op": "add", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": "foo" }
{ "path": "/a/b/c", "op": "add", "value": "foo" }
{ "value": "foo", "path": "/a/b/c", "op": "add" }
]]>         </artwork></figure>
            
            <t>Operations are applied to the data structures represented by a
            JSON document; i.e., after any unescaping (see <xref
            target="RFC4627"/>, Section 2.5) takes place.</t>
            
            <section title="add">
                <t>The "add" operation performs the following function,
                depending upon what the target location references:
                
                <list style="symbols">

                  <t>If the target location specifies an array index, a new
                  value is inserted into the array at the specified index.</t>
                  
                  <t>If the target location specifies an object member that
                  does not already exist, a new member is added to the
                  object.</t>
                  
                  <t>If the target location specifies an object member that
                  does exist, that member's value is replaced.</t>
                  
                </list></t>
                
                <t>The operation object MUST contain a "value" member whose
                  content specifies the value to be added.</t>
                
                <figure><preamble>For example:</preamble><artwork><![CDATA[
{ "op": "add", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": [ "foo", "bar" ] }
]]>             </artwork></figure>
                
                <t>When the operation is applied, the target location MUST
                reference one of:

                <list style="symbols">

                    <t>The root of the target document - whereupon the
                    specified value becomes the entire content of the target
                    document.</t>

                    <t>A member to add to an existing object - whereupon the
                    supplied value is added to that object at the indicated
                    location. If the member already exists, it is replaced
                    by the specified value.</t>

                    <t>An element to add to an existing array - whereupon the
                    supplied value is added to the array at the indicated
                    location. Any elements at or above the specified index are
                    shifted one position to the right. The specified index
                    MUST NOT be greater than the number of elements in the
                    array. If the "-" character is used to index the end of
                    the array (see <xref target="JSON-Pointer"/>), this has
                    the effect of appending the value to the array.</t>

                </list></t>
                
                <t>Because this operation is designed to add to existing
                objects and arrays, its target location will often not exist.
                Although the pointer's error handling algorithm will thus be
                invoked, this specification defines the error handling
                behaviour for "add" pointers to ignore that error and add
                the value as specified.</t>

                <t>However, the object itself or an array containing it does
                need to exist, and it remains an error for that not to be the
                case. For example, an "add" with a target location of "/a/b"
                starting with this document:</t>

                <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{ "a": { "foo": 1 } }
]]>             </artwork></figure>                   
                   
                <t>is not an error, because "a" exists, and "b" will be added
                to its value. It is an error in this document:</t>

                <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{ "q": { "bar": 2 } }

            </section>

            <section title="remove">
                <t>The "remove" operation removes the value at the target
                location.</t>

                <t>The target location MUST exist for the operation to be
                successful.</t>

                <t>If removing an element from an array, any elements above

                <t>The "replace" operation replaces the value at the target
                location with a new value. The operation object MUST contain a

                value.</t>

                <t>The target location MUST exist for the operation to be

                <t>The "from" location MUST NOT be a proper prefix of the

            <t>This specification has the same security considerations as
            <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref> and <xref
            target="JSON-Pointer"/>.</t>
            
            <t>A few older Web browsers can be coerced into loading an
            arbitrary JSON document whose root is an array, leading to a
            situation where a JSON Patch document containing sensitive
            information could be exposed to attackers, even if access is
            authenticated. This is known as a Cross-Site Request Forgery
            (CSRF) attack <xref target="CSRF"/>.</t>
            
            <t>However, such browsers are not widely used ( estimated to
            comprise less than 1% of the market, at the time of writing).
            Publishers who are nevertheless concerned about this attack are
            advised to avoid making such documents available with HTTP
            GET.</t>

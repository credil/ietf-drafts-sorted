Abstract

   [RFC4762] describes a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses
   that have been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster
   convergence on topology change. The procedure also removes MAC
   addresses in the VPLS that do not require relearning due to such
   topology change.

   This document defines an enhancement to the MAC Address Withdrawal
   procedure with empty MAC List [RFC4762], which enables a Provider
   Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses that need to be
   relearned.

   Additional extensions to [RFC4762] MAC Withdrawal procedures are
   specified to provide optimized MAC flushing for the PBB-VPLS
   specified in [PBB-VPLS Model].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [PBB-VPLS Model],
   [RFC5036], [RFC4447] and [RFC4762]. Throughout this document VPLS
   means the emulated bridged LAN service offered to a customer. H-VPLS
   means the hierarchical connectivity or layout of MTU-s and PE devices
   offering the VPLS [RFC4762]. The terms spoke node and MTU-s in H-VPLS
   are used interchangeably.



2. Introduction

   A method of Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also known as
   Transparent LAN Service (TLS) is described in [RFC4762]. A VPLS is
   created using a collection of one or more point-to-point pseudowires
   (PWs) [RFC4664] configured in a flat, full-mesh topology. The mesh
   topology provides a LAN segment or broadcast domain that is fully
   capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses at the
   PE devices.

   This VPLS full mesh core configuration can be augmented with
   additional non-meshed spoke nodes to provide a Hierarchical VPLS (H-
   VPLS) service [RFC4762].

   [PBB-VPLS Model] describes how Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can
   be integrated with VPLS to allow for useful PBB capabilities while
   continuing to avoid the use of MSTP in the backbone. The combined
   solution referred to as PBB-VPLS results in better scalability in
   terms of number of service instances, PWs and C-MACs that need to be
   handled in the VPLS PEs.

   A MAC Address Withdrawal mechanism for VPLS is described in [RFC4762]
   to remove or unlearn MAC addresses for faster convergence on topology
   change in resilient H-VPLS topologies.

Internet-Draft    Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS   October 25, 2010


   An example of usage of the MAC Flush mechanism is the dual-homed
   H-VPLS where an edge device termed as MTU-s is connected to two PE
   devices via primary spoke PW and backup spoke PW respectively. Such
   redundancy is designed to protect against the failure of primary
   spoke PW or primary PE device. When the MTU-s switches over to the
   backup PW, it is required to flush the MAC addresses learned in the
   corresponding VSI in peer PE devices participating in full mesh, to
   avoid black holing of frames to those addresses. Note that forced
   switchover to backup PW can be also performed at MTU-s
   administratively due to maintenance activities on the primary spoke
   PW. When the backup PW is made active by the MTU-s, it triggers LDP
   Address Withdraw Message with a list of MAC addresses to be flushed.
   The message is forwarded over the LDP session(s) associated with the
   newly activated PW. In order to minimize the impact on LDP
   convergence time and scalability when a MAC List TLV contains a large
   number of MAC addresses, many implementations use a LDP Address
   Withdraw Message with an empty MAC List. Throughout this document the
   term MAC Flush Message is used to specify LDP Address Withdraw
   Message with empty MAC List described in [RFC4762] unless specified
   otherwise.

   As per the MAC Address Withdrawal processing rules in [RFC4762] a PE
   device on receiving a MAC flush message removes all MAC addresses
   associated with the specified VPLS instance (as indicated in the FEC
   TLV) except the MAC addresses learned over the newly activated PW.
   The PE device further triggers a MAC flush message to each remote PE
   device connected to it in the VPLS full mesh.

   This method of MAC flushing is modeled after Topology Change
   Notification (TCN) in Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)[802.1w].
   When a bridge switches from a failed link to the backup link, the
   bridge sends out a TCN message over the newly activated link. The
   upstream bridge upon receiving this message flushes its entire MAC
   addresses except the ones received over this link and sends the TCN
   message out of its other ports in that spanning tree instance. The
   message is further relayed along the spanning tree by the other
   bridges. When a PE device in the full-mesh of H-VPLS receives a MAC
   flush message it also flushes MAC addresses which are not affected
   due to topology change, thus leading to unnecessary flooding and
   relearning. This document describes the problem and a solution to
   optimize the MAC flush procedure in [RFC4762] so it flushes only the
   set of MAC addresses that require relearning when topology changes in
   H-VPLS. The solution proposed in this document is generic and is
   applicable when MS-PWs are used in interconnecting PE devices in
   H-VPLS.

   [PBB-VPLS Model] describes how PBB can be integrated with VPLS to
   allow for useful PBB capabilities while continuing to avoid the use
   of MSTP in the backbone. The combined solution referred as PBB-VPLS
   results in better scalability in terms of number of service
   instances, PWs and C-MACs that need to be handled in the VPLS PEs.

   This document describes also extensions to LDP MAC Flush procedures
   described in [RFC4762] required to build desirable capabilities to
   PBB-VPLS solution.

   Section 3 covers the problem space. Section 4 describes the solution
   and the required TLV extensions.

           Figure 1: Dual homed MTU-s in two tier hierarchy H-VPLS

   In Figure 1, the MTU-s is dual-homed to PE-1 and PE-2. Only the
   primary spoke PW is active at MTU-s, thus PE-1 is acting as the
   active device to reach the full mesh in the VPLS instance. The MAC
   addresses of nodes located at access sites (behind CE1 and CE2) are
   learned at PE-1 over the primary spoke PW. PE-2, PE-3 and PE-4 learn
   those MAC addresses on their respective mesh PWs terminating to PE-1.
   When MTU-s switches to the backup spoke PW and activates it, PE-2
   becomes the active device to reach the full mesh core. Traffic
   entering the H-VPLS from CE-1 and CE-2 is diverted by the MTU-s to
   the backup spoke PW. For faster convergence MTU-s may desire to
   unlearn or remove the MAC addresses that have been learned in the
   upstream VPLS full-mesh through PE-1. MTU-s may send a MAC flush
   message to PE-2 once the backup PW has been made active. As per the
   processing rules defined in [RFC4762], PE-2 flushes the MAC addresses
   learned in the VPLS from the PWs terminating at PE-1, PE-3 and PE-4.

   In the H-VPLS core, PE devices are connected in full mesh unlike the
   spanning tree connectivity in bridges. So the MAC addresses that
   require flushing and relearning at PE-2 are only the MAC addresses
   those have been learned on the PW connected to PE-1.

   PE-2 further relays MAC flush messages to all other PE devices in the
   full mesh. Same processing rule applies at all those PE devices. For
   example, at PE-3 all of the MAC addresses learned from the PWs
   connected to PE-1 and PE-4 are flushed and relearned subsequently. As
   the number of PE devices in the full-mesh increases, the number of
   unaffected MAC addresses flushed in a VPLS instance also increases,
   thus leading to unnecessary flooding and relearning. With large
   number of VPLS instances provisioned in the H-VPLS network topology
   the amount of unnecessary flooding and relearning increases.

3.2. Black holing issue in PBB-VPLS

   In PBB-VPLS solution a B-component VPLS (B-VPLS) may be used as
   infrastructure for one or more I-component instances. B-VPLS control
   plane (LDP Signaling) replaces I-component control plane throughout
   the MPLS core. This is raising an additional challenge related to
   black hole avoidance in the I-component domain as described in this
   section. Figure 2 describes the case of a CE device (node A) dual-
   homed to two I-component instances located on two PBB-VPLS PEs (PE1
   and PE2).

        Figure 2: PBB Black holing Issue - CE Dual-Homing use case


   The link between PE1 and CE A is active (marked with A) while the
   link between CE A and PE2 is in Standby/Blocked status. In the
   network diagram CMAC X is one of the MAC addresses located behind CE
   A in the customer domain, CMAC Y is behind CE B and the BVPLS
   instances on PE1 are associated with backbone MAC (BMAC) B1 and PE2
   with BMAC B2.

   As the packets flow from CMAC X to CMAC Y through PE1 of BMAC B1, the
   remote PEs participating in the IVPLS (for example, PE3) will learn
   the CMAC X associated with BMAC B1 on PE1. Under failure of the link
   between CE A and PE1 and activation of link to PE2, the remote PEs
   (for example, PE3) will black-hole the traffic destined for customer
   MAC X to BMAC B1 until the aging timer expires or a packet flows from
   X to Y through the PE B2. This may take a long time (default aging
   timer is 5 minutes) and may affect a large number of flows across
   multiple I-components.

   A possible solution to this issue is to use the existing LDP MAC
   Flush as specified in [RFC4762] to flush in the BVPLS domain the BMAC

   associated with the PE where the failure occurred. This will
   automatically flush the CMAC to BMAC association in the remote PEs.
   This solution though has the disadvantage of producing a lot of
   unnecessary MAC flush in the B-VPLS domain as there was no failure or
   topology change affecting the Backbone domain.

   A better solution is required to propagate the I-component events
   through the backbone infrastructure (B-VPLS) in order to flush only
   the customer MAC to BMAC entries in the remote PBB-VPLS PEs. As there
   are no IVPLS control plane exchanges across the PBB backbone,
   extensions to B-VPLS control plane are required to propagate the I-
   component MAC Flush events across the B-VPLS.

4. Solution description

4.1. MAC Flush Optimization for regular H-VPLS

   The basic principle of the optimized MAC flush mechanism is explained
   with reference to Figure 1. On switching over to the backup spoke PW
   when MTU-s triggers MAC flush message to PE-2, it also communicates
   the unique PW endpoint identifier (PE-ID) in PE-1, the formerly
   active PE device. In VPLS a PW terminates on a Virtual Switching
   Instance (VSI) in a PE device. The PE-ID is relayed in all the
   subsequent MAC flush messages triggered by PE-2 to its peer PE
   devices in the full mesh. Each PE device that receives the message
   identifies the VPLS (From FEC TLV) and its respective PW that
   terminates in PE-1 (from PE-ID). Thus the PE device flushes only the
   MAC addresses learned from that PW connected to PE-1.

   This section defines a PW Endpoint Identifier (PE-ID) TLV for LDP
   [RFC5036]. The PE-ID TLV carries the unique identifier of a generic
   PW endpoint.

  4.1.1. PE-ID TLV Format

   The encoding of PE-ID TLV follows standard LDP TLV encoding in
   [RFC5036]. A PE-ID TLV contains a list of one or more PE-ID Elements.
   Its encoding is:

   F (Forward) MUST be set to 0. Since the LDP mechanism used here is
   targeted, the TLV is not forwarded if it is not understood by the
   receiving device.

   The Type field MUST be set to 0x405 (subject to IANA approval). This

   PE-ID Element 1 to PE-ID Element n: there are several types of PE-ID
   Elements. The PE-ID Element Encoding depends on the type of the PE-ID
   Element. A PE-ID Element uniquely identifies a PW Endpoint.

   A PE-ID Element value is encoded as 1 octet field that specifies the

   The type of PE-ID Element depends on the type of FEC Element used to
   provision the respective PW. [RFC4447] defines two types of FEC
   elements that may be used for provisioning PWs - Pwid FEC (type 128)
   and the Generalized ID (GID) FEC (type 129). The Pwid FEC element
   includes a fixed-length 32 bit value called the PWid. The same PWid
   value must be configured on the local and remote PE prior to PW
   setup. The GID FEC element includes TLV fields for attachment
   individual identifiers (AII) that, in conjunction with an attachment
   group identifier (AGI), serve as PW endpoint identifiers. The
   endpoint identifier on the local PE (denoted as <AGI, source AII or
   SAII>) is called the source attachment identifier (SAI) and the
   endpoint identifier on the remote PE (denoted as <AGI, target AII or
   TAII>) is called the target attachment identifier (TAI). The SAI and
   TAI can be distinct values. This is useful for provisioning models
   where the local PE (with a particular SAI) does not know and must
   somehow learn (e.g. via MP-BGP auto-discovery) of remote TAI values
   prior to launching PW setup messages towards the remote PE.

   FEC-128 specific PE-ID Element

   This sub-type is to be used to identify a PW endpoint only if Pwid
   FEC Element is used for signaling the PW. The encoding of this PE-ID
   element is as follows:


     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     0x01      |    Length     |           PW type             |

     signaling Session by a PW endpoint.

   FEC Element is used for signaling the PW. The encoding of this PE-ID
   element is as follows:

  4.1.2. Application of PE-ID TLV in Optimized MAC Flush

   For optimized MAC flush, the PE-ID TLV MAY be sent as an OPTIONAL
   parameter in existing LDP Address Withdraw Message with empty MAC
   List. The PE-ID TLV carries the unique PW endpoint identifier in a
   VPLS as described in section 4.

   It is to note that for optimized MAC flush the PE-ID TLV carries
   sufficient information for identifying the VPLS instance and the
   unique VSI Identifier. For backward compatibility with MAC flush
   procedures in [RFC4762] both FEC TLV and PE-ID TLV should be sent in
   the MAC flush message. However the inclusion of the FEC-TLV should be
   based on what would be the desired effect should the PE-ID not be
   understood by the receiver.  In cases where the desired action when
   the PE-ID is not understood would be to behave as described in
   [RFC4762], then the FEC TLV SHOULD be always included.  In cases
   where the desired action when the PE-ID is not understood is no mac
   flushing, then the FEC TLV SHOULD NOT be included. The PE-ID TLV
   SHOULD carry the unique VSI identifier in the VPLS instance
   (specified in the FEC TLV). The PE-ID TLV SHOULD be placed after the
   existing TLVs in MAC Flush message in [RFC4762].

  4.1.3.  PE-ID TLV Processing Rules

   This section describes the processing rules of PE-ID TLV that SHOULD
   be followed in the context of MAC flush procedures in an H-VPLS.

   When an MTU-s triggers MAC flush after activation of backup spoke PW,
   it MAY send the PE-ID TLV that identifies VSI in the formerly active



Dutta, et. al           Expires April 25, 2010                [Page 11]

   PE device. There may be cases where a PE device in full mesh
   initiates MAC flush towards the core when it detects a spoke PW
   failure. In such a case the PE-ID TLV in MAC flush message MAY
   identify its own VSI. Irrespective of whether it is the MTU-s or PE
   device that initiates the MAC flush, a PE device receiving the PE-ID
   TLV SHOULD follow the same processing rules as described in this
   section.

   Note that if MS-PW is used in VPLS then a MAC flush message is
   processed only at the T-PE nodes since S-PE(s) traversed by the MS-PW
   propagate MAC flush messages without any action. In this section, a
   PE device signifies only T-PE in MS-PW case unless specified
   otherwise.

   When a PE device receives a MAC flush with PE-ID TLV, it SHOULD flush
   all the MAC addresses learned from the PW that terminates in the
   remote VSI identified by the PE-ID element.

   If a PE-ID element received in the MAC flush message identifies the
   local VSI, it SHOULD flush the MAC addresses learned from its local
   spoke PW(s) in the VPLS instance.

   If a PE device receives a MAC flush with the PE-ID TLV option and a
   valid MAC address list, it SHOULD ignore the option and deal with MAC
   addresses explicitly as per [RFC4762].

   If a PE device that doesn't support PE-ID TLV receives a MAC flush
   message with this option, it MUST ignore the option and follow the
   processing rules as per [RFC4762].

  4.1.4. Optimized MAC Flush Procedures

   This section explains the optimized MAC flush procedure in the
   scenario in Figure 1. When the backup PW is activated by MTU-s, it
   may send MAC flush message to PE-2 with the FEC TLV and the optional
   PE-ID TLV. The PE-ID element carries the VSI identifier in PE-1 for
   the VPLS. Upon receipt of the MAC flush message, PE-2 identifies the
   VPLS instance that requires MAC flush from the FEC element in the FEC
   TLV. From the PE-ID TLV, PE-2 identifies the PW in the VPLS that
   terminates in PE-1. PE-2 removes all MAC addresses learned from that
   PW. PE-2 relays MAC flush messages with the received PE-ID to all its
   peer PE devices. When the message is received at PE-3, it identifies
   the PW that terminates in the remote VSI in PE-1. PE-3 removes all
   MAC addresses learned on the PW that terminated in PE1. There may be
   redundancy scenerios where a PE device in the full mesh may be
   required to initiate optimized MAC Address Withdrawal. Figure 3 shows
   a redundant H-VPLS topology to protect against failure of MTU-s

   device. Provider RSTP may be used as selection algorithm for active
   and backup PWs in order to maintain the connectivity between MTU
   devices and PE devices at the edge. It is assumed that PE devices can
   detect failure on PWs in either direction through OAM mechanisms such
   as VCCV procedures for instance.

   MTU-1, MTU-2, PE-1 and PE-2 participate in provider RSTP. By
   configuration in RSTP it is ensured that the PW between MTU-1 and PE-
   1 is active and the PW between MTU-2 and PE-2 is blocked (made
   backup) at MTU-2 end. When the active PW failure is detected by RSTP,
   it activates the PW between MTU-2 and PE-2. When PE-1 detects the
   failing PW to MTU-1, it may trigger MAC flush into the full mesh
   with PE-ID TLV that carries its own VSI identifier in the VPLS. Other
   PE devices in the full mesh that receive the MAC flush message
   identify their respective PWs terminating on PE-1 and flush all the
   MAC addresses learned from it.

   By default, MTU-2 should still trigger MAC flush as currently defined
   in [RFC4762] after the backup PW is made active by RSTP. Mechanisms
   to prevent two copies of MAC withdraws to be sent in such scenarios
   is out of scope of this document.

   [RFC4762] describes multi-domain VPLS service where fully meshed VPLS
   networks (domains) are connected together by a single spoke PW per
   VPLS service between the VPLS "border" PE devices. To provide
   redundancy against failure of the inter-domain spoke, full mesh of
   inter-domain spokes can be setup between border PE devices and
   provider RSTP may be used for selection of the active inter-domain
   spoke. In case of inter-domain spoke PW failure, PE initiated MAC
   withdrawal may be used for optimized MAC flushing within individual
   domains.

4.2. LDP MAC Withdraw Extensions for PBB-VPLS

   The use of Address Withdraw message with MAC List TLV is proposed in
   [RFC4762] as a way to expedite removal of MAC addresses as the result
   of a topology change (e.g. failure of a primary link of a VPLS PE and
   implicitly the activation of an alternate link in a dual-homing use
   case). These existing procedures apply individually to B-VPLS and I-
   component domains.

   When it comes to reflecting topology changes in access networks
   connected to I-component across the B-VPLS domain certain additions
   should be considered as described below.

   MAC Switching in PBB is based on the mapping of Customer MACs (CMACs)
   to Backbone MAC(s) (BMACs). A topology change in the access (I-
   domain) should just invoke the flushing of CMAC entries in PBB PEs'
   FIB(s) associated with the I-component(s) impacted by the failure.
   There is a need to indicate the PBB PE (BMAC source) that originated
   the MAC Flush message to selectively flush only the MACs that are
   affected.

   These goals can be achieved by adding a new MAC Flush Parameters TLV
   in the LDP Address Withdraw message to indicate the particular
   domain(s) requiring MAC flush. On the other end, the receiving PEs
   may use the information from the new TLV to flush only the related
   FIB entry/entries in the I-component instance(s).



  4.2.1. MAC Flush Parameters TLV format

   The MAC Flush Parameters TLV is described as below:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   The U and F bits are set to forward if unknown so that potential
   intermediate VPLS PEs unaware of the new TLV can just propagate it
   transparently. The MAC Flush Parameters TLV type is to be assigned by
   IANA. The encoding of the TLV follows the standard LDP TLV encoding
   in [RFC5036].

   The TLV value field contains an one byte Flag field used as described
   below. Further the TLV value may carry one or more sub-TLVs. Any sub-
   TLV definition to the above TLV MUST address the actions in
   combination with other existing sub-TLVs.

   The detailed format for the Flags bit vector is described below:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   |C|N|    MBZ    | (MBZ = MUST Be Zero)

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   1 Byte Flag field is mandatory. The following flags are defined :

     C flag, used to indicate the context of the PBB-VPLS component in
     which MAC flush is required. For PBB-VPLS there are two contexts of
     MAC flushing - The Backbone VPLS (B-component VPLS) and Customer
     VPLS (I-component VPLS). C flag MUST be ZERO (C=0) when a MAC Flush
     for the B-VPLS is required. C flag MUST be set (C=1) when the MAC
     Flush for I-VPLS is required.

     N flag, used to indicate whether a positive (N=0, Flush-all-but-
     mine) or negative (N=1 Flush-all-from-me) MAC Flush is required.
     The source (mine/me) is defined either as the PW associated with
     the LDP session on which the LDP MAC Withdraw was received or with
     the BMAC(s) listed in the BMAC Sub-TLV.

     MBZ flags, the rest of the flags should be set to zero on
     transmission and ignored on reception.

   The following sub-TLVs MUST be included in the MAC Flush Parameters
   TLV if the C-flag is set to 1:

   - PBB BMAC List sub-TLV:

   Type: 0x01




Dutta, et. al           Expires April 25, 2010                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft    Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS   October 25, 2010


   Length: value length in octets. At least one BMAC address must be
   present in the list.

   Value: one or a list of 48 bits BMAC addresses. These are the source
   BMAC addresses associated with the B-VPLS instance that originated
   the MAC Withdraw message. It will be used to identify the CMAC(s)
   mapped to the BMAC(s) listed in the sub-TLV.

   - PBB ISID List sub-TLV:

   Type: 0x02,

   Length: value length in octets. Zero indicates an empty ISID list. An
   empty ISID list means that the flush applies to all the ISIDs mapped
   to the B-VPLS indicated by the FEC TLV.

   Value: one or a list of 24 bits ISIDs that represent the I-component
   FIB(s) where the MAC Flush needs to take place.

  4.2.2. MAC Flush Parameters TLV Processing Rules

   The following steps describe the details of the processing for the
   related LDP Address Withdraw message:

   . The LDP MAC Withdraw Message, including the MAC Flush Parameters
     TLV is initiated by the PBB PE(s) experiencing a Topology Change
     event in one or multiple customer I-component(s).

          o The flags are set accordingly to indicate the type of MAC
             Flush required for this event: N=0 (Flush-all-but-mine),
             C=1 (Flush only CMAC FIBs).

          o The PBB Sub-TLVs (BMAC and ISID Lists) are included
             according to the context of topology change.

   . On reception of the LDP Address Withdrawal message, the B-VPLS
     instances corresponding to the FEC TLV in the message must
     interpret the content of MAC Flush Parameters TLV. If the C-bit is
     set to 1 then Backbone Core Bridges (BCB) in the PBB-VPLS SHOULD
     NOT flush their BMAC FIBs. The B-VPLS control plane SHOULD
     propagate the MAC Flush following the split-horizon grouping and
     the established B-VPLS topology.

   . The usage and processing rules of MAC Flush Parameters TLV in the
     context of Backbone Edge Bridges (BEB) is as follows:

   .


Dutta, et. al           Expires April 25, 2010                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft    Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS   October 25, 2010


          o  The PBB ISID List is used to determine the particular ISID
             FIBs (I-VPLS) that need to be flushed. If the ISID List is
             empty then all the ISID FIBs associated with the receiving
             B-VPLS SHOULD be flushed.

          o  The PBB BMAC List is used to identify from the ISID FIBs
             in the previous step to selectively flush BMAC to CMAC
             associations depending on the N flag specified below.

   .  Next, depending on the N flag value the following actions apply:

          o  N=0, all the CMACs in the selected ISID FIBs SHOULD be
             flushed with the exception of the resulted CMAC list from
             the BMAC List mentioned in the message. ("Flush all but the
             CMACs associated with the BMAC(s) in the BMAC List Sub-TLV
             from the FIBs associated with the ISID list").

          o  N=1, the resulted CMAC list SHOULD be flushed ("Flush all
             the CMACs associated with the BMAC(s) in the BMAC List Sub-
             TLV from the FIBs associated with the ISID list").

   4.2.3 Applicability of MAC Flush Parameters TLV

         If MAC Flush Parameters TLV is received by a BEB in a PBB-VPLS
   that does not understand the TLV then it may result in undesirable
   MAC flushing action. It is RECOMMENDED that all PE devices
   participating in PBB-VPLS support MAC Flush Parameters TLV.

        The MAC Flush Parameters TLV is also applicable to regular VPLS
   context as well. To achieve negative MAC Flush (flush-all-from-me) in
   regular VPLS context, the MAC Flush Parameters TLV SHOULD be encoded
   with C=0 and N = 1 without inclusion of any Sub-TLVs. Negative MAC
   flush is highly desirable in scenarios when VPLS access redundancy is
   provided by Ethernet Ring Protection as specified in ITU-T G.8032
   specification etc.

   - This specification does not have any impact on the VPLS forwarding
   plane.

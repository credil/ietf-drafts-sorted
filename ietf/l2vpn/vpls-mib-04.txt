Abstract

    This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
    Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
    Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects

1  Introduction

    This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
    (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
    community. In particular, it defines a MIB module that can be
    used to manage VPLS(Virtual Private LAN  Services for transmission
    over a packet Switched Network (PSN) using LDP [RFC4762] or
    BGP[RFC4761] signalling. This MIB module provides generic
    management of VPLS services as defined by the IETF L2VPN Working
    Group.

    Comments should be made directly to the L2VPN mailing list at
    l2vpn@ietf.org.

2  Terminology

    This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
    described in [RFC3985]. Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of
    [RFC3985] apply and will not be re-described here.

3  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7
    of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
    termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
    generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
    (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
    defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This
    memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which
    is described in STD 58,[RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, 
    [RFC2580].

4  VPLS MIB Module Architecture

    The MIB structure for defining a VPLS service is composed from four
    types of MIB modules.

         draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mib-04 L2-VPN-MIB         Apr 07, 2010



    The first type is the VPLS-GENERIC-DRAFT-01-MIB module, which
    configures general parameters of the VPLS service that are common
    to all types of emulated services.

    The second type is the VPLS-LDP-DRAFT-01-MIB module, which
    configures VPLS-LDP[RFC4762] specific parameters of the
    VPLS service.

    The third type is the VPLS-BGP-DRAFT-01-MIB module, which configures
    VPLS-BGP[RFC4761] specific parameters of the
    VPLS service.

    The fourth type of modules are service-specific modules, which are
    defined in other documents.

4.1 VPLS-GENERIC-DRAFT-01-MIB Module Usage
      An entry in the vplsConfigTable MUST exist for a VPLS service.
     This table holds generic parameters which apply to a VPLS service
     which can be signalled via LDP or BGP.

    A conceptual row can be created in the vplsConfigTable in one of
    the following ways:

    1) The operator creates a row in the vplsConfigTable when
        configuring the node for a new service. This mode MUST be
        supported by the agent, and MUST be used when creating a
        manually assigned VPLS service.

    2) The agent MAY create a row in the vplsConfigTable automatically
        due to some auto discovery application, or based on
        configuration that is done through non-SNMP applications.
       This mode is OPTIONAL.

      An entry in the vplsPwBindTable MUST exist for a VPLS service.
     This binding table links one VPLS service with one or many

     pseudo wires (defined in [RFC5601]). The pseudo wire may
     be used as a spoke or a mesh based on the parameters defined
     in this table.
     An entry in the vplsBgpAdConfigTable MUST exist if 
     Auto-discovery has been enabled on this service. This table 
     stores the information required for auto-discovery. 

     An entry in the vplsBgpRteTargetTable MUST exist if auto-discovery 
     has been configured on this service. One service can import 
     and export multiple Route targets. 

     The agent than creates the rows in the (locally supported)
     performance tables and reverse mapping tables in
     VPLS-GENERIC-DRAFT-01-MIB module.

4.2 VPLS-LDP-DRAFT-01-MIB Module Usage

     An entry in the vplsLdpConfigTable MUST be created by the agent
     for a VPLS service signalled using LDP.

4.3 VPLS-BGP-DRAFT-01-MIB Module Usage

     An entry in the vplsBgpConfigTable MUST be created by the agent
     for a VPLS service signalled using BGP.


4.4 Relations to other MIB modules

     - The vplsPwBindTable links the VPLS entry to various entries in
        the [RFC5601]

     - The association of MAC addresses to VPLS entries is possible
       by adding a turnstile function to interpret the entries in 
       [SNMP-CONTEXT-MAP-MIB]. In [SNMP-CONTEXT-MAP-MIB] there is 
       a mapping between the vacmContextName[RFC3415] to 
       dot1dBasePort[RFC4188] and vplsConfigIndex. This mapping can
       be used to map the vplsConfigIndex to a dot1dBasePort 
       in the BRIDGE-MIB. This resulting value of dot1dBasePort
       can be used to access corresponding MAC addresses that belong
       to a particular vplsConfigIndex.

     - Unless all the necessary entries in the applicable tables have
       been created and all the parameters have been consistently
       configured in those tables, signaling cannot be performed
       from the local node, and the ??? should report 'notPresent'.

     - Statistics can be gathered from the [RFC5601] - TBD

5  Example of the VPLS MIB modules usage

    In this section we provide an example of using the MIB objects
    described in section 7 to set up a VPLS service over MPLS. While
    this example is not meant to illustrate every permutation of the
    MIB, it is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key
    concepts. It is meant to be read after going through the MIB
    itself.

    In the VPLS-GENERIC-DRAFT-01-MIB module:

    In vplsConfigTable:
    {
         vplsConfigIndex                         10,
         vplsConfigName                          "VPLS-A"
         vplsConfigAdminStatus                   1(up),
         vplsConfigMacLearning                   1(true),
         vplsConfigDiscardUnknownDest            2(false),
         vplsConfigMacAging                      1(true),
         vplsConfigVpnId                         "100:10"
         vplsConfigRowStatus                     1(active)
   }

   In vplsStatusTable:
   {
        vplsStatusOperStatus                    1(up),
   }

   In the VPLS-LDP-DRAFT-01-MIB module:

   In vplsLdpConfigTable:
   {
         vplsLdpConfigMacAddrWithdraw            1(true),
        

   }

   In vplsLdpPwBindTable:
   {
         vplsLdpPwBindType                 1(mesh),
         vplsLdpPwBindMacAddressLimit      100
   }

7. Security Considerations

   It is clear that the MIB modules described in this document in
   association with the PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] are potentially
   useful for monitoring of GMPLS LSRs. These MIB modules can also be
   used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be
   configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous
   results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB modules
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on

   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

8. IANA Considerations

-- We request that you assign contiguous RFC numbers to the

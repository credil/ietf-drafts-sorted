Internet-Draft       VPMS Framework and Requirements            Oct 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Problem Statement

   [RFC4664] describes different types of Provider Provisioned Layer 2
   VPNs (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs).  Some of them are widely deployed today,
   such as Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN
   Service (VPLS).  A VPWS is a VPN service that supplies a Layer 2 (L2)
   point-to-point service.  A VPLS is an L2 service that emulates
   Ethernet LAN service across a Wide Area Network (WAN).

   For some use cases described hereafter, there are P2MP (point-to-
   multipoint) type services for Layer 2 traffic.  However, there is no
   straightforward way to realize them based on the existing L2VPN
   specifications.

   In a VPWS, a SP can set up point-to-point connectivity per a pair of
   CEs but it is not possible to replicate traffic for point-to-
   multipoint services in the SP's network side.  A SP could build
   multiple Pseudowires (PWs) independently and have the CEs replicate
   traffic over them, but this is not only inconvenient for the
   customer, it's a waste of bandwidth resources.

   In a VPLS, SPs can natively offer multipoint connectivity across
   their backbone.  Although it is seemingly applicable for point-to-
   multipoint service as well, there remains extra complexity for SPs to
   filter unnecessary traffic between irrelevant sites (i.e., from a
   receiver PE to another receiver PE) because VPLS provides multipoint-
   to-multipoint connectivity between CEs.  Moreover, VPLS's MAC-based
   learning/forwarding operation is unnecessary for some scenarios
   particularly if customers only need simple unidirectional point-to-
   multipoint service, or if they require non- Ethernet Layer 2
   connectivity.

   Consequently, there is a real need for a solution that natively
   provides point-to-multipoint service in L2VPN.

1.2.  Scope of This Document

   VPMS is defined as a Layer 2 service that provides point-to-
   multipoint connectivity for a variety of Layer2 link layers across an
   IP or MPLS-enabled PSN.  VPMS is categorized as a class of provider-
   provisioned Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN).

   This document introduces a new service framework, reference model and
   functional requirements for VPMS by extending the existing framework
   [RFC4664] and requirements [RFC4665] for L2VPNs.

   P2MP connection:  A logical entity between PE/ACs in a given VPMS
      instance that transfers unidirectional traffic transparently from
      one local ingress AC to one or more remote egress ACs.


4.  Use Cases

4.1.  Ethernet Use Case

4.1.1.  Ethernet-based multicast stream

   For multicast traffic delivery, there is a requirement to deliver a
   unidirectional P2MP service in addition to the existing P2P service.
   The demand is growing to provide private (P2MP native Ethernet)
   services, for various applications such as IP- based delivery of TV
   broadcasting, content delivery networks, etc.  Moreover, many digital
   audio/video devices (e.g., MPEG-TS, HD-SDI) that supports Ethernet
   interfaces are becoming available, which will make Ethernet P2MP
   service more common.  Also there are some applications that naturally
   suited to static transport of VPMS.  For example, MPEG-TS/IP/
   Ethernet in DVB-H is typically static broadcast without any signaling
   in the upstream direction.  VPMS could be a possible solution to
   provide these kinds of networking connectivity over PSNs.

   Currently VPLS [RFC4761][RFC4762] is able to give P2MP-type
   replication for Ethernet traffic.  Native VPLS already supports this
   capability via a full mesh of PWs, and an extension to optimize
   replication is also proposed [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast] as an
   additional feature.  However, VPLS by nature requires MAC-based
   learning and forwarding, which might not be needed in some cases by
   particular users.  Generally, video distribution applications use
   unidirectional P2MP traffic, but may not always require any added
   complexity of MAC address management.  In addition, VPLS is a service
   that essentially provides any-to-any connectivity between all CEs in
   a L2VPN as it emulates a LAN service.  However, if only P2MP
   connectivity is required, the traffic between leaves is not allowed.
   It might require extra efforts to guarantee this behavior in VPLS.
   And in some P2MP scenarios there no traffic from leafs to root.  In
   these cases, VPMS is a service that provides much simpler operation.

   Note that VPMS provides single coverage of receiver membership; that
   is, there is no distinct differentiation for multiple multicast
   groups.  All traffic from a particular Attachment Circuit (AC) will
   be forwarded toward the same remote receivers, even if the
   destination MAC address is changed.  Basically in VPMS, destination
   MAC addresses are not used for forwarding, which is significantly
   different from VPLS.  If MAC-based forwarding is preferred (i.e.,
   multicast/unicast differentiation of MAC address), VPLS should be

   chosen rather than VPMS.

4.1.2.  Ethernet-based time/frequency synchronization

   Nowadays there exist several solutions to provide synchronization for
   time and/or frequency reference by the packet-based technology of
   Ethernet.  For example, PTPv2 (Precision Time Protocol version 2) is
   a time-transfer protocol defined in the IEEEE1588-2008 standard.  It
   provides precise synchronization of packet-based networks (e.g.,
   Ethernet).  It adopts two-way time transfer approach for
   synchronization.  Time transfer protocol may be operated in multicast
   or unicast mode in both directions, and it is mapped over the
   Ethernet/IP/UDP protocol stack.

   Moreover, PTPv2 telecom profile is now discussed in ITU-T that
   defines a set of capabilities and extensions required to support
   telecommunication applications.  It aims at providing frequency
   distribution with higher level of accuracy.  It allows unicast mode
   or the mix of unicast/multicast modes for the transmission of the PTP
   messages.

   In this aspect, VPMS might be considered as a potential packet-based
   infrastructure to deliver multicast messages in PTPv2 with efficient
   forwarding.  Note, however, in PTPv2 telecom profile, multicast
   transport may not always be supported in all the parts of a telecom
   network because multicast might sometimes generate additional PDV
   (packet delay variation) compared to unicast.  Therefore, VPMS use
   case and the corresponding solution for this purpose will need more
   study in the future (e.g., PDV issue to be checked).

4.2.  ATM-based Use Case

4.2.1.  ATM-based multicast stream

   A use case of ATM-based service in VPMS could be to offer the
   capability for service providers to support IP multicast wholesale
   services over ATM in case the wholesale customer relies on ATM
   infrastructure.  The P2MP support alleviates the constraint in terms
   of replication for ATM to support IP multicast services.

   Another use case of VPMS for ATM is for audio/video stream
   applications.  Today many digital TV broadcasting networks adopt ATM-
   based distribution systems with point-to-multipoint PVPs/PVCs.  The
   transport network supports replicating ATM cells in transit nodes to
   efficiently deliver programs to multiple terminals.  For migrating
   such ATM-based networks onto IP/MPLS-based networks, VPMS is
   considered to be a candidate solution.

Internet-Draft       VPMS Framework and Requirements            Oct 2009


4.3.  TDM-based Use Case

4.3.1.  TDM-based multicast stream

   Today the existing VPWS already supports TDM emulation services
   (SAToP, CESoPSN or TDMoIP).  It is a Layer 1 service, not Layer 2
   service; however, a common architecture is being used since they are
   all packet-based emulations over a SP's network.  VPMS is also
   considered to be a solution for such TDM applications that require
   point-to-multipoint topology.

   One use case is TDM-based multicast stream delivery, like video
   delivery.  That is, data duplication is simply provided by Layer 1,
   without using upper layer's multicast protocols.

                     Figure 1: Reference Model for VPMS

   A VPMS instance is defined as a service entity manageable in the VPMS
   architecture.  A single VPMS instance provides an isolated service
   reachability domain to each CE, so it corresponds to a so-called
   "VPN" as it allows communication among a specific set of sites.  A
   single VPMS instance provides a unique point-to-multipoint L2VPN
   service.  In Figure 1, there are two VPMS instances shown, VPMS A and
   VPMS B. In principle, there is no traffic exchange allowed between
   these different instances, so they are treated as different VPNs.

   In a VPMS, a single CE-PE link connection is used for transmitting
   frames for delivery to multiple remote CEs, with point-to-multipoint
   duplication.  The SP's network (PE as well as P) has a role to
   replicate frames so that the sender's CE does not need to send
   multiple frames to individual receivers.

   Like VPWS, an Attachment Circuit (AC) is provided to accommodate CEs
   in a VPMS.  In a VPMS, an AC attached to a VPMS MUST be configured as
   "root" (sender) or "leaf" (receiver) not both.  Any AC is associated
   with the role of either sending side (Tx) or receiving side (Rx) from
   the view of the CE.  These will be named the root (sender) AC and
   leaf (receiver) AC respectively.  Unless reverse traffic is
   optionally supported, a root AC does not transmit traffic back to a
   CE at upstream side, likewise a leaf AC does not receive traffic from
   a CE at downstream side.  In Figure 1, AC1 and AC3 are configured as
   root ACs while AC2, AC4, AC5 and AC6 are configured as leaf ACs.  In
   VPMS A, CE1 could send traffic via AC1, and CE2 and CE5 could receive
   the traffic.

   A CE which is locally connected to a root AC is called a root
   (sender) CE.  Also a CE which is locally connected to a leaf AC is
   called a leaf (receiver) CE.  However, such CEs's roles will not be
   managed directly in VPMS because the configured AC's role (root or
   leaf) will automatically determine them.

   Similarly, a PE which locally accommodates a root AC is called a root
   (sender) PE.  A PE which locally accommodates a leaf AC is called a
   leaf (receiver) PE.

   Basically there is a one-to-one mapping between an attachment circuit
   and a VPMS instance.  For example, all traffic from CE1 to PE1
   (through AC1) is mapped to VPMS A (to CE2 and CE5).

   In a VPMS, P2MP tree-shaped reachability is given from a single root
   AC to several leaf ACs.  This will be named a "P2MP connection" in

   this VPMS framework.  P2MP connection is a logical entity between PE/
   ACs in a given VPMS instance that transfers unidirectional traffic
   transparently from one local ingress AC to one or more remote egress
   ACs.

   Similar to other L2VPN mechanisms, the VPMS architecture is based on
   PWs which may be using through IP or MPLS-enabled PSN tunnels over a
   routed backbone.  That is, every P2MP connection can be instantiated
   by PW technology that supports P2MP traffic optimization (i.e., P2MP
   PW.  See section 7.2.).  P2MP traffic optimization will provide the
   benefit of traffic replication for high bandwidth efficiency.  That
   is, the sender CE has only to transmit one stream towards the PE and
   it does not have to replicate traffic.

   Regarding end-to-end traffic topology between the ACs, a single VPMS
   instance (i.e., one VPN) may correspond to a single P2MP connection.
   In Figure 1, VPMS A (one instance) has one P2MP connection (from AC1
   to AC2 and AC5).  However, there is also a case that a single VPMS
   consists of two or more P2MP connections grouped, which is typically
   used for redundancy.  The details are given in section 6.4.

   VPMS can support various Layer 2 protocol services such as Ethernet,
   ATM, etc.


6.  Customer Requirements

6.1.  Service Topology

6.1.1.  Point-to-Multipoint Traffic Support

   A solution MUST support unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic
   from a sender CE to multiple receiver CEs.  A root CE can send
   traffic to one or more leaf CEs.  Leaf CEs include not only the CEs
   which are located at remote sites, but also the local CEs which are
   connected to the same root PE.  If there is only one receiver in the
   instance, it is considered equivalent to unidirectional point-to-
   point traffic.

6.1.2.  Reverse Traffic Support

   There are cases where a reverse traffic flow is needed.  A root CE
   may need to receive traffic from leaf CEs.  There are some usage
   scenarios for this, such as stream monitoring through a loopback
   mechanism, control channels which need feedback communication etc.  A
   possible way to accomplish this is to provide different VPMS
   instances for reverse traffic, i.e. a root CE is a receiver of
   another VPMS instance.  However, provisioning different VPNs for a

   particular customer would make its management task more complex.  It
   is desired to have an alternative solution for supporting reverse
   traffic flow.  This section provides additional requirements for this
   optional capability.

   A VPMS solution MAY support reverse traffic from a leaf AC to a root
   AC.  Each reverse path is basically given in a P2P (unicast) manner.
   In other words, each leaf of the P2MP tree can individually send back
   traffic to the root.  For this purpose a VPMS instance MAY have more
   than one reverse P2P connections as network entity; However, such
   network entities MUST have a common indetifier that enables
   themselves to be managed together in the same VPN.  Thus any PWs used
   for such connections are expected to be assigned a common VPMS
   instance ID (i.e., VPN ID).

   Note, a VPMS does not assume any-to-any multipoint reachability.
   Therefore, in principle, every leaf AC does not exchange traffic
   directly with other leaf ACs even if reverse traffic is supported.

   Figure 3 illustrates this kind of scenario, where CE1 is configured
   as a sender in VPMS A. AC1 is a root AC, and AC2/AC3/AC4 are leaf
   ACs.  P2MP connection is given for forward traffic.  Unidirectional
   P2P connection is also provided for reverse traffic from AC4 to AC1.
   Other reverse P2P connections can be provided similarly. (from AC2 to
   AC1 / from AC3 to AC1).

   In this case, PEs need to deal with two types of traffic, locally-
   attached CE's sending (Tx) and receiving (Rx) flows.  In Figure 3,
   they are both passing through the same physical PE-CE link (AC1 and
   AC4 respectively).  But it is an implementation matter if Tx and Rx
   traffic are conveyed on the same physical link or separate links.  It
   is also possible that a root PE multiplexes two ore more reverse
   traffic from different leaves and transmits it to an upstream CE over
   the same local physical link.

   Note, in most implementations of VPWS today, every AC is always
   considered bidirectional.  In contrast, in VPMS, every AC can be
   chosen unidirectional (if it is a totally unidirectional service), or
   bidirectional (if reverse traffic is supported).

6.2.  Transparency

   A solution is intended to provide Layer-2 traffic transparency.
   Transparency SHOULD be supported per VPMS instance basis.  In other
   words, Layer-2 traffic can be transparently transported from a local
   CE to remote CEs in a given instance.  Note, however, if service
   delimiting fields (VLAN Id in Ethernet, VPI/VCI in ATM, DLCI in FR
   etc.) are assigned by the SP, the Layer-2 traffic is not necessarily
   transparent.  It will depend on the SP's choice if they assign it to
   each AC.  Hence, it could be that some of the leaf CEs are receiving
   traffic that has different delimiting fields than the traffic for the

   other leaf CEs.  Hence, it could be that some of receiver CEs are
   getting traffic with different delimiting fields than the other
   receiver CEs.

   The VPMS solution SHOULD NOT require any special packet processing by
   the end users (CEs).

6.3.  Quality of Service (QoS)

   A customer may require that the VPMS service provide guaranteed QoS.
   In particular, for real time applications which are considered common
   in point-to-multipoint delivery, delay and loss sensitive traffic
   MUST be supported.  The solution SHOULD provide native QoS techniques
   for service class differentiation, such as IEEE 802.1p CoS for
   Ethernet.

   For bandwidth committed services (e.g., ATM CBR), a solution SHOULD
   guarantee end-to-end bandwidth.  It MAY provide flow admission
   control mechanisms to achieve that.

6.4.  High Availability

   A solution MUST provide protection and restoration mechanism for end-
   to-end services to ensure high availability.

   There are multiple parts of the connection that can support
   protection and restoration: (1) CE to PE, (2) between PEs (3) inside
   core (PSN backbone).  It is expected that (3) is fulfilled by
   existing PSN protection mechanisms (e.g., RSVP-TE FRR).  Following
   subsections covers the requirements for redundancy support for (1)
   and (2).

6.4.1.  Dual-homed Access Support

   A solution MUST allow dual-homed redundant access from a CE to
   multiple PEs.  This if beneficial to support reliable data delivery
   for customers.  Figure 3 provides an example of this access topology.

                       Figure 3: Dual-homing support

   A solution SHOULD provide a protection mechanism between the
   redundant PEs to which a CE is dual-homed.  This is because when an
   ingress root PE node fails whole traffic delivery will fail unless a
   backup root PE is provided, even in case of dual-homed access.
   Similarly, if an egress leaf PE node fails, traffic toward that CE is
   never received unless a backup leaf PE is provided.

   In some cases, the data source is required to be highly reliable
   since it is often deployed as a centralized server that provides
   traffic to many receivers.  Therefore, there is an additional
   requirement specifically about redundancy of root-side: each VPMS
   instance SHOULD be able to have multiple P2MP connections whose roots
   are located at separate root ACs.  Those root ACs can be located at
   physically separate root PEs, whereas those trees will share common
   leaf ACs.  This means that each P2MP connection has a single root AC,
   but several P2MP connections can be managed together inside a common
   VPN.

   For example, in Figure 4, traffic from root AC1 and AC2 both reach
   receivers CE3 and CE4 while AC1, AC2, AC3 and AC4 all are associated
   with a single VPMS instance.  This topology is reliable since there
   are redundant root PE/ACs.  At the egress side, PE3 and PE4 select
   traffic from either root, PE1 or PE2.  In this figure, each leaf PE
   has one leaf AC only (AC3 attached to PE3, and AC4 attached to PE4).
   Therefore, PEs will need to support PW protection and restoration
   mechanism so that two redundant P2MP connections are given among
   common ACs.

   Note, if the solution supports dual-homed sender scenario to provide
   multiple root ACs like, it is expected that such a mechanism can also

   be used in multi-source scenrio.  For example, suppose in TV
   provisioning scenario, a leaf (receiver) CE has the fixed one
   interface to the leaf PE, and the CE needs to receive many TV channel
   traffic from two video servers (the two servers provide different TV
   channels).  The two video servers are in different location.  In this
   case, there need two root ACs and the same number of P2MP
   connections, which is similar to dual-homed sender case.  If the root
   CE shown in Figure 4 is given physically separated, such a topology
   is equivalent to this multi-source scenario.

6.4.2.  Single/Dual Traffic Support in Dual-homed Access

   When dual-homed access to root PEs is provided, a solution MAY allow
   a sender CE to transmit just a single copy of the traffic to either
   one of the two root (ingress) PEs or to transmit a copy of the
   traffic to both the PEs simultaneously.  The latter scenario consumes
   more resource of CE-PE link than the single traffic scenario, but it
   is usually applicable when a source device has only a simple
   forwarding capability without any switchover functionality.  In the
   dual traffic case, the backup root (ingress) PE SHOULD be able to
   filter the incoming unnecessary traffic while the other root PE is
   active if it is needed by SP.  In either case, single traffic or dual
   traffic, the switchover mechanism between root (ingress) PEs will be
   necessary to handle traffic appropriately in case of failure.

   In the case of dual-homed access to leaf PEs, a solution MAY allow a
   receiver CE to receive a single copy of the traffic from either one
   of the two leaf (egress) PEs, or receive a copy of the traffic from
   both PEs simultaneously.  The dual traffic approach is applicable if
   CE has fast switchover capability as a receiver by selecting either
   one of incoming traffic, but note that additional traffic resources
   are always consumed at PE-CE link of backup side.  Specifically in
   the single traffic case, it might be needed to support switchover
   mechanism between egress PEs in case of failure.

6.5.  Security

   The basic security requirements from the view of customers are raised
   in section 6.5 of [RFC4665].  It also applies to VPMS.

   In addition, a VPMS solution MAY have the mechanisms to activate the
   appropriate filtering capabilities (for example, MAC/VLAN filtering
   etc.), and it MAY be added with the control mechanism between
   particular sender/receiver sites inside a VPMS instance.  For
   example, in Figure 1, filtering can be added such that traffic from
   CE1 to CE4/CE5 is allowed but traffic from CE1 to CE6 is filtered.

Internet-Draft       VPMS Framework and Requirements            Oct 2009


6.6.  Reordering Prevention

   A solution SHOULD prevent Layer-2 frame reordering when delivering
   customer traffic under normal conditions.

6.7.  Failure reporting

   A solution MAY provide information to the customer about failures.
   For example, if there is a loss of connectivity toward some of the
   receiver CEs, it is reported to the sender CE.


7.  Service Provider Network Requirements

7.1.  Scalability

   A VPMS solution MUST be designed to scale well with an increase in
   the number of any of the following metrics:

   -  the number of PEs (per VPMS instance and total in a SP network)
   -  the number of VPMS instances (per PE and total)
   -  the number of root ACs / sender CEs (per PE, VPMS instance and
      total)
   -  the number of leaf ACs / receiver CEs (per PE, VPMS instance and
      total)

   A VPMS solution SHALL document its scalability characteristics in
   quantitative terms.  A solution SHOULD quantify the amount of state
   that a PE and a P device has to support.

   The scalability characteristics SHOULD include:

   -  the processing resources required by the control plane in managing
      PWs (neighborhood or session maintenance messages, keepalives,
      timers, etc.)
   -  the processing resources required by the control plane in managing
      PSN tunnels
   -  the memory resources needed for the control plane
   -  other particular elements inherent to each solution that impact
      scalability

7.2.  Pseudo Wire Signaling and PSN Tunneling

   A VPMS solution SHOULD provide an efficient replication that can
   contribute to optimizing the bandwidth usage required in a SP's
   network.  For supporting efficient replication, it is expected to
   take advantage of PW and PSN mechanisms that are capable of P2MP

Internet-Draft       VPMS Framework and Requirements            Oct 2009


   Regarding PW mechanism, [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements]
   introduces P2MP PW concept and its requirements, showing two basic
   approaches of providing replication.  One is SS (Single Segment)-PW
   model that provides replication by PSN tunnel such as P2MP LSP (i.e.,
   by outer label layer), and the other is MS (Multi Segment)-PW model
   that provides replication by multiple interconnected PWs (i.e., by
   inner label layer).  In either case, end-to-end P2MP topology (i.e.,
   P2MP connection) in VPMS is common from the view of ACs.
   Requirements as a provider service specified in this document will be
   commonly applied regardless of P2MP PW's signaling model.

   It is out of scope of this document how to extend and use PW
   mechanisms to realize P2MP connections.  For example, it is under the
   scope of the solution work how to support forward/reverse traffic
   e.g., by a single PW signaling, coupling multiple PWs, or other ways.

   This document does not raise any specific requirements for particular
   PSN tunneling schemes (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and
   multipoint-to-multipoint) that are applied to VPMS.  The actual type
   of PSN tunnel used in VPMS will be dependent on individual deployment
   scenarios (e.g., which PSN protocol is available in the core and how
   much of the network resources that operators will want to optimize).

7.3.  Auto-discovery

   A solution SHOULD support auto-discovery methods that dynamically
   allow VPMS related information to be discovered by the PEs to
   minimize the amount of configuration the SP must perform.

   All of the requirements on discovery described in Section 7.3 of
   [RFC4665] SHOULD be satisfied in VPMS as well.

   Auto-discovery will help operators' initial configuration of adding a
   new VPN (i.e., VPMS instance), adding/deleting new sender/receiver,
   and so on.

   The candidate information treated in auto-discovery will be as
   follows:

   -  Information to indentify the location of each PE, e.g., PE router
      ID / IP address
   -  Information to identify the VPMS instance, that is, to identify a
      VPN
   -  Information to identify the type of ACs (root AC or leaf AC)







Kamite, et al.           Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft       VPMS Framework and Requirements            Oct 2009


   -  Information to identify the P2MP connection that binds ACs
   -  Information to show if reverse traffic support is optionally
      desired
   -  SP-related information (AS number, etc. for an inter-provider
      case)

   Following is an example scenario about adding a new leaf PE: suppose
   there are three PEs in an existing VPMS, PE1, PE2, PE3.  PE1 is a
   root PE and has a AC1.  PE2 and PE3 are leaves and have AC2 and AC3.
   every PE has the association among the information described above.
   Now a new PE4 having an AC4 is provisioned in the existing VPMS
   instance and this AC is configured as leaf.  This information will be
   automatically discovered by the other existing remote PEs (i.e.,
   ingress and egress PEs in the same VPMS instance).  Once the ingress
   PE1 discovers this new PE/AC, it can automatically add AC4 as the new
   leaf of P2MP connection topology according to P2MP PW signaling
   mechanism.  The ingress PE1 will graft a new leaf (PE4) to the
   already existing P2MP connection which is now created from AC1 to
   AC2/AC3/AC4.  This operation does not require any new configuration
   at the existing PEs.

   Another example is about adding new root PE: suppose there are one
   root PE (PE1/AC1) and three leaf PEs (PE2/AC2, PE3/AC3 and PE4/AC4).
   There is an existing P2MP connection from AC1 to AC2/AC3/AC4.  Now
   the operator adds a new root PE/AC (PE5/AC5) for some reasons (e.g.,
   multiple source sites, dual-homed access, root PE redundancy etc.).
   Then, auto-discovery mechanism advertises this information to all
   other members PE1/PE2/PE3/PE4, and a new P2MP connection from AC5 to
   AC2/AC3/AC4 is created by PW signaling.

   Note that VPMS instance is created when one root PE and at least one
   leaf PE are added.  In principle VPMS requires such minimum
   provisioning.  Hence in dual-homing case of sender, only backup root
   PE can be dynamically added/deleted to/from VPMS without destroying
   the VPN.

7.4.  Activation and Deactivation

   A solution SHOULD provide a way to activate/deactivate the
   administrative status of each AC.  After initial provisioning, a SP
   might change connectivity configuration between particular CEs inside
   a single VPMS instance for operational reasons.  This feature will be
   beneficial to help such a scenario.

   For example, in Figure 5, AC1, AC3, AC4 and AC5 are initially
   provisioned for VPMS A. AC2 is not provisioned for any VPMSes.  In
   VPMS A, CE1 is a sender and CE3, CE4 and CE5 are receivers.  Traffic
   will usually flow from CE1 to all receivers, CE3, CE4 and CE5.



Kamite, et al.           Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft       VPMS Framework and Requirements            Oct 2009


   However, for maintenance operation, application's request (e.g.,
   stream program has changed) or some other reasons, AC4 needs to be
   set as administratively deactivated.  Then it becomes necessary to
   turn off traffic from PE4 to CE4.  This operation must be
   appropriately distinguished from failure cases.

   When deactivating a particular site, backbone PSN/PW resources (e.g.,
   admission control of PSN tunnel) MAY be released for that particular
   direction in order to provide that bandwidth to other services.  In
   Figure 5, AC3 is now administratively activated and receiving
   traffic.  However, if AC3 comes to be administratively deactivated,
   and if RSVP-TE (including P2P and/or P2MP) is used for backbone PSN,
   then TE reserved resources from PE1 to PE3 may be released.

   In addition, a solution SHOULD allow single-sided activation
   operation at a root (ingress) PE.  In some scenarios, operators
   prefer centralized operation.  This is often considered natural for
   one-way digital audio/video distribution applications: SPs often want
   to complete their service delivery by a single operation at one
   source PE, not by multiple operations at many leaf (egress) PEs.
   Figure 5 illustrates this scenario, where a SP only has to do single-
   sided operation at PE1 (source) to administratively activate/
   deactivate various connections from AC1 to AC3, AC4 and/or AC5.  It
   is not needed to perform operations on PE3 and PE4 directly.

7.5.  Inter-AS Support

   A solution SHOULD support inter-AS scenarios, where there is more
   than one provider providing a common VPMS instance and VPN.  More
   specifically, it is necessary to consider the case where some of the
   PEs that compose one VPMS belong to several different ASes.

7.6.  Co-existence with Existing L2VPNs

   A solution MUST co-exist with the existing L2VPNs (e.g., VPWS, VPLS)
   across the same SP's network.  A solution MUST NOT impede the
   operation of auto-discovery and signaling mechanism that are already
   supported by the PEs for those existing L2VPNs.

7.7.  Operation, Administration and Maintenance

7.7.1.  Fault Management

7.7.1.1.  Fault Detection

   A solution MUST provide tools that detect reachability failure and
   traffic looping of data transport in a VPMS instance.  If multiple
   root ACs are supported (i.e., multiple P2MP connections are grouped
   together into a single VPMS instance), such tools MUST be able to
   perform distinguishing each P2MP connection.

7.7.1.2.  Fault Notification

   A solution MUST provide fault notification and trouble tracking
   mechanisms. (e.g.  SNMP-trap and syslog that notify fault to remote
   NMS.)

   In VPMS one point of failure at upstream often affects a number of
   downstream PEs and ACs that might raise a notification message.
   Hence notification messages MAY be summarized or compressed for
   operators' ease of management.

   In case of receiver-side failure (leaf PE or its AC), this fault
   status SHOULD be able to be monitored at root PE.  This will help an
   operator to monitor each leaf PE/AC in a centralized manner; that is,
   a root PE can collect leaf-side information.  How this status is
   transferred depends on a solution.

   In contrast, in case of sender-side failure (root PE or its AC), this
   fault status SHOULD also be able to be monitored at leaf PEs.  This
   will help an operator to troubleshoot at leaf PEs (i.e., distinguish
   local AC's failure from remote root AC's failure easily).

   In any case of failure at SP's network, fault information MAY be
   notified to the customer.  Specifically, such fault MAY trigger
   generating customer OAM message toward CEs (e.g., AIS) and/or
   shutting down leaf ACs.

7.7.1.3.  Fault Isolation

   A solution MUST provide diagnostic/troubleshooting tools for data
   transport in a VPMS instance.

7.7.2.  Testing

   A solution MUST provide a mechanism for testing each data
   connectivity and verifying the associated information in a VPMS



Kamite, et al.           Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft       VPMS Framework and Requirements            Oct 2009


   instance.  The connectivity is between a root and all leaf ACs (i.e.,
   each P2MP connection can be tested).

   Operators will run testing before and after service activation.
   Testing mechanism SHOULD support end-to-end testing of the data path
   used by customer's data.  End-to-end testing will have CE-to-CE path
   test and PE-to-PE path test.  A solution MUST support PE-to-PE path
   test and MAY support CE-to-CE path test.  In either case the minimum
   data path unit for each VPMS is unidirectional, hence if loopback
   testing is supported, additional consideration about reverse-path
   might also be needed (see section 6.1.2).

   If there are multiple P2MP connections for redundancy (active/backup
   tree) in a common VPMS (like in Figure 4), testing mechanism MUST be
   able to check the connectivity over not only working P2MP connection
   but also protecting connection(s).  This testing MUST be able to be
   performed from a root PE.  It MAY also be able to be performed from a
   sender CE.

7.7.3.  Performance Management

   A solution MUST offer mechanisms to monitor traffic performance
   parameters and statistics of data traffic in VPMS.

   A solution MUST provide access to:

   -  Traffic statistics (total traffic forwarded, incoming, outgoing,
      dropped, etc., by period of time)

   A solution SHOULD provide access to:

   -  Performance information related to traffic usage, e.g., one-way
      delay, one-way jitter, one-way loss, delay variations (the
      difference of various one-way delay from a particular root PE to
      multiple leaf PEs) etc.

   All or part of this information SHOULD be made available through
   standardized SNMP MIB Modules (Management Information Base).

   It is expected that such information can be used for SLA monitoring
   between sender and receiver, to give the SP a clear picture of
   current service providing to the customer.

7.8.  Security

   Section 7.6. of [RFC4665] describes common Layer-2 VPN security
   requirements from service provider aspect, which also applies to
   VPMS.  (For example, an SP network MUST be protected against



Kamite, et al.           Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft       VPMS Framework and Requirements            Oct 2009


   malformed or maliciously constructed customer traffic, etc.)

   This subsection adds VPMS-specific consideration and requirements.

   In VPMS, all traffic is transported with multicast duplication in
   terms of end-to-end perspective, regardless of customer's individual
   protocol.  A PE never processes CE's multicast control protocol
   (e.g., PIM, IGMP, MLD as Layer-3).  Hence, in PE and P, basically the
   security threat from malicious customer's C-plane protocol is small.

   In VPMS, there is security threat from malicious customers' D-plane
   traffic.  A PE might receive a high volume of data from a CE.  If
   there is no safeguard on PE, it will cause excessive replication in
   the SP network.  Therefore, a VPMS solution SHOULD support traffic
   policing to limit the unwanted data traffic.  Such a policing
   mechanism MUST be configurable per VPN basis, not the total of
   various VPNs to isolate malicious customer's traffic from others.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security requirements common to customers and service providers
   are raised in Section 5.5. of [RFC4665], which are fundamental for
   all Layer-2 VPN services.  VPMS is a variant of Layer-2 VPN, and that
   statement also applies to VPMS.

   Moreover, in this document, security requirements from the view of
   customers are shown in Section 6.5.  Security requirements from the
   view of providers are shown in Section 7.8.  They explain security
   considerations that are specific to VPMS.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

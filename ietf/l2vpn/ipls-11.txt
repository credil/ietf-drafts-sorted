Abstract 
    
   A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [VPLS] is used to interconnect 
   systems across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it 
   appear that they are on a private LAN.  The systems which are 
   interconnected may themselves be LAN switches.  If, however, they 
   are IP hosts or IP routers, certain simplifications to the operation 
   of the VPLS are possible.  We call this simplified type of VPLS an 
   "IP-only LAN Service" (IPLS).  In an IPLS, as in a VPLS, LAN 
   interfaces are run in promiscuous mode, and frames are forwarded 
   based on their destination MAC addresses.  However, the maintenance 
   of the MAC forwarding tables is done via signaling, rather than via 
   the MAC address learning procedures specified in [IEEE 802.1D].  
   This draft specifies the protocol extensions and procedures for 
   support of the IPLS service.

2.0 Overview 
    
   As emphasized in [VPLS], Ethernet has become popular as an access 
   technology in Metropolitan and Wide Area Networks. [VPLS] describes 
   how geographically dispersed customer LANs can be interconnected 
   over a service provider's network. The VPLS service is provided by 
   Provider Edge (PE) devices that connect Customer Edge (CE) devices. 
   The VPLS architecture provides this service by incorporating 
   bridging functions such as MAC address learning in the PE devices.  
    
   Provider Edge platforms are designed primarily to be IP routers, 
   rather than to be LAN switches. To add VPLS capability to a PE 
   router, one has to add MAC address learning capabilities, along with 
   aging and other mechanisms native to Ethernet switches. This may be 
   fairly complex to add to the forwarding plane architecture of an IP 
   router.  As discussed in [L2VPN-FWK], in scenarios where the CE 
   devices are NOT LAN switches, but rather are IP hosts or IP routers, 
   it is possible to provide the VPLS service without requiring MAC 
   address learning and aging on the PE.  Instead, a PE router has to 
   have the capability to match the destination MAC address in a packet 
   received from a CE to an outbound pseudowire.  The requirements for 
   the IPLS service are described in [L2VPN-REQTS]. The purpose of this 
   document is to specify a solution optimized for IPLS. 
    
   IPLS provides a VPLS-like service using PE routers that are not 
   designed to perform general LAN bridging functions. One must be 
   willing to accept the restriction that an IPLS be used for IP 
   traffic only, and not used to interconnect CE devices that are 
   themselves LAN switches. This is an acceptable restriction in many 
   environments, given that IP is the predominant type of traffic in 
   today's networks. 
    
   In IPLS, a PE device implements multi-point LAN connectivity for IP 
   traffic using the following key functions:  
    
     1. CE Address Discovery: Each Provider Edge (PE) device discovers 
        MAC address of the locally attached Customer Edge (CE) IP 
        devices, for each IPLS instance configured on the PE device. In 
        some configurations, PE also learns the IP address of the CE 
        device (when performing ARP proxy functions, described later in 
        the document).

     2. Pseudowire (PW) for Unicast Traffic: For each locally attached 
        CE device in a given IPLS instance, a PE device sets up a 
        pseudowire (PW-LSP) to each of the other PEs that supports the 
        same IPLS instance.   
 
        For instance, if PEx and PEy both support IPLS I, and PEy is 
        locally attached to CEa and CEb, PEy will initiate the setup of 
        two pseudowires between itself and PEx.  One of these will be 
        used to carry unicast traffic from any of PEx's CE devices to 
        CEa.  The other will be used to carry unicast traffic from any 
        of PEx's CE devices to CEb.   
         
        Note that these pseudowires carry traffic only in one 
        direction.  Further, while the pseudowire implicitly identifies 
        the destination CE of the traffic, it does not identify the 
        source CE; packets from different source CEs bound to the same 
        destination CE are sent on a single pseudowire. 
         
     3. Pseudowires for Multicast Traffic:  In addition, every PE 
        supporting a given IPLS instance will set up a special 
        'multicast pseudowire' to every other PE in that IPLS instance.  
        If, in the above example, one of PEx's CE devices sends a 
        multicast packet, PEx would forward the multicast packet to PEy 
        on the special 'multicast' pseudowire.  PEy would then send a 
        copy of that packet to CEa and a copy to CEb.  
    
        The 'multicast' pseudowire carries Ethernet frames of 
        multicast/broadcast IP, ARP and ICMP (Inverse) Neighbor 
        Discovery (ND/IND) packets for IPv6. Thus when a PE sends a 
        multicast packet across the network, it sends one copy to each 
        remote PE (supporting the given IPLS instance).  If a 
        particular remote PE has more than one CE device in that IPLS 
        instance, the remote PE must replicate the packet and send one 
        copy to each of its local CEs. 
         
        As with the pseudowires that are used for unicast traffic, 
        packets travel in only one direction on these pseudowires, and 
        packets from different sources may be freely intermixed. 
 
     4. Signaling:  The necessary pseudowires can be set up and 
        maintained using the LDP-based signaling procedures described 
        in [PWE3-CONTROL]. 
    
        A PE may assign the same label to each of the unicast 
        pseudowires that lead to a given CE device, in effect creating 
        a multipoint-to-point pseudowire. 
         
        Similarly, a PE may assign the same label to each of the 
        'multicast' pseudowires for a given IPLS instance, in effect 
        creating a multipoint-to-point pseudowire.

   Internet Draft    draft-ietf-l2vpn-ipls-11.txt 
                                    
    
         
        When setting up a pseudowire to be used for unicast traffic, 
        the PE must also signal the MAC address of the corresponding CE 
        device. It should also, optionally, advertise IP address of the 
        local CE device, especially when ARP proxy function is 
        configured or simply for operational management purposes. 
        Similarly, for IPv6 support, PE may optionally advertise the 
        IPv6 addresses of the local CE device. 
         
     5. ARP Packet Forwarding: ARP packets [ARP] are forwarded from 
        attachment circuit (AC) to 'multicast' pseudowires in the 
        Ethernet frame format as described by [PWE3-ETH]. Following 
        rules are observed when processing ARP packets, 
          a. Both broadcast (request) and unicast (response) ARP 
             packets are sent over the 'multicast' pseudowire. 
          b. When an ARP packet is received from an AC, the packet is 
             copied to control plane for learning MAC address of the 
             CE. Optionally, IP address is also learned to record the 
             association of IP and MAC address. 
          c. All Ethernet packets, including ARP packets, received from 
             'multicast' pseudowire are forwarded out to all the ACs 
             associated with the IPLS instance. These packets are not 
             copied to control plane.
    
     6. ICMP IPv6 ND/IND related Packet Forwarding: (Inverse) Neighbor 
        Discovery (ND/IND) IPv6 packets from an AC are replicated and a 
        copy is sent to other ACs and to 'multicast' PWs associated 
        with the IPLS instance in the native Ethernet format, 
        unchanged. A copy is also submitted to Control Plane to learn 
        the MAC address and optionally corresponding IPv6 addresses. 
          
     7. Multicast IP packet forwarding: An IP Ethernet frame received 
        from an AC is replicated to other ACs and the 'multicast' 
        pseudowires associated with the IPLS instance. An IP Ethernet 
        frame received from a 'multicast' pseudowire is replicated to 
        all the egress ACs associated with the IPLS instance. 
         
     8. Unicast IP packet forwarding: An IP packet received from the AC 
        is forwarded based on the MAC DA lookup in the forwarding 
        table. If a match is found, the packet is forwarded to the 
        associated egress interface. If the egress interface is unicast 
        pseudowire, the packet is sent without MAC header. If the 
        egress interface is a local AC the Ethernet frame is forwarded 
        as such. An IP packet received from the unicast pseudowire is 
        forwarded to egress AC with MAC header prepended. The MAC DA is 
        derived from the forwarding table while MAC SA is the MAC 
        address of the PE.

   Both VPLS [VPLS] and IPLS require the ingress PE to forward a frame 
   based on its destination MAC address. However, two key differences 
   between VPLS and IPLS can be noted from the above description: 
    
     . In VPLS, MAC entries are placed in the FIB of the ingress PE as 
        a result of MAC address learning (which occurs in the data 
        plane) while in IPLS MAC entries are placed in the FIB as a 
        result of pseudowire signaling operations (control plane). 
     . In VPLS, the egress PE looks up a frame's destination MAC 
        address to determine the egress AC; in IPLS, the egress AC is 
        determined entirely by the ingress PW-label. 
    
   The following sections describe the details of the IPLS scheme. 
    
2.1 Terminology 
    
    
        IPLS           IP-only LAN service (a type of Virtual Private 
                       LAN Service that is restricted to IP traffic 
                       only).  
    
        mp2p PW        Multipoint-to-Point Pseudowire. A pseudowire 
                       that carries traffic from remote PE devices to 
                       a PE device that signals the pseudowire. The 
                       signaling PE device advertises the same PW-
                       label to all remote PE devices that participate 
                       in the IPLS service instance. In IPLS, for a 
                       given IPLS instance, an mp2p PW used for IP 
                       unicast traffic is established by a PE for each 
                       CE device locally attached to that PE. It is a 
                       unidirectional tree whose leaves consist of the 
                       remote PE peers (which connect at least one AC 
                       associated with the same IPLS instance) and 
                       whose root is the signaling PE. Traffic flows 
                       from the leaves towards the root.  
         
        Multicast PW   Multicast/broadcast Pseudowire. A special kind 
                       of mp2p PW that carries IP multicast/broadcast 
                       traffic, all ARP frames and ICMP (I)ND frames 
                       for IPv6. In the IPLS architecture, for each 
                       IPLS instance supported by a PE, that PE device 
                       establishes exactly one multicast PW. Multicast 
                       PW uses Ethernet encapsulation. 
         
        Unicast PW     Unicast Pseudowire carries IP unicast packets. 
                       A PE creates unicast PW for each locally 
                       attached CE. The unicast PW uses IP Layer2 
                       transport encapsulation.

        CE             Customer Edge device. In this document, a CE is 
                       any IP node (host or router) connected to the 
                       IPLS LAN service.  
         
        Replication Tree The collection of all multicast PWs and ACs 
                        that are members of an IPLS service instance on 
                        a given PE. When a PE receives a 
                        multicast/broadcast packet from an AC, the PE 
                        device sends a copy of the packet to every 
                        multicast pseudowire and AC of the replication 
                        tree, excluding the AC on which the packet was 
                        received. When a PE receives a packet from a 
                        multicast PW, the PE device sends a copy of the 
                        packet to all the ACs of the replication tree 
                        and never to other PWs.

3.0 Topology 
    
   The Customer Edge (CE) devices are IP nodes (hosts or routers) that 
   are connected to PE devices either directly, or via an Ethernet 
   network. We assume that the PE/CE connection may be regarded by the 
   PE as an "interface" to which one or more CEs are attached.  This 
   interface may be a physical LAN interface or a VLAN.  The Provider 
   Edge (PE) routers are MPLS Label Edge Routers (LERs) that serve as 
   pseudowire endpoints.

   In the above diagram, an IPLS instance is shown with three sites: 
   site S1, site S2 and site S3. In site S3, the CE device is directly 
   connected to its PE.  In the other two sites, there are multiple CEs 
   connected to a single PE. More precisely, the CEs at these sites are 
   on an Ethernet (switched at site 1 and shared at site 2) network (or 
   VLAN), and the PE is attached to that same Ethernet network or 
   VLAN).  We impose the following restriction:  if one or more CEs 
   attach to a PE by virtue of being on a common LAN or VLAN, there 
   MUST NOT be more than one PE on that LAN or VLAN.   
    
   PE1, PE2 and PE3 are shown as connected via an MPLS network; 
   however, other tunneling technologies, such as GRE, L2TPv3, etc., 
   could also be used to carry the pseudowires.  
    
   An IPLS instance is a single broadcast domain, such that each IP end 
   station (e.g., IPa) appears to be co-located with other IP end 
   stations (e.g., IPb through IPf) on the same subnet. The IPLS 
   service is transparent to the CE devices and requires no changes to 
   them. 
    
4.0 Configuration 
    
   Each PE router is configured with one or more IPLS service 
   instances, and each IPLS service instance is associated with a 
   unique VPN-Id. For a given IPLS service instance, a set of ACs is 
   identified. Each AC can be associated with only one IPLS instance. 
   An AC, in this document, is either a customer-facing Ethernet port, 
   or a particular VLAN (identified by an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN ID) on a 
   customer-facing Ethernet port. 
    
   The PE router can optionally be configured with a local MAC address    
   to be used as source MAC address when IP packets are forwarded from

   a pseudowire to an AC. By default, a PE uses the MAC address of the 
   customer-facing Ethernet interface for this purpose.  
    
5.0 Discovery 
 
   The discovery process includes: 
     . Remote PE discovery 
     . VPN (i.e., IPLS) membership discovery 
     . IP CE end station discovery 
    
   This draft does not discuss the remote PE discovery or VPN 
   membership discovery. This information can either be user configured 
   or can be obtained using auto-discovery techniques described in 
   [L2VPN-SIG] or other methods. However, the discovery of the CE is an 
   important operational step in the IPLS model and is described below. 
 
5.1 CE discovery 
    
   Each PE actively detects the presence of local CEs by snooping IP 
   and ARP frames received over the ACs. When an AC configured in an 
   IPLS instance becomes operational, it enters the CE discovery phase. 
   In this phase, the PE examines each multicast/broadcast Ethernet 
   frame. For link-local IP frames (for example IGP 
   discovery/multicast/broadcast packets typically 224.0.0.x addresses 
   [RFC-1112]), the CE's (source) MAC address is extracted from the 
   Ethernet header and the (source) IP address is obtained from the IP 
   header.  
    
   For each CE, the PE maintains the following tuple: <Attachment 
   Circuit identification info, VPN-Id, MAC address, IP address 
   (optional)>. 
    
    
 5.1.1 IPv4 based CE discovery 
    
   As indicated earlier, a copy of ARP frames received over the AC is 
   submitted to the control plane. The PE learns MAC address and 
   optionally IP address of the CE from the source address fields of 
   the ARP PDU. 
    
   Once a CE is discovered, its status is monitored continuously by 
   examining the received ARP frames and by periodically generating ARP 
   requests. The absence of an ARP response from a CE after a 
   configurable number of ARP requests is interpreted as loss of 
   connectivity with the CE. 
    
    
 5.1.2 Ipv6 based CE discovery [RFC 2461] 
    
   A copy of Neighbor and Router Discovery frames received over the AC 
   are submitted to the control plane in the PE.  
   Shah, et al.          Expires January 2013                    Page 10 
    
    
   Internet Draft    draft-ietf-l2vpn-ipls-11.txt 
                                    
    
    
   If the PE receives a Neighbor Solicitation message, and the source 
   IP address of the message is not the unspecified address, the PE 
   learns the MAC address and optionally IP address of the CE.  
    
   If the PE receives an unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement message, 
   the PE learns the source MAC address and optionally the IP address 
   of the CE. 
    
   If the PE receives a Router Solicitation, and the source IP address 
   of the message is not the unspecified address, the PE learns source 
   MAC address and optionally the IP address of the CE. 
    
   If the PE receives a Router Advertisement, it learns source MAC 
   address and optionally the IP address of the CE. 
    
   The PE will periodically generate Neighbor Solicitation messages for 
   the IP address of the CE as a means of verifying the continued 
   existence of the address and its MAC address binding. The absence of 
   a response from the CE device for a given number of retries could be 
   interpreted as a loss of connectivity with the CE. 
    
    
6.0 Pseudowire Creation 
 
6.1 Receive Unicast Multipoint-to-point Pseudowire 
    
   As the PE discovers each locally attached CE, a unicast multipoint-
   to-point pseudowire (mp2p PW) associated exclusively with that CE is 
   created by distributing the MAC address and optionally IP address of 
   the CE along with a PW-Label to all the remote PE peers that 
   participate in the same IPLS instance. Note that the same value of a 
   PW-label SHOULD be distributed to all the remote PE peers for a 
   given CE. The mp2p PW thus created is used by remote PEs to send 
   unicast IP traffic to a specific CE.  
    
   (The same functionality can be provided by a set of point-to-point 
   PWs, and the PE is not required to send the same PW-label to all the 
   other PEs.  For convenience, however, we will use the term mp2p PWs, 
   which may be implemented using a set of point-to-point PWs.) 
                                                           
   The PE forwards a frame received over this mp2p PW to the associated 
   AC. 
    
   The unicast pseudowire uses IP Layer2 Transport encapsulation as 
   define in [PWE3-CONTROL]. 
    
6.2 Receive Multicast Multipoint-to-point Pseudowire 
    
   When a PE is configured to participate in an IPLS instance, it 
   advertises a 'multicast' PW-label to every other PE that is a member 
   Shah, et al.          Expires January 2013                    Page 11 
    
    
   Internet Draft    draft-ietf-l2vpn-ipls-11.txt 
                                    
    
   of the same IPLS. The advertised PW-label value is the same for each 
   PE, which creates an mp2p pseudowire. There is only one such 
   multicast mp2p PW per PE for each IPLS instance and this pseudowire 
   is used exclusively to carry IP multicast/broadcast, ARP traffic and 
   (inverse) Neighbor Discovery packets for IPv6 from the remote PEs to 
   this PE for this IPLS instance. 
    
   Note that no special functionality is expected from this pseudowire.  
   We call it a 'multicast' pseudowire because we use it to carry 
   multicast and broadcast IP, ARP and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery traffic.  
   The pseudowire itself need not provide any different service than 
   any of the unicast pseudowires. 
    
   In particular, the Receive multicast mp2p PW does not perform any 
   replication of frames itself. Rather, it is there to signify to the 
   PE that the PE may need to replicate a copy of a frame received over 
   this mp2p PW onto all the AC that are associated with the IPLS 
   instance of the mp2p PW. 
    
   The multicast mp2p pseudowire is considered the principle pseudowire 
   in the bundle of mp2p pseudowires that consist of one multicast mp2p 
   pseudowire and a variable number of unicast mp2p pseudowires for a 
   given IPLS instance. In a principle role, multicast PW represents 
   the IPLS instance. The life of all unicast PWs in the IPLS instance 
   depends on the existence of the multicast PW. If, for some reasons, 
   multicast PW cease to exist, all the associated unicast pseudowires 
   in the bundle are removed. 
    
   The multicast pseudowire uses Ethernet encapsulation as defined in 
   [PWE3-ETH].  
     
   The use of pseudowires which are specially optimized for multicast 
   is for further study. 
    
6.3 Send Multicast Replication tree 
    
   The PE creates a send replication tree for each IPLS instance, which 
   consists of the collection of all ACs and all the 'multicast' 
   pseudowires of the IPLS instance. 
    
   Any ARP, Neighbor Discovery or multicast IP Ethernet frame received 
   over an AC is replicated to the other ACs and to the mp2p multicast 
   pseudowire of the send replication tree. The send replication tree 
   deals mostly with broadcast/multicast Ethernet MAC frames. One 
   exception to this is unicast ARP and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery frame, 
   the processing of which is described in the following section.  
    
   Any Ethernet frame received over the multicast PW is replicated to 
   all the ACs of the send replication tree of the IPLS instance 
   associated with the incoming PW label. One exception is unicast ARP

   and Neighbor Discovery frame used for IPv6, the processing of which 
   is described in the following section. 
    
7.0 Signaling 
    
   [PWE3-CONTROL] uses the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) to 
   exchange PW-FECs in the Label Mapping message in a downstream 
   unsolicited mode. The PW-FEC comes in two forms; PWid and 
   Generalized PWid FEC elements. These FEC elements define some fields 
   that are common between them. The discussions below refer to these 
   common fields for IPLS related extensions. Note that the use of 
   multipoint to point and unidirectional characteristics of the PW 
   makes BGP as the ideal candidate for PW-FEC signaling. The use of 
   BGP for such purposes is for future study.  
    
7.1 IPLS PW Signaling 
   
   An IPLS carries IP packets as payload over its unicast pseudowires 
   and Ethernet packet as payload over its multicast pseudowire. The 
   PW-type to be used for unicast pseudowire is the IP PW, defined in 
   [PWE3-CONTROL] as IP Layer2 Transport. The PW-type to be used for 
   multicast pseudowire is the Ethernet PW as defined in [PWE3-ETH]. 
   The PW-Type values for these encapsulations are defined in [PWE3-
   IANA]. 
        
   When processing a received PW FEC, the PE matches the PW Id with the 
   locally configured PW Id for the IPLS instance. If the PW type is 
   Ethernet, the PW-FEC is for multicast PW. If the PW type is 'IP 
   Layer2 transport', the PW FEC is for unicast PW.  
    
   For unicast PW, PE must check the presence of MAC address TLV in the 
   optional parameter fields of the Label Mapping message. If this 
   parameter is absent, a Label Release message must be issued with a 
   Status Code meaning "MAC Address of the CE is absent" [note: Status 
   Code 0x0000004C is pending IANA allocation], to reject the 
   establishment of the unicast PW with the remote PE. 
    
   The PE may optionally include IP address TLV based on the user 
   configuration for advertising of the IP addresses of the local CE. 
    
   The processing of the address list TLV is as follows. 
    
     o  If a pseudowire is configured for AC with IPv4 CEs only, the 
        PE should advertise address list tlv with address family type 
        to be of IPv4 address. The PE should process the IPv4 address 
        list TLV as described in this document.  
     o  If a pseudowire is configured for AC with both IPv4 and IPv6 
        CEs, the PE should advertise IPv6 capability using the 
        procedures described in Section below.   
   Shah, et al.          Expires January 2013                    Page 13 
    
    
   Internet Draft    draft-ietf-l2vpn-ipls-11.txt 
                                    
    
     o  If a PE does not receive any IP address list TLV or IPv6 
        capability advertisement, it MAY assume IPv4 behavior.  
    
   The IPLS uses the Address List TLV as defined in [RFC 3036] to 
   signal the MAC (and optionally IP) address of the local CE. There 
   are two TLVs defined below; IP Address TLV and MAC Address TLV. MAC 
   address TLV must be included in the optional parameter field of the 
   Label Mapping message when establishing the unicast IP PW for IPLS. 
    
   When configured to support specific type of IP traffic (IPv4 or 
   IPv6), the PE augments verification of the type of traffic PW will 
   carry using the Address Family Type value. If there is a mismatch 
   between the received Address Family value and the expectation of 
   IPLS instance to which the PW belongs, the PE must issue a Label 
   Release message with a Status Code meaning "IP Address type 
   mismatch" (Status Code 0x0000004A) to reject the PW establishment. 
    
   Encoding of the IP Address TLV is: 
     
       0                   1                   2                   3

   The IPv4 address of the CE is also supplied in the optional

   FEC. The LDP Notification message is used to signal any change in 
   the status of the CE's IPv4 address.  
    
   Note that Notification message does not apply to MAC address TLV 
   since an update to MAC address of the CE should result in label 
   withdraw followed by establishment of new PW with new MAC address of 
   the CE. However, advertisement of IP address(es) of the CE is 
   optional and changes may become known after the establishment of

   The Status TLV status code is set to 0x0000002C "IP address of CE", 
   to indicate that IP Address update follows. Since this notification 
   does not refer to any particular message the Message Id, and Message 
   Type fields are set to 0.
    
   The PW FEC TLV SHOULD not include the interface parameters as they 
   are ignored in the context of this message.   
    
     
7.2 IPv6 Capability Advertisement 
    
   A 'Stack Capability' Interface Parameter sub-TLV is signaled by the 
   two PEs so that they can agree which stack(s) they should be using. 
   It is assumed by default that the IP PW will always be capable of 
   carrying IPv4 packets. Thus this capability sub-TLV is used to 
   indicate if other stacks need to be supported concurrently with 
   IPv4.  
    
   The 'Stack Capability' sub-TLV is part of the interface parameters 
   of the PW FEC. The proposed format for the Stack Capability 
   interface parameter sub-TLV is as follows: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Parameter ID = 0x16 
    
   Length = 4 
    
   Stack capability = 0x0001 to indicate IPv6 stack capability

   The Value of Stack capability is dependent on the PW type context. 
   For IP PW type, a setting of 0x0001 indicates IPv6 stack capability. 
    
   A PE that supports IPv6 on an IP PW MUST signal the stack capability 
   sub-TLV in the initial label mapping message for the PW. The PE 
   nodes compare the value advertised by the remote PE with the local 
   configuration and only use a capability which is advertised by both. 
   If a PE that supports IPv6 does not receive a 'stack capability' 
   sub-TLV from the far-end PE in the initial label mapping message, or 
   one is received but it is set to a reserved value, the PE MUST send 
   an unsolicited release for the PW label with the LDP status code 
   meaning "IP Address type mismatch" (Status Code 0x0000004A).  
    
   The behavior of a PE that does not understand an interface parameter 
   sub-TLV is specified in RFC4447 [RFC4447]. 
    
 
7.3 Signaling Advertisement Processing 
    
   A PE should process a received [PWE3-CONTROL] advertisement with PW-
   type of IP Layer2 transport for IPLS as follows, 
        - Verify the IPLS VPN membership by matching the VPN-Id 
          signaled in the AGI field or the PW-ID field with all the 
          VPN-Ids configured in the PE. Discard and release the PW 
          label if VPN-Id is not found. 
        - Program the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) such that when 
          a unicast IP packet is received from an AC with its 
          destination MAC address matching the advertised MAC address, 
          the packet is forwarded out over the tunnel to the 
          advertising PE with the advertised PW-label as the inner 
          label. 
    
   A PE should process a received [PWE3-CONTROL] advertisement with the 
   PW type of Ethernet for IPLS as follows, 
        - Verify the IPLS VPN membership by matching the VPN-Id 
          signaled in the AGI field or the PW-ID field with all the 
          VPN-Ids configured in the PE. Discard and release the PW 
          label if VPN-Id is not found.  
        - Add the PW-label to the send broadcast replication tree for 
          the VPN-Id. This enables sending a copy of a 
          multicast/broadcast IP Ethernet frame or ARP Ethernet frame 
          or Neighbor Discovery frames from the AC to this pseudowire.

8. IANA Considerations    
    
8.1. LDP Status messages  
    
   This document uses new LDP status code. IANA already maintains a 
   registry of name "STATUS CODE NAME SPACE" defined by [RFC 3036]. The     
   following value is suggested for assignment:  
         
             0x0000002C "IP Address of CE" 
             0x0000004A "IP Address Type Mismatch" 
             0x0000004C "MAC Address of CE is absent"  
    
    
8.2. Interface Parameters 
    
   This document proposes a new Interface Parameters sub-TLV, to be 
   assigned from the 'Pseudowire Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type 
   Registry'. The following value is suggested for the Parameter ID: 
    
   0x16 "Stack capability" 
    
   IANA is also requested to set up a registry of "L2VPN PE stack 
   capabilities". This is a 16 bit field. Stack capability values 
   0x0001 is specified in Section 7.  of this document.  The remaining 
   bitfield values (0x0002,..,0x8000) are to be assigned by IANA using 
   the "IETF Consensus" policy defined in [RFC2434].

9.0 Forwarding  
    
9.1 Non-IP or non-ARP traffic 
    
   In an IPLS VPN, a PE forwards only IP and ARP traffic. All other 
   frames are dropped silently.  If the CEs must pass non-IP traffic to 
   each other, they must do so through IP tunnels that terminate at the 
   CEs themselves.

   Internet Draft    draft-ietf-l2vpn-ipls-11.txt 
                                    
    
 
9.2 Unicast IP Traffic 
    
   In IPLS, IP traffic is forwarded from the AC to the PW based on the 
   destination MAC address of the layer 2 frame (and not based on the 
   IP Header). 
 
   The PE identifies the FIB associated with an IPLS instance based on 
   the AC or the PW label. When a frame is received from an AC, the PE 
   uses the destination MAC address as the lookup key. When a frame is 
   received from a PW, the PE uses the PW-Label as the lookup key. The 
   frame is dropped if the lookup fails. 
    
   For IPv6 support, the unicast IP ICMP frame of Neighbor Discovery 
   Protocol [RFC 2461] is bi-casted; one copy is submitted to the 
   control plane and other copy to the PW, based on the destination MAC 
   address.   
    
9.3 Broadcasts and Multicast IP Traffic 
    
   When the destination MAC address is either a broadcast or multicast, 
   a copy of the frame is sent to the control plane for CE discovery 
   purposes (see section 5.1). It is important to note that the frames 
   sent to the control plane is applied stricter rate limiting criteria 
   to avoid overwhelming the control plane under adverse conditions 
   such as Denial Of Service attack. The service provider should also 
   provide a configurable limitation to prevent overflowing of the 
   learned source addresses in a given IPLS instance. Also, a caution 
   must be used such that only link local multicasts and broadcast IP 
   packets are sent to control plane. 
    
   When a multicast/broadcast IP packet is received from an AC, the PE 
   replicates it onto the Send Multicast Replication Tree (See section 
   6.3). When a multicast/broadcast IP Ethernet frame is received from 
   a pseudowire, the PE forwards a copy of the frame to all the ACs 
   associated with the respective IPLS VPN instance. Note that 
   'multicast' PW uses Ethernet encapsulation and hence does not 
   require additional header manipulations. 
 
9.4 ARP Traffic 
    
   When a broadcast ARP frame is received over the AC, a copy of the 
   frame is sent to the control plane for CE discovery purposes. The PE 
   replicates the frame onto the Send Multicast Replication Tree (see 
   section 6.3), which results into a copy to be delivered to all the 
   remote PEs on the 'multicast' PW and other local CEs through the 
   egress ACs. 
    
   When a broadcast Ethernet ARP frame is received over the 'multicast' 
   PW, a copy of the Ethernet ARP frame is sent to all the ACs 
   associated with the IPLS instance.

   Internet Draft    draft-ietf-l2vpn-ipls-11.txt 
                                    
    
    
   When a unicast Ethernet ARP frame is received over the AC, a copy of 
   the frame is sent to the control plane for the CE discovery 
   purposes. The PE may optionally do MAC DA lookup in the forwarding 
   table and send the ARP frame to a specific egress interface (AC or 
   'multicast' PW to a remote PE) or replicate the frame onto the Send 
   Multicast Replication Tree (see section 6.3). 
    
   When a unicast ARP Ethernet frame is received over the 'multicast' 
   PW, PE may optionally do MAC DA lookup in the forwarding table and 
   forward it to the AC where the CE is located. If the CE is not 
   accessible through any local AC, the frame is dropped. Conversely, 
   the PE may simply forward the frame to all the ACs associated with 
   that IPLS instance without any lookup in the forwarding table. 
    
9.5 Discovery of IPv6 CE devices 
    
   A PE device that supports IPv6 MUST be capable of, 
    
   -  Intercepting ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC 2461] packets 
      received over the AC. 
   -  Record the IPv6 interface addresses and CE link-layer addresses 
      present in these packets 
   -  Forward them towards the original destination 
   A PE device may also intercept Router Discovery packets in order to 
   discover the link layer address and IPv6 interface address(es) of 
   the CE. Following sections describe the details.  
    
   The PE device MUST learn the link-layer address of the local CE and 
   be able to use it when forwarding traffic between CEs. The PE MAY 
   also wish to monitor the source link-layer address of data packets 
   received from the CE, and discard packets not matching its learned 
   CE link-layer address. The PE device may also optionally learn a 
   list of CE IPv6 interface addresses for its directly-attached CE. 
    
    
9.5.1. Processing of Neighbor Solicitations 
    
   When a broadcast Neighbor Solicitation frame is received over the 
   AC, a copy of the frame is sent to the control plane for CE 
   discovery purposes. The PE replicates the frame onto the Send 
   Multicast Replication Tree (see section 6.3), which results into a 
   copy to be delivered to all the remote PEs on the 'multicast' PW and 
   other local CEs through the egress ACs. The PE may optionally learn 
   an IPv6 interface address (If provided - this will not be the case 
   for Duplicate Address Detection) when present.

   When a broadcast Ethernet Neighbor Solicitation frame is received 
   over the 'multicast' PW, a copy is sent to all the ACs associated 
   with the IPLS instance. 
    
9.5.2 Processing of Neighbor Advertisements 
    
   When a unicast Neighbor Advertisement is received over the AC, a 
   copy of the frame is sent to the control plane for the CE discovery 
   purposes. The PE may optionally do MAC DA lookup in the forwarding 
   table and send the Neighbor Advertisement frame to a specific egress 
   interface (AC or 'multicast' PW to a remote PE) or replicate the 
   frame onto the Send Multicast Replication Tree (see section 6.3). 
    
   Optionally, PE could learn the IPv6 Interface address of the CE. 
    
   When a unicast Neighbor Advertisement frame is received over the 
   'multicast' PW, PE may optionally do MAC DA lookup in the forwarding 
   table and forward it to the AC where the CE is located. If the CE is 
   not accessible through any local AC, the frame is dropped. 
   Conversely, the PE may simply forward the frame to all the ACs 
   associated with that IPLS instance without any lookup in the 
   forwarding table. 
    
9.5.3 Processing of Inverse Neighbor Solicitations and Advertisement 
    
   Inverse Neighbor Discovery is typically used on non-broadcast links, 
   but are allowed on broadcast links too [3122]. PE may optionally 
   intercept Inverse Neighbor Solicitation and Advertisement and learn 
   MAC and IPv6 interface address list of the attached CE from the copy 
   of the frame sent to the control plane. The PE may optionally do MAC 
   DA lookup in the forwarding table and send another copy of the frame 
   to a specific egress interface (AC or 'multicast' PW to a remote PE) 
   or replicate the frame onto the Send Multicast Replication Tree (see 
   section 6.3).  
    
9.5.4 Processing of Router Solicitations and Advertisements 
    
   Router Solicitations (RS) are multicast while Router Advertisement 
   (RA) can be unicast or multicast Ethernet frames. The PE could 
   optionally intercept RS and RA frames and send a copy to control 
   plane. The PE may learn the MAC address and a list of interface 
   addresses for the attached CE.  
    
   For unicast RA, the PE may optionally do MAC DA lookup in the 
   forwarding table and send the Neighbor Advertisement frame to a 
   specific egress interface (AC or 'multicast' PW to a remote PE) or 
   replicate the frame onto the Send Multicast Replication Tree (see 
   section 6.3). The multicast RA and RS Ethernet frames are replicated 
   to using the Send Multicast Replication Tree as described in section 
   6.3.

9.6 Encapsulation 
    
   The Ethernet MAC header of a unicast IP packet received from an AC  
   is stripped before forwarding the frame to the unicast pseudowire. 
   However, the MAC header is retained for the following cases, 
     . when a frame is unicast or broadcast IP packet that is directed 
        to one or more local AC(s).  
     . when a frame is a broadcast IP packet 
     . when a frame is an ARP packet  
     . when a frame is Neighbor/Router Solicitation/Advertisement  
      
   An IP frame received over a unicast pseudowire is prepended with a 
   MAC header before transmitting it on the appropriate ACs). The 
   fields in the MAC header are filled in as follows:  
        - The destination MAC address is the MAC address associated 
          with the PW label in the FIB 
        - The source MAC address is the PE's own local MAC address or a 
          MAC address which has been specially configured on the PE for 
          this use. 
        - The Ethernet Type field is 0x0800 if IPv4 or 0x86DD if IPv6 
          [RFC 2464] 
        - The frame may be IEEE802.1Q tagged based on the VLAN 
          information associated with the AC. 
    
   An FCS is appended to the frame. 
    
10.0   Attaching to IPLS via ATM or FR 
 
   In addition to (i) an Ethernet port and a (ii) combination of 
   Ethernet port and a VLAN ID, an AC to IPLS may also be (iii) an ATM 
   or FR VC carrying encapsulated bridged Ethernet frames or (iv) the 
   combination of an ATM or FR VC and a VLAN ID. 
    
   The ATM/FR VC is just used as a way to transport Ethernet frames 
   between a customer site and the PE. The PE terminates the ATM/FR VC 
   and operates on the encapsulated Ethernet frames exactly as if those 
   were received on a local Ethernet interface. When a frame is 
   propagated from pseudowire to a ATM or FR VC the PE prepends the 
   Ethernet frame with the appropriate bridged encapsulation header as 
   defined in [RFC 2684] and [RFC 2427] respectively. Operation of an 
   IPLS over ATM/FR VC is exactly as described above, with the 
   exception that the AC is then identified via the ATM VCI/VPI or 
   Frame Relay DLCI (instead of via a local Ethernet port ID), or a 
   combination of those with a VLAN ID. 
    
11.0 VPLS vs IPLS 
    
   The VPLS approach proposed in [VPLS] provides VPN services for IP as 
   well as other protocols. The IPLS approach described in this draft 
   is similar to VPLS in many respects: 
   Shah, et al.          Expires January 2013                    Page 23 
    
    
   Internet Draft    draft-ietf-l2vpn-ipls-11.txt 
                                    
    
        - It provides a Provider Provisioned Virtual LAN service with 
          multipoint capability where a CE connected via a single 
          attachment circuit can reach many remote CEs 
        - It appears as a broadcast domain and a single subnet 
        - forwarding is based on destination MAC addresses 
         
   However, unlike VPLS, IPLS is restricted to IP traffic only. By 
   restricting the scope of the service to the predominant type of 
   traffic in today's environment, IPLS eliminates the need for service 
   provider edge routers to implement some bridging functions such as 
   MAC address learning in the data path (by, instead, distributing MAC 
   information in the control plane). Thus this solution offers a 
   number of benefits: 
    
        - Facilitates Virtual LAN services in instances where PE 
          devices cannot or cannot efficiently (or are specifically 
          configured not to) perform MAC address learning.  
        - Unknown Unicast frames are never flooded as would be the case 
          in VPLS. 
        - Encapsulation is more efficient (MAC header is stripped) for 
          unicast IP packets while traversing the backbone network. 
        - PE devices are not burdened with the processing overhead 
          associated with traditional bridging (e.g., STP processing, 
          etc.). Note however that some of these overheads (e.g., STP 
          processing) could optionally be turned-off with a VPLS 
          solution in the case where it is known that only IP devices 
          are interconnected. 
        - Loops (perhaps through backdoor links) are minimized since a 
          PE could easily reject (via label release) a duplicate IP to 
          MAC address advertisement. 
        - Greater control over CE topology distribution. 
    
12.0 IP Protocols 
    
   The solution described in this document offers IPLS service for IPv4 
   and IPv6 traffic only. For this reason, the MAC Header is not 
   carried over the unicast pseudowire. It is reconstructed by the PE 
   when receiving a packet from a unicast pseudowire and the Ethertype 
   0x0800 or 0x86DD is used in the MAC Header since IPv4 or IPv6 
   respectively, is assumed. 
 
   However, this solution may be extended to carry other types of 
   important traffic such as ISIS , which does not use Ethernet-II, 
   EtherType based header. In order to permit the propagation of such 
   packets correctly, one may create a separate set of pseudowires, or 
   pass protocol information in the "control word" of a "multiprotocol" 
   pseudowire, or encapsulate the Ethernet MAC Header in the 
   pseudowire. The selection of appropriate multiplexing/demultiplexing 
   scheme is the subject of future study. The current document focuses 
   on IPLS service for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

13.0 Dual Homing with IPLS 
    
   As stated in previous sections, IPLS prohibits connection of a 
   common LAN or VLAN to more than one PE. Alternatively the CE device 
   itself can connect to more than one instance of IPLS through two 
   separate LAN or VLAN connections to separate PEs. To the CE IP 
   device, these separate connections appear as connections to two IP 
   subnets. The failure of reachability through one subnet is then 
   resolved via the other subnet using IP routing protocols. 
    
14.0 Proxy ARP function 
     
   The earlier version of this proposal used IP-PW to carry both the 
   broadcast/multicast and unicast IP traffic. It also discussed how PE 
   proxy functionality responds to the ARP requests of the local CE on 
   behalf of remote CE. The current version of the draft eliminated 
   these functions and instead uses Ethernet PW to carry broadcast, 
   multicast and ARP frames to remote PEs. The motivation to use 
   Ethernet PW and propagate ARP frames in the current version is to 
   support configuration like back-to-back IPLS (similar to Inter 
   AS option-A configurations in [RFC 4364]). 
     
   The termination and controlled propagation of ARP frames is still a 
   desirable option for security, DoS and other purposes. For these 
   reasons, we re-introduce the ARP Proxy [PROXY-ARP] function in this 
   revision as an optional feature. Following sections describe this 
   option. 
     
14.1 ARP Proxy - Responder 
   
   As a local configuration, a PE can enable ARP Proxy responder 
   function. In this mode, local PE responds to ARP requests received 
   over the Attachment Circuit via learnt IP and MAC address 
   associations, which are advertised by the remote PEs. In addition, 
   PE may utilize local policies to determine if ARP requests should be 
   responded based on the source of the ARP request, rate at which the 
   ARP requests are generated, etc. In nutshell, when this feature is 
   enabled, ARP requests are not propagated to remote PE routers that 
   are members of the same IPLS instance. 
     
14.2 ARP Proxy - Generator 
     
   As a local configuration, a PE can enable ARP Proxy generator 
   function. In this mode, the PE generates ARP request for each IP and 
   MAC address associations received from the remote PEs. The remote 
   CE's IP and MAC address is used as the source information in the ARP 
   request while the destination IP address in the request is obtained 
   from the local configuration (that is, user needs to configure an IP 
   address when this feature is enabled). The ARP request is sent on

   the Attachment Circuits that have ARP Proxy Generator enabled and is 
   associated with the given IPLS instance. 
    
   In addition, the PE may utilize local policies to determine which 
   IP/MAC addresses are candidate for ARP request generation. 
     
   The ARP Proxy Generator feature is required to support back-to-back 
   IPLS configuration when any member of the IPLS instance is using ARP 
   Proxy Responder function. An example of a back-to-back IPLS is a 
   configuration where PE-1 (ASBR) in an IPLS cloud in one Autonomous 
   System (say, AS-1) is connected via an Attachment Circuit to another 
   PE-2 (ASBR) in an IPLS cloud in another Autonomous System (say, AS-
   2) where each PE appears as CE to each other. Such configuration is 
   described in [RFC 4364] as option-A for inter-AS connectivity. The 
   Proxy ARP responder feature prevents propagation of ARP requests to 
   PE-1 (ASBR) in AS-1. This necessitates that PE-1 (ASBR) in AS-1 
   generate ARP request on behalf of each CE connected to the IPLS 
   instance in AS-1 as a mean to 'advertise' the reachability to IPLS 
   cloud in AS-2 
    
15.0 Data Center Applicability
   
   The resurgence of interest in providing IP/MPLS based solution for 
   Data Center Networks (DCN) deserves another look at the IPLS 
   methodologies described in this document. The key requirement of
   DCN to permit VM mobility within or across DCN necessiates 
   extending the reachability of IP subnet over a LAN, transparently.
   In addition, VMs tendancy to generate frequent gratutious ARPs 
   for location discovery necessiates a solution that curbs broadcasts
   closest to the source.

   The IPLS solution facilitates VM mobility by way of PE closest to 
   the new location signaling the MAC address to all remote peers.
   In addition, control-plane based MAC learning mechanisms prevent
   flooding of unknown unicast across DCN. The optional ARP proxy
   mechanisms further reduces ARP broadcast floods by preventing
   its reach across local PE.

17.0 Security Considerations 
    
   A more comprehensive description of the security issues involved in 
   L2VPNs are covered in [VPN-SEC]. Most of the security issues can be 
   avoided through implementation of appropriate guards. The security 
   aspect of this solution is addressed for two planes; control plane 
   and data plane.   
    
17.1 Control plane security  
         
   The control plane security pertains to establishing the LDP   
   connection, pseudo-wire establishment and CE's IP and MAC address    
   distribution. The LDP connection between two trusted PEs can be     
   achieved by each PE verifying the incoming connection against the    
   configured peer's address and authenticating the LDP messages using    
   MD5 authentication. The pseudo-wire establishments between two     
   secure LDP peers do not pose security issue but mis-wiring could 
   occur due to configuration error. Some checks, such as, proper    
   pseudo-wire type and other pseudo-wire options may prevent mis-    
   wiring due to configuration errors.  
         
   The learning of the appropriate CE's IP and MAC address can be a 
   security issue. It is expected that the local attachment circuit to 
   CE be physically secured. If this is a concern, the PE must be 
   configured with CE's IP and MAC address. During each ARP frame 
   processing, PE must verify the received information against the 
   configuration before accepting. This prevents theft of service, 
   denial of service to a subscriber or DoS attacks to all subscribers 
   by malicious use of network services. 
    
   The IPLS also provides MAC anti spoofing by preventing the use of 
   already known MAC address. For instance, if a PE has already learned 
   a presence of a CE through local connection or from another PE, and 
   subsequently an advertisement for the same MAC and/or IP address is 
   received from a different PE, the receiving PE can terminate service 
   to that CE (either through label release and/or removing the ARP 
   entry from the FIB) and raise the alarm. 
    
   The IPLS learns and distributes CE reachability through the control 
   plane. This provides greater control over CE topology distribution 
   through application of local policies.  
        
17.2 Data plane security  
         
   The data traffic between CE and PE is not encrypted and it is     
   possible that in an insecure environment, a malicious user may tap     
   into the CE to PE connection and generate traffic using the spoofed    
   destination MAC address on the Ethernet Attachment Circuit. In     
   order to avoid such hijacking, local PE may verify the source MAC     
   address of the received frame against the MAC address of the 
   admitted connection. The frame is forwarded to PW only when   
   authenticity is verified. When spoofing is detected, PE must severe     
   the connection with the local CE, tear down the PW and start over. 
    
   Each IPLS instance uses its own FIB. This prevents leaking of one 
   customer data into another.

Abstract 

   MAC Address Withdrawal is a mechanism described in [RFC4762] to 
   remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned, 
   for faster convergence. Failure of mechanisms that control loop free 
   connectivity (e.g Split Horizon) among VPLS PE nodes may cause MAC 
   Address Withdrawal messages looping among those nodes, leading to 
   Denial of Service (DoS) or complete failure of control plane in the 
   PE nodes. This document describes a mechanism to detect and prevent 
   loops of MAC Address Withdrawal messages in a VPLS PE node on such 
   failures.

1. Introduction 

   A method of Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is described in 
   [RFC4762]. A full mesh of pseudowire (PW)s is established between  
   PE devices to construct the VPLS core. The mesh topology provides a 
   LAN segment or broadcast domain that is fully capable of learning and 
   forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses at the PE devices. Since every 
   PE is now directly connected to every other PE in the core via a PW, 
   the topology forms a loop. A simpler loop breaking rule is used - the 
   "spilt horizon" rule, whereby a PE does not forward traffic from one 
   PW to another in the same VPLS mesh. Various mechanisms used to 
   enforce split horizon in the VPLS full mesh is out of scope of this 
   document.  

   For scalability, this VPLS full mesh core configuration can be  
   augmented with additional non-meshed spoke or MTU-s [RFC4762] nodes 
   to provide a Hierarchical VPLS (H-VPLS) service [RFC4762]. To protect 
   from connection failure of the spoke PW or the PE, the MTU-s or  
   the PE is dual-homed into two PE devices in the same VPLS  
   instance [Figure 1]. The dual homed connectivity forms a loop that  
   requires loop breaking mechanism. Various loop breaking mechanisms  
   are out of scope of this document.  
 
   MAC Address Withdrawal [RFC4762] is required to remove or unlearn MAC 
   addresses for faster convergence on topology change in H-VPLS (e.g., 
   failure of the primary link for a dual-homed VPLS capable switch). In 
   this document the term "MAC Flush Message" means the LDP Address 
   Withdraw Message with MAC List TLV used for MAC address withdrawal in 
   VPLS.

Internet-Draft         MAC Flush Loop Detection          September 2010 
    

   Failure of mechanisms that control loop free connectivity among VPLS 
   PE nodes may cause MAC Flush messages looping among the nodes. This 
   document describes a mechanism to detect and prevent such loops on 
   MAC Flush messages. 

   Note that such misconfiguration may cause loops, broadcast storms in 
   traffic forwarding as well. Data path loop detection and prevention 
   is outside the scope of this document. Implementations may deploy 
   methodologies available in native service forwarding to detect and 
   prevent such loops in data path.    

2. Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].    

3. Terminology 

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5036] and  
   [RFC4762]. Throughout this document VPLS means the emulated bridged  
   LAN service offered to a customer. H-VPLS means the hierarchical  
   Connectivity or layout of MTU-s and PE devices offering the     
   VPLS [RFC4762]. The terms spoke node and MTU-s in H-VPLS are used  
   interchangeably.

   When a MAC flush message is received by a PE device, it is processed 
   locally and propagated to all other PE devices participating in the 
   full mesh. The scope of MAC flush propagation in the full mesh is 
   limited by the same split horizon rules applied for forwarding VPLS 
   service traffic. MAC flush message received from a PE device

   participating in full mesh is not forwarded to another PE device in 
   the same full mesh. Due to failure of split horizon control 
   mechanisms or misconfiguration in the VPLS topology, a loop may get 
   created. Similarly, due to failure of loop breaking mechanism in 
   dual-homed topology a loop may get created among the participating PE 
   and/or MTU-s devices. In such a scenario, a MAC flush message may be 
   propagated by a PE or MTU-s to cause loops of MAC flush messages 
   through the control plane. Each such loop of a MAC flush message 
   causes replication to (N-1) messages, where N is number of PE devices 
   the replicating PE is connected to. Such looping of MAC flush 
   messages may lead to denial of service (DoS) attacks or complete 
   failure of the control plane. The control plane in PE or MTU-s 
   devices requires a fault tolerant mechanism to detect such loops and 
   protect against such failures. This document describes a loop 
   detection procedure in MAC Flush in a VPLS.  

5. Loop Detection in MAC Flush   

   MAC Flush Loop Detection is a configurable option in a VPLS capable 
   PE or MTU-s device that provides a mechanism for finding and 
   preventing MAC Flush messages from looping across the VPLS network. 

   The mechanism makes use of LDP Path Vector TLVs defined in [RFC 
   5036]. For loop detection in MAC Flush, Path Vector TLVs are carried 
   in the MAC Flush messages. 

   The following shows the encoding of Path Vector TLV when used for MAC 
   Flush Loop Detection. For backward compatibility the U bit and F bit 
   MUST be set as 1.

   The method builds on the following basic property of the TLV: 

       -  A Path Vector TLV contains a list of the PEs that the 
          containing MAC flush message has traversed. A PE is identified 
          in a Path Vector list by its unique LDP LSR Identifier, which 
          is the first four octets of its LDP Identifier. When a PE 
          propagates a MAC flush message containing a Path Vector, it 
          appends its LSR Id to the Path Vector list. An LSR that 
          receives a message with a Path Vector that contains its LSR 
          Id, detects that the message has traversed a loop.  

   The following paragraphs describe the MAC Flush Loop Detection 
   procedures. For these paragraphs, and only these paragraphs, "MUST" 
   is redefined to mean "MUST if configured for Loop Detection". Further 
   the term "PE device" is used specify a VPLS capable PE or a MTU-s 
   device.         

  5.1  Loop Detection Procedure in MAC Flush Message 

   The rules that govern use of the Path Vector TLV are LDP MAC Flush 
   messages by a PE when MAC Flush Loop Detection is enabled are the 
   following: 

       -  If PE device is originating the MAC Flush Message, it MUST 
          include a Path Vector TLV of length 1 containing its own LSR 
          Id. 

       -  If PE device is propagating the MAC flush as a result of 
          having received a MAC Flush from an upstream PE, then if the 
          MAC Flush contains a Path Vector TLV : 

             PE device MUST add its own LSR Id to the Path Vector, and      
             MUST pass the resulting Path Vector to its downstream PE  
             along with the MAC flush message propagated. If the MAC 
             flush message contains no Path Vector TLV, then PE MUST 
             include a Path Vector TLV of length 1 containing its own  
             LSR Id.  

       -  If PE device receives a MAC Flush Message from another PE 
          device with a Path Vector TLV containing its LSR Id or which 
          exceeds the maximum allowable length, then PE device detects 
          that the MAC flush message has traveled in a loop. By the 
          definition of Path Vector TLV in [RFC5036], supports the 
          notion of a maximum allowable Path Vector Length; a PE that 
          detects a Path Vector has reached the maximum length behaves 
          as if containing message has traversed a loop. Such limit MAY 
          be a locally configurable option in an implementation based on 
 
 
Kwok, et. al.           Expires March 8, 2011                  [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft         MAC Flush Loop Detection          September 2010 
    

          the scope of H-VPLS topology. The limit MAY also be driven by 
          payload size limitations of MAC flush messages. 

        - When PE device detects a loop, it MUST drop the MAC flush              
          message without processing and MUST NOT propagate the message  
          further. 

6. Applicability 

   If MAC Flush Loop Detection is desired in VPLS Network, then it 
   should be turned on in all PE devices within that VPLS Network, else 
   Loop Detection will not operate properly and may result in undetected 
   loops or in falsely detected loops. 

   PE devices that are configured for MAC Flush Loop Detection are not 
   expected to store the Path Vectors as part of the VPLS service. 

7. Security Considerations 

   - Control plane aspects    
      - LDP security (authentication) methods as described in [RFC5036]  
        is applicable here. Further this document implements security  
        considerations as in [RFC4447] and [RFC4762]. 
 
   - Data plane aspects 
      - This specification does not have any impact on the VPLS 
        forwarding plane. 
    

8. IANA Considerations 

   This document does not require any IANA consideration.

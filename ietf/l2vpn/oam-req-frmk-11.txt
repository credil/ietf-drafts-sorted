   Abstract 
    
   This draft provides framework and requirements for Layer 2 Virtual 
   Private Networks (L2VPN) Operation, Administration and Maintenance 
   (OAM). The OAM framework is intended to provide OAM layering across 
   L2VPN services, Pseudo Wires (PWs) and Packet Switched Network (PSN) 
   tunnels. The requirements are intended to identify OAM requirement 
   for L2VPN services (i.e. VPLS, VPWS, and IPLS). Furthermore, if 
   L2VPN services OAM requirements impose specific requirements on PW 
   OAM and/or PSN OAM, those specific PW and/or PSN OAM requirements 
   are also identified.

   1. Introduction 
    
   This draft provides framework and requirements for Layer 2 Virtual 
   Private Networks (L2VPN) Operation, Administration and Maintenance 
   (OAM). 
    
   The scope of OAM for any service and/or transport/network 
   infrastructure technologies can be very broad in nature. OSI has 
   defined the following five generic functional areas commonly 
   abbreviated as "FCAPS" [NM-Standards]: a) Fault Management, b) 
   Performance Management, c) Configuration Management, d) Accounting 
   Management, and e) Security Management.  
    
   This draft focuses on the Fault and Performance Management aspects. 
   Other functional aspects of FCAPS are for further study. 
    
   Fault Management can typically be viewed in terms of the following 
   categories: 
     - Fault Detection 
     - Fault Verification 
     - Fault Isolation 
     - Fault Notification & Alarm Suppression 
     - Fault Recovery 
    
   Fault Detection deals with mechanism(s) that can detect both hard 
   failures, such as link and device failures, and soft failures, such 
   as software failure, memory corruption, mis-configuration, etc. 
   Typically a lightweight protocol is desirable to detect the fault 
   and thus it would be prudent to verify the fault via Fault

   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   Verification mechanism before taking additional steps in isolating 
   the fault. After verifying that a fault has occurred along the data 
   path, it is important to be able to isolate the fault to the level 
   of a given device or link. Therefore, a Fault Isolation mechanism is 
   needed in Fault Management. Fault Notification mechanism can be used 
   in conjunction with Fault Detection mechanism to notify the devices 
   upstream and downstream to the fault detection point. For example, 
   when there is a client/server relationship between two layered 
   networks, Fault Detection at the server layer may result in the 
   following Fault Notifications:  
     - sending a forward Fault Notification from server layer to the 
        client layer network(s) using the Fault Notification format 
        appropriate to the client layer  
     - sending a backward Fault Notification at server layer, if 
        applicable, in the reverse direction 
     - sending a backward Fault Notification at client layer, if 
        applicable, in the reverse direction  
    
   Finally, Fault Recovery deals with recovering from the detected 
   failure by switching to an alternate available data path using 
   alternate devices or links (e.g., device redundancy or link 
   redundancy). 
    
   Performance Management deals with mechanism(s) that allow 
   determining and measuring the performance of network/services under 
   consideration. Performance Management can be used to verify the 
   compliance to both the service and network level metric 
   objectives/specifications. Performance Management typically consists 
   of measurement of performance metrics e.g. Frame Loss, Frame Delay, 
   Frame Delay Variation (aka Jitter) etc. across managed entities when 
   the managed entities are in available state. Performance Management 
   is suspended across unavailable managed entities.  
    
   [L2VPN-FRWK] specifies three different types of Layer 2 VPN 
   services. These are VPWS, VPLS and IPLS.  
    
   This document provides a reference model for OAM as it relates to 
   L2VPN services and their associated Pseudo Wires (PWs) and Public 
   Switched Network (PSN) tunnels. OAM requirement for L2VPN services 
   (e.g. VPLS and VPWS) are also identified. Furthermore, if L2VPN 
   services OAM requirements impose requirements for PW and/or PSN OAM, 
   those specific PW and/or PSN OAM requirements are also identified. 
    
 
   1.1 Relationship with Other OAM Work 
    
   This document leverages protocols, mechanisms and concepts defined 
   as part of other OAM work. More specifically: 
    
   IEEE Std. 802.1ag-2007 [IEEE 802.1ag] specifies the Ethernet 
   Connectivity Fault Management protocol, which defines the concepts 
   of Maintenance Domains, Maintenance End-Points and Maintenance 
   Intermediate Points. This standard also defines mechanisms and

   procedures for proactive fault detection (Continuity Check), fault 
   notification (Remote Defect Indication - RDI), fault verification 
   (Loopback) and fault isolation (LinkTrace) in Ethernet networks.  
    
   ITU-T Std. Y.1731 [Y.1731] builds upon and extends IEEE 802.1ag in 
   the following areas: it defines fault notification and alarm 
   suppression functions for Ethernet (via Alarm Indication Signal - 
   AIS). It also specifies messages and procedures for Ethernet 
   performance management, including loss, delay, jitter and throughput 
   measurement.   
 
   1.2 Terminology 
    
   This document introduces and uses the following terms. Further, this 
   document also uses the terms defined in [L2VPN-FRWK] and [L2VPN-
   TERM].

                domain and represents an entity requiring monitoring  
   MEG         Maintenance Entity Group which represents MEs belonging 
                to the same service instance. MEG is also called as 
                Maintenance Association (MA). 
   MEP         Maintenance End Point is responsible for origination 
                and termination of OAM frames for a given MEG

   [L2VPN-FRWK] specifies VPWS, VPLS and IPLS services. VPWS is a 
   point-to-point service where CEs are presented with point-to-point 
   virtual circuits. VPLS is a bridged LAN service provided to a set of 
   CEs that are members of a VPN. CEs that are members of the same 
   service instance communicate with each other as if they are 
   connected via a bridged LAN. IPLS is a special VPLS which is used to 
   carry only IP service packets. 
    
   [L2VPN-REQ] assumes the availability of runtime monitoring protocols 
   while defining requirements for management interfaces. This draft 
   specifies the requirements and framework for operations, 
   administration and maintenance (OAM) protocols between network 
   devices. 
    
    
   3. L2VPN OAM Framework 
   3.1. OAM Layering 
    
   The point-to-point or bridged LAN functionality is emulated by a 
   network of PEs to which the CEs are connected. This network of PEs 
   can belong to a single network operator or can span across multiple 
   network operators. Furthermore, it can belong to a single service 
   provider or can span across multiple service providers. A service 
   provider is responsible for providing L2VPN services to its 
   customers; whereas, a network operator (aka facility provider) 
   provides the necessary facilities to the service provider(s) in 
   support of their services.  A network operator and a service 
   provider can be part of same administrative organization or they can 
   be different administrative organizations.

   Different layers involved in realizing L2VPNs include service layer 
   and network layers. Network layers can be iterative. In context of 
   L2VPNs, the service layers consists of VPLS, VPWS (e.g. Ethernet, 
   ATM, FR, HDLC, SONET, etc. point-to-point emulation), and IPLS. 
   Similarly in context of L2VPNs, network layers consist of MPLS/IP 
   networks. The MPLS/IP networks can consist of networks links 
   realized by different technologies e.g. SONET, Ethernet, ATM etc. 
    
   Each layer is responsible for its own OAM. This document provides 
   the OAM framework and requirements for L2VPN services and networks. 
    
    
   3.2. OAM Domains 
    
   When discussing OAM tools for L2VPNs it is important to provide OAM 
   capabilities and functionality over each domain that a service 
   provider or a network operator is responsible for. For these 
   reasons, it is also important that OAM frames are not allowed to 
   enter/exit other domains. We define an OAM domain as a network 
   region over which OAM frames operate unobstructed as explained 
   below.  
    
   At the edge of an OAM domain, filtering constructs should prevent 
   OAM frames from exiting and entering that domain. OAM domains can be 
   nested but not overlapped. In other words, if there is a hierarchy 
   of the OAM domains, the OAM frames of a higher-level domain pass 
   transparently through the lower-level domains but the OAM frames of 
   a lower-level domain get blocked/filtered at the edge of that 
   domain.  
    
   In order to facilitate the processing of OAM frames, each OAM domain 
   can be associated with a level at which it operates. Higher level 
   OAM domains can contain lower level OAM domains but the converse is 
   not true. It may be noted that the higher level domain does not 
   necessarily mean a higher numerical value of the level encoding in 
   the OAM frame. 
    
   A PE can be part of several OAM domains with each interface 
   belonging to the same or a different OAM domain. A PE shall block 
   outgoing OAM frames and filter out incoming OAM frames whose domain 
   level is lower or same to the one configured on that interface and 
   pass through the OAM frames whose domain level is higher than the 
   one configured on that interface.  
    
   Generically, L2VPNs can be viewed as consisting of customer OAM 
   domain, service provider OAM domain, and network operator OAM domain 
   as depicted in Figure 2.

                       Figure 2: OAM Domains 
    
    
   The OAM Domains can be categorized as: 
    
     8 Hierarchical OAM Domains: Hierarchical OAM Domains result from 
        OAM Layering and imply a contractual agreement among the OAM 
        Domain ownerships. In the above example, Customer OAM Domain, 
        Service Provider OAM Domain and Operator OAM Domains are 
        hierarchical. 
     8 Adjacent OAM Domains: Adjacent OAM Domains are typically 
        independent of each other and do not have any relationship 
        among them. In the above example, the different Operator OAM 
        Domains are independent of each other. 
    
    
   3.3. MEPs and MIPs 
    
   Maintenance End Points (MEPs) are responsible for origination and 
   termination of OAM frames. MEPs are located at the edge of their 
   corresponding OAM domains. Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs) 
   are located within their corresponding OAM domains and they normally 
   pass OAM frames but never initiate them. Since MEPs are located at 
   the edge of their OAM domains, they are responsible for filtering 
   outbound OAM frames from leaving the OAM domain or inbound OAM 
   frames from entering the OAM domain.  
    
   An OAM frame is generally associated with a Maintenance Entity (ME) 
   or a Maintenance Entity Group (MEG), where a MEG consists of a set 
   of MEs associated with the same service instance. A ME is a point-
   to-point association between a pair of MEPs and represents a 
   monitored entity. For example, in a VPLS service which involves n 
   CEs, all the MEs associated with the VPLS service in the customer

   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   OAM domain (i.e. from CE to CE) can be considered to be part of a 
   VPLS MEG, where the n-point MEG consists of a maximum of n(n-1)/2 
   MEs. MEPs and MIPs correspond to a PE or more specifically to an 
   interface of a PE. For example, an OAM frame can be said to 
   originate from an ingress PE or more specifically an ingress 
   interface of that PE. A MEP on a PE receives messages from n-1 other 
   MEPs (some of them may reside on the same PE) for a given MEG. 
    
   In Hierarchical OAM Domains, a MEP of lower-level OAM domain can 
   correspond to a MIP or a MEP of a higher-level OAM domain. 
   Furthermore, the MIPs of a lower-level OAM domain are always 
   transparent to the higher-level OAM domain (e.g., OAM frames of a 
   higher-level OAM domain are not seen by MIPs of a lower-level OAM 
   domain and get passed through them transparently). Further, the MEs 
   (or MEGs) are hierarchically organized in hierarchical OAM domains. 
   For example, in a VPWS service, the VPWS ME in Customer OAM domain 
   can coincide with the Attachment Circuit (AC) ME, PW ME and another 
   AC ME in Service Provider OAM Domain. Similarly, the PW ME can 
   coincide with different ME in Operator OAM Domains. 
    
    
   3.4. MEP and MIP Identifiers 
    
   As mentioned previously, OAM at each layer should be independent of 
   other layers e.g. service layer OAM should be independent of 
   underlying transport layer. MEPs and MIPs at each layer should be 
   identified with layer specific identifiers. 
    
    
   4. OAM Framework for VPLS 
    
   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is used in different contexts. In 
   general, VPLS is used in the following contexts: a) as a bridged LAN 
   service over networks, some of which are MPLS/IP, b) as an MPLS/IP 
   network supporting these bridged LAN services, and c) as (V)LAN 
   emulation.  
    
    
   4.1. VPLS as Service/Network 
    
   4.1.1. VPLS as Bridged LAN Service 
    
   The most common definition for VPLS is for bridged LAN service over 
   an MPLS/IP network. The service coverage is considered end-to-end 
   from UNI to UNI (or AC to AC) among the CE devices and it provides a 
   virtual LAN service to the attached CEs belonging to that service 
   instance. The reason it is called bridged LAN service is because the 
   VPLS-capable PE providing this end-to-end virtual LAN service is 
   performing bridging functions (either full or a subset) as described 
   in the [L2VPN-FRWK]. This VPLS definition, as specified in [L2VPN-
   REQ], includes both bridge module and LAN emulation module (as 
   specified in [L2VPN-FRWK]).

   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   A VPLS service instance is also analogous to a VLAN provided by IEEE 
   802.1Q networks since each VLAN provides a Virtual LAN service to 
   its MAC users. Therefore, when a part of the service provider 
   network is Ethernet based (such as H-VPLS with QinQ access network), 
   there is a one-to-one correspondence between a VPLS service instance 
   and its corresponding provider VLAN in the service provider Ethernet 
   network. To check the end-to-end service integrity, the OAM 
   mechanism needs to cover the end-to-end VPLS service as defined in 
   [L2VPN-REQ] which is from AC to AC including bridge module, VPLS 
   forwarder, and the associated PWs for this service. This draft 
   specifies the framework and requirements for such OAM mechanism.  
    
    
   4.1.2. VPLS as a Network 
    
   Sometimes VPLS is also used to refer to the underlying network that 
   supports bridged LAN services. This network can be an end-to-end 
   MPLS/IP network as H-VPLS with MPLS/IP access or can be a hybrid 
   network consisting of MPLS/IP core and Ethernet access network as in 
   H-VPLS with QinQ access. In either case, the network consists of a 
   set of VPLS-capable PE devices capable of performing bridging 
   functions (either full or a subset). These VPLS-capable PE devices 
   can be arranged in a certain topology such as hierarchical topology 
   (H-VPLS) or distributed topology (D-VPLS) or some other topologies 
   such as multi-tier or star topologies. To check the network 
   integrity regardless of the network topology, network-level OAM 
   mechanisms (such as OAM for MPLS/IP networks) are needed. The 
   discussion of network-level OAM is outside of the scope of this 
   draft.  
    
    
   4.1.3. VPLS as (V)LAN Emulation 
    
   Sometimes VPLS also refers to (V)LAN emulation. In such context, 
   VPLS only refers to the full mesh of PWs with split horizon that 
   emulates a LAN segment over MPLS/IP network for a given service 
   instance and its associated VPLS forwarder. Since the emulated LAN 
   segment is presented as a Virtual LAN (VLAN) to the bridge module of 
   a VPLS-capable PE, the emulated segment is also referred to as an 
   emulated VLAN. The OAM mechanisms in this context refer primarily to 
   integrity check of VPLS forwarders and its associated full-mesh of 
   PWs and the ability to detect and notify a partial mesh failure.  
   This draft also covers the OAM framework and requirements for such 
   OAM mechanism. 
    
    
   4.2. VPLS OAM 
    
   When discussing the OAM mechanisms for VPLS, it is important to 
   consider that the end-to-end service can span across different types 
   of L2VPN networks. As an example, in case of [VPLS-LDP], the access 
   network on one side can be bridged network e.g. [IEEE 802.1ad], as 
   described in section 11 of [VPLS-LDP]. The access network can also 
    
     
   Sajassi & Mohan      Expires: January 2011               [Page 11] 
   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   be a [IEEE 802.1ah] based bridged network. The access network on 
   other side can be MPLS based as described in section 10 of [VPLS-
   LDP]; and the core network connecting them can be IP, MPLS, ATM, or 
   SONET. Similarly, the VPLS service instance can span across [VPLS-
   BGP], and distributed VPLS as described in [L2VPN-SIG].  
    
   Therefore, it is important that the OAM mechanisms can be applied to 
   all these network types. Each such network may be associated with a 
   separate administrative domain and also multiple such networks may 
   be associated with a single administrative domain. It is important 
   to ensure that the OAM mechanisms are independent of the underlying 
   transport mechanisms and solely rely on VPLS service, i.e. the 
   transparency of OAM mechanisms must be ensured over underlying 
   transport technologies such as MPLS, IP, etc. 
    
   This proposal is aligned with the discussions in other standard 
   bodies and groups such as ITU-T Q.5/13, IEEE 802.1, and MEF which 
   address Ethernet network and service OAM.  
    
    
   4.2.1. VPLS OAM Layering 
    
   Figure 3 shows an example of a VPLS service (with two CE belonging 
   to customer A) across a service provider network marked by UPE and 
   NPE devices. More CE devices belonging to the same Customer A can be 
   connected across different customer sites. Service provider network 
   is segmented into core network and two types of access network. 
   Figure 3(A) shows the bridged access network represented by its 
   bridge components marked B, and the MPLS access and core network 
   represented by MPLS components marked P. Figure 3(B) shows the 
   service/network view at the Ethernet MAC layer marked by E.

   As shown in Figure 3(B), only the devices with Ethernet 
   functionality are visible to OAM mechanisms operating at Ethernet 
   MAC layer and the P devices are invisible. Therefore, the OAM along 
   the path of P devices (e.g., between two PEs) is covered by 
   transport layer and it is outside the scope of this document.

   However, VPLS services may impose some specific requirements on PSN 
   OAM. This document aims to identify such requirements. 
    
   4.2.2. VPLS OAM Domains 
    
   As described in the previous section, a VPLS service for a given 
   customer can span across one or more service providers and network 
   operators. Figure 4 depicts three OAM domains: (A) customer domain 
   which is among the CEs of a given customer, (B) service provider 
   domain which is among the edge PEs of the given service provider, 
   and (C) network operator domain which is among the PEs of a given 
   operator.

   As shown in Figure 5, (C) represents those MEPs and MIPs that are 
   visible within the customer domain. The MIP associated with (C) are 
   expected to be implemented in the bridge module/VPLS forwarder of a 
   PE device, as per the [L2VPN-FRWK]. (D) represents the MEPs and MIPs 
   visible within the service provider domain. These MEPs and MIPs are 
   expected to be implemented in the bridge module/VPLS forwarder of a 
   PE device, as per the [L2VPN-FRWK]. (E) represents the MEPs and MIPs 
   visible within each operator domain where MIPs only exist in an 
   Ethernet access network (e.g., an MPLS access network doesn't have 
   MIPs at the operator level). Further, (F) represents the MEPs and 
   MIPs corresponding to the MPLS layer and may apply MPLS based 
   mechanisms. The MPLS layer shown in Figure 5 is just an example and 
   specific OAM mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.

   4.2.4. VPLS MEP and MIP Identifiers 
    
   In VPLS, for Ethernet MAC layer, the MEPs and MIPs should be 
   identified with their Ethernet MAC addresses. As described in [VPLS-
   LDP], VPLS instance can be identified in an Ethernet domain (e.g., 
   802.1ad domain) using VLAN tag (service tag) while in an MPLS/IP 
   network, PW-ids are used. Both PW-ids and VLAN tags for a given VPLS 
   instance are associated with a Service Identifier (e.g., VPN 
   identifier). MEPs and MIPs Identifiers, i.e. MEP Ids and MIP Ids, 
   must be unique within their corresponding Service Identifiers within 
   the OAM domains.  
    
   For Ethernet services, e.g. VPLS, Ethernet frames are used for OAM 
   frames and the source MAC address of the OAM frames represent the 
   source MEP in that domain. For unicast Ethernet OAM frames, the 
   destination MAC address represents the destination MEP in that 
   domain. For multicast Ethernet OAM frames, the destination MAC 
   addresses corresponds to all MEPs in that domain. 
    
    
   5. OAM Framework for VPWS 
    
   Figure 6 shows the VPWS reference model. VPWS is a point-to-point 
   service where CEs are presented with point-to-point virtual

   circuits. VPWS is realized by combining a pair of Attachment 
   Circuits between the CEs and PEs and a PW between PEs.

   5.1. VPWS as Service 
    
   VPWS service can be categorized as: 
     8 VPWS with homogeneous ACs (where both ACs are same type) 
     8 VPWS with heterogeneous ACs (where the ACs are of different 
        Layer-2 encapsulation) 
    
   Further, the VPWS can itself be classified as: 
     8 Homogeneous VPWS (when two ACs and PW are of the same type) 
     8 Heterogeneous VPWS (when at least one AC or PW is different 
        type than the others)  
    
   Based on the above classifications, the heterogeneous VPWS may have 
   either homogeneous or heterogeneous ACs. On the other hand, 
   homogeneous VPWS can have only homogeneous ACs. 
    
    
   5.2. VPWS OAM 
    
   When discussing the OAM mechanisms for VPWS, it is important to 
   consider that the end-to-end service can span across different types 
   of networks. As an example, the access network between CE and PE on 
   one side can be Ethernet bridged network, ATM network, etc. In 
   common scenarios, it could simply be a point-to-point interface such 
   as Ethernet PHY.  The core network connecting PEs can be IP, MPLS, 
   etc. 
    
   Therefore, it is important that the OAM mechanisms can be applied to 
   different network types some of which are mentioned above. Each such 
   network may be associated with a separate administrative domain and 
   also multiple such networks may be associated with a single

   5.2.1. VPWS OAM Layering 
    
   Figure 7 shows an example of a VPWS service (with two CE devices 
   belonging to customer A) across a service provider network marked by 
   PE devices. Service provider network can be considered to be 
   segmented into a core network and two types of access network.  
    
   In the most general case, a PE can be client service aware when it 
   processes client service PDUs and is responsible for encapsulating 
   and de-encapsulating client service PDUs onto PWs and ACs. This is 
   particularly relevant for homogeneous VPWS. The service specific 
   device view for such a deployment is highlighted by Figure 7(A) for 
   these are the devices that are expected to be involved in end-to-end 
   VPWS OAM. 
    
   In other instances, a PE can be client service unaware when it does 
   not process native service PDUs but instead encapsulates access 
   technology PDUs over PWs. This may be relevant for VPWS with 
   heterogeneous ACs. For example, if the service is Ethernet VPWS 
   which is offered across an ATM AC, ATM PW and Ethernet AC. In this 
   case, the PE which is attached to ATM AC and ATM PW may be 
   transparent to the client Ethernet service PDUs. On the other hand, 
   the PE which is attached to ATM PW and Ethernet AC is expected to be 
   client Ethernet service aware. The service specific device view for 
   such a deployment is highlighted by Figure 7(B) for these are the 
   devices that are expected to be involved in end-to-end VPWS OAM, 
   where PE1 is expected to be client service unaware.

   5.2.2. VPWS OAM Domains

   As described in the previous section, a VPWS service for a given 
   customer can span across one or more network operators.  
    
   Figure 8a and 8b depicts three OAM domains: (A) customer domain 
   which is among the CEs of a given customer, (B) service provider 
   domain which depends on the management model, and (C) network 
   operator domain which is among the PEs of a given operator and could 
   also be present in the access network if the ACs are provided by a 
   different network operator. The core network operator may be 
   responsible for managing the PSN Tunnel in these examples. 
    
   For the first management model, as shown in Figure 8a, the CEs are 
   expected to be managed by the customer and the customer is 
   responsible for running end-to-end service OAM, if needed. The 
   service provider is responsible for monitoring the PW ME and the 
   monitoring of the AC is the shared responsibility of the customer 
   and the service provider. In most simple cases, when the AC is 
   realized across a physical interface that connects the CE to PE, the 
   monitoring requirements across the AC ME are minimal.

            Figure 8a: VPWS OAM Domains - Management Model 1 
    
    
   Figure 8b highlights another management model, where the CEs are 
   managed by the Service Provider and where CEs and PEs are connected 
   via an access network. The access network between the CEs and PEs 
   may or may not be provided by a distinct network operator. In this 
   model, the VPWS service ME spans between the CEs in the Service 
   Provider OAM Domain, as shown by Figure 8b(B). The Service Provider 
   OAM Domain may additionally monitor the AC MEs and PW MEs 
   individually, as shown by Figure 8b(C). The network operators may be 
   responsible for managing the access service MEs (e.g. access 
   tunnels) and core PSN Tunnel MEs, as shown by Figure 8b(D). The

   distinction between Figure 8b-(C) and 8(b)-D) is that in (C), MEs 
   have MEPs at CEs and at PEs, and have no MIPs. While in (D) MEs have 
   MEPs at CEs and at PEs and furthermore, MIPs may be present in 
   between the MEPs; thereby, providing visibility of the network to 
   the operator.

   Note: It may be noted that unlike VPLS OAM Domain in Figure 4, where 
   multiple operator domains may occur between the U-PE devices, VPWS 
   OAM domain in Figure 8a and 8b highlight a single Operator domain 
   between PE devices. This is since unlike the distributed VPLS PE 
   case (H-VPLS) where VPLS service aware U-PEs and N-PEs may be used 
   to realize a distributed PE, the VPWS has no such distributed PE 
   model. If the PSN involves multiple Operator domains, resulting in a 
   Multi-segment PW [Ms-PW Arch], VPWS OAM Domains remain unchanged 
   since S-PEs are typically not aware of native service. 
    
 
   5.2.3. VPWS MEPs & MIPs 
    
   The location of MEPs and MIPs can be based upon the management model 
   used in the VPWS scenarios. The interest remains in being able to 
   monitor end-to-end service and also support segment monitoring in 
   the network to allow isolation of faults to specific areas within 
   the network. 
    
    
     
   Sajassi & Mohan      Expires: January 2011               [Page 18] 
   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   The end-to-end service monitoring is provided by end-to-end ME and 
   additional segment OAM monitoring is provided by segment MEs, all in 
   the Service Provider OAM Domain. The end-to-end MEs and segment MEs 
   are hierarchically organized as mentioned earlier for hierarchical 
   OAM domains. This is shown in Figure 8b (B) and (C). 
    
   The CE interfaces support MEPs at the end-to-end Service Provider 
   OAM level for VPWS as an end-to-end service as shown in Figure 9 
   (B1) and (B2). In addition, PE interfaces may support MIPs at end-
   to-end Service Provider OAM level when PEs are client service aware, 
   as shown in Figure 9 (B2). As an example, if one considers an end-
   to-end Ethernet line service offered to a subscriber between CE1 and 
   CE2 which is realized via ATM type AC1 and AC2 and PW which 
   encapsulates ATM over MPLS, the PEs can be considered as Ethernet 
   service unaware, and therefore cannot support any Ethernet MIPs. 
   Figure 9 (B1) represents this particular situation. Of course, 
   another view of the end-to-end service can be ATM, in which case PE1 
   and PE2 can be considered to be service aware, and therefore support 
   ATM MIPs. Figure 9 (B2) represents this particular situation. 
    
   In addition, CEs and PE interfaces support MEPs at a segment (lower 
   level) Service Provider OAM level for AC and PW MEs and no MIPs are 
   involved at this segment Service Provider OAM Level, as shown in 
   Figure 9 (C). Operators may also run segment OAM by having MEPs at 
   Network Operator OAM level, as shown in Figure 9 (D). 
    
   The advantage of having layered OAM is that end-to-end and segment 
   OAM can be carried out in an independent manner. It is also possible 
   to carry out some optimizations, e.g. when proactive segment OAM 
   monitoring is performed, proactive end-to-end monitoring may not be 
   needed since client layer end-to-end ME could simply use fault 
   notifications from the server layer segment MEs. 
    
   Although many different OAM layers are possible, as shown in Figure 
   9, not all may be realized. For example, Figure (B2) and (D) may be 
   adequate in some cases.

                  Figure 9: VPWS MEPs & MIPs 
    
    
   5.2.4. VPWS MEP and MIP Identifiers 
    
   In VPWS, the MEPs and MIPs should be identified with their native 
   addressing schemes. MEPs and MIPs Identifiers, i.e. MEP Ids and MIP 
   Ids, must be unique within their corresponding OAM domains and must 
   also be unique to the VPWS service instance.  
    
    
   6. VPLS Service OAM Requirements 
    
   These requirements are applicable to VPLS PE offering VPLS as an 
   Ethernet Bridged LAN service, as described in Section 4.1.1. 
   Further, the performance metrics used in requirements are based on 
   [MEF10.1] and [RFC2544]. 
    
   It is noted that OAM solutions that meet the following requirements 
   may make use of existing OAM mechanisms e.g. Ethernet OAM, VCCV, 
   etc. however must not break these existing OAM mechanisms. If 
   extensions are required to existing OAM mechanisms, these should be 
   coordinated with relevant groups responsible for these OAM 
   mechanisms. 
    
    
   6.1. Discovery 
    
   Discovery allows a VPLS service aware device to learn about other 
   devices that support the same VPLS service instance within a given 
   domain.  
    
   Discovery also allows a VPLS service aware device to learn 
   sufficient information (e.g. IP addresses, MAC addressed etc.) from 
   other VPLS service aware devices such that VPLS OAM frames can be 
   exchanged among the service aware devices. 
    
   (R1) VPLS OAM MUST allow a VPLS service aware device to discover 
   other devices that share the same VPLS service instance(s) within a 
   given OAM domain. 
    
    
   6.2. Connectivity Fault Management 
    
   VPLS service is realized by exchanging service frames/packets 
   between devices that support the same VPLS service instance. To 
   allow the exchange of service frames, connectivity between these 
   service aware devices is required.  
    
    
    
     
   Sajassi & Mohan      Expires: January 2011               [Page 20] 
   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   6.2.1. Connectivity Fault Detection 
   
   To ensure service, pro-active connectivity monitoring is required. 
   Connectivity monitoring facilitates connectivity fault detection. 
    
   (R2a) VPLS OAM MUST allow pro-active connectivity monitoring between 
   two VPLS service aware devices that support the same VPLS service 
   instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   6.2.2. Connectivity Fault Verification 
   
   Once a connectivity fault is detected, connectivity fault 
   verification may be performed.  
    
   (R2b) VPLS OAM MUST allow connectivity fault verification between 
   two VPLS service aware devices that support the same VPLS service 
   instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   6.2.3. Connectivity Fault Localization 
   
   Further, localization of connectivity fault may be carried out.  
    
   (R2c) VPLS OAM MUST allow connectivity fault localization between 
   two VPLS service aware devices that support the same VPLS service 
   instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   6.2.4. Connectivity Fault Notification and Alarm Suppression 
   
   Typically, when connectivity fault is detected and optionally 
   verified, VPLS service device may notify the NMS (Network Management 
   System) via alarms.  
    
   However, a single transport/network fault may cause multiple 
   services to fail simultaneously causing multiple service alarms. 
   Therefore, VPLS OAM must allow service level fault notification to 
   be triggered at the client layer as a result of transport/network 
   faults in the service layer. This fault notification should be used 
   for the suppression of service level alarms at the client layer. 
    
   (R2d) VPLS OAM MUST support fault notification to be triggered as a 
   result of transport/network faults. This fault notification SHOULD 
   be used for the suppression of redundant service level alarms. 
    
    
   6.3. Frame Loss 
    
   A VPLS service may be considered degraded if service-layer 
   frames/packets are lost during transit between the VPLS service 
   aware devices. To determine if a VPLS service is degraded due to 
   frame/packet loss, measurement of frame/packet loss is required. 
    
     
   Sajassi & Mohan      Expires: January 2011               [Page 21] 
   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
    
   (R3) VPLS OAM MUST support measurement of per-service frame/packet 
   loss between two VPLS service aware devices that support the same 
   VPLS service instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   6.4. Frame Delay 
    
   A VPLS service may be sensitive to delay experienced by the VPLS 
   frames/packets during transit between the VPLS service aware 
   devices. To determine if a VPLS service is degraded due to 
   frame/packet delay, measurement of frame/packet delay is required. 
    
   VPLS frame/packet delay measurement can be of two types: 
    
   One-way delay 
   One-way delay is used to characterize certain applications like 
   multicast and broadcast applications. The measurement for one-way 
   delay usually requires clock synchronization between two devices in 
   question. 
    
   Two-way delay 
   Two-way delay or round-trip delay does not require clock 
   synchronization between two devices involved in measurement and is 
   usually sufficient to determine the frame/packet delay being 
   experienced.  
 
   (R4a) VPLS OAM MUST support measurement of per-service two-way 
   frame/packet delay between two VPLS service aware devices that 
   support the same VPLS service instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
   (R4b) VPLS OAM SHOULD support measurement of per-service one-way 
   frame/packet delay between two VPLS service aware devices that 
   support the same VPLS service instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   6.5. Frame Delay Variation 
    
   A VPLS service may be sensitive to delay variation experienced by 
   the VPLS frames/packets during transit between the VPLS service 
   aware devices. To determine if a VPLS service is degraded due to 
   frame/packet delay variation, measurement of frame/packet delay 
   variation is required. For frame/packet delay variation 
   measurements, one-way mechanisms are considered to be sufficient. 
    
   (R5) VPLS OAM MUST support measurement of per-service frame/packet 
   delay variation between two VPLS service aware devices that support 
   the same VPLS service instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   6.6. Availability 
    
    
     
   Sajassi & Mohan      Expires: January 2011               [Page 22] 
   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   A service may be considered unavailable if the service 
   frames/packets do not reach their intended destination (e.g. 
   connectivity is down or frame/packet loss is occurring) or the 
   service is degraded (e.g. frame/packet delay and/or delay variation 
   threshold is exceeded).  
    
   Entry and exit conditions may be defined for unavailable state. 
   Availability itself may be defined in context of service type.  
    
   Since availability measurement may be associated with connectivity, 
   frame/packet loss, frame/packet delay and frame/packet delay 
   variation measurements, no additional requirements are specified 
   currently. 
    
    
   6.7. Data Path Forwarding 
    
   If the VPLS OAM frames flow across a different path than the one 
   used by VPLS service frames/packets, accurate measurement and/or 
   determination of service state may not be made. Therefore data path, 
   i.e. the one being taken by VPLS service frames/packets, must be 
   used for the VPLS OAM. 
    
   (R6) VPLS OAM frames MUST be forwarded along the same path (i.e. 
   links and nodes) as the VPLS service/data frames. 
    
    
   6.8. Scalability 
    
   Mechanisms developed for VPLS OAM need to be such that per-service 
   OAM can be supported even though the OAM may only be used for 
   limited VPLS service instances, e.g. premium VPLS service instances, 
   and may not be used for best-effort VPLS services. 
    
    (R7) VPLS OAM MUST be scalable such that a service aware device can 
   support OAM for each VPLS service that is supported by the device. 
    
    
   6.9. Extensibility 
    
   Extensibility is intended to allow introduction of additional OAM 
   functionality in future such that backward compatibility can be 
   maintained when interoperating with older version devices. In such a 
   case, VPLS OAM with reduced functionality should still be possible. 
   Further, VPLS Service OAM should be defined such that OAM incapable 
   devices in the middle of the OAM domain should be able to forward 
   the VPLS OAM frames similar to the regular VPLS service/data 
   frames/packets. 
    
   (R8a) VPLS OAM MUST be extensible such that new functionality and 
   information elements related to this functionality can be introduced 
   in future.

   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   (R8b) VPLS OAM MUST be defined such that devices not supporting the 
   OAM are able to forward the OAM frames in a similar fashion as the 
   regular VPLS service/data frames/packets. 
    
    
   6.10. Security 
    
   VPLS OAM frames belonging to an OAM domain originate and terminate 
   within that OAM domain. Security implies that an OAM domain must be 
   capable of filtering OAM frames. The filtering is such that the OAM 
   frames are prevented from leaking outside their domain. Also, OAM 
   frames from outside the OAM domains should be either discarded (when 
   such OAM frames belong to same or lower-level OAM domain) or 
   transparently passed (when such OAM frames belong to a higher-level 
   OAM domain).  
    
   (R9a) VPLS OAM frames MUST be prevented from leaking outside their 
   OAM domain. 
    
   (R9b) VPLS OAM frames from outside an OAM domain MUST be prevented 
   from entering the OAM domain when such OAM frames belong to the same 
   level or lower-level OAM domain. 
    
   (R9c) VPLS OAM frames from outside an OAM domain MUST be transported 
   transparently inside the OAM domain when such OAM frames belong to 
   the higher-level OAM domain. 
    
    
   6.11. Transport Independence 
    
   VPLS service frame/packets delivery is carried out across transport 
   infrastructure, also called network infrastructure. Though specific 
   transport/network technologies may provide their own OAM 
   capabilities, VPLS OAM must be independently supported as many 
   different transport/network technologies can be used to carry 
   service frame/packets. 
    
   (R10a) VPLS OAM MUST be independent of the underlying 
   transport/network technologies and specific transport/network OAM 
   capabilities. 
    
   (R10b) VPLS OAM MAY allow adaptation/interworking with specific 
   transport/network OAM functions. For example, this would be useful 
   to allow Fault Notifications from transport/network layer(s) to be 
   sent to the VPLS service layer. 
    
    
   6.12. Application Independence 
    
   VPLS service itself may be used to carry application frame/packets. 
   The application may use its own OAM; service OAM must not be 
   dependent on application OAM. As an example, a VPLS service may be

   used to carry IP traffic; however, VPLS OAM should not assume IP or 
   rely on the use of IP level OAM functions. 
    
   (R11a) VPLS OAM MUST be independent of the application technologies 
   and specific application OAM capabilities. 
    
    
    
   7. VPWS OAM Requirements 
    
   These requirements are applicable to VPWS PE. The performance 
   metrics used in requirements are based on [MEF10.1] and [RFC2544], 
   which are applicable to Ethernet Services. 
    
   It is noted that OAM solutions that meet the following requirements 
   may make use of existing OAM mechanisms e.g. Ethernet OAM, VCCV, 
   etc. however must not break these existing OAM mechanisms. If 
   extensions are required to existing OAM mechanisms, these should be 
   coordinated with relevant groups responsible for these OAM 
   mechanisms. 
    
    
   7.1. Discovery 
    
   Discovery allows a VPWS service aware device to learn about other 
   devices that support the same VPWS service instance within a given 
   domain. Discovery also allows a VPWS service aware device to learn 
   sufficient information (e.g. IP addresses, MAC addresses etc.) from 
   other VPWS service aware devices such that OAM frames can be 
   exchanged among the VPWS service aware devices. 
    
   (R12) VPWS OAM MUST allow a VPWS service aware device to discover 
   other devices that share the same VPWS service instance(s) within a 
   given OAM domain. 
    
    
   7.2. Connectivity Fault Management 
    
   VPWS Service is realized by exchanging service frames/packets 
   between devices that support the same VPWS service instance. To 
   allow the exchange of service frames, connectivity between these 
   service aware devices is required. 
    
   7.2.1. Connectivity Fault Detection 
    
   To ensure service, pro-active connectivity monitoring is required. 
   Connectivity monitoring facilitates connectivity fault detection. 
    
   (R13a) VPWS OAM MUST allow pro-active connectivity monitoring 
   between two VPWS service aware devices that support the same VPWS 
   service instance within a given OAM domain.

   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   (R13b) VPWS OAM mechanism SHOULD allow detection of misbranching or 
   misconnections. 
    
    
   7.2.2. Connectivity Fault Verification 
    
   Once a connectivity fault is detected, connectivity fault 
   verification may be performed. 
    
   (R13c) VPWS OAM MUST allow connectivity fault verification between 
   two VPWS service aware devices that support the same VPWS service 
   instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   7.2.3. Connectivity Fault Localization 
    
   Further, localization of connectivity fault may be carried out. This 
   may amount to identifying the specific AC and/or PW that is 
   resulting in the VPWS connectivity fault. 
    
   (R13d) VPWS OAM MUST allow connectivity fault localization between 
   two VPWS service aware devices that support the same VPWS service 
   instance within a given OAM domain.  
    
    
   7.2.4. Connectivity Fault Notification and Alarm Suppression 
    
   Typically, when connectivity fault is detected and optionally 
   verified, service device may notify the NMS (Network Management 
   System) via alarms. 
    
   However, a single transport/network fault may cause multiple 
   services to fail simultaneously causing multiple service alarms. 
   Therefore, OAM must allow service level fault notification to be 
   triggered at the client layer as a result of transport/network 
   faults in the service layer. This fault notification should be used 
   for the suppression of service level alarms at the client layer.  
    
   For example, if an AC fails, both local CE and local PE which are 
   connected via AC may detect the connectivity failure. The local CE 
   must notify the remote CE about the failure while the local PE must 
   notify the remote PE about the failure. 
    
   (R13e) VPWS OAM MUST MUST support fault notification to be triggered 
   as a result of transport/network faults. This fault notification 
   SHOULD be used for the suppression of redundant service level 
   alarms. 
    
    
   (R13f) VPWS OAM SHOULD support fault notification in backward 
   direction, to be triggered as a result of transport/network faults. 
   This fault notification SHOULD be used for the suppression of 
   redundant service level alarms.

   7.3. Frame Loss 
    
   A VPWS service may be considered degraded if service-layer 
   frames/packets are lost during transit between the VPWS service 
   aware devices. To determine if a VPWS service is degraded due to 
   frame/packet loss, measurement of frame/packet loss is required. 
    
   (R14) VPWS OAM MUST support measurement of per-service frame/packet 
   loss between two VPWS service aware devices that support the same 
   VPWS service instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   7.4. Frame Delay 
    
   A VPWS service may be sensitive to delay experienced by the VPWS 
   service frames/packets during transit between the VPWS service aware 
   devices. To determine if a VPWS service is degraded due to 
   frame/packet delay, measurement of frame/packet delay is required.  
    
   VPWS frame/packet delay measurement can be of two types: 
   - One-way delay 
   One-way delay is used to characterize certain applications like 
   multicast and broadcast applications. The measurement for one-way 
   delay usually requires clock synchronization between two devices in 
   question. 
   - Two-way delay 
   Two-way delay or round-trip delay does not require clock 
   synchronization between two devices involved in measurement and is 
   usually sufficient to determine the frame/packet delay being 
   experienced. 
    
   (R15a) VPWS OAM MUST support measurement of per-service two-way 
   frame/packet delay between two VPWS service aware devices that 
   support the same VPWS service instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
   (R15b) VPWS OAM SHOULD support measurement of per-service one-way 
   frame/packet delay between two VPWS service aware devices that 
   support the same VPWS service instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   7.5. Frame Delay Variation 
    
   A VPWS service may be sensitive to delay variation experienced by 
   the VPWS frames/packets during transit between the VPWS service 
   aware devices. To determine if a VPWS service is degraded due to 
   frame/packet delay variation, measurement of frame/packet delay 
   variation is required. For frame/packet delay variation 
   measurements, one-way mechanisms are considered to be sufficient.

   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   (R16) VPWS OAM MUST support measurement of per-service frame/packet 
   delay variation between two VPWS service aware devices that support 
   the same VPWS service instance within a given OAM domain. 
    
    
   7.6. Availability 
    
   A service may be considered unavailable if the service 
   frames/packets do not reach their intended destination (e.g. 
   connectivity is down or frame/packet loss is occurring) or the 
   service is degraded (e.g. frame/packet delay and/or delay variation 
   threshold is exceeded). 
    
   Entry and exit conditions may be defined for unavailable state. 
   Availability itself may be defined in context of service type. 
   Since availability measurement may be associated with connectivity, 
   frame/packet loss, frame/packet delay and frame/packet delay 
   variation measurements, no additional requirements are specified 
   currently. 
    
    
   7.7. Data Path Forwarding 
    
   If the VPWS OAM frames flow across a different path than the one 
   used by VPWS service frames/packets, accurate measurement and/or 
   determination of service state may not be made. Therefore data path, 
   i.e. the one being taken by VPWS service frames/packets, must be 
   used for the VPWS OAM. 
    
   (R17a) VPWS OAM frames MUST be forwarded along the same path as the 
   VPWS service/data frames. 
    
   (R17b) VPWS OAM MUST be forwarded using the transfer plane (data 
   plane) as regular VPWS service/data frames/packets and must not rely 
   on control plane messages. 
    
    
   7.8. Scalability 
    
   Mechanisms developed for VPWS OAM need to be such that per-service 
   OAM can be supported even though the OAM may only be used for 
   limited VPWS service instances, e.g. premium VPWS service instance, 
   and may not be used for best-effort services.  
    
   (R18) VPWS OAM MUST be scalable such that a service aware device can 
   support OAM for each VPWS service that is supported by the device. 
    
    
   7.9. Extensibility 
    
   Extensibility is intended to allow introduction of additional OAM 
   functionality in future such that backward compatibility can be 
   maintained when interoperating with older version devices. In such a 
    
     
   Sajassi & Mohan      Expires: January 2011               [Page 28] 
   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   case, VPWS service OAM with reduced functionality should still be 
   possible. Further, VPWS service OAM should be such that OAM 
   incapable devices in the middle of the OAM domain should be able to 
   forward the VPWS OAM frames similar to the regular VPWS service/data 
   frames/packets. 
    
   (R19a) VPWS OAM MUST be extensible such that new functionality and 
   information elements related to this functionality can be introduced 
   in future. 
    
   (R19b) VPWS OAM MUST be defined such that devices not supporting the 
   OAM are able to forward the VPWS OAM frames in a similar fashion as 
   the regular VPWS service/data frames/packets. 
    
    
   7.10. Security 
    
   VPWS OAM frames belonging to an OAM domain originate and terminate 
   within that OAM domain. Security implies that an OAM domain must be 
   capable of filtering OAM frames. The filtering is such that the VPWS 
   OAM frames are prevented from leaking outside their domain. Also, 
   VPWS OAM frames from outside the OAM domains should be either 
   discarded (when such OAM frames belong to same or lower-level OAM 
   domain) or transparently passed (when such OAM frames belong to a 
   higher-level OAM domain). 
    
   (R20a) VPWS OAM frames MUST be prevented from leaking outside their 
   OAM domain. 
    
   (R20b) VPWS OAM frames from outside an OAM domain MUST be prevented 
   from entering the OAM domain when such OAM frames belong to the same 
   level or lower-level OAM domain. 
    
   (R20c) VPWS OAM frames from outside an OAM domain MUST be 
   transported transparently inside the OAM domain when such OAM frames 
   belong to the higher-level OAM domain. 
    
    
   7.11. Transport Independence 
    
   VPWS service frame/packets delivery is carried out across transport 
   infrastructure, also called network infrastructure. Though specific 
   transport/network technologies may provide their own OAM 
   capabilities, VPWS OAM must be independently supported as many 
   different transport/network technologies can be used to carry 
   service frame/packets. 
    
   (R21a) VPWS OAM MUST be independent of the underlying 
   transport/network technologies and specific transport/network OAM 
   capabilities. 
    
   (R21b) VPWS OAM MAY allow adaptation/interworking with specific 
   transport/network OAM functions. For example, this would be useful 
    
     
   Sajassi & Mohan      Expires: January 2011               [Page 29] 
   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
   to allow Fault Notifications from transport/network layer(s) to be 
   sent to the VPWS service layer. 
    
    
   7.12. Application Independence 
    
   VPWS service itself may be used to carry application frame/packets. 
   The application may use its own OAM; VPWS OAM must not be dependent 
   on application OAM. As an example, a VPWS service may be used to 
   carry IP traffic; however, VPWS OAM should not assume IP or rely on 
   the use of IP level OAM functions. 
    
   (R22a) OAM MUST be independent of the application technologies and 
   specific application OAM capabilities. 
    
    
    
   7.13. Prioritization 
    
   VPWS service could be composed of several data flows each related to 
   a given usage/application with specific requirements in term of 
   connectivity and/or performances. Dedicated VPWS OAM should be 
   applicable to these flows. 
    
   (R23) VPWS OAM SHOULD support configurable prioritization for OAM 
   packet/frames to be compatible with associated VPWS service 
   packets/frames. 
    
    
   8. VPLS (V)LAN Emulation OAM Requirements 
    
   8.1. Partial-mesh of PWs 
    
   As indicated in [BRIDGE-INTEROP], VPLS service OAM relies upon 
   bidirectional Ethernet links or (V)LAN segments and failure in one 
   direction or link results in failure of the whole link or (V)LAN 
   segment. Therefore, when partial-mesh failure occurs in (V)LAN 
   emulation, either the entire PW mesh should be shutdown when only an 
   entire VPLS service is acceptable or a subset of PWs should be 
   shutdown such that the remaining PWs have full connectivity among 
   them, when partial VPLS service is acceptable. 
    
   (R13a) PW OAM for PWs related to a (V)LAN emulation MUST allow 
   detection of partial-mesh failure condition. 
    
   (R13b) PW OAM for PWs related to a (V)LAN emulation MUST allow the 
   entire mesh of PWs to be shutdown upon detection of a partial-mesh 
   failure condition. 
    
   (R13c) PW OAM for PWs related to a (V)LAN emulation MUST allow the 
   subset of PWs to be shutdown upon detection of a partial-mesh 
   failure condition in a manner such that full mesh is present across 
   the remaining subset. 
    
     
   Sajassi & Mohan      Expires: January 2011               [Page 30] 
   Internet Draft   draft-ietf-l2vpn-oam-req-frmk-11.txt     July 2010 
    
    
   Note: Shutdown action in R13b and R13c may not necessarily involve 
   withdrawal of labels etc. 
    
    
   8.2. PW Fault Recovery 
    
   As indicated in [BRIDGE-INTEROP], VPLS service OAM fault detection 
   and recovery relies upon (V)LAN emulation recovery such that fault 
   detection and recovery time in (V)LAN emulation should be less than 
   the VPLS service fault detection and recovery time to prevent 
   unnecessary switch-over and temporary flooding/loop within customer 
   OAM domain that is dual-homed to provider OAM domain. 
    
   (R14a) PW OAM for PWs related to a (V)LAN emulation MUST support a 
   fault detection time in the provider OAM domain faster than the VPLS 
   fault detection time in the customer OAM domain. 
    
   (R14b) PW OAM for PWs related to a (V)LAN emulation MUST support a 
   fault recovery time in the provider OAM domain faster than the VPLS 
   fault recovery time in the customer OAM domain. 
    
   8.3. Connectivity Fault Notification and Alarm Suppression 
   
   When connectivity fault is detected in (V)LAN emulation, PE devices 
   may notify the NMS (Network Management System) via alarms. However, 
   a single (V)LAN emulation fault may result in CE devices or U-PE 
   devices detecting connectivity fault in VPLS service and therefore 
   also notifying the NMS. To prevent multiple alarms for the same 
   fault, (V)LAN emulation OAM must provide alarm suppression 
   capability in the VPLS service OAM. 
    
   (R15) PW OAM for PWs related to a (V)LAN emulation MUST support 
   interworking with VPLS service OAM to trigger fault notification and 
   allow alarm suppression in the VPLS service upon fault detection in 
   (V)LAN emulation. 
    
    
   9. OAM Operational Scenarios 
    
   This section highlights how the different OAM mechanisms can be 
   applied as per the OAM framework for different L2VPN services.

   Among the different MEs identified in Figure 5, for VPLS OAM in 
   Customer OAM domain, [IEEE 802.1ag] and [Y.1731] Ethernet OAM 
   mechanisms can be applied, to meet various requirements identified 
   in Section 6. The mechanisms can be applied across Figure 10 (C) 
   MEs.  
    
   Similarly, inside the Service Provider OAM domain, [IEEE 802.1ag] 
   and [Y.1731] Ethernet OAM mechanisms can be applied across Figure 10 
   (D) MEs to meet functional requirements identified in Section 6.  
    
   It may be noted that in the interim, when [IEEE 802.1ag] and 
   [Y.1731] capabilities are not available across the PE devices, the 
   fault management option using segment OAM introduced in Section 
   5.2.3 can be applied, with the limitations cited below. In this 
   option, the Service Provider can run segment OAM across the Figure 
   10 (D1) MEs. The OAM mechanisms across the Figure 10 (D1) MEs can be 
   non-Ethernet e.g. VCCV, or BFD when network technology is MPLS. The 
   Service Provider can monitor each sub-network segment ME using the 
   native technology OAM and by performing interworking across the 
   segment MEs, attempt to realize end-to-end monitoring between a pair 
   of VPLS end-points. However, such mechanisms do not fully utilize 
   the data plane forwarding as experienced by native (i.e. Ethernet) 
   service PDUs and therefore monitoring is severely limited in the 
   sense that monitoring at Figure 10 (D1) and interworking across them 
   could lead to an indication that the ME between VPLS end-points is 
   functional while the customer may be experiencing end-to-end 
   connectivity issues in the data plane. 
    
   Inside the Network Operator OAM domain, [IEEE 802.1ag] and [Y.1731] 
   Ethernet OAM mechanisms can also be applied across Figure 10 (E) MEs 
   to meet functional requirements identified in Section 6. In 
   addition, the network operator could decide to use native OAM

   mechanisms e.g. VCCV or BFD across Figure 10 (F) MEs for additional 
   monitoring or as an alternative to monitoring across Figure 10 (E) 
   MEs.

   11. Security Considerations 
    
   This document takes into account the security considerations and 
   imposes requirements on solutions to prevent OAM messages from 
   leaking outside an OAM domain and for OAM domains to be transparent 
   to OAM frames from higher OAM domains, as specified in Section 6.10 
   and 7.10.  
    
   For additional levels of security, the solutions may be required to 
   encrypt and/or authenticate OAM frames inside an OAM domain however 
   solutions are out of the scope of this draft.

   A1. Appendix 1 - Alternate Management Models 
    
   In consideration of the management models that can be deployed 
   besides the hierarchical models elaborated in this document, this 
   section highlights some alternate models that are not recommended 
   due to their limitations, as pointed out below. These alternatives 
   have been highlighted as potential interim models while the network 
   equipments are upgraded to support full functionality and meet the 
   requirements set forward by this document. 
    
     
   A1.1. Alternate Model 1 (Minimal OAM) 
    
   In this model, the end-to-end service monitoring is provided by 
   applying CE to CE ME in the Service Provider OAM Domain.

   A MEP is located at each CE interface that is part of the VPWS 
   service, as shown in Figure A1.1 (B). The network operators can 
   carry out segment (e.g. PSN Tunnel ME, etc.) monitoring independent 
   of the VPWS end-to-end service monitoring, as shown in Figure A1.1 
   (D). 
    
   The advantage of this option is that VPWS service monitoring is 
   limited to CEs. The limitation of this option is that the 
   localization of faults at the VPWS Service level.

   A1.2. Alternate Model 2 (Segment OAM Interworking) 
    
   In this model, the end-to-end service monitoring is provided by 
   interworking OAM across each segment. Typical segments involved in 
   this case include two AC MEs and PW ME, as shown in Figure A1.2 (C). 
   These segments are expected in the Service Provider OAM Domain. An 
   interworking function is required to transfer the OAM information 
   flows across the OAM segments for the purposes of end-to-end 
   monitoring. Depending on whether homogenous VPWS is deployed or 
   heterogeneous VPWS is deployed, the interworking function could be 
   straightforward or more involved. 
    
   In this option, the CE and PE interfaces support MEPs for AC and PW 
   MEs and no MIPs are involved at the Service Provider OAM Level, as 
   shown in Figure A1.2 (C). The network operators may run segment OAM 
   by having MEPs at Network Operator OAM level, as shown in Figure 
   A1.2 (D). 
    
   The limitations of this model are that it requires interworking 
   across the OAM segments and does not conform to the OAM layering 
   principles, where each OAM layer ought to be independent of the 
   other. For end-to-end OAM determinations, the end-to-end service 
   frame path is not necessarily exercised. Further, it requires 
   interworking function implementation for all possible technologies 
   across access and core that may be used to realize end-to-end 
   services.

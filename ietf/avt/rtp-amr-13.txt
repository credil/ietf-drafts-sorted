This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP)
payload format to be used for Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and
Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) encoded speech
signals.  The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate
with existing AMR and AMR-WB transport formats on non-IP
networks.  In addition, a file format is specified for transport of
AMR and AMR-WB speech data in storage mode applications such as
email.  Two separate MIME type registrations are included, one for
AMR and one for AMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP payload
format and the storage format.

This document is a product of the Audio/Video Transport Working Group
of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution

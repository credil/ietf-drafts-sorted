   formats for carrying each of MPEG-4 Audio and MPEG-4 Visual
   bitstreams without using MPEG-4 Systems.  For the purpose of directly
   mapping MPEG-4 Audio/Visual bitstreams onto RTP packets, it provides
   specifications for the use of RTP header fields and also specifies
   fragmentation rules.  It also provides specifications for Media Type
   registration and the use of Session Description Protocol (SDP).

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


1.  Introduction

   The RTP payload formats described in this document specify how MPEG-4
   Audio [14496-3] and MPEG-4 Visual streams [14496-2] are to be
   fragmented and mapped directly onto RTP packets.

   These RTP payload formats enable transport of MPEG-4 Audio/Visual
   streams without using the synchronization and stream management
   functionality of MPEG-4 Systems [14496-1].  Such RTP payload formats
   will be used in systems that have intrinsic stream management
   functionality and thus require no such functionality from MPEG-4
   Systems.  H.323 terminals are an example of such systems, where
   MPEG-4 Audio/Visual streams are not managed by MPEG-4 Systems Object
   Descriptors but by H.245.  The streams are directly mapped onto RTP
   packets without using the MPEG-4 Systems Sync Layer.  Other examples
   are SIP and RTSP where Media Type and SDP are used.  Media Type and
   SDP usages of the RTP payload formats described in this document are
   defined to directly specify the attribute of Audio/Visual streams
   (e.g., media type, packetization format and codec configuration)
   without using MPEG-4 Systems.  The obvious benefit is that these
   MPEG-4 Audio/Visual RTP payload formats can be handled in an unified
   way together with those formats defined for non-MPEG-4 codecs.  The
   disadvantage is that interoperability with environments using MPEG-4
   Systems may be difficult, hence, other payload formats may be better
   suited to those applications.

   The semantics of RTP headers in such cases need to be clearly
   defined, including the association with MPEG-4 Audio/Visual data
   elements.  In addition, it is beneficial to define the fragmentation
   rules of RTP packets for MPEG-4 Video streams so as to enhance error
   resiliency by utilizing the error resilience tools provided inside
   the MPEG-4 Video stream.

1.1.  MPEG-4 Visual RTP payload format

   MPEG-4 Visual is a visual coding standard with many new features:
   high coding efficiency; high error resiliency; multiple, arbitrary
   shape object-based coding; etc. [14496-2].  It covers a wide range of
   bitrate from scores of Kbps to several Mbps.  It also covers a wide
   variety of networks, ranging from those guaranteed to be almost
   error-free to mobile networks with high error rates.

   With respect to the fragmentation rules for an MPEG-4 Visual
   bitstream defined in this document, since MPEG-4 Visual is used for a
   wide variety of networks, it is desirable not to apply too much
   restriction on fragmentation, and a fragmentation rule such as "a
   single video packet shall always be mapped on a single RTP packet"
   may be inappropriate.  On the other hand, careless, media unaware



Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


   fragmentation may cause degradation in error resiliency and bandwidth
   efficiency.  The fragmentation rules described in this document are
   flexible but manage to define the minimum rules for preventing
   meaningless fragmentation while utilizing the error resilience
   functionalities of MPEG-4 Visual.

   The fragmentation rule recommends not to map more than one VOP in an
   RTP packet so that the RTP timestamp uniquely indicates the VOP time
   framing.  On the other hand, MPEG-4 video may generate VOPs of very
   small size, in cases with an empty VOP (vop_coded=0) containing only
   VOP header or an arbitrary shaped VOP with a small number of coding
   blocks.  To reduce the overhead for such cases, the fragmentation
   rule permits concatenating multiple VOPs in an RTP packet.  (See
   fragmentation rule (4) in section 3.2 and marker bit and timestamp in
   section 3.1.)

   While the additional media specific RTP header defined for such video
   coding tools as H.261 or MPEG-1/2 is effective in helping to recover
   picture headers corrupted by packet losses, MPEG-4 Visual has already
   error resilience functionalities for recovering corrupt headers, and
   these can be used on RTP/IP networks as well as on other networks
   (H.223/mobile, MPEG-2/TS, etc.).  Therefore, no extra RTP header
   fields are defined in this MPEG-4 Visual RTP payload format.

1.2.  MPEG-4 Audio RTP payload format

   MPEG-4 Audio is an audio standard that integrates many different
   types of audio coding tools.  Low-overhead MPEG-4 Audio Transport
   Multiplex (LATM) manages the sequences of audio data with relatively
   small overhead.  In audio-only applications, then, it is desirable
   for LATM-based MPEG-4 Audio bitstreams to be directly mapped onto RTP
   packets without using MPEG-4 Systems.

   While LATM has several multiplexing features as follows;

   o  Carrying configuration information with audio data,

   o  Concatenation of multiple audio frames in one audio stream,

   o  Multiplexing multiple objects (programs),

   o  Multiplexing scalable layers,

   in RTP transmission there is no need for the last two features.
   Therefore, these two features MUST NOT be used in applications based
   on RTP packetization specified by this document.  Since LATM has been
   developed for only natural audio coding tools, i.e., not for
   synthesis tools, it seems difficult to transmit Structured Audio (SA)



Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


   data and Text to Speech Interface (TTSI) data by LATM.  Therefore, SA
   data and TTSI data MUST NOT be transported by the RTP packetization
   in this document.

   For transmission of scalable streams, audio data of each layer SHOULD
   be packetized onto different RTP streams allowing for the different
   layers to be treated differently at the IP level, for example via
   some means of differentiated service.  On the other hand, all
   configuration data of the scalable streams are contained in one LATM
   configuration data "StreamMuxConfig" and every scalable layer shares
   the StreamMuxConfig.  The mapping between each layer and its
   configuration data is achieved by LATM header information attached to
   the audio data.  In order to indicate the dependency information of
   the scalable streams, the signaling mechanism as specified in
   [RFC5583] SHOULD be used (see section 4.2).

   For MPEG-4 Audio coding tools, as is true for other audio coders, if
   the payload is a single audio frame, packet loss will not impair the
   decodability of adjacent packets.  Therefore, the additional media
   specific header for recovering errors will not be required for MPEG-4
   Audio.  Existing RTP protection mechanisms, such as Generic Forward
   Error Correction (RFC 5109 [RFC5109]) and Redundant Audio Data (RFC
   2198 [RFC2198]), MAY be applied to improve error resiliency.

1.3.  Differences to RFC 3016

   The RTP payload format for MPEG-4 Audio as specified in RFC 3016 is
   used by the 3GPP PSS service [3GPP].  However, there are some
   misalignments between RFC 3016 and the 3GPP PSS specification that
   are addressed by this update:

   o  The audio payload format (LATM) referenced in RFC 3016 is binary
      incompatible to the format used in 3GPP.

   o  The audio signaling format (StreamMuxConfig) referenced in RFC
      3016 is binary incompatible to the format used in 3GPP.

   o  The audio parameter "SBR-enabled" is not defined within RFC 3016
      but used by 3GPP

   o  The rate parameter specification is ambiguous in the presence of
      SBR (Spectral Band Replication)

   o  The number of audio channel parameter specification is ambiguous
      in the presence of PS (Parametric Stereo)

   Furthermore some comments have been addressed and signaling support
   for MPEG surround [23003-1] was added.  It should be noted that the

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


   audio payload format described here has some known limitations.  For
   new system designs RFC 3640 [RFC3640] is recommended.


2.  Definitions and Abbreviations

   This memo makes use of terms, specified in [14496-2], [14496-3], and
   [23003-1].  In addition, the following terms are used in this
   document and have specific meaning within the context of this
   document.

   Core codec sampling rate:

      Audio codec sampling rate.  When SBR (Spectral Band Replication)
      is used, typically the double value of this will be regarded as
      the definitive sampling rate (i.e., the decoder's output sampling
      rate)

      Note: The exception is downsampled SBR mode in which the SBR
      sampling rate equals the core codec sampling rate.

   Core codec channel configuration:

      Audio codec channel configuration.  When PS (Parametric Stereo) is
      used, the core codec channel configuration indicates one channel
      (i.e., mono) whereas the definitive channel configuration is two
      channels (i.e. stereo).  When MPEG Surround is used, the
      definitive channel configuration depends on the output of the MPEG
      Surround decoder.

   SBR sampling rate:

      When SBR is used, typically the sampling rate is the double value
      of the core codec sampling rate, with the exception of downsampled
      SBR mode, where the SBR sampling rate and core codec sampling rate
      are identical.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  RTP Packetization of MPEG-4 Visual bitstream

   This section specifies RTP packetization rules for MPEG-4 Visual
   content.  An MPEG-4 Visual bitstream is mapped directly onto RTP
   packets without the addition of extra header fields or any removal of
   Visual syntax elements.  The Combined Configuration/Elementary stream
   mode MUST be used so that configuration information will be carried
   to the same RTP port as the elementary stream. (see 6.2.1 "Start
   codes" of ISO/IEC 14496-2 [14496-2]) The configuration information
   MAY additionally be specified by some out-of-band means.  If needed
   for an H.323 terminal, H.245 codepoint
   "decoderConfigurationInformation" MUST be used for this purpose.  If
   needed by systems using Media Type parameters and SDP parameters,
   e.g., SIP and RTSP, the optional parameter "config" MUST be used to
   specify the configuration information (see 5.1 and 5.2).

   When the short video header mode is used, the RTP payload format for
   H.263 SHOULD be used (the format defined in RFC 4629 [RFC4629] is
   RECOMMENDED, but the RFC 4628 [RFC4628] format MAY be used for
   compatibility with older implementations).

     Figure 1 - An RTP packet for MPEG-4 Visual stream

3.1.  Use of RTP header fields for MPEG-4 Visual

   Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this
   packet format is outside the scope of this document, and will not be
   specified here.  It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular
   class of applications will assign a payload type for this encoding,
   or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range SHALL
   be chosen by means of an out-of-band signaling protocol (e.g., H.245,
   SIP, etc).

   Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used.

   Sequence Number: Incremented by one for each RTP data packet sent,
   starting, for security reasons, with a random initial value.

   Marker (M) bit: The marker bit is set to one to indicate the last RTP
   packet (or only RTP packet) of a VOP.  When multiple VOPs are carried
   in the same RTP packet, the marker bit is set to one.

   Timestamp: The timestamp indicates the sampling instance of the VOP
   contained in the RTP packet.  A constant offset, which is random, is
   added for security reasons.

   o  When multiple VOPs are carried in the same RTP packet, the
      timestamp indicates the earliest of the VOP times within the VOPs
      carried in the RTP packet.  Timestamp information of the rest of
      the VOPs are derived from the timestamp fields in the VOP header

      (modulo_time_base and vop_time_increment).

   o  If the RTP packet contains only configuration information and/or
      Group_of_VideoObjectPlane() fields, the timestamp of the next VOP
      in the coding order is used.

   o  If the RTP packet contains only visual_object_sequence_end_code
      information, the timestamp of the immediately preceding VOP in the
      coding order is used.

   The resolution of the timestamp is set to its default value of 90kHz,
   unless specified by an out-of-band means (e.g., SDP parameter or
   Media Type parameter as defined in section 5).

   Other header fields are used as described in RFC 3550 [RFC3550].

3.2.  Fragmentation of MPEG-4 Visual bitstream

   A fragmented MPEG-4 Visual bitstream is mapped directly onto the RTP
   payload without any addition of extra header fields or any removal of
   Visual syntax elements.  The Combined Configuration/Elementary
   streams mode is used.  The following rules apply for the
   fragmentation.

   In the following, header means one of the following:

   o  Configuration information (Visual Object Sequence Header, Visual
      Object Header and Video Object Layer Header)

   o  visual_object_sequence_end_code

   o  The header of the entry point function for an elementary stream
      (Group_of_VideoObjectPlane() or the header of VideoObjectPlane(),
      video_plane_with_short_header(), MeshObject() or FaceObject())

   o  The video packet header (video_packet_header() excluding
      next_resync_marker())

   o  The header of gob_layer()

   o  See 6.2.1 "Start codes" of ISO/IEC 14496-2 [14496-2] for the
      definition of the configuration information and the entry point
      functions.

   (1) Configuration information and Group_of_VideoObjectPlane() fields
   SHALL be placed at the beginning of the RTP payload (just after the
   RTP header) or just after the header of the syntactically upper layer
   function.

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


   (2) If one or more headers exist in the RTP payload, the RTP payload
   SHALL begin with the header of the syntactically highest function.
   Note: The visual_object_sequence_end_code is regarded as the lowest
   function.

   (3) A header SHALL NOT be split into a plurality of RTP packets.

   (4) Different VOPs SHOULD be fragmented into different RTP packets so
   that one RTP packet consists of the data bytes associated with a
   unique VOP time instance (that is indicated in the timestamp field in
   the RTP packet header), with the exception that multiple consecutive
   VOPs MAY be carried within one RTP packet in the decoding order if
   the size of the VOPs is small.

   Note: When multiple VOPs are carried in one RTP payload, the
   timestamp of the VOPs after the first one may be calculated by the
   decoder.  This operation is necessary only for RTP packets in which
   the marker bit equals to one and the beginning of RTP payload
   corresponds to a start code.  (See timestamp and marker bit in
   section 3.1.)

   (5) It is RECOMMENDED that a single video packet is sent as a single
   RTP packet.  The size of a video packet SHOULD be adjusted in such a
   way that the resulting RTP packet is not larger than the path-MTU.
   Note: Rule (5) does not apply when the video packet is disabled by
   the coder configuration (by setting resync_marker_disable in the VOL
   header to 1), or in coding tools where the video packet is not
   supported.  In this case, a VOP MAY be split at arbitrary byte-
   positions.

   The video packet starts with the VOP header or the video packet
   header, followed by motion_shape_texture(), and ends with
   next_resync_marker() or next_start_code().

3.3.  Examples of packetized MPEG-4 Visual bitstream

   Figure 2 shows examples of RTP packets generated based on the
   criteria described in 3.2

   (a) is an example of the first RTP packet or the random access point
   of an MPEG-4 Visual bitstream containing the configuration
   information.  According to criterion (1), the Visual Object Sequence
   Header(VS header) is placed at the beginning of the RTP payload,
   preceding the Visual Object Header and the Video Object Layer
   Header(VO header, VOL header).  Since the fragmentation rule defined
   in 3.2 guarantees that the configuration information, starting with
   visual_object_sequence_start_code, is always placed at the beginning
   of the RTP payload, RTP receivers can detect the random access point



Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


   by checking if the first 32-bit field of the RTP payload is
   visual_object_sequence_start_code.

   (b) is another example of the RTP packet containing the configuration
   information.  It differs from example (a) in that the RTP packet also
   contains a video packet in the VOP following the configuration
   information.  Since the length of the configuration information is
   relatively short (typically scores of bytes) and an RTP packet
   containing only the configuration information may thus increase the
   overhead, the configuration information and the immediately following
   GOV and/or (a part of) VOP can be packetized into a single RTP packet
   as in this example.

   (c) is an example of an RTP packet that contains
   Group_of_VideoObjectPlane(GOV).  Following criterion (1), the GOV is
   placed at the beginning of the RTP payload.  It would be a waste of
   RTP/IP header overhead to generate an RTP packet containing only a
   GOV whose length is 7 bytes.  Therefore, (a part of) the following
   VOP can be placed in the same RTP packet as shown in (c).

   (d) is an example of the case where one video packet is packetized
   into one RTP packet.  When the packet-loss rate of the underlying
   network is high, this kind of packetization is recommended.  Even
   when the RTP packet containing the VOP header is discarded by a
   packet loss, the other RTP packets can be decoded by using the
   HEC(Header Extension Code) information in the video packet header.
   No extra RTP header field is necessary.

   (e) is an example of the case where more than one video packet is
   packetized into one RTP packet.  This kind of packetization is
   effective to save the overhead of RTP/IP headers when the bit-rate of
   the underlying network is low.  However, it will decrease the packet-
   loss resiliency because multiple video packets are discarded by a
   single RTP packet loss.  The optimal number of video packets in an
   RTP packet and the length of the RTP packet can be determined
   considering the packet-loss rate and the bit-rate of the underlying
   network.

   (f) is an example of the case when the video packet is disabled by
   setting resync_marker_disable in the VOL header to 1.  In this case,
   a VOP may be split into a plurality of RTP packets at arbitrary byte-
   positions.  For example, it is possible to split a VOP into fixed-
   length packets.  This kind of coder configuration and RTP packet
   fragmentation may be used when the underlying network is guaranteed
   to be error-free.  On the other hand, it is not recommended to use it
   in error-prone environment since it provides only poor packet loss
   resiliency.

   Figure 3 shows examples of RTP packets prohibited by the criteria of
   3.2.

   Fragmentation of a header into multiple RTP packets, as in (a), will
   not only increase the overhead of RTP/IP headers but also decrease
   the error resiliency.  Therefore, it is prohibited by the criterion
   (3).

   When concatenating more than one video packets into an RTP packet,
   VOP header or video_packet_header() shall not be placed in the middle
   of the RTP payload.  The packetization as in (b) is not allowed by
   criterion (2) due to the aspect of the error resiliency.  Comparing
   this example with Figure 2(d), although two video packets are mapped
   onto two RTP packets in both cases, the packet-loss resiliency is not
   identical.  Namely, if the second RTP packet is lost, both video
   packets 1 and 2 are lost in the case of Figure 3(b) whereas only
   video packet 2 is lost in the case of Figure 2(d).

4.  RTP Packetization of MPEG-4 Audio bitstream

   This section specifies RTP packetization rules for MPEG-4 Audio
   bitstreams.  MPEG-4 Audio streams MUST be formatted LATM (Low-
   overhead MPEG-4 Audio Transport Multiplex) [14496-3] streams, and the
   LATM-based streams are then mapped onto RTP packets as described in
   the sections below.

4.1.  RTP Packet Format

   LATM-based streams consist of a sequence of audioMuxElements that
   include one or more PayloadMux elements which carry the audio frames.
   A complete audioMuxElement or a part of one SHALL be mapped directly
   onto an RTP payload without any removal of audioMuxElement syntax
   elements (see Figure 4).  The first byte of each audioMuxElement
   SHALL be located at the first payload location in an RTP packet.

             Figure 4 - An RTP packet for MPEG-4 Audio

   In order to decode the audioMuxElement, the following
   muxConfigPresent information is required to be indicated by out-of-
   band means.  When SDP is utilized for this indication, the Media Type
   parameter "cpresent" corresponds to the muxConfigPresent information
   (see section 5.3).  The following restrictions apply:

   o  In the out-of-band configuration case the number of PayloadMux
      elements contained in each audioMuxElement can only be set once.
      If values greater than one PayloadMux Element are used, special
      care is required to ensure that the last RTP packet remains



Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


      decodable.

   o  In the in-band configuration case the audio frames are in general
      not byte aligned.  Hinting RTP payload from MP4 file format
      [14496-12] [14496-14] is therefore not possible.

   muxConfigPresent: If this value is set to 1 (in-band mode), the
   audioMuxElement SHALL include an indication bit "useSameStreamMux"
   and MAY include the configuration information for audio compression
   "StreamMuxConfig".  The useSameStreamMux bit indicates whether the
   StreamMuxConfig element in the previous frame is applied in the
   current frame.  If the useSameStreamMux bit indicates to use the
   StreamMuxConfig from the previous frame, but if the previous frame
   has been lost, the current frame may not be decodable.  Therefore, in
   case of in-band mode, the StreamMuxConfig element SHOULD be
   transmitted repeatedly depending on the network condition.  On the
   other hand, if muxConfigPresent is set to 0 (out-band mode), the
   StreamMuxConfig element is required to be transmitted by an out-of-
   band means.  In case of SDP, Media Type parameter "config" is
   utilized (see section 5.3).

4.2.  Use of RTP Header Fields for MPEG-4 Audio

   Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new
   packet format is outside the scope of this document, and will not be
   specified here.  It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular
   class of applications will assign a payload type for this encoding,
   or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range shall
   be chosen by means of an out-of-band signaling protocol (e.g., H.245,
   SIP, etc).  In the dynamic assignment of RTP payload types for
   scalable streams, a different value SHOULD be assigned to each layer.
   The dependency relationships between the enhance layer and the base
   layer SHOULD be signaled as specified in [RFC5583].  An example of
   the use of such signaling for scalable audio streams can be found in
   [RFC5691].

   Marker (M) bit: The marker bit indicates audioMuxElement boundaries.
   It is set to one to indicate that the RTP packet contains a complete
   audioMuxElement or the last fragment of an audioMuxElement.

   Timestamp: The timestamp indicates the sampling instance of the first
   audio frame contained in the RTP packet.  Timestamps are recommended
   to start at a random value for security reasons.

   Unless specified by an out-of-band means, the resolution of the
   timestamp is set to its default value of 90 kHz.

   Sequence Number: Incremented by one for each RTP packet sent,



Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


   starting, for security reasons, with a random value.

   Other header fields are used as described in RFC 3550 [RFC3550].

4.3.  Fragmentation of MPEG-4 Audio bitstream

   It is RECOMMENDED to put one audioMuxElement in each RTP packet.  If
   the size of an audioMuxElement can be kept small enough that the size
   of the RTP packet containing it does not exceed the size of the path-
   MTU, this will be no problem.  If it cannot, the audioMuxElement MAY
   be fragmented and spread across multiple packets.


5.  Media Type registration for MPEG-4 Audio/Visual streams

   The following sections describe the Media Type registrations for
   MPEG-4 Audio/Visual streams.  Media Type registration and SDP usage
   for the MPEG-4 Visual stream are described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2,
   respectively, while Media Type registration and SDP usage for MPEG-4
   Audio stream are described in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, respectively.

5.1.  Media Type registration for MPEG-4 Visual

   Media type name: video

   Media subtype name: MP4V-ES

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:

      rate: This parameter is used only for RTP transport.  It indicates
      the resolution of the timestamp field in the RTP header.  If this
      parameter is not specified, its default value of 90000 (90kHz) is
      used.

      profile-level-id: A decimal representation of MPEG-4 Visual
      Profile and Level indication value (profile_and_level_indication)
      defined in Table G-1 of ISO/IEC 14496-2 [14496-2].  This parameter
      MAY be used in the capability exchange or session setup procedure
      to indicate MPEG-4 Visual Profile and Level combination of which
      the MPEG-4 Visual codec is capable.  If this parameter is not
      specified by the procedure, its default value of 1 (Simple
      Profile/Level 1) is used.

      config: This parameter SHALL be used to indicate the configuration
      of the corresponding MPEG-4 Visual bitstream.  It SHALL NOT be
      used to indicate the codec capability in the capability exchange



Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


      procedure.  It is a hexadecimal representation of an octet string
      that expresses the MPEG-4 Visual configuration information, as
      defined in subclause 6.2.1 Start codes of ISO/IEC14496-2
      [14496-2].  The configuration information is mapped onto the octet
      string in an MSB-first basis.  The first bit of the configuration
      information SHALL be located at the MSB of the first octet.  The
      configuration information indicated by this parameter SHALL be the
      same as the configuration information in the corresponding MPEG-4
      Visual stream, except for first_half_vbv_occupancy and
      latter_half_vbv_occupancy, if exist, which may vary in the
      repeated configuration information inside an MPEG-4 Visual stream
      (See 6.2.1 Start codes of ISO/IEC14496-2).

      Example usages for these parameters are:

      *  MPEG-4 Visual Simple Profile/Level 1: Content-type: video/
         mp4v-es; profile-level-id=1

      *  MPEG-4 Visual Core Profile/Level 2: Content-type: video/
         mp4v-es; profile-level-id=34

      *  MPEG-4 Visual Advanced Real Time Simple Profile/Level 1:
         Content-type: video/mp4v-es; profile-level-id=145

   Published specification:

      The specifications for MPEG-4 Visual streams are presented in ISO/
      IEC 14469-2 [14496-2].  The RTP payload format is described in RFC
      3016.

   Encoding considerations:

      Video bitstreams MUST be generated according to MPEG-4 Visual
      specifications (ISO/IEC 14496-2).  A video bitstream is binary
      data and MUST be encoded for non-binary transport (for Email, the
      Base64 encoding is sufficient).  This type is also defined for
      transfer via RTP.  The RTP packets MUST be packetized according to
      the MPEG-4 Visual RTP payload format defined in RFC 3016.

   Security considerations:

      See section 7 of RFC 3016.

   Interoperability considerations:

      MPEG-4 Visual provides a large and rich set of tools for the
      coding of visual objects.  For effective implementation of the
      standard, subsets of the MPEG-4 Visual tool sets have been



Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


      provided for use in specific applications.  These subsets, called
      'Profiles', limit the size of the tool set a decoder is required
      to implement.  In order to restrict computational complexity, one
      or more Levels are set for each Profile.  A Profile@Level
      combination allows:

      *  a codec builder to implement only the subset of the standard he
         needs, while maintaining interworking with other MPEG-4 devices
         included in the same combination, and

      *  checking whether MPEG-4 devices comply with the standard
         ('conformance testing').

      The visual stream SHALL be compliant with the MPEG-4 Visual
      Profile@Level specified by the parameter "profile-level-id".
      Interoperability between a sender and a receiver may be achieved
      by specifying the parameter "profile-level-id", or by arranging in
      the capability exchange/announcement procedure to set this
      parameter mutually to the same value.

   Applications which use this Media Type:

      Audio and visual streaming and conferencing tools

   Additional information: none

      See Authors' Address section at the end of this document.

   Intended usage: COMMON

      See Authors' Address section at the end of this document.

5.2.  SDP usage of MPEG-4 Visual

   The Media Type video/MP4V-ES string is mapped to fields in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566], as follows:

   o  The Media Type (video) goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The Media subtype (MP4V-ES) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
      name.

   o  The optional parameter "rate" goes in "a=rtpmap" as the clock
      rate.



Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


   o  The optional parameter "profile-level-id" and "config" go in the
      "a=fmtp" line to indicate the coder capability and configuration,
      respectively.  These parameters are expressed as a string, in the
      form of as a semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   The following are some examples of media representation in SDP:


Simple Profile/Level 1, rate=90000(90kHz), "profile-level-id" and
"config" are present in "a=fmtp" line:
  m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 98
  a=rtpmap:98 MP4V-ES/90000
  a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=1;config=000001B001000001B50900000100000001
     20008440FA282C2090A21F

Core Profile/Level 2, rate=90000(90kHz), "profile-level-id" is present
in "a=fmtp" line:
  m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 98
  a=rtpmap:98 MP4V-ES/90000
  a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=34

Advance Real Time Simple Profile/Level 1, rate=90000(90kHz),
"profile-level-id" is present in "a=fmtp" line:
  m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP 98
  a=rtpmap:98 MP4V-ES/90000
  a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=145

5.3.  Media Type registration of MPEG-4 Audio

   Media type name: audio

   Media subtype name: MP4A-LATM

   Required parameters:

      rate: the rate parameter indicates the RTP time stamp clock rate.
      The default value is 90000.  Other rates MAY be specified only if
      they are set to the same value as the audio sampling rate (number
      of samples per second).

      In the presence of SBR, the sampling rates for the core en-/
      decoder and the SBR tool are different in most cases.  This
      parameter shall therefore not be considered as the definitive
      sampling rate.  If this parameter is used, the server must
      following the rules below:

      *  When the presence of SBR is not explicitly signaled by the
         optional SDP parameters such as object parameter, profile-



Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


         level-id or config string, this parameter shall be set to the
         core codec sampling rate.

      *  When the presence of SBR is explicitly signaled by the optional
         SDP parameters such as object parameter, profile-level-id or
         config string this parameter shall be set to the SBR sampling
         rate.

      NOTE: The optional parameter SBR-enabled in SDP a=fmtp is useful
      for implicit HE AAC / HE AAC v2 signaling.  But the SBR-enabled
      parameter can also be used in the case of explicit HE AAC / HE AAC
      v2 signaling.  Therefore, its existence itself is not the criteria
      to determine whether HE AAC / HE AAC v2 signaling is explicit or
      not.

   Optional parameters:

      profile-level-id: a decimal representation of MPEG-4 Audio Profile
      Level indication value defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3 [14496-3].  This
      parameter indicates which MPEG-4 Audio tool subsets the decoder is
      capable of using.  If this parameter is not specified in the
      capability exchange or session setup procedure, its default value
      of 30 (Natural Audio Profile/Level 1) is used.



      Followings are some examples of this value:
      1 : Main Audio Profile Level 1
      9 : Speech Audio Profile Level 1
      15: High Quality Audio Profile Level 2
      30: Natural Audio Profile Level 1

      55: Baseline MPEG Surround Profile (see ISO/IEC 23003-1) Level 3

      MPS-profile-level-id: a decimal representation of the MPEG
      Surround Profile Level indication as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3
      [14496-3].  This parameter indicates the MPEG Surround profile and
      level that the decoder must be capable in order to decode the
      stream.

      object: a decimal representation of the MPEG-4 Audio Object Type
      value defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3 [14496-3].  This parameter
      specifies the tool to be used by the coder.  It CAN be used to
      limit the capability within the specified "profile-level-id".

      bitrate: the data rate for the audio bit stream.

      cpresent: a boolean parameter indicates whether audio payload
      configuration data has been multiplexed into an RTP payload (see
      section 4.1).  A 0 indicates the configuration data has not been
      multiplexed into an RTP payload, a 1 indicates that it has.  The
      default if the parameter is omitted is 1.

      config: a hexadecimal representation of an octet string that
      expresses the audio payload configuration data "StreamMuxConfig",
      as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3 [14496-3].  Configuration data is
      mapped onto the octet string in an MSB-first basis.  The first bit
      of the configuration data SHALL be located at the MSB of the first
      octet.  In the last octet, zero-padding bits, if necessary, SHALL
      follow the configuration data.  Senders MUST set the
      StreamMuxConfig elements taraBufferFullness and latmBufferFullness
      to their largest respective value, indicating that buffer fullness
      measures are not used in SDP.  Receivers MUST ignore the value of
      these two elements contained in the config parameter.

      MPS-asc: a hexadecimal representation of an octet string that
      expresses audio payload configuration data "AudioSpecificConfig",
      as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3 [14496-3].  If this parameter is not
      present the relevant signaling is performed by other means (e.g.
      in-band or contained in the config string).

      The same mapping rules as for the config parameter apply.

      ptime: RECOMMENDED duration of each packet in milliseconds.

      SBR-enabled: a boolean parameter which indicates whether SBR-data
      can be expected in the RTP-payload of a stream.  This parameter is
      relevant for an SBR-capable decoder if the presence of SBR can not
      be detected from an out-of-band decoder configuration (e.g.
      contained in the config string).

      If this parameter is set to 0, a decoder SHALL expect that SBR is
      not used.  If this parameter is set to 1, a decoder SHOULD
      upsample the audio data with the SBR tool, regardless whether SBR
      data is present in the stream or not.

      If the presence of SBR can not be detected from out-of-band
      configuration and the SBR-enabled parameter is not present, the
      parameter defaults to 1 for an SBR-capable decoder.  If the
      resulting output sampling rate or the computational complexity is
      not supported, the SBR tool may be disabled or run in downsampled
      mode.

      The timestamp resolution at RTP layer is determined by the rate
      parameter.

   Published specification:

      Payload format specifications are described in this document.
      Encoding specifications are provided in ISO/IEC 14496-3 [14496-3].

   Encoding considerations:

      This type is only defined for transfer via RTP.

   Security considerations:

      See Section 7 of RFC 3016.

   Interoperability considerations:

      MPEG-4 Audio provides a large and rich set of tools for the coding
      of audio objects.  For effective implementation of the standard,
      subsets of the MPEG-4 Audio tool sets similar to those used in
      MPEG-4 Visual have been provided (see section 5.1).

      The audio stream SHALL be compliant with the MPEG-4 Audio Profile@
      Level specified by the parameters "profile-level-id" and "MPS-
      profile-level-id".  Interoperability between a sender and a
      receiver may be achieved by specifying the parameters "profile-
      level-id" and "MPS-profile-level-id", or by arranging in the
      capability exchange procedure to set this parameter mutually to
      the same value.  Furthermore, the "object" parameter can be used
      to limit the capability within the specified Profile@Level in
      capability exchange.

   Applications which use this media type:

      Audio and video streaming and conferencing tools.

5.4.  SDP usage of MPEG-4 Audio

   The Media Type audio/MP4A-LATM string is mapped to fields in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566], as follows:

   o  The Media Type (audio) goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The Media subtype (MP4A-LATM) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the
      encoding name.

   o  The required parameter "rate" goes in "a=rtpmap" as the clock
      rate.

   o  The optional parameter "ptime" goes in SDP "a=ptime" attribute.

   o  The optional parameters "profile-level-id" and
      "MPS-profile-level-id" goes in the "a=fmtp" line to indicate the
      coder capability.  The "object" parameter goes in the "a=fmtp"
      attribute.  The payload-format-specific parameters "bitrate",
      "cpresent", "config", "MPS-asc" and "SBR-enabled" go in the
      "a=fmtp" line.  These parameters are expressed as a string, in the
      form of as a semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   The following sections contain some examples of the media
   representation in SDP.

   Note that the a=fmtp line in some of the examples has been wrapped to
   fit the page; they would comprise a single line in the SDP file.

5.4.1.  Example: In-band configuration

   In this example the audio configuration data appears in the RTP
   payload exclusively (i.e., the MPEG-4 audio configuration is known
   when a StreamMuxConfig element appears within the RTP payload).

      m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
      a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/90000
      a=fmtp:96 object=2; cpresent=1

   The "clock rate" is set to 90kHz.  This is the default value and the
   real audio sampling rate is known when the audio configuration data
   is received.

5.4.2.  Example: 6kb/s CELP

   6 kb/s CELP bitstreams (with an audio sampling rate of 8 kHz)





Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/8000
     a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=9; object=8; cpresent=0;
       config=40008B18388380
     a=ptime:20

   In this example audio configuration data is not multiplexed into the
   RTP payload and is described only in SDP.  Furthermore, the "clock
   rate" is set to the audio sampling rate.

5.4.3.  Example: 64 kb/s AAC LC stereo

   64 kb/s AAC LC stereo bitstream (with an audio sampling rate of 24
   kHz)

     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/24000/2
     a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=1; bitrate=64000; cpresent=0;
       object=2; config=400026203fc0

   In this example audio configuration data is not multiplexed into the
   RTP payload and is described only in SDP.  Furthermore, the "clock
   rate" is set to the audio sampling rate.

   In this example, the presence of SBR can not be determined by the SDP
   parameter set.  The clock rate represents the core codec sampling
   rate.  An SBR enabled decoder SHOULD use the SBR tool to upsample the
   audio data if complexity and resulting output sampling rate permits.

5.4.4.  Example: Use of the SBR-enabled parameter

   These two examples are identical to the example above with the
   exception of the SBR-enabled parameter.  The presence of SBR is not
   signaled by the SDP parameters object, profile-level-id and config,
   but instead the SBR-enabled parameter is present.  The rate parameter
   and the StreamMuxConfig contain the core codec sampling rate.

   Example with "SBR-enabled=0", definitive and core codec sampling rate
   24kHz:

     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/24000/2
     a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=1; bitrate=64000; cpresent=0;
       SBR-enabled=0; config=400026203fc0

   Example with "SBR-enabled=1", core codec sampling rate 24kHz,
   definitive and SBR sampling rate 48kHz:




Schmidt, et al.          Expires October 4, 2010               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/24000/2
     a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=1; bitrate=64000; cpresent=0;
       SBR-enabled=1; config=400026203fc0

   In this example, the clock rate is still 24000 and this information
   should be used for RTP timestamp calculation.  The value of 24000 is
   used to support old AAC decoders.  This makes the decoder supporting
   only AAC understand the HE AAC coded data, although only plain AAC is
   supported.  A HE AAC decoder is able to generate output data with the
   SBR sampling rate.

5.4.5.  Example: Hierarchical Signaling of SBR

   When the presence of SBR is explicitly signaled by the SDP parameters
   object, profile-level-id or the config string as in the example
   below, the StreamMuxConfig contains both the core codec sampling rate
   and the SBR sampling rate.

     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/48000/2
     a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=44; bitrate=64000; cpresent=0;
       config=40005623101fe0; SBR-enabled=1

   This config string uses the explicit signaling mode 2.A (hierarchical
   signaling; See ISO/IEC 14496-3 [14496-3]).  This means that the
   AOT(Audio Object Type) is SBR(5) and SFI(Sampling Frequency Index) is
   6(24000 Hz) which refers to the underlying core codec sampling
   frequency.  CC(Channel Configuration) is stereo(2), and the
   ESFI(Extension Sampling Frequency Index)=3 (48000) is referring to
   the sampling frequency of the extension tool(SBR).

5.4.6.  Example: HE AAC v2 Signaling

   HE AAC v2 decoders are required to always produce a stereo signal
   from a mono signal.  Hence, there is no parameter necessary to signal
   the presence of PS.

   Example with "SBR-enabled=1" and 1 channel signaled in the a=rtpmap
   line and within the config parameter.  Core codec sampling rate is
   24kHz, definitive and SBR sampling rate is 48kHz.  Core codec channel
   configuration is mono, PS channel configuration is stereo.

     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 110
     a=rtpmap:110 MP4A-LATM/24000/1
     a=fmtp:110 profile-level-id=15; object=2; cpresent=0;
       config=400026103fc0; SBR-enabled=1

Internet-Draft    RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Streams       April 2010


5.4.7.  Example: Hierarchical Signaling of PS

   Example: 48khz stereo audio input:

     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 110
     a=rtpmap:110 MP4A-LATM/48000/2
     a=fmtp:110 profile-level-id=48; cpresent=0; config=4001d613101fe0

   The config parameter indicates explicit hierarchical signaling of PS
   and SBR.  This configuration method is not supported by legacy AAC an
   HE AAC decoders and these are therefore unable to decode the the
   coded data.

5.4.8.  Example: MPEG Surround

   The following examples show how MPEG Surround configuration data can
   be signaled using SDP.  The configuration is carried within the
   config string in the first example by using two different layers.
   The general parameters in this example are: AudioMuxVersion=1;
   allStreamsSameTimeFraming=1; numSubFrames=0; numProgram=0;
   numLayer=1.  The first layer describes the HE AAC payload and signals
   the following parameters: ascLen=25; audioObjectType=2 (AAC LC);
   extensionAudioObjectType=5 (SBR); samplingFrequencyIndex=6 (24kHz);
   extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex=3 (48kHz); channelConfiguration=2
   (2.0 channels).  The second layer describes the MPEG surround payload
   and specifies the following parameters: ascLen=110;
   AudioObjectType=30 (MPEG Surround); samplingFrequencyIndex=3 (48kHz);
   channelConfiguration=6 (5.1 channels); sacPayloadEmbedding=1;
   SpatialSpecificConfig=(48 kHz; 32 slots; 525 tree; ResCoding=1;
   ResBands=[7,7,7,7]).

   In this example the signaling is carried by using two different LATM
   layers.  The MPEG surround payload is carried together with the AAC
   payload in a single layer as indicated by the sacPayloadEmbedding
   Flag.

     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/48000
     a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=1; bitrate=64000; cpresent=0;
       SBR-enabled=1;
       config=8FF8004192B11880FF0DDE3699F2408C00536C02313CF3CE0FF0

5.4.9.  Example: MPEG Surround with extended SDP parameters

   The following example is an extension of the configuration given
   above by the MPEG Surround specific parameters.  The MPS-asc
   parameter specifies the MPEG Surround Baseline Profile at Level 3
   (PLI55) and the MPS-asc string contains the hexadecimal

   representation of the MPEG Surround ASC [audioObjectType=30 (MPEG
   Surround); samplingFrequencyIndex=0x3 (48kHz); channelConfiguration=6
   (5.1 channels); sacPayloadEmbedding=1; SpatialSpecificConfig=(48 kHz;
   32 slots; 525 tree; ResCoding=1; ResBands=[0,13,13,13])].

     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/48000
     a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=44; bitrate=64000; cpresent=0;
       config=40005623101fe0; MPS-profile-level-id=55;
       MPS-asc=F1B4CF920442029B501185B6DA00;

5.4.10.  Example: MPEG Surround with single layer configuration

   The following example shows how MPEG Surround configuration data can
   be signaled using the SDP config parameter.  The configuration is
   carried within the config string using a single layer.  The general
   parameters in this example are: AudioMuxVersion=1;
   allStreamsSameTimeFraming=1; numSubFrames=0; numProgram=0;
   numLayer=0.  The single layer describes the combination of HE AAC and
   MPEG Surround payload and signals the following parameters:
   ascLen=101; audioObjectType=2 (AAC LC); extensionAudioObjectType=5
   (SBR); samplingFrequencyIndex=7 (22.05kHz);
   extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex=7 (44.1kHz); channelConfiguration=2
   (2.0 channels).  A backward compatible extension according to
   [14496-3/Amd.1] signals the presence of MPEG surround payload data
   and specifies the following parameters: SpatialSpecificConfig=(44.1
   kHz; 32 slots; 525 tree; ResCoding=0).

   In this example the signaling is carried by using a single LATM
   layer.  The MPEG surround payload is carried together with the HE AAC
   payload in a single layer.

     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 96
     a=rtpmap:96 MP4A-LATM/44100
     a=fmtp:96 profile-level-id=44; bitrate=64000; cpresent=0;

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo defines additional optional format parameters to the Media
   Type "audio" and its subtype "MP4A-LATM", as defined in RFC 3016
   [RFC3016].  The Media Type parameters are defined in sections 5.1 and
   5.3.

6.1.  Media Type Registration

   This memo defines the following additional optional parameters which
   SHOULD be used if SBR or MPEG Surround data is present inside the
   payload of an AAC elementary stream.

      MPS-profile-level-id: a decimal representation of the MPEG
      Surround Profile Level indication as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3
      [14496-3].  This parameter indicates the MPEG Surround profile and
      level that the decoder must be capable in order to decode the
      stream.

      MPS-asc: a hexadecimal representation of an octet string that
      expresses audio payload configuration data "AudioSpecificConfig",
      as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3 [14496-3].  If this parameter is not
      present the relevant signaling is performed by other means (e.g.
      in-band or contained in the config string).

      SBR-enabled: a boolean parameter which indicates whether SBR-data
      can be expected in the RTP-payload of a stream.  This parameter is
      relevant for an SBR-capable decoder if the presence of SBR can not
      be detected from an out-of-band decoder configuration (e.g.
      contained in the config string).

6.2.  Usage of SDP

   It is assumed that the Media Type parameters are conveyed via an SDP
   message as specified in RFC 3016 [RFC3016], sections 5.2 and 5.4.


7.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550].  This implies that confidentiality of the
   media streams is achieved by encryption.  Because the data
   compression used with this payload format is applied end-to-end,
   encryption may be performed on the compressed data so there is no
   conflict between the two operations.

   The complete MPEG-4 system allows for transport of a wide range of
   content, including Java applets (MPEG-J) and scripts.  Since this
   payload format is restricted to audio and video streams, it is not
   possible to transport such active content in this format.

   Most MPEG-4 codecs define an extension mechanism to transmit extra
   data within a stream that is gracefully skipped by decoders that do
   not support this extra data.  This covert channel may be used to

   transmit unwanted data in an otherwise valid stream and it is hence
   recommended to use SRTP [RFC3711] for stream encryption,
   authentication, and integrity check.

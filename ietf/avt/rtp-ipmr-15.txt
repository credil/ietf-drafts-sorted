Internet-Draft RTP Payload Format for IP-MR Speech CodecJanuary 11, 2011


1. Introduction

   This document specifies the payload format for packetization of
   SPIRIT IP-MR encoded speech signals into the real-time transport
   protocol (RTP). The payload format supports transmission of multiple
   frames per packet and introduced redundancy for robustness against
   packet loss and bit errors.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 2119].

2. IP-MR Codec Description

   IP-MR is a wideband speech codec designed by SPIRIT for conferencing
   services over packet-switched networks such as the Internet.

   IP-MR is a scalable codec. It means that not only source has the
   ability to change transmission rate on a fly, but the gateway is also
   able to decrease bandwidth at any time without performance overhead.
   There are 6 coding rates from 7.7 to 34.2 kbps available.

   Codec operates on a frame-by-frame basis with a frame size of 20 ms
   at 16 kHz sampling rate with the total end-to-end delay of 25ms. Each
   compressed frame represented as a sequence of layers. The first
   (base) layer is mandatory while the other (enhancement) can be safely
   discarded. Information about particular frame structure is available
   from the payload header. In order to adjust outgoing bandwidth the
   gateway MUST read frame(s) structure from the payload header, define
   which enhancement layers to discard and compose new RTP packet
   according to this specification.

   In fact, not all of bits within a frame are equally tolerant to
   distortion. IP-MR defines 6 classes ('A'-'F') of sensitivity to bit
   errors. Any damage of class 'A' bits cause significant reconstruction
   artifacts while the loss in class 'F' may be even not perceived by
   the listener. Note, only base layer in a bitstream is represented as
   a set of classes.

   The IP-MR payload format allows frame duplicate through the packets
   to improve robustness against packet loss (Section 3.6). Base layer
   can be retransmitted completely or in several sensitive classes.
   Enchantment layers are not retransmittable.

   The fine-grained redundancy in conjunction with bitrate scalability
   allows application adjust the trade-off between overhead and
   robustness against packet loss. Note, this approach supported
   natively within a packet and requires no out-of-band signals or

   session initialization procedures.

   Main IP-MR features are as the following:

      o High quality wideband speech codec.

      o Bitrate scalable with 6 average rates from 7.7 to 34.2 kbps.

      o Built-in discontinuous transmission (DTX) and comfort noise
      generation (CNG) support.

      o Flexible in-band redundancy control scheme for packet loss
      protection.

3. Payload Format

   The payload format consists of the RTP header, and IP-MR payload.

3.1. RTP Header Usage

   The format of the RTP header is specified in RFC 1889. This payload
   format uses the fields of the header in a manner consistent with that
   specification.

   The RTP timestamp corresponds to the sampling instant of the first
   sample encoded for the first frame-block in the packet. The timestamp
   clock frequency SHALL be 16 kHz. The duration of one frame is 20 ms,
   this corresponding to 320 samples per frame. Thus the timestamp is
   increased by 320 for each consecutive frame. The timestamp is also
   used to recover the correct decoding order of the frame-blocks.

   The RTP header marker bit (M) SHALL be set to 1 whenever the first
   frame-block carried in the packet is the first frame-block in a
   talkspurt (see definition of the talkspurt in Section 4.1
   [RFC 3551]). For all other packets, the marker bit SHALL be set to
   zero (M=0). 

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for the format defined in this
   memo is outside the scope of this document. The RTP profiles in use
   currently mandate binding the payload type dynamically for this
   payload format. This is basically necessary because the payload type
   expresses the configuration of the payload itself, i.e. basic or
   interleaved mode, and the number of channels carried.

   The remaining RTP header fields are used as specified in [RFC 3550].

3.2. RTP Payload Structure

   The IP-MR payload composed of two payloads, one for current (speech)
   speech and one for redundancy. Both of payloads are represented in a
   form of: Header, Table of contents (TOC) and Data. Redundancy payload
   carries data for preceding and pre-preceding packets.

     +--------+-----+----------------------+- - - - +- -  +- - - - - + 
     | Header | TOC | Data                 | Header | TOC | Data     |
     +--------+-----+----------------------+- - - - +- -  +- - - - - +
     |<- Speech -------------------------->|<- Redundancy (opt) ---->|

3.3. Speech Payload Header

   This header carries parameters which are common for all frames in the
   packet:

                           0                   1
                           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                          |T| CR  | BR  |D|A|GR |R|
                          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      o T (1 bit): Reserved. MUST be always set to 0. Receiver MAY
      discard packet if 'T' bit is not equal to 0.

      o CR (3 bits): Coding rate index - top enchantment layer
      available. The CR value 7 (NO_DATA) indicates that there is no
      speech data (and speech TOC accordingly) in the payload. This MAY
      be used to transmit redundancy data only.

      o BR (3 bits): Base rate index - base layer bitrate. Speech
      payload can be scaled to any rate index between BR and CR. Packets
      with BR = 6 or BR > CR MUST be discarded. Redundancy data is also
      considered as having a base rate of BR.

      o D (1 bit): Reserved. MUST be always set to 1. Receiver MAY
      discard packet if 'D' bit is zero. 

      o A (1 bit): Byte-alignment. The value of 1 specifies that padding
      bits were added to enable each compressed frame (3.5) starts with
      the byte (8 bit) boundary. The value of 0 specifies unaligned
      frames. Note, speech payload is always padded to byte boundary
      independently on  'A' bit value.

      o GR (2 bits): Number of frames in packet (grouping size). Actual
      grouping size is GR + 1, thus maximum grouping supported is 4.

Internet-Draft RTP Payload Format for IP-MR Speech CodecJanuary 11, 2011


      o R (1 bit): Redundancy presence. Value of 1 indicates redundancy
      payload presence.

   Note, the values of 'T' and 'D' bits are fixed, any other values are
   not allowed by specification. padding Padding bits ('P' bits) MUST be
   always set to zero.

   The following table defines mapping between rate index and rate
   value:

                    +------------+--------------+
                    | rate index | avg. bitrate |
                    +------------+--------------+
                    |      0     |   7.7 kbps   |
                    |      1     |   9.8 kbps   |
                    |      2     |  14.3 kbps   |
                    |      3     |  20.8 kbps   |
                    |      4     |  27.9 kbps   |
                    |      5     |  34.2 kbps   |
                    |      6     |  (reserved)  |
                    |      7     |   NO_DATA    |
                    +------------+--------------+

   The value of 6 is reserved. If receiving this value the packet MUST
   be discarded.

3.4. Speech Payload Table of Contents

   The speech TOC is a bit mask indicating the presence of each frame in
   the packet. TOC is only available if 'CR' value is not equal to 7
   (NO_DATA).

                               0 1 2 3
                              +-+-+-+-+
                              |E|E|E|E|
                              +-+-+-+-+
                              |<----->| <-- #(GR+1)

      o E (1 bit): Frame existence indicator. The value of 0 indicates
      speech data does not present for corresponding frame. IP-MR
      encoder sets E flag to 0 for the periods of silence in DTX mode.
      Application MUST set this bit to 0 if the frame is known to be
      damaged.

3.5. Speech Payload Data

   Speech data contains (GR+1) compressed IP-MR frames (20ms of data).
   Compressed frame have zero length if corresponding TOC flag is zero.

   The beginning of each compressed frame is aligned if 'A' bit is
   nonzero, while the end of speech payload is always aligned to a byte
   (8 bit) boundary:

   +- - -+------------+------------+------------+------------+
   | TOC | Frame1     | Frame2     | Frame3     | Frame4     |
   +- - -+------------+------------+------------+------------+   ALWAYS
         |<- aligned  |<- aligned  |<- aligned  |<- aligned  |<- ALIGNED

   Marked regions MUST be padded only if 'A' bit is set to '1'.


   The compressed frame structure is the following:

   |<---- sensitive classes ------>|<----- enchantment layers -------->|
   +-------------------------------+----+-----+------+- - - - - +------+
   | L1 (Base Layer)               | L2 | L3  | L4   |          | LN   |
   +-------------------------------+----+-----+------+- - - - - +------+
   |<- A --->|<- B ->| ... |<- F ->|                                   |
   |<- BR rate ------------------->|                                   |
   |<- CR rate ------------------------------------------------------->|

   The Annex A of this document provides helper routine written in "C"
   which MUST be used to extract sensitivity classes and enchantment
   layers bounds from the compressed frame data. 

3.6. Redundancy Payload Header

   The redundancy payload presence is signaled by R bit of speech
   payload header. Redundancy header is composed of two fields of 3 bits
   each:

                               0 1 2 3 4 5
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+
                              | CL1 | CL2 |
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Both of 'CL1' and 'CL2' fields specify the sensitivity classes
   available for preceding and pre-preceding packets correspondingly.

                    +-------+--------------------+

   Receiver can reconstruct base layer of preceding packets completely
   (CL=6) or partially (0<CL< 6) based on sensitivity classes delivered.
   Decoder MUST discard redundancy payload if CL is equal to 0 or 7.

   Note, the index of the base rate and grouping parameter are not
   transmitted for redundancy payload. Application MUST assume that 'BR'
   and 'GR' are the same as for current packet. 

3.7. Redundancy Payload Table of Contents

   The redundancy TOC is a bit mask indicating the presence of each
   frame in the redundancy payload. Redundancy TOC is only available if
   'CL' value is not equal to 0 or 7. 

                 0 1 ...
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                |E|E|E|E|E|E|E|E|
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                |       |<----->| pre-preceding payload #(GR+1)
                |<----->| preceding payload #(GR+1)

   o E (1 bit): Redundancy frame existence indicator. The value of 0
   indicates redundancy data does not present for corresponding frame.

3.8. Redundancy Payload Data

   IP-MR defines 6 classes ('A'-'F') of sensitivity to bit errors. Any
   damage of class 'A' bits cause significant reconstruction artifacts
   while the loss in class 'F' may be even not perceived by the
   listener. Note, only base layer in a bitstream is represented as a
   set of classes. Together, the set of sensitivity classes approach and
   redundancy allows IP-MR duplicate frames through the packets to
   improve robustness against packet loss.

   Redundancy data carries a number of sensitivity classes for preceding
   and pre-preceding packets as indicated by 'CL1' and 'CL2' fields of
   redundancy header. The sensitivity classes data is available
   individually for each frame only if corresponding 'E' bit of
   redundancy TOC is nonzero:

   +---+---+----+----|-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |A-C|A-B|1000|1001|cl_A1|cl_B1|cl_C1|cl_A1|cl_B1|cl_A4|cl_B4|
   +---+---+----+----|-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |<- CL >|<- TOC ->|<- preceding --->|<- pre-preceding ----->|

   Redundancy data only available if base (BR) and coding (CR) rates of
   preceding and pre-preceding packets are the same as for the current
   packet.

   Receiver MAY use redundancy data to compensate packet loss, note in
   this case the 'CL' field MUST be also passed to decoder. Helper
   routine provided in Annex A MUST be used to extract sensitivity
   classes length for each frame. The following pseudo code describes
   the sequence of operations:

      int sensitivityBits[numOfRedundancyFrames][6];
      int redundancyBits [numOfRedundancyFrames];
      for(i = 0 ; i < numOfRedundancyFrames; i++) {
          GetFrameInfo(CR, BR, pRedundancyPayloadData, dummy, 
                       sensitivityBits[i], dummy);
          redundancyBits[i] = 0;
          for(j = 0; j < CL[i]; j++ ) {
               redundancyBits[i] += sensitivityBits[i][j];
          }
          flushBits(pRedundancyPayloadData, redundancyBits[i]);

   This section provides detailed examples of IP-MR payload format.

4.1. Payload Carrying a Single Frame

   The following diagram shows typical IP-MR payload carrying one (GR=0)
   non-aligned (A=0) speech frame without redundancy (R=0). The base
   layer is coded at 7.8 kbps (BR=0) while the coding rate is 9.7 kbps
   (CR=1). The 'E' bit value of 1 signals that compressed frame bits
   s(0) - s(193) are present. There is a padding bit 'P' to maintain
   speech payload size alignment.

4.2. Payload Carrying Multiple Frames with Redundancy

   The following diagram shows a payload carrying 3 (GR=2) aligned (A=1)
   speech frames with redundancy (R=1). The TOC value of '101' indicates
   speech data presents for a first (bits sp1(0)-sp1(92)) and third
   frames (bits sp3(0)-sp3(171)). There is no enchantment layers because
   of base and coding rates are equal (BR=CR=0). Padding bit 'P' is
   inserted to maintain necessary alignment.

   The redundancy payload presents for both preceding and pre-preceding
   payloads (CL1 = A-B, CL2=A), but redundancy data only available for a
   5 (TOC='111011') of 6 (2*(GR+1)) frames. There are redundancy data of
   20, 39 and 35 bits for each three frames of preceding packet and 15
   and 19 bits for two frames of pre-preceding packet.

5. Congestion Control

   The general congestion control considerations for transporting RTP
   data applicable to IP-MR speech over RTP (see RTP [RFC 3550] and any
   applicable RTP profile like AVP [RFC 3551]). However, the multi-rate
   capability of IP-MR speech coding provides a mechanism that may help
   to control congestion, since the bandwidth demand can be adjusted by
   selecting a different encoding mode.

   The number of frames encapsulated in each RTP payload highly
   influences the overall bandwidth of the RTP stream due to header
   overhead constraints. Packetizing more frames in each RTP payload can
   reduce the number of packets sent and hence the overhead from
   IP/UDP/RTP headers, at the expense of increased delay.

   Due to scalability nature of IP_MR codec the transmission rate can be

Internet-Draft RTP Payload Format for IP-MR Speech CodecJanuary 11, 2011


   reduced at any transport stage to fit channel bandwidth. The minimal
   rate is specified by BR field of payload header and can be is low as
   7.7 kbps. It is up to application to keep balance between coding
   quality (high BR) and bitstream scalability (small BR). Because of
   coding quality depends rather on coding rate(CR) than base rate (BR),
   it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use high BR values for real-time
   communications.

   Application MAY utilize bitstream redundancy to combat packet loss.
   But the gateway is free to chose any option to reduce transmission
   rate - coding layer or redundancy bits can be dropped. Due to this
   fact it is NOT RECOMMENDED application to increase total bitrate when
   adding redundancy in a response to packet loss.

6. Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC 3550] and in any applicable RTP profile. The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity, and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of
   the RTP payload. Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a
   suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism. Such a
   cryptographic system may also allow the authentication of the source
   of the payload. A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload
   format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and at
   least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet
   is from a member of the RTP session.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary. It is dependent on the
   application, the transport, and the signaling protocol employed.
   Therefore, a single mechanism is not sufficient, although if
   suitable, usage of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
   [RFC 3711] is recommended. Other mechanisms that may be used are
   IPsec [RFC 4301] and Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC 5246] (RTP
   over TCP); other alternatives may exist.

   This payload format does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity
   in the receiver side computational complexity for packet processing
   and thus is unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the
   receipt of pathological data.

7. Payload Format Parameters

   This section describes the media types and names associated with this
   payload format.

   The IP-MR media subtype is defined as 'ip-mr_v2.5'. This subtype was
   registered to specify internal codec version. Later, this version was
   accepted as the final, the bitstream was frozen and IP-MR v2.5 was
   published under the name of IP-MR. Currently 'IP-MR' and 'IP-MR v2.5'
   terms are synonyms. The subtype name ip-mr_v2.5 is being uses in
   implementations.

7.1. Media Type Registration

   Media Type name:     audio

   Media Subtype name:  ip-mr_v2.5

   Required parameters: none

7.2. Mapping Media Type Parameters into SDP

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC 4566], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions. When SDP
   is used to specify sessions employing the IP-MR codec, the mapping is
   as follows:
      o The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

      o The media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap"
      as the encoding name. The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST 16000.

      o The parameter "ptime" goes in the SDP "a=ptime" attributes.

   Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by copying
   them directly from the media type parameter string as a semicolon-
   separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   Note that the payload format (encoding) names are commonly shown in
   upper case. Media subtypes are commonly shown in lower case. These
   names are case-insensitive in both places.

8. IANA Considerations

   One media type has been defined and needs registration in the media
   types registry.

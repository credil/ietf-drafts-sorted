Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

Abstract 

   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is 
   based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) procedures as 
   specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudowire (PW) 
   and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with 
   additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) 
   procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management 
   for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of 
   a control plane. 

   This document describes a framework to support a comprehensive set of 
   OAM procedures that fulfills the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [12].  

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force 
   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications 
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport 
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the 
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

Editors' Note: 

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF 
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF 
   Last Call. 

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and 
   insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published 
   RFC has IETF Consensus.] 

1. Introduction 

   As noted in [8], MPLS-TP defines a profile of the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW 
   architectures defined in RFC 3031 [2], RFC 3985 [5] and [7] which is 
   complemented with additional OAM mechanisms and procedures for alarm, 
   fault, performance and protection-switching management for packet 
   transport applications. 

   In line with [13], existing MPLS OAM mechanisms will be used wherever 
   possible and extensions or new OAM mechanisms will be defined only 
   where existing mechanisms are not sufficient to meet the 
   requirements. 

   The MPLS-TP OAM framework defined in this document provides a 
   comprehensive set of OAM procedures that satisfy the MPLS-TP OAM 
   requirements [12]. In this regard, it defines similar OAM 
   functionality as for existing SONET/SDH and OTN OAM mechanisms (e.g. 
   [16]). 

   The MPLS-TP OAM framework is applicable to both LSPs and (MS-)PWs and 
   supports co-routed and bidirectional p2p transport paths as well as 
   unidirectional p2p and p2mp transport paths. 

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force 
   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications 
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport 
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the 
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

1.2. Editors Issues 

Editor's Note: 

   This section is to be removed prior to submission to the RFC editor. 

   1) ME architecture needs further discussion/clarification 

   Agreement (call 24 November): 

      o Co-routed bidirectional p2p transport entity: one bidirectional 
        ME 

      o Associated bidirectional p2p transport entity: two 
        unidirectional MEs 

      o Unidirectional p2p transport entity: one unidirectional ME 

      o Unidirectional p2mp (with N leaves) transport entity: N 
        unidirectional ME 

   Clarify that in a p2mp transport entity all the traffic (including 
   OAM packets) is sent (multicast) from the root to all the leaves. As 
   a consequence: 

      o To send an OAM packet to all leaves, it is required to send a 
        single OAM packet that will be delivered by the forwarding plane 
        to all the leaves and processed by all the leaves. 

      o To send an OAM packet to a single leaf, it is required to send a 
        single OAM packet that will be delivered by the forwarding plane 
        to all the leaves and processed only by the target leaf and 
        ignored by the other leaves. 

      o In order to send an OAM packet to M leaves (i.e., a subset of 
        all the leaves), the current working assumption is to send M 
        different (multicast) OAM packets targeted to each individual 
        leaf in the group of M leaves. Better mechanisms are under 
        investigation and might be added in future versions of this 
        draft. 

   2) Use of terms LTCME and PTCME, should these be genericised for 
      PSTs. 

   Agreement (call 24 November): the editors of the framework document 
   will make sure that the framework document is aligned with the 

 
 
Busi et al.             Expires June 10, 2010                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   decision to use the term PST. This document will be aligned with this 
   decision. 

   3) CV refers to using an ME ID for misbranching detection. This does 
      not align with p2mp LSPs where a CV would then be required to 
      carry all the MEs in the MEG. 

   Agreement (call 24 November): we are going to use the term MEG ID in 
   the document. ME ID has been used in older versions of the document 
   and its use is legacy. 

   For pro-active CC-V (both p2p and p2mp), the globally unique MEP ID 
   information needs to be carried: section on pro-active CC-V needs to 
   be updated accordingly. 

   4) Discussions of PW monitoring and PW tandem connection monitoring 
      seem to be rendered out of scope by the layering decision at 
      Hiroshima. 

   Discussion points (call 24 November) - No agreement reached on this 
   issue 

   PW OAM architecture: based on the architecture defined in this 
   document using MEP and MIPs 

   PW TCM concept: just a specific application of the architecture of 
   the TP-LSP (1:1 mapped with the monitored PW) carrying a PW segment 
   in the MS-PW architecture. 

   Generic clarifications (to be added) [terminology based on RFC 5654]: 

        o before a TCM is setup, we can have a concatenated LSP 
           segment. After the TCM (that is a TP-LSP) is setup, we have a 
           single LSP segment between the TCM end-points; 

        o before a TCM is setup, we can have a concatenated PW segment. 
           After the TCM (that is a TP-LSP) is setup, we have a single 
           PW segment between the TCM end-points. 

   Problems with PW TCM are the implications of removing S-PEs from the 
   PW path. Need further discussion. It is not obvious to Dave that 
   removing an LSR from a path can be done hitlessly either ... by 
   slipping a PST under it ... 

   Action (Italo): check which requirements cannot be met if PW TCM 
   between non-adjacent PEs cannot be supported and whether this is a 
   showstopper issue or not.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   Action (Italo): describe the PW TCM as an LSP and circulate the 
   description to the mailing list for review. If needed, another call 
   will be setup to finalize the discussion. 

   Action (Matthew, Italo): Develop a couple of diagrams showing how the 
   mechanism works for LSPs and PWs. 

   5) Concerns have been raised against the idea of having MIPs capable 
      to generate spontaneous messages. AIS/Lock Indication packets are 
      generated by the adaptation functions. This point needs 
      clarifying. 

   Agreement (9 December): 

   AIS/Lock Indication are generate by a MIP node (to be define as a 
   node hosting a MIP) w/o saying that they are generated by a MIP. 

   The general framework will describe the mechanism for intermediate 
   nodes to insert packets and each specific framework document (e.g., 
   OAM framework) will describe the usage of this capability on a case-
   by-case basis. When you provision bw between two end-points you must 
   allow enough bw for any additional traffic, including traffic from 
   MEPs and MIPs. 

   OAM framework will describe that a MIP node may insert OAM packets 
   into a LSP and this will be described on a function-by-function 
   basis. It will also describe the functions that require a MIP to 
   generate OAM packets (e.g., on-demand CV). 

   6) Presence or absence of MIPs is a bizarre point. At least one MIP 
      in every node is addressed by TTL, and gaps in the enablement of 
      MIPs would produce spurious test results. A convention of "MIPs 
      exist at any node on a transport path that has a return path to a 
      source MEP" would make sense vs. discussing manual 
      enable/disable/configuration of MIPs. 

   Note - the annotated text ("If the set of MIPs is actually sparse 
   (i.e. not every hop is a MIP), then it has to be intermediate nodes 
   to do some operations") needs further clarification. 

   Agreement (9 December): 

   All the intermediate nodes host MIP(s). Local policy allows them to 
   be enabled per function and per LSP. The local policy is controlled 
   by the management system, which may delegate it to the control plane.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   7) Discussions in Hiroshima and subsequent calls have suggested use 
      of alternative return paths "if available", not all of which will 
      be GAL/GACH encapsulated? This point needs clarifying. 

   Agreement (9 December): 

   When the return path is not an MPLS-TP path, the reply message does 
   not need to be GAL/ACH encapsulated. 

   The request message needs to carry sufficient information to allow 
   the target MIP/MEP to reply when a non MPLS-TP return path is used. 

   8) Data plane loopback 

   Action (17 November): check on the mailing list (both ITU-T and IETF 
   to get inputs from both types of operators). 

   9) Review the draft to check that all the known implications related 
      to the support of p2mp transport paths have been described. 

   This check will be done in the next version after the current open 
   points/comments have been resolved. 

   10)Given layering discussion in Hiroshima, it is not very clear 
      whether MPLS TP is a sub layer network within the MPLS layer 
      network or a layer network by its own. 

   This issue should be resolved in the context of the MPLS TP Framework 
   draft but has impacts on this draft as well.

2.2. Definitions 

   Note - the definitions in this section are intended to be in line 
   with ITU-T recommendation Y.1731 in order to have a common, 
   unambiguous terminology. They do not however intend to imply a 
   certain implementation but rather serve as a framework to describe 
   the necessary OAM functions for MPLS-TP. 

   Domain Border Node (DBN): An LSP intermediate MPLS-TP node (LSR) that 
   is at the boundary of an MPLS-TP OAM domain. Such a node may be 
   present on the edge of two domains or may be connected by a link to 
   an MPLS-TP node in another OAM domain. 

   Maintenance Entity (ME): Some portion of a transport path that 
   requires management bounded by two points, and the relationship 
   between those points to which maintenance and monitoring operations 
   apply (details in section 3.1).

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   Maintenance Entity Group (MEG): The set of one or more maintenance 
   entities that maintain and monitor a transport path in an OAM domain. 

   MEP: A MEG end point (MEP) is capable of initiating (MEP Source) and 
   terminating (MEP Sink) OAM messages for fault management and 
   performance monitoring. MEPs reside at the boundaries of an ME 
   (details in section 3.2).  

   MEP Source: A MEP acts as MEP source for an OAM message when it 
   originates and inserts the message into the transport path for its 
   associated MEG. 

   MEP Sink: A MEP acts as a MEP sink for an OAM message when it 
   terminates and processes the messages received from its associated 
   MEG. 

   MIP: A MEG intermediate point (MIP) terminates and processes OAM 
   messages and may generate OAM messages in reaction to received OAM 
   messages. It never generates unsolicited OAM messages itself. A MIP 
   resides within an MEG between MEPs (details in section 3.2). 

   OAM domain: A domain, as defined in [11], whose entities are grouped 
   for the purpose of keeping the OAM confined within that domain. 

   Note - within the rest of this document the term "domain" is used to 
   indicate an "OAM domain" 

   OAM flow: Is the set of all OAM messages originating with a specific 
   MEP that instrument one direction of a MEG. 

   OAM information element: An atomic piece of information exchanged 
   between MEPs in MEG used by an OAM application. 

   OAM Message: One or more OAM information elements that when exchanged 
   between MEPs or between MEPs and MIPs performs some OAM functionality 
   (e.g. connectivity verification) 

   OAM Packet: A packet that carries one or more OAM messages (i.e. OAM 
   information elements). 

   Path: See Transport Path 

   Signal Fail: A condition declared by a MEP when the data forwarding 
   capability associated with a transport path has failed, e.g. loss of 
   continuity.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   Tandem Connection: A tandem connection is an arbitrary part of a 
   transport path that can be monitored (via OAM) independent of the 
   end-to-end monitoring (OAM). The tandem connection may also include 
   the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the boundaries of the 
   tandem connection.  

   This document uses the terms defined in RFC 5654 [11]. 

   This document uses the term 'Per-hop Behavior' as defined in [14]. 

3. Functional Components 

   MPLS-TP defines a profile of the MPLS and PW architectures ([2], [5] 
   and [7]) that is designed to transport service traffic where the 
   characteristics of information transfer between the transport path 
   endpoints can be demonstrated to comply with certain performance and 
   quality guarantees. In order to verify and maintain these performance 
   and quality guarantees, there is a need to not only apply OAM 
   functionality on a transport path granularity (e.g. LSP or MS-PW), 
   but also on arbitrary parts of transport paths, defined as Tandem 
   Connections, between any two arbitrary points along a path.  

   In order to describe the required OAM functionality, this document 
   introduces a set of high-level functional components. [Note - 
   discussion in Munich -tues concluded that TCM not possible with PWs - 
   can monitor a single PW segment - but attempting to monitor more than 
   one segment converts the PW into an LSP and therefore the intervening 
   SPEs are unable to see the PW as a PW due to the differences in how 
   OAM flows are disambiguated.] [editors: if true this IMO is a huge 
   problem as the one place I would really want TCM is a multi-domain 
   MS-PW, else I have to control plane peer at two layers, pending 
   resolution of discussion item 4 in section 1.2] 

   When a control plane is not present, the management plane configures 
   these functional components. Otherwise they can be configured either 
   by the management plane or by the control plane. 

   These functional components should be instantiated when the path is 
   created by either the management plane or by the control plane (if 
   present). Some components may be instantiated after the path is 
   initially created (e.g. PST). 

   [Dave: are we discussing the same issue for LSP PSTs as for PWs, an 
   S-PE cannot easily be removed, certainly not hitlessly, how is an LSP 
   different?]

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

3.1. Maintenance Entity and Maintenance Entity Group 

   MPLS-TP OAM operates in the context of Maintenance Entities (MEs) 
   that are a relationship between two points of a point to point 
   transport path or a root and a leaf of a point to multipoint 
   transport path to which maintenance and monitoring operations apply. 
   These two points are called Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) End Points 
   (MEPs). In between these two points zero or more intermediate points, 
   called Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs), MAY exist 
   and can be shared by more than one ME in a MEG.  

   The MEPs that form an MEG are configured and managed to limit the 
   scope of an OAM flow within the MEG that the MEPs belong to (i.e. 
   within the domain of the transport path or segment, in the specific 
   sub-layer of the MPLS layer network, that is being monitored and 
   managed). A misbranching fault may cause OAM packets to be delivered 
   to a MEP that is not in the MEG of origin.  

   The abstract reference model for an ME with MEPs and MIPs is 
   described in Figure 1 below: 

    
                            +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+ 
                            |A|----|B|----|C|----|D| 
                            +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+ 
    
                   Figure 1 ME Abstract Reference Model 

   The instantiation of this abstract model to different MPLS-TP 
   entities is described in section 4. In this model, nodes A, B, C and 
   D can be LER/LSR for an LSP or the {S|T}-PEs for a MS-PW. MEPs reside 
   in nodes A and D while MIPs reside in nodes B and C. The links 
   connecting adjacent nodes can be physical links, or sub-layer 
   LSPs/PSTs. 

   This functional model defines the relationships between all OAM 
   entities from a maintenance perspective, to allow each Maintenance 
   Entity to monitor and manage the layer network under its 
   responsibility and to localize problems efficiently. 

   [Editor's note - MEG are sub-layers. Need to check the document for 
   consistency with this agreement] 

   An MPLS-TP maintenance entity group can cover either the whole end-
   to-end path or a path segment tunnel supporting some portion of the 
   transport path. A Maintenance Entity Group may be defined to monitor 
   the transport path for fault and/or performance management.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   In case of associated bi-directional paths, two independent 
   Maintenance Entities are defined to independently monitor each 
   direction. This has implications for transactions that terminate at 
   or query a MIP as a return path from MIP to source MEP does not exist 
   in a unidirectional ME. 

   The following properties apply to all MPLS-TP MEGs: 

   o They can be nested but not overlapped, e.g. an MEG may cover a 
      segment or a concatenated segment of another MEG, and may also 
      include the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the edge(s) of 
      the segment or concatenated segment, but all its MEPs and MIPs are 
      no longer part of the encompassing MEG. It is possible that MEPs 
      of nested MEGs reside on a single node. 

   o Each OAM flow is associated with a single Maintenance Entity 
      Group. 

   o OAM packets that instrument a particular direction of an LSP are 
      subject to the same forwarding treatment (i.e. fate share) as the 
      data traffic and in some cases may be required to have common 
      queuing discipline E2E with the class of traffic monitored. OAM 
      packets can be distinguished from the data traffic using the GAL 
      and ACH constructs [9] for LSP and Section or the ACH construct 
      [6]and [9] for (MS-)PW. 

   [Editor's note: A key point in the definition of an ME is the end-
   points are defined by location of the logical function MEP 

   Later in the framework we will discuss the precision with which we 
   can identify the location of a MEP/MIP i.e, ingress i/f, egress i/f 
   or node. 

   We need to distinguish between the point of interception of an OAM 
   msg and the point where the action takes place. 

   Action: look at the text in the framework document regarding the 
   location of the functional components (MEPs and MIPs).] 

   [Editors' note: Somewhere we need to distinguish between the OAM 
   control function and the OAM measurement function. i.e. we set up a 
   loop back (a control function, in which case the OAM message may be 
   intercepted and actioned anywhere convenient), and the measurement 
   function (i.e. looping the packet to determine that it reached a 
   particular part of the network) which needs to be actioned at a 
   precisely know and stipulated point in the network/equipment.

   Note that not all functionality / processing of an OAM pkt needs to

   [Editors' note - Address this comment while addressing the control 
   and measurement issue above. 

   We considered that an OAM function can be decomposed into the 
   following components 

   - Instruction or command 

   - Execution  

   - Addressing (node, interface etc) is ttl/LSP enough - do we need 
      sub-addressing to cause execution on a specific component in the 
      node - i.e. egress interface 

   - Response via OAM  

   - Reporting to mgt interface] 

   [Editor's note: the MPLS-TP framework will describe how it is 
   possible to inject OAM packets on intermediate nodes. We need to 
   describe how this capability is used within the OAM framework and to 
   reference to the MPLS-TP framework for the description of this 
   capability] 

   Another OAM construct is referred to as Maintenance Entity Group, 
   which is a collection of one or more MEs that belongs to the same 
   transport path and that are maintained and monitored as a group. 

   A use case for an MEG with more than one ME is point-to-multipoint 
   OAM. The reference model for the p2mp MEG is represented in Figure 2.

                   Figure 2 Reference Model for p2mp MEG 

   In case of p2mp transport paths, the OAM operations are independent 
   for each ME (A-D, A-E and A-F): 

   o Fault conditions - some faults may impact more than one ME 
      depending from where the failure is located 

   o Packet loss - packet dropping may impact more than one ME 
      depending from where the packets are lost 

   o Packet delay - depending on different paths 

   Each leaf (i.e. D, E and F) terminates OAM flows to monitor the ME 
   from itself and the root while the root (i.e. A) generates OAM 
   messages common to all the MEs of the p2mp MEG. Nodes B and C MAY 
   implement a MIP in the corresponding MEG. 

3.2. MEG End Points (MEPs) 

   MEG End Points (MEPs) are the source and sink points of an MEG. In 
   the context of an MPLS-TP LSP, only LERs can implement MEPs while in 
   the context of a path segment tunnel (PST) both LERs and LSRs can 
   implement MEPs that contribute to the overall monitoring 
   infrastructure for the transport path. Regarding MPLS-TP PW, only T-
   PEs can implement MEPs while for PSTs supporting a PW both T-PEs and 
   S-PEs can implement MEPs. In the context of MPLS-TP Section, any 
   MPLS-TP NE can implement a MEP. 

   [Munich: See note about PW Tandem monitoring earlier, and whether a 
   PW can be a tandem connection - for further discussion (discussion 
   point 4 in section 1.2)] 

   MEPs are responsible for activating and controlling all of the OAM 
   functionality for the MEG. A MEP is capable of originating and

   terminating OAM messages for fault management and performance 
   monitoring. These OAM messages are encapsulated into an OAM packet 
   using the G-ACh as defined in RFC 5586 [9]: in this case the G-ACh 
   message is an OAM message and the channel type indicates an OAM 
   message. A MEP terminates all the OAM packets it receives from the 
   MEG it belongs to. The MEG the OAM packet belongs to is inferred from 
   the MPLS or PW label.[Editors: given the discussion about alternative 
   return paths, is a GAL/GaCH always present ...?. For discussion on 
   the IETF review calls] 

   Once an MEG is configured, the operator can configure which OAM 
   functions to use on the MEG but the MEPs are always enabled. A node 
   at the edge of an MEG always supports a MEP. 

   MEPs terminate all OAM packets received from the associated transport 
   path or path segment tunnel [Editors: the PST definition in the 
   framework should be augmented to clarity that the clients of a PST 
   should always be LSPs or PWs]. As the MEP corresponds to the 
   termination of the forwarding path for an MEG at the given sub-level, 
   OAM packets never "leaks" outside of a MEG in a fault free 
   implementation. 

   A MEP of an MPLS-TP transport path (Section, LSP or PW) coincides 
   with transport path termination and monitors it for failures or 
   performance degradation (e.g. based on packet counts) in an end-to-
   end scope. Note that both MEP source and MEP sink coincide with 
   transport paths' source and sink terminations. 

   The MEPs of a path segment tunnel are not necessarily coincident with 
   the termination of the MPLS-TP transport path (LSP or PW) and monitor 
   some portion of the transport path for failures or performance 
   degradation (e.g. based on packet counts) only within the boundary of 
   the MEG for the path segment tunnel. 

   An MPLS-TP MEP sink passes a fault indication to its client 
   (sub-)layer network as a consequent action of fault detection. 

   It may occur that the MEPs of a path segment tunnel are set on both 
   sides of the forwarding engine such that the MEG is entirely internal 
   to the node. 

   Note that a MEP can only exist at the beginning and end of a 
   sub-layer i.e. an LSP or PW. If we need to monitor some portion of 
   that LSP or PW [editor: mention of PW in this context needs to be 
   revised after agreement on discussion point 4 in section 1.2], a new 
   sub-layer in the form of a path segment tunnel MUST be created which 
   permits MEPs and an associated MEG to be created.

   [Editor's note: Update the draft to capture the agreements below 
   after the discussion points 5, 6 and 7 in section 1.2 are resolved 
   (to maintain consistency): 

   We have the case of a MIP sending msg to a MEP. To do this it uses 
   the LSP label - i.e. the top label of the stack at that point. 
   [editors: move and clarify in section 3.3 - for further discuss. 

   If the set of MIPs is actually sparse (i.e. not every hop is a MIP), 
   then it has to be intermediate nodes to do some operations.] 

   Agreement (10 November): An intermediate node can send an OAM packet. 

   Clarify that we need to provide enough bandwidth on the transport 
   paths to support OAM traffic (throughout the framework document). 

   From IETF point of view no distinction between MIPs and adaptation 
   functions. 

   Lou question about how triggered response OAM packets are sent by 
   MIPs/MEPs. 

   Agreement (call 9 December): 

        o bidirectional co-routed: use the reverse path (thus checking 
          both the forward and backward directions of the transport 
          path). Co-routed bidirectional transport paths can have a 
          minimum bandwidth return path. 

        o unidirectional p2p and p2mp: no ability to support triggered 
          response OAM message 

   Non MPLS-TP LSP/PW return path MAY be requested by the OAM message 
   triggering the reply and the target MIP/MEP MAY attempt to reply 
   using the requested return path. 

   In this case, only the forward direction of the MPLS-TP transport 
   path is checked and the connectivity to the source MEP via the 
   requested return path is not guaranteed. 

   Agreement (call 17 November) to use as a working assumption the same 
   MEP/MIP model in MS-PW OAM architecture. In order to validate this 
   working assumption we need to understand how to describe the PW 
   Status information: this information is propagated on a hop-by-hop

   basis between adjacent PEs using LDP (dynamic PW segments) or ACH 
   Status PW (static PW segments).] 

3.3. MEG Intermediate Points (MIPs) 

   A MEG Intermediate Point (MIP) is a point between the MEPs of an MEG. 

   A MIP is capable of reacting to some OAM packets and forwarding all 
   the other OAM packets while ensuring fate sharing with data plane 
   packets. However, a MIP does not initiate [unsolicited OAM - editors: 
   this text was removed in the commented .rtf document from Munich but 
   not tracked as a revision, validate this change after MIP/MEP 
   discussion (discussion point 5 in section 1.2)] packets, but may be 
   addressed by OAM packets initiated by one of the MEPs of the MEG. A 
   MIP can generate OAM packets only in response to OAM packets that are 
   sent on the MEG it belongs to. 

   An intermediate node within a point-to-point MEG can either: 

   o not support MPLS-TP OAM (i.e. no MIPs per node) 

   o support per-node MIP (i.e. a single MIP per node) 

   o support per-interface MIP (i.e. two MIPs per node on both sides of 
      the forwarding engine) 

   [Editor's note - Need to describe MIPs for p2mp MEGs] 

   [Editor's note - Add a Figure to describe how the two options can be 
   support] 

   A node at the edge of an MEG can also support a MEP and a 
   per-interface MIP at the two sides of the forwarding engine. 

   When sending an OAM packet to a MIP, the source MEP should set the 
   TTL field to indicate the number of hops necessary to reach the node 
   where the MIP resides. It is always assumed that the "pipe"/"short 
   pipe" model of TTL handling is used by the MPLS transport profile.  

   The source MEP should also include Target MIP information in the OAM 
   packets sent to a MIP to allow proper identification of the MIP 
   within the node. The MEG the OAM packet is associated with is 
   inferred from the MPLS label. 

   Once an MEG is configured, the operator can enable/disable the MIPs 
   on the nodes within the MEG. [Editors': review this paragraph after 
   discussion point 6 in section 1.2 is resolved]

3.4.  Server MEPs 

   A server MEP is a MEP of an MEG that is either: 

   o defined in a layer network that is "below", which is to say 
      encapsulates and transports the MPLS-TP layer network being 
      referenced, or 

   o defined in a sub-layer of the MPLS-TP layer network that is 
      "below" which is to say encapsulates and transports the sub-layer 
      being referenced. 

   A server MEP can coincide with a MIP or a MEP in the client (MPLS-TP) 
   layer network. 

   [Editors' note: review the text above pending discussion of whether 
   MPLS-TP is a sub-layer network within the MPLS layer network or a 
   layer network by its own (discussion point 10 in section 1.2)] 

   A server MEP also interacts with the client/server adaptation 
   function between the client (MPLS-TP) (sub-)layer network and the 
   server (sub-)layer network. The adaptation function maintains state 
   on the mapping of MPLS-TP transport paths that are setup over that 
   server layer's transport path.  

   For example, a server MEP can be either: 

   o A termination point of a physical link (e.g. 802.3), an SDH VC or 
      OTN ODU, for the MPLS-TP Section layer network, defined in section 
      4.1; 

   o An MPLS-TP Section MEP for MPLS-TP LSPs, defined in section 4.2; 

   o An MPLS-TP LSP MEP for MPLS-TP PWs, defined in section 4.4; 

   o An MPLS-TP PST MEP for higher-level PSTs, defined in section 4.3; 

   o An MPLS-TP PW Tandem Connection MEP for higher-level PTCMEs, 
      defined in section 4.5. [Editor: update this bullet after the 
      discussion on PW TCM (discussion point 4 in section 1.2)] 

   The server MEP can run appropriate OAM functions for fault detection 
   within the server (sub-)layer network, and provides a fault 
   indication to its client MPLS-TP layer network. Server MEP OAM 
   functions are outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

3.5. Path Segment Tunnels and Tandem Connection Monitoring 

   Path segment tunnels (PSTs) are instantiated to provide monitoring of 
   a portion of a set of co-routed transport paths. Path segment tunnels 
   can also be employed to meet the requirement to provide tandem 
   connection monitoring (TCM). 

   TCM for a given portion of a transport path is implemented by first 
   creating a path segment tunnel that that has a 1:1 association with 
   portion of the transport path that is to be uniquely monitored. This 
   means there is direct correlation between all FM and PM information 
   gathered for the PST AND the monitored portion of the E2E path. The 
   PST is monitored using normal LSP monitoring. 

   There are a number of implications to this approach: 

   1) The PST would use the uniform model of EXP code point copying 
      between sub-layers for diffserv such that the E2E markings and 
      PHB treatment for the transport path was preserved by the PST. 

   2) The PST would use the pipe model for TTL handling such that MIP 
      addressing for the E2E entity would be not be impacted by the 
      presence of the PST. 

   3) PM statistics need to be adjusted for the encapsulation overhead 
      of the additional PST sub-layer. 

4. Reference Model 

   The reference model for the MPLS-TP framework builds upon the concept 
   of an MEG, and its associated MEPs and MIPs, to support the 
   functional requirements specified in [12].  

   The following MPLS-TP MEGs are specified in this document: 

   o A Section Maintenance Entity Group (SME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of MPLS-TP Sections (between MPLS LSRs). 

   o A LSP Maintenance Entity Group (LME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of an end-to-end LSP (between LERs). 

   o A PW Maintenance Entity Group (PME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of an end-to-end SS/MS-PWs (between T-PEs). 

   o A PST Maintenance Entity Group (PSTME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of a path segment tunnel (between any LERs/LSRs along 
      an LSP).

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   o A MS-PW Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (PTCME), allowing 
      monitoring and management of a PW Tandem Connection (between any 
      T-PEs/S-PEs along the (MS-)PW) [Editors': update this bullet after 
      resolution of PW TCM discussion (discussion point 4 in section 
      1.2] 

   The MEGs specified in this MPLS-TP framework are compliant with the 
   architecture framework for MPLS-TP MS-PWs [7] and LSPs [2]. 

   Hierarchical LSPs are also supported in the form of path segment 
   tunnels. In this case, each LSP Tunnel in the hierarchy is a 
   different sub-layer network that can be monitored, independently from 
   higher and lower level LSP tunnels in the hierarchy, on an end-to-end 
   basis (from LER to LER) by a PSTME. It is possible to monitor a 
   portion of a hierarchical LSP by instantiating a hierarchical PSTME 
   between any LERs/LSRs along the hierarchical LSP.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   Figure 3 depicts a high-level reference model for the MPLS-TP OAM 
   framework. The figure depicts portions of two MPLS-TP enabled network 
   domains, Domain 1 and Domain Z. In Domain 1, LSR1 is adjacent to LSR2 
   via the MPLS Section Sec12 and LSR2 is adjacent to LSR3 via the MPLS 
   Section Sec23. Similarly, in Domain Z, LSRX is adjacent to LSRY via 
   the MPLS Section SecXY and LSRY is adjacent to LSRZ via the MPLS 
   Section SecYZ. In addition, LSR3 is adjacent to LSRX via the MPLS 
   Section 3X. 

   Figure 3 also shows a bi-directional MS-PW (PW1Z) between AC1 on TPE1 
   and AC2 on TPEZ. The MS-PW consists of three bi-directional PW 
   Segments: 1) PW13 segment between T-PE1 and S-PE3 via the bi-
   directional PSN13 LSP, 2) PW3X segment between S-PE3 and S-PEX, via 
   the bi-directional PSN3X LSP, and 3) PWXZ segment between S-PEX and 
   T-PEZ via the bi-directional PSNXZ LSP. 

   The MPLS-TP OAM procedures that apply to an MEG of a given transport 
   path are expected to operate independently from procedures on other 
   MEGs of the same transport path and certainly MEGs of other transport 
   paths. Yet, this does not preclude that multiple MEGs may be affected 
   simultaneously by the same network condition, for example, a fiber 
   cut event.  

   Note that there are no constrains imposed by this OAM framework on 
   the number, or type (p2p, p2mp, LSP or PW), of MEGs that may be 
   instantiated on a particular node. In particular, when looking at 
   Figure 3, it should be possible to configure one or more MEPs on the 
   same node if that node is the endpoint of one or more MEGs. 

   Figure 3 does not describe a PW3X PPSTME because typically PSTs are 
   used to monitor an OAM domain (like PW13 and PWXZ PPSTMEs) rather 
   than the segment between two OAM domains. However the OAM framework 
   does not pose any constraints on the way PSTs are instantiated as 
   long as they are not overlapping. 

   The subsections below define the MEGs specified in this MPLS-TP OAM 
   architecture framework document. Unless otherwise stated, all 
   references to domains, LSRs, MPLS Sections, LSPs, pseudowires and 
   MEGs in this section are made in relation to those shown in Figure 3.  

4.1. MPLS-TP Section Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP Section ME (SME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended 
   to an MPLS Section as defined in [11]. An SME may be configured on 
   any MPLS section. SME OAM packets must fate share with the user data 
   packets sent over the monitored MPLS Section.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   An SME is intended to be deployed for applications where it is 
   preferable to monitor the link between topologically adjacent (next 
   hop in this layer network) MPLS (and MPLS-TP enabled) LSRs rather 
   than monitoring the individual LSP or PW segments traversing the MPLS 
   Section and the server layer technology does not provide adequate OAM 
   capabilities.

   5. SecYZ ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR Y and LSR Z. 

4.2. MPLS-TP LSP End-to-End Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP LSP ME (LME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to 
   monitor an end-to-end LSP between two LERs. An LME may be configured 
   on any MPLS LSP. LME OAM packets must fate share with user data 
   packets sent over the monitored MPLS-TP LSP.

   An LME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is desirable 
   to monitor an entire LSP between its LERs, rather than, say, 
   monitoring individual PWs.

   Figure 5 depicts 2 LMEs configured in the path between AC1 and AC2: 
   1) the PSN13 LME between LER 1 and LER 3, and 2) the PSNXZ LME 
   between LER X and LER Y. Note that the presence of a PSN3X LME in 
   such a configuration is optional, hence, not precluded by this 
   framework. For instance, the SPs may prefer to monitor the MPLS-TP 
   Section between the two LSRs rather than the individual LSPs.  

4.3. MPLS-TP LSP Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP LSP Path Segment Tunnel ME (LPSTME) is an MPLS-TP 
   maintenance entity intended to monitor an arbitrary part of an LSP 
   between a given pair of LSRs independently from the end-to-end 
   monitoring (LME). An LPSTMEE can monitor an LSP segment or 
   concatenated segment and it may also include the forwarding engine(s) 
   of the node(s) at the edge(s) of the segment or concatenated segment. 

   Multiple LPSTMEs MAY be configured on any LSP. The LSRs that 
   terminate the LPSTME may or may not be immediately adjacent at the 
   MPLS-TP layer. LPSTME OAM packets must fate share with the user data 
   packets sent over the monitored LSP segment. 

   A LPSTME can be defined between the following entities: 

   o LER and any LSR of a given LSP. 

   o Any two LSRs of a given LSP.

   An LPSTME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of an LSP or set of 
   LSPs rather than the entire LSP itself, for example when there is a 
   need to monitor a part of an LSP that extends beyond the 
   administrative boundaries of an MPLS-TP enabled administrative 
   domain.

            Figure 6 MPLS-TP LSP Path Segment Tunnel ME (LPSTME) 

   Figure 6 depicts a variation of the reference model in Figure 3 where 
   there is an end-to-end PSN LSP (PSN1Z LSP) between PE1 and PEZ. PSN1Z 
   LSP consists of, at least, three LSP Concatenated Segments: PSN13, 
   PSN3X and PSNXZ. In this scenario there are two separate LTCMEs 
   configured to monitor the PSN1Z LSP: 1) a LPSTME monitoring the PSN13 
   LSP Concatenated Segment on Domain 1 (PSN13 LPSTME), and 2) a LPSTME 
   monitoring the PSNXZ LSP Concatenated Segment on Domain Z (PSNXZ 
   LPSTME). 

   It is worth noticing that LPSTMEs can coexist with the LME monitoring 
   the end-to-end LSP and that LPSTME MEPs and LME MEPs can be 
   coincident in the same node (e.g. PE1 node supports both the PSN1Z 
   LME MEP and the PSN13 LPSTME MEP).

4.4. MPLS-TP PW Monitoring 

   An MPLS-TP PW ME (PME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to 
   monitor a SS-PW or MS-PW between a pair of T-PEs. A PME MAY be 
   configured on any SS-PW or MS-PW. PME OAM packets must fate share 
   with the user data packets sent over the monitored PW. 

   A PME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is desirable 
   to monitor an entire PW between a pair of MPLS-TP enabled T-PEs 
   rather than monitoring the LSP aggregating multiple PWs between PEs.

4.5. MPLS-TP MS-PW Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring 

   [Editors' note: revise this section after the discussion on PW TCM is 
   closed (discussion item 4 in section 1.2)] 

   An MPLS-TP MS-PW Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring ME (PPSTME) is an 
   MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to monitor an arbitrary part of 
   an MS-PW between a given pair of PEs independently from the end-to-
   end monitoring (PME). A PPSTME can monitor a PW segment or 
   concatenated segment and it may also include the forwarding engine(s) 
   of the node(s) at the edge(s) of the segment or concatenated segment. 

   Multiple PPSTMEs MAY be configured on any MS-PW. The PEs may or may 
   not be immediately adjacent at the MS-PW layer. PPSTME OAM packets 
   fate share with the user data packets sent over the monitored PW 
   Segment.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   A PPSTME can be defined between the following entities: 

   o T-PE and any S-PE of a given MS-PW 

   o Any two S-PEs of a given MS-PW. It can span several PW segments.  

   A PPSTME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of a MS-PW rather than

   Domain 1 (PW13 PPSTME), and 2) a PTCME monitoring the PWXZ MS-PW 
   Segment on Domain Z with (PWXZ PPSTME). 

   It is worth noticing that PPSTMEs can coexist with the PME monitoring 
   the end-to-end MS-PW and that PPSTME MEPs and PME MEPs can be 
   coincident in the same node (e.g. TPE1 node supports both the PW1Z 
   PME MEP and the PW13 PPSTME MEP). 

5. OAM Functions for proactive monitoring

   section in the OAM Requirements document and explicitly list 
   additional detailed requirements wrt the OAM Requirements document]

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   In this document, proactive monitoring refers to OAM operations that 
   are either configured to be carried out periodically and continuously 
   or preconfigured to act on certain events such as alarm signals. 

5.1. Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification 

   Proactive Continuity Check functions are used to detect a loss of 
   continuity defect (LOC) between two MEPs in an MEG. 

   Proactive Connectivity Verification functions are used to detect an 
   unexpected connectivity defect between two MEGs (e.g. mismerging or 
   misconnection), as well as unexpected connectivity within the MEG 
   with an unexpected MEP. 

   Both functions are based on the (proactive) generation of OAM packets 
   by the source MEP that are processed by the sink MEP. As a 
   consequence these two functions are grouped together into Continuity 
   Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) OAM packets. 

   In order to perform pro-active Connectivity Verification function, 
   each CC-V OAM packet MUST also include a globally unique Source MEP 
   identifier. When used to perform only pro-active Continuity Check 
   function, the CC-V OAM packet MAY not include any globally unique 
   Source MEP identifier identifier. Different formats of MEP 
   identifiers are defined in [10] to address different environments. 
   When MPLS-TP is deployed in transport network environments where IP 
   addressing is not used in the forwarding plane, the ICC-based format 
   for MEP identification is used. When MPLS-TP is deployed in IP-based 
   environment, the IP-based MEP identification is used. 

   As a consequence, it is not possible to detect misconnections between 
   two MEGs monitored only for Continuity while it is possible to detect 
   any misconnection between two MEGs monitored for Continuity and 
   Connectivity or between an MEG monitored for Continuity and 
   Connectivity and one MEG monitored only for Continuity. 

   [Editor's note - Rephrase the previous paragraph: describe the four 
   cases.] 

   CC-V OAM packets MUST be transmitted at a regular, operator's 
   configurable, rate. The default CC-V transmission periods are 
   application dependent (see section 5.1.4). 

   Proactive CC-V OAM packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss 
   probability PHB" within a single network operator. This PHB is 
   configurable on network operator's basis. PHBs can be translated at

   the network borders by the same function that translates it for user 
   data traffic. 

   [Editor's note - Describe the relation between the previous paragraph 
   and the fate sharing requirement. Need to clarify also in the 
   requirement document that for proactive CC-V the fate sharing is 
   related to the forwarding behavior and not to the QoS behavior] 

   In a bidirectional point-to-point transport path, when a MEP is 
   enabled to generate pro-active CC-V OAM packets with a configured 
   transmission rate, it also expects to receive pro-active CC-V OAM 
   packets from its peer MEP at the same transmission rate as a common 
   SLA applies to all components of the transport path. In a 
   unidirectional transport path (either point-to-point or point-to-
   multipoint), only the source MEP is enabled to generate CC-V OAM 
   packets and only the sink MEP is configured to expect these packets 
   at the configured rate. 

   MIPs, as well as intermediate nodes not supporting MPLS-TP OAM, are 
   transparent to the pro-active CC-V information and forward these pro-
   active CC-V OAM packets as regular data packets. 

   It is desirable to not generate spurious alarms during initialization 
   or tear down; hence the following procedures are recommended. At 
   initialization, the MEP source function (generating pro-active CC-V 
   packets) should be enabled prior to the corresponding MEP sink 
   function (detecting continuity and connectivity defects).  When 
   disabling the CC-V proactive functionality, the MEP sink function 
   should be disabled prior to the corresponding MEP source function. 

5.1.1. Defects identified by CC-V 

   Pro-active CC-V functions allow a sink MEP to detect the defect 
   conditions described in the following sub-sections. For all of the 
   described defect cases, the sink MEP SHOULD notify the equipment 
   fault management process of the detected defect. 

5.1.1.1. Loss Of Continuity defect  

   When proactive CC-V is enabled, a sink MEP detects a loss of 
   continuity (LOC) defect when it fails to receive pro-active CC-V OAM 
   packets from the peer MEP. 

   o Entry criteria:  if no pro-active CC-V OAM packets from the peer 
      MEP (i.e. with the correct globally unique Source MEP identifier) 
      are received within the interval equal to 3.5 times the receiving 
      MEP's configured CC-V reception period.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   o Exit criteria: a pro-active CC-V OAM packet from the peer MEP 
      (i.e. with the correct globally unique Source MEP identifier) is 
      received. 

5.1.1.2. Mis-connectivity defect 

   When a pro-active CC-V OAM packet is received, a sink MEP identifies 
   a mis-connectivity defect (e.g. mismerge, misconnection or unintended 
   looping) with its peer source MEP when the received packet carries an 
   incorrect globally unique Source MEP identifier. 

   o Entry criteria: the sink MEP receives a pro-active CC-V OAM packet 
      with an incorrect globally unique Source MEP identifier. 

   o Exit criteria: the sink MEP does not receive any pro-active CC-V 
      OAM packet with an incorrect globally unique Source MEP identifier 
      for an interval equal at least to 3.5 times the longest 
      transmission period of the pro-active CC-V OAM packets received 
      with an incorrect globally unique Source MEP identifier since this 
      defect has been raised. This requires the OAM message to self 
      identify the CC-V periodicity as not all MEPs can be expected to 
      have knowledge of all MEGs. 

5.1.1.3. Period Misconfiguration defect 

   If pro-active CC-V OAM packets are received with a correct globally 
   unique Source MEP identifier but with a transmission period different 
   than the locally configured reception period, then a CV period mis-
   configuration defect is detected. 

   o Entry criteria: a MEP receives a CC-V pro-active packet with 
      correct globally unique Source MEP identifier but with a Period 
      field value different than its own CC-V configured transmission 
      period.  

   o Exit criteria: the sink MEP does not receive any pro-active CC-V 
      OAM packet with a correct globally unique Source MEP identifier 
      and an incorrect transmission period for an interval equal at 
      least to 3.5 times the longest transmission period of the pro-
      active CC-V OAM packets received with a correct globally unique 
      Source MEP identifier and an incorrect transmission period since 
      this defect has been raised. 

5.1.2. Consequent action 

   [editors: IMO this would be better folded into the specific defect 
   types, If agreed I will edit accordingly] 
 
 
Busi et al.             Expires June 10, 2010                [Page 31] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   A sink MEP that detects one of the defect conditions defined in 
   section 5.1.1 MUST perform the following consequent actions. Some of 
   these consequent actions SHOULD be enabled/disabled by the operator 
   depending upon the application used (see section 5.1.4). 

   If a MEP detects an unexpected globally unique Source MEP Identifier, 
   it MUST block all the traffic (including also the user data packets) 
   that it receives from the misconnected transport path. 

   If a MEP detects LOC defect that is not caused by a period 
   mis-configuration, it SHOULD block all the traffic (including also 
   the user data packets) that it receives from the transport path, if 
   this consequent action has been enabled by the operator. 

   It is worth noticing that the OAM requirements document [12] 
   recommends that CC-V proactive monitoring is enabled on every MEG in 
   order to reliably detect connectivity defects. However, CC-V 
   proactive monitoring MAY be disabled by an operator on an MEG. In the 
   event of a misconnection between a transport path that is pro-
   actively monitored for CC-V and a transport path which is not, the 
   MEP of the former transport path will detect a LOC defect 
   representing a connectivity problem (e.g. a misconnection with a 
   transport path where CC-V proactive monitoring is not enabled) 
   instead of a continuity problem, with a consequent wrong traffic 
   delivering. For these reasons, the traffic block consequent action is 
   applied even when a LOC condition occurs. This block consequent 
   action MAY be disabled through configuration. This deactivation of 
   the block action may be used for activating or deactivating the 
   monitoring when it is not possible to synchronize the function 
   activation of the two peer MEPs. 

   If a MEP detects a LOC defect (section 5.1.1.1),  a mis-connectivity 
   defect (section 5.1.1.2) or a period misconfiguration defect (section 
   5.1.1.3), it MUST declare a signal fail condition at the transport 
   path level. 

   [Editor's note - Transport equipment also performs defect correlation 
   (as defined in G.806) in order to properly report failures to the 
   transport NMS]. The current working assumption, to be further 
   investigated, is that defect correlations are outside the scope of 
   this document and to be defined in ITU-T documents.] 

5.1.3. Configuration considerations 

   At all MEPs inside a MEG, the following configuration information 
   needs to be configured when a proactive CC-V function is enabled: 

 
 
Busi et al.             Expires June 10, 2010                [Page 32] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   o MEG ID; the MEG identifier to which the MEP belongs; 

   o MEP-ID; the MEP's own identity inside the MEG; 

   o list of peer MEPs inside the MEG. For a point-to-point MEG the 
      list would consist of the single peer MEP ID from which the OAM 
      packets are expected. In case of the root MEP of a p2mp MEG, the 
      list is composed by all the leaf MEP IDs inside the MEG. In case 
      of the leaf MEP of a p2mp MEG, the list is composed by the root 
      MEP ID (i.e. each leaf MUST know the root MEP ID from which it 
      expect to receive the CC-V OAM packets). 

   o transmission rate; the default CC-V transmission periods are 
      application dependent (see section 5.1.4) 

   Note that the reception period is the same as the configured 
   transmission rate. 

   o PHB; it identifies the per-hop behaviour of CC-V packet. Proactive 
      CC-V packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss probability 
      PHB" previously configured within a single network operator. This 
      PHB is configurable on network operator's basis. PHBs can be 
      translated at the network borders.  

   For statically provisioned transport paths the above information are 
   statically configured; for dynamically established transport paths 
   the configuration information are signaled via the control plane. 

5.1.4. Applications for proactive CC-V  

   CC-V is applicable for fault management, performance monitoring, or 
   protection switching applications. 

   o Fault Management: default transmission period is 1s (i.e. 
      transmission rate of 1 packet/second). 

   o Performance Monitoring: default transmission period is 100ms (i.e. 
      transmission rate of 10 packets/second). Performance monitoring is 
      only relevant when the transport path is defect free. CC-V 
      contributes to the accuracy of PM statistics by permitting the 
      defect free periods to be properly distinguished. 

   o Protection Switching: default transmission period is 3.33ms (i.e. 
      transmission rate of 300 packets/second), in order to achieve sub-
      50ms the CC-V defect entry criteria should resolve in less than 
      10msec, and complete a protection switch within a subsequent 
      period of 50 msec.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   It SHOULD be possible for the operator to configure these 
   transmission rates for all applications, to satisfy his internal 
   requirements. 

   In addition, the operator should be able to define the consequent 
   action to be performed for each of these applications. 

5.2. Remote Defect Indication 

   The Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is an indicator that is 
   transmitted by a MEP to communicate to its peer MEPs that a signal 
   fail condition exists.  RDI is only used for bidirectional 
   connections and is associated with proactive CC-V activation. The RDI 
   indicator is piggy-backed onto the CC-V packet. 

   When a MEP detects a signal fail condition (e.g. in case of a 
   continuity or connectivity defect), it should begin transmitting an 
   RDI indicator to its peer MEP.  The RDI information will be included 
   in all pro-active CC-V packets that it generates for the duration of 
   the signal fail condition's existence. 

   [Editor's note - Add some forward compatibility information to cover 
   the case where future OAM mechanisms that contributes to the signal 
   fail detection (and RDI generation) are defined.] 

   A MEP that receives the packets with the RDI information should 
   determine that its peer MEP has encountered a defect condition 
   associated with a signal fail. 

   MIPs as well as intermediate nodes not supporting MPLS-TP OAM are 
   transparent to the RDI indicator and forward these proactive CC-V 
   packets that include the RDI indicator as regular data packets, i.e. 
   the MIP should not perform any actions nor examine the indicator. 

   When the signal fail defect condition clears, the MEP should clear 
   the RDI indicator from subsequent transmission of pro-active CC-V 
   packets.  A MEP should clear the RDI defect upon reception of a pro-
   active CC-V packet from the source MEP with the RDI indicator 
   cleared. 

5.2.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support RDI indication, this may be a unique OAM message 
   or an OAM information element embedded in a CV message. In this case 
   the RDI transmission rate and PHB of the OAM packets carrying RDI 
   should be the same as that configured for  CC-V.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

5.2.2. Applications for Remote Defect Indication 

   RDI is applicable for the following applications: 

   o Single-ended fault management - A MEP that receives an RDI 
      indication from its peer MEP, can report a far-end defect 
      condition (i.e. the peer MEP has detected a signal fail condition 
      in the traffic direction from the MEP that receives the RDI 
      indication to the peer MEP that has sent the RDI information).  

   o Contribution to far-end performance monitoring - The indication of 
      the far-end defect condition is used as a contribution to the 
      bidirectional performance monitoring process. 

5.3. Alarm Reporting 

   The Alarm Reporting function relies upon an Alarm Indication Signal 
   (AIS) message used to suppress alarms following detection of defect 
   conditions at the server (sub-)layer. 

   o A server MEP that detects a signal fail conditions in the server 
      (sub-)layer, will notify the MPLS-TP client (sub-)layer adaptation 
      function, which can generate packets with AIS information in a 
      direction opposite to its peers MEPs to allow the suppression of 
      secondary alarms at the MEP in the client (sub-)layer. 

   A server MEP is responsible for notifying the MPLS-TP layer network 
   adaptation function upon fault detection in the server layer network 
   to which the server MEP is associated. 

   Only the client layer adaptation function at an intermediate node 
   will issue MPLS-TP packets with AIS information. Upon receiving 
   notification of a signal fail condition the adaptation function 
   SHOULD immediately start transmitting periodic packets with AIS 
   information. These periodic packets, with AIS information, continue 
   to be transmitted until the signal fail condition is cleared. 

   Upon receiving a packet with AIS information an MPLS-TP MEP enters an 
   AIS defect condition and suppresses loss of continuity alarms 
   associated with its peer MEP. A MEP resumes loss of continuity alarm 
   generation upon detecting loss of continuity defect conditions in the 
   absence of AIS condition. 

   For example, let's consider a fiber cut between LSR 1 and LSR 2 in 
   the reference network of Figure 3. Assuming that all the MEGs 
   described in Figure 3 have pro-active CC-V enabled, a LOC defect is 
   detected by the MEPs of Sec12 SME, PSN13 LME, PW1 PTCME and PW1Z PME, 
 
 
Busi et al.             Expires June 10, 2010                [Page 35] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   however in transport network only the alarm associate to the fiber 
   cut needs to be reported to NMS while all these secondary alarms 
   should be suppressed (i.e. not reported to the NMS or reported as 
   secondary alarms). 

   If the fiber cut is detected by the MEP in the physical layer (in 
   LSR2), LSR2 can generate the proper alarm in the physical layer and 
   suppress the secondary alarm associated with the LOC defect detected 
   on Sec12 SME. As both MEPs reside within the same node, this process 
   does not involve any external protocol exchange. Otherwise, if the 
   physical layer has not enough OAM capabilities to detect the fiber 
   cut, the MEP of Sec12 SME in LSR2 will report a LOC alarm. 

   In both cases, the MEP of Sec12 SME in LSR 2 notifies the adaptation 
   function for PSN13 LME that then generates AIS packets on the PSN13 
   LME in order to allow its MEP in LSR3 to suppress the LOC alarm. LSR3 
   can also suppress the secondary alarm on PW13 PPSTME because the MEP 
   of PW13 PPSTME resides within the same node as the MEP of PSN13 LME. 
   The MEP of PW13 PPSTME in LSR3 also notifies the adaptation function 
   for PW1Z PME that then generates AIS packets on PW1Z PME in order to 
   allow its MEP in LSRZ to suppress the LOC alarm. 

   The generation of AIS packets for each MEG in the client (sub-)layer 
   is configurable (i.e. the operator can enable/disable the AIS 
   generation). 

   AIS packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss probability PHB" 
   within a single network operator. This PHB is configurable on network 
   operator's basis. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with AIS information and therefore 
   does not require any information to support AIS functionality. 

5.4. Lock Reporting 

   To be incorporated in a future revision of this document 

5.5. Packet Loss Monitoring 

   Packet Loss Monitoring (LM) is one of the capabilities supported by 
   the MPLS-TP Performance Monitoring (PM) function in order to 
   facilitate reporting of QoS information for a transport path. LM is 
   used to exchange counter values for the number of ingress and egress 
   packets transmitted and received by the transport path monitored by a 
   pair of MEPs.   


 
 
Busi et al.             Expires June 10, 2010                [Page 36] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   Proactive LM is performed by periodically sending LM OAM packets from 
   a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving LM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during the life time of the 
   transport path. Each MEP performs measurements of its transmitted and 
   received packets. These measurements are then transactionally 
   correlated with the peer MEP in the ME to derive the impact of packet 
   loss on a number of performance metrics for the ME in the MEG. The LM 
   transactions are issued such that the OAM packets will experience the 
   same queuing discipline as the measured traffic while transiting 
   between the MEPs in the ME. 

   For a MEP, near-end packet loss refers to packet loss associated with 
   incoming data packets (from the far-end MEP) while far-end packet 
   loss refers to packet loss associated with egress data packets 
   (towards the far-end MEP).  

5.5.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support proactive LM, the transmission rate and PHB 
   associated with the LM OAM packets originating from a MEP need be 
   configured as part of the LM provisioning procedures. LM OAM packets 
   should be transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet loss 
   performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordered Aggregates 
   (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the monitored transport path for the relevant 
   network domain(s).  

5.5.2. Applications for Packet Loss Monitoring 

   LM is relevant for the following applications: 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      packet loss performance of a transport path for Service Level 
      Agreement (SLA) verification purposes. 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      packet loss performance of a PHB Scheduling Class or Ordered 
      Aggregate within a transport path. 

   o Contribution to service unable time. Both near-end and far-end 
      packet loss measurements contribute to performance metrics such as 
      near-end severely errored seconds (Near-End SES) and far-end 
      severely errored seconds (Far-End SES) respectively, which 
      together contribute to unavailable time, in a manner similar to 
      Recommendation G.826 [19] and Recommendation G.7710 [20].

5.6. Client Signal Failure Indication 

   The Client Signal Failure Indication (CSF) function is used to help 
   process client defects and propagate a client signal defect condition 
   from the process associated with the local attachment circuit where 
   the defect was detected (typically the source adaptation function for 
   the local client interface) to the process associated with the far-
   end attachment circuit (typically the source adaptation function for 
   the far-end client interface) for the same transmission path in case 
   the client of the transmission path does not support a native 
   defect/alarm indication mechanism, e.g. FDI/AIS. 

   [Editor's note - The need to support this function on the LSP layer 
   (and not only at the PW layer) needs to be further investigated. 
   Pending discussion on MPLS-TP clients in the main framework 
   document.] 

   A source MEP starts transmitting a CSF indication to its peer MEP 
   when it receives a local client signal defect notification via its 
   local CSF function. Mechanisms to detect local client signal fail 
   defects are technology specific. 

   A sink MEP that has received a CSF indication report this condition 
   to its associated client process via its local CSF function. 
   Consequent actions toward the client attachment circuit are 
   technology specific. 

   Either there needs to be a 1:1 correspondence between the client and 
   the MEG, or when multiple clients are multiplexed over a transport 
   path, the CSF message requires additional information to permit the 
   client instance to be identified. 

5.6.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support CSF indication, the CSF transmission rate and PHB 
   of the CSF OAM message/information element should be configured as 
   part of the CSF configuration.  

5.6.2. Applications for Client Signal Failure Indication 

   CSF is applicable for the following applications: 

   o Single-ended fault management - A MEP that receives a CSF 
      indication from its peer MEP, can report a far-end client defect 
      condition (i.e. the peer MEP has been informed of local client 
      signal fail condition in the traffic direction from the client to 
      the peer MEP that transmitted the CSF).

      the far-end defect condition may be used to account on network 
      operator contribution to the bidirectional performance monitoring 
      process.  

   CSF supports the application described in Appendix VIII of ITU-T 
   G.806 [18]. 

5.7. Delay Measurement 

   Delay Measurement (DM) is one of the capabilities supported by the 
   MPLS-TP PM function in order to facilitate reporting of QoS 
   information for a transport path. Specifically, pro-active DM is used 
   to measure the long-term packet delay and packet delay variation in 
   the transport path monitored by a pair of MEPs.   

   Proactive DM is performed by sending periodic DM OAM packets from a 
   MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving DM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during a configurable time 
   interval.  

   Pro-active DM can be operated in two ways: 

   o One-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet to its peer MEP containing all 
      the required information to facilitate one-way packet delay and/or 
      one-way packet delay variation measurements at the peer MEP. Note 
      that this requires synchronized precision time at either MEP by 
      means outside the scope of this framework. 

   o Two-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet with a DM request to its peer 
      MEP, which replies with a DM OAM packet as a DM response. The 
      request/response DM OAM packets containing all the required 
      information to facilitate two-way packet delay and/or two-way 
      packet delay variation measurements from the viewpoint of the 
      source MEP. 

5.7.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support pro-active DM, the transmission rate and PHB 
   associated with the DM OAM packets originating from a MEP need be 
   configured as part of the DM provisioning procedures. DM OAM packets 
   should be transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet loss 
   performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordered Aggregates 
   (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the monitored transport path for the relevant 
   network domain(s).

5.7.2. Applications for Delay Measurement 

   DM is relevant for the following applications: 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      delay performance of a transport path for SLA verification 
      purposes. 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      delay performance of a PHB Scheduling Class or Ordered Aggregate 
      within a transport path 

6. OAM Functions for on-demand monitoring 

   [Editors' note: at the beginning of each section, reference the 
   section in the OAM Requirements document and explicitly list 
   additional detailed requirements wrt the OAM Requirements document] 

   In contrast to proactive monitoring, on-demand monitoring is 
   initiated manually and for a limited amount of time, usually for 
   operations such as e.g. diagnostics to investigate into a defect 
   condition. 

6.1. Connectivity Verification 

   In order to preserve network resources, e.g. bandwidth, processing 
   time at switches, it may be preferable to not use proactive CC-V. In 
   order to perform fault management functions, network management may 
   invoke periodic on-demand bursts of on-demand CV packets. 

   Use of on-demand CV is dependent on the existence of a bi-directional 
   MEG, because it requires the presence of a return path in the data 
   plane.[Editors': needs to be revised on the basis of the return path 
   discussion (discussion item 7 in section 1.2] 

   [Editor's note - Clarify in the sentence above and within the 
   paragraph that on-demand CV requires a return path to send back the 
   reply to on-demand CV packets] 

   An additional use of on-demand CV would be to detect and locate a 
   problem of connectivity when a problem is suspected or known based on 
   other tools.  In this case the functionality will be triggered by the 
   network management in response to a status signal or alarm 
   indication. 

   On-demand CV is based upon generation of on-demand CV packets that 
   should uniquely identify the MEG that is being checked.  The on-

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   demand functionality may be used to check either an entire MEG (end-
   to-end) or between a MEP to a specific MIP. This functionality may 
   not be available for associated bidirectional paths as the MIP may 
   not have a return path to the source MEP for the on-demand CV 
   transaction. 

   On-demand CV may generate a one-time burst of on-demand CV packets, 
   or be used to invoke periodic, non-continuous, bursts of on-demand CV 
   packets.  The number of packets generated in each burst is 
   configurable at the MEPs, and should take into account normal packet-
   loss conditions.  

   When invoking a periodic check of the MEG, the source MEP should 
   issue a burst of on-demand CV packets that uniquely identifies the 
   MEG being verified.  The number of packets and their transmission 
   rate should be pre-configured and known to both the source MEP and 
   the target MEP or MIP.  The source MEP should use the TTL field to 
   indicate the number of hops necessary, when targeting a MIP and use 
   the default value when performing an end-to-end check [IB => This is 
   quite generic for addressing packets to MIPs and MEPs so it is better 
   to move this text in section 2].  The target MEP/MIP shall return a 
   reply on-demand CV packet for each packet received.  If the expected 
   number of on-demand CV reply packets is not received at source MEP, 
   the LOC defect state is entered. 

   [Editor's note - We need to add some text for the usage of on-demand 
   CV with different packet sizes, e.g. to discover MTU problems.] 

6.1.1. Configuration considerations 

   For on-demand CV the MEP should support the configuration of the 
   number of packets to be transmitted/received in each burst of 
   transmissions and their packet size. The transmission rate should be 
   configured between the different nodes. 

   In addition, when the CV packet is used to check connectivity toward 
   a target MIP, the number of hops to reach the target MIP should be 
   configured. 

   The PHB of the on-demand CV packets should be configured as well. 

   [Editor's note - We need to be better define the reason for such 
   configuration]

6.2. Packet Loss Monitoring 

   On-demand Packet Loss (LM) is one of the capabilities supported by 
   the MPLS-TP Performance Monitoring function in order to facilitate 
   diagnostic of QoS performance for a transport path. As proactive LM, 
   on-demand LM is used to exchange counter values for the number of 
   ingress and egress packets transmitted and received by the transport 
   path monitored by a pair of MEPs.   

   On-demand LM is performed by periodically sending LM OAM packets from 
   a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving LM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during a pre-defined monitoring 
   period. Each MEP performs measurements of its transmitted and 
   received packets. These measurements are then correlated evaluate the 
   packet loss performance metrics of the transport path. 

6.2.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support on-demand LM, the beginning and duration of the 
   LM procedures, the transmission rate and PHB associated with the LM 
   OAM packets originating from a MEP must be configured as part of the 
   on-demand LM provisioning procedures. LM OAM packets should be 
   transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet loss 
   performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordered Aggregates 
   (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the monitored transport path for the relevant 
   network domain(s).  

6.2.2. Applications for On-demand Packet Loss Monitoring 

   On-demand LM is relevant for the following applications: 

   o Single-end performance monitoring: diagnostic of the packet loss 
      performance of a transport path for SLA trouble shooting purposes. 

   o Single-end performance monitoring: diagnostic of the packet loss 
      performance of a PHB Scheduling Class or Ordering Aggregate within 
      a transport path for QoS trouble shooting purposes.

   also needed to understand whether it is needed to specify where this 
   data-plane loopback takes place within the equipment] 

   [Munich: Need to describe the two types of loopback - LBM/LBR and 
   traffic loopback enhanced with variable sized packets in the on 
   demand cases. 

   One objective of diags is fault location, we need to make clear how 
   we apply the tools to fault location. 

   At the top of each section we need to describe the detailed 
   requirements and then in the rest of the section describe how it is 
   met.] 

6.4. Route Tracing 

   [Editors' note: The framework needs to say what you need to trace and 
   not how you do it (remove the description of the solution).] 

   [Editors' note: Need to investigate if we need both tracing options: 
   describe why and a sketch of the two options and their properties. 

   Possible reasons for both options: 

   o TTL incremental tells whether the CP is correct or not 

   o the second one (path discovery) is ... 

   Action: check on the mailing list the need to support both modes of 
   operations.] 

   After e.g. provisioning an MPLS-TP LSP or for trouble shooting 
   purposes, it is often necessary to trace a route covered by an ME 
   from a source MEP to the sink MEP including all the MIPs in-between. 
   The route tracing function is providing this functionality. Based on 
   the fate sharing requirement of OAM flows, i.e. OAM packets receive 
   the same forwarding treatment as data packet, route tracing is a 
   basic means to perform CV and, to a much lesser degree, CC. For this 
   function to work properly, a return path must be present. 

   Route tracing might be implemented in different ways and this 
   document does not preclude any of them. Route trace could be 
   implemented e.g. by an MPLS traceroute-like function [RFC4379]. 
   However, route tracing should always return the full list of MIPs and 
   the peer MEP in it answer(s). In case a defect exist, the route trace 
   function needs to be able to detect it and stop automatically

   returning the incomplete list of OAM entities that it was able to 
   trace. 

   The configuration of the route trace function must at least support 
   the setting of the trace depth (number of hops)_and the number of 
   trace attempts before it gives up. Default setting need to be 
   configurable by the operator, too. 

6.5. Delay Measurement 

   Delay Measurement (DM) is one of the capabilities supported by the 
   MPLS-TP PM function in order to facilitate reporting of QoS 
   information for a transport path. Specifically, on-demand DM is used 
   to measure packet delay and packet delay variation in the transport 
   path monitored by a pair of MEPs during a pre-defined monitoring 
   period.   

   On-Demand DM is performed by sending periodic DM OAM packets from a 
   MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving DM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during a configurable time 
   interval.  

   On-demand DM can be operated in two ways: 

   o One-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet to its peer MEP containing all 
      the required information to facilitate one-way packet delay and/or 
      one-way packet delay variation measurements at the peer MEP. 

   o Two-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet with a DM request to its peer 
      MEP, which replies with an DM OAM packet as a DM response. The 
      request/response DM OAM packets containing all the required 
      information to facilitate two-way packet delay and/or two-way 
      packet delay variation measurements from the viewpoint of the 
      source MEP. 

6.5.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support on-demand DM, the beginning and duration of the 
   DM procedures, the transmission rate and PHB associated with the DM 
   OAM packets originating from a MEP need be configured as part of the 
   LM provisioning procedures. DM OAM packets should be transmitted with 
   the PHB that yields the lowest packet delay performance among the PHB 
   Scheduling Classes or Ordering Aggregates (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the 
   monitored transport path for the relevant network domain(s).

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework            December 2009 
    

   In order to verify different performances between long and short 
   packets (e.g., due to the processing time), it SHOULD be possible for 
   the operator to configure of the on-demand OAM DM packet. 

6.5.2. Applications for Delay Measurement 

   DM is relevant for the following applications: 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      packet delay and/or delay variation performance of a transport 
      path for SLA verification purposes. 

   o Single or double-end performance monitoring: determination of the 
      packet delay and/or delay variation a PHB Scheduling Class or 
      Ordering Aggregate within a transport path 

   o Contribution to service unable time. Packet delay measurements may 
      contribute to performance metrics such as near-end severely 
      errored seconds (Near-End SES) and far-end severely errored 
      seconds (Far-End SES), which together contribute to unavailable 
      time.

7. Security Considerations 

   A number of security considerations are important in the context of 
   OAM applications.  

   OAM traffic can reveal sensitive information such as passwords, 
   performance data and details about e.g. the network topology. The 
   nature of OAM data therefore suggests to have some form of 
   authentication, authorization and encryption in place. This will 
   prevent unauthorized access to vital equipment and it will prevent 
   third parties from learning about sensitive information about the 
   transport network. 

   Mechanisms that the framework does not specify might be subject to 
   additional security considerations. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   No new IANA considerations.

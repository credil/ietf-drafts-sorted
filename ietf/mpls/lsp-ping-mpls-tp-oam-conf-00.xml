      <t>This specification describes the configuration of pro-active MPLS-TP Operations,

    <section title="Introduction">
  
      <t>This document describes the configuration of pro-active MPLS-TP Operations, 
	Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Functions for a given LSP using a common 
	set of TLVs that can be carried on either RSVP-TE [RFC3209] or LSP Ping [BFD-Ping].  
	In particular it specifies the mechanisms necessary to establish MPLS-TP OAM 
	entities monitoring an LSP and defines information elements and procedures to 
	configure pro-active MPLS OAM functions.  Initialization and control of on-demand 
	MPLS OAM functions are expected to be carried out by directly accessing network nodes 
	via a management interface; hence configuration and control of on-demand OAM functions 
	are out-of-scope for this document.</t>

      <t>Because the Transport Profile of MPLS, by definition [RFC5654], must be capable 
	of operating without a control plane, there are two options for in-band OAM: by using 
	an NMS or by using LSP-Ping if a control plane is not instantiated.</t>

      <t>Pro-active MPLS OAM is based on the Bidirectional Forwarding
	Detection (BFD) protocol [BFD].  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
	(BFD), as described in [BFD], defines a protocol that provides low-
	overhead, short-duration detection of failures in the path between
	two forwarding engines, including the interfaces, data link(s), and
	to the extent possible the forwarding engines themselves.  BFD can be
	used to track the liveliness and detect data plane failures of MPLS-TP point-to-point 
	and might also be extended to p2mp connections.</t>

      <t>MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes a profile of MPLS that
	enables operational models typical in transport networks, while
	providing additional OAM, survivability and other maintenance
	functions not currently supported by MPLS.  [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ] defines the requirements 
	for the OAM functionality of MPLS-TP.</t>

      <t>BFD has been chosen to be the basis of pro-active MPLS-TP OAM functions. 
	MPLS-TP OAM extensions for transport applications, for which this document specifies 
	the configuration, are specified in [BFD-CCCV], [MPLS-PM], and [MPLS-FMS].</t>

      <section title="Overview of BFD OAM operation"> 
	<t>BFD is a simple hello protocol that in many respects is similar to
	  the detection components of well-known routing protocols.  A pair of systems transmits BFD packets periodically over each path between the
	  two systems, and if a system stops receiving BFD packets for long
	  enough, some component in that particular bidirectional path to the
	  neighboring system is assumed to have failed.  Systems may also
	  negotiate to not send periodic BFD packets in order to reduce
	  overhead.</t>

	<t>A path is only declared to be operational when two-way communication 
	  has been established between systems, though this does not preclude
	  the use of unidirectional links to support bidirectional paths 
	  (co-routed or bidirectional or associated bidirectional).</t>

	<t>Each system estimates how quickly it can send and receive BFD packets
	  in order to come to an agreement with its neighbor about how rapidly
	  detection of failure will take place.  These estimates can be
	  modified in real time in order to adapt to unusual situations.  This
	  design also allows for fast systems on a shared medium with a slow
	  system to be able to more rapidly detect failures between the fast
	  systems while allowing the slow system to participate to the best of
	  its ability.</t>

	<t>The ability of each system to control the BFD packet transmission
	  rate in both directions provides a mechanism for congestion control,
	  particularly when BFD is used across multiple network hops.</t>

	<t>As recommended in [BFD-CCCV], the BFD tool needs to be extended for the
	  proactive CV functionality by the addition of an unique identifier in order to meet the requirements.  The document in [BFD-CCCV] specifies the BFD
	  extension and behavior to meet the requirements for MPLS-TP proactive
	  Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification functionality and the
	  RDI functionality as defined in [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ].</t>

    <section title="Overview of MPLS OAM for Transport Applications">
      <t>[MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK] describes how MPLS OAM mechanisms are operated 
	to meet transport requirements outlined in [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ].</t>
      
      <t>[BFD-CCCV] specifies two BFD operation modes: 1) "CC mode", 
	which uses periodic BFD message exchanges with symmetric timer settings, 
	supporting Continuity Check, 2) "CV/CC mode" which sends unique 
	maintenance entity identifiers in the periodic BFD messages supporting 
	Connectivity Verification as well as Continuity Check.</t>
      
      <t>[MPLS-PM] specifies mechanisms for performance monitoring of LSPs, 
	in particular it specifies loss and delay measurement OAM functions.</t>
      
      <t>[MPLS-FMS] specifies fault management signals with which a server 
	LSP can notify client LSPs about various fault conditions to suppress 
	alarms or to be used as triggers for actions in the client LSPs. 
	The following signals are defined: Alarm Indication Signal (AIS),
	Link Down Indication (LDI) and Locked Report (LKR). To indicate client 
	faults associated with the attachment circuits Client Signal Failure 
	Indication (CSF) can be used. CSF is described in [MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK]
	and in the context of this document is for further study.</t>
      
      <t>[MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK] describes the mapping of fault conditions to 
	consequent actions. Some of these mappings may be configured by the 
	operator, depending on the application of the LSP. The following defects 
	are identified: Loss Of Continuity (LOC), Misconnectivity, 
	MEP Misconfiguration and Period Misconfiguration. Out of these defect 
	conditions, the following consequent actions may be configurable: 
	1) whether or not the LOC defect should result in blocking the outgoing 
	data traffic; 2) whether or not the "Period Misconfiguration defect" 
	should result a signal fail condition.</t>

      <section title="MPLS OAM Configuration Operation Overview">

	<t>Refer to section 3.1 of [RSVP-TE CONF] for the applicability scenarios description and their related configurations and mechanisms. In fact, each of them can be completely reused in case of LSP Ping configuration as well as already done for RSVP-TE. </t>

<t>The only exception is that LSP Ping needs an extra TLV to carry the information required for the "CV/CC mode" OAM [BFD-CCCV] and defined in [MPLS-TP-IDENTIF]. Such information is supplied by an additional sub-TLV as defined in section 3.3. </t>

      </section>

<section title="TLVs structure">
<t>
LSP Ping follows the same TLV structure defined for RSVP-TE in [RSVP-TE CONF] from section 3.2 to section 3.6.
</t>

<t>
In addition, an extra TLV is defined "MPLS OAM SOURCE MEP-ID TLV" in order to supply the information needed for the Connectivity Verification 
functionality. In fact, RSVP-TE does not need such TLV because it already encodes this information in other mandatory objects 
already included in its messages.
</t>

<t>
The MPLS OAM SOURCE MEP-ID TLV is intended to be inserted in the scope of the "OAM configuration TLV" together with the othe sub-TLV as defined in 
[RSVP-TE CONF] section 3.2.
</t>

</section>

	<section title="MPLS OAM SOURCE MEP-ID TLV for LSP Ping">
	  <t>The "MPLS OAM SOURCE MEP-ID TLV for LSP Ping" depicted below is carried as a sub-TLV of the

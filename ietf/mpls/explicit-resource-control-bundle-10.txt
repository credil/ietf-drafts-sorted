    Abstract 
        
       Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been used 
       extensively by the service providers. However, when TE links are 
       bundled, identification of label resource in Record Route object 
       (RRO) is not sufficient to determine the component link within a TE 
       link that is being used by a given LSP. In other words, when link 
       bundling is used, resource recording requires mechanisms to specify 
       the component link identifier, along with the TE link identifier and 
       Label. As it is not possible to record component link in the RRO, 
       this document defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and 
       [RFC3473] to specify component link identifiers for resource 
       recording purposes.

    Component Link Recording & Resource Control for TE Links April 27, 2011 

        
       This document also defines the Explicit Route object (ERO) 
       counterpart of the RRO extension. The ERO extensions are needed to 
       perform explicit label/resource control over bundled TE link. 
       Hence, this document defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209]  
       and [RFC3473] to specify component link identifiers for explicit 
       resource control and recording over TE link bundles.

    Component Link Recording & Resource Control for TE Links April 27, 2011 
        
        
    1. Introduction 
        
       In GMPLS networks [RFC3945] where unbundled (being either Packet-
       Switching Capable, Layer2-Switching Capable, Time Division 
       Multiplexing or Lambda-Switching Capable) Traffic Engineering (TE) 
       Links are used, one of the types of resources that an LSP originator 
       could control and record are the component links used by non-
       neighboring nodes on the LSP path. The resource control and 
       recording is done by the use of the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (ERO) and 
       RECORD_ROUTE object (RRO), respectively.    
        
       Link Bundling, introduced in [RFC4201], is used to improve routing 
       scalability by reducing the amount of TE related information that 
       need to be flooded and handled by IGP in a TE network. This is 
       accomplished by aggregating and abstracting the TE Link components. 
       In some cases the component link selection/recording within a TE 
       link is left as a local decision (ERO and RRO contains only TE 
       links). However there are cases when it is desirable for a non-local 
       (e.g., LSP head-end) node to make this selection. The use of such 
       information has found since so far three main applications (while 
       not excluding others unknown at the time of writing): diagnostic, 
       association of component specific attributes for which the bundled 
       information is too coarse (e.g., Shared Risk Link Groups) and thus 
       blocking SRLG-disjoint LSP establishment, allocation of labels at 
       network edges, and notification in case of failures. The latter is 
       useful when a single TE link interconnects two parts of the network. 
       In case one of its components fails notifying a complete TE link 
       failure leaves the network disconnected. In either case, it is 
       required to know which component link within a bundled TE link has 
       been used for a given LSP. For these cases, the TE Link and the 
       Label currently specified in the ERO/RRO are not enough and the
       component link needs to be specified along with the label. In the
       case of bi-directional Label Switched Paths (LSP) both upstream 
       and downstream information may be specified. Therefore, explicit 
       resource control and recording over a bundled TE link also requires 
       ability to specify a component link within the TE link.   
        
       Another important assumption of this document is that the identifier 
       space used for component link identification are unique for a given 
       node (following [RFC4201]). The reason stems as follows: most 
       experimental developments started with TE links composed by a single 
       component link and then only bundling was added by grouping them. 
       Component links where thus identified such that they could mimic the 
       behavior of TE link processing. This also justifies the experimental 
       status of this document. 
         
       This document defines extensions to and describes the use of RSVP-TE

       [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473] to specify the component link 
       identifier for resource recording and explicit resource control over 
       TE link bundles. Specifically, in this document, component interface 
       identifier RRO and ERO subobjects are defined to complement their 
       Label RRO and ERO counterparts. Furthermore, procedures for 
       processing component interface identifier RRO and ERO subobjects and 
       how they can co-exist with the Label RRO and ERO subobjects are 
       specified.   
     
    Conventions used in this document 
        
       In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
       server respectively. 
        
       The key words "MUST", "MUST NoT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
       document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].  
        
       In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
       only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    
       interpreted as carrying RFC 2119 significance. 
        
       In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)   
       indicates a compliance requirement statement using the key words    
       listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying   
       or finding the explicit compliance requirements of this RFC. 
        
    2. Terminology 
        
       o) TE Link: Unless specified otherwise, it refers to a bundled 
       Traffic Engineering link as defined in [RFC4201]. Furthermore, the 
       terms TE Link and bundled TE Link are used interchangeably in this 
       document.    
                
       o) Component (interface) link: refers (locally) to a link that is   
       part of a bundled TE link as described in RFC4201.  
                
       o) Component Interface Identifier: Refers to an ID used to uniquely 
       identify a Component Interface. on a bundled link a combination of   
       <component link identifier, label> is sufficient to unambiguously  
       identify the appropriate resources used by an LSP. The IDs used for 
       component link identification are unique for a given node [RFC4201]. 
        
    3. LSP Resource Recording 
        
       LSP Resource Recording refers to the ability to record the resources  
       used by an LSP.

    Component Link Recording & Resource Control for TE Links April 27, 2011 
  
      
       The procedure for unbundled numbered TE links is described in  
       [RFC3209] and for unbundled unnumbered TE links in [RFC3477]. For 
       the purpose of recording LSP resources used over bundled TE Links, 
       the Component Interface Identifier RRO sub-object is introduced.    
               
    3.1. Component Interface Identifier RRO subobject   
                 
       A new subobject of the Record Route object (RRO) is used to record  
       component interface identifier of a (bundled) TE Link. This 
       subobject has the following format:    
                     
         0                   1                   2                   3

        //   IPv4, IPv6 or unnumbered Component Interface Identifier   //   
        |                            . . .                              |   
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+    
            
        L: 1 bit   
                
           This bit must be set to 0.   
                
        Type   
                
           Type 10 (TBD): Component Interface identifier IPv4

           Component Link Record. & Resource Control for TE Link Bundles    
                 
           The Length contains the total length of the subobject in   
           bytes, including the Type and Length fields. The Length is   
           8 bytes for the Component Interface identifier IPv4 and   
           Component Interface identifier Unnumbered types. For   
           Component Interface identifier IPv6 type of sub-object, the   
           length field is 20 bytes.   
                         
        U: 1 bit   
                
           This bit indicates the direction of the component interface.  
           It is set to 0 for the downstream interface.  
           It is set to 1 for the upstream interface and is only used for   
           bi-directional LSPs.

    3.2. Processing of Component Interface identifier RRO Subobject   
                 
       If a node desires component link recording, the "Component Link   
       Recording desired" flag (value TBD) should be set in the  
       LSP_ATTRIBUTES object, object that is defined in [RFC5420].   
            
       Setting of "Component Link Recording desired" flag is independent of  
       the Label Recording flag in SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object as specified in   
       [RFC3209]. Nevertheless, the following combinations are valid:   
            
       1) If both Label and Component Link flags are clear, then neither   
          Labels nor Component Links are recorded.   
                  
       2) If Label Recording flag is set and Component Link flag is   
          clear, then only Label Recording is performed as defined in   
          [RFC3209].   
                  
       3) If Label Recording flag is clear and Component Link flag is   
          set, then Component Link Recording is performed as defined in  
          this document.   
                  
       4) If both Label Recording and Component Link flags are set, then   
          Label Recording is performed as defined in [RFC3209] and also   
          Component Link recording is performed as defined in this  
          document.   
                
       In most cases, a node initiates recording for a given LSP by adding  
       the RRO to the Path message. If the node desires Component Link  
       recording and if the outgoing TE link is bundled, then the initial  
       RRO contains the Component Link identifier (numbered or unnumbered)  
       as selected by the sender. As well, the Component Link Recording  
       desired flag is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTE object. If the node also  
       desires label recording, it sets the Label_Recording flag in the  
       SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object.  
            
       When a Path message with the "Component Link Recording desired" flag  
       set is received by an intermediate node, if a new Path message is to  
       be sent for a downstream bundled TE link, the node adds a new  
       Component Link subobject to the RECORD_ROUTE object (RRO) and 
       appends the resulting RRO to the Path message before transmission.   
       Note also that, unlike Labels, Component Link identifiers are always 
       known on receipt of the Path message.   
                
       When the destination node of an RSVP session receives a Path message  
       with an RRO and the "Component Link Recording desired" flag set, 
       this indicates that the sender node needs TE route as well as 
       component link recording. The destination node initiates the RRO

       process by adding an RRO to Resv messages. The processing mirrors 
       that of the Path messages. The Component Interface Record subobject 
       is pushed onto the RECORD_ROUTE object (RRO) prior to pushing on the 
       node"s IP address. A node MUST NOT push on a Component Interface 
       Record subobject without also pushing on the IP address or 
       unnumbered Interface Id subobject that identifies the TE Link.   
                
       When component interfaces are recorded for unidirectional LSPs, the 
       downstream interface is the one identified by the Component 
       Interface subobject. For bi-directional LSPs, component interface 
       RRO subobjects for both downstream and upstream interfaces MUST be 
       included.  
        
    4. Signaling Component Interface Identifier in ERO
        
    4.1. Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject

       A new oPTIoNAL subobject of the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (ERO) is used  
       to specify component interface identifier of a bundled TE Link.    
       This Component Interface Identifier subobject has the following  
       format:    
                    
         0                   1                   2                   3

        |                                                               |  
        //  IPv4, IPv6 or unnumbered Component Interface Identifier    //   
        |                            . . .                              |

         L: 1 bit   
                
            This bit must be set to 0.

            8 bytes for the Component Interface identifier types: IPv4   
            and Component Interface identifier Unnumbered. For Component

    4.2. Processing of Component Interface Identifier ERO Subobject   
                   
       The Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject follows a subobject  
       containing the IP address, or the link identifier [RFC3477],  
       associated with the TE link on which it is to be used. It is used to  
       identify the component of a bundled TE Link.   
                
       The following SHOULD result in "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error  
       being sent upstream by a node processing an ERO that contains the   
       Component Interface ID sub-object:   
                
       o) The first component interface identifier subobject is not   
          preceded by a sub-object containing an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or   
          an interface identifier [RFC3477], associated with a TE link.   
                  
       o) The Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject follows a   
          subobject that has the L-bit set.   
            
       o) on unidirectional LSP setup, there is a Component Interface   
          Identifier ERO subobject with the U-bit set.   
                  
       o) Two Component Interface Identifier ERO subobjects with the same   
          U-bit values exist.   
                   
       If a node implements the component interface identifier subobject, 
       it MUST check if it represents a component interface in the bundled 
       TE Link specified in the preceding subobject that contains the 
       IPv4/IPv6 address or interface identifier of the TE Link. If the 
       content of the component interface identifier subobject does not 
       match a component interface in the TE link, a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE 
       object" error SHOULD be reported as "Routing Problem" (error code 
       24).    
             
       If U-bit of the subobject being examined is cleared (0) and the  
       upstream interface specified in this subobject is acceptable, then  
       the value of the upstream component interface is translated locally 
       in the TLV of the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object [RFC3471]. The local  
       decision normally used to select the upstream component link is  
       bypassed except for local translation into the outgoing interface  
       identifier from the received incoming remote interface identifier.  

      
    A.Zamfir et al.       Expires October 26, 2011                [Page 8] 


    
    Component Link Recording & Resource Control for TE Links April 27, 2011 

        
       If this interface is not acceptable, a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" 
       error SHOULD be reported as "Routing Problem" (error code 24).     
                   
       If the U-bit of the subobject being examined is set (1), then the 
       value represents the component interface to be used for upstream 
       traffic associated with the bidirectional LSP. Again, if this 
       interface is not acceptable or if the request is not one for a 
       bidirectional LSP, then a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error SHOULD 
       be reported as "Routing Problem" (error code 24). otherwise, the 
       component interface IP address/ identifier is copied into a TLV sub-
       object as part of the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object. The local decision 
       normally used to select the upstream component link is bypassed 
       except for local translation into the outgoing interface identifier 
       from the received incoming remote interface identifier.   
                
       The IF_ID RSVP_HOP object constructed as above MUST be included in 
       the corresponding outgoing Path message.    
                
       Note that, associated with a TE Link sub-object in the ERO, either 
       the (remote) upstream component interface or the (remote) downstream 
       component interface or both may be specified. As specified in 
       [RFC4201] there is no relationship between the TE Link type 
       (numbered or unnumbered) and the Link type of any one of its 
       components.    
                
       The Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject is optional. 
       Similarly, presence of the Label ERO sub-objects is not mandatory   
       [RFC3471], [RFC3473]. Furthermore, component interface identifier  
       ERO subobject and Label ERO subobject may be included in the ERO 
       independently of each other. one of the following alternatives 
       applies:   
               
       o) When both sub-objects are absent, a node may select any   
          appropriate component link within the TE link and any label on  
          the selected component link.    
               
       o) When the Label subobject is only present for a bundled link, then   
          the selection of the component link within the bundle is a local   
          decision and the node may select any appropriate component link,   
          which can assume the label specified in the Label ERO.     
         
       o) When only the component interface identifier ERO subobject is   
          present, a node MUST select the component interface specified in   
          the ERO and may select any appropriate label value at the   
          specified component link.     
               
       o) When both component interface identifier ERO subobject and Label   
          ERO subobject are present, the node MUST select the locally

          corresponding component link and the specified label value on  
          that component link. When present, both subobjects may appear in  
          any relative order to each other but they MUST appear after the  
          TE Link subobject that they refer to.   
                
       After processing, the component interface identifier subobjects are  
       removed from the ERO.   
         
       Inferred from above, the interface subobject should never be the 
       first subobject in a newly received message. If the component  
       interface subobject is the first subobject in a received ERO, then 
       it SHOULD be treated as a "Bad strict node" error.   
                
       Note: Information to construct the Component Interface ERO subobject  
       MAY come from the same mean used to populate the label ERO 
       subobject. Procedures by which an LSR at the head-end of an LSP 
       obtains the information needed to construct the Component Interface 
       subobject are outside the scope of this document.  
        
    5. Backward Compatibility 
        
       The extensions specified in this document do not affect the 
       processing of the RRO, ERO at nodes that do not support them. A node 
       that does not support the Component Interface RRO subobject but that 
       does support Label subobject SHOULD only insert the Label subobject 
       in the RRO as per [RFC3471] and [RFC3473].    
                
       A node that receives an ERO that contains a Component Link ID  
       subobject SHOULD send "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" if it does not  
       implement this subobject.   
                
       Per [RFC3209], Section 4.4.5, a non-compliant node that receives an  
       RRO that contains Component Interface Identifier sub-objects should 
       ignore and pass them on. This limits the full applicability of if 
       nodes traversed by the LSP are compliant with the proposed  
       extensions.   
        
    6. Security Considerations 
        
       An implementation of the extensions described in this document does 
       exposes the component interface identifiers to other nodes in the 
       network. If this is considered confidential information the 
       mechanisms described in [RFC5920] should be considered.    
        
    7. IANA Considerations

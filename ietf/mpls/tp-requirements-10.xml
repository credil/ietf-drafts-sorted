    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile
      (MPLS-TP). This document is a product of a joint International
      Telecommunications Union (ITU)-IETF effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
      capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
      defined by International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T).</t>

      <t>This work is based on two sources of requirements; MPLS and PWE3
      architectures as defined by IETF, and packet transport networks as
      defined by ITU-T.</t>

      <t>The requirements expressed in this document are for the behavior of
      the protocol mechanisms and procedures that constitute building blocks
      out of which the MPLS transport profile is constructed. The requirements
      are not implementation requirements.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Bandwidth demand continues to grow worldwide, stimulated by the
      accelerating growth and penetration of new packet based services and
      multimedia applications:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Packet-based services such as Ethernet, Voice over IP (VoIP),
          Layer 2 (L2)/Layer 3 (L3) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), IP
          Television (IPTV), Radio Access Network (RAN) backhauling, etc.,</t>

          <t>Applications with various bandwidth and Quality of Service (QoS)
          requirements.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This growth in demand has resulted in dramatic increases in access
      rates that are, in turn, driving dramatic increases in metro and core
      network bandwidth requirements.</t>

      <t>Over the past two decades, the evolving optical transport
      infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET)/Synchronous
      Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Optical Transport Network (OTN)) has provided
      carriers with a high benchmark for reliability and operational
      simplicity.</t>

      <t>With the movement towards packet based services, the transport
      network has to evolve to encompass the provision of packet aware
      capabilities while enabling carriers to leverage their installed, as
      well as planned, transport infrastructure investments.</t>

      <t>Carriers are in need of technologies capable of efficiently
      supporting packet based services and applications on their transport
      networks with guaranteed Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The need to
      increase their revenue while remaining competitive forces operators to
      look for the lowest network Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Investment in
      equipment and facilities (Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)) and Operational
      Expenditure (OPEX) should be minimized.</t>

      <t>There are a number of technology options for carriers to meet the
      challenge of increased service sophistication and transport efficiency,
      with increasing usage of hybrid packet transport and circuit transport
      technology solutions. To realize these goals, it is essential that
      packet transport technology be available that can support the same high
      benchmarks for reliability and operational simplicity set by SDH/SONET
      and OTN technologies.</t>

      <t>Furthermore for carriers it is important that operation of such
      packet transport networks should preserve the look-and-feel to which
      carriers have become accustomed in deploying their optical transport
      networks, while providing common, multi-layer operations, resiliency,
      control and multi-technology management.</t>

      <t>Transport carriers require control and deterministic usage of network
      resources. They need end-to-end control to engineer network paths and to
      efficiently utilize network resources. They require capabilities to
      support static (management plane based) or dynamic (control plane based)
      provisioning of deterministic, protected and secured services and their
      associated resources.</t>

      <t>It is also important to ensure smooth interworking of the packet
      transport network with other existing/legacy packet networks, and
      provide mappings to enable packet transport carriage over a variety of
      transport network infrastructures. The latter has been termed vertical
      interworking, and is also known as client/server or network
      interworking. The former has been termed horizontal interworking, and is
      also known as peer-partition or service interworking. For more details
      on interworking and some of the issues that may arise (especially with
      horizontal interworking) see <xref target="ITU.G805.2000"> G.805</xref>
      and <xref target="ITU.Y1401.2008">Y.1401</xref>.</t>

      <t>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a maturing packet technology
      and it is already playing an important role in transport networks and
      services. However, not all of MPLS's capabilities and mechanisms are
      needed and/or consistent with transport network operations. There are
      also transport technology characteristics that are not currently
      reflected in MPLS. There is therefore the need to define an MPLS
      Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) that supports the capabilities and
      functionalities needed for packet transport network services and
      operations through combining the packet experience of MPLS with the
      operational experience and practices of existing transport networks.</t>

      <t>MPLS-TP will enable the deployment of packet based transport networks
      that will efficiently scale to support packet services in a simple and
      cost effective way. MPLS-TP needs to combine the necessary existing
      capabilities of MPLS with additional minimal mechanisms in order that it
      can be used in a transport role.</t>

      <t>This document specifies the requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile
      (MPLS-TP). The requirements are for the behavior of the protocol
      mechanisms and procedures that constitute building blocks out of which
      the MPLS transport profile is constructed. That is, the requirements
      indicate what features are to be available in the MPLS toolkit for use
      by MPLS-TP. The requirements in this document do not describe what
      functions an MPLS-TP implementation supports. The purpose of this
      document is to identify the toolkit and any new protocol work that is
      required.</t>

      <t>This document is a product of a joint ITU-T and IETF effort to
      include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
      architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a
      packet transport network as defined by ITU-T. The document is a
      requirements specification, but is presented on the Standards Track so
      that it can be more easily cited as a normative reference from within
      the work of the ITU-T.</t>

      <t>This work is based on two sources of requirements, MPLS and PWE3
      architectures as defined by IETF and packet transport networks as
      defined by ITU-T. The requirements of MPLS-TP are provided below. The
      relevant functions of MPLS and PWE3 are included in MPLS-TP, except
      where explicitly excluded. Any new functionality that is defined to
      fulfill the requirements for MPLS-TP must be agreed within the IETF
      through the IETF consensus process as per <xref
      target="RFC4929"></xref>.</t>

      <t>MPLS-TP transport paths may be established using static or dynamic
      configuration. It should be noted that the MPLS-TP network and its
      transport paths can always be operated fully (including OAM and
      protection capabilities) in the absence of any control plane.</t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>Note: Mapping between the terms in this section and ITU-T
        terminology is described in <xref
        target="I-D.helvoort-mpls-tp-rosetta-stone"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The recovery requirements in this document use the recovery
        terminology defined in RFC 4427 <xref target="RFC4427"></xref>, this
        is applied to both control plane and management plane based operations
        of MPLS-TP transport paths.</t>

        <section title="Definitions">
          <t>Note: The definition of segment in a GMPLS/ASON context (i.e. as
          defined in <xref target="RFC4397">RFC4397</xref>) encompasses both
          segment and concatenated segment as defined in this document.</t>

          <t>Associated bidirectional path: A path that supports traffic flow
          in both directions but which is constructed from a pair of
          unidirectional paths (one for each direction) which are associated
          with one another at the path's ingress/egress points. The forward
          and backward directions are setup, monitored and protected
          independently. As a consequence they may or may not follow the same
          route (links and nodes) across the network.</t>

          <t>Client layer network: In a client/server relationship (see <xref
          target="ITU.G805.2000">G.805</xref>), the client layer network
          receives a (transport) service from the lower server layer network
          (usually the layer network under consideration).</t>

          <t>Concatenated Segment: A serial-compound link connection as
          defined in <xref target="ITU.G805.2000">G.805</xref>. A concatenated
          segment is a contiguous part of an LSP or multi-segment PW that
          comprises a set of segments and their interconnecting nodes in
          sequence. See also "Segment".</t>

          <t>Control Plane: Within the scope of this document the control
          plane performs transport path control functions. Through signalling,
          the control plane sets up, modifies and releases transport paths,
          and may recover a transport path in case of a failure. The control
          plane also performs other functions in support of transport path
          control, such as routing information dissemination.</t>

          <t>Co-routed Bidirectional path: A path where the forward and
          backward directions follow the same route (links and nodes) across
          the network. Both directions are setup, monitored and protected as a
          single entity. A transport network path is typically co-routed.</t>

          <t>Domain: A domain represents a collection of entities (for example
          network elements) that are grouped for a particular purpose,
          examples of which are administrative and/or managerial
          responsibilities, trust relationships, addressing schemes,
          infrastructure capabilities, aggregation, survivability techniques,
          distributions of control functionality, etc. Examples of such
          domains include IGP areas and Autonomous Systems.</t>

          <t>Layer network: Layer network is defined in <xref
          target="ITU.G805.2000">G.805</xref>. A layer network provides for
          the transfer of client information and independent operation of the
          client OAM. A Layer Network may be described in a service context as
          follows: one layer network may provide a (transport) service to
          higher client layer network and may, in turn, be a client to a lower
          layer network. A layer network is a logical construction somewhat
          independent of arrangement or composition of physical network
          elements. A particular physical network element may topologically
          belong to more than one layer network, depending on the actions it
          takes on the encapsulation associated with the logical layers (e.g.
          the label stack), and thus could be modeled as multiple logical
          elements. A layer network may consist of one or more sublayers.
          <xref target="LayerNetworkOverview"></xref> provides a more detailed
          overview of what constitutes a layer network. For additional
          explanation of how layer networks relate to the OSI concept of
          layering see Appendix I of <xref
          target="ITU.Y2611.2006">Y.2611</xref>.</t>

          <t>Link: A physical or logical connection between a pair of LSRs
          that are adjacent at the (sub)layer network under consideration. A
          link may carry zero, one or more LSPs or PWs. A packet entering a
          link will emerge with the same label stack entry values.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP Logical Ring: An MPLS-TP logical ring is constructed from
          a set of LSRs and logical data links (such as MPLS-TP LSP tunnels or
          MPLS-TP pseudowires) and physical data links that form a ring
          topology.</t>

          <t>Path: See Transport Path.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP Physical Ring: An MPLS-TP physical ring is constructed
          from a set of LSRs and physical data links that form a ring
          topology.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP Ring Topology: In an MPLS-TP ring topology each LSR is
          connected to exactly two other LSRs, each via a single
          point-to-point bidirectional MPLS-TP capable link. A ring may also
          be constructed from only two LSRs where there are also exactly two
          links. Rings may be connected to other LSRs to form a larger
          network. Traffic originating or terminating outside the ring may be
          carried over the ring. Client network nodes (such as CEs) may be
          connected directly to an LSR in the ring.</t>

          <t>Section Layer Network: A section layer is a server layer (which
          may be MPLS-TP or a different technology) which provides for the
          transfer of the section layer client information between adjacent
          nodes in the transport path layer or transport service layer. A
          section layer may provide for aggregation of multiple MPLS-TP
          clients. Note that <xref target="ITU.G805.2000">G.805</xref> defines
          the section layer as one of the two layer networks in a transmission
          media layer network. The other layer network is the physical media
          layer network.</t>

          <t>Segment: A link connection as defined in <xref
          target="ITU.G805.2000">G.805</xref>. A segment is the part of an LSP
          that traverses a single link or the part of a PW that traverses a
          single link (i.e. that connects a pair of adjacent
          {Switching|Terminating} Provider Edges). See also "Concatenated
          Segment".</t>

          <t>Server Layer Network: In a client/server relationship (see <xref
          target="ITU.G805.2000">G.805</xref>), the server layer network
          provides a (transport) service to the higher client layer network
          (usually the layer network under consideration).</t>

          <t>Sublayer: Sublayer is defined in <xref
          target="ITU.G805.2000">G.805</xref>. The distinction between a layer
          network and a sublayer is that a sublayer is not directly accessible
          to clients outside of its encapsulating layer network and offers no
          direct transport service for a higher layer (client) network.</t>

          <t>Switching Provider Edge (S-PE): See <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE): See <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Transport Path: A network connection as defined in <xref
          target="ITU.G805.2000">G.805</xref>. In an MPLS-TP environment a
          transport path corresponds to an LSP or a PW.</t>

          <t>Transport Path Layer: A (sub-)layer network that provides
          point-to-point or point-to-multipoint transport paths. It provides
          independent (of the client) OAM when transporting its clients.</t>

          <t>Transport Service Layer: A layer network in which transport paths
          are used to carry a customer&rsquo;s (individual or bundled) service
          (may be point-to-point, point-to-multipoint or
          multipoint-to-multipoint services).</t>

          <t>Transmission Media Layer: A layer network, consisting of a
          section layer network and a physical layer network as defined in
          <xref target="ITU.G805.2000">G.805</xref>, that provides sections
          (two-port point-to-point connections) to carry the aggregate of
          network transport path or network service layers on various physical
          media.</t>

          <t>Unidirectional Path: A path that supports traffic flow in only
          one direction.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Transport network overview">
        <t>The connectivity service is the basic service provided by a
        transport network. The purpose of a transport network is to carry its
        customer traffic (i.e. the stream of customer PDUs or customer bits,
        including overhead) between endpoints in the transport network
        (typically over several intermediate nodes). The connectivity services
        offered to customers are typically aggregated into large transport
        paths with long-holding times and independent OAM (of the client OAM),
        which contribute to enabling the efficient and reliable operation of
        the transport network. These transport paths are modified
        infrequently.</t>

        <t>Quality-of-service mechanisms are required in the packet transport
        network to ensure the prioritization of critical services, to
        guarantee bandwidth and to control jitter and delay. A transport
        network must provide the means to commit quality of service objectives
        to clients. This is achieved by providing a mechanism for client
        network service demarcation for the network path together with an
        associated network resiliency mechanism.</t>

        <t>Aggregation is beneficial for achieving scalability and security
        since: <list style="numbers">
            <t>It reduces the number of provisioning and forwarding states in
            the network core.</t>

            <t>It reduces load and the cost of implementing service assurance
            and fault management.</t>

            <t>Customer traffic is encapsulated and layer associated OAM
            overhead is added. This allows complete isolation of customer
            traffic and its management from carrier operations.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>An important attribute of a transport network is that it is able to
        function regardless of which clients are using its connection service
        or over which transmission media it is running. The client, transport
        network and server layers are from a functional and operations point
        of view independent layer networks. Another key characteristic of
        transport networks is the capability to maintain the integrity of the
        client across the transport network. A transport network must also
        provide a method of service monitoring in order to verify the delivery
        of an agreed quality of service. This is enabled by means of
        carrier-grade OAM tools.</t>

        <t>Customer traffic is first encapsulated within the transport service
        layer network. The transport service layer network signals may then be
        aggregated into a transport path layer network for transport through
        the network in order to optimize network management. Transport service
        layer network OAM is used to monitor the transport integrity of the
        customer traffic and transport path layer network OAM is used to
        monitor the transport integrity of the aggregates. At any hop, the
        aggregated signals may be further aggregated in lower layer transport
        network paths for transport across intermediate shared links. The
        transport service layer network signals are extracted at the edges of
        aggregation domains, and are either delivered to the customer or
        forwarded to another domain. In the core of the network, only the
        transport path layer network signals are monitored at intermediate
        points; individual transport service layer network signals are
        monitored at the network boundary. Although the connectivity of the
        transport service layer network may be point-to-point,
        point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint, the transport path
        layer network only provides point-to-point or point-to-multipoint
        transport paths which are used to carry aggregates of transport
        service layer network traffic.</t>

      <section anchor="LayerNetworkOverview" title="Layer network overview">
        <t>A layer network provides its clients with a transport service and
        the operation of the layer network is independent of whatever client
        happens to use the layer network. Information that passes between any
        client to the layer network is common to all clients and is the
        minimum needed to be consistent with the definition of the transport
        service offered. The client layer network can be connectionless,
        connection oriented packet switched, or circuit switched. The
        transport service transfers a payload (individual packet payload for
        connectionless networks, a sequence of packets payloads in the case of
        connection oriented packet switched networks, and a deterministic
        schedule of payloads in the case of circuit switched networks) such
        that the client can populate the payload without affecting any
        operation within the serving layer network.</t>

        <t>The operations within a layer network that are independent of its
        clients include the control of forwarding, the control of resource
        reservation, the control of traffic demerging, and the OAM and
        recovery of the transport service. All of these operations are
        internal to a layer network. By definition, a layer network does not
        rely on any client information to perform these operations and
        therefore all information required to perform these operations is
        independent of whatever client is using the layer network.</t>

        <t>A layer network will have consistent features in order to support
        the control of forwarding, resource reservation, OAM and recovery. For
        example, a layer network will have a common addressing scheme for the
        end points of the transport service and a common set of transport
        descriptors for the transport service. However, a client may use a
        different addressing scheme or different traffic descriptors
        (consistent with performance inheritance).</t>

        <t>It is sometimes useful to independently monitor a smaller domain
        within a layer network (or the transport services that traverse this
        smaller domain) but the control of forwarding or the control of
        resource reservation involved retain their common elements. These
        smaller monitored domains are sublayers.</t>

        <t>It is sometimes useful to independently control forwarding in a
        smaller domain within a layer network but the control of resource
        reservation and OAM retain their common elements. These smaller
        domains are partitions of the layer network.</t>

            <t>Several service providers have expressed a high level of
            interest in operating MPLS-TP in ring topologies and require a
            high level of survivability function in these topologies. The
            requirements listed below have been collected from these service
            providers and from the ITU-T.</t>

            <t>The main objective in considering a specific topology (such as
            a ring) is to determine whether it is possible to optimize any
            mechanisms such that the performance of those mechanisms within
            the topology is significantly better than the performance of the
            generic mechanisms in the same topology. The benefits of such
            optimizations are traded against the costs of developing,
            implementing, deploying, and operating the additional optimized
            mechanisms noting that the generic mechanisms MUST continue to be
            supported.</t>

            <t>Within the context of recovery in MPLS-TP networks, the
            optimization criteria considered in ring topologies are as

                trigger the recovery operation &ndash; less than are required

                <t>Minimize the number of elements of recovery in the ring
                &ndash; less than are required by other recovery
                mechanisms.</t>

                <t>Minimize the number of labels required for the protection
                paths across the ring &ndash; less than are required by other
                recovery mechanisms.</t>

                <t>Minimize the amount of control and management plane
                transactions during a maintenance operation (e.g., ring
                upgrade) &ndash; less than are required by other recovery
                mechanisms.</t>

                <t>When a control plane is supported, minimize the impact on
                signaling and routing information exchange during protection -

            <t>ITU-T Recommendation Y.2611 specifies a high-level architecture
            for future packet-based networks (FPBNs). This Recommendation also
            specifies the relationship between an FPBN and the NGN strata and
            the interfaces in an FPBN.</t>

            <t>In order to be able to provide a full suite of services
            (examples of which include data, video and voice telephony
            services) to their customers, operators may need to utilize both
            connectionless packet switched (cl-ps) and connection-oriented
            packet-switched (co-ps) transport modes. This is because each mode
            is well suited to the transport of some services and not so well
            suited to the transport of others.</t>

            <t>FPBNs provide the topmost layer(s) of the transport stratum as
            defined in ITU-T Recommendation Y.2011. The services mentioned
            above form part of the service stratum as defined in ITU-T

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In the context of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP, see <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC5654"></xref>), the rationales for Operations, Administration
      and Maintenance (OAM) are twofold as it can serve:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>as a network-oriented functionality, used by a transport network
          operator to monitor his network infrastructure and to implement
          internal mechanisms in order to enhance the general behaviour and
          the level of performance of his network (e.g., protection mechanism
          in case of node or link failure). As an example, fault localization
          is typically associated with this use case.</t>

          <t>as a service-oriented functionality, used by a transport service
          provider to monitor services offered to end customers in order to be
          able to react rapidly in case of a problem and to be able to verify
          some of the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) parameters (e.g., using
          performance monitoring) negotiated with the end customers. Note that
          a transport service could be provided over several networks or
          administrative domains that may not all be owned and managed by the
          same transport service provider.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>More generally, OAM is an important and fundamental functionality in
      transport networks as it contributes to:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>the reduction of operational complexity and costs, by allowing
          for efficient and automatic detection, localisation, handling and
          diagnosis of defects, as well as by minimizing service interruptions
          and operational repair times.</t>

          <t>the enhancement of network availability, by ensuring that
          defects, for example resulting in misdirected customer traffic, and
          faults, are detected, diagnosed and dealt with before a customer
          reports the problem.</t>

          <t>meeting service and performance objectives, as the OAM
          functionality allows for SLA verification in a multi-maintenance
          domain environment and allows for the determination of service
          degradation due, for example, to packet delay or packet loss.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Scope of this Document">
        <t>This document lists architectural and functional requirements for
        the OAM functionality of MPLS-TP. These requirements apply to
        pseudowires (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and Sections.</t>

        <t>These requirements are derived from the set of requirements
        specified by ITU-T and published in the ITU-T Supplement Y.Sup4 <xref
        target="Y.Sup4"></xref>.</t>

        <t>By covering transport specificities, these requirements complement
        those identified in RFC 4377 <xref target="RFC4377"></xref>, yet some
        requirements may be similar.</t>

        <t>This document only lists architectural and functional OAM
        requirements. It does not detail the implications of their
        applicability to the various types (e.g., point-to-point,
        point-to-multipoint, unidirectional, bidirectional ...) of PWs, LSPs
        and Sections. Furthermore, this document does not provide requirements
        on how the protocol solution(s) should behave to achieve the
        functional objectives. Please see <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"></xref> for further
        information.</t>

        <t>Note that the OAM functions identified in this document may be used
        for fault management, performance monitoring and/or protection
        switching applications. For example, connectivity verification can be
        used for fault management by detecting failure conditions, but may
        also be used for performance monitoring through its contribution to
        the evaluation of performance metrics (e.g., unavailability time).
        Nevertheless, it is outside the scope of this document to specify
        which function should be used for which application.</t>

        <t>Note also that it is anticipated that implementers may wish to
        implement OAM message handling in hardware. Although not a
        requirement, this fact could be taken as a design consideration.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Requirements Language and Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref
        target="RFC2119"></xref>. Although this document is not a protocol
        specification, the use of this language clarifies the instructions to
        protocol designers producing solutions that satisfy the requirements
        set out in this document.</t>

        <t>In this document we refer to the inability of a function to perform
        a required action, as a fault. This does not include an inability due
        to preventive maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned
        actions. See also ITU-T G.806 <xref target="G.806"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In this document we refer to the situation in which the density of
        anomalies has reached a level where the ability to perform a required
        function has been interrupted, as a defect. See also ITU-T G.806 <xref
        target="G.806"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In this document we refer to OAM actions which are carried out
        continuously or at least on long periods of time, permitting proactive
        reporting of fault and/or performance results, as proactive OAM.</t>

        <t>In this document we refer to OAM actions which are initiated via
        manual intervention for a limited time to carry out troubleshooting,
        as on-demand OAM.</t>

        <t>In this document we refer to a Label Edge Router (LER), for a given
        LSP or Section, and to a PW Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE), for a
        given PW, as an End Point. Further, we refer to a Label Switching
        Router (LSR), for a given LSP, and to a PW Switching Provider Edge
        (S-PE), for a given PW, as an Intermediate Point. This document does
        not make a distinction between End Points (e.g., source and
        destination) as it can be inferred from the context of the
        sentences.</t>

        <t>In this document we use the term "node" as a general reference to
        End Points and Intermediate Points.</t>

        <t>In this document we refer to both segment and concatenated segments
        as segments (see <xref target="RFC5654"></xref> for definitions
        relating to the term "segment" as well as for other definitions
        relating to MPLS-TP).</t>

        <t>In this document we refer to both single segment PWs and
        multi-segment PWs as PWs.</t>

        <t>In this document we refer to both bidirectional associated LSPs and
        bidirectional co-routed LSPs as bidirectional LSPs.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="OAM Requirements">
      <t>This section lists the requirements by which the OAM functionality of
      MPLS-TP should abide.</t>

      <t>The requirements listed below may be met by one or more OAM
      protocols; the definition or selection of these protocols is outside the
      scope of this document.</t>

      <t>RFC5654 <xref target="RFC5654"></xref> states (Requirement #2) that
      the MPLS-TP design SHOULD as far as reasonably possible reuse existing
      MPLS standards. This general requirement applies to MPLS-TP OAM. MPLS-TP
      OAM is defined in this document through a set of functional
      requirements. These requirements will be met by protocol solutions
      defined in other documents. The way in which those protocols are
      operated and the way in which a network operator can control and use the
      MPLS-TP OAM functions SHOULD be as similar as possible to the mechanisms
      and techniques used to operate OAM in other transport technologies.</t>

      <section title="Architectural Requirements">
        <section title="Scope of OAM">
          <t>The protocol solution(s) developed to meet the requirements
          identified in this document MUST at least be applicable to
          point-to-point bidirectional PWs, point-to-point co-routed
          bidirectional LSPs, and point-to-point bidirectional Sections. <xref
          target="FR"></xref> provides additional information with regards to
          the applicability to point-to-point associated bidirectional LSPs,
          point-to-point unidirectional LSPs and point-to-multipoint LSPs.</t>

          <t>The service emulated by a PW may span multiple domains. An LSP
          may also span multiple domains. The protocol solution(s) MUST be
          applicable end-to-end and to segments. More generally, it MUST be
          possible to operate OAM functions on a per domain basis and across
          multiple domains.</t>

          <t>Since LSPs may be stacked, the protocol solution(s) MUST be
          applicable on any LSP, regardless of the label stack depth.
          Furthermore it MUST be possible to estimate OAM fault and
          performance metrics of a single PW or LSP segment or of an aggregate
          of PWs or LSPs segments.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Independence">
          <t>The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the underlying
          tunnelling or point-to-point technology or transmission media.</t>

          <t>The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the service a
          PW may emulate.</t>

          <t>Any OAM function operated on a PW, LSP or Section SHOULD be
          independent of the OAM function(s) operated on a different PW, LSP
          or Section. In other words, only the OAM functions operated on e.g.,
          a given LSP should be used to achieve the OAM objectives for that
          LSP.</t>

          <t>The protocol solution(s) MUST support the capability to be
          concurrently and independently operated end-to-end and on segments.
          Therefore, any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or LSP
          SHOULD be independent of the OAM function(s) operated on the
          end-to-end PW or LSP. It SHOULD also be possible to distinguish an
          OAM packet running over a segment of a PW or LSP from another OAM
          packet running on the end-to-end PW or LSP.</t>

          <t>Furthermore, any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or
          LSP SHOULD be independent of the OAM function(s) applied to other
          segment(s) of the same PW or LSP.</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Note:">Independence should not be understood in
              terms of isolation as there can be interactions between OAM
              functions operated on e.g., an LSP, and on another LSP or a
              PW.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="DP" title="Data Plane">
          <t>OAM functions operate in the data plane. OAM packets MUST run
          in-band; that is, OAM packets for a specific PW, LSP or Section MUST
          follow the exact same data path as user traffic of that PW, LSP or
          Section. This is often referred to as fate sharing.</t>

          <t>It MUST be possible to discriminate user traffic from OAM
          packets. This includes a means to differentiate OAM packets from
          user traffic as well as the capability to apply specific treatment
          to OAM packets, at the nodes processing these OAM packets.</t>

          <t>As part of the design of OAM protocol solution(s) for MPLS-TP, a
          mechanism, for enabling the encapsulation and differentiation of OAM
          messages on a PW, LSP or Section, MUST be provided. Such mechanism
          SHOULD also support the encapsulation and differentiation of
          existing IP/MPLS and PW OAM messages.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="IPcap" title="OAM and IP Capabilities">
          <t>There are environments where IP capabilities are present in the
          data plane. IP/MPLS environments are examples of such environments.
          There are also environments where IP capabilities may not be present
          in the data plane. MPLS-TP environments are examples of environments
          where IP capabilities might or might not be
          present.<vspace />Presence or absence of IP capabilities is
          deployment scenario dependent.</t>

          <t>It MUST be possible to deploy the OAM functionality in any of
          these environments. As a result, it MUST be possible to operate OAM
          functions with or without relying on IP capabilities and it MUST be
          possible to choose to make use of IP capabilities when these are
          present.</t>

          <t>Furthermore, the mechanism required for enabling the
          encapsulation and differentiation of OAM messages (see <xref
          target="DP"></xref>) MUST support the capability to differentiate
          OAM messages of an OAM function operated by relying on IP
          capabilities (e.g., using encapsulation in an IP header) from OAM
          messages of an OAM function operated without relying on any IP
          capability.</t>

          <t>Note that IP capabilities include the capability to form a
          standard IP header, to encapsulate a payload in an IP header, to
          parse and analyse the fields of an IP header and to take actions
          based on the content of these fields.</t>

          <t>For certain functions, OAM messages need to incorporate
          identification information (e.g., of source and/or destination
          nodes). The protocol solution(s) MUST at least support
          identification information in the form of an IP addressing structure
          and MUST also be extensible to support additional identification
          schemes.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Interoperability and Interworking">
          <t>It is REQUIRED that OAM interoperability is achieved between
          distinct domains materializing the environments described in <xref
          target="IPcap"></xref>. It is also REQUIRED that the first two
          requirements of <xref target="IPcap"></xref> still hold and MUST
          still be met when interoperability is achieved.</t>

          <t>When MPLS-TP is run with IP routing and forwarding capabilities,
          it MUST be possible to operate any of the existing IP/MPLS and PW
          OAM protocols (e.g., LSP-Ping <xref target="RFC4379"></xref>,
          MPLS-BFD <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref>, VCCV <xref
          target="RFC5085"></xref> and VCCV-BFD <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv-bfd"></xref>).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Configuration">
          <t>OAM functions MUST operate and be configurable even in the
          absence of a control plane. Conversely, it SHOULD be possible to
          configure as well as enable/disable the capability to operate OAM
          functions as part of connectivity management and it SHOULD also be
          possible to configure as well as enable/disable the capability to
          operate OAM functions after connectivity has been established.</t>

          <t>In the latter case, the customer MUST NOT perceive service
          degradation as a result of OAM enabling/disabling. Ideally OAM
          enabling/disabling should take place without introducing any
          customer impairments (e.g., no customer packet losses). Procedures
          aimed to prevent any traffic impairment MUST be defined for the
          enabling/disabling of OAM functions.</t>

          <t>Means for configuring OAM functions and for connectivity
          management are outside the scope of this document.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="FR" title="Functional Requirements">
        <t>Hereafter are listed the required functionalities composing the
        MPLS-TP OAM toolset. The list may not be exhaustive and as such the
        OAM mechanisms developed in support of the identified requirements
        SHALL be extensible and thus SHALL NOT preclude the definition of
        additional OAM functionalities, in the future.</t>

        <t>The design of OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP, MUST allow for the
        ability to support experimental OAM functions. These functions MUST be
        disabled by default.</t>

        <t>The use of any OAM function MUST be optional and it MUST be
        possible to select the set of OAM function(s) to use on any PW, LSP or
        Section.</t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that any protocol solution, meeting one or more
        functional requirement(s), be the same for PWs, LSPs and Sections.</t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that any protocol solution, meeting one or more
        functional requirement(s), effectively provides a fully featured
        function; that is, a function which is applicable to all the cases
        identified for that functionality. In that context, protocol
        solution(s) MUST state their applicability.</t>

        <t>Unless otherwise stated, the OAM functionalities MUST NOT rely on
        user traffic; that is, only OAM messages MUST be used to achieve the
        objectives.</t>

        <t>For the on-demand OAM functions, the result of which may vary
        depending on packet size, it SHOULD be possible to perform these
        functions using different packet sizes.</t>

        <section title="General Requirements">
          <t>If a defect or fault occurs on a PW, LSP or Section, mechanisms
          MUST be provided to detect it, diagnose it, localize it, and notify
          the appropriate nodes. Mechanisms SHOULD exist such that corrective
          actions can be taken.</t>

          <t>Furthermore, mechanisms MUST be available for a service provider
          to be aware of a fault or defect affecting the service(s) he
          provides, even if the fault or defect is located outside of his
          domain.</t>

          <t>Protocol solution(s) developed to meet these requirements may
          rely on information exchange. Information exchange between various
          nodes involved in the operation of an OAM function SHOULD be
          reliable such that, for example, defects or faults are properly
          detected or that state changes are effectively known by the
          appropriate nodes.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Continuity Checks">
          <t>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide a function to enable an End
          Point to monitor the liveness of a PW, LSP or Section.</t>

          <t>This function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs
          and Sections.</t>

          <t>This function SHOULD be performed pro-actively.</t>

          <t>The protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function MUST
          also apply to point-to-point associated bidirectional LSPs,
          point-to-point unidirectional LSPs and point-to-multipoint LSPs.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Connectivity Verifications">
          <t>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide a function to enable an End
          Point to determine whether or not it is connected to specific End
          Point(s) by means of the expected PW, LSP or Section.</t>

          <t>This function SHOULD be performed pro-actively between End Points
          of PWs, LSPs and Sections.</t>

          <t>This function SHOULD be performed on-demand between End Points
          and Intermediate Points of PWs and LSPs, and between End Points of
          PWs, LSPs and Sections.</t>

          <t>The protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function
          pro-actively MUST also apply to point-to-point associated
          bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional LSPs and
          point-to-multipoint LSPs.</t>

          <t>The protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>The one-way delay is defined in <xref
              target="RFC2679"></xref> to be the time elapsed from the start
              of transmission of the first bit of a packet by an End Point
              until the reception of the last bit of that packet by the other
              End Point.</t>

              <t>The two-way delay is defined in <xref

    <section title="Congestion Considerations">
      <t>A mechanism (e.g., rate limiting) MUST be provided to prevent OAM
      packets from causing congestion in the Packet Switched Network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document, in itself, does not imply any security consideration
      but OAM, as such, is subject to several security considerations. OAM
      messages can reveal sensitive information such as passwords, performance
      data and details about e.g., the network topology.</t>

      <t>The nature of OAM therefore suggests having some form of
      authentication, authorization and encryption in place. This will prevent
      unauthorized access to MPLS-TP equipment and it will prevent third
      parties from learning about sensitive information about the transport
      network.</t>

      <t>OAM systems (network management stations) SHOULD be designed such
      that OAM functions cannot be accessed without authorization.</t>

      <t>OAM protocol solutions MUST include the facility for OAM messages to
      authenticated to prove their origin and to make sure that they are
      destined for the receiving node. The use of such facilities MUST be
      configurable.</t>

      <t>An OAM packet received over a PW, LSP or Section MUST NOT be
      forwarded beyond the End Point of that PW, LSP or Section, so as to
      avoid that the OAM packet leaves the current administrative domain.</t>

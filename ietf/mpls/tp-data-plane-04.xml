    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the set of functions that
      meet the requirements <xref target="RFC5654" /> for the application
      of MPLS to the construction and operation of packet-switched
      transport networks. MPLS-based packet-switched transport networks,
      and the overall architecture of the MPLS-TP, are defined and
      described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework" />.  It is
      assumed that the reader is familiar with that document.</t>

      <t>This document defines the set of functions that comprise the
      MPLS-TP data plane: the architectural layer concerned with the
      encapsulation and forwarding of packets within an MPLS-TP network.
      This layer is based on the data plane architectures for MPLS (<xref
      target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>) and for
      pseudowires (<xref target="RFC3985"></xref>).</t>

      architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a

        entities). Encapsulation and forwarding functions for packets
        outside an MPLS-TP LSP, PW, or Section, and mechanisms for

    <section title="MPLS-TP Packet Encapsulation and Forwarding" anchor="pencap">
      <t>MPLS-TP packet encapsulation and forwarding SHALL operate
      according to the MPLS data plane architecture described in <xref
      target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>, and the
      data plane architectures for Single-Segment Pseudowires and
      Multi-Segment Pseudowires (see <xref target="pw" />), except as
      noted otherwise in this document.  The MPLS-TP data plane satisfies
      the requirements specified in <xref target="RFC5654" />.  </t>

      <t>Since an MPLS-TP packet is an MPLS packet as defined in <xref
      target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>, it
      will have an associated label stack, and the 'push', 'pop', and
      'swap' label processing operations specified in those documents
      apply.  The label stack represents a hierarchy of Label Switched
      Paths (LSPs).  A label is pushed to introduce an additional
      level of LSP hierarchy and popped to remove it.  Such an
      additional level may be introduced by any pair of LSRs,
      whereupon they become adjacent at this new level, and are then
      known as Label Edge Routers (LERs) with respect to the new
      LSP.</t>

      <t>In contrast to, for example, Section 3.10 of <xref
      target="RFC3031" />, support for Internet Protocol (IP) host and
      router data plane functionality by MPLS-TP interfaces and in
      MPLS-TP networks is OPTIONAL.</t>

      <t>MPLS-TP forwarding is based on the label that identifies an LSP
      or PW.  The label value specifies the processing operation to be
      performed by the next hop at that level of encapsulation.  A swap of
      this label is an atomic operation in which the contents of the
      packet after the swapped label are opaque to the forwarding
      function. The only event that interrupts a swap operation is Time To
      Live (TTL) expiry.</t>

      <t>At an LSR, S-PE, or T-PE, further processing to determine the
      context of a packet occurs when a swap operation is interrupted by
      TTL expiry. If the TTL of an LSP label expires, then the label with
      the S (Bottom of Stack) bit set is inspected to determine if it is a
      reserved label. If it is a reserved label, the packet is processed
      according to the rules of that reserved label. For example, if it is
      a Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL), then it is processed as a
      packet on the G-ACh; see <xref target="gach"></xref>. If the TTL of
      a PW expires at an S-PE or T-PE, then the packet is examined to
      determine if a Generic Associated Channel Header (ACH) is present
      immediately below the PW label. If so, then the packet is processed
      as a packet on the G-ACh.</t>

      <t>Similarly, if a pop operation at an LER exposes a reserved
      label at the top of the label stack, then the packet is
      processed according to the rules of that reserved label.</t>

      <t>If no such exception occurs, the packet is forwarded according to
      the procedures in <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The MPLS Transport Profile includes the following data plane

      <section title="Label Switched Paths">
        <t>MPLS-TP LSPs are ordinary MPLS LSPs as defined in <xref
        target="RFC3031"></xref> except as specifically noted otherwise in
        this document.</t>

        <section title="LSP Packet Encapsulation and Forwarding">
          <t>Encapsulation and forwarding of packets traversing MPLS-TP
          LSPs MUST follow standard MPLS packet encapsulation and
          forwarding as defined in <xref target="RFC3031"></xref>, <xref
          target="RFC3032"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5331"></xref>, and
          <xref target="RFC5332"></xref>, except as explicitly stated
          otherwise in this document.</t>

          <t>Data plane Quality of Service capabilities are included in
          the MPLS-TP in the form of Traffic Engineered (TE) LSPs <xref
          target="RFC3209"></xref> and the MPLS Differentiated Services
          (DiffServ) architecture <xref target="RFC3270"></xref>. Both
          E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS DiffServ modes are included. The Traffic
          Class field (formerly the EXP field) of an MPLS label follows
          the definition of <xref target="RFC5462"></xref> and <xref
          target="RFC3270"></xref> and MUST be processed according to the
          rules specified in those documents.</t>

          <t>Except for transient packet reordering which may occur, for
          example, during fault conditions, packets are delivered in order
          on L-LSPs, and on E-LSPs within a specific ordered
          aggregate.</t>

          <t>The Uniform, Pipe and Short Pipe DiffServ tunneling and TTL
          processing models described in <xref target="RFC3270"></xref>
          and <xref target="RFC3443"></xref> MAY be used for MPLS-TP LSPs.
          Note however that support for the Pipe or Short Pipe models is
          REQUIRED for typical transport applications, in which the
          topology and QoS characteristics of the MPLS-TP server layer are
          independent of the client layer.  Specific applications MAY
          place further requirements on the DiffServ tunneling and TTL
          processing models an LSP can use.</t>

          <t>Per-platform, per-interface or other context-specific label
          space <xref target="RFC5331"></xref> MAY be used for MPLS-TP
          LSPs.  Downstream <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> or upstream
          <xref target="RFC5331"></xref> label allocation schemes MAY be
          used for MPLS-TP LSPs. The requirements of a particular LSP type
          may, however, dictate which label spaces or allocation schemes
          it can use.</t>

          <t>Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) load-balancing MUST NOT be
          performed on an MPLS-TP LSP.  MPLS-TP LSPs as defined in this
          document MAY operate over a server layer that supports
          load-balancing, but this load-balancing MUST operate in such a
          manner that it is transparent to MPLS-TP.  This does not
          preclude the future definition of new MPLS-TP LSP types which
          have different requirements regarding the use of ECMP in the
          server layer.</t>

          <t>Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) MUST be disabled by default on
          MPLS-TP LSPs.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="LSP Payloads">
          <t>The MPLS-TP includes support for the following LSP payload
          types:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Network-layer protocol packets (including MPLS-labeled
              packets)</t>
              <t>Pseudowire packets</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>The rules for processing LSP payloads that are network-layer
          protocol packets SHALL be as specified in <xref
          target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The rules for processing LSP payloads that are pseudowire
          packets SHALL be as defined in the data plane pseudowire
          specifications (see <xref target="pw"></xref>).</t>

          <t>The payload of an MPLS-TP LSP may be a packet that itself
          contains an MPLS label stack.  This is true, for instance, when
          the payload is a pseudowire or an MPLS LSP.  In such cases, the
          label stack is contiguous between the MPLS-TP LSP and its
          payload, and exactly one LSE in this stack SHALL have the S
          (Bottom of Stack) bit set to 1.  This behaviour reflects best
          current practice in MPLS but differs slightly from <xref
          target="RFC3032" />, which uses the S bit to identify when MPLS
          label processing stops and network layer processing starts.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="lsptypes" title="LSP Types">
          <t>The MPLS-TP includes the following LSP types:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Point-to-point unidirectional</t>

              <t>Point-to-point associated bidirectional</t>

              <t>Point-to-point co-routed bidirectional</t>

              <t>Point-to-multipoint unidirectional</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Point-to-point unidirectional LSPs are supported by the basic
          MPLS architecture <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> and are
          REQUIRED to function in the same manner in the MPLS-TP data
          plane except as explicitly stated otherwise in this
          document.</t>

          <t>A point-to-point associated bidirectional LSP between LSRs A
          and B consists of two unidirectional point-to-point LSPs, one
          from A to B and the other from B to A, which are regarded as a
          pair providing a single logical bidirectional transport
          path.</t>

          <t>A point-to-point co-routed bidirectional LSP is a
          point-to-point associated bidirectional LSP with the additional
          constraint that its two unidirectional component LSPs in each
          direction follow the same path (in terms of both nodes and
          links).  An important property of co-routed bidirectional LSPs
          is that their unidirectional component LSPs share fate.</t>

          <t>A point-to-multipoint unidirectional LSP functions in the
          same manner in the data plane, with respect to basic label
          processing and packet-switching operations, as a point-to-point
          unidirectional LSP, with one difference: an LSR may have more
          than one (egress interface, outgoing label) pair associated with
          the LSP, and any packet it transmits on the LSP is transmitted
          out all associated egress interfaces.  Point-to-multipoint LSPs
          are described in <xref target="RFC4875"></xref> and <xref
          target="RFC5332"></xref>.  TTL processing and exception handling
          for point-to-multipoint LSPs is the same as for point-to-point
          LSPs and is described in <xref target="pencap" />.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Sections">
        <t>Two MPLS-TP LSRs are considered to be topologically adjacent at
        a particular layer n &gt;= 0 of the MPLS-TP LSP hierarchy if there
        exists connectivity between them at the next lowest network layer,
        and if there is no MPLS layer processing at layer n between the
        two LSRs (other than at the LSRs themselves).  Such connectivity,
        if it exists, will be either an MPLS-TP LSP (if n &gt; 0) or a
        data-link provided by the underlying server layer network (if n =
        0), and is referred to as an MPLS-TP Section at layer n of the
        MPLS-TP LSP hierarchy.  Thus, the links traversed by a layer n+1
        MPLS-TP LSP are layer n MPLS-TP sections.  Such an LSP is referred
        to as a client of the section layer, and the section layer as the
        server layer with respect to its clients.</t>

        <t>The MPLS label stack associated with an MPLS-TP section at
        layer n consists of n labels, in the absence of stack optimisation
        mechanisms.  In order for two LSRs to exchange non-IP MPLS-TP
        control packets over a section, an additional label, the G-ACh
        Label (GAL) (see <xref target="gach"></xref>) MUST appear at the
        bottom of the label stack.</t>

        <t>An MPLS-TP section may provide one or more of the following
        types of service to its client layer:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Point-to-point bidirectional</t>
            <t>Point-to-point unidirectional</t>
            <t>Point-to-multipoint unidirectional</t>
          </list>
        The manner in which a section provides such a service is outside
        the scope of the MPLS-TP.</t>

        <t>An LSP of any of the types listed in <xref
        target="lsptypes"></xref> may serve as a section for a
        client-layer transport entity as long as it supports the type of
        service the client requires.</t>

        <t>A section MUST provide a means of identifying the type of
        payload it carries.  If the section is a data-link, link-specific
        mechanisms such as a protocol type indication in the data-link
        header MAY be used.  If the section is an LSP, this information MAY
        be implied by the LSP label or, if the LSP payload is
        MPLS-labeled, by the setting of the S bit.  Additional labels MAY
        also be used if necessary to distinguish different payload types;

    <section anchor="gach" title="MPLS-TP Generic Associated Channel">
      <t>The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) mechanism is
      specified in <xref target="RFC5586"></xref> and included in the
      MPLS-TP.  The G-ACh provides an auxiliary logical data channel
      associated with MPLS-TP Sections, LSPs, and PWs in the data plane.
      The primary purpose of the G-ACh in the context of MPLS-TP is to
      support control, management, and Operations, Administration and
      Maintenance (OAM) traffic associated with MPLS-TP transport
      entities. The G-ACh MUST NOT be used to transport client layer
      network traffic in MPLS-TP networks.</t>

      <t>For pseudowires, the G-ACh uses the first four bits of the PW
      control word to provide the initial discrimination between data
      packets and packets belonging to the associated channel, as
      described in <xref target="RFC4385"></xref>.  When this first nibble
      of a packet, immediately following the label at the bottom of stack,
      has a value of '1', then this packet belongs to a G-ACh.  The first
      32 bits following the bottom of stack label then have a defined
      format called an Associated Channel Header (ACH), which further
      defines the content of the packet.  The ACH is therefore both a
      demultiplexer for G-ACh traffic on the PW, and a discriminator for
      the type of G-ACh traffic.</t>

      <t>When the control message is carried over a section or an LSP,
      rather than over a PW, it is necessary to provide an indication in
      the packet that the payload is something other than a client data
      packet.  This is achieved by including a reserved label with a value
      of 13 at the bottom of the label stack.  This reserved label is
      referred to as the G-ACh Label (GAL), and is defined in <xref
      target="RFC5586"></xref>. When a GAL is found, it indicates that the
      payload begins with an ACH. The GAL is thus a demultiplexer for
      G-ACh traffic on the section or the LSP, and the ACH is a
      discriminator for the type of traffic carried on the G-ACh.  MPLS-TP
      forwarding follows the normal MPLS model, and thus a GAL is
      invisible to an LSR unless it is the top label in the label
      stack. The only other circumstance under which the label stack may
      be inspected for a GAL is when the TTL has expired.  Normal packet
      forwarding MAY continue concurrently with this inspection. All
      operations on the label stack are in accordance with <xref
      target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

      <t>An application processing a packet received over the G-ACh
      may require packet-specific context (such as the receiving
      interface or received label stack).  Data plane implementations
      MUST therefore provide adequate context to the application which
      is to process a G-ACh packet.  The definition of the context
      required MUST be provided as part of the specification of the
      application using the G-ACh.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Server Layer Considerations">
      <t>The MPLS-TP network has no awareness of the internals of the
      server layer of which it is a client, requiring only that the server
      layer be capable of delivering the type of service required by the
      MPLS-TP transport entities that make use of it.  Note that what
      appears to be a single server layer link to the MPLS-TP network may
      be a complicated construct underneath, such as an LSP or a
      collection of underlying links operating as a bundle.  Special care
      may be needed in network design and operation when such constructs
      are used as a server layer for MPLS-TP.</t>

      <t>Encapsulation of MPLS-TP packets for transport over specific
      server-layer media is outside the scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The MPLS data plane (and therefore the MPLS-TP data plane) does
      not provide any security mechanisms in and of itself.  Client layers
      that wish to secure data carried over MPLS-TP transport entities are
      REQUIRED to apply their own security mechanisms.</t>

      <t>Where management or control plane protocols are used to install
      label switching operations necessary to establish MPLS-TP transport
      paths, those protocols are equipped with security features and
      network operators may use those features to securely create the
      transport paths.</t>

      <t>Where enhanced security is desirable, and a trust relationship
      exists between an LSR and its peer, the LSR MAY choose to implement
      the following policy for the processing of MPLS packets received
      from one or more of its neighbours:
        <list style="empty">
          <t>Upon receipt of an MPLS packet, discard the packet unless one
          of the following two conditions holds:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Any MPLS label in the packet's label stack processed at the
            receiving LSR, such as an LSP or PW label, has a label value
            that the receiving LSR has distributed to that neighbour;
            or</t>

            <t>Any MPLS label in the packet's label stack processed at the
            receiving LSR, such as an LSP or PW label, has a label value
            that the receiving LSR has previously distributed to the peer
            beyond that neighbour (i.e., when it is known that the path
            from the system to which the label was distributed to the
            receiving system is via that neighbour).</t>
          </list>
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
